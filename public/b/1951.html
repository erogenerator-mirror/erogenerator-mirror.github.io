You just go back to sleep."</p> <p>I just kept drifting off. I couldn't wake anyone. When it was finally over, I was still naked and cuddled in Sam's arms. I could still feel her body around me. I loved the way it felt around me, it felt different from being in Sam's embrace. I closed my eyes and relaxed.</p> <p>"God, Sam," I heard from across the room. I looked up and Sam was smiling at me. "What time is it?"</p> <p>I looked down as I realized she didn't bother going to get dressed. "Almost six thirty. Do you want to go out or should I?"</p> <p>"I want to be with you, Sam." Even then, I couldn't bring myself to speak. I was in turmoil, a million things running through my head. One of them was that I had to have her.</p> <p>Sam and I talked for another half hour. After a few minutes, she said, "You know, I have to be going. I really did enjoy the time that you had with me."</p> <p>I didn't say a thing.</p> <p>She was standing with her arm around my neck and her eyes were looking into mine. I just turned my head and kissed her on the lips, and she let go of my neck so I could kiss her a little on the mouth. "Sam, I want to say everything that was in my mind and that I feel about you."</p> <p>She smiled. "I want to hear all of the things that were going through your head."</p> <p>"How are you feeling? I'll tell you later."</p> <p>"It feels a little different knowing you are with me. It is different that I can see you and that you are mine."</p> <p>"How can it be different? I'm not going anywhere with you. You have to be in some kind of place that I don't know. Please don't try to have a relationship with me."</p> <p>"I would like to be with you, Sam. I hope I can have a relationship with you."</p> <p>She smiled again and started to stand up, but I stopped her.</p> <p>"Let me take you to dinner. I have no appetite tonight." I was smiling as she said that, not wanting to stop and ruin our friendship.</p> <p>I felt as if I'd been punched in the heart. "I don't really like being in a place like that. I don't get to go out very often and I find that my friends are so nice or there's no place else for me. What's going on with me? Are you mad at me?"</p> <p>Sam smiled again and her smile was full of love. She was loving what I'd done to her. She'd done it for me. She really was something to be treasured and I was really lucky, because I never did enjoy myself very much. I found that I enjoyed it more every day after that.</p> <p>I put my arm around her and turned to go to sleep.</p> <p>Sam was still holding me. She was thinking about me. She was looking into my eyes. I could feel that she looked into mine. The sadness was gone.</p> <p>"You look so good. Are you trying to tell me everything that you have to tell me about yourself?" A tear slid down my cheek. Sam pressed her lips to mine. Her tongue parted my lips. "Honey, don't worry."</p> <p>I reached to stroke her face as her eyes closed and drifted off.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>The next morning, I woke up and realized it was daylight. I remembered that Sam had left our bedroom and was gone when I walked out, but it didn't last very long. I was still feeling her embrace even though I'd been alone. I was feeling that it was almost over.</p> <p>Sam had been in the room, dressed and in the bath when I woke up. She had been just wearing a towel and was sitting in the middle of the bed. She was smiling at me as if she was expecting me to come to her and give her a hug and then go back to sleep.</p> <p>I looked at her. "You look great, Sam." I tried to look into her eyes as I said it. She smiled again and I just nodded my head. She was beautiful. Her eyes were blue and her skin was a light olive color. Her hair was down and was a perfect contrast to her pale white skin. I could feel her body tense as she looked at me. It was like watching a battle, and it was so beautiful.</p> <p>"Do you remember how you talked about that afternoon in the gym at the gym? About how we should work out together? I remember that and it felt like the real world. I wasn't the one talking about it but you were when you were trying to convince me."</p> <p>"And youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
