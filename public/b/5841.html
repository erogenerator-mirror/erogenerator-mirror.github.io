She murmured back, taking my cock into her mouth. I reached out to her breast, cupping it firmly, feeling the slight weight of it, the softness of it, and caressing the nipple. My hand went towards my cock and I touched it, running my fingers along its length.</p> <p>"I really want these on!" I whispered, pulling her towards me. I kissed her on her mouth, running my tongue into it, sucking it. I was on my knees quickly again and I could smell her scent from there.</p> <p>The top of the bikini top was being pulled down. She did the honors herself, releasing it completely from her chest. The top slid downward and the bikini puddled around her feet, giving me a brief glimpse of her breasts for the first time. I reached out and touched her roundness, tracing her nipple.</p> <p>She moaned as my fingers trailed down her stomach, past her belly button, touching the base of her navel. She reached out and grabbed a breast with both hands. We kissed again, deeply, exploring each others mouths, tongues reaching out to touch all over the other in a long, sensual search.</p> <p>I ran my tongue over her bottom lip, feeling the weight and soft texture. I wanted to suck on it, but she grabbed my head and held it, kissing me more passionately now, thrusting her tongue into my mouth. I took the opportunity to push my hand beneath the bottoms of the bikini.</p> <p>This time I wasn't shy. I took the time to explore her body, feeling every ripple, every curve in her. The bottoms of her breasts had the effect of raising her nipples to full attention, which they did, pushing them toward me.</p> <p>She pushed mine away, looking into my eyes, and gave me a smile. I smiled as she reached behind her and unclasped her top, pushing it free from her breasts. I took off my top, revealing my own breasts. I leaned forward and kissed my nipples, running my fingers along them, feeling how soft and pliable the skin was.</p> <p>I ran my fingers up one of her breasts. It was larger than I expected, but her breast seemed perfectly round, like a ripe apple. I ran my hand over it and then between to feel the curve it created, and ran my fingers across her nipple. It hardened, sending a new wave of pleasure through the entire small breast and its hard tip. I took it into my mouth as far as I could with each stroke, flicking the tip with my tongue.</p> <p>She was moaning now, and her hips lifted off the deck. I took one of her nipples in between my fingers, running my tongue and teeth over it, squeezing it firmly with my hand. She was gasping now. "What do you want me to do?" I asked. She hesitated, then slowly pulled the bottoms of her bikini down her legs, one by one, exposing her sex to the elements. I ran my other hand over her mound, my hand finding her slit already.</p> <p>My cock was raging, and it needed some release now. I reached under my bottom and found her pussy, feeling how hot it was, the wetness. I slid my fingers down, tracing it, feeling the hard nub as I fingered her. I was amazed at how much I could feel her pussy, the moistness and puffy swollen lips, and how sensitive it was. I couldn't keep my middle digit inside of her, but I kept massaging it, getting it to slip in and out as I fingered her.</p> <p>I could see her thighs quivering, and, sensing that she was enjoying this, I went to her clitoris, running my finger across it, feeling it swelling, growing and stiffening. I started to circle the small tip of her clit with my finger, and then I slid it down between her lips to feel the wetness, the heat, the texture of her. I knew she wanted a cock, I knew she wanted sex, I knew.</p> <p>She was moaning now, writhing herself on the rough and dark part of the deck, pushing her clitoris deep against my finger. Her breathing was ragged now, and her breasts were moving up and down. Her hands clutched at my face as her moans turned into cries, now one after the other, her orgasm rising, rising and rising, her cries getting louder and louder.</p> <p>I removed my finger, pulling my upper leg up to lie over hers. It didn't feel cramped with just my finger. But I could feel her thighs tighten around me, and, looking at her, saw the moisture there, running down her legs like she never had before. For me it was the sight of the girl on the deck, the girl I had just used, the girl I had always lusted overâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
