We decided not to have sex but to wait.</p> <p>She arrived in the late afternoon with a pizza and ice cream. We continued our dinner chatting as it got later in the afternoon. I had just turned 18 and I was feeling happy with myself when she came into the kitchen.</p> <p>“Hey!” she exclaimed.</p> <p>“Oh hey Kim,” I said, “what’s up?” I continued.</p> <p>“Nothing much. I just wanted to make a wish and get back to you.” She continued in a happy voice.</p> <p>“I still feel like I am 18 but I am not so young anymore. I was really horny back then so I was hoping you and Rick would join me,” I said, as I watched her eyes widen with excitement.</p> <p>“Of course you will. If you want to join me, it is okay, I do have this.”</p> <p>She just laughed her cute little laugh again and leaned in to hug me. I felt as if I had been caught in the middle of a hurricane.</p> <p>I pulled her around in a hug feeling her tits push into me. I could feel my cock hardening as I felt her skin pressing into me. There wasn’t much to hold on to and the feel of her soft tits pressing into my chest made my cock react to her. I held her tight feeling her tight tit-bits press into me.</p> <p>She whispered very quietly, “Do you like what you feel?””</p> <p>I replied yes, my cock was rock hard and pushing up against her. Her tits felt good as I squeezed them pressing them softly against her.</p> <p>We stopped breathing as her body relaxed against mine and she leaned back against the stove. I could feel her hand rubbing my cock through my pants.</p> <p>“Are you ready?” I asked, as we held each other.</p> <p>“Oh yes!” she responded as she leaned in to kiss me. She put her hands in mine and squeezed lightly.</p> <p>“Are we ready for sex now? It sounds great but right now we both want it.” I said as I pulled her back as tight against me.</p> <p>“I agree, but I am not yet sure if there is anything we can do to do. I don’t know if we should do this first or if we should stop,” she said.</p> <p>“Let’s take it slow and let my cock get comfortable,” I said.</p> <p>With that Kim kissed me as her hands slid over my chest.</p> <p>As she pulled me out of the kitchen and towards my front door, I could hear her saying it again and again, ”What are we thinking and what are we going to do?”.</p> <p>There was nothing to be said. I felt very turned on by the whole moment. I wanted to know what she was thinking. If I was ready, would she really go for it?</p> <p>We kissed a lot. As much as I wanted to just take this, I kept thinking about the future of our friendship and what she had seen to me with Rick. She was my friend and I would always do what she wanted to me. Did I have anything to lose? I just wondered.</p> <p>Our embrace, I pushed my pelvis into her crotch and heard Kim moan. It was obvious that I could have got a hard-on or gotten us both excited by any of this, but I did no such thing. As I kissed her, she put her hands on my shoulders again and pulled me tight to her.</p> <p>She ran her fingers through my hair and started slowly brushing them over my neck.</p> <p>With my head resting on her shoulder I started to kiss her neck. Slowly kissing and biting her neck gently. Then she kissed my ear as her hand went between us and started to rub my cock through my slacks.</p> <p>I had been having problems getting the buttons of my shirt undone in the kitchen. As Kim felt her way through the kitchen, she would pull my slacks down with my slacks. I could feel her hands moving in under her clothes as they slid my slacks.</p> <p>As she was still kissing my neck between kisses, she started to unbutton my top button, sliding the zipper down. When she got all of the button undone, I felt she was pulling my slacks down to my mid-thigh and pulled the slacks all the way down on my legs making me step out of them.</p> <p>At that point she stood up and took my hand leading me to the center of the room. She turned on the small stereo and came to us both with candles—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
