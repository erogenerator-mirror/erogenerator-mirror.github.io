Let me know how it turns out!"</p> <p>My father's smile made me feel as if I was in an angel's prison.</p> <p>~*~*~*~*~*~*</p> <p>My parents left around 3 PM. The three of us sat and talked for over an hour. Our conversation on the matter was about my plans. My father had talked about the new job he had in a department near where he was going, where I worked, and so on. My mother came over for another hour and we sat in the living room.</p> <p>"I am so glad you're home. I'm getting into work and so will you. I'm not sure if I could be more thankful for this."</p> <p>My father took my hand and kissed it again. Then he asked, "How does your mother feel?"</p> <p>"She feels good, not as good as us, it was a great day for us. We just need to plan on doing more good to our marriage. I was just thinking about where you are going to spend Christmas. I hope we can make a good impression on you!"</p> <p>"Why can't you?" my father asked while I smiled and took his hand.</p> <p>"I couldn't possibly, I would be too busy, but I can't help myself. I need to know I am not neglecting you, your wife. I want, maybe even want, a proper Christmas to you and if that gets you a Christmas wish, I'm sorry I can't make it. All you have to do is say yes! I promise!"</p> <p>I was nervous. I was worried that the two of us would talk too soon. I knew my parents would think we were in a hurry and would get over a bit if I said yes. But I had to know this time would have a positive results.</p> <p>My father's hands made my fingers tremble. I was smiling as my mind raced.</p> <p>My father pulled down my blouse and started kissing my bare shoulders. I closed my eyes, trying to calm myself down for the moment that would end in a great moment.</p> <p>It did. I opened my eyes, and my father stood up and stepped back. He picked up my blouse and began to unbutton it. His voice was deep as he said, "We need to do this our way."</p> <p>My father's eyes locked onto mine and my breathing changed. I could barely take it. I raised my arms to him, which he responded eagerly by placing on my shoulders and slowly sliding the material of my blouse out of the way, revealing more than just my breasts. Then he reached behind and undid my bra, which I allowed to fall to the floor.</p> <p>I could barely contain my desire as my dad kissed down the side of my right breast to it's pink and tender summit. I felt the heat of his breath against my skin as he took my nipple into his mouth. The feeling of his hands running up underneath my skirt was erotic as it made my head swoon all over again.</p> <p>The feeling of his soft lips encasing my nipple made my nipples harden even more. My father moved toward my other breast to do the same. When his lips touched my nipple my pussy throbbed even more. If I had to explain, he was going to be my teacherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
