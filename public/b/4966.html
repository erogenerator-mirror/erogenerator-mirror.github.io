I'm Sam. How do you like my body?"</p> <p>I think I looked like a giddy schoolgirl when I spoke. "It's much nicer than I'd thought. I could use the extra room."</p> <p>"I agree, I have a good view from down the hallway. I'm sure you can use this place." She giggled.</p> <p>We chatted for a minute and I felt the warmth in my pussy and the swelling in my hips. Sam's hands on my waist and waist as we walked passed her and she reached down to caress my pussy under my skirt and my nipples pouted. "I'm a little disappointed in myself. I'm a woman, but I can't help liking what I see." She rubbed my pussy through my panties and gave my nipples a twist through my blouse. They immediately hardened. She had stopped rubbing my pussy and was studying me with interest. As she worked on my nipples I was getting more turned on by my own excitement.</p> <p>We stopped so that she could step back and enjoy the view of her body. She was a little bigger than me but didn't seem to worry too much about it. My long dark hair cascaded in my shoulders and my body moved seductively as I looked at the other woman in the café. Sam was staring at me, as I stood there, almost hypnotically, while talking to this other man. I could see her pupils were dilated and a sparkle was forming in her eyes. I reached for the zipper on her shirt and she stopped me. "I can't." She said and she fumbled with the top button of her shirt.</p> <p>"No!" I laughed, "I can't get out of this shirt. Let me in so I can see you."</p> <p>She turned her back to me and she turned on her side, bent over at the waist, and exposed a nice ass. I don't know why it turned me on so, but I was about to make a move. I reached around her and slowly slid the zipper down. My fingers traced over the curve of her ass along the outside of her panties.</p> <p>"No!" she laughed, "this is ridiculous. I want to see how your tits look like."</p> <p>"You know you are a very beautiful woman," I replied. I pulled her toward me and she turned toward me. I lifted her shirt and I could see her nipples pointing straight at me. I lifted it up over her head and saw that it wasn't tied in a tie. It wasn't so much. In fact, it came down almost to her waist and came on a small string about the middle of her belly button. This wasn't what I was looking for, but I was thinking the same thing. I looked down at her panties. They were a little damp.</p> <p>"You are very beautiful. I guess you're enjoying these pants." She lifted her legs and then spread them a little and there they were. What I thought I had seen were three sets of panties. There was no bra, just the thin silk that came down in a little string and clung to her mound. I leaned down and kissed the left one. Then I kissed the right one.</p> <p>"I don't have anything that you don't have."</p> <p>"Well, this is it," and I put on the panties and slipped them on over my ass.</p> <p>"This is it?"</p> <p>"It is the first moment of excitement you have ever experienced."</p> <p>"If you really want to taste this, I'd love to. It is rather intoxicating."</p> <p>"Well, I don't. I mean, it's very personal."</p> <p>"I don't care. Let's just get out and enjoy the show." As I stood up, my skirt slid to the floor. I didn't stop pulling at the buttons. I was a little nervous as I stood there as if afraid that anyone would see me, but I had a strong feeling that if this continued I would get very aroused. As I reached for the next piece of clothing, my pussy had a very definite ache. I tried to be careful and not let my legs fall open too far. What would the man in the car think if he got caught looking at a young woman and getting caught?</p> <p>What was she doing to me?</p> <p>In the other café, we were standing near a door, and my skirt dropped. That was another question. I felt as if I had no more than ten minutes before I had to do something about my skirt that was still standing there.</p> <p>"I'm sorry."</p> <p>"Don't feel bad. A little flustered, but no problem. How about you get in the back as we walk away?"</p> <p>I had no problem getting in the back door and sliding the zipper up.
