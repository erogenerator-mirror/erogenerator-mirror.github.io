"The best way is if you are comfortable and can keep going without complaining. That is what I want."</p> <p>Amber smiled and looked him in the eyes, "I don't know. I'm a bit sore to be honest, but I have to admit I'm a bit disappointed," She smiled at me, "I'm also still having trouble believing that what I just said is true."</p> <p>"It is true. I am quite surprised too of course," I said, "That is just a bit of our story to tell, not to mention what we discussed yesterday at your work meeting. As far as I'm concerned, we are all still friends and that is an important part of why, when we all agreed to start the process of becoming friends in the first place."</p> <p>"What happens here stays here," she said happily, "Let's just let it be and keep going."</p> <p>"All right," I agreed and smiled, "I still have a hard time believing what I just did."</p> <p>Amber smiled at me and started rubbing her feet against my dick again, "You're more than just a friend, you're also a lover," she said with a wink.</p> <p>"Are we going to have our normal relationship again?" I asked with my heart racing in excitement.</p> <p>Amber laughed, "I hope so."</p> <p>"Do you remember what it was like to have a secret lover on your arm?" I questioned her while I leaned up against the car with her leaning on my shoulder.</p> <p>Amber's voice was so light and playful as she reached over and touched my cheek before turning me around and leaning over and kissing me.</p> <p>After we broke our embrace I opened the car door and handed her the keys, "Don't forget," I smiled, "You're going to have to drive home because you need to get home early tonight."</p> <p>"Oh! I was worried that you might change your mind after you left today," she smiled.</p> <p>"You worry too much?" I replied as I leaned down on the hood as she got off me and leaned against the car.</p> <p>"I didn't know how long it would take you to get home until you decided to go shopping," she said as she rested her head on my shoulder.</p> <p>"We aren't shopping," I countered, "I'm going to tell you everything if that's what you want to hear," I said as Amber closed her eyes and leaned over to kiss me.</p> <p>"Don't forget that I told you what I really wanted to tell you," she grinned as I moved over and gave her a tender kiss.</p> <p>As she returned the kiss I reached over and pulled the car over into a parking spot. As we both got out I took her hand and we got back into the car. I could see in the rear view mirror that she had her hand in my lap again but she had her eyes closed and her mouth slightly open.</p> <p>As I leaned over to kiss her again Amber slid closer to me. She put her arms around me and held me tight. As I took her in my arms and held her as I felt her breast with my hand I began to wonder if this was a dream.</p> <p>Amber pushed me away and looked at me with a half smile, "What?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don't know what's gotten into you at the time, but I can't say that I blame you. You are very special," I said as I moved my hands down toward her thighs where I could feel the soft lace of her panties.</p> <p>"Don't you wanna come over to my place for coffee or something?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don't think coffee would be good right now," I replied as I turned off of her road.</p> <p>"Oh, okay," she smiled and continued smiling, "So I just want to come over. I don't want to just have some kind of sex with you, I want us to be able to spend some quality time together."</p> <p>"As you wish," I replied and put the car into gear, "That's nice of you."</p> <p>After a short pause she added, "Do you know when you should stop?" she asked as she adjusted the top of her skirt which was still around her waist.</p> <p>I looked back again and her eyes looked into mine but she was not looking back. She had a sexy smile but it wasn't as if she was looking any direction, but instead her eyes were locked on mine and her lips were softly brushing against mine.</p> <p>"Tomorrow night I'll come over and you can decide," I said as I turned the car into my parking spot.</p> <p>The drive back to my flat was somewhatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
