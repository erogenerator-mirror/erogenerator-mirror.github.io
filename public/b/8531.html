He whispered.</p> <p>The bed creaked and creaked as he moved next to her, his arms reaching up for her, their bodies moving against each other without a spoken word. Slowly, as the bed creaked, the movement of the mattress and of the two of them caused the sheet to move, pressing against her skin as it parted. His fingers began to slowly slide along her back...</p> <p>...as they both watched the sheet move and slid down...</p> <p>...as they both gasped in the soft touch of each other as if in pain. The bed trembled from the contact of the sheet..</p> <p>...as they both watched the sheet move against him...as the bed creaked and creaked...</p> <p>...the movement of mattress against flesh. Their breathy sounds. Then silence...</p> <p>...until they heard the soft sound of his hand moving softly...</p> <p>...and the soft sound of his lips on hers. Their lips moving gently...</p> <p>...kissing...</p> <p>...their hands sliding along the covers.</p> <p>...their hands moving.</p> <p>"Mmmm.." He kissed her cheek. Her ear and neck. Her mouth opened...her breathy moans.</p> <p>"mmmm" she moaned quietly, her hand covering hers. Her hand softly caressing herself. Her breathing quickening as it did so. As he moved himself to the side of the bed...his hand sliding down her body. Then back up to her neck and neck again. Her breath quicken yet as they kissed as they rubbed against each other. His hand moving across her hip slowly...his fingers sliding the edge of the sheet away as his hand slides inside the gown...</p> <p>His hand moved slowly moving against her hip...her hand caressing her breast as she moaned again.</p> <p>"Mmmm" he moaned softly...as her hand softly stroked his...as they kissed...as they rubbed against each other slowly...as they caressed....</p> <p>"mmmmmm" she moaned softly again. She felt a soft and steady rhythm as his fingers stroked...caressed her...</p> <p>As it was he was not moving. A slight movement of his body and his hand that felt...sensual...and sensual as he stroked against her.</p> <p>"mmmmmm" as they turned closer together...to feel and to hold each other. As their lips touched. Their breathing quickening.</p> <p>Their hands caressing and caressing. Their fingers stroking against each other...</p> <p>"ooooohhhh" they moaned softly...as their bodies moved against each other, their hearts beating fast...their hands touching...</p> <p>"ohhhhh" as they reached out for each other...to feel...their hands touching themselves...</p> <p>...as their lips were close together...to taste each other. Their lips felt...them together. Their hands stroking. Their mouths tasting...their tongues tasting. Their lips opening and their tongues touching. Their hands caressing. Their hips moving. Their bodies pressed against each other...</p> <p>"ohhhhhhh" the breathy moans from the passion filled room could be heard for a moment...as his hand moved to her...as his body pressed hers up against hers. As they continued kissing...as she turned slightly to kiss him...he kissed her lips and her lips...as she moved her body against him...</p> <p>...as her hands were now moving under him...around his body. Running their fingers over each others bodies. They moaned in unison as their hands caressed...and felt. As they kissed they touched and touched themselves in ways that excited and excited each other. Their bodies pressing against one another...as their mouths found and kissed.</p> <p>"OH GOD!" He moaned, as his hand moved down her neck...to her breast. Caressing and caressing...caressing as his lips felt her breast...caressing as his lips felt her nipple...caressing as he took his hand and touched...them against his body.</p> <p>They heard his voice with their lips pressed against his ear...moans...her moans...his moans...his pants were moving against her body. Moving her body against him. Their bodies against one another.</p> <p>"OH YES! YES!!...FUCK ME!" she moaned again. "OH GOD YES!"</p> <p>His fingers moved again to her other breast...touching, caressing. Caressing her nipple...softly playing with a little of it.</p> <p>"OHHHHH FUCK!! YES!!"</p> <p>As he continued his hand working over her body her moans of pleasure continued. As he stroked himself...with and with her breast...touching...his hand moved between then...caressing her pussy...as she moaned again.</p> <p>"Oh yes! Oh yes!
