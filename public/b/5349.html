Besides, I know you'll get this job when you have something to show off, but you are my favorite customer I have."</p> <p>"You know I'm your favorite customer." I say with a wink and a smile.</p> <p>"Well, I think so."</p> <p>"What did we just do? Just because I got my pussy fucked like a total whore and let you suck me off at my house, instead of going out to pick up your next customer?" I say, rubbing my neck.</p> <p>"I guess that would be a little different," he says with a huge grin. I'm still laying there getting fucked by you, and loving every second of it. I can't believe that it took this many years to become Mr. Smith.</p> <p>"So, where did you get the job?" I say as we finally stop having sex. "Why are you still here?"</p> <p>"To be with you, my dear."</p> <p>"No! I'm not going to fuck you again, I just want a chance to say goodbye!

And when the time was right, you were going to say something like 'thank you for helping me out this time'. So, you're off limits tonight. You just have to ask me when we're done fucking. And by the way, I never mentioned being with a customer in my past. I can't imagine what would have happened if I would had wanted to fuck a customer tonight."</p> <p>"Please. I'm sorry."</p> <p>"No," he says as he laughs. "I'm no longer worried about your pleasure tonight. I just want to go back to your house, so we can fuck for a while, and then fuck some more. We can have another drink, or watch a movie, or just talk about what has been going on and enjoy the time we have until we get up from here." He rolls over and pulls me on top of him. "Honey, you're going to have three more customersâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
