When I'm ready, I'll let you know."</p> <p>"I can't imagine," she said, feeling flattered at my compliment. I walked behind her and put my hand on the small of her back, pressing it up firmly against her. "Let me know when you're ready and I'll get you ready." With that, I leaned in and kissed her ear. She shivered at my touch, and turned to kiss me. I leaned back against her, as she was on her back, my arm wrapped around her waist, and I ran my hand up her side and over one of her beautiful boobs. She turned her head a tiny bit to the side, inviting me to put my lips there. I kissed my way to the top of her chest, and then continued up, sucking her left nipple into my mouth and kissing up the center of her chest to her other breast.</p> <p>When I got to her tits, I kissed them both and lightly grazed my lips across her areolas. I gently bit her nipples, making her gasp for a moment. I moved over to the other one, and she let out a little squeal, followed quickly by a moan.</p> <p>I leaned down and kissed her belly, and moved towards her right side. "Are you ready?" I asked, but she just nodded her head vigorously. I gently worked my hand down and over her mound, making her arch her body toward me. "No," she told me firmly. "I don't give them up for you." She looked at me, waiting for me to tell her what to do. "Don't you dare stop what you've been doing." I kissed her belly again, and continued down to her pussy. "No, no," she said, "I'm not ready."</p> <p>"OK, but I don't want you to change your mind. Do you want me?"</p> <p>She nodded her head. "All the way."</p> <p>I kissed her right side and then her left, making her shudder with anticipation. I kissed her right breast again, and then put my middle finger in her pussy, moving it gently back and forth over her clit. She moaned at my touch, the movement making her nipple stiffen. I moved my fingers over her clit and pushed them deep inside her at the same time. She let out a little moan and bucked her body against my hand. I stopped teasing her nipple and leaned down. I took both of her nipples in my mouth, one after another, gently chewing on them, and flicked my tongue over them, making her arch her back at my touch. I put both hands on her chest, and slowly let her pussy get the attention it was meant to be receiving. It took almost no time to make her wet. The wetness grew from her pussy, making her clit stand out. I reached up to it, running my finger over it.</p> <p>As I continued moving over her breasts, I kissed down between her legs, and moved away. "No," she cried out. I took a deep breath, and turned her head to her left. "Don't stop where you're at. Don't make me wait."</p> <p>I kissed my way down to her cunt, and got on my knees between her legs. I pulled her body to me so that she was sitting down, and I looked up at her pussy, which was hanging slightly over her. "Don't you dare make me wait," she whispered. "Just do it, and come on."</p> <p>I slowly moved forward, placing my mouth over her pussy. I kissed her deeply, my lips softly touching down over her. As our tongues met, I felt her hands on my hair, holding me back so she could see what I was doing, so she could enjoy herself. My hands kept her at the edge of her seat, until my body pressed forward a few inches. I let my tongue work against her while I pulled and sucked on her clit a little, making her moan. When I finally let her body slide off the seat and roll it back toward her, I moved on top of her. I didn't have to say anything, because she immediately got on top of me. I spread her legs, holding them firmly with my knee. I bent them at the knees, and pulled them up until her pussy was pressing against my cock. I pressed it forward, feeling its weight and hardness as it disappeared deep inside her.</p> <p>"OK, there's one more thing to do before I make love to you," I said, kissing down her neck, taking a nipple between my lips and sucking it hard and pulling on it. She sighed, which felt amazing. I felt her hands on my stomach, pulling on me as she felt my cock sliding into her. It never stopped until it was completely inside. I could feel the muscles of her pussy contract around myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
