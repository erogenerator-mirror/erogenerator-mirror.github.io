"And now, we're not just friends: you're mine now, you know. No, we're lovers. And if you can still be friends with that lovely tongue of yours..."</p> <p>I'm not sure if I was enjoying this, although I do think I loved every second. "God, I like your tongue in my ear, too."</p> <p>"Me too, love," he said, and before I could reply, went upstairs to put on the clothes he'd tossed down and join the others. "Do you want to go for a walk?" I asked, standing up for a while and then, taking his hand, we headed back downstairs. "We should probably dress up a bit," I mused. "And I am so hot for that gorgeous cock-sucking mouth that I should be naked right now."</p> <p>"Not at all," he said. It sounds like you got off on it."</p> <p>"Yeah, but I didn't. It was fun. It felt like I had an audience."</p> <p>"It was like watching a porn movie," he said, turning my body facing him, leaning me back against the bar with him leaning down and kissing me. "That was nice."</p> <p>"Just let your hair down and your legs open for me in, like, the living room, that is. The girls are going to get jealous if they do," I teased, feeling very sexy being so close to him. "Hmmm...I'll take that as a 'yes,' then, hun?"</p> <p>"Mmm-hmm! I'd love to," he murmured.</p> <p>We stopped kissing and turned for the bedroom as he held my hips, pressing himself between them. His cock head had a hard ridge running from his cock-head all the way to his belly. "I think this is fun, too," I murmured to him as he pulled me onto his lap, his hand reaching up under my shirt to hold my breast in his hand again.</p> <p>He rolled me onto my back, lifting my shirt up and over my breasts, his mouth finding one of my pink nipples. It was already hard, and his hardening cock began pressing against my pubic mound, pressing up as he began sucking and licking. I was already wet, just thinking about him in me – my own fingers working their way around the lips of my pussy, finding my clit.</p> <p>My hips were already moving in sync with his kisses, and we made love in the dark of the dark of the bedroom, on the floor of the living room. His fingers still working on my nipple while his tongue slid up and down between my lips and flicked them back and forth as I opened them for him. The feeling of his hot mouth on my pussy excited me even more.</p> <p>"I want you to make love to me while the guys watch," I said in a whisper as he held my hips tightly with one hand, driving his cock as far as it would go into me while the other hand fondled my other breast, pinching and pulling down the nub of my nipple as his lips pulled away from my tits. I was so hot to him while we were there: so hot that I could already feel how much I wanted it. He slid my panties off.</p> <p>That was all I thought about as I felt his cock enter me. As he entered me, the sensation almost made me come. He paused there, letting me get used to the feel of him deep inside of me before he began a slow, easy in and out movement. His hand held onto my hip while he lifted me up and then back down again, his cock head teasing my pussy as his hand held mine. The tempo of his thrusts increased as my body began to sway with it. With the way he carried me in that way, the feeling of him moving up into me, was almost as exciting as the feel of his cock inside of me – even better, knowing that I would soon be moaning for him as I came in the same way when we came at the same time.</p> <p>I held onto him, letting him hold me as we came, and then felt his cock throbbing inside of me and his cum jetting into me as the end of his penis pushed against my g-spot as he came in me.</p> <p>"Oh, God, it was so nice!" I said as he held me tight against him and stroked my breasts with his other hand. "It felt like I had fireworks coming up as you came in me – even more so than you did at the beach.</p> <p>"That was nice, too, love," he murmured, and as he spoke, his cock softened, almost withdrawing from my pussy just a bit.
