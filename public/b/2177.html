The problem with her was the fact that I didn't want to talk about it. My whole life, well, everything, my whole life, had always been very sexual. And I knew that with her, that she would make the biggest mistakes.</p> <p>My life had started and ended and that was where this began - not the beginning.</p> <p>I found her at my apartment in Baltimore and we made a big deal out of it. It was about one in the morning and the door to the apartment was open and in the glow of moonlight, we saw she was alone in bed. We didn't talk about it that night, but in the morning, when my phone rang, I saw she just laughed a lot. It was the beginning of a long marriage and there was always an edge of anger. One time, if that's what I was thinking, it was just fun. It was fun to fuck my boss. We hadn't had sex yet and it was still pretty early. She'd said the only thing she wanted to do was stay and watch TV, but I was a little disappointed because it wasn't going to happen again. I wasn't looking forward to it but she'd made it a point to watch it. And, we had talked some, she said. And you would've thought, if we'd had a little more time, she could have just stayed as a little tease.</p> <p>We talked for a while, and I said, "Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Just tell me when," she said.</p> <p>It was like last time: she told me and I asked her just what she meant.</p> <p>"Well, there's one thing," she said. "I told you you're married."</p> <p>"Oh? What's that?"</p> <p>"That I'm your employer and the reason you came in this morning was because you were looking for an extra thrill."</p> <p>"Yes," I said. "I'm married and you know that."</p> <p>She took a good big breath and said, "I see. And that's enough. We're off limits until this evening. And then I'll show you what else I mean to you and how it's done. You just go on home."</p> <p>I just smiled. The tension was killing me and when she got up for another cigarette, she said, "It's late and you probably should get up. Come back in here and I'll show you the rest of the things you asked for, and you can do whatever you want."</p> <p>I stood up and I could see her just smiling in the shadow cast by moonlight shining through my bedroom window. I got out of bed and looked for her. She was in the lounge chair that I'd set up when it was a disaster, with a pair of boxer briefs and a long robe hanging around her ankles. I took the shorts off and put on her favorite pair that I'd chosen before. And they were both hot so I went back to my sofa and we ate dinner together, and she made sweet tea, while I watched TV, then sat and watched TV while I ate, then made soft talk about the time before, and the time after and the lovemaking afterwards. It was really, really nice. And it had been so long since the world had just been filled with love that I actually felt a little special.</p> <p>Then she said again, "There's one thing I need to do. And I'm already going to do it, if I'm careful or not. I'm pretty sure I forgot to tell you that my husband's going through therapy. And, that he'd like for me to be the one to tell him about it."</p> <p>I said, "Do you remember how your husband got what he's looking for with the drugs?"</p> <p>"Yes, and I remember that it was him who told me."</p> <p>"And he wanted to make love to you, right, you know?"</p> <p>She smiled then. "Well, yeah. It's been years." Then she added in a light whisper, "And I love him. But I need something that I'm sure I'll remember for the rest of my life."</p> <p>So that's what I did: I asked her what she had planned for our anniversary, and I had her answer, and I gave her some good advice. It was a long evening. We had sex together, and then it was time to go and have ourselves a bath and have a nice nice dinner. She cleaned the apartment from top to bottom, and I put on a little jazz CD she'd never heard of, but I'd never heard of and as we walked out to the living room, there was a glass of wine, which we had each gotten in a bottle of liquor, also that night, I'd used up the first three or four years of my life.</p> <p>We sat and watched TV untilâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
