The most attractive woman in the business was beautiful enough to get that kind of attention, especially when she was very young. Now, though, there was nothing really about her that appealed to me. Sure, she had a great body, an almost flat chest and firm, yet shapely young breasts would probably take a hit on any man's hand, and her little bush of black hair, or perhaps even her cute little titties, were just all about you, but now there was something about her.</p> <p>"Is it okay if I go into the dressing room and start the hot shower?" She asked.</p> <p>"Sure," I replied, "I'd really be glad to help you." I offered with a smile. "You can start by washing your hair," My voice was still firm and business like.</p> <p>"I don't mind a bit of the usual, even if it's not exactly necessary!" She said, looking a bit unsure of herself.</p> <p>I smiled. "No, it's okay. And if it feels weird, just come straight to the point. You can always ask, I just thought you might enjoy it a bit more if there wasn't too much of a barrier to break through."</p> <p>"Sure thing." She nodded. It turned out that I liked a bit of the same things so much I had to keep a couple of dozen of our clients away from me. It might help, but right now I was working my way up between the beds and, while at one point, I had just been thinking it wasn't so bad.</p> <p>I put the wet washcloth to my face. Yes, it was really just the sort of thing that was really fun to wash if it was something your wife would appreciate. I was about to wash my hair when the door opened and in walked an older woman. She was wearing sweatpants with a big t-shirt and a light weight baggy t-shirt over her baggy shorts and the usual baggy clothing I like to wear when I travel. Her dark hair was pulled back into a pony tail. She was probably fifty or so and she was wearing a small light weight baggy pair of shorts which would go well with her baggy shirt.</p> <p>"I'm Amanda Stone," she said in a cheerful voice. "I was with some of my clients and I have some nice things to talk to you about," she added with a wink. I don't know why I felt so comfortable talking to a person, but I had not felt it in a while. I wondered, then, which one of my clients Amanda might be. Probably, I could guess.</p> <p>"Hi. I am Jason, and I am here to get you started," she said. I noticed that her hand was slightly shaking.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I smiled.</p> <p>"Of course," she replied. "I haven't been with a client in decades and don't think I'll be this busy. But I have just had some fun, and if someone's getting you the usual time-out, I would appreciate it if you just let them know."</p> <p>As she talked to Amanda, the woman was putting her finger under my chin, lifting my face up. "Jason," she said, "let's get you out of those sweaty clothes first." To my surprise I saw her fingers move across the top of my boxers to the waistband and then pull them down. When they got to those knees, Amanda's hand was on mine and she pulled the tip of my cock out of the hole. I could feel her fingers sliding over my erection as she pulled my boxers up, and at the same time was feeling it in the warm water, against my leg.</p> <p>When my boxers had cleared my erection, Amanda lifted my arms up to get the top off, and I stood there as the older woman reached up and caressed and kneaded my arms and hands.</p> <p>"Now, you are more comfortable." Amanda smiled at me. "But we have to finish your hair before you start getting dressed for the day."</p> <p>"I'd really be happy to help," I said, as my hands went through hers again. She took my hands in hers and put them on my shoulders, moving slowly her hands down my arms to the top of my shirt, slipping her hands underneath to caress and lift it. Then, as she pulled my shirt upwards over my shoulders, she leaned forward, kissing me with her body heat, and taking my hands in hers once again, putting them back on my shoulders, pressing me towards her with her pelvis as her arms went down to my shoulders, and I watched as she pulled my shirt up and over my head. Her eyes locked on my eyes as she raised her hands up to the top of my shoulders, and then she let go and my shirt slidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
