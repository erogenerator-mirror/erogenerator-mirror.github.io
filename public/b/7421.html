I thought it would be good to give him more than a soft, lingering kiss. The more turned on he became, the more likely he would be into kissing me. My mind whirled.</p> <p>"It has been awhile, hasn't it," I finally said.</p> <p>"Sure," he replied, "I've been here almost a day. That would be about the longest of my life."</p> <p>"Let's continue the conversation then?" I smiled. If he was going to continue our conversation, I would have him.</p> <p>"I wouldn't say I want to," he replied. "I really do now. I just want to make love to you. I have always wanted to do that." He pulled me into his arms. He had finally admitted that his wife had been unfaithful to him. "Is the fact that we are on a very rare island this year that you really want to do this for me?"</p> <p>I thought I caught his mind as he asked this. His eyes were focused on just the tip of my erect nipple. "I, um, I don't see anything wrong with this," I stammered, "or I don't really know if I can go this long without sex, and this will probably be the last time I get to do this," I quickly added.</p> <p>I stood up and turned to him. I was so turned on that I am sure his cock could be seen clearly through his slacks. I walked to him with the same enthusiasm he was exhibiting. His cock swelled to an erection. I moved into the next room. I stopped and turned to face him, standing on his left side, slightly away from him, his left hand still on my shoulder, both of us facing him. I took each arm and led him over to the bed.</p> <p>On the bed, I laid him down next to me, then kissed him. Taking his right hand, I took his left hand and put them on one of my breasts. I pushed them together. As I was doing this, he began to trace the outlines of my nipple with his tongue. I moaned and pressed forward into his mouth. I felt his left hand running up and down my leg. I leaned on my right leg, raising it and placing my feet on his shoulders. I felt his hand between my leg and the bed, slowly moving up towards my pussy. I felt his finger on my pussy lips, lightly rubbing against and inside of my lips.</p> <p>With my legs still open to him, I gently pulled him toward me. He was on my left side, his one hand between my legs, running up and down my crotch. I could feel his chest on my left hip. I felt his fingers run lightly across my pussy lips. As he ran his finger across my outer lips, I felt his thumb gently running over my clitoris bringing me to an intense orgasm. I felt the moisture begin to run on my lips and down over his fingers. He stopped for a second and looked me in the eye and I could see the passion in his blue eyes. As he removed his hands from my pussy, I felt him move down from my breast. I realized that he was taking off his clothes.</p> <p>I lay next to him and he reached over and pulled me up on top of him, lying down with my body over his. I took his erect cock in my hands. I could feel the pre-cum on the tip of his cock. I placed the tip at my entrance. I could almost feel it, but a little more.</p> <p>"I think this is what comes of this," I joked. It wasn't enough to push me over the edge into a climax, but the thought of what I was about to do excited me more. I slowly slid down, enveloping his cock in my pussy. We let our lovemaking continue over about 30 seconds before I felt him start to swell. He came in me. It was the most intense cum I had ever taken.</p> <p>I felt him move as I sat up. He looked me in the eye as he started to move again. "Is this what you wanted?" I could feel my clit starting hardening as he started to move. "Yes," I replied in a low voice, "It is."</p> <p>He lifted my legs up and held them tight to his body. I could feel the pulsing of his cock as it slid in and out of me. There were no words, only his voice. As the moment of passion passed, I began to move my hips. I felt his cock, now slick with our fluids, move in and out of me. I could hardly move with him. The feeling was indescribable. I felt the waves of pleasure that were now growing to a point that I wasn't prepared for. I could feel myself getting weakâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
