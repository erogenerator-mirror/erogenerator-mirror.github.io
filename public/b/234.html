He kissed her soft forehead.</p> <p>His heart was beating wildly in his chest and his heart was pounding in his ears. She looked up at him with the prettiest blue eyes that he'd ever seen and he knew he was going to have a big day today.</p> <p>"You have the most beautiful eyes," he told her.</p> <p>"Am I too pretty to have blue eyes?" she asked, with a teasing look in her eye.</p> <p>"I guess most girls have the natural shade of blue," he replied, as he watched her take off her robe and hang it on the frame in the kitchen.</p> <p>Her body glowed like a light as she smiled. Her firm tits looked beautiful, even in the cold. The nipples were so sensitive and they stood proudly erect. She had dark brown shoulder length hair and her skin shone like white gold. She made her way to the refrigerator and turned around to show him what he had to offer.</p> <p>"Do you think there are any other options for a little fun today?" she asked him.</p> <p>"There are two options, I think I know one that better," he said with a big smile.</p> <p>"Good choice," she said as she walked to the refrigerator and opened the door.</p> <p>Just after leaving the kitchen, she came back to the table. She took a bite of some of the delicious pasta his mother had made and spread it around her waiting mouth. Her mouth was so plump and her skin so creamy it looked like butter at the edges. It was so tender to the touch and she knew that no woman would ever be able to withstand the attention that it was generating in her.</p> <p>"How do you feel about this?" she asked him.</p> <p>"I'm in a committed relationship and I'm glad today is this special day I've had here for the past three months," he told her, trying to keep his smile from showing on his face.</p> <p>"I'm a married woman, so it's not so different," she told him.</p> <p>After placing down the pasta, he moved in beside her on the couch, so that he could lay his head on her shoulder.</p> <p>"You feel so warm," he told her.</p> <p>"It's true," she said. "I feel all tingly down here."</p> <p>"Don't you need a little help?" he asked, kissing her head.</p> <p>At that moment, she turned and laid eyes on his manhood resting against his stomach. She took it in her hand, and smiled with happiness.</p> <p>"Merry Christmas, Tom," she said.</p> <p>As they lay together, they looked at each other and she knew he was in paradise on Christmas day.</p> <p>"I just love the way you look on Christmas Eve, and how sweet you look when you are here," she told him.</p> <p>"It's Christmas and you know it," he smiled. "Can't you come here again?"</p> <p>"Oh, no. I've wanted to do that for three months and tonight."</p> <p>As he lay on the couch, her leg touched his naked hip and they looked into each others eyes. He wanted to move up and be closer to her, but he wasn't sure he was ready for that. After thinking it over for a moment, the he broke their eye contact and asked her.</p> <p>"Do you need any more?" he asked her and she nodded.</p> <p>"I want to get back to my room with you," he told her.</p> <p>"I know you will; and I am so excited," she said as she gave him a light squeeze.</p> <p>"This was wonderful," he said as he rested his head on her shoulder.</p> <p>It was only about an hour later that they were talking about all the things that had happened since they had met.</p> <p>"Is there any way that I could get in touch with you again?" he suggested, in his best man's way of saying he wanted to find out if there was any place on earth to go on Christmas Eve.</p> <p>"I'm glad that you would do that for me," she told him. "I can't thank you enough for all you have done."</p> <p>"Well, there's one way you can thank me," he said. "This will be much more than just an errand I could do at home if the opportunity arose."</p> <p>"Okay, you won't regret this," she told him and he could tell she was joking. "Let me go inside again, and I will see you tomorrow," she told him, as she stood up and left him on the couch.</p> <p>As she left the kitchen, she took some warm, wet kisses on the lips.</p> <p>As she was walking to the door, she caught him in the hallway.
