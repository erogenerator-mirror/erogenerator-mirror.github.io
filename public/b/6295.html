"Please... don't stop... I'm... close..."</p> <p>"Oh, but don't you dare cum."</p> <p>"But... but... why... how... I mean... is this... making me... crazy..." I felt like a little boy playing a game on his first date. It had never happened before. It was exciting in a very scary way.</p> <p>"It's just something that I love to do. It's my favorite thing to do... do... with a woman... to get her to let me..."</p> <p>I'm not sure... but it felt like the best thing I ever said to her.</p> <p>"Oh... please don't stop... I'll do whatever you want... until... until you're satisfied..."</p> <p>I felt as if he could read my mind, but instead said 'this isn't true...'</p> <p>It felt as if he knew exactly what I was saying. After a bit, I stopped saying 'this isn't true'.</p> <p>"Don't you dare cum."</p> <p>She had me do it again.</p> <p>"How... do you... like to... cum?"</p> <p>"It's... um... it's... I... I don't know... but... it's..."</p> <p>"Oh... ok."</p> <p>She gently pushed my back. I was scared, but my whole body seemed to know instinctively what to do to please her. "How's it feel?"</p> <p>"... okay..." I could feel my body trying to move. I couldn't help it. I could feel the warmth spreading into my belly. She pushed my head down, "now... I want to please you..."</p> <p>I was in my mid-thirties.</p> <p>"You like that... don't you?"</p> <p>"Yeah... sure... but... it's... going... to... go... really... slow..."</p> <p>She kept stroking my cock through my pants, making me dizzy. "Just hold it a moment."</p> <p>After a long, slow movement, she put her finger around the opening inside my thong, and dragged it down. I tried to push my hips up and make her go faster.</p> <p>Then, her other hand had me lift up. "I want to take this off"</p> <p>"Yes... ok..."</p> <p>"No... I want... to... look... at... what you're... doing... so... don't cum on me." Again, she removed my thong. I couldn't hold out any longer. I pulled my hips up, my hands pulling my legs up further, and grabbed her hips. I tried to push my pelvis hard in her hand.</p> <p>"Oh..." she moaned loud.</p> <p>"You want me to... take.. off?" I was barely above normal speech, but it sounded like "I want you to push me down... so... harder."</p> <p>She nodded her head as if I'd said something, while continuing the slow strokes. Soon she had her thong completely off, and she pressed her hands on the couch. Her wet pussy was completely on full display underneath her neatly trimmed pubic hair. She pushed my head down. "Yes... oh, it's so... thick..."</p> <p>This time, she pulled it up, and put it on her crotch. I opened my eyes and saw her waiting, smiling at me. "Is... this... going too far..."</p> <p>"... I want... to... make... your... panties..."</p> <p>"Oh," she responded, "don't... stop... if I... like... it." She seemed excited now. In a few seconds, my cock was rock hard. "Do you like me... taking off... my... panties?" she asked with a slight southern accent.</p> <p>"Yes..."</p> <p>"Do... you... like... to.... fuck me?"</p> <p>"I... don't know," I replied.</p> <p>"It's your choice," she said in a sweet voice.</p> <p>"You don't... know...?"</p> <p>"It's alright," she said, "I want your cock to... show... me everything... and... give me..."</p> <p>"I think..."</p> <p>I felt like she had to be able to read my mind. She reached over to my waist and took it off too. With little hesitation she put her hands into my belly and pushed them upwards. I was trying to get them under the waistline on my pants, but she stopped me.</p> <p>"No... not that."</p> <p>"Do... you... want... to... make me wear a dress?" I asked in an embarrassed voice.</p> <p>"Yes... I want... to show... youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
