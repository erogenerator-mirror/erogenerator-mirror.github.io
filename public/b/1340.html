I said as I set out the trays, and after they had their breakfast things were back into order.</p> <p>"What about a walk or walk around the beach?" she questioned with a hopeful smile.</p> <p>"The beach would be great but it's a great location, it's more of a natural location," I told her.</p> <p>"I like that!" She exclaimed, "Maybe we can go for a walk in the water!"</p> <p>"I'll walk in the water for you," I smiled trying to be as polite as possible, "Just watch me, don't tell me you don't want to!"</p> <p>She just smiled and looked thoughtful, as if she didn't know why I was asking anyway, "You better take me for a walk or something, ok!" she told me.</p> <p>So I agreed. We stood up and stretched our legs, "Maybe I should get us a couple of chairs while my feet have a rest before we go swim!" she said.</p> <p>At the beach I picked my bag up and started to load up. I found a secluded spot. I could hear the ocean waves crashing in the sand. She sat on one of the chairs and I sat on the chair, the wind blowing over us, I could see the ocean through the open window of the nearby house.</p> <p>"So what would you like to do now?" she asked me as she picked up her sunglasses, her eyes lit up.</p> <p>"My feet are fine, I'm really in good shape, if we walk it would be nice," I told her.</p> <p>"I agree, lets go jump in the water." She said.</p> <p>I reached over my back and started to move a few sand and towels down to the bottom of the water off the ocean. We went at it for quite some time. She seemed to enjoy it.</p> <p>"Let's do it, we can do it again soon!" she said.</p> <p>We took a bit of time walking back but our feet were getting tired, I took the opportunity to sit on a beach, "If you two agree, I'll jump in the water, if you want to swim, you can climb on over me."</p> <p>"Ok!" she said eagerly, "we can swim under the water, if you want," she said as she lay her sunglasses over her eyes. She was right on the brink of an orgasm, her feet were beginning to tire, she really seemed to like the ocean air as it washed over her.</p> <p>I climbed out of the water, and she took off her shoes as I began to get out of the water, and we slowly walked toward the water. "You know," I said, "I think we should sit down under the water to take a breather."</p> <p>She sat down on the chair next to me, she looked at me with a mischievous grin, her legs spread slightly, I could see her inner thighs wet and shiny. She had her leg between mine, we had a conversation that started pretty warmly. This seemed to have the effect of loosening her up a bit. She leaned forward and kissed me softly and we started to kiss. She continued to kiss me lightly as my penis began to harden, our mouths were still close and our tongues were dancing with each other.</p> <p>My penis was very hard and sticking up straight as I kissed her all over her face and neck and she pulled me closer into her. I slowly undid her top freeing her small breasts. As I lifted her top and threw it at her, her beautiful breasts popped out, and I took one of her breasts in my hand and began to caress it, as her other hand went to the back of my head holding me tight to her breast.</p> <p>"This is so beautiful," she said as I kissed her breasts gently. She ran both of her fingers over my cheek, and as I began to massage and kiss all over her chest, and then as I massaged and kissed her other breast slowly working down over her other breast and neck, over her shoulder and down her back to her butt. I worked some of her pubic hairs and then kissed all down her back to a place to start kissing her butt crack as I moved my hand back up over her pussy lips rubbing her outer lips.</p> <p>"That is where I want your penis before we jump into the water," she said as I slowly moved away from her and slowly kissed my way up her legs, stopping briefly at her ass crack. As I reached her pussy lips, she moaned as she felt my lips touch her lips. I ran my tongue slowly around the tip of her vagina, as she let out moans which filled the air. I began to lick the outside of herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
