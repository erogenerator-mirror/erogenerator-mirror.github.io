He smiled and pulled the covers back on the small bed.</p> <p>"There are candles out in the living room, why don't you go get us a glass of juice," he said.</p> <p>As she got into the bed and threw on the sheet again, he came and laid back, and was soon spooning her. She could smell the musky scent of his cock on her skin which made her skin crawl. He was so hard and tall that it was making her pussy hurt a little. Her ass was on fire and her nipple felt like a baseball batter, it strained hard in the air like a little soldier.</p> <p>"Let's see you eat some pussy," he teased her as he got out of bed.</p> <p>Her mouth dried up from her body and pussy, she smiled and looked at the clock. The minute seemed just moments away and she wanted to run and get an extra piece of her clothing and run a quick errand. As she got up off the bed, he walked over to get dressed. He bent down to get his underwear and she got up, too, and they quickly ran to the bathroom. She took his underwear out of her small hand that he held up and pulled them up, looking at them in wonder. They looked so sexy. She wanted to fuck him just the way she had wanted to fuck him. He put his shirt on and she looked at his panties, and they were soaked with his cum. She put them in her handbag and went back in the bathroom to get her clothes.</p> <p>"I'm going to go change. I'll join you then," he said, smiling at her. She looked at him, and then went back into the room. Her face still flushed and she was breathing hard as she walked out of the bedroom.</p> <p>"You looked so hot last night," he said to her.</p> <p>"You were so handsome," she said turning herself around and walking up the hallway. She went into the bathroom and ran the water. She turned off all the lights except the ones that were in her bathroom.</p> <p>"How do you want to do this? Do you want to make love to me tonight or the next day?" she asked her reflection in the bathroom mirror.</p> <p>She heard the water and came back, wrapped herself around her lover, wrapping her arms tightly around his large strong torso and pulling herself tighter against the young man she had loved for years. Feeling herself tighten, she looked up at her reflection and couldn't believe she was watching herself in the mirror. She pulled and pulled and could feel the wetness on the front of her thong as she got herself aroused, her hips rocked up and down involuntarily.</p> <p>"Oh baby I want to make love in this bathroom," she whispered.</p> <p>She walked to room 828 and looked at the bed still empty. The curtains hung down on the back. She walked to it, picked up her small purse and slipped it in the inside pocket, and smiled, still turned on at her situation. She closed the door gently.</p> <p>"What are you still wearing," he asked.</p> <p>"Just my panties and blouse."</p> <p>"What for?" she asked a little nervously.</p> <p>"Come here."</p> <p>She walked over to him and felt his hardness. She got on her knees and looked down at him. She felt his eyes caressed and then her small hand wrapped around his thick cock.</p> <p>"Is that better?" she ask him.</p> <p>"You are so beautiful and I've always wanted you," he whispered and looked so deep into her eyes and into her soul. "I love you," he said.</p> <p>"Oh baby, you're so full of it," she purred.</p> <p>His hand caressed her face. She reached up and put her hand on his chest to feel his manhood.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful baby," he told her.</p> <p>"We need to go now," she whispered, and began to kiss him and run her hand over his chest.</p> <p>He reached up and put one of her breasts in his mouth and sucked hard on her nipple. She let out a small moan. He loved how she got so wet and turned on when she got that turned on.
