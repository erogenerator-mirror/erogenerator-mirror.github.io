I could feel my pussy begin to tingle at the thought of what she was going to do - what she would make me do. I was just about out of my mind right now, just wanting her badly, and when I saw her nipples hardening in response to her gentle touch, I knew she would be able to feel too. "Ohhh, that feels so good," I murmured, almost gasping for breath. She leaned in and flicked my nipple sharply with her tongue, making me gasp at the pleasure of it. When her tongue was done, she ran her tongue down my chest to my neck and then slowly across my chest, back up to my neck - making me gasp again as I felt her tongue touch my skin. Just as I felt myself getting to the point of no return, she bit down on my neck lightly and my entire body went rigid. I screamed, arching my back as she bit me so beautifully, drawing blood - and for the first time in years, I knew what her tongue was doing to me. I could feel my pussy leaking hot liquid all over her tongue as it ran down my chest. I knew the feeling would never cease even after I stopped squirming. It was incredible.</p> <p>Her wet tongue, now moving quickly across my collarbone, reached across my chest and began to slip lower, tracing the crevasse of my breastbone, circling my nipple as she did. I shuddered in anticipation when her lips closed on the sensitive head of my nipple and she softly sucked it into her mouth, licking it like a lollipop. The intensity of the sensations from her tongue down there was too much to hold myself upright. She drew her mouth away from me, leaving only my nipple. "Oh, God," I moaned as she began to flick my nipple back and forth with the point of her tongue, feeling her saliva coat my nipple perfectly, adding its color to her face as she did.</p> <p>"You taste so good," she said as her tongue lightly flicked my nipple. It sent shivers down my spine, causing my knees to tremble. "Mmmm - yes, like that - I love it," she purred, her voice husky and low, almost like the purr of a kitten.</p> <p>She traced her fingertips over my chest, running them down my belly before she took my nipple between her thumbs and forefingers, gently squeezing and pulling. I felt myself shuddering in response. Her thumb and forefinger started to circle my nipple in a gentle, circular motion, and I felt like I was on the edge of my next orgasm. She did not wait for me to calm down but continued to lightly stroke the tip of my nipple, letting my skin feel the slight roughness of her fingers. "My turn now," she said, raising herself on the couch and then leaning back toward me a bit, resting her hands on the armrest, her knees bent slightly outward as if she was offering herself to me. I knew what she wanted and knelt behind her, my face now only a foot or so behind her, between her legs. As I took her pussy lip between my lips and gently sucked her, I gently traced my fingers down my chest and hips, down over my stomach and between my legs. I found myself wondering, almost feeling as if someone was touching me as I watched her as her pussy seemed to tighten slightly.</p> <p>"Do you want to come over here now?" she asked, looking over her shoulder at me over her shoulder. "Yes - please - come down here. Now," she said, looking back at me. I knew exactly what she was saying and what she meant, but I also knew that I wanted to do that. I moved over and rested myself behind her, my hands gently cupping her breasts. I ran my hands up and down one, feeling her breath again. I moved one hand down to her clit and began to tease her with my palm.</p> <p>"Ummm - I've been wet from you staring at me, but not from you playing with my nipples," she said as I started to knead one of her breast, making small circular motions with my thumb. "Come on, play with me - I can be your personal plaything for a long time," she whispered, her voice trailing off into a pout. She turned around a bit and reached up to take my hands, pulling me to her as she sat back against the arm of the couch. I watched her hands as they slowly moved down over my torso, over my stomach as they kneaded into my abdomen. I looked down at her face, watching her mouth move asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
