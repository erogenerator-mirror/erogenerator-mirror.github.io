I agreed with him. He had no idea that I was a virgin and didn't know exactly what he'd take me for. As soon as I started getting excited he pushed me to the bed on my back! I just giggled as he knelt between my legs and took his time to lick me, I knew that I'd be wet down there and if I wasn't careful I'd be soaking, this was my first time, I decided to go with the flow.</p> <p>"Now, you can lick the outside," he said.</p> <p>"I don't know, I'm new at oral sex." I smiled.</p> <p>"Well, I'll leave you alone. Just enjoy yourself, you're about to make a virgin." He kissed me, as he moved lower, I felt my cunt come to life, he moved his tongue to my cunt, he started slowly, first licking it and then sucking it, then he stopped and took it in his mouth while the two of us licked the juices from inside.</p> <p>"That's it," I felt him suck my clit until I was on my toes and he pushed my knees up higher, I was now spread wide letting him fuck me with his tongue!</p> <p>"Now," he whispered, he stood up and I heard him unzip his pants. He put my legs over his shoulders, and I felt him press his erect cock against my cunt lips, I was so wet that it slipped in without much problem. "Doesn't it feel good to have somebody enter you, just like in my stories." I felt my cunt open, he was able to enter so easy and deep! "Haaaah," I moaned, "That's it, that's what I wanted." And he fucked me so hard and deep. "Oh, you feel so good in me. I could stay here all day and not fuck you!"</p> <p>He was so hard, it felt huge! "Are you enjoying that?" he cried. "I can feel the cum!"</p> <p>"Yes, I want that!" I moaned into his ear, "I want that cum!"</p> <p>Suddenly he pulled his cock out and I felt a warm liquid hitting my cunt lips, it sent my orgasm into orbit! It kept coming until he stopped rubbing it and shot cum from his cock to my cunt, he continued to stroke it until I collapsed on the bed. My legs fell back and I spread them wide so that it slid in further and further, I didn't want him to stop. I was so excited I could hardly breathe and as my breath came back and forth my whole body was trembling. I felt his wet cock head slip into the top of my swollen cunt lips, he kept slipping in till his cockhead was in up to the balls, then he stopped and we both lay there breathless, he kissed me.</p> <p>"That was amazing. Don't you think you know?" I giggled.</p> <p>"Well, you're welcome." He put his arms around me and hugged me tightly, then he just sat on me. "I had a bad dream, I'm so sorry," he said, "I can't help it. Now just lie still and I'll come in and get you," and he got off the bed to open a beer, I had no idea what he was doing, but as soon as he was gone I knew that this wasn't a dream.</p> <p>"What was your dream?" I asked.</p> <p>"Nothing, nothing." he replied. "I think that we are having one of the most memorable sex dreams of our life!"</p> <p>I laughed. "I can't believe it, I wish it were real, I know that it's not."</p> <p>"Me too!" he said, "but we could be together tonight!"</p> <p>"That would be fantastic!" I said, "and that's what we are going to do again tomorrow night."</p> <p>"I've never felt anything so good before" he said, "I just couldn't believe that we both had the same dreamâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
