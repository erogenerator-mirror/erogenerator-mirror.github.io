The officer asked.</p> <p>"There is," she said.</p> <p>"Yes, ma'am," he said and got into his car and drove off.</p> <p>The next two hours were an endless blur of traffic, high-fives, laughs, and promises of more of those later. She was so wound up that she had to touch herself! When she was finished she just fell to her knees on the gravel of the highway and just listened to all of the words that had been spoken.</p> <p>"Is there a problem, Miss?" She heard the officer say again.</p> <p>"I'm not sure," she said, "It just might be that I'm a bad girl."</p> <p>"You sure, bitch?" The officer asked, laughing.</p> <p>"Yes, officer, I'm not sure."</p> <p>"Is there a problem?" The officer asked again.</p> <p>"She got caught in traffic," she said, "there's a problem!"</p> <p>"Well, it's a cop car you have to go in to. Do you want to come too? I can get you out of here and you can go in back there." He looked at her.</p> <p>"Don't you want to?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, I do!" He said and laughed. "Let's go on back then and see what's going on. I'm in no shape to drive! I can't do it!" He pulled into a parking spot behind the police car, got out and opened her door and she got out behind him. He opened the door for her and they went inside, she started to walk down the hallway to her bedroom.</p> <p>It wasn't long before he pulled her into the bathroom and she started to put on her makeup. She felt like she was going to have a heart attack. She looked in the mirror. Her makeup was heavier than what the officer she was talking to had been wearing, it looked like she was trying to get her fingers to do something that wasn't going to be very easy. She looked at her face in the mirror too, wondering what was wrong with her. "Well, I guess you can try, but at least I have one thing I want to see," the officer said. "Get a good look at that ass," he said.</p> <p>"Thank you, officer, that's quite an ass and I love it," she told him and blushed when she looked at him.</p> <p>He laughed. "Look, this has been a wonderful day, I've got to return the favor," he said. "I'm not asking for anything from you tonight but come back another day for some fun." He turned and went back inside. She was still trying to think of a way to get him out of there but it didn't seem like what she was really after. So she just stood there and cried. Soon she was sobs and tears started to fall and she was afraid that the officer would come. She took the clothes she had picked out and threw them on the floor and started to cry until she had cried herself to sleep that night.</p> <p>Chapter 3 – Afternoon – Back at Home</p> <p>It happened to her, very unexpectedly, the next morning. She was in the mood to take a quick shower, get dressed and then meet him for brunch. She was so happy and happy today. When she walked out of her bedroom and into his doorway she kissed him again. She felt really proud of herself when he told her to walk in him and kissed him. When he pulled away from them, she said, "Okay, I'm ready to go!"</p> <p>Chapter 4 – Lunch – Out of Time</p> <p>They went to the cafeteria and sat down at an open table together when they were all alone. The man he had asked out for lunch was a manager and he was serving lunch on a tray. There was no conversation to be had. She was glad for the lunch break. When she sat down she tried to tell herself that she was just going to go back to being her normal self and relax after everything. She hoped that they would get on and on and that everything would turn out the way she wanted them to.</p> <p>The man, the manager, turned to her. He looked about thirty and looked about as healthy as he could get. If it were possible for his eyes to stay longer than they did, a light bulb went on in his head. She smiled when she saw these brown eyes and a friendly smile.</p> <p>"Hello, Miss," she said and sat down. He was about her age and he was tall, with a nice smile. He had a mustache and mustache around his mouth, which made him look kind of funny.</p> <p>"What can I get my order?" said the man, looking at the tray.</p> <p>"Well, you can get anything that's on the menu and everything you can see," the woman said—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
