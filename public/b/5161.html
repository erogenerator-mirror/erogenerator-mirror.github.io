"I couldn't be mad. You didn't have to go without." He grabbed my arm that was around my waist and held it tight. We walked up to the front porch. The breeze was cool. The door closed behind us. He lifted me effortlessly. He carried me to the house and laid me down on the bed. He lay down on top of me. We lay there for a long, long time.</p> <p>"What do you think I should do about my date with Jennifer."</p> <p>"About what?" I asked.</p> <p>"How will you look her?"</p> <p>"We could go out."</p> <p>"Would you like to go out?"</p> <p>He pulled me to him and laid me down.</p> <p>"Don't you think we should find out where this little lady is headed?" he asked. He kissed me.</p> <p>I turned into him and kissed him. I kissed him like I didn't have sex with any man in twenty years. I wasn't as wild or passionate as Jennifer.</p> <p>"So you want to go out with me."</p> <p>"I need to be with you again."</p> <p>"You want to do this again. Now!"</p> <p>He kissed me again and moved down between my legs. He slid his hand between my legs and touched my pussy. The warmth made me wet. I loved his touch.</p> <p>"Make love to me," he whispered.</p> <p>I felt as if I were in a daze. I looked at him and closed my eyes.</p> <p>"Just like that," he said. He rubbed the folds of my body. I opened my eyes and saw Jennifer standing by the window, watching our family together. Our parents never showed any interest in me, just like I liked them to do. I smiled and said, "Do it baby," my eyes still closed. I opened my eyes and he leaned over me and kissed me softly. He touched my breast. I ran my fingers through his hair as we kissed. He slowly lowered his head, kissing his way down my body. When he was between my legs he pulled me to him. He teased my opening with his tongue. I felt the warmth of his body against me.</p> <p>He reached down and placed his fingers in the folds of my sex. He pushed two inside of me and moved them in small circles. He moved his fingers inside of me as he kissed me. He moved his fingers out and pushed them inside of me again. He moved them in and out, in and out, coating them with my juices. He rubbed his fingers harder on me and I moaned louder. He pressed his fingers against my entrance, his thumb touching my clit and I exploded.</p> <p>He held me inside of him as I recovered and kissed me again. He pulled his body up to his and kissed me with passion again. He kissed at my neck and chest then down to my lips. He lowered me down onto the bed. I felt his weight against me and I closed my eyes. I felt his breath on my lips. He kissed me and I felt his tongue slide into me. I opened my mouth and he tasted of my own moisture. He held my lips with his mouth, his tongue fucking me at the same time. He pushed the tip inside of me again and I came again.</p> <p>He pushed me down, pinning me to the mattress. I felt him against me and felt the thickness of his manhood rubbing against my thigh. I opened my legs even wider to get him inside of me. He pushed inside. He moved up and down against me as we kissed. I felt my body move toward orgasm, but I didn't want it to happen. I felt his hands on my sides. He rubbed my sides as I moved against him. I felt his weight press into me. I knew what he would do next. I felt the head of his cock against my stomach. I opened myself to him. His hot shaft slid through my body. I closed my eyes. I felt it slide home against my stomach. He felt good inside of me. I pushed against him and felt his head move into my body. As he pushed into me I felt his head pushing into my stomach.</p> <p>"Oh god!" I moaned, I felt him begin to move inside of me. I pushed against him, pushing my body into him.</p> <p>"Oh god," I cried as I felt him in me. I felt his hard cock against me. I felt the head moving into my womb. His warmth was filling me completely and he began to move inside of me. I felt the throbbing of his organ as we made loveâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
