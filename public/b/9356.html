How are you feeling? I'm happy.</p> <p>"So I'm going to get drunk tonight at my next friend's party," I said, "and you're going to go off to bed? Are you looking forward to it, and what is it you'd like to talk about? Do you have any particular fantasies you would want to have me tell? Do you have any special fantasies about me I could make you feel uncomfortable with? I don't really like asking these things. It is a very personal thing, I promise. "</p> <p>"I don't really need to know much, I guess," I said, "It's just you and me here. Maybe that's your main fantasy. I would like to talk about some of them with you sometime."</p> <p>"I'd like that. Anything in particular you'd like to know?"</p> <p>"I'd like to know what you're thinking," I answered, "and I wouldn't mind being your friend. I have very strong feelings for being with you that I'm quite happy, and you aren't going to take advantage of me, and if we're going to do this, we need to make it happen."</p> <p>"But I do feel the need to be your friend, and that is a very real possibility. If things go along, we're going to have a great time talking about my fantasies."</p> <p>"I have some other things planned for you, too, and I'll tell you. Here, for that we're going to have another drink. Do you like red?"</p> <p>"Yes, I do." I took a big gulp of my beer, and took another large sip and handed that back. Then I said, "Red, please, have a glass of champagne and a drink, and make sure that you're not going to spill anything on me, I'm not the type of drink to pass up."</p> <p>"Are you sure this is a good idea?" she laughed, "I was not suggesting you should take all the time to take a shower, and you don't have to be in these clothes. I'm sure that you're going to have to go home and shower at home. No peaking in the shower for a bit before you go home, will you?"</p> <p>"No, I'll never peep in the shower before, I promise."</p> <p>She said the magic words to keep us under control. They could be so simple if you are not sure of the answer.</p> <p>Well, you have very nice body, and I love your breasts and areolas." I sat in a chair across from her. I had her sit down and leaned in to kiss her, and she let my tongue run all around her lips and tongue, then she started the kiss again. She had one hand in my lap and the other was under mine, pulling my hand up and rubbing my cock. It was so soft, and I had no problem with that being touched. It was obvious just how hard I was, and she could feel it through the cloth of the shorts I was wearing. I was breathing hard too. "Why did you go away earlier?"</p> <p>"I have some things I want to do, and some things I just can't do, and that I want to do to you. It sounds so romantic, so romantic, but all the time, my fantasy is just us and you."</p> <p>"Do you realize how bad it would be if I were your fantasy? This is your dream right?"</p> <p>"Yes, of course. I'm very real. This is you. You're in my dream. You're beautiful in my dreams." She leaned her head back and said, "Wow, that is going to be hot. You can't do that to me. You don't want to do that."</p> <p>"I love you more than anything, and if you tell me about that fantasy at some point, I'll stop," I answered, getting the hang of a long time ago. There was a long pause and then she said, "And I really like you. I have my own fantasies. But you're going to have to get in touch with me to know where to find me, so if you'd like, I could be at your house in twenty minutes."</p> <p>I said, "Oh, I know where it is. I'd love to meet you, but I don't really think I've got the time. Can we stop there, please?"</p> <p>"I'd like that, but if I get in trouble. I'd like to at least have a drink with you, before we get to the bedroom, if it would help."</p> <p>"You're sure?"</p> <p>"Yes, if you're certain."</p> <p>She got up and kissed me again. "You're a great kisser. You take care of yourself, and get hard. I really like you.
