It had been written from a couple of years before - maybe a while before, maybe even before then, but to be frank and honest with myself there's little to say - for now that would not be all it needs to be, for the next time that the author is a stranger. For right now, I would just go to bed anyway, and hopefully fall asleep quickly. If it was any comfort at all then I would just fall asleep. If she ever did, I will gladly do a lot for her - I will certainly be there for her as a friend too!</p> <p>I was just thinking about her as I was sleeping - how she was in bed with the nightgown on and her head uncovered and her hair spread over the pillow and her naked ass hanging slightly. I would look at the sight of her and wonder if the nightgown ever had come undone and was covering the very top of it with her full breasts - or, if it was a boy that was naked and his penis was very hard at the sight of her. All in the name of all these things I had to think about.</p> <p>I heard her footsteps get louder and went to bed.</p> <p>I dreamt about her, and that's when I became aware of it. There was no alarm going off, only the sound of my sister's bedroom door going wide open, and I turned my head to see what was happening.</p> <p>The door of her bedroom was open. I couldn't see anything, but there she was, sitting on the end of the bed and she was all wide awake and beautiful to even look at. I could see that she had on a new nightie with matching thong. I was not surprised to see it, and I wondered if she had any idea about what she would see.</p> <p>"I told you that the day was coming," she said softly in my ear as she kissed my cheek and then my lips.</p> <p>I was trying not to think, as if I was in a dream world and just could not have imagined anything more wonderful. But as suddenly as her lips pulled mine to me, like a kiss, she did not and I melted with her sweet lips. And I was suddenly very aware that she had pulled her nightie down from her waist - not far, but very deliberately. I could now see that there was nothing more there than her perfect, soft, young body. I didn't feel like I could ever see her hair any longer, not yet, but still I was aware of her. I could see that her pussy was still wet. There was a small trail of hair that was still running down her mound. Her breasts were completely free - I would say that if she were still wearing those nighties, they would still be very sensitive, and I would already be excited, but all of a sudden I was very nervous!</p> <p>At first I simply felt the warm air on my face, feeling a wave of pleasure wash over me and through to my pussy. But as she did not let up kissing me, I could not hold myself back any longer - I wanted her so much I actually felt a bit of pressure in my pelvis, and as I moaned it was her tongue that sent me over the edge. It was that tongue licking my pussy, not my sister's tongue that I loved more and more! And then she was kissing me, feeling for the first time the softness of my lips. It was all so erotic and it would have made my whole body jolt if all I tried was to hold still and let her find things out - and, if she wanted to kiss me some more.</p> <p>I felt that she was kissing me so deeply I could barely hear it. I felt those lips being very gently pulled apart and I felt a little of the bedding that I hadn't noticed when it had been on the floor come falling down to cover us. I felt completely helpless as she gently sat on my bottom. I could feel her body very close to me as she gently eased herself down on me. We kissed deeply and I could feel her breasts crushed tight into my own small soft ones. She moaned with pleasure and I could feel her hips pressing down into my own as her tongue invaded my mouth. I felt her fingers gently pulling and playing with my nipples while we kissed deeper. And I felt her soft, smooth stomach pressing harder into my own.</p> <p>As our kisses grew more passionate, I felt her hands exploring the soft skin at the base of my breasts, and I was now lifting each of my own little twin breasts, feeling the softness and weight and being able to play with the nipples as I pulled and teased them. Her tongue was pressing down into my mouth as I kissed her and our bodies felt each other.</p> <p>Then I felt myself being pulled up from the bed by the neck as she laid down on me.
