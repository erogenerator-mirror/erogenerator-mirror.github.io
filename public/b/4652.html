Her job is to keep an eye on the customers and make sure she stays on top of all their bills. Of course, this made sense now and it meant that she was able to put it into perspective the first time around.</p> <p>It worked out very well with Sophia, as well, thanks to me being here. And that was the one thing I really didn't enjoy about Sophia. I hated every moment that I had spent with her, and that was why I always came home to a room that had a TV, or stereo running, or anything similar. She was a bit more reserved than I, as well as a little wild sometimes, but that was just a turnoff. At least for me, it made sense. But, it never got boring really, I was just happy to be here with my woman.</p> <p>The only downside of the arrangement I had the following week was that, as I was going to work, Sophia had to keep a little bit of work done during breaks, but other than that, she was just going to be working on Saturday. The week after that also gave us a few days alone too. I really didn`t mind, really. There, we could watch a movie, and fool around a bit.</p> <p>We had even had a couple of drinks at one of the bars after work, that Friday night. It had been a very interesting evening, I guess. While we were in the bar, chatting, talking about the previous weekends sex with my wife, we heard the doorbell ring. Then we heard an intense, husky voice. She started to answer the front door when we heard the sultry voice of my wife in the front hallway.</p> <p>"Hey honey. How long has it been?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don`t know. We got home late last night and it took ages till we got into bed!" she said, looking at her watch again, her voice husky and full of anticipation.</p> <p>"It's like this, it could be hours before you come home. Then we had this whole thing taken care of by the fire department..." she laughed and continued her seductive voice.</p> <p>"Yeah. That`s probably true, but I don`t think we should be talking like that... I know it's not for you..." I said, pulling her hand down to my groin, where I could feel it throbbing.</p> <p>Sophia pulled the front door down, locking it, trying to get a good vantage point to watch my wife seduction, not bothering to get dress.</p> <p>She slowly crept in the door, her body language telling me all I needed to know.</p> <p>She slowly unzipped my pants and pulled them down, over my cock, exposing me, all 8 inches of it.</p> <p>Sophia reached forward with both hands and grasped my cock and began to stroke it through my boxers.</p> <p>"I love you, but you know I have a job to do. Come and join me..." she softly whispered, leaning in to kiss me.</p> <p>I didn`t have to be persuaded. As I had asked her before, I slowly pulled down my boxers as I sat up, allowing my long, stiff cock to spring free.</p> <p>I stepped out of my pants and took my shirt off, allowing my now rigid member to stand out proudly between my legs.</p> <p>"Come on in baby. Sit in the chair..." she said, smiling and reaching for me.</p> <p>She pulled me over to the chair and sat her back against the couch, laying back against a pillow that was on the far end of the loveseat.</p> <p>She motioned for me to turn around, taking my cock in her hand and guiding it towards her soaking wet pussy, which was waiting for it.</p> <p>I slid up over her in one fluid motion, finding her already so wet that I slid easily into her as we both moaned out in ecstasy.</p> <p>"Mmm... Fuck that feels good..." she moaned. "Mmm... I need you in me..."</p> <p>I held myself up over her, and began to move in and out of her. I was still fully clothed, as well as a few inches down her thigh, at the time, so it was easy to move my cock within her.</p> <p>"Ohhh yes!... You feel so good..." she moaned.</p> <p>I could feel my hips moving against hers as I slowly picked up speed, sliding in and out of her.</p> <p>"Your cock feels great inside of me..." she told me as she wrapped her legs around my waist. "Mmm... Mmm... You feel amazing!..."</p> <p>I reached back and began to rub her clit as I continued to fuck her soâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
