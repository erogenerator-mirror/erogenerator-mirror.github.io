My dick got harder and I thought I might go ahead and cum but I held back. So I got close, close and then... just to let my balls and dick to hang there. Then I let those balls hang there, let go, let go for a second, then let go again. And again. And then again. And my dick began to grow even more. So I held, let go, let go, let go. Finally, when the last big shot hit the head of my dick, I let go and there was that first, long, wonderful stream of cum as the head just kept moving.</p> <p>It was such a big load, and it kept going. And I was ready again. I knew it too. I wanted to. I had no idea how it had started. But I wanted to. I just want to. I want to fuck me.</p> <p>And that's what I did.</p> <p>I got on top of her. I wanted her so badly I almost came while she moaned in protest. But, really, I was getting hard. I think I did. And I was hoping that if I fucked her, I'd get some of the load. That's probably been a long time since I'd had a hot fuck, so this was an easy one. I put my lips to her lips, touched my lips to hers and it was hot and full. And we both kissed a little, then I got up a bit from her. I turned around and pushed her back a bit. Slowly, so I don't break a kiss. So I put one knee on the bed, put it up on the pillows, put my hands on her shoulders, pushed her head back and kissed her.</p> <p>As I did this I began to stroke my dick, making sure it was going pretty well again. When I was ready, I rolled off her and put myself down on the bed next to her, right next to her. I was watching her for a few seconds. I had watched myself for a couple of years now, but it was my first time. It didn't seem as if I was having a hard time believing the thing I'd just done to myself. It was just so... hot. And I was definitely the biggest cock I'd ever had, maybe more than anyone else.</p> <p>"Hey, I thought I was doing you..."</p> <p>"I'm ready. I'm ready. What do you think?"</p> <p>"Well, you look amazing. Did it not hurt?"</p> <p>"Noooo!"</p> <p>"Yeah," I said quietly. "It's okay. You just look like you wanted this. I guess that means I did pretty much the same thing, right?"</p> <p>"Yeah... that's right."</p> <p>"And what about you?"</p> <p>"I'm still sore... I don't really want to think about it."</p> <p>"Yeah," I said, not moving. "Whatever hurts."</p> <p>"Look, I don't know if this really means that much to you," she said.</p> <p>Just do that, I said, "This is what I'm going to do, right?"</p> <p>"Yes." She sounded disappointed. "But, I still think it's about time you did something. You've already shown no indication that you'd be okay. But I know I know you won't, okay?"</p> <p>"I'm ready. I'm so ready that even if I just wanted to fuck you again, I might be okay. That's what's happened. That's how people get their answers for life."</p> <p>"That's what I think. Now come here. Show me what you have on."</p> <p>I put my legs on her shoulder and put myself between her legs. I leaned down and kissed her again. Her mouth was a little moist, but I'm sure she smelled pretty good. We kissed a little more, then she said, "You seem to really like me."</p> <p>"That's all we have on for now. If that's okay with you."</p> <p>She sighed and said, "Okay. I know you've been seeing your dad, so... I'm just..."</p> <p>"Just what?"</p> <p>"Just checking. Just checking, and..."</p> <p>I kissed her slowly, but then I broke the kiss with her and said, "I like you. And I'm really glad I got you."</p> <p>"I'm glad you got you," she said. She gave my thigh a squeeze and then rolled to her side so she could look at me. "I really am glad you got me," then she kissed me hard.</p> <p>"And I am getting myself ready, too. I just wanted to say that."</p> <p>"Me too, sweetheart."</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"I want to be certain."</p> <p>I smiled and kissed her againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
