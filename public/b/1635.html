The kiss was passionate, and it sent a shiver up her back, leaving a trail of gooseflesh that she knew was there.</p> <p>"I know exactly what you mean," she admitted, and she felt an ache between her legs as he brought the tip of his tongue upwards, just the tip, and she watched him in awe, waiting for him to move. He began a slow journey upwards, his lips gently brushing hers as he moved. Up her neck and collarbone and then along and under her ear. She felt gooseflesh flow up her arms.</p> <p>"It's amazing," she said between gasps.</p> <p>He moved his hand upwards, and his thumb brushed the tip of her nipple. She didn't have time to think before she felt the electric shock that shot through her body and her thighs squeezed together, trapping his hand between them. She had never known it could feel this intense, and the feeling was so powerful it burned itself into her body. He moved his hand back, and she knew by the urgency of his stare, she wasn't going to be able to stop him. His hand trailed from her breast down her body, and she could feel the heat of him as he kneaded her flesh.</p> <p>As he neared her mound his tongue slid across her nipple, feeling its warmth and its texture. He ran his tongue slowly around it as he slid his fingers into her. His lips moved upward, and his tongue pressed hard into her skin as his fingers slid deeper inside her. And with one final, violent thrust of his hand he brought her over the edge, and she cried out as she came. Her thighs clamped tightly around him, and his tongue stayed inside her, as his fingers thrust and rubbed her inside.</p> <p>He lifted his head, and the scent of her was intoxicating. He brought his fingers to his lips, and she closed her eyes. They were the only sensations that drove him, the only thing that was important to her; but each time he brought her to her peak she did the same. His lips moved down to her mouth, and they shared the taste on their tongues.</p> <p>"I don't want to go," she groaned when he lifted himself up and held himself above her. She opened her eyes.</p> <p>"It's ok," he assured her. "I want it all." He kissed her forehead and lips, running his tongue between them, making a wet, sucking noise that she could only interpret as music. "I want you, too."</p> <p>She opened her eyes, and smiled. "But why?" she asked, looking a little concerned. But the grin on her face melted her heart again. "Because I want that," she murmured, "and only you."</p> <p>"How?" she heard him ask gently.</p> <p>"Because you're beautiful," her words were tinged with something else. She didn't know what, but they had to be it. But how did she know that? And if it was possible that the thought of being in such a state of arousal was more pleasant than the thought of him between her legs, then...</p> <p>"Oh, my..." Her eyes opened wide and she nodded. "Are you in a hurry?"</p> <p>"Oh, yeah," he told her as his cock slid into her. He started slowly, and she felt the warm, wet pressure of his dick filling her. She cried out, and held her breath when his hands grasped her waist and lifted her so effortlessly. He began going faster, his thrusts hard enough to make it hurt, but it had no place in her feeling so full. It was like she could float there on the edge of the ocean, but at his pace it was less intense.</p> <p>"You're amazing," he said, and the words hit her like a slap in the face. "God, I think I'm going to fall apart," she murmured, and she wrapped her arms around him as he held her down on the bed. He moved with her, and he could feel her body starting to respond to his movements and to the feeling of his cock in her, not too, but just right, and it wasn't hurting, either.</p> <p>When he'd reached climax he pulled her up so they could kiss, and she smiled as her tongue teased back at him, and then she took him down with her. The kisses became more intense, harder, and when he was close enough to climaxing they broke. She felt his body tremble as his muscles clenched, and she knew he couldn't hold off any longer. She looked down at him as she rode him, and she saw the determination in his eyes as he tried to hold his own climax while holding some control over herself.</p> <p>When the moment came, it was like a storm, and she felt his body quake as heâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
