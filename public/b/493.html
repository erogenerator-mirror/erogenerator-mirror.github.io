I said.</p> <p>"You are," He kissed the top of my head. "Oh I'd better get to my things." He said with a quick nod in what sounded like direction. He looked at me briefly as he got up and walked past me to the door.</p> <p>"Do you have anything...you know where to be?" I asked, trying to play my mind off.</p> <p>He laughed, "I am actually in this room with a friend, watching a movie." He said, "I think my roommate is up there in the next room, so he'll be out here long before I get back."</p> <p>I gave him a puzzled look. "Does he have a roommate?" I asked.</p> <p>"Nope," He said with a laugh, "I've seen him in my roommate's room a couple times. Last night was the first time we did it ourselves." He said.</p> <p>"Really?" I asked with a confused stare, thinking the last time it was us in theirs was on the couch?</p> <p>"Yeah, really," He replied.</p> <p>I looked down and noticed the crotch of his pants had risen to just below his balls. Wow...a nice cock!</p> <p>"Do you like it?" He asked.</p> <p>"I'm glad," I said, my heart rate rising.</p> <p>We shared an awkward moment. "I think I'll go and change and maybe join you," he said, "Have fun. We can talk about that later."</p> <p>"Sure, be fun," As he kissed me.</p> <p>After a moment or two he asked, "Have you had dinner yet?"</p> <p>"Uh...no," I said.</p> <p>"I'll see if I can get you something, anything, and I'll bring it to you." His hand reached down and rubbed my crotch as he left the living room.</p> <p>I felt like the most normal teenage girl in the world. No one had ever bothered to put me to bed since last night, so I was kind of embarrassed I was getting aroused. I walked naked through the house. All of my clothing seemed to be in my hamper. What the was inside the hamper? There was no way I was going back to my room without looking for it. But I couldn't. Not when he took off my bra in front of me. He was so cute. He took my hand and led me to his bedroom, his bedroom. He must have heard my footsteps as he stopped just outside the door and took the knob for me.</p> <p>The door opened and he turned to face me. I was standing there looking at him, wondering what he was going to do. I thought I saw him smiling as I walked over to him.</p> <p>"Sorry, I should probably put these on now" He said.</p> <p>He pulled his shirt off and I was finally standing naked in front of him. The shirt he was wearing hugged my tits and made them look fuller. He reached out and grabbed my cock and began to stroke me gently. I moaned lightly and he said "See anything like you did last night?"</p> <p>"Yes," I said. When he looked again, I nodded up at him.</p> <p>"No underwear, are you sure that's what you want?" His hands moved up and he stroked my chest, leaving trails of saliva across my skin. "It turns me on. I've felt this hard cock ever since I woke up naked. I don't want to do anything that will make me cum."</p> <p>"Oh," I replied. "I'm glad I could find you something to wear," I pulled it off and lay it on his floor.</p> <p>He followed me to the bathroom and sat on one of the sofas with a towel around him. "I want you to shave my cock," He said, as he stroked himself.</p> <p>"I could do that," I said quietly.</p> <p>"That wouldn't be right. I have to do it myself," he said.</p> <p>I didn't want him to. I wanted to see his cock. To hold and caress him. To pleasure him. I couldn't. I wanted to watch him cum. I needed to see his face. I couldn't resist. I slid down until my face was hovering a foot above his cock. I ran my fingers the shaft, stroking the smooth skin lightly. I felt it rise and rise in my hand. I let my hand drop and licked my lips. This was it. I moved closer to him and opened the towel away slightly. I took hold of his cock and ran my lips down the length of it, leaving just the helmet on top. It looked delicious with a hint of moisture to it. I moved the towel away and took holdâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
