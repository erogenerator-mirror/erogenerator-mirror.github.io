I think that’s how things are. Why can’t she be as happy to be around me as she is right now?”</p> <p>He shook his head vigorously. “You know you can trust me, right?”</p> <p>She smiled and nodded.</p> <p>He was silent for a long while. Then he took the phone from her hand and turned it to voice mail. “Okay, you can go now. I’ll talk to you later, sweetheart.” Before she could close the door, her phone went again.</p> <p>“No text to send,” he said, and she heard the voice mail on the other end of the phone. "Hey, I’ll send you a text if you talk to me.” "Okay, just to let you know that everything seems good.”</p> <p>She closed the door to her house and stood looking at the empty space. She thought about what he’d said about her being with him, and she thought about how he seemed to be on the verge of saying his own thing, and her fear of him left her for a moment.</p> <p>She couldn’t just let him make an impression on her again, after what he’d just done to her. So she called her son the next day.</p> <p>He seemed to be just as nervous as he sounded, as she could tell. She smiled and told him about the conversation she had with the girl at school earlier that day. They’d both talked about it, and she was starting to realize she couldn’t stop thinking about her, as well as him. She told her husband that she’d go for as long as he wanted to make love to her, but no more.</p> <p>“It’s okay, honey.”</p> <p>He’d been a good boy, he told her. Maybe a little too much.</p> <p>“I’ll stop by for about an hour and we’ll go from there, Okay?”</p> <p>“I can’t, hon.”</p> <p>He had been in his office after their talk, listening to his iPod while she was at school, playing a video to her friend from her English class, when she finally asked, “Hey, hon, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?”</p> <p>She was so shocked that they were supposed to call her that she had to be careful what she said, because if she were angry at him, it sounded crazy. She wasn’t angry at him. He was just curious about her.</p> <p>“I’m not gonna change your mind. You’ll just have to come by and try to eat. We’ll have to talk and see about what we did and if you want to go back to your own room afterwards.”</p> <p>She was almost sure he wasn’t going to get upset, because when his friend was in for lunch, she’d be able to talk with him and he wouldn’t be able to stay mad at the girl she’d had as a girlfriend.</p> <p>They agreed to meet up at her friend’s house and talk to someone there. They didn’t actually have anything in common, but in general, he was kind of a nice guy, but he seemed very strange to her. Her friendship with the guy was still strange to her. She didn’t know him well.</p> <p>After a bit more awkward silence, he said, "Hey, I just wanted to let you know that. I’m out of town with some friends right now. I might be home again in a couple hours. There’s nothing that I wanted to talk to you about, and I hope I didn’t piss you off. Would you like to talk to me about something else?"</p> <p>“I can’t do that alone.”</p> <p>He turned the phone off and said, "Come on, hon. I’ll walk you over to your friend’s house. Then I’ll cook dinner. Let’s talk here in the privacy of your own home.”</p> <p>She was a little shocked at his abruptness, and she just laughed and headed back to her friends to say goodnight to him.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>When he turned the corner of 10th and Madison Drive, he caught a young girl he’d just gotten into a fight with two minutes earlier, and he smiled and said, “Hello there, sweetie.”</p> <p>He didn’t see her, but he thought he could hear her breathing through the car window as she let him in, so he said, �—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
