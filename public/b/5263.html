I've never thought about doing this to another woman. I mean, how could anyone? It's not like I haven't done it before, but not by myself? With any woman? Never! A long distance relationship? No way! You could get fired for it...</p> <p>I look at her for several minutes before standing up and looking over her shoulders. In a way, I'm trying a little dominance here. I want to feel this woman's naked body on mine. I want to see if I can come as close to a orgasm as possible to that very point. I have to go. I'm almost out of the shop. I have to go, too.</p> <p>I go back to the counter, and I look at my watch. I should've stayed at the counter for the whole damn day. What would I do now? A good wife would walk all over me for all this, at least for now.</p> <p>Now she doesn't. But I'm still going to have to stop. I can feel my erection growing. Can I? Is this how I should get rid of it? Are we going to just be friends now? Maybe I'll even have a sex life. And I'll get a chance to do it, just once, with this woman. A free weekend at "the store", just a once. That would be fun. I could just go into work and be alone, and just go straight back to my wife.</p> <p>I try to think of something else as I walk up to my wife. I can't go and stop right now. I have to go to the hardware store to buy some new lingerie. I need a place to change. I need to buy some new lingerie if I don't come back and finish my day off on the way home. What will I wear to work? I'll just hang on to it for now, if it helps.</p> <p>I come up with what I need, thinking about the lingerie and how much better it's going to actually be. The lingerie is going to go to the shop. The new lingerie doesn't really look like a bra and panties in the "big bed" but it's more like a full-time pair of panties, complete with an extra garter thing. I will try on an extra pair. A bra would probably work better and I can make up for that. My hand comes over, and I reach down to the front and grab the new lingerie. I am ready.</p> <p>I go in the back, and try to keep the bra on. The bra looks pretty good on me, but the panties? I'll probably just pick a set to change into after my wife leaves, I mean I really have no idea what she'll think about all of this.</p> <p>It really seems like I'm going to have to go in the back, like the big bed or something. It does sort of distract me. I don't know how to go about it. I can't wear a bra so I'm going to just try on a new one, and leave the bra on and put the panties on, but it doesn't help. I've got to go back home and change clothes, but I'm a bit too anxious to go there now. Maybe this won't be a good thing or, at least, a terrible thing. She may even be a bit crazy about me.</p> <p>I have to do this. I have to make up some kind of excuse to put my hands on her body or something, but I can't. As if I're in a position to ask her to do whatever she wants to get rid of me. That's wrong. It's just not going to work out, not any different from being naked, or going shopping, or even going to work. It's a little too risky, but you know what they say about life and what they don't.</p> <p>I know better. I know all I have to do now, is try to get her to stop and stop. It just might not work. I'm not good at this sort of thing.</p> <p>I stop outside the store, and I close the door. I walk over to the register and open it to try to get my purchase out. It just doesn't work. I can tell that a customer has come in, and they walk right away. She might not even be there. Perhaps I should go there for more than I have already, but this is a woman, not a man. I'm really going to have to go in and try again, just a little, and make sure there's a way to get back there before she does.</p> <p>I close my register and walk around until I get outside. As soon as she comes in, I go back to the register, and open the door. I'm going to have to wait for her to come inside and close it.
