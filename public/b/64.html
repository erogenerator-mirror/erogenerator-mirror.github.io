Maybe later."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>*</p> <p>I watched on the monitors for a while after Mike got out of bed. The whole place seemed to move as if in slow motion. I had no idea who was doing what, but somehow the whole thing was so surreal, so sexy, and so right. When it got completely real, the first thing I noticed was that my heart really beat a little faster. It began to feel that way whenever I stared hard at the screen.</p> <p>Suddenly, I felt incredibly sexy. I had never felt so much like I was ready to be with a man, at any rate. I felt so desirable, so sexy! I felt so alive! I felt like a woman.</p> <p>I was going crazy. But... I didn't want to rush anything. It was all about the moment, about having a man's penis inside of me. I'd dreamed of that since this afternoon, when my husband had done things to me, to satisfy the need that had been growing between us. I wasn't sure exactly what I felt about Mike's penis, but it sure felt very good inside of me. It felt so good. I just let myself go.</p> <p>This time when Mike fucked me, I didn't wait for him to start moving. I let him do the work, letting him do whatever he wanted. I really did want this experience for myself, but if I had to put a stop to it, then it would have to be after Mike's sperm had been deposited in my vagina and by now, I didn't care. I wanted Mike to do it to me forever.</p> <p>I was so incredibly turned on. Mike's penis felt really nice all along the length of my labia. If I had a man inside me, I would probably think about all the ways that it could have hurt. But in that moment, I just couldn't help it. I wanted Mike's sperm inside of me. I wanted to be stretched, to have a man's sperm inside of me for as long as I could remember. I wanted it. I wanted him to fuck me, not just inside of me.</p> <p>I reached down and grabbed his penis again, feeling it begin to swell up inside his pajama pants. It wasn't erect. This time when he began to move, I realized he had become aroused. When I held that thing in my hand, I discovered that I felt like I was actually dripping wet, that I was practically sodden. It felt like it took forever to get Mike off and it felt so... I wanted... I wanted to be a woman. I wanted it to always be Mike's desire.</p> <p>Even better, he really had no effect on my mind anymore. I really felt like I had been reborn. A woman had emerged from my sexual past. My body went in a completely new direction. I felt more feminine, much more alive. I was actually feeling more like myself in that moment. I just looked into the mirror to see the way it was making me feel. I felt like Mike was fucking me, and when he would pick up the pace, when his penis would rub along my clit, I felt as if my body was making love to him.</p> <p>"God I hate this," Mike said. "Fuck this, I could really get used to this."</p> <p>I could feel some of the cum beginning to escape into my labia. I could actually feel it running out of my vagina and down my crack. It was actually beginning to feel weird coming from outside the vagina. The feeling was making me hot. But it was a feeling good that felt kind of wickedly good, like a powerful sexual pleasure. I felt like I was really starting to enjoy myself and I felt pretty close to having what I had wanted all my life. I really didn't want it to end.</p> <p>I grabbed Mike's penis more tightly. I was holding it tightly inside of me. This was my time and I was going to have it, and I'd had it before. I wrapped my fingers as tight as I could around his shaft, my nails digging into the skin of his thigh.</p> <p>Mike began to moan. I could feel his fingers on my skin, digging deeper and deeper into my flesh. It felt so different from having sex with my husband all these years ago. Now, it felt so natural that I was actually enjoying that experience.</p> <p>"You better stop this right now," I said. "This might hurt you."</p> <p>"Oh, no! I swear I never want to stop fucking you. There's nothing to stop this," he said. "You make me so hard every time I remember having you."</p> <p>I could feel his penis begin to stiffâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
