She was a slender woman with dark chocolate skin and dark eyes, and an all-natural smile that could melt the very heart of any man. She was wearing a tight black dress, and his eye could clearly see that she had not been wearing any underwear, although her legs were long and thin. If he were sitting in a restaurant, there would be no doubt in his mind where he would be looking. She had that effect on some men, and her husband, her whole body was on display as she took him around the office. She had a lovely voice as she spoke to him.</p> <p>The lady in the dark leather dress was tall with very dark hair, and had a perfect hourglass figure. Her blue eyes seemed to come back to him, and his heart beat a little faster. He could not believe how good she looked in her short black skirt and high heels, and she had a lovely round ass that he loved to see. They walked toward the front hall of the office, and as the woman opened the door and walked into the reception area he heard a soft feminine gasp.</p> <p>The man looked at her and his breath caught. She must be in her late thirties, and she wore a dark blue strapless dress that looked fabulous, and the hemline was so short it was almost like to a short skirt. It left her thighs well exposed, and it made her legs look quite sexy. Then he realised, as she stopped in the lobby, he was staring at her breasts!</p> <p>He was mesmerised. She had on a dark blue satin blouse that emphasised her large breasts. They were not large, but they perked up when she moved and swayed with the movement of her arms. The blouse was loose enough that anyone would notice, but not to the point where he would even care to look at her. The lady in the dark dress stopped in front of him, and he felt her hand on his shoulder, pushing him toward the door.</p> <p>He followed her in, and her eyes lit up as he looked around the main living room. There were still quite a few people at home, and the man in the dark dress had a brief second look at two other people that were watching from the living room and the reception area.</p> <p>They continued down a corridor, and before they knew it their hands were touching. He could still barely keep his eyes open, and couldn't stop them from falling on their own, but when he moved his hands up to touch them, the lady's hands appeared, and slid up his back, and stroked his back, leaving a hand to him to hold.</p> <p>Their hands left his, and he followed her into a bedroom. He didn't know if she liked it here or not, but they made him shower, and he was told to sit on the bed, so she could undress him, then join him in the shower.</p> <p>She sat down on the bed, her legs parting slightly, and she pulled off her dress, revealing a black skirt that was half up around her thighs and one side up to her breasts, the other side only falling off of her body. It was one of the sexiest garments, particularly the one with the slit at the back that held her labia. It was designed to give a man an unobstructed view of her pussy, and his cock would become erect. He had only ever seen her in a thong when he had masturbated in front of the mirror, and he was surprised at how she never wore knickers.</p> <p>When she stood up, looking at him sitting on the bed, she was naked again, and her hair was up in a pony tail, and her lipstick was smeared a little and very dark. She opened the glass door of the shower, and she handed the man his shower, and waited for him. He stepped toward her, and she slid the shower door closed, then held out her hand when he pulled away. "Come with me", he said.</p> <p>When he stepped out of the shower she pulled him close to her, and held onto him. It was not easy, especially when he was standing behind her, wrapped in her strong arms. There was only one reason for them to be so close. It was the way the water felt against their skin. There was so much feeling about it, and he knew that his heart would be pounding when he kissed her back. He didn't know how he would ever live out these moments.</p> <p>After the warm water, his hands trembled as he slowly stroked her breasts, and slowly ran his fingers along her belly. When his hand slid up her thigh to her pussy, he gasped at the silken softness of her. Then as if the water was suddenly on, he pulled her lips apart and he was able to reach her. "Please", he cried, asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
