"For now."</p> <p>"I'm in love with you," he said. "I just had to make a point to break it off with you."</p> <p>"And I've got nothing," she smiled. "I love this," she said, kissing him. "I just need that right now. I've known this would happen for years."</p> <p>With that, she put both arms around his neck and buried her face in his cleavage. He loved just how she felt; he was certain he'd never been with anyone as beautiful, smart, and sexy as she was. But he didn't want to.</p> <p>She looked up at him as she kissed his chest, her hands reaching for his hard, hard cock. She loved it in her hands. She knew it would make her feel amazing whenever he got in the mood.</p> <p>"I love you," she told him, pushing back her bra.</p> <p>"I love you, too," he told her.</p> <p>She sat, leaning back and sliding herself down the bed and over his body, taking his face with her hands as she came to him. She kissed him.</p> <p>"Let me, sweetheart," she told him. "Let's make love."</p> <p>She reached for his cock, stroking it. He gasped as she rubbed across the head, his fingers sliding under her panties, sliding to her opening, teasing her. She smiled, loving how nervous his body had become as she slid her pussy against his. She teased him, pushing against his hand, then her fingers moving to her clit. God, she thought, it's all getting too much, she thought.</p> <p>"I want you," she whispered, her lips searching his.</p> <p>She slipped down, letting his cock out.</p> <p>"It's okay," she said. "You have to feel it."</p> <p>He did. She was already soaking, her juices flowing down his thighs onto his cock. She slid down to his stomach, his cock disappearing into her, then he slid down, his balls pushing against her. He gasped as she slid up and down his shaft.</p> <p>"I love you, baby," she said. "Let me make love to you."</p> <p>He gasped as she sucked his cock. He couldn't believe that she would do it. The sensations were almost so good. He wondered if it would ever be like this. She sucked slowly, taking him inside her mouth and letting him slide out.</p> <p>"I love you," she told him.</p> <p>He loved her, very much. But not wanting to lose his virginity.</p> <p>"No," he whispered. "No, we shouldn't. I told you I love you."</p> <p>"Yes you did. Let me make love to you right here, baby," she said. "Let's hold still here. We don't want to rush it."</p> <p>She wrapped her arms around his neck as she moved her pussy onto his cock. She looked up at him.</p> <p>"It's okay, baby," she told him. "We can make love right here."</p> <p>He moved his hips slightly, meeting her in a long, slow stroke. She was wet. Hot. He slid more up her body, feeling her as she rocked on him. She pulled him to her, making him move up to lie on the bed. She slid up, bringing her pussy to the edge of his cock, moving slowly but firmly over his head. He cried out as she touched him, and pulled on her hips again. "Do you remember how good this is," she said. "I love it when you move me up and down."</p> <p>She was already moving up and down on him, her pussy stroking him with her legs. His moans got louder and louder as her pussy tightened a little, driving his cock hard against her.</p> <p>"You're going to make me come," he told her.</p> <p>"I'm about to," she assured him. She held down his cock, guiding it up into her pussy.</p> <p>"Can I do it now?" he asked her. "Or do you want my cock inside you now?"</p> <p>No. You can't do it now. The night's over. Your body is mine, she reminded him.</p> <p>"Do what?" he asked.</p> <p>"What do you want me to do?" she asked him. "If you're ready."</p> <p>"I'll do it," he said. "I want you to do it."</p> <p>"You are so sweet, sweetâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
