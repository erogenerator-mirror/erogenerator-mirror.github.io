The words were outta his mouth but he didn't say anything. He was focused on the screen now as he watched them, the video's beginning. The man had been stripped and on his hands and knees as he sucked on a black man's cock. The man's ass was raised in the air and he was moaning his pleasure as he rode the man's cock. The black man's face was buried inside the woman's pussy and her hands were tangled in her husband's long hair. She was pumping away at another hard cock. He reached up to her and squeezed one ass cheek. She pushed his hand away and his hand covered hers. They kissed. His mouth opened and he slid his tongue into her mouth. Her mouth went from wet to warm and she sucked on it hungrily, her tongue massaging his for long moments before she slipped away.</p> <p>He couldn't tell whether she was a bit upset for what she'd done or whether she wanted to continue. Either way, he was determined to continue watching.</p> <p>As soon as the man's lips were off the man's cock, she had straddled him and he was sliding easily back inside her. He was hard as a rock and he needed her very badly. She rose up the first time she was sitting on him and it had been very difficult to resist the urge to have that cock inside her. She didn't care now at all whether it was his or not. She just wanted more of his cock.</p> <p>"You didn't think I'd let them off that easy huh?" He felt the edge of her weight on his chest and she was rocking back and forth on his cock. Her hips were working very fluidly on his cock and his hands found their way around to her nipples. She rubbed those mounds all over his chest, nipples and his chest with a lot of tenderness. His hands were on her ass and moving up until they reached her belly. She kept rocking on him a little as she moved lower and lower. His hands went to her hips when he got it and she pulled up and got him in again. A big hand grabbed her ass cheek and squeezed hard in the same direction the other man had, pulling it open. They weren't pulling them apart but just pushing apart.</p> <p>"I don't want you thinking I don't want to do it." She wasn't saying anything but her body moved in rhythm with the man's so she had to take the lead and make the sex happen. The way he was kissing her, his hand on her lower belly and the way she was moving up and down had his cock all the way up to his balls. She would be moaning like she hadn't moaned in a while but she was enjoying the moment.</p> <p>"I don't think I do." The man was speaking.</p> <p>"Let me." And she got the message. She felt like she was going to have to ask him again for permission, if necessary, to let the man do it again. He was being such a gentleman to keep his hands off her butt so she was willing to say it again, but a little while later she should ask him.</p> <p>"You do?" It still wasn't the answer she needed. She wanted to feel how hard the man was. She wanted to feel how good he was in her. This was different. This was pure pleasure. This was like nothing else she'd ever experienced. Nothing else she'd ever felt.</p> <p>But he couldn't get it from her anymore. She took his hand away and pushed him back a little as her fingers pulled the front of his pants for her to get them off. The man didn't object once and she had to have him now. Her fingers were on him now, stroking him up and down as she kissed him. She'd felt his cock. She couldn't believe how hard it was. She couldn't believe where it was pointing at her and how it had been in her and in others. She wasn't sure if she was ready to do this again or if she would go that far. It didn't matter. She wanted him anyway. She was willing to go all the way.</p> <p>"I want to feel you when you cum."</p> <p>He laughed.</p> <p>"I want to feel you." She had to have him, didn't she? She had to know for sure if she was going to be able to do this or not.</p> <p>"If you want me to keep you," she said, smiling.</p> <p>"Oh, don't go in that direction, please."</p> <p>"I want you to do this." And she looked at him as she opened his pants, reaching inside to pull out his cock. It was hard, throbbing straight up and hard as she could make it. That and the feel of it on her skin made his cock hard as well.</p> <p>"Yesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
