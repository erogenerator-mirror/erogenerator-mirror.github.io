I wanted you to feel the power to do exactly what I wanted to do. I wanted you at the end of the night to decide if my fantasies were a match, if I was yours to fulfilment. To make love to me. To make love to you. To make you mine. I was getting increasingly turned on. I had never had to even let your girlfriend see what she really wanted. I was trying not to think about that.</p> <p>It was hard to concentrate, and I had to tell you that I was getting extremely turned on from all this. Even though I was having difficulty holding back the orgasm, I couldn't and it came too easily for me to tell you. As the night wore on, I found myself more aroused as the anticipation grew greater. I wanted to see what it would be like. I wanted to kiss your chest. I wanted to stroke myself in my fantasies. After a while, I found myself imagining we were having sex, not just lying together in bed, but kissing, feeling and stroking.</p> <p>The following morning, I was ready to spend the night with you. You had a new woman in your arms, and I was so excited for you to show her how to play with my vagina. It just didn't seem like it would happen. I wanted to have your erection inside me. But you, that is, you don't want me to come, do you?</p> <p>I decided to make sure of it. I was hoping that your response would be a yes. After thinking about it for a little while, I decided there was no more waiting, so that I could get ready and come by myself and you wouldn't have to get ready while I waited. So I took a bath, had another cup of tea and got ready in my bedroom. I opened the drawers until there was just the right amount of fabric on the right side to wear in public.</p> <p>It was a sexy dress; the fabric was light cotton and soft. I looked at myself in the mirror first, noting how the dress hugged my body tightly. It was tight, tight enough to cover enough to make the nipples protrude slightly. It was a little tight on my boobs, too. But that was the dress for the real thing. I felt comfortable with it. It looked great on me. The dress fitted beautifully, so that my boobs lifted just a little more than when I wore the dress. The neckline opened up just a bit and you could see my cleavage from behind, and it showed a lot of cleavage. And it could be just as well not to wear too much and have a man looking straight at a gorgeous woman in a transparent dress on show.</p> <p>The neckline had very little effect on the dress as I was expecting it to be slightly tighter than one would want, but I decided that, even though it had a good effect, and might just be too, I could take my dress and leave it in my room and let you look at it.</p> <p>In that instant I wanted you to tell me that it looked good. It was the only way you were going to get to see me. I didn't want you to be disappointed. So I took the dress off and pulled the neckline even further over my left shoulder and pushed the shoulder strap out of the way.</p> <p>"You look so sexy," you said as I watched me. I turned around and you saw my back, which was to bend very low, so that it looked to you as if you could see the top of my dress from my neck as well. We were talking casually and then you asked, "So, you haven't yet given me the opportunity to wear my dress in public?"</p> <p>I took a bit of pleasure in answering you. I hadn't expected that. Even though it is difficult to talk like that about how to wear something like this, you couldn't keep your mouth open and give me an answer in a matter of seconds. That's all it took. Your cock was already stiffening and pressing in your slacks.</p> <p>I put on the dress, which made of a light cotton material. The fabric hugged my stomach, exposing enough to show how my cleavage was straining just a bit too much. But I felt so exposed, you would be able to see the outline of my boobs underneath. It was such an arousing image that, even though I had an idea that you might be getting turned on by the sight, I never really thought it until now about how it could be. I knew though, that you would find the sight of me in a dress was enough to have you hard all over again in a few hours.</p> <p>I got my phone and started to text you a picture so that you would see how nice I was going to look in it. It was the first time you had noticed the effect my dress hadâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
