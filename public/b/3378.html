I've never felt you had any sexual thoughts about him and the other two."</p> <p>"Well," he began as his cheeks dimpled with anger, "if a woman's first time is so important to you, why don't you just do the first thing that comes to your mind?"</p> <p>I nodded, giving him a chance to explain himself before he closed the door and stood there, clearly frustrated.</p> <p>"Come," he said firmly, "get up and give me your towel." He stood behind me and I stood up and looked back at him.</p> <p>"Yes, sir." I said without preamble, "I'd like to go to your room now."</p> <p>"All right, my love," he said, and turned on his heel and strode out of the house, closing the door firmly behind him, and heading back upstairs. As I looked in my mirror over the sink, my heart beat was thunderous and I could picture his large body as he walked up the stairs. I heard the sound of his big boots clunking to the landing and then the creak of the floorboards; then the shower running with its whizzing sound. I turned a red and took a step back from the mirror and took a deep breath as a shiver of fear ran through me. I pulled my hair back tight, smoothed it, and then looked around again for something to cover my back up with. A robe and a towel were in the corner. I pulled the top of my nightgown up to my neck and stepped out of it, turning and walking up the stairs to the bedroom but stopping at the last step before the door. I turned around and stared in the mirror. My breathing was so heavy it was almost as if my heart was breaking as I looked at the image in the mirror. What was he thinking now? He's seen me in my little negligee a few times before.</p> <p>I'd have to get his attention before he got carried away, but I wasn't about to lose control this time. I grabbed one of the robes hanging on the bathroom door and then opened the door and stepped out into the hot sun. I picked up the towel and wrapped it around my body, pulling at my damp hair before pulling the door closed behind me and then walking slowly across the lawn in the garden along a row of trees just above our house's path. I took the path leading down the main road and then turned to look at the house from behind the tree. I stopped suddenly at the top of the next row of trees and looked out at the road as the sun set. I couldn't move anymore and I shook my head. The last thing I wanted was to leave like this, in front of this man, and then run from the house like a bitch and run right to him, just so he could fuck me. I turned and walked back to my house which was no longer the only path that had a couple of houses right in front of it and then I walked back in. The house was empty and I walked quickly across the lawn and then past a tree until it was gone.</p> <p>I walked around the house in the shadowed darkness then took up my robe as I continued my way around; stopping at every turn to admire my form and wonder if he would leave me this timeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
