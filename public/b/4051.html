"Is this your first visit to Africa?"</p> <p>"Yes, I'm an international student."</p> <p>"And you're an African-American? Wow!" She was still looking at me, even more so now than she was the first time. I was having so many feelings in my cock. My eyes returned to her tits.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>As she squeezed them one by one they jumped and she laughed.</p> <p>"Nice," she said, smiling. "You should have told me that."</p> <p>"My parents wouldn't approve," I said. "They don't approve of Africans. But they're still a nice lot."</p> <p>"Well, they're not happy when it comes to blacks around here. So I guess they don't approve of you looking at them but still can get away with it. And I like the attention. But that brings up my question, what about you? Does that mean that you're in Africa? I mean, I would like to meet you."</p> <p>"Would we meet outside?"</p> <p>"Yes, of course. But we probably won't be the last couple of weeks. We could visit you in Europe and get to know each other better."</p> <p>"I'm not too sure where I'd stay," she said, "so it should be nice to check that out when we meet."</p> <p>We got out of the truck and I showed Maria to a room for the next afternoon, while I followed her to the house. The house was nice enough until we had to go to the bathroom. We went to her room and it was already made, but she made me a drink and it was still warm. Her room had a bed, so I stripped off my clothes then took off mine before stripping her too.</p> <p>After she was naked I went down on her and we kissed again. She was so wet I could suck her tits and lick the inside of her thighs. I couldn't take my eyes off her. I wanted to fuck her like a man! She came within minutes of my licking her and her eyes went wild when she felt me get on the bed.</p> <p>"I want to fuck you."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"You know what this is, right?" She looked at me kind of funny as I had my back to her. "Come with me."</p> <p>I got on the bed before she got near because she wanted to feel me in her. She kissed it and put her hands on it. I lay down to watch her and she sat on top of me.</p> <p>"You don't look like a man," she said, pointing to my dick. "I can feel your body against me."</p> <p>"A big white man just like you? That's not a man. That's just a black man."</p> <p>"It's bigger than yours. Look at it." So saying she pulled me to her. She reached between us and found my prick and leaned against me. I could feel her tits pushing against me as she stroked me. With a soft cry she had her first orgasm. Then I started pumping my orgasm into her face.</p> <p>"What's that doing to me?" I heard her say.</p> <p>"Let it go. Cum in mama," I heard.</p> <p>I felt like something was wrong with me that I didn't get her name. So I got hold of her and we did our thing. We kept kissing as I told her more about Africa. She told her story about me and everything that went on while we slept. When she was done she told me more about her life in Africa.</p> <p>When I told her where to go to my mother's house, she said I could. When the time came I felt she had to get me in her home. She told me her name was Maria and she had never been to my mother's before.</p> <p>She told me she had to get that guy in her house too and I was happy to do it.</p> <p>When I reached her home she took a quick shower and then had changed into something a little nicer looking.</p> <p>"What did you do last night?" she asked, as she looked at herself in the mirror.</p> <p>"You know what I did," I replied, trying to remember that it was only the three times before. I knew it had been two weeks since we had made love.</p> <p>"You remember?"</p> <p>"Yes," I said, trying to stay serious.</p> <p>"When I saw you that night, I decided to tell you something," she told me, moving her arms over so that she was in front of him. She turned around so that he was facing the mirror.
