She asked.</p> <p>"Not in the slightest." I replied.</p> <p>After a few moments, she slipped out of bed and got into a clean pair of panties and took off her shirt. "You have to be at work tomorrow morning. No school till tomorrow."</p> <p>"I won't have to go if I don't get to work with you." I said grinning as I got up and walked into the bathroom to clean up and brush my teeth.</p> <p>I got dressed and grabbed my purse and walked back out into the living room. She was still watching a porn on the TV. "Why don't you go grab your laptop and laptop here."</p> <p>"Ok." Was all I could say. As I went to leave, she stood up and pulled me closer.</p> <p>"We really need to do something." She said.</p> <p>"What?" I asked.</p> <p>"We'll finish what we started." She said.</p> <p>"Ok." I said.</p> <p>With that she slid her panties down her legs and stepped out of them. I heard the sound of her flip-flop sneakers sloshing around on a carpet.</p> <p>"Where are you going?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'm going swimming." She said smiling.</p> <p>As I made my way out the front door, I saw her walk into the pool and take off her shirt. After a few seconds she pulled the straps off her shoulders and leaned back, resting her arms on the edge of the pool with her legs dangling in the water. I watched her chest rise and fall as she swam. Her breasts jiggled as she moved. Her arms glistened on the water, so did her nipples.</p> <p>"You really have the body of a goddess." I said.</p> <p>"I'm not." She replied.</p> <p>I went into the house, got the laptop and laptop, and went to bed.</p> <p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p> <p>SATURDAY LATER</p> <p>I'd been to the gym on Tuesday and Wednesday nights for some weight lifting work and was working out when I did go running. On one of these runs I saw her. It was hard to not stare as she crossed the room coming towards me. I stopped running and just stood there.</p> <p>That's when I felt it and she really caught on. It startled me at first and I looked her up and down. She was wearing a white string bikini and her breasts were straining to see. She smiled seductively at me. "You look really good." She smiled.</p> <p>"My wife likes me to look good." I said.</p> <p>"I can't wait until we get back." She continued.</p> <p>Without an ounce of sadness or anything I responded with, "We need to get going."</p> <p>"Alright." She said with a devilish smile. After all what do I know.</p> <p>I started to turn around when she said, "Not you." Then she bent down and kissed me.</p> <p>I turned and looked at her with my most sincere look that I've ever had since I turned 18. "What are you thinking?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'm going to take off and you're going to wait to see what happens next." She said.</p> <p>"You better not think I'm going to wait any longer than you think." I said.</p> <p>I thought that was a little odd because I know I didn't have a choice, but I didn't want to think it over. As I turned to leave, she stopped me and said, "Wait, go up to the bedroom. I'll meet you up there."</p> <p>All I could think about was that night. What will I do when I see her next? Will I get a hard-on? I looked at the clock. Shit. I better get on and run this through with some paper. I know. It has to wait until she gets back so I better run things over with her.</p> <p>So she grabbed my towel off the end of the pool in the hallway that led onto the bedroom and I was left at the door, waiting on her. As I passed her the towel fell to her side leaving her completely nude and ready to go.</p> <p>When things started to become an uncomfortable situation I was about to say something but she stopped me saying, "Don't forget about the swim."</p> <p>As I was about to say something, she slipped in the pool and dove right in. I couldn't help but watch her body as she swam. Even now, I'm not sure how I got along without her. The only thing I want to do right now is to go to sleep.</p> <p>++++++++++</p> <p>BRIAN'S STORY</p> <p>I couldnâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
