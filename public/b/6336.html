I said trying to keep it together.</p> <p>"What was in the newspaper?" she asked and then looked at my face.</p> <p>"Oh not much. Just something to eat, take a shower before bed, something to take a nap as well," I said.</p> <p>"Oh I see," she said. "So you do have one in common with that boy."</p> <p>"Not really," I said. "I never really did anything with him." I felt embarrassed by the way she had reacted when I told her about my affair with my ex.</p> <p>"You mean, you never even touched him?" she asked. "I'll bet that's not it either."</p> <p>"No!" I said. "It was a one time thing but we have a great sex life. That's all," I said.</p> <p>"I can't believe he cheated on you. How could he?" she asked. "What if it was just a one time event? I bet you enjoyed playing with your old man's equipment too. Then if that boy hadn't been a real hunk like you he would have enjoyed his old friend's old cock. And you know what?" she said with a smile.</p> <p>"What? You think I wouldn't have sex with him if it was just a one time thing?" I asked.</p> <p>"No, not even with you, it would have been only because I never did anything." She said sounding really upset.</p> <p>I sat with my eyes closed, looking out the window, thinking about what I had just said. I had already fucked that kid's wife and let the boy's prick in my mouth and throat with my own body. What about the other night? I had fantasized about her for years. How could it be that she would let me have sex with her old man? It sounded crazy to me. I couldn't even imagine how much it might hurt her. Was she going to want me to make that move again. After today though, I sure hoped that her old man would be pleased.</p> <p>I felt a strong wave of guilt hit me. Not my affair. I had no idea how I was going to cope with that. And while I didn't want to make a commitment to the boy's wife, I didn't think I was ready to make that move. And I didn't want to jeopardize my marriage. I didn't want to lose my freedom from his wife. I just wanted to be able to get away from this house in an easy way. Then there would be no more chance of him cheating on her with me. And how had they made that a permanent thing? And would it be too easy to have to agree to it again anyway.</p> <p>I looked out the window again, hoping that I was doing a good job of hiding my feelings about her and that my daughter being with my ex-in-law would be a problem. I could feel that I was a complete asshole. I tried to concentrate on the movie and try to sleep. But I couldn't. I was starting to wonder if I would be able to face all these bad thoughts of her again while my wife was getting ready for bed.</p> <p>I thought about the evening she had gone on with George and how much her husband was doing for her. Then I remembered that she had been in the shower earlier as well. As I was thinking about that with my mind, I looked up and saw that her hair had gotten messed up and there were wet streaks down her arms and back. Maybe she has dried herself after all. That's odd. I figured she got out from under the water in the bathroom after she got out of the tub and came back in her bedroom with a towel. She started to wash her hair when she looked up at me and gave me that devilish look again.</p> <p>With a big smile on her face she started running her hands down her body. Then she turned to me with the softest of smeared eyelashes and said, "Will you sleep with me?" With a knowing look on my face and a twinkle in my eye, I answered in the affirmative. And with that she reached over and ran her hands down my stomach, touching that hairy bush in the same manner that she had rubbed mine. As she was doing that, I looked at her body as her bare breasts came into view and her nipples stiffened as she touched me.</p> <p>"I guess I can be your first," she said as she looked in my eyes.</p> <p>I got up. I decided to walk around the house naked until I decided that it wasn't too much and that it felt fine. Besides I wanted to let her get the hang of the situation again. After all it would take a lot of convincing. When I got to the bedroom, I decided that it would only be fair to let my self-gratuity goâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
