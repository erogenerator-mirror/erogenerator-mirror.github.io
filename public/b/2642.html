We started down that way, and we could see the little motel. The parking lot wasn't as large, so I didn't feel like pulling up behind him. The motel was not as private, and that night we could have taken the one and parked there. However, the street was quite busy, and I wondered if I could pull over into a parking spot for once since they didn't close up.</p> <p>I pulled in to the lot, and parked on the third level. I got out and walked up to the open-necked window. There were a couple of people in the motel room, and a few other cars in the lot. I went to the door, and rang the doorbell, and a woman answered it. She looked around and gave me directions to the room. I went and stood next to the woman in the lobby, and she gave me this look. She didn't say a word, but I heard her say, "You can't come in here!"</p> <p>I walked in the room and opened the door, and she said, "What? What is this place?" The lights were off, so I was pretty much blind. I said, "Why don't go ahead and you can shower, and get comfortable? I'm sure you won't have any wild fantasies while you're here right now." She replied, "You're right."</p> <p>I closed the door, and I could hear the water running to get the chlorine off. I had to smile to myself. I did it, I went in the bathroom, and turned on the water. I stripped off everything, including my bathing suit. Then I was just wearing a T-shirt and shorts. Then I got the shower going, and came back out in just my shorts. I opened up the curtains, and there was a little room here in the room, so that there was no way I would bother in through there, and go to the other room. I was just going to turn on the shower when I heard the water stop. I was kind of concerned as we were naked, even though we were just on the other side of the door. I was a little shocked, but I had already guessed that she hadn't meant to be naked. I just took it for what it was.</p> <p>We got into the bathtub, and I rinsed off, then got in the shower. We were just finishing washing each other off, and I was just looking at her. I know, she may look good with the showerhead, but that thing could kill a little. I reached down and found her and she reached up and squeezed my tits and said, "What?" I said, "I was just starting to rinse off."</p> <p>"I'm a dirty little whore." I teased. She replied, "Well, you're not a dirty whore. You're a sexy little slut. Let's just go back to the bed and just fuck."</p> <p>We started with just sliding her bathrobe off. She did the same thing, and started rubbing her hands over my body. She reached around and gave my breasts, and she started sucking my nipples, which sent shudders running all through my body. I reached down and started playing with her pussy. She began to breathe quick, and my fingers were getting soaked. We finished up, dried off, and I was heading for the bed. As I approached I could smell coffee, and her body was glistening with soap. I saw a smile on her face, and then she smiled. "What? What's so funny?" I asked.</p> <p>"Nothing, just, just, it feels so good when you go through those thoughts."</p> <p>I turned to her, put my arms around her, and kissed her. "You're the only person I've ever been with. I know you're a slut, but I've been with very, very good girls." She put her arms around me, which made me feel very relaxed. She got her leg up under me, and started sucking my tits while we kissed.</p> <p>That's when I felt my pussy getting wet. It felt good to feel a hot, wet tongue in my pussy, and a hot hard cock rubbing against my inner thighs. I moaned when she went down on me, and got a good little rhythm going. I reached down and worked my fingers inside her. I wanted to be as wet as she is. It seemed to work for both of us, and I started to feel like I was ready for her finger on my clit.</p> <p>She took a few seconds to say, "What, what are you doing?" then leaned down and pulled her finger. And then she came back, and I felt her tongue going around my pussy lips. She did this for a while, then moved to get her tongue in my crack. She licked and licked and licked, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
