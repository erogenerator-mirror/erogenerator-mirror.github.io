Her smile was a tease, one of the first I'd seen in her voice.</p> <p>"I know." I responded with a cheeky wiggle of my fingers.</p> <p>"I'm not sure I should do that." She said, and leaned forward, her voice was lower, almost as if she were about to ask.</p> <p>I nodded and kissed her on the cheek. "Trust me," I whispered, kissing her again on the mouth. "I wouldn't hurt you."</p> <p>"Are you kidding?" She looked at me. She knew that I would. But didn't want to get into a scene with a woman she'd just met only a few hours ago. We'd made out like high school kids, and I've felt her up while we were in this little booth. I knew that she wanted more than just me.</p> <p>I kissed her lightly on the cheek. "I'm not trying to fuck you. I'm just trying to make this a night that I'll never forget."</p> <p>She took a soft gulp of her wine and kissed me on the lips. "I'm going to say the same thing about you," she said after a couple of minutes of our kisses. She leaned back against the back of the seat, her back on my lap. I put my arms around her and looked into her eyes. "You are one incredible man."</p> <p>"I'm glad," she said. Her eyes were still closed.</p> <p>"Me too," I assured her.</p> <p>"No, please don't," she whispered. She opened her eyes. "Not until you get my answer." She kissed my lips, the first kiss I'd ever shared with anyone.</p> <p>I kissed her lips softly. "I'm going to tell you." I kissed her on her mouth again. Her tongue slipped out to tease my lips. "Remember," I said. "I don't want to hurt you."</p> <p>We kissed briefly, then my kisses became more passionate. They were more than just passionate, they were almost frantic in their desire to be connected and connected. I loved her lips against mine. I felt the pull in her that evening as we came to that realization.</p> <p>I kissed her gently, tasting myself, savoring the feeling of her lips against mine. "You're so beautiful," I said, as the kiss deepened, my tongue slipping into her mouth. "I love you." Her answer was one of excitement. Our kiss grew more intense, deeper. Our kisses lasted longer, making our bodies tremble and shake with want.</p> <p>She pulled me up to her, wrapped a leg around me, and began to stroke my cock as we kissed. "That feels so good," she said.</p> <p>"I can barely move," I said with a chuckle.</p> <p>"You're just trying to be careful," she said. "I think you just want me, don't you?"</p> <p>"I love being with you," I said. "And if your plan isn't working, then I'm all yours."</p> <p>"My mind's made up," she said quietly. "That and a little bit of my body is a little sore." She opened her eyes, seeing that I was still fully hard. We looked at each other again.</p> <p>Without looking away, I slid my hand up her belly and began to rub her belly softly. "You're very pregnant," I told her.</p> <p>"I'm scared," she said. I kissed her on the forehead. "I know we're just taking a shower." She kissed me on the lips while I massaged her belly. "I do feel kind of empty, like I'm not really pregnant anymore." Her eyes were open, she was smiling, and she looked so beautiful looking at me.</p> <p>"The more I think about it," I said. "I think you're pregnant," I said. "You've been pregnant as long as I've known you," I said. "I'm going to call you a week late."</p> <p>"How will I face you?" she asked plaintively. "I know there is no way I'll get my panties in a daze, I'm a virgin."</p> <p>"Just like I knew you would," I said. I was suddenly afraid that there was nothing to be afraid of. She held my hand and pressed it against her pussy. "I'll call you after we have a shower," I said, kissing her lightly on the lips. "Promise me," my voice had an urgency that I had never felt before.</p> <p>"Promise you," she said.</p> <p>She pulled me close and we kissed deeply and passionately for a couple of minutes. When we were done, her lips were no longer on mine, but her breath was lightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
