I replied. "I'm just glad we took a vacation for a bit and not to be in the way or you might catch us."</p> <p>"Hey, you're not going to get caught." Katie said as she moved over and wrapped up another blanket that she had in her room. "I've not even eaten yet."</p> <p>"I'm not going to tell my parents I thought you were going to be hungry if I can help it, Katie."</p> <p>"I am starving now." She grinned as she went over and picked up my plate. "And as much as I would love to keep cooking, we can't."</p> <p>I took our plates out of the kitchen to take with us to the dining room where we each had one long island. I sat us down to have dinner and we all sat next to one another on a sofa. Then to get out of the dishes, I found Katie and Amy laying on our sides. They looked so innocent and sweet in each other's arms.</p> <p>I could feel Katie's heart beating against my arm and I could feel Amy's fingers playing with my arm that I found up close.</p> <p>"How are you feeling about this whole situation?" I asked. "Did you think I was going to let you out of my sight?"</p> <p>"Why would you think that?" She asked. "I just don't like the idea of you not being in my way around you."</p> <p>"I wouldn't think I could get caught so easy."</p> <p>"Yes, I understand." Amy said. "Just for you."</p> <p>I put my hand on Amy's stomach and started moving it down. She pushed me away. We watched each other's facial expressions. After a few seconds I found where Amy's tummy was and I started moving my hand down. She pulled her hand from my arm.</p> <p>"No. No more." She said as she sat up. "Do it now."</p> <p>I laid down on my back and brought my face towards her. She had her legs on either side of mine and was propped up on one elbow. She reached and started unbuckling my belt.</p> <p>"Oh my. That's a great idea!" She exclaimed. "It will make your trip nicer."</p> <p>We watched each other out of the corner of our eyes. I knew we shouldn't be having this conversation. It would ruin everything.</p> <p>"What I meant to ask was, where did we fit into this arrangement?" she asked. "I'm not sure I'm ready for that." She looked over at Amy.</p> <p>"There's some more about us, isn't there?" Amy asked Katie.</p> <p>Katie looked back at me. "Yes, there's a few more but not much to it."</p> <p>Amy nodded and looked over at me. "I've got an idea."</p> <p>She got off the end of the sofa and knelt down in front of me.</p> <p>"I'm ready to take some pictures, honey." She said.</p> <p>"You're not going to be so shy about it, are you?" Amy asked playfully.</p> <p>"No!" I said, smiling from ear to ear. "I was just kidding."</p> <p>Amy then knelt down in front of me and started kissing my chin and neck. The warmth of Amy's hot wet mouth on me felt so good and I couldn't wait to take my pants off. I sat up and removed my shoes and shorts.</p> <p>"I have a little project for you, you little perv." She said as she kneeled on the end of the couch. "Can you help me?"</p> <p>"Of course." I answered. "Anything you want."</p> <p>Amy grabbed the camera from her nightstand and sat next to me. In the first few seconds she was adjusting the camera settings. She had a really tight grip with her hands on my pants. My cock was raging and Amy's warm fingers felt good on me. Amy pulled down my pants and panties to my knees and spread my legs apart. My hard cock bounced in the air and she started rubbing my cock lightly. She moved her tongue down to my balls and started licking and sucking them. My cock felt so good, it was hard and swollen and Amy had taken the camera down to my knees. She slowly stroked my cock as she continued to lick my balls. "Mmmmmmm, I love watching you jerk off." She said as she looked up at me. "Don't come before I'm done."</p> <p>My cock was throbbing and was almost purple. "Mmm, I can't wait to come." I said.</p> <p>Amy leaned over and started kissing my balls and I felt her tongue running around my cock.</p> <p>"Oh, my god." I said. "What just happened?"</p> <p>Amy stood up as Katie knelt on the floorâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
