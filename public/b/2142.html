I felt her legs pressing against mine, her back rubbing up against my front making my nipples pucker. She was moaning and her arms were gripping my shoulders so tightly. She was so wet I would swear her pussy was dripping.</p> <p>"Oh you are so tight around my cock, so wet,"</p> <p>"Goddamnit baby, I hope the head of your dick is wet," she almost whispered but it was for our own good as our kissing quickened.</p> <p>I wanted to rip this girl out of the bed and throw her onto the bed, but as her hand moved onto the back of mine, my fingers had found their way between her legs. I felt the skin of her fingers brushing the head of my cock as I massaged her opening. It felt amazing! I could feel her legs tighten around me even more as she started to arch her back. For a moment in time, I almost wished I could fuck her!</p> <p>"Oh fuck me," she whispered as her legs were pushed so far back; I couldn't help myself but go deeper. Her feet came off the edge of the bed and she was leaning back against the top. I moved even closer so that her legs came to rest against my hips. Her legs were now splayed out wide, resting over both of mine. One of her feet had slipped off the edge of the bed just so. Her arms were behind her neck and her legs were wrapped about my hips so tightly I thought I was going to float and die in the sheets. I had never felt so close to any woman in my life.</p> <p>"Oh God that feels good," she gasped as her leg came up almost pressing my cock between me and her.</p> <p>"I know you do, I can feel it." I tried not to make any noise, but her moan made it difficult.</p> <p>"Fuck me! Yes baby, yes!" she yelled, her voice shaking as she came.</p> <p>"You feel good," I whispered almost in her ear as I kept moving in and out of her.</p> <p>"Oh yes, fuck my pussy, fuck it! Take me, fuck me!" she cried out as I was moving so fast and hard against her. Her hands were grabbing the edges of the bed with each thrust and her nails were digging into my back. She was pulling hard on my lower back to keep from falling off.</p> <p>"Cum with me, cum!" I heard myself repeating into her ear.</p> <p>"I want your hot cum in my pussy!" she almost said out loud, but her hips were buckling her. The sound was driving me wild! I could feel her pussy contracting and squeezing my cock over and over. She was shaking now, I felt her body go rigid but I was going to fuck her all night long and never get tired of it. She came again.</p> <p>"Yes, cum in my pussy!" she screamed as her legs squeezed so tight, I started to lose control at that point. "Oh yeah!" I yelled as if from a distance.</p> <p>"Oh God!"</p> <p>It seemed like the first time anyone ever called me "Mighty" that I could ever do that.</p> <p>Her body seemed to go into over drive as I shot load after load of my hot cum into her pussy. It felt like my cock had been permanently inside her hot hole, but after the second explosion, she was still moving and moving around in ecstasy. I couldn't take it much longer.</p> <p>I must have collapsed on top of her and we were still going in the same rhythm. After a moment of rest, she turned her head slightly and kissed me on the lips, making my cock still in her still throbbing pussy swell up.</p> <p>"I love you!" she cried as she was looking into my eyes.</p> <p>"I love you too," I told her as I rolled off of her. We lay there side to side and just held each other and kissed for a long time. It was just a sweet peck for me as if to say goodbye. It was the most beautiful moment I could ever remember and when she let go of the kiss, we were in each other's arms.</p> <p>Our bodies didn't want to move so we hugged each other tightly again. She wrapped her hand around my neck as my hand stroked her hair. We made out for another minutes while I was lying there beside her. I felt her hand moving under the towel and stroking my cheek.</p> <p>"That was incredible, "she said with an uncertain smile.</p> <p>"I'm going to take a shower," I told her.</p> <p>I got up and picked up my clothes from the floor. I couldn't tell how much time had passed and I was still naked. I grabbed my shower stuff and went into the bathroom. When I opened the door, she was standing there nakedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
