"I'll leave it up to you." She didn't reply, just watched with me. He smiled at her a little.</p> <p>There were a couple of minutes before she spoke again. "I'm glad you're here too." I nodded. "It's been a good day," she said. "Let me know if anything changes and I'll be back." I nodded and she turned to the kitchen.</p> <p>"I'd better get going," I said. I went quickly.</p> <p>"Don't go," I heard one of my roommates shout when I entered the room. But she didn't say anything or make any move. I felt her presence when she came from the door. She walked over to me. I smiled at her, still holding what I thought was a great looking smile. I had to kiss it back.</p> <p>"You're a good friend," she said. I did. "It was nice meeting you, Danny." She leaned over and kissed him on the cheek. She glanced away, but then leaned into him again. "Now I have to go home and I'll see you soon," she said as I closed my door behind her and locked it.</p> <p>"Good night."</p> <p>"Night."</p> <p>The next morning my roommate came walking in around three am. "I didn't wake you up," she said with a grin.</p> <p>"I was too happy to," I said.</p> <p>"It's not that I'm unhappy," she said.</p> <p>"No, I think it's because I can't bring myself to stay away from you," I stated. I had to say so much again, even though our conversation that morning had been short and sweet. "Why don't we go to an early lunch?" she suggested.</p> <p>"Okay, why don't you order pizza first?"</p> <p>"Oh, you mean, the Chinese? That's something else in there."</p> <p>"No, I mean, why don't you get me a Diet Coke first?" I said. She smiled, looking at me again.</p> <p>"Okay," she said. She pulled her shorts up a little and sat down. "I'm still naked," she admitted. She gave me a knowing look.</p> <p>"I'm not!" I objected. She looked at me and then looked away.</p> <p>"Of course not," she said, "because you're naked too." I nodded.</p> <p>I stood and followed her. We had just gotten started when the pizza arrived.</p> <p>"Where do you think you're going?" I asked her.</p> <p>"My roommate is going to be joining us," she said. My apartment was on the other side of town so she got to walk from the elevator to the pizza store.</p> <p>"I like the idea of you joining," I said after closing the door. I pulled my shirt off and stood naked at the counter. "Want some help?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'll put it on my list," she told me as she walked back to the door. I could see her nipples standing at attention.</p> <p>"No, I have to go. I didn't bring anything," I said. "I'll come back later."</p> <p>I went back up to my room. I stripped down to my boxers and walked to my door. It was still slightly ajar. I looked through it and saw there was no one else in the room. I slipped out the shower and stepped in. The water felt good on my naked body. I started with my fingers, slowly working it in and out of my mouth. I was really wet. A few seconds later I had a mouthful of water. I was out before I even saw the door.</p> <p>"Sorry," I said. I walked out in the hallway, back to my shower. I was so horny, I just kept thinking about nothing else than having her naked body under my covers and me in there with her.</p> <p>I was sitting in the shower and my hand was holding a cucumber. I was thinking about sex and not just getting out or having sex, but the actual act itself. I really couldn't think of anything else but having her pussy in my hand. The cucumber was wet and I had the feel of a good hard-on that was getting longer by the second. I imagined getting her off and feeling her breasts on my chest, running my fingers over her hard little nipples, rubbing her clitoris gently but firmly, making her moan with pleasure. I could just imagine the way her lips would be wrapped around a cucumber. When I was through with the cucumber and on the very verge of getting myself off again, I got out of the showerâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
