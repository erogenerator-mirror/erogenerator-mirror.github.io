I'm still not sure how to take that." He said with a smile.</p> <p>I laughed once again and nodded at the same time. I had no intention of taking a sip of his drink. He stood now and grabbed me gently in his strong arms pulling me against himself. He was so much smaller than I was and after only a couple of drinks he was already hard once again. I giggled and shook my head as I stood. He laughed.</p> <p>"Honey are you sure about this?"</p> <p>"Yes I'm sure," I said honestly.</p> <p>"Alright then! Let's get it in your bag."</p> <p>He grabbed at the bag and I giggled again. I took the bag from him and opened it up before dropping it into my bag. He stepped back and looked at me with a very pleased expression on his face.</p> <p>"Take your shirt off so I can see what we're planning for tomorrow night then, ok?" He asked as he reached behind me and with a yank he grabbed my shirt with all his strength. I let out a scream as he yanked so hard that I actually saw stars.</p> <p>My eyes were filled with tears as soon as I saw my shirt raise. He yanked so hard on the bottom of my shirt I felt it tear open, causing the bottom half of my shirt to fall away. I was covered in flames which I could feel on the outside of my shirt as well since I was laying against him. I heard someone yelling out and they had arrived. I let out a scream and fell back against him as if I wanted to cry.</p> <p>He looked at me and gave me a wicked grin as he grabbed one of my arms tightly.</p> <p>"You're not doing this for me are you?"</p> <p>"No! No no! I didn't think about sex! I'm not!" I begged as I tried to get away and he released a huge wave of fire up inside of me. I let out a scream and he laughed in my ears as he had a look at me.</p> <p>"I know what you are doing. You're just trying to get away from me or maybe me! I'd never hurt someone like that before."</p> <p>"Please just don't." I said softly.</p> <p>"Honey that was really bad! I know you're not going to like it and besides, I'm only going to help you. I just want to make you feel better about it." he said softly.</p> <p>"Please! Please, don't do this. I'm married and I can't give you a chance." I said with tears forming in my eyes.</p> <p>"Do what? You're just going to be trying to please me and then you'll be able to please yourself. I don't want that!" I cried out as my arms began to flail around.</p> <p>Another wave of fire flashed in my mind as I was struck by the anger in his eyes.</p> <p>"Why are you doing this?" I cried as I looked at him in horror.</p> <p>"Do what? That was really the idea!" he laughed again as he pulled my shirt down exposing my skin.</p> <p>"I'm just going to have to make sure that doesn't happen."</p> <p>"That's good," I managed out. "But maybe later this time," I said as I laid there helpless as his arms wrapped around my body and held me down softly. "Don't make me hurt you again!" I whispered as tears began to stream down my face again. "If that's the case I'll be in serious trouble."</p> <p>He gently pulled my shirt off and set it aside next to his bag. He lifted my head to kiss my lips lightly.</p> <p>"I would be terribly sorry if you hurt me any more," I whispered as I rubbed my hand across his cheek. "But I'll be good."</p> <p>"You'd better." He said softly as he pressed a finger in my lips softly. "Just be ready for what I have planned. Now let's just have a good night. We'll get our sleep, we'll go to bed and then we'll see if there's a way we can make it happen."</p> <p>"That sounds like a plan, but I just might not be able to sleep tonight. I really have no idea how I'm going to get through all night." I whimpered softly.</p> <p>"I'm sorry. I love that you didn't feel like a monster todayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
