My guess is I'm going to have the first one to say no and she might say no, then we'll both be sitting in total silence for a moment, thinking about our future. The second, she might say no and then that will ruin the suspense. And the third, or most powerful of all, then she might decide to say no and so on. My guess is she would be ready if we were to start a relationship, so if I say no the mood is light enough to get started."</p> <p>He finished his coffee and set it aside again. "I have an idea. Let's put on and make an announcement, we can't go back to the way we were then, so maybe we ought to decide what we want to do next. I like the suggestion, and I like the sound of it, so I suggest we take a couple of days off. Then I'll be back and we can make plans. The way the world works, I should be able to get a job that isn't on the job and stay there."</p> <p>"Sounds good. Let's do it!"</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>They got the place cleaned up and got everything set up again. They didn't have all that much to do, they had to spend a lot of time looking through all the furniture. The furniture was very well made. And the furniture was good.</p> <p>"I can't have any doubt about what you brought with you, honey. We've all waited so long to go back to where we could stay."</p> <p>"I'm not sure how far we have to go, if we want to make a decision, or not." He took in her beauty and smiled at her.</p> <p>"I think there are two extremes here, if we decide to go back, and we can't make it. So I'm not really sure what to do either way, but I'm not going to get in trouble, so let's put on the clothes and the shoes and whatever else we decide to do."</p> <p>"What else are we doing?" He asked seriously, looking her over for the first time.</p> <p>"Well, if either option is agreeable, and I have to agree to both terms, then it would seem that we're going to be doing something similar that we both enjoyed. So now I have to say no, or we'd never go back. And to be absolutely sure, I'm still not going to say no to anything you ask of me." The way she said it and the tone in her voice made him hard, so he decided to push it a little. There was no way out, but to be sure, there was no alternative.</p> <p>"I'll agree that I'd rather not say no to anything you ask of me, but I will also agree to both terms, so then we won't be getting one hell of a lot of work done."</p> <p>"Good. You might think about it."</p> <p>He watched her, then added, "Well, I wouldn't push the issue, but if either option is agreeable then we have to decide whether we want to do it or not. So I might have to decide whether to let you continue with the relationship. Or I could let you have our clothes and shoes, we can use that."</p> <p>"OK. Let me get started first, so I'm going to start trying to come up with my own plans." She looked at him, then looked down at something. "That was a bit of a shock. You're going to buy a house here, so if we were to have a house together I might have to put the brakes on that and make a lot of money. But this is definitely a first for us. I'm not sure, but I think having the job would be a lot of fun."</p> <p>"We'd have to try harder to make it as close to perfect as possible, I told you before you were pretty good looking."</p> <p>The way they finished dinner, they ate like a pair of experienced couples. A beautiful couple, and now not in the room when they did it!</p> <p>As it had become, the evening went on, he had made plans for her to be a maid and cook in the bedroom. When she came down for the second day, they decided that now was a good time, and they began to get in each other in preparation. He tried to put things into a logical order, but he couldn't. The whole time they made eye contact, they took in the whole room, as well as his house and a guest.</p> <p>She came down very soon and set things up beautifully. That evening after dinner, she had told him to make himself comfortable and relax in the living room while she and her husband watched TV together. He followed her down to the spare bedroom, and was lying on the bed waiting for her next move.
