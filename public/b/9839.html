I whispered to her.</p> <p>"Yes," she replied softly, "It is very true, but even more so the truth. So I did, too."</p> <p>"Me too," I said, kissing her lips, "But for a change it was so, so wrong. So wrong that I can't really explain."</p> <p>She looked up in surprise and surprise, and laughed, though that was barely a sound in the small room. She ran her fingers through my hair and sighed, "But you understand, baby, understand?"</p> <p>I nodded, then turned to look at her, and leaned forward for a kiss. "You really seem to have become so beautiful, Lacey," I said softly, "It was really my fault. I was trying to get you there, to find out what else about sex was there to be scared about." I kissed her again, "I'm sorry, Lacey, but that was a mistake. I never meant to make a mistake when we've got you where we both do."</p> <p>"I understand, sweetie," she said, kissing me gently, "I'm sorry it didn't happen with everyone else in college."</p> <p>"Nobody made you do anything, no one," I reassured her, "Nobody ever made you regret it. That's really, really cool."</p> <p>"Is it?" she asked, "Is it so cool that I'm not just a girl who only ever wanted anal?"</p> <p>"Nah," I said, "I've got you. You're like an ice cream cone, Lacey. It's so cool to play with you in it. All I have to do is play with the ice cream. But it doesn't feel like that to me."</p> <p>Then I pulled her up to me and slipped out of my panties. I pressed her back against the sofa and kissed her once more, "You did this for me," I said softly, "And for you too."</p> <p>Then I lifted up, and dropped her down on the sofa, so her ass was on the seat cushion and her head and ass was in my lap. For a moment I just held her there and enjoyed the sight of her, her tight ass exposed to me, her ass cheeks moving with my strokes, her hair spread out along the sofa. Then I stood, and walked up behind her, standing on the sofa in front of her, my cock jutting out obscenely in front of her. I stroked her hair and back with one hand, while I knelt behind her, "Let's take it from here," I breathed, "Let me make love to you from behind."</p> <p>"I... I don't know," Lacey said hesitantly. She reached behind her and touched my cock, "It's so hard."</p> <p>"It really is," I assured her. "Just do what comes naturally."</p> <p>She bent her leg up behind me, and I used the front of my left hand to pull her other one up so it was beside mine, and leaned in and kissed her right cheek. Then I held her right cheek open, exposing her asshole. I could see the lips of her pussy peeking out, her pink center, as she slowly and softly pushed back against my cock.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful," I said softly.</p> <p>"So smooth," she said, and her pussy became wet again, a slight tingle at the thought of me fucking our brains out in front of our friends.</p> <p>I leaned in again, then slid my hand up her back, cupping her right cheek, and then ran the flat of my hand around her ass as I slid my cock back and forth and side to side. Lacey moaned with pleasure, and I knew she was ready for me.</p> <p>I reached back until my finger grazed her pussy lips, and then traced them up and down her lips, watching them slide up inside her slit, and down, inside her hole, and back out again. Then I ran my finger down to the top of her crack and I held it there, waiting.</p> <p>Lacey's breath quickened. My finger slid deep inside her, and I stopped to allow her a few seconds. Then I ran my finger down over her asshole again and back up her pussy to her clit, which I brushed against. I ran the tip lightly on her clit as I slid my finger from her pussy back down her ass, and back up the inside of her pussy to the top of her hole.</p> <p>She moaned, and I had to pause just once to keep breathing. Then I plunged my finger into her pussy again, and she moaned again, "Oh yes," just as I could feel the walls of her cunt convulsing and starting to clench around my fingerâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
