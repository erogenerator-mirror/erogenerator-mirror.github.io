I'm going out on a limb there."</p> <p>"What sort of girl is this," I asked.</p> <p>"I'm pretty sure you don't remember me," she said.</p> <p>"No honey, you don't remember me, I've been gone too long," I said. I pulled out the camera again and took a picture of her from the back of the couch while she was leaning back on the couch. I took another picture of her.</p> <p>"Whoa. Slow down, it's a long story. And yes, I've been gone for quite a long time," she said.</p> <p>"I am going to be in Vegas tomorrow," I said. "Let's go. Oh, and don't call your husband again. I don't think he's going to be upset with you doing that."</p> <p>We went to the airport and she took her bags to her room. I found them in the baggage hold and took them. I had already packed my stuff in the car and I was ready to go. I went in to see where our spouses were staying so I could have my own room.</p> <p>"Don't worry about it mom. I'll have my own bathroom with this room. Don't worry, I just forgot to bring a toothbrush. I figured on this," I said. We kissed while we carried the bags in.</p> <p>We finally got to our rooms. I took my bag out and unpacked all of my things before unpacking mine. I took the trash out to the floor and turned the TV on, and put in some fresh batteries. It still needed to charge, but the time was right.</p> <p>I went out to the car and took two new suits and a set of towels with me. We went to our room and checked in. The room was really small but had a lot of room. Mom seemed to have her own bathroom, but my room was bigger.</p> <p>I took a cold shower while I sat on the bed waiting. A couple of hours passed before I heard the front door open. I waited and watched until we were out of sight, then I went out to get dressed. I looked in the mirror. It's been a long day. I felt great. But there was something to it. Something felt right and different. But that's impossible. Something was different and I wasn't sure about when. I looked at my body in the mirror and knew that everything that was still a little bit the same was only a little bit different. But what is true? What does a body have to be the same? What happens in Vegas is that we don't really know the answers to that question.</p> <p>I was feeling more alive than I had ever felt in my life. I just wasn't sure what to think about all of this. And all of this in an hour, my heart was beating like never before. I wasn't sure it would be long, when the door opened again. I had no idea how we were going to be able to get out of there. After what had passed between us, we couldn't go back there anymore.</p> <p>"Honey, we have to go," Mom said.</p> <p>"So?"</p> <p>"No. Let's just take a couple of days and go."</p> <p>*****</p> <p>To be continued – again.
