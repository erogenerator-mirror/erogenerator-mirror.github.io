He wrapped his arms around her. He started kissing her while he slid his hand down and felt her wetness. She spread herself on his fingers and held him tight.</p> <p>"I need to do something big, and bad. I could get addicted to this," He told her.</p> <p>He slipped a finger between her swollen lips. "What do you need to do?" He asked her.</p> <p>"Fuck me," She said. "Fuck my pussy." He knew she couldn't talk when she got this high.</p> <p>He slid his shaft in with one hand and felt her softness around the other one. She was wet and ready. He rubbed her wetness on her opening and she moaned when he slipped into her warm wet chamber. She felt like a tiny furnace waiting to be released. He slid his cock deeper between her legs, pushing her against the mattress as he entered her, stopping.</p> <p>"Fuck me, please, I'm going to orgasm." She cried.</p> <p>He loved the sound of that. She felt so tight around him, like velvet. He knew he wouldn't be able to last much longer. He knew it would be worth it. He didn't know how long it would take. He looked down into her face and was surprised to see tears in her eyes. He felt them and wanted to keep moving.</p> <p>"Don't worry, I'll make it feel good." She felt something strange touching her breasts as he pushed into her again. She was getting louder when she felt something hard press against her opening.</p> <p>"What the fuck!" She cried. "It's too big."</p> <p>"I know." He thrust his hips into hers. "I had this in my pants. I know your pussy has been stretched," He whispered.</p> <p>"Oh!" She said. "It's hurting!"</p> <p>"No, it's good," He said as he felt her begin squeezing him. "I can't tell!"</p> <p>"It feels good now." She was almost delirious. "I want it all." She yelled.</p> <p>She felt him begin to slip out and she lifted her hips. He pushed back into her, deeper than before. He held still until she was sure of herself enough to continue. Then, she moved his hips and felt the head of his cock slip in before she knew.</p> <p>"My god," She whimpered. "It's too big."</p> <p>"It's just like you imagined," He whispered as he felt her pussy tighten around him.</p> <p>She closed her eyes and moved her hips. Then, she felt the most intense, overwhelming feeling of pleasure engulf her. She felt tears pool on her cheeks. It wasn't the first time she'd been taken by someone else but this time was different. It made her feel like someone might take her virginity instead of her husband, she realized. She felt like she was about to burst. She felt like she was going to die.</p> <p>She closed her eyes and let the feeling take over. With one last thrust, he pulled himself almost out. She could feel him filling her, spreading her out until she thought just about his entire cock. She felt completely empty.</p> <p>"I think I love you," He whispered when his cock started leaking a bit.</p> <p>"You know I don't," She moaned, kissing him softly. She felt warm all over. "Please."</p> <p>"I love you, too. Just like you said I could never be like you." He held her as his dick softened inside of her.</p> <p>"Thank you," He said softly.</p> <p>"I have something to tell you," She said. "This isn't real."</p> <p>"No it isn't." He turned her so that they were looking at each other. He was smiling.</p> <p>"You don't have to do anything you want to though," He told her. "You'd get used to it. Or else."</p> <p>She smiled. "Maybe there are a couple of days until I get settled. Then I'll let myself enjoy life."</p> <p>"Maybe it wouldn't hurt the way it hurt me to see you doing that." He told her. "But, once I'm settled, I'll do it on the condition you'll stay with me."</p> <p>She nodded. "I'm sure we'll be busyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
