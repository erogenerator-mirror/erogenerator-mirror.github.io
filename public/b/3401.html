He said, as he stood, pulled off his robe, and dropped it to the floor. He stepped out of his shorts, stood nude from the waist down, as his erection began to show from its confinement.</p> <p>"Sit down, dear," she began the instructions, as she knelt beside the bed. She lifted her hands to stroke him and he moaned quietly as his penis began to swell. She leaned forward and began to softly run her fingers over his balls.</p> <p>He closed his eyes and moaned. She began to slowly stroke him until, as he began to jerk, she leaned back to kiss him, sliding her hand up his thigh into his lap as she cupped and massaged his testicles, teasing him as she rubbed against him with her thumb and forefinger.</p> <p>"Yes," he whispered, his voice a raspy whisper, "More," she purred, sliding her lips against his and sliding up his tummy to kiss him, her tongue slipping between his lips, gently pressing against his, gently rubbing him as her hand continued to stroke the base of his shaft. He closed his eyes again and shuddered as she slid down his body and began to kiss and lick his nipples, which caused him to suck in his breath as she teased his nipples with her tongue. He lifted his arms and began to stroke her as her fingers slid over his balls and pressed against his opening, her touch gentle. As he moaned his hips began to move, and he knew that he was close to losing control.</p> <p>She rolled him over and climbed on top of him and kissed him again as her hand reached to his hardness and stroked him gently, lightly, as he moaned and gasped. She slid down and began to lick over his tummy before lifting her face and sliding him between her lips. She pulled his hips up then lowered her body on top of him as her lips wrapped around him in a searing sucking motion and her tongue flicked against the head of his penis. He moaned as she slowly and rhythmically brought him higher and higher, until his whole body seemed to be taut. She raised her head a little and looked at his face as he gasped again.</p> <p>She climbed off of him, her breasts swaying sexily. He looked up to see her hands on her hips as she looked down at him. Her hand reached out and guided him toward her lips, and slid over her belly before her legs came together around him. He held her and began to slide himself into her slowly, his body shaking with desire against her as he slid deeper and deeper. Then he stopped, feeling the pressure on his shaft as she slid over him in the throes of passion as he slid deep into her.</p> <p>She began to gyrate her hips against him, rubbing her wet labia against his throbbing penis as he sank deeper into her, then began to fuck herself against him. She cried out as she came again and he came with her, both of them moaning and sighing with bliss as they came together.</p> <p>She continued to writhe against him, enjoying the feel of him inside her as he thrust up into her, their own cries and groans mixing, as they slid over each other until he sank deep and lay on top of her, kissing her lips and face as he kissed her neck, her shoulders, and her nipples. She rolled him onto his back so she could suck him again and began to thrust against him while she ran her finger up and down his shaft, which quickly jerked in her hand as his shaft was brought to hardness again.</p> <p>Before she left the bed for the night, she reached up to him and stroked his face, her other hand sliding around his chest and belly as his hips rose to meet hers. She brought her hands to his shaft and began to stroke it as her legs wrapped around him and her tongue began to trail over his lips and he moaned as she slid her hips back and forth in front of him, rubbing her vagina against his stiff penis as she rubbed her clitoris against his stomach. His hips began to thrust against her with little motions, each one more powerful than the previous one, and he could feel himself going harder as she did.</p> <p>"Now it is my turn," she said, as she rose from the bed and pulled him out of the corner of her eye. "It is important that you come. I want you to come." She lay down in front of him, pulling him down so he joined her while she continued to stroke his shaft. He moaned again, more at the need to come this morning as he was so full of her body, as she continued to stroke him, rubbing her clitoris on him with one hand and using the other to stroke his hardness while she continued to lick and kiss him, stroking him with her soft lips and then back up to hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
