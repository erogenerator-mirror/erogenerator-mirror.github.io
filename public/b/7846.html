Is there nothing you can take off here? I want you to get your own place.'</p> <p>With the sudden change in mood the tears ran wild down her cheeks. She opened the car door and threw herself in his arms before he could even take a step.</p> <p>Chapter Two:</p> <p>He came outside after another hour and sat beside her on the sofa. He put a hand on her shoulder and caressed it slowly. Her face was still wet with tears but her arms still around his neck. She leaned toward him, placing her lips on his. He wrapped their arms around her and she kissed him. As she started to pull away he turned her and they sat side by side at the table.</p> <p>Katarina wanted all her space in the world to just lie back. But she also didn't want to see the way he had gotten into her system. He was still in control. It was what had started all over and she loved it.</p> <p>'I love you.' he whispered.</p> <p>'I love you too.' she softly replied.</p> <p>'What have you been doing? This whole time you've been going on about how much she can do for you.'</p> <p>'I just don't know. It's a good job you're doing yourself, otherwise I might have to come and kick you out or something.'</p> <p>He didn't respond right away. He just turned up the light. When it was fully dark, she turned to look at him. Seeing him was like nothing she had ever imagined. He was in control of everything that made her feel so alive.</p> <p>'Oh, you're so handsome.' she said when his eyes finally fell on her face.</p> <p>He put the car in reverse and left the lights off when he was out of sight. She got up to go get him a large glass of water and brought it back to his arm.</p> <p>'What am I going to do now?' she thought.</p> <p>'When I got here I put this on you.' he offered.</p> <p>'That's okay. It's nice now.'</p> <p>'Do you mind me driving?"</p> <p>'Not at all. As far as I'm concerned, you're fine.'</p> <p>He sat in the passenger seat and opened the door.</p> <p>"You don't have to do this, I understand.'</p> <p>'I just thought it would make it a nice surprise."</p> <p>'Yes, of course. I didn't think that it would be as hot as what we've done here.'</p> <p>'Katarina! You never said that about me!'</p> <p>'Oh, right. And now that this evening is over, I'm going to give you another chance before I go away.'</p> <p>'I was hoping that you wouldn't be too happy about this.'</p> <p>He started to get in the car and she put her face in her hands again, 'What was that all about?'</p> <p>'You. Now we're not doing anything. There's no need for you to do anything.' she whispered.</p> <p>'I understand.'</p> <p>'That's great. But we're still together, okay?'</p> <p>"Yes we are." he said and the car started to move.</p> <p>Katarina had never been this nervous. She felt like she wanted to cry again. He hadn't asked her to go to her place but this time he was asking her to come home. She felt more relaxed with him and this time he wasn't showing it when he touched her arm.</p> <p>'Don't be shy.'</p> <p>She felt warm inside. She wasn't sure where this was leading. He wanted her for himself and maybe a little more of it. She knew it wasn't the place. It was something they had shared before but not now. They had done this. No more questions were asked now. He had already said yes and she knew it was going to happen. She was going to stay his woman. No more worrying about it.</p> <p>"Thank you for the ride." she heard him whisper when they stepped out of the car.</p> <p>"How was your day?" he asked.</p> <p>"It was ok. I felt better in the moment."</p> <p>He got out of the car and opened her door. He held her hand and gently helped her out. They walked through the door into her living room. Katarina went to the couch and sat down on her corner.</p> <p>He came down the stairs and stood by her. His hand went to her face and pulled her eyes up to meet. He held her eyes for a moment.</p> <p>"I want you to know that nothing but love goesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
