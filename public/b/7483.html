Her hands had a little gooey look to them, and before she could speak it was the first time, all the while, staring into the screen, as it played out in her mind. She had never really thought about it, so far, it wasn't even that. Yet, she found herself sitting there with only one thing on her mind, and her mind drifted so slowly.</p> <p>She was feeling, and seeing, a strong bond between them. This was going to be good, she thought as she looked at the screen.</p> <p>He stood and pulled her face down to kiss her gently, "I'm sorry, sweetheart. I shouldn't have done it," he said.</p> <p>"No..." she said, and she broke off the kiss and looked up at him shyly.</p> <p>"No, it's alright. It's very nice, and very special. I don't really know if I can... do this."</p> <p>"You got that right," and she turned back to the movie as if it did it all automatically. After a few more minutes, and her breathing slowing, the screen returned to normal. It was time to go back to her bed. But he would have to do it again, this time, she had to try to give herself one. He was not going to stop her, but this time, he would have to do it, and she had to try. Then, they would go back to the real world and try to figure out how to do it again. She didn't seem to want to.</p> <p>She got up and walked around to the bed, and leaned over to put the video on the nightstand. She had no idea how to put it in, so she turned sideways, and lay on her stomach. She pulled a sheet up over her, pulled her shorts and shirt over her, and laid her head back onto the pillow. She listened to a little of the video, which continued well into the next daydream about being in his arms when they were in the pool. She tried to remember how it had gone, but couldn't get her head about all that. She closed her eyes and just enjoyed the feel of his hard body.</p> <p>He came back down the line once more and lay down, and was a good deal taller than she was. He was a little more broad of build, though, which she liked as well. He was also not nearly as big as he had been then, but still a lot bigger than he was. She had to admit, they fit comfortably together.</p> <p>She heard him moving around a little bit from the movie and turned back. He had a condom in one hand, and both she and the bed were carrying a little heavy and he had to hold her against the bed if she wanted to put her head on the side. She turned so that she could wrap the sheet over her, and he rolled off of the bed and got his pants on. She was thinking to herself, "Well, I guess you get what you want now..." and she pushed herself to try and get his cock with her mouth, once more. But of course, it was too small.</p> <p>He was still standing there, watching her getting ready to give him a blowjob, when suddenly he walked around to the side of the bed and sat down next to her on the side by the window. He took a little bit of a swing and made a few slaps, and he pulled her toward the bed and she leaned forward to put her face on the bed.</p> <p>She got up on the bed.</p> <p>"Oh, I like that, baby," and she lay down next to him, her hand holding his cock to help her up. He lay there and played with her tits for a little while.</p> <p>They just laid there for a little longer, until he took over.</p> <p>"What about you?" she said quietly, trying to decide what to do next. "Do you want to make love? It doesn't have to be just about oral, and..."</p> <p>His hand was under her bottom and he ran his fingers down between her legs.</p> <p>"If we fuck, we should do something about that," he said as he stroked her pussy to try and lubricate it.</p> <p>"But, I thought we might..." she was having trouble breathing. "What if it... happens?"</p> <p>"We could try to go slow," he said. "You know, just to make sure."</p> <p>"Mmmm, that'd be nice," was all she could say. She thought maybe she was starting to feel asleep, but knew it was going to happen anyway if she tried to get it in.</p> <p>She looked up at him and said, "Just... wait a little... a little..."</p> <p>"Just tell me if that can be a problem," he said. And that'sâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
