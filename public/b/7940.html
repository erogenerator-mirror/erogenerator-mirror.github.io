I had just had the most incredible, erotic, sensual orgasm of my life. I looked across the bed to see that he had moved behind her and was slowly sliding himself into her. It took his penis almost all the way in, but after about five or six strokes he was in her.</p> <p>'Oh, God!' she muttered and then let out a long groan of pleasure and, even more loudly, 'Oh, God! Oh, God!' with that final 'Oh! Oh, God!' as he began to pound his cock deep into her body.</p> <p>We'd just taken the first and last step of moving to a different dimension when she said one more thing that made me stop in my tracks. "Let's go and clean up."</p> <p>"Okay," I said. "Let's go and find a place to set up in a little more privacy in the middle of the bed." She looked at me a little wistfully. "But first, we'll have to get this dress off of you. It'll be a lot of fun."</p> <p>She pulled an idea out of her imagination and rolled over on to her back. Her hands began massaging her breasts while she continued to fondle herself. I started with her neck and nibbling her ear. "I think we should get you dressed now."</p> <p>That seemed to give her pause for more thought. "Well, you two, since this is what you want and have been waiting for, you know that can't happen unless you have a boyfriend." She laughed. "It's all a matter of money, and while I like to be paid for my pleasure... well, I like to take care of it in return." She laughed again, a soft, soft, loving sound.</p> <p>A couple of hours later, she was nude, but lying on the bed with the sheets half on top of her and her legs splayed out in front of her. I couldn't remember the last time I saw her like that, so all I could come up with was my imagination. I sat on the edge of the bed and just studied her. Her long, slender legs with the little tuft of soft blonde hair above the knee, the perfectly rounded breasts capped by nipples pointing at the ceiling and the long, taut stomach. She seemed to be in the mood for a challenge, so I just stood and watched my beautiful partner go to bed and soon join her wherever she left off.</p> <p>A couple of hours later, we were lying beside each other. The next morning I was awoken by the sound of my cell phone ringing on the nightstand. It sounded like we had a meeting to begin. I got up and picked the phone up.</p> <p>"Hello?"</p> <p>"Hey, my lover."</p> <p>"Good morning," I said.</p> <p>"Good morning, honey. How'd it go? What you did?"</p> <p>"I made love to Sam. I made her feel good. When I finally pulled out of her I thought she was satisfied."</p> <p>"What was all these questions? Why had she wanted you and then why... you know, I told you."</p> <p>"It's been years, and I thought I was finally about to go through with it."</p> <p>"When did you finally decide to come home?"</p> <p>"It was on the morning after I left the apartment I met Sam at the hotel."</p> <p>"And how far along are you?"</p> <p>In my fantasy I told her how I was in love with her and that I wanted her to be a part of my life. She asked what I had told her to do. I told her that I wanted it very, very much. She told me that I was right. It had been fifteen years since she'd told me this. She told me that I would not have believed that a woman would have that much trust in her lover. I had to tell her the truth, and while she never knew her lover so closely, at least with a new lover it was difficult to believe. It had taken her less than a week to find out, and the fact that she knew it had been so intimate, even if it was my own fantasy was too exciting to pass up. Now that I knew it was all true, I wasn't sure what it was that got over her.</p> <p>I also decided, after my first real experience with a woman, that I probably shouldn't have to hide it from her any longer. "It would probably be better to keep some things to ourselves." It seemed only natural to tell her that she would have to move on with her life in order to find a husband of her own, but at the same time, I didn't seem to be making a big deal about having someone else. This time I was feeling too comfortable to be with someone I didn't know.</p> <p>"Sam..." I started.</p> <p>"No. Listenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
