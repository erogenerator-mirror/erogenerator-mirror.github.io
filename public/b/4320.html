A huge orgasm that rocked her body. She felt it build from deep into her pussy, and then it was just waves of pleasure rolling over her. When the orgasms finally subsided she looked away.</p> <p>"It was a good one," she said softly.</p> <p>"It was a good one," he agreed, smiling and pulling his finger out of her pussy. "That was intense."</p> <p>She smiled, looking down at the cum that pooled at her butt and watched it fall to the floor.</p> <p>"Let's go get something to eat," he said.</p> <p>"What about my car?" she asked.</p> <p>"I'm not interested in using one," he said, moving a bit. "We can fix up the rental and I'll drive you home. You can have my car in the morning and have my car while we have our lunch."</p> <p>"I can have my car in the morning," she said, "but I'm not ready to drive to school yet. I want to go out a day early and have my own place."</p> <p>"The rest of the semester, we can find something."</p> <p>"That's it," she said. "We could go to school together." She said it so softly he thought she was being serious, then she saw the tears forming in his eyes. "We can go to school together. I've wanted to start now that I moved out of my dorm, but it wasn't going to happen so I wasn't going to wait." Tears started again while she looked at him and started to cry.</p> <p>"That's it," he said, "that's not what I asked."</p> <p>"I didn't want a car." she said, "I didn't want a boyfriend. I wanted someone I could trust for the sake of being with you. That I could trust you to be my one true love." Tears rolled down her face, and into her hair before she sat up.</p> <p>"Is it your way to remember me?" she asked. With a tear running down her cheek she nodded to him.</p> <p>"I can't. I just can't," he whispered, pulling her into his arms.</p> <p>"That was the most intense orgasm I've ever had," she told him. "It was good."</p> <p>"It was good too," he told her softly. "It was good to have someone love you. That it was good to know you're a good person and a good person to love. It's okay to say anything that is not really what you want."</p> <p>"Yes," she said, looking into his eyes. "I do want to be your one true love." She didn't say it to show she meant it, but when he put it that way she thought it meant she wanted to take it that way.</p> <p>He reached up and held her face, her eyes looking deep into his. "I want to make sure there's nothing I can't make you enjoy."</p> <p>"Are you sure," she said again.</p> <p>"Yes. If you can live with being your true love, yes, I want to be your one true love."</p> <p>"Good," she told him seriously. "I love you."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>To be continuedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
