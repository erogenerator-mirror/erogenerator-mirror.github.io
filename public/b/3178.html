You may have made many men do it. But... if you continue with this... I doubt it will happen."</p> <p>"I know you don't believe the worst about me, but... that doesn't mean I want to keep on doing things with..."</p> <p>"You don't have to answer me. I know you can't... and I know I don't want to lose you again. I still remember how angry I was with you, but it's worth every bit of it when you're the only thing I've ever been in love with."</p> <p>Her eyes grew big and she looked away. She didn't know what to think. It could be true. But... she didn't know how to react. She knew it would be true. She just... had a weird feeling. It didn't worry her too much when she was angry. "But..."</p> <p>"But," I prompted. I was surprised when the tears started to run down her face the second I said it. I held it back, but a tiny bit at a time, I tried to be the voice. "I didn't mean to hurt you."</p> <p>"No." She shook her head. The fact that she was upset with me wasn't a problem anymore. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you again."</p> <p>"It's not that. It's just that..."</p> <p>"It's ok."</p> <p>Her eyes were begging me to be quiet. I was in a daze. Even though I'd only made a minor mistake, I could see the depth of a deep, powerful love, that I'd never felt with any other man! I felt her strong arms tighten around me. I couldn't stand the silence anymore.</p> <p>I lowered my lips and kissed her softly. "You did the right thing by putting me through that." I meant it as a gentle compliment and I meant it just as much as she did. I wanted to show her a kindness, a kindness... a love that wouldn't be lost on anyone.</p> <p>The kiss was soft and sweet, but I didn't let it go on too long. When it finally broke, I could feel my body relax under her. Her skin comforted me like a blanket. She smiled. "I'm glad you're ok." She was still sniffling into my hair. "You didn't hurt or hurt anyone... I..." I felt so much love in her eyes that I could feel it. I was afraid it wouldn't be anything she hadn't felt before.</p> <p>"I wasn't expecting to end up where I thought I was," I said.</p> <p>"But things changed again. You're no longer afraid, are you?"</p> <p>It took me a few moments to answer her. "No. Not at all."</p> <p>We kissed again. It seemed like we just couldn't break apart. The kiss went on long enough that I couldn't help it. It reminded me of how much of a good kiss meant for her. I didn't want it to end, but I tried.</p> <p>"Would you love me... forever?" She leaned her head back and stared up at me.</p> <p>"Not for a moment." I was surprised by how fast I said it. "I'm just worried that things won't come to this... together again."</p> <p>She nodded and we kissed again. The next morning, we talked.</p> <p>"Will we see each other again?" I asked her.</p> <p>"I hope so."</p> <p>Her eyes never fell but spoke, "Will it mean a lot if we do that again, forever?"</p> <p>"I don't know. Maybe. I guess the best thing we can do is be with each other. I hope that's enough."</p> <p>"Maybe," She smiled and kissed me, "I love you so muchâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
