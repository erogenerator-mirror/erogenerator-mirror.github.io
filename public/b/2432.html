She said.</p> <p>"No, I guess not. My name is Sarah." He said.</p> <p>"This place must be awful." She said.</p> <p>"I live in a little old mansion on the west side of town. It's a little quiet. Do you like it?"</p> <p>"It's very quiet and peaceful here. Just a lot of people." She said.</p> <p>Then we got into a discussion about how to live in town and get used to being here.</p> <p>"Do you get hungry?" He asked.</p> <p>"No", she said, "I'm just nervous, but the food is great."</p> <p>"Do you want to get some things from your fridge?" He asked.</p> <p>"No" she said, "Just to keep the food warm."</p> <p>"Here, we can order something from the store."</p> <p>After a little bit of discussion from him about things to do when moving into town, we finished talking and ordered up some pizza. When we got back to the house, Sarah and her pizza, her mom had some dinner at the table. The conversation started with what she had been talking to him about.</p> <p>"I told you I was very scared of you when we first met." She said.</p> <p>"I'm not going to tell" he said quickly.</p> <p>"Well, I don't have anything to hide, especially when I'm talking to you."</p> <p>"I'm not going to hide anything, my mom told me." He said.</p> <p>"I just meant it when I said I had always been scared of you. It's not something I like about you. I mean, I've not done anything against you, but we have never really talked about anything like we have had, I don't really remember having that discussion. Now I'm curious, and I don't want to take advantage of it." Sarah said.</p> <p>"Sarah, I'm not used to being in a situation like this." He said.</p> <p>Just then, a shadow in the kitchen doorway. I saw Sarah jump. I stopped what I was doing and turned towards the door. As I looked through the peep hole in the door, I saw Sarah standing there with a wide smile on her face.</p> <p>"Sarah, is everything okay?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, everything is going fine. I guess the pizza was a little warm. I didn't want you to think I was a lesbian." She said.</p> <p>"No, this is just the way it has to be." I said.</p> <p>"Don't you want to get your little girl back to the way things were?" He asked.</p> <p>"No, I'm sure she would prefer that I just move back to town." I said.</p> <p>"Well the reason I called in, I didn't want to do anything that might make you uncomfortable here. If you feel like going back to town, or you want to move back home from here, I'll understand. If you want to stay here too, sure there is a phone on the wall over there that you can call home or even just hang up." He said.</p> <p>I nodded my head, and he said "Thanks."</p> <p>I followed him back over to where he had been sitting. I looked in and Sarah was still standing by his table. I looked over at her and she was doing the same with her pizza.</p> <p>"It looks like you really enjoyed your food." She said with a smile.</p> <p>"I was nervous." I said with a smile.</p> <p>"Come and sit down." She said</p> <p>Before I could, she jumped up and ran into the kitchen. She came back several minutes later with her pizza and a big smile on her face. She sat down on the edge of the table with her legs dangling over the side. I sat down and started the movie.</p> <p>I was a little sad when she came back. As I watched her stand next to him, he reached out and touched her knee under the table. The waiter came in shortly after and took my order. After ordering, he walked away and left the dishes for her.</p> <p>Sarah sat on the opposite side of the table. I watched them for a couple of minutes. The next part of the movie started. Before the movie was on, they both stood up and started to walk away. I was getting very worried since it sounded like the movie was about to end.</p> <p>"I don't want you to leave." He said.</p> <p>"No, I want to stay and I don't want to go back to some place where I didn't have any options." He said.</p> <p>"Sarah, do you like my apartment?" He asked her.</p> <p>"Sarah, you are a pretty young lady and I don't want you to take advantage of me." She repliedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
