It was almost as though his interest in her was a curiosity. He seemed to be thinking of something he could do to her. In truth, he was in no hurry to get off.</p> <p>“You look incredible. How long has it been?” Cheryl suddenly realised that he wasn’t going to just fuck her anyway. There was no time to think of a reply, she just stood there.</p> <p>“Time?” he asked quietly.</p> <p>“What about you?”</p> <p>“Well, it’s not much; just some clothes, I guess. I didn’t like clothes on the dresser.”</p> <p>The other man was trying to make eye contact, Cheryl thought, he must be looking at her. “You like to fuck me?” she continued, deliberately moving closer to the man, who seemed to be about to object, but Cheryl’s hand found its way to his crotch, she could feel him throbbing. “I mean … well, is all right if you want me to … err … ”</p> <p>The man stood bolt upright, and Cheryl felt him tremble. She tried to pull away, but was unable to. “No, you don’t,” came his words, “Just come with me, I need to talk to you for a minute if you have any problems.”</p> <p>The man reached for Cheryl, and felt her body trembling with fear again. He held her hand, looked her in the eye and said, “Go out and find someone else. You’re more than welcome here I’ll wait by the front till you get home, I promise!” He stood and looked her over, stroking her face and neck, her long hair falling to his waist. "Just go,” he hissed at her, “I’ll give you half an hour to get dressed, then I’ll come to you to get everything off.” He held her hand again and left her, Cheryl feeling terribly frightened, and was afraid to be noticed, but unable to move from where he’d placed her.</p> <p>“What did he mean about something we didn’t take care of?”</p> <p>“Well,” Cheryl had to think quickly, “I suppose I could find something to put on, and I would prefer it if you didn’t have to take that outfit off … would you?” She felt slightly less frightened when the man’s lips brushed hers, then her soft skin, and then something was on her mouth and tongue! And the man was taking off his own clothes!</p> <p>Cheryl almost felt as though she was about to cry. She felt her heart racing and even thought, “What is wrong with me?” She felt scared and excited, but couldn’t make the decision. “It was just a question of finding someone else,” came her reply, and tried to reason,</p> <p>“Why?”</p> <p>“It means that if I had found a way to take it off, I would still be here for a short while! What was it you wanted?"</p> <p>Cheryl looked around at the others in the shop. “I’m not sure what I have … and how you could do this. I mean, I think you have your own life, maybe I can help … maybe I just wanted to be the best wife a man can ask for,” she said with a smile.</p> <p>“Ah,” the voice of the man said, “come on … what was all that about a little threesome again?” In response to his remark, the other man stood up, removed his trousers and, having removed his boxers, stepped forward to push Cheryl to the floor, and onto her back. “Do what you want,” he said with a smile at the man, “it can’t hurt I’m the best I can be.” And without asking for permission again, he placed his hands where Cheryl had found them and pushed them hard against her thighs until he met resistance. Once again, there was no resistance this time. He felt the warmth and dampness of a woman’s vulva through the material of her panties, and, as he pressed his finger hard against her, felt how hard the moisture was now. The sudden, rough feeling was like nothing he had experienced before. He did not have to probe very hard, but he did not have to hold her legs in the same positions as the man.</p> <p>And—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
