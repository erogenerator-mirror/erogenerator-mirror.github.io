"It's your fault I'm here, and I didn't realize it before. I didn't even realize it until now. I'm so fucking sorry," he said as he looked down. "It will kill me." His eyes were filled with tears as her eyes were full of sympathy for him.</p> <p>"Don't cry," she said. "I'm sorry too, but it's not your fault I know how to talk to you. You did what you have to do..." she added in sympathy as she held him by a breast before he could leave. "How do you think I feel about you being the one that lost your friend and family, and you making me so mad...my dad, her brothers, your brothers and cousins...?"</p> <p>He didn't look up at her. This was the first time he hadn't reacted to her anger. He closed his eyes, holding her as she reached out and grabbed hold of him then pulled him against her. Her mouth closed over his and she buried her face into his neck, kissing him hard. He let loose of her and fell to the floor as she got on top of him. Her body was warm and his hands rubbed against her sides and under her top, grabbing her breasts with his left hand and stroking her thigh with his right. He loved just being with her, how she made him feel. He held onto her hips as he ran his hands up and down her sides, feeling her body. He kissed her stomach then moved his fingers down to her ass and around her back.</p> <p>"You're getting hard already." She gasped as she looked down and saw her dick sticking out in front of her and hard as a rock. "How was your class today?" she asked as she ran her hands in her hair making her body look hard and angry.</p> <p>"I was doing well actually," he said, as he ran his hands down her body. "It was great, and I'm glad to be here," he said as he cupped her ass. "Let's go upstairs so I can do what I'm going to do tomorrow."</p> <p>"Okay, fine..." she said as she pushed her body against his as she grabbed his hair. "We can have dinner tomorrow night," she added as she turned his face up with a kiss.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p>That morning they had breakfast together and made their way to the gym. When they were finished, they were walking out of the door, kissing and hugging and she asked him how he came to hate everything about school. He told her it was the first and only time and that made her feel good. They had the gym to ourselves for two or three hours and he wanted her to see how hard it was to be a good student.</p> <p>After she made her way back to his apartment, she wanted him to let loose. He was sitting on the couch with them just having breakfast as did she. They sat around making each other a sandwich and getting high with the energy building inside of them.</p> <p>"Hey, do you remember when I said that the best thing for school was to teach how to play basketball?" he asked her as he rubbed her leg.</p> <p>"Yes" She said, grinning at him as she put down her spoon. She was trying to make his joke and that would be it then.</p> <p>"I'm not kidding about the best thing is making a good boyfriend," She said as she looked over at him.</p> <p>"Good for me," he said with a smile, as he leaned over and took her face in his hands. "Can we do it again soon?"</p> <p>"Not without taking care of you," she said and ran her fingers through his thick hair.</p> <p>"Not yet" he said and then he was kissing her on the cheek as he was before before.</p> <p>They finished their meal together then got in his car to go back home. She looked over at him curiously a couple times and thought about it, what kind of girl was he? Maybe he was just as interested in her as he was in his boyfriend. And she didn't need him as a boyfriend either. He could give him the same kind of attention she just received. She loved him. And it had been so long since he had felt her pain and hurt and missed her. He gave him something of her own and that was something she still had on her mind, but would continue to get it out of him, even if it made the pain a lot more tolerable than the anger he felt that left him wanting to just keep walking into her.</p> <p>She started the car and got out saying "Okay" as she pulled into the nearest and last shopping center. They were walking into the entrance of the parking garage, just walking downâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
