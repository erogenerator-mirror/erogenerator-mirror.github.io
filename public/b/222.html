"Well, I can only hope." He said, taking one finger out of her mouth. "It's not like I usually do. With me." He added with a grin.</p> <p>Jenny smiled at him, and she pulled her hands from under the back of his shirt, slowly unzipped the front of the jeans.</p> <p>Bobby was surprised as she slid the pants and the briefs down with her shoes, and he let out a gasp as she exposed and revealed his rock-hard cock to the cool air. She grinned at him, and then bent down and started licking his stomach as she slid his jeans to his ankles. He sat there grinning as his throbbing boner popped free, her mouth quickly closing around it.</p> <p>"Oh, God..." he moaned as she sucked him, taking some of the pre-cum that had leaked out of him when she kissed up to his cock. She looked up into his eyes, grinned at him in encouragement, then took him inside of her mouth, sliding her lips up and down.</p> <p>Bobby moaned as he watched her. She wasn't too bad, in his eyes, as well as the feel of her tongue and lips as she slid him in and out of her mouth. He ran his fingers through her hair as she bobbed on his cock, and he could feel himself about to come, but she didn't stop. Instead, Jenny bobbed harder and sucked his thick meat even more aggressively, bobbing against him furiously as his legs shook.</p> <p>"That's it," he said as he pulled her head up and looked her in the eyes. "Oh fuck, yeah." He added, grabbing her head as his cock shot a load of cum down her throat. It was so hot to feel her lips wrapped around his dick, but she didn't take it away from her mouth. She sucked him like a vacuum, her lips rubbing against the sides of his throbbing dick as she sucked him.</p> <p>Jenny finally pulled off her boyfriend's dick and looked him in the eye. She couldn't believe how turned on she felt. She'd come to realize that he'd never been much for blowjobs, and it made her feel even more kinky. But somehow, it seemed right at the time. Besides, a blowjob was just as good. "You taste so good," Jenny said, sliding her panties down to her ankles. She smiled at Bobby, who nodded and looked up at her with a smile that didn't reach his face at all.</p> <p>Jenny stood up to get a better look at Bobby. His dick stood up, hard, and proud in front of her. He was still a little tender after coming, but he wasn't in any condition to be in pain. He was clean-shaved, and though he was still a little sore, he wasn't like the rest of his body. Jenny looked down at his cock and he saw that it was semi-erect, so it was pretty limp after jacking off. But, at what looked like half the length, and her hand just barely encompassed it like all the rest of his body.</p> <p>"I'm soo proud of you," she said, taking his hand and pulling him toward the bedroom. "Come on," she said to him, taking his hand in hers and leading him along with her.</p> <p>Bobby smiled back at her, watching her in the reflection in the mirror. She leaned over and he took her cheek in his hand, kissing it tenderly, then nibbling on her ear, and then he kissed his way down to her neck, nipping her skin softly with his teeth. She moaned at that, turning to face away from him as he kissed her neck and shoulder, moving down the side of her body.</p> <p>Bobby moved between her legs then. His fingertips brushed against her pubic hair, teasing her again as he kissed her stomach and thighs. He slipped one finger into her, then two, and then when she lifted her legs to him, he found himself kissing the outside of her sex, then kissing down her thigh and up to her mound, which he planted a kiss upon.</p> <p>Jenny's knees buckled as she felt his cock press closer to her naked vagina. She moaned out loud as he began kissing her inner thighs, and she pressed her knees even harder to him as his lips and tongue pressed closer to her pussy. Her hips began thrusting against his mouth, and he responded by sucking her lips into his mouth and pressing his tongue into her as she began to moan and grind against him.</p> <p>"Oh yeah," she whimpered as he tongued her pussy, licking up her slit, down to her clit. "That's it!"</p> <p>Mentally, she was overwhelmed by the power of her orgasm, a powerful one that shook her body up and downâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
