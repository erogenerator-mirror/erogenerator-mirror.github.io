She loved her vibrator so much it didn't take much from him. Her hips arched up from the bed and she gasped out as a warm wet feeling spread through her body. "Oh god yes! More!" "Oh my god!" "I can feel the fire in your hands!" She kept coming and the vibrations from her hips drove him insane. Her fingers dug into the sheets as her hips bucked and bucked with the intensity from his cock fucking her. He had not even touched her breasts yet. As she felt him start to swell and her juices start to run down to the sheets, she let out a moan.</p> <p>"OH YES! YES! Cumming!" "YES!!" "OH YES! FILL ME UP WITH YOUR CUM!!!"</p> <p>"Oh yeah!" "Make me! I want to feel you fill me up!"</p> <p>At that moment the phone rang which caused her body to convulse in orgasm. She had not wanted to answer it. Her head fell to the bed as she lay with his head on her breasts and her mouth wrapped around his. He was kissing her as the phone continued to ring and her world returned to normal. She could feel his cum running down her legs and she spread them even wider. She had never liked to wear pantyhose because they created lots of resistance against her clit. As he pulled his cock out of her she had it back in as he reached down and pulled her head up and off the bed. He kissed her as they continued to kiss, then told her there was a business call that was needed, but that he would be right back.</p> <p>He left and she knew he would come back later on.</p> <p>"What was the call about?" He asked.</p> <p>"Just a conference call", she replied.</p> <p>"Oh." "But I have to be away for at least an hour then, I have to go straight home."</p> <p>"Well I was thinking maybe we could all come out of that room to the airport." She replied.</p> <p>They were at her hotel and they drove her car and took off. The ride took a little less than five minutes. As they walked in the lobby they each felt a thrill that they could walk out in the back of their car, and it seemed like each of them could be there.</p> <p>"You are gorgeous." He whispered to her as he took her arm and held her in his powerful arms. She looked up at the hotel ceiling. They both got off her car and as she walked to the door to check in, she was surprised at how turned on she was. She had never been with anyone on a plane before and now she felt like she could go out for dinner. She went to her hotel room and called a taxi to get her luggage and she got in bed.</p> <p>She was in bed when she heard him pick up the phone. He told her to stop and had to take a shower. "I can't take it anymore!" she thought to herself. It was so quiet. He picked up the phone and told her "there are a few things that need to be done first."</p> <p>He did not take the shower but she could see his naked body in the shower cubicle. As she watched him she was amazed at everything about him. He was very clean-cut, tall in his twenties, beautiful face, and great body. She couldn't help but notice his black hair and blue eyes. As he came out of the shower, his naked body was much hotter than she thought it would be. They kissed as he held her in his arms. She was so excited at that moment and so aroused she could barely get the words out.</p> <p>With another surprise, the door to the shower opened and he stepped back to rinse his mouth. She looked at him standing in the mirror as he moved toward her. Her eyes locked on his. "Oh my god," she thought as she reached over and touched his arm and let her fingers glide gently over his arm as she pulled away as fast as she could. His eyes told her he wanted her just as much as she did him.</p> <p>Their kisses intensified. His tongue explored her mouth as his hand grabbed her ass and pulled her closer. His lips followed. Soon they were making out passionately, as he grabbed her tits, squeezed and rolled her nipples between his thumb and forefinger. His other hand slid down her stomach to her hot wet pussy, and he felt her legs clench.</p> <p>He had dropped to the bed and she had on her knee length summer dress so she was wearing no panties. He could not believe he was fucking this amazingly pretty coed with her legs wrapped around him. She kissed him as he pushed down on her shoulders.</p> <p>He had never been this forceful and she knew she wanted it. "I want you... I've wanted youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
