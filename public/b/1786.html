He set down his stuff and looked at me expectantly.</p> <p>"Ready?" He said.</p> <p>"Yes," I replied without a beat.</p> <p>I didn't want to do anything stupid or foolish. I wanted to be here with him. I had to be. I didn't want him to think I was the slut or, at the very least, that my mom's boyfriend had fucked me. But I wanted it. Yes, I was excited, but my head was spinning and my eyes were fluttering and looking down at his hands as he started to stand. He started to pull them from the pocket, but I said no and shook my head. I was sure he'd just take my word. I knew he wouldn't do it. He was going to leave me. He looked up at me and I saw his eyes glisten and I knew he was in pain. He was angry and hurt. But I held onto that thought. I had to be here with him. I had to live with the desire, the lust, to live a life full of love.</p> <p>I held my hand out and he took my hand. He held on and stood on the step as I was led away. I was nervous, excited, scared. I felt hands on my hips as he pulled me from the kitchen. I moved closer, almost afraid. I closed my eyes as they seemed to close and I felt his lips brush the side of my face. He leaned in and he kissed me. His lips were soft, a little rough, and I felt his tongue run along my lips and into my mouth. I kissed back and we let our lips dance until we were breathless. I was holding his head in my hands and he looked a little shocked but he didn't push me away. He just stood there and let my arms drop. When they didn't fall he stepped back and looked at me.</p> <p>"God, I'm sorry," he said. "I shouldn't..."</p> <p>He started to say more but stopped. His hand went to the back and he took my face in his hands and wiped away the moisture from my face. He reached down and I felt his cock jerk in his shorts. Instinctively I lifted my hand and he moved his palm around it. He pulled his hand back a little and it was limp. I looked at him and he looked down at me. I had to smile at that and knew that there was no turning back.</p> <p>"Sorry," he said, sounding like a wounded puppy. "I didn't mean to... I mean... I just..." He looked at my hand for a long minute. "I'm sorry," he said again. "I really didn't mean to..." When he looked up again I said nothing, thinking it better that he keep talking this way.</p> <p>He backed me up and he leaned in and he kissed me again, but I was too scared to kiss him back. I kissed him back.</p> <p>"Come with me," he said. "I'll be gentle."</p> <p>He led me up the steps and to the front door.</p> <p>"Wait," he said. "Can we do this somewhere else?" I didn't want to argue. He got a big grin on his face when he saw that. But he wasn't smiling.</p> <p>"You're a little slut," I said, "and you know it!" He nodded. "And I'm sorry, I thought," he shook his head. "I should never have taken you, or anyone else." I could see him looking at me, but he looked so ashamed. "Maybe sometime I'll take you back," he said, and he opened the door for me.</p> <p>I was scared to go, but I was also excited to see him. I walked in and we embraced in my living room and I kissed him. Our arms snaked around each other's waist and I felt his cock against my thigh. That was all I could take. We stood there a moment looking at each other. He started to kiss me and I tried to pull the zipper of his shorts back. I wanted him, but he pulled it back, stepped back and took his clothes off. I knew what was going to happen and I looked up at him. His eyes were shining with lust. He dropped his shorts to the floor and his cock sprang out to see what was going to happen. I walked towards him, and we embraced together and he lifted me by the hand and threw me onto the couch. His lips touched mine and I could feel his cock hard against my thigh. I felt the warm, soft weight of him against me and I felt so wanted. We kissed and I was so turned on. I kept one hand on my hip and the other on his chest. His cock was throbbing against me and I had to hold onto theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
