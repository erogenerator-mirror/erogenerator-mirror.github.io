Her fingers slowly circled her clit, slowly. A light moan escaped her lips as she slowly circled her tongue back and forth over her clit. She felt herself building towards a huge orgasm, and suddenly her moans became louder, her voice filled the room. Her eyes were wide, her mouth gaped open, her hands were clenched tight over her breasts, her head tilted back, her voice vibrated with pleasure with each thrust from her mouth.</p> <p>Suddenly he stopped, his grip on her head loosened. He leaned back to rest against the wall. She stared up at the ceiling, her breath in her hair, her legs splayed, her nipples pointing up to the ceiling. His cock had grown fully erect, standing straight up in the open, and she felt it throb a bit as if it had a life of its own. Then his hand moved towards her body and she found that she was not disappointed. Her hand began moving, her body rocking up and down to meet his. She could feel herself nearing orgasm as his fingers circled her clit before slipping inside.</p> <p>A wave of ecstasy washed over her, her body convulsing around his fingers. They quickly lost track of time, as she rode one wave for another. Her body relaxed on top of him, he remained on top of her, his hands roaming over her body, kneading her breast, stroking her stomach, gently caressing her. Only then did he remove his hands completely. Her arms came up to cover her breasts as she fell away on him. Still on top and completely out in the open she opened her eyes looking at him in the face.</p> <p>He sat upright, lifting her body and laying her on her back. She gazed up at him as he held her in his arms on the couch. She turned slightly, trying to move away, but he only pulled her back onto him. She tried to reach her hand up to stop him, but he held her in place. She felt him push aside her skirt and pulled down his shorts. He was still hard, and very, very thick. She looked up at him and watched as he positioned himself at her entrance, he pushed slowly forward. He moved in a little so she didn't have to adjust her stance, and she moaned loudly as he entered her. They both closed their eyes as their bodies met in unison. He kissed her as he pushed in, slowly, fully. When he got a bit farther, he stopped.</p> <p>“Are you ok,” he asked, his voice was still soft and concerned.</p> <p>“Oh, I am,” she whispered, her head resting against his chest. “Fuck me…oh please,” she moaned again.</p> <p>“Are you sure there’s no pain,” he asked again. She nodded and leaned forward, opening her eyes to see his face over her breasts.</p> <p>They looked at each other for a bit. He smiled a bit then slowly pushed himself into her. With each push she could feel him penetrate her completely. He slowly increased his pace, as he felt her body take on a life of its own. Her head rolled back as she began bucking her hips against his. His cock plunged in and out of her body as he reached the bottom, never slowing.</p> <p>Her body began to shake, and she let out a muffled cry as her orgasm overtook her. He gripped her tight, still pulling her back towards him as he kissed her neck. Finally he lifted her fully off of the floor and set her down in front of him.</p> <p>They embraced as he turned around to lie down on his back, her head hovering above his cock as he slowly began fucking her mouth. Her legs were on one side and he lifted her leg up over his hips and moved to the side of it. She grabbed his cock, stroking him as she sucked on the head. She could feel herself building towards another orgasm.</p> <p>He felt her body tighten, her fingers gripping his cock tightly. He felt her shudder, her body tensing, her mouth full, trying to take him as deep as she could. He thrust more quickly now, the head of his cock pressing hard against the tightness of her throat. He pushed forward once more before she released him, taking the head of his cock into her throat. She gagged slightly before slowly returning it again, feeling her tongue gently dancing around the head.</p> <p>He sat up in the center of the couch, looking down at her. He reached over to turn on the television for a moment, letting his orgasm and her pleasure wash over them—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
