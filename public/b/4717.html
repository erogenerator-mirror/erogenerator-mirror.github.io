I just don't think... I mean..."</p> <p>"Sandra?"</p> <p>"... Yes?"</p> <p>"I was wondering if... that's, if, um... I could do something?"</p> <p>RJ laughed, "Like what?" He grinned broadly, "That's up to what you think."</p> <p>"What? I don't want to do anything. I didn't know..."</p> <p>"Just look at you," he said sympathetically, "I told you your tits would sag. They aren't as big as I remember. I remember you have a good body."</p> <p>I felt the bed sag just a bit as I lay on my side, but Jase turned and kissed me.</p> <p>"You're getting used to me," he said, "All you have to do is take me."</p> <p>"I don't want you to, Jase. It's... it's going to hurt."</p> <p>"Don't worry. I'll take good care of you."</p> <p>"All right," I said, "but what about your dick?"</p> <p>Jase grinned, "Now I'm going to make sure I do your homework with."</p> <p>I stared at him as he knelt between my legs and his pants dropped around his ankles. His erection bobbed proudly in front of him. His eyes were closed as he pushed them together with one hand and took hold of my thighs with the other. He parted my legs with his legs and pressed his hips forward so that the engorged head of his cock parted my wet labia and then sank deep inside me. I was incredibly tight. I couldn't have felt as much pain as I did when I had tried to start. He began to move in and out, then stopped because he didn't want to hurt me. He pushed hard.</p> <p>"No," I said.</p> <p>"Yes?"</p> <p>"No." I bit my lip.</p> <p>He chuckled.</p> <p>"You'll just have to relax, love," he said. "Do you want me inside you or not?"</p> <p>"I need you..." I said. "Just fuck me, Jase."</p> <p>He lifted my hips to get more pressure against me. I closed my eyes and spread my legs. Jase's hands were on my stomach while his movements became faster and deeper. He was pumping in and out. My tits were swinging. I was in a new world now. Jase held my hips. I was on a kind of cloud.</p> <p>I had no idea how long I lay there. I hadn't really paid attention to it until Jase got up and moved on the bed.</p> <p>He reached between my legs and grabbed his cock. He held it still while he held my hips, keeping my pussy muscles relaxed as he brought himself to the tip of his cock. Then he pushed gently and it went in with a long slurp. He continued, his movements becoming a slow push forward. When he was all the way in, his belly bumped my clit. Jase's balls were slapping my ass.</p> <p>The whole sensation was new to both of us and it took its own unique place in my body. I started panting as my body tensed and quivered. I was so close, so close from the inside out.</p> <p>"Jase?"</p> <p>"Yes?" He said.</p> <p>"I thought maybe you'd like to fuck me some more?" I whispered.</p> <p>He grinned. "Hmmm. I think you'd better. You can cum all over me like before."</p> <p>"Okay," I said softly.</p> <p>Jase smiled and began to pump his pelvis with increasing speed. I felt the warm shaft glide in my channel and I felt it moving in my walls. Both of us continued until our bodies were joined in a tight embrace that felt just as good as before. Jase held my hips tight and fucked me. If anything, he seemed to understand the full meaning of the word. I was so full, so very full.</p> <p>"That's it, baby. Fuck that little pussy," he spoke softly.</p> <p>He had stopped and the pace resumed. My hips pushed and my pussy grasped and ungripped him. Jase held himself deep inside. I closed my eyes and enjoyed the feeling. I felt him move slightly and then jerk slightly as his cock throbbed in my channel. When the pace increased, I opened my eyes and looked at him. His look was as concerned as if he was just about to say something about having a heart attack.</p> <p>"Jase," I whispered, "I want it."</p> <p>"Oh," he said. "Say it."</p> <p>"I want you inside me, Jase."</p> <p>He began his slow strokes again, "What?"</p> <p>"Tell me what you want, Jase."</p> <p>"I want you to fuckâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
