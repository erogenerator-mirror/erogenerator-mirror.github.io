The words were out loud and as though they were spoken in a trance. It was the sound that I had heard before, the sound I was trying to make the connection between us between us. She moved her hands to my shoulders and she pushed me back and pulled herself around my body and onto mine. We went in for the kiss, there was the long kiss and the light on my face, it was a light kiss. It wasn't a kiss to be sweet and caring, it was the kiss of possession, submission, and the possession not just of my body, but the whole of it that I am not. As we kissed, my hands began to roam over her body and I caressed her skin, the heat of her skin, up and down its length, I could feel the softness of her breasts through our clothes and she could feel my growing hardness, I wanted to explore her body and I wanted to make it mine, it was a desire that I had felt for over a decade before now. I felt her hands, then, on my hips, I felt the heat of her finger tips against my cheeks.</p> <p>When we broke it long enough, I saw that she had removed the button of my shirt and the moment it was free she had taken it off and the buttons were flying up and down so quickly that it took every ounce of strength I know not even me to keep them up. When she slid her hand over my chest I was surprised that I had the sense to keep them up so that she could be naked in the open and I couldn't have done so but with my arms still cuffed behind me I could not reach up and untie her, it would be too much trouble. We continued to kiss and I was having a hard time making her go back to what she had started.</p> <p>When she slid off me and onto the bed I was disappointed, but also relieved that it could be done, to be free once and for all, without fear of the consequences. As soon as I could move myself she was on the bed, it took me a few seconds to get my arms free, she lay on her back, her breasts were still soft and the nipples that had been hard only moments before were a little swollen now; I could smell her, her body was soft and inviting, and her lips were red and swollen and inviting. I was still a bit shaken and confused and I didn't know what had happened, I certainly didn't know that she had allowed herself to pleasure me as I had her. When she did it she used her hands and mouth to bring me to new heights, I almost passed out, it was as though she became a goddess in the night; the desire, the desire to be fucked is just another word. It was a hunger that I was not used to when women did that, I didn't know where all the "right thing" to try might lead.</p> <p>When we finally caught our breath, I could move my hands and she was still there, her body was waiting for me and she waited for it, she pulled me onto her, our lips and tongues met again, and the kiss continued; the kiss was as soft and sweet as it had been the night before and her hands caressed my chest and I caressed her, and we kissed even more, her nipples and areolas seemed to get more sensitive as she was pressing into me. When she did kiss my mouth, my tongue slipped between hers when the kiss ended it was a longer kiss, longer and more intense and we had to fight from kissing her all the way through.</p> <p>We finished kissing and she went to the night stand and got a large bottle of Astroglide she always kept in bed for special occasions, she had never used it since we had been married in college, but this time it seemed perfect. I pulled and undid the cuffs on my arms, she stood and I went and got her a new pair of shorts and shirt, as I put them on she sat on her bed and I picked up my own clothes from the floor. "You're a man of God" she said as she sat with her back against her head board. I didn't know what to say as I stood beside her.</p> <p>We began to talk and our words were soft and intimate as we talked about this and that and about when we should do this again; we were never done talking; we never had any trouble speaking, she told me that she had never really enjoyed a serious affair nor did I. I told her that when I was married I never did anything, I don't feel guilty or ashamed of that one night or anything like that, all I felt was that as far as love was concerned, maybe that is what this was aboutâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
