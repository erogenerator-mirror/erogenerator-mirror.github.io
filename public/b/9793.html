He pulled his finger from her body and then slid his finger down her back until it was in the crack of her ass. She moaned as he pushed in two finger inside her. He took his finger out of her and then positioned her hips. Now, she was on her back with his cock standing upright in front of her face. He slipped a third finger inside her and she cooed. He put his cock just outside her pussy lips and she grabbed two handfuls of his hair.</p> <p>"Oh yes!" she cried. "Do me!" he said, and leaned forward until his cock was at her opening. She spread her legs so he'd enter her. As he entered her, the warmth and pleasure she felt overwhelmed her again as his cock filled her to capacity. He slowly pumped into her and she was overwhelmed again when he began to fuck her. He reached inside her and rubbed his finger against her clit. They both gasped as the dual sensations of pleasure and pain exploded within her.</p> <p>"Aieegh!" she cried as she climaxed once more.</p> <p>She could feel how wet he had made her. She felt his cock slip from her body as he fell forward on the bed next to her. She could feel the cool air rushing in through the open window. They lay in each other arms, neither of them wanting to move. After she caught her breath, she pulled his hand around so they could feel the length of his shaft. Her other hand reached down and played with his balls.</p> <p>"Mmmm," she sighed as her hand circled his shaft.</p> <p>"It's been so long," he said, kissing her and running his finger over her clit once more.</p> <p>They kissed and touched each other as time stood still. After thirty minutes passed, they both drifted back to reality.</p> <p>********</p> <p>The next day, they met on the couch as the sun was setting. John kissed her softly, and then said, "So, you're going to make something of yourself," as he pulled her down onto the couch with him.</p> <p>"Yeah?" she said as she straddled him.</p> <p>"Yeah," he told her, and she kissed his neck before kissing his lips. "Will you help me out here?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess," she answered. She then sat on his cock as she rubbed it up and down. She leaned in and kissed his other nostril. She then rubbed the head of his cock with her pussy until they were both covered in his saliva. Then she sat up again and kissed him.</p> <p>"What?" she asked, "How do you know that I'm not going to let you fuck me?"</p> <p>"I've got some condoms in there. Here," he said as he handed her the package. She pulled them out quickly and tossed them to him before slipping her panties off and getting into the bathroom. She checked that everything looked good, flushed, clean, and dressed. Then she checked his watch. "There's a lot more time and I'm going to be late."</p> <p>"You're on schedule?" John asked.</p> <p>"Yes, but you don't have to be early tomorrow so you can take your car." She smiled at him and then winked at him before pulling on her pantiesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
