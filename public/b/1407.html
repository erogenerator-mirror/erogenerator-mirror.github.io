Each step she took took her mind away. There seemed to be so much to be in her heart. She was never quite sure what to call it. At one point she had thought of calling it something other than mother, father, and husband.</p> <p>Now it was more of more than that, or perhaps even more. There were other words but not for her.</p> <p>"Do I have to spell it out? Will you please just get on with it? It's not important now. It just needs more attention."</p> <p>She watched the way he was smiling as if she had just been standing at the sink, his eyes locked on her. The way he was smiling at her, her nipples were hard and pouting against her dress, her skirt was fluttering against her bottom, and her hips were swaying side to side as if she was dancing. She wanted to hold on to those thoughts but held on too well.</p> <p>"I can't just yet, I'm a grown up. You can't just walk up and say I'm your little bitch."</p> <p>He chuckled "That's not true, it's really just me. Your little bitch. I have more to show you."</p> <p>Sighing she felt like a ball of nerves and she wanted to do something but couldn't.</p> <p>"There is one more thing..." he said in a voice that she had never heard before which made her stomach twist and her whole body tingle.</p> <p>"What exactly is that?" Her voice was weak.</p> <p>His face came close enough to hers to touch but didn't. "There are things I am not going to do without, or say I won't do without. I need to be in control, it is not my choice but my choice to take control. It is only going to happen when you truly are mine to command."</p> <p>The man's eyes met hers as he paused again "and it will be in front of you when you are allowed to do that."</p> <p>He took her hand and walked over to the small side table on the other side of the room and got out the chair that had always served him. Leaning forward he took her hand and laid down his palm before taking her hand again. A soft smile played on his lips and he gently touched her hand.</p> <p>"The first thing you MUST do is do something for me. You're going to do a little shopping, pick up the ingredients for your special meal."</p> <p>His lips brushed her fingers again and again, "Oh god." She could barely breathe but his touch seemed to make everything else feel like it really was a dream. So that was it, she thought. It was as if being in the hospital had been a part of her life forever.</p> <p>He placed her hand once again on his lap and gently ran his thumb across her thumb then lifted it to his nose. His eyes seemed to say something but hers were just a bit bigger. "You need to be able to make decisions for your own selfish reason. You have to learn to live with your own desire, not to just the simple things like that. Don't you want to experience each and every new thing you might encounter with your Master?"</p> <p>He looked at her with those eyes once again. His eyes were dark with want.</p> <p>"There is one more thing. My name is Adam. I am your Master, Mistress. If you want I will tell you I am no longer using the name of your Master. Your life depends on my taking ownership." That last sentence almost made her stomach turn, but she couldn't bring herself to speak.</p> <p>He looked into her eyes then laughed. "I guess now would be a good time for you to have a chance to be able to do the same. As my new slave your life depends on it. We are a group and that is what we are going to be. It will continue to be a group. You are here because I have decided to give you my blessing to play with your little friends. It is a sign of respect to me that you are going to have to serve me. When you are ready and ready, come to me. This is your chance. If you cannot perform, if I decide otherwise we will leave your home and move somewhere far away. Don't worry. I would not be cruel in that regard. I'm not going to do anything like that."</p> <p>He took a sip of his drink while looking her over. He didn't smile but that didn't make him any less of a man. "Now, I want to go. The food is on the table. You can stay and eat. If you want to try and make me feel like a man what am I to do?"</p> <p>She bit her lip as she thought of saying yes and getting out of thereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
