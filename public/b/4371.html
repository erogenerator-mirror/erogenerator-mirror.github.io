The plan was that they would have cocktails and dinner at the Hotel Bar Bar that night, then leave to go to their homes. They both knew that it was going to be one of a lifetime. Their plan worked and they would go for a drive and then go to bed. With little more than a word to say, there was a knock at the door.</p> <p>They stepped out of the restaurant hand in hand. They kissed each one as the elevator descended. Each one took a key and they were led into the Hotel Bar. The bartender smiled as he surveyed the room. He was in his early 50's but still looked strong. He had a good build and always looked sexy even though he was in such a suit. And his red hair and green eyes made him look like an older version of the classic Jack Nicholson type.</p> <p>The bartender took their drinks while he surveyed the suite. It was impressive and the man of few words could describe it.</p> <p>"Room service has delivered everything to your room tonight."</p> <p>He extended his hand. He was older than any man they had ever met in their life. It seemed agey, old money but as his smile broadened he was obviously quite worldly. He looked them over and smiled again.</p> <p>"You too, you little minx!"</p> <p>He was wearing an off white button-down shirt under a black polo. It looked like a black business shirt. It was almost like a business suit. The shirt clung to his firm body and the bulge of his chest was almost to impossible to ignore. As good looking as the man was, the shirt was so tight that the outline of his pecs was clearly visible. But the contrast between the two colors meant that the man looked older than the two people in the room. And as they sat down in the bar he moved his fingers to his chin and caressed it.</p> <p>"It's a surprise!" His voice carried with it's authority the fact that he spoke in such a manner.</p> <p>He had a way of making every bit as much of a statement as they did. He was a distinguished looking man, in good shape, dressed in a business suit. He also looked younger somehow or more sophisticated. There was not a trace of arrogance or entitlement or anything like that. He was clearly trying to establish his place.</p> <p>She looked at the man sitting with her. She was dressed in a very formal business dress. It was a very professional white dress jacket with the top buttoned to the throat. A tailored suit with gray wool cap, with black silk tie on the lapel. She looked at him and smiled in a most sultry way.</p> <p>"Very nice, very nice!" She purred. "You are looking very handsome."</p> <p>"Thank you." He stood up and offered her his hand. She took it gently and walked him to the front of the bar where they both started to loosen up. They had to take their champagne glasses out and hand them over and say something else in the bar before they would begin to get up. They both raised their glasses to each other and they smiled.</p> <p>The bartender had been watching the entire process. He was sitting there looking through the bar as they sat down talking with their mouths almost touching. He turned out to not even look up or come up. He was simply enjoying his moment. There was an air of class and confidence on him that belied his age. There was also a confidence that he had over the years.</p> <p>"Did you see that man!"</p> <p>She had thought he was the man in front of them; he didn't even look up or come up to acknowledge his existence. If she had any questions, she would ask his name.</p> <p>"Oh, my." She thought she had spoken loudly enough he would hear.</p> <p>"It was absolutely marvelous. How are you this fine?" Her eyes roamed around the bar.</p> <p>A couple of them were talking to each other. She had to turn to look at him, she really wanted to be with him. But she just couldn't.</p> <p>She heard him gasp as she came back from the bar, "You must be kidding me!" He gave her an annoyed look.</p> <p>"Nope. I really should get back to mine. If we start drinking again, I won't be able to keep from laughing!"</p> <p>Then it was just a matter of time before they were both talking to them again and he would talk to them a few moments longer, when he knew they would be alone. Sometimes, the more he thought of it, the more he liked it. He saw the look of lust in her eyes when he mentioned that he and her would be alone. He saw some part of her mind that saw what he saw and that she was enjoying theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
