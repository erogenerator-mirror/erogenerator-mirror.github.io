I had no idea where all this was coming from or what they were talking about.</p> <p>About a week later I got a text. "Just thinking of how nice it is to meet you," it said. "We're going to the beach!"</p> <p>The next day I made it a point to come visit the house before they went off to their jobs.</p> <p>We hit the beach a few minutes later, and it was fun. The guys kept trying to find spots, and we ended up lying with our arms around each other.</p> <p>"Can we stop for a moment?" Jason asked.</p> <p>They stopped, and I said, "Let me see what we have." They all laughed. "We have sunblock," I said. I laid my cheek on Jason's thigh and started to do some circles to his body. I moved around from side to side, doing my part as the guys had done many times. I really was getting to work on his back.</p> <p>As I finished his back I reached around and began to unbutton his shorts. Jason was now in the moon light for a moment and I just let my hands slide down his body.</p> <p>He turned his head as I reached around his body and our lips met. Both of us were surprised at our willingness to do this, but we just went with it. I could feel the heat of our bodies and it was obvious that Jason had been affected as much by this as mine. I began to kiss Jason's ear while I continued to play with his erection, and he finally rolled over and pulled his shorts off.</p> <p>He took my hand and put it on his erection and I could feel it through his pants. I pushed a little harder, and Jason got the idea and took my hand off him. They were both rock hard now and I took them into my mouth.</p> <p>I went lower and kissed Jason on the cheek. I reached down and began to play with his sac and penis. He had the same reaction and reached down and held my head and pulled me up, putting his penis into my mouth. I licked his shaft, and sucked on the testicles as he played with my dick. I began to suck Jason with much enthusiasm. He knew what I was doing and he moved down until his nose was right by my pubes.</p> <p>I began to lightly lick the underside of Jason's penis as, he kept saying, "Oh, yeah." I could see that he was getting excited at what I was doing. It was obvious that I was going to get my first blow job and it just kept getting better. Jason just moved his hips a little, and I licked his ball sac. His dick was sticking straight up, fully erect now. I ran my tongue around it and started to rub his cock all over my lips. Jason began making slight moaning noises as I felt him get closer and closer to coming. My cock was dripping with precum, and I was hoping it would get a good licking soon. It was actually kind of exciting being so close to doing anything.</p> <p>Jason's dick reached the back of my mouth and was going to shoot a lot of his spunk into me but I backed off and just gently kissed his shaft, getting it to relax a little. He seemed to like it so I backed off and licked his dick some more, and it was all good to go but something had to come up.</p> <p>He lifted my shirt off and began to rub my naked back. I looked at him and said, "Let me return the favor."</p> <p>"You've been teasing me a bit," he said, "and maybe I should let you continue."</p> <p>"I have something else in mind," I said, "but you've teased me enough."</p> <p>"Really?" he asked. "I was going to let you have my pussy too."</p> <p>"Good Lord, no way," I thought to myself and I started to roll off him and he pulled his dick away from my body.</p> <p>He went and knelt next to me on the blanket. "Let's get these things off," he said and he undid my shorts and began to rub his hands all over my body. When i began to feel the chill of the water he asked "Let's take these off," and he took one of my feet in his hand and led me back to the blanket.</p> <p>I had already removed my shirt while I was lying next to him, so I let him undress me, and I lay down on my back and he began to kiss my neck and nibble on my earlobes. He moved down across my breasts and began to take off my shorts, taking them off with one quick motion. I lifted my headâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
