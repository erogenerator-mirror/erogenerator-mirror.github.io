I turned to see my mom pulling her long auburn locks out of her face.</p> <p>“Oh! Hi honey.”</p> <p>I knew she had been crying when she looked down at the floor between us. I was so happy for her that she did not react at all.</p> <p>“It’s okay, Mom!”</p> <p>Mom was leaning up against me as we were getting in the shower, with a half smile on her face. Mom wiped her eyes and the hair off her brow. She was just looking at me as she did so.</p> <p>“It was very nice, Mom. It really means a lot to me to see you like this with someone.”</p> <p>She lifted her leg and lifted my leg up. I pulled my own leg up to my chest and put my foot on the tile under the shower. I put my other foot into the water. I turned to the side and faced away from her. I put my hands under my arms and pulled my feet toward me. Her hands were still on my legs as she was facing me in the shower. She took my hand again and said,</p> <p>“It was very nice for you too, Mark.”</p> <p>She pulled her leg back off my other leg and kissed it, firstly on the cheek, and secondly on the lips, on the fingers that were still holding my hands.</p> <p>“Thank you, Mom!” I turned my head to see her as we kissed this time. Her lips were so soft and warm and the way their lips and tongue touched it made me feel like a man.</p> <p>We got out of the shower, wrapped ourselves in towels and dried off. I turned my back to her as she turned to dry her hair. I was drying mine and it felt good as much as having her hand on my back when we got out of the bathroom.</p> <p>We got on the bed and snuggled together as we hugged. I kissed my mother on the forehead and on her lips. I kissed the nape of her neck as I pulled out her nightgown. My mother kissed me the same way that I had hers. Then I licked my mother’s ear.</p> <p>“Oh Mark, what are you doing to me? It does not feel good to do that.”</p> <p>I moved up her neck and kissed her there, again right below her ear lobe.</p> <p>“I'm sorry, Mom!”</p> <p>“Oh! What is it honey? Do you want me to take a shower with you?”</p> <p>“You can if you want, but I really do not know how to do it without you,” she said quickly.</p> <p>I moved up her body to kiss her again, but this time very passionately. I let my tongue travel down her chin and down her throat. When it was at the hollow in her throat just at the base of her sternum, I softly bit her there. She gasped and arched her back a little, but then let go of my head.</p> <p>I moved down her body again. I kissed the area below her throat and licked it, as I had done with hers once when we had been kissing a long time ago. Once again she caught her breath as my tongue caressed her there. I got to her nipple and did what I had done with mine. Then, I moved down to the other one. Mom took both nipple in her hands and squeezed them. She leaned her head back and pushed her hips against me, making me know that I was pleasing her.</p> <p>My mother was breathing heavily and I continued exploring her body with my tongue. I moved from her breasts to her neck, and then to her lips again. Her hips and hands moved up to meet mine. I kissed the corner of her lips. They were so full and soft. I loved kissing them, the way they turned us both on. It made us feel like the most wonderful thing in the world. I could have continued kissing her for hours, but knew that time was tight.</p> <p>I kissed up her forehead and looked into her eyes once more. She was beautiful. She had her eyes closed and her forehead and her upper lip were open. I could see the top of her dark hair lying down her body.</p> <p>“Mmm, Mom, you are so very beautiful.”</p> <p>I placed my hand on her breast and caressed the tender skin in her areola. I could see her nipples hard against the wetness of my tongue. They were very nice. I ran my tongue around the top and it tickled her. I sucked it into my mouth and teased her with my tongue. I kissed—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
