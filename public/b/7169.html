She laughed. "Oh, I must admit, it's nice to have someone who can still hold my hand."</p> <p>"Yeah. He can," Emily smiled, patting me lightly on the shoulder.</p> <p>"Well anyway, I must say no one could take it for granted." I laughed. "I mean, after this morning, I'm not so sure I do."</p> <p>Emily's body tensed as I squeezed her hand and kissed her, pressing my lips firmly to hers. She opened her mouth and our tongues danced, their bodies rubbing against each other as we kissed, my hands running from her waist, up her back, across her shoulders to her neck.</p> <p>Pulling away, we gazed into each other's eyes.</p> <p>"It's been a long time," I whispered.</p> <p>Emily looked over at me.</p> <p>"Too, I guess." She kissed me lightly again. "It's going to be better if we just stay close to each other and keep going like this."</p> <p>I squeezed her tightly.</p> <p>"Oh my," I answered. "I don't want that."</p> <p>We slowly broke the kiss, staring into each others' eyes.</p> <p>"Well, I know you would," Emily sighed. "I'm glad you came."</p> <p>I could see her cheeks flush as she glanced at his cock that was growing hard at our closeness.</p> <p>"Yeah," I added. "It was nice talking to you too. Come and get me tomorrow, before the plane leaves the ground."</p> <p>Emily's hand slipped down to my cock and stroked it lightly. She kissed me softly, then led my hand to her hip as she pulled me up. I kissed her neck, my hands reaching forward to cup a breast.</p> <p>"Oooookayyy...," Emily purred. "I'm getting a little warm."</p> <p>"Me too," I added, pulling her against me. I reached around to squeeze her ass as we kissed, feeling her tremble under my touch.</p> <p>"Oh honey, that feels so good," Emily murmured, leaning back into me. "You're just making me all warm and cozy...that was incredible."</p> <p>"It was the best I've ever felt," I laughed. "I've never come so hard in my entire life."</p> <p>We kissed again and I squeezed her ass even more, feeling the taut muscle tighten under my fingers. She pressed back into me, her arms wrapping around my shoulders as we continued to kiss.</p> <p>"I need to get the rest of my things off and get our shower before the sun goes down," she whispered. "Before we do anything more...I want you to fuck me."</p> <p>"I like that," I whispered back, not needing to finish my sentence.</p> <p>I kissed her again and stood, pulling my clothes off as I did. Emily sat up on one half of the sofa as I did.</p> <p>"Oh, I have to go," she said, sitting against the back. We were both still naked.</p> <p>"I won't be long," I said, giving us each a quick peck on the cheek.</p> <p>"But I don't want to wait much longer," she added as I turned to walk toward the front of the apartment. "Oh, and...you can come too."</p> <p>"Absolutely!" I exclaimed, not believing I had just said that to her. She smiled and gave me that sexy, naughty look again.</p> <p>"I don't want us going to that store again either." She winked at me, then laughed as I started walking toward Jim's door.</p> <p>"Oh wait, I did." Emily giggled at me, reaching to wrap her fingers around my cock. "I don't know how much longer I can wait."</p> <p>"And, I don't think I'll be able to wait much longer either." I said wickedly. "Besides, you haven't been going out for long."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm going to be late, honey," she pouted. "I think I'd like to catch a movie. You wanna go to the theater with me or do you want to go out to dinner?" "A movie?" I asked.</p> <p>"Come on," she said, getting up to grab my hand. "I'm not going to argue. I'm not interested in getting into a car. I think I'll go to one of the other places for a movie now and tell the driver where we're going and we'll do it after we get dressed."</p> <p>I nodded and followed Emily out into the kitchen where her purse and a half dozen papers lay on the counter and there were also the two small cups of coffee they use to make coffee.
