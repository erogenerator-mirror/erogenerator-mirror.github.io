I quickly grabbed my keys and walked towards them, opening the passenger side door. As we were about to climb into my car, a dark haired girl leaned over to put on a radio and started to sing a song.</p> <p>"I can't believe I was watching you in my dreams; the way you looked sitting on the blanket; the way you walked back to me, how your thighs were moving around for me, how your breasts swayed back and forth; was it a dream or an actual memory of the way I felt when I was with you."</p> <p>I had to admit that it was a bit of a fantasy, and I was actually excited to have a woman in my car with her talking about it while she was in my dream state. My first thought was what was it would be like if she were a total stranger. It then dawned on me that she wanted to be in my dream state too, like me. After a brief look around and some minor gasps on the road, she stood up and said to me, "I think the next song will work the same way." Then she turned to the stereo and put the music on as she ran back towards me.</p> <p>After a couple of minutes of watching her dance, we realized that she had walked up to the front of my car and was about to open the door. She looked over at me and said, "I'm sorry to keep getting so carried away, but I love to dance." Then she leaned in and put her hands on my cheeks and pulled me close and gave me a kiss on the lips.</p> <p>"It was very nice. Is that how you would like me?" she said as she pulled me behind the passenger side door with her, my cock rising out of my pants. I could feel her breast rub against my back.</p> <p>"I think we should head over to my place where we can dance naked," she said as she pulled back my truck and got in the driver's side of my car, taking the lead. I had to reach around and take her breast in my hand again. We headed over to my house, and I couldn't help but wonder if maybe we were actually going to have sex in my dream. A few more minutes of driving, and I was ready for her.</p> <p>We got to my house and I parked the car and walked around to the back of the house, opened the front door and walked in.</p> <p>"Come in, I'll show you to your room and then we can leave." She said as she was leading the way.</p> <p>I took a look around the home, which was quite comfortable and had a nice view of the backyard. I followed her up the hallway, the light of the Christmas tree twirling into her hair. "I just hope we don't come down with something," she said as she closed the door and locked the door.</p> <p>"No," I said, "I don't think the bed and all that is here is for us."</p> <p>"Well, let's start off naked, shall we?" she said as she went over to stand next to the bed, "I'll undress and you can join me."</p> <p>I stripped down to my favorite black thong. As I sat on the end of the bed, I pulled her to me and gently pulled her down on the bed. We both were now lying on our backs. "I think I'd like to feel your bare breasts against mine," I said as I reached around and started to tweak her nipples.</p> <p>She quickly pulled away from me, "Just pull the covers back and we'll get there."</p> <p>Once the covers were back, I laid back down beside her, pulling her down on top of me, giving me a chance to kiss her as I reached down to stroke her pussy. "Is this what you want?" I asked, "This is all for you." I heard her breath in and out rapidly. "Oh yes, I need you," she cried. "I need you tonight," she said as she broke from my lips and kissed me as her hands moved down my body to my cock. She reached between us and lightly put her hand around it, stroking it while she kissed my mouth hungrily. She leaned up and began kissing me as I continued to stroke her pussy, slowly exploring the softness of her lips and sliding her tongue into my mouth. She lifted her body slightly, and I could feel her hands pushing me back to lie on my back as she took me between her breasts and guided it between them. I could feel her hard nipples between my fingers as she moved them, feeling herself, and then she moved herself back up to get underneath me. I took each of her nipples between my finger and thumb and rolled them around slightly for her. She began moving her hips back and forth, meeting my strokes whenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
