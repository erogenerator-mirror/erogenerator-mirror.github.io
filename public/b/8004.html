"It's after midnight now."</p> <p>"I guess you didn't get much sleep last night," she said. We shared an awkward smile.</p> <p>"I know," I said with a laugh, "and I'm glad we can spend a quiet night together."</p> <p>"We could talk in the car," she said. "I can tell you about the most amazing life you'd ever lived."</p> <p>"So I'll go get laid," I said.</p> <p>"I'd like to, if you want, but I don't really have any plans... I'm staying with my folks."</p> <p>This seemed very promising. She was looking at me closely and I could feel myself blushing. I was surprised that I still felt attracted to her, but I couldn't bring myself to act it out. This was a new experience for me, something I'd never done before.</p> <p>"You know, if you like or want another man, I'd like to do that again when we're not at home," she said.</p> <p>I was almost sure that I was nodding off when she said it. I could feel something inside her. I guess that's what being with Susan had done for me. The woman I had been attracted so deeply, so deeply within, had somehow turned off and abandoned my attraction to women.</p> <p>"That's just one of my many qualities," she added, as I felt her foot brush my leg again.</p> <p>We stood there in silence for a moment, watching each other's expressions. Finally she took my hand in hers and slowly guided my hand to rest on her shoulder. We stood there for quite a few moments before she looked me in the eye, "I'm not exactly ready to do it, but I want you to know it's my decision."</p> <p>"I know," I said. "Don't worry, I won't judge you and I will see if I can do it, if not at the beach."</p> <p>As we left the house we both realized that we were not exactly sure what each other wanted, but we could make decisions together on it. There was still a lot of unresolved tension between us.</p> <p>We got back to the beach house and just about everything was cleaned up. She told me that her folks would be home soon and that we had to go into the house and make dinner. We both had something to say. She had no sense that we would actually do it, but as soon as I walked back into the house she had some things she wanted to say.</p> <p>"We have a lot to discuss," I said.</p> <p>"I'm not sure how to start," she said.</p> <p>"First of all," I said, "I know this can be awkward."</p> <p>"I want to tell you that I'm not attracted to sex, not in the way that most people would think. I just don't know what people would be doing if we did it again."</p> <p>"Well... I mean you'd be doing it with your mom," I said, "and I'm sure with some of your other boyfriends.</p> <p>The idea of seeing someone else fuck and cum made me feel good, but she said that she didn't think it was cheating.</p> <p>"I know what would be cheating is cheating, but you can tell them."</p> <p>"I don't know..."</p> <p>"Let me give you some tips," I said.</p> <p>"Really? So I can be honest and tell you?"</p> <p>I was surprised that she was hesitant to tell me more. I couldn't just tell her everything, especially if she was a total virgin. "Sure."</p> <p>"What do you think you and I want when it's over? Will it be like we have tonight?"</p> <p>"I think we might actually be okay with that," I said.</p> <p>"Okay," she said. "So how long might it be?"</p> <p>"It depends," I said. "How much I can take."</p> <p>"No..." she said. "For every one we get, let's just take the next few days and enjoy what we have."</p> <p>"I agree," I said with a laugh.</p> <p>She was smiling and said, "But I really want it to be like last night. I think we could enjoy it, and I do want to have more than just a casual sex."</p> <p>"But I'm not sure how good you taste or that we should taste," I said.</p> <p>"We can explore it," she said. "Remember, I've been with several guys before. I've never done this."</p> <p>"I remember, but why have you kept on sucking me like you did with your girlfriends?"</p> <p>Again, she laughed.
