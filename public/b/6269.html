No!"</p> <p>"No! No!"</p> <p>"No! No!" He said again, and that wasn't going to be a problem for either of us. We were going to need our mouths, to be sucked. So I did and then I felt it. That first sensation of his lips and tongue on my clit. So I spread apart my legs and he went to town on my pussy.</p> <p>I could swear he was sucking the sweet nectar from my pussy. I'm not sure whether it really was, or whether my body responded in any way, but he seemed to know when to stop. I found out later when he moved his mouth over my breast, and I gasped.</p> <p>I guess he noticed that as I was getting wet. And so he didn't stop and instead made me cum so hard he had to hold our mouths together. If I could stand it, I could have squirted any second.</p> <p>But it was not over. I wanted more, I wanted his tongue and mouth and he wanted the same thing. It was like someone was being born to be on that bed, I was so close.</p> <p>He broke away. "Not so fast," he said, "we have plenty of time!"</p> <p>I smiled and lay down on his bed. As before, I knew by the way his body looked for the next moment that we were going to make a very, very passionate love. He was a gentleman. No problem. I just lay there for a minute waiting for him to move his body to mine, and then I slipped my nightdress off.</p> <p>I loved the way his body looked. The way his legs looked and how they moved to take me in. I wanted to touch him even more now.</p> <p>I was just pulling a bed-cover over us when his hand slid down between us and he touched my pussy through the thin fabric of my thong. It felt heavenly. He took off the panties and I pulled my knees up toward my chest. This was a first for me to be touching a man again. He rubbed me while we went on the bed and I couldn't believe it.</p> <p>He pulled up my nightdress and I lifted my bottom so he could pull it off. I pulled my legs up so I could lay down on my side, so it fell over one of my breasts. He didn't need any encouragement. He kissed me and slid one finger inside me. I gasped and shivered. He kissed me again and then I spread my legs and he slowly moved himself down so he could see me.</p> <p>I was just getting warmed up by him and by what he was doing to me. I reached down and helped him. He took his head and moved his face up and started to kiss me all over again. It felt wonderful and I knew I couldn't last any more before I shuddered.</p> <p>I came with an intensity that surprised me, I felt like I'd cum all night long. Oh, I needed that so badly.</p> <p>He got up and straddled my hips with his. He put that huge cock in me and held me close to him. "I'll tell you what will happen if we get carried away," he said. "Just think how good it will feel when we finally make it to this point, you know?"</p> <p>I knew and he loved to hear it. We both knew.</p> <p>I nodded.</p> <p>"Good," he said as he moved back. "Now I want you on your back with me inside you."</p> <p>He reached down and moved the side of my head to one side so I could see.</p> <p>"Do you like having cock inside you?" he asked me. "Do you like it hard and thick? If you do like it hard and thick then by all means, get ready."</p> <p>I couldn't answer because that was all I could think of. But I was thinking about what that "hard and thick" would feel like. It sounded like an understatement. He took his big, luscious black cock in his hand and looked down at me as it slid inside me. I could have let it go forever, he was such a beautiful man and it seemed like ages to me before I felt his thick, black shaft pressing into me.</p> <p>And then we got it going.</p> <p>In a second I was being screwed. Oh, it felt wonderful feeling that cock inside me. It felt different. Different from just the other day, the way he and some other guys had fucked me and he had fucked me with his big black cock.</p> <p>I had never had two men at the same time before and both of them were very different. No, I didn't want to be that way, but somehow it seemed the only way. It seemed to make me feel loved.
