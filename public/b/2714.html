I also knew that when she came I was going to cum in her. So I told her I was going to cum in her and she said she was going to see which was a big decision. So I told her she should let me cum in her, but she quickly lowered herself again and I came deep in her. She felt me cumming but kept sucking me until I had softened and she had sucked it all down.</p> <p>I got up and went back to my office and waited for her. I was thinking about everything that had happened and wondering what kind of a turn on it would be to let some stranger have her. As I thought about her next visit and how much more I would enjoy it she said it was no more than we were doing. She would be able to come to my house with me and fuck me at her regular time.</p> <p>So here it is, finally, finally!</p> <p>After the visit I knew I had to meet her. With all I had learned from her in two weeks I was not going to back out now unless she got me. As I was thinking about it with trepidation I was still unsure about what to do and if she wanted to do anything with me. After the second time I would not make a big scene but the reality was that I wanted more than anything just for her to be with me. I didn't want her to feel that she was being cheap by telling her she did what she felt she did.</p> <p>So I finally decided I would try to talk to her and see what happened. I knew I couldn't turn her down; but I also didn't want to scare her off.</p> <p>As I came back to my office after lunch I heard her car pull up and then the front door slammed. It was 10 a.m. and I had a few things to do. All I knew was that it felt good to be with a woman and that this would be one of the best days of my life.</p> <p>When I walked into the office it was empty as I expected. Since then I have not been out of the office for more than a hour or two. I was surprised to find her sitting on the sofa sipping coffee but she didn't look upset at all and she was looking at me intently.</p> <p>"Hello," she said quietly. "My name is Kathy, how are you?"</p> <p>"Yes," I answered, "My name is Jason and you must be the one that came calling this afternoon."</p> <p>"Yes, I am," she replied. "Jason just told me that you told him to go with me and get a massage. He told me he was going to love doing my massage. I wondered if he did it for you too, so to speak but I had no doubts about what you meant to him. Besides that's not really what he told me either."</p> <p>I could feel the familiar heat between my legs and it gave me a shiver. The excitement and excitement that we had been playing with had now gone.</p> <p>"What do you do?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'm a massage therapist," she answered. "And it's my job to be in total control and to massage any part of your body that you like; especially my body." She smiled.</p> <p>"But I want you to be my massage therapist." It sounded so nice and so intimate. "So I need to make sure I don't get myself in trouble."</p> <p>"Oh, well, I understand." She smiled again and began walking towards me. "Here, I'll put these on for you." She placed her left hand over my left knee and pushed up, forcing my thigh. "It's OK now, Kathy. You've got me right here." Her right hand moved to my chest and she cupped and rubbed it. She rubbed my chest making me groan, then her hands moved down past the small of my back towards my ass. She began to rub my cheeks together, her fingers touching the crack between them. My cock twitched and began to throb as she stroked it. I let out a moan as the pleasure of it sent a bolt straight to my clit.</p> <p>She worked on my back to get my muscles loosened up. I felt her hands moving lower and lower up my legs causing my cock to twitch in her hands. Then one was moving up my ass towards my shoulders. After massaging a while it stopped to move up and down my thighs and belly until finally she touched my clit. As she did it it began to rise like a cock and I felt the tingles throughout my entire body. It felt great!</p> <p>"I'm going to put these on now," she said as she lifted my legs out of the sofa. With a final little push up and down her finger entered my ass holeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
