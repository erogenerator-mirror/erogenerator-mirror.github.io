You see, I did what you did and we've done it a lot lately. We need to take some risk but right now, you are so beautiful it only hurts. You're a sexy and desirable little thing. You just have to let me be in charge."</p> <p>"How about if you give me one of those dildo attachments to put into your little ass?"</p> <p>"What kind of strap-on do you think I'm wearing?"</p> <p>"I'm not talking about dildos but a strap-on. I'm talking about a real cock."</p> <p>"Oh."</p> <p>"You know, I like your attitude. You seem to be putting on a very convincing performance and I can't see you taking any cock with you. But no, just like I said, my dildo is a dildo. Oh, don't make fun of it. It's not like I'm forcing you to use it or anything."</p> <p>He laughs then.</p> <p>I look at him skeptically.</p> <p>"You're always so open and easygoing with me. We just go along on every date."</p> <p>"Oh. I guess I don't trust you."</p> <p>"You'll have a chance with me. You just need to get this over with."</p> <p>"You just want to know why I have one of those dildos and one thing. I know! You think I just wanted more than three dates.</p> <p>He takes a deep breath then.</p> <p>"Yeah, you get that. I'm not going to get any pussy with me but I'll tell you what I'm doing. I'm going to get the dildo you want to have that thing for me. You won't be able to talk or say anything from that will it, will you?"</p> <p>"I guess not."</p> <p>"Then why don't I?"</p> <p>"You're going to have to get the dildo out from under my butt."</p> <p>"That's not likely."</p> <p>"No, I'm not going to take it off unless you give me a chance. And of course I think that's the only way."</p> <p>"Do that. I'll get you back in the mood soon."</p> <p>"Ok. But don't try to get the dildo out without asking me. I have enough time."</p> <p>"Do what?"</p> <p>"You don't have to go through all the trouble of asking me anything."</p> <p>"I know. But, you're already looking to get me in the mood."</p> <p>"Ok, I understand."</p> <p>I'm looking at him now. Even though I never knew he was this way. I just think he is sexy and he just takes the time to talk to me, let me know he's on for a chance at seeing me and being with me.</p> <p>"I'll see you around?"</p> <p>"I'll be in my room. I'll ask you to make some plans, see what happens."</p> <p>I smile and he kisses me briefly.</p> <p>"I'll be watching."</p> <p>I turn out the light and try to get dressed.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm so embarrassed. It's just you and me and you're wearing that dress right now."</p> <p>"Well, it's only after I got the dildo out of your butt that I decided not to wear it."</p> <p>"You can't be serious."</p> <p>"Yes. I am. I know I'm the most desirable man on the planet."</p> <p>She blushes but looks back at me.</p> <p>"So, what do you think about the way I think about you? You are such an attractive woman. Can I maybe be an older woman again, perhaps even older?"</p> <p>"Well, we can try a new approach but not until a bigger cock is in your pocket. But, you can't just put your finger in my vagina."</p> <p>I don't say anything for a minute.</p> <p>"I want you to. I'm sure that's something you would like to try. But it's just for now."</p> <p>I'm not sure how to put it.</p> <p>"This is my last chance."</p> <p>Well, it's more of an excuse to have all sorts of fun.</p> <p>"I understand and I'll do whatever it takes to do that."</p> <p>She blushes and I can see she is embarrassed.</p> <p>"Just for me?"</p> <p>"Do you think you're pretty desirable and sexy and sexy? Well, let's see if we can't get you another chance. But I'm sure it's for all of us. I'm a sexy looking woman."</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"That's a long question."</p> <p>"Just think about it."</p> <p>"Um...well, um, I have to tell you it wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
