I can't even stand on it anymore." I said with my arms open and arms wide to support myself.</p> <p>"Well, that would be nice too." He answered as he placed my hand on his hard cock as it had been. He was looking at me with his big smile on his face, he was pleased that we hadn't come in to fuck.</p> <p>I was feeling more than comfortable with him standing there. I enjoyed being in his presence and feeling sexy as we looked at the beautiful men standing by her bed enjoying her pleasure. Just at that moment, a strange thing happened. I leaned forward and kissed it. I could smell the musky smell of my arousal. It reminded him of when I used to get her off with my fingers. He was breathing harder and making little huffs. I pressed harder against him. I felt him hardening with my fingers pressing into him.</p> <p>"Oh God, I want him in me. I want him in my ass. I want him to do your ass." She said breathlessly.</p> <p>"But..I can't." I said as I dropped to my knees and slid my tongue across his cock.</p> <p>He was so hard. She grabbed his ass and pulled him closer. I held his ass cheek with my hand. He was trembling with delight. I licked it again and again. It was a wonderful taste and tasted a little salty. But he was feeling much better. He was enjoying his taste, enjoying her soft touch. He knew I could make him cum without him even touching himself. He felt so good. I could feel his cock begin to thicken a bit as I sucked on him. He looked and her face. His eyes went wide as he realized she was giving him a blow job. He didn't want to make her do it but he didn't want to be caught. He opened his mouth and his eyes grew wide as the heat from her mouth engulfed his cock. His cock pulsed with pleasure. I was sucking on him hard with the intensity of the feeling and he felt so good I wasn't going to last much longer. He pulled her back up to him as he held her ass and moved her hips in circles.</p> <p>I slid his cock inside her. My mouth moved from his head to his neck. He could barely make out me leaning back against him as he held himself above her. The excitement of feeling her body pressed against him was amazing. He could feel her wetness pressed against him and his cock sliding against her as she adjusted to him. She was making a noise like a squeal. His cock was throbbing inside her body. I could feel the heat from her wetness against me. I could hear her moaning in and along his throat. He felt so good. My tongue rubbed against his neck and down to his chest. I licked all over his chest feeling the excitement. I could feel his cock twitching against my hand. It was starting to go all sensitive. He could feel me going crazy with pleasure and he moaned with each pass of my tongue.</p> <p>"Oh baby, I'm going to cum soon." He whispered to her softly.</p> <p>"God, yess....yessss". She said in a breathy voice as she felt him throbbing inside her. I lapped up his cum as he felt himself coming. I could hear it seep out of him then. It was like electricity running through out his body. I loved it. I really loved it. I loved it. I looked up at him. As he looked down at me with his cock still in my hand, he could see that was the most beautiful sight that I had ever seen.</p> <p>He reached up and started at her mouth. He kissed her hard as they got into a sixty-nine position. She put her mouth around his cock and started to slide it up and down the length of it. I was watching her intently as his hips moved up to meet her mouth. It seemed so natural and so right. I was so turned on watching him do a thing like that. It felt so hot to watch him as he stroked himself that way, that's when I felt his cock get larger and bigger inside her mouth. It was so erotic to watch him cum in her mouth, watching himself as he shot his seed inside her wet mouth. Watching her take it in and swallow it, was just so exciting and it was so dirty and I loved it. I couldn't describe it, but feeling his body against me, against my body and watching him stroking himself while having his face buried in my own. I felt so turned on by what I was witnessing.</p> <p>His fingers were stroking her clit and playing with it while his tongue licked her. She was pushing harder against him and he was breathing hard as he kept moving. He was going faster and faster and she was breathing harder.
