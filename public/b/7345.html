She picked it up, and looked in the mirror.</p> <p>"I'm a size too small, I really don't think..."</p> <p>He had not noticed, he had been looking up.</p> <p>"No," She said, "I do that! I've got it from age 4."</p> <p></p> <p>"Oh!"</p> <p></p> <p>He noticed her looking down at herself. He had seen girls getting larger in their teens, but never noticed this!</p> <p></p> <p>"Well then, we don't need to look, will we?"</p> <p></p> <p>He leaned over to her and lightly kissed her on the lips, the lips! This caused her to get a little flush. After that, they were talking and looking at the screen. She was going to get home a little earlier than the time he had said, which was 12:30. She wanted to ask him, or something, but didn't want it on her.</p> <p>They got up to leave together. One of their hands reached down and grabbed the bottom of each others' shirts. While her arms were above her head, her shirt slid up to her breasts. Their hands found each other again and they began to feel each others bodies.</p> <p>In the car, they were touching themselves, and kissing. He had a hand on her breast, and she was rubbing herself. He felt her nipple hard under his palm. His other hand had found its way to her crotch and he could feel she had a wet pussy. She moaned as he touched her and she leaned over at the back of the car to give him more access to her pussy.</p> <p>After leaving home at an hour, they pulled up to the house. She went in the house, and waited for him to come in. She had been out of the car the whole time.</p> <p>"Do you remember what happened today?" she asked.</p> <p>"Of course, my life has changed for the better all of a sudden. That's the reason I never come up with my own plans for what I want to do next!"</p> <p>"I think we need to talk."</p> <p>"That's what happened with you at the motel, and me at the gym... I was out of the picture. I was getting ready to go to this gym, and you suddenly came up and pulled me out of the car park!"</p> <p>"That was the most exciting thing I have ever seen in my life!"</p> <p>"We have to talk seriously now," she said.</p> <p></p> <p>"Yes, we need to."</p> <p>"Oh, ok."</p> <p>They walked on in to her room to talk. She was in bed with her nightclothes on, when she said,</p> <p>"No sex for us tonight."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, that was so exciting, you feel like a teenager again right now, you're so young."</p> <p>"That's because I'm not young, I've grown into, I can give myself to you."</p> <p>"Do I, just once" she said.</p> <p>"I want you, right now"</p> <p>"I know what you're going to say... but you are a woman, not a young woman. I love you and I want to be with you right away."</p> <p>"No, you're wrong. I'm still a man. You have to give up a lot of this. This isn't good for you."</p> <p>"That does sound appealing to me."</p> <p>"Is there someplace else we could go for this talk?"</p> <p>"No, I haven't decided. I don't know if I want to go to the gym with you."</p> <p>"We'll see. You have to decide how you want to proceed or let a man take you there. That's it, but if we go there again, we can't go there again. That's our agreement."</p> <p>"I don't want to go to a gym."</p> <p>"Well then we'll find a suitable place."</p> <p>"Oh," she said, "that would be lovely."</p> <p>"No I don't mean that," he said, "not just yet."</p> <p>She reached out and touched him on the arm, her hand was cold with his warm skin. She couldn't resist a little squeeze.</p> <p></p> <p>She started to unbutton his jacket, while he sat down on the bed.</p> <p>"Wait."</p> <p>He grabbed her hand and pulled her off the bed.</p> <p>"Waitâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
