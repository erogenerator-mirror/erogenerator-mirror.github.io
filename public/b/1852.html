It was out of character for you."</p> <p>"What's the matter?"</p> <p>I hesitated, thinking. "I don't know. Please call me anytime. You'd better start paying attention."</p> <p>"Yes, ma'am," she said with a smile and she gave me a peck on the cheek.</p> <p>"Bye, "she said as turned back to the line and hung up. She quickly wrote her number and gave it to me before turning and heading out the door with her ass to catch up to her parents.</p> <p>"Thank you."</p> <p>I smiled and thought to myself, "Just a quick one on the beach, huh?" I thought a lot about how she was wearing the outfit, thinking about how cute it was. I looked at myself in the mirror first. The dress fit her quite well, coming very snug on her. I put on a tank top, and a pair of khakis to go with it. After getting my things and paying, I headed back to my beach house to set up a little getaway for the weekend.</p> <p>I checked the time, saw it was just about noon, and settled back on my deck. I had some stuff to finish up and start working on some of the new stuff that I had been working on. I closed my eyes and let the sun warm my skin once again. I had put the finishing touches on my tan since I got out and headed to the house.</p> <p>It took me another half an hour before my phone chimed, but I just stood up and looked through the glass.</p> <p>"Hey, sweetheart!" It was her mom, "Is everything on deck?"</p> <p>"Yeah, everybody else is set for the trip, too."</p> <p>"I hope everything is okay," she said with a beaming smile.</p> <p>"Everything will be fine."</p> <p>"I'm so glad you're here by yourself," she went on, "we're getting so hot today."</p> <p>"How about you go put a few things away? Just grab some towels and everything."</p> <p>"Sure. I'll be right out," she said as she closed her phone.</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>It took me a few moments to make the decision to leave the house, so there were not even a thousand more minutes to go. I decided to call her cell and get a text at once instead of just going at the desk and typing off the phone.</p> <p>*********</p> <p>I arrived at my apartment around 1:30 a.m., about ten minutes apart. I didn't want to wait till she got home since I had to wait all afternoon to get ready for the trip. It made my time at home easier, since I knew I would have it done by late afternoon, just as a matter of fact.</p> <p>I opened the door and opened the front door. There she was outside. Her dress was a long, silky, blue one that hugged her body, showing every curve underneath it. It was sleeveless and it covered everything, even her small breasts, but it showed everything. She looked amazing. Her arms were slender and fit around her body. She stood about 5'6", which was about perfect, and the dress was of a lighter shade of blue that matched her eyes. The fabric was a lacey, burgundy. The fabric seemed to be like pure silk between her breasts and it felt as if they were made of porridge. Her hair cascaded over her shoulder and was pulled back into a bun with three loose strands. A dark hair color encircled her eyes in a soft but sensual way. She stood taller than me and I admired her body. Her legs looked strong but they were slender, not just muscular, but they were firm and strong. Her hips were wide and flared. Her boobs looked large as if they had been made out of dough. She looked incredibly sexy.</p> <p>She smiled as she stepped in, closing the door behind, giving me yet another view into her lacy burgundy body. I smiled and took a couple steps toward her, taking a step into her. We looked at each other for a moment, sizing each other up, sizing each other out, before she said, "Wow, handsome."</p> <p>"Thank you," I said as I closed the distance between us and kissed her on the lips. Our kisses were soft and sweet. She pulled me towards her, forcing my lips on hers as our noses brushed together, making us share a sensually slow wet kiss as our mouths moved against each other. I reached down with my hand and lifted her right leg towards me, spreading it slightly, and she stepped into me.</p> <p>As our lips parted, she said, "Oh god, I want you."</p> <p>"So do Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
