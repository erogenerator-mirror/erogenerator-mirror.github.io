I didn't mean it was up to me, I... I mean it wasn't that you would enjoy it."</p> <p>I looked into her eyes, "I don't care if it was up to you. It was just... I don't know what the hell it was that I was going to do."</p> <p>She smiled, "It was just that, that was all your fault... You needed to understand that you were just the right age, because your age was just so young. And you were young enough to just take advantage of what I knew was coming soon."</p> <p>She paused, "And you are right," I said, and I smiled a little. "I guess I should get back downstairs. I think I am just going to shower and put some clothes on for now and come downstairs?" I nodded. I felt like taking a quick look around the house and then heading back upstairs.</p> <p>"I'm going to change." I said to her, still facing her. "I have some hot things to do. You know where to find me."</p> <p>"I should probably go and let you change," she said. "I'll be back in a while." She left the room and left the door open. I looked at the door to see that mom was out of the other room. I looked back to see that mom was standing in the kitchen. I got out of the bathroom and looked out. And the bathroom was filled with steam and was filled with a few of the same air freshener chemicals. I shook my head and closed the door to the hallway to see if mom had come downstairs yet. I had almost finished when she walked in and was looking at me.</p> <p>"I was just looking for mom," I said, as I walked into mom's room. "Why do you have to use the steam to get in the bath?" she asked, pulling her shirt up to show me. I shook my head and laughed as I watched her. She turned on the tub and walked in the bath. She bent forward and lifted her back up, exposing all of her tanned back and breasts to me. I saw how large they were, and I wondered how they ever fit through her shirt.</p> <p>Mom had turned the water on and then leaned forward again as she sat there with her top off with her legs spread wide. "I am sorry," she said as she looked towards the tub. "I am... I don't know why I did it. I will never do something like that again," she said. "I just can't. I'm so sorry. I just didn't mean to do that." She looked at me with a funny look. "I guess I need to wash my hair but there is no soap in the tub."</p> <p>"Yeah," I said. "I'll take it."</p> <p>"It isn't that easy," she said, looking at me. "I am so sorry. I just... I'm going to change." She pulled her shirt up over her arms and let it fall to the floor. She stood there and looked at herself in the mirror. "I'm not really sure what I am looking..." she said, reaching for her shirt.</p> <p>I walked over to her. I looked into her eyes. I felt warmth come off of her and she looked so beautiful. "I think you are beautiful," I said and kissed her lips. She smiled and kissed my lips back, as I walked into her room. I had changed back into my shorts, but my shirt had fallen forward and I now had on a t-shirt and a pair of shorts. I sat down on the front of mom's bed. I leaned forward and kissed her lips. She pulled me close and her hand went across my stomach to my cock. We broke our kiss and we both saw what had really happened out of the corner of our eyes. It was pretty obvious, because the rest of my clothing went into her closet. I sat down and started to get up to go and change.</p> <p>"I didn't think..." I began to say, as I saw both mom and my mother standing in the doorway.</p> <p>"Of course you didn't," mom replied. I stood up as my mother started to walk in. "I'm sorry," mom said. "I shouldn't have done that." She pulled the shirt that I had on up off out of its loops and then took it off. I watched as she took her shirt off completely. She was wearing only bikini bottoms below, which were still slightly wet. She stood there looking at herself in the mirror, "You look..." she said, as she turned around. My mom turned around a half turn and leaned over the bed. I saw the side of her tit, as I always imagined her to have was there, and I realized how hard I had been in the car, and how many times I hadâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
