Her hand was in both of mine. “It makes me so horny.”</p> <p>I nodded and moved my hand to her thigh. She pulled my hand up and kissed me. “I hope you're not upset if I take my panties off.”</p> <p>I nodded. She kissed me again and moved my hand up her leg. “This is great!” she moaned as her body began to squirm.</p> <p>My hand reached her pussy. She turned her body so she faced me. I pushed my middle finger into her. Her eyes closed and her mouth opened.</p> <p>We kissed. Her body shook and I could feel it. This was making me hornier. I slowly pulled my middle finger from her. “Ohh, God!” she moaned and pushed it into my mouth.</p> <p>“Mmmm – so delicious,” I moaned as she began to grind her pussy into me.</p> <p>“Oh – so hot…” she moaned as the pleasure became so sensitive that she pulled my hair.</p> <p>“I’m so wet for you, Lacey. If that’s what you want, I’ll do it for you,” I said. She giggled and pulled me to her. I knelt once more. “Kiss me - please – kiss me – please –”</p> <p>She kissed me again as if asking to be kissed. It took both my lips and her tongue to get her off. Her body quaked as she came. I slid her panties out of the way, and quickly moved down to suck on her pussy. Then I was kissing her clit, running my lips over it. I slid my tongue over it, taking it all in.</p> <p>“Oh, God.”</p> <p>I worked my tongue up and down it. She was making little moans.</p> <p>I kissed and licked her pussy. She was making little sounds in the back of her throat the entire time. Her pussy would quiver when my tongue went near her hole. She started to thrust into my mouth as I licked her clit. Her body tensed again.</p> <p>“Oh!” “Ohhhhhh – oh yeah,” I heard her panting in my ear. I slid a finger into her and moved it up to her ass. She was still shaking and quivering.</p> <p>“Okay, baby,” I said. “Roll over, put your ass in the air for me.”</p> <p>She spread her legs slightly, and I was in the process of giving her the most intense orgasm she had ever given me. She was moving her hips slightly as I licked her. Her thighs were tight together at first. And then she relaxed again. Her head came up, and she was looking deeply into my eyes. “Oh, God,” she moaned.</p> <p>“What was that?” I asked.</p> <p>“That –” she panted. “That was – you're driving me crazy –”</p> <p>“You’re making me crazy,” I said. I moved on top of her, and slowly lowered my pussy onto hers, pressing the head of my cock against her lips. She opened her mouth and I started to slowly push through. I was half way in. My head was barely inside of her before she was letting go of both of her legs and crossing them. I couldn’t believe how much of my cock was going into her. When my hips were just an inch from hers, she grabbed a hold of it and moved it again. Our bodies locked in our embrace.</p> <p>I could feel my orgasm starting to build. I wasn’t going to last, but Lacey’s hips were doing the same. She didn’t move her hips. I could feel her hot pussy against mine. Her hands were moving on my back and we were almost touching. It felt sooooo good! But I couldn’t hold back and my orgasm broke. I shot my load of come into her.</p> <p>I lowered on her and we kissed, our tongues touching, tasting.</p> <p>I stayed inside of her as we kissed. I was amazed at the amount of come that had landed on her body. I lifted my head to kiss her shoulder when I felt my orgasm start again. We kissed and rolled together a couple more times. Both of us giggled.</p> <p>We broke the kiss. Lacey said, “Let’s eat,” and helped me dress. She was still very flushed from my orgasm. Her nipples were hard again.</p> <p>“The food was fantastic,” I said—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
