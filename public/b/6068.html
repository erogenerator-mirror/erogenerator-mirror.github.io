He was a guy who knew he needed sex. He wanted to have sex for money.</p> <p>I was a guy who needed sex. He loved sex. He didn't like it. He did it to do his job, to save money. He didn't like it, didn't like what his boss was doing for him, had to work for him, to make him happy.</p> <p>And he was making sex.</p> <p>His mouth opened in a grin.</p> <p>He laughed happily.</p> <p>I saw his eyes light up. He was a happily-mannered, caring guy, who did nothing but keep his job, and not complain about how much he was going to miss sex until he found something different, something that gave him more time, and more satisfaction. I smiled.</p> <p>I liked what I was seeing. I liked the fact that he hadn't objected to being in charge of sex. He actually liked being in charge of sex.</p> <p>My cock had already began to stir.</p> <p>We continued to kiss, and I felt his cock begin to rise. I pushed my hips forward as he lifted me and he gently slid me down on the sofa seat and moved his body to the other side of me.</p> <p>I kissed and nibbled his neck, his collarbone, and his chest. I worked my way down his body, enjoying his cock, caressing his balls with my fingertips. He was hard and erect, and I kissed and flicked it as I worked my way to it. I could feel him begin to throb with desire and desire. I smiled, and lightly ran my tongue the length of his shaft. He felt as good as he looked, all taut and hard and smooth, and I swirled my tongue around and across it.</p> <p>He pulled my head back so I could look up at him and he took my face in his hands. He drew me down to him and I felt him place his cheek on my shoulder where he had my head rested. He pulled me down hard as I sat on his cock, and I looked up at him in his eyes.</p> <p>"I have a special treat waiting, baby." His lips were against my ear. He whispered, "I'd like your ass, if you would play with these for me."</p> <p>"I guess, I guess that would be good." I smiled and sat down on him. I felt as good as he did, as good as I'd ever felt. I looked down at his cock and could see he was as hard as I was and as hard and as happy as I was.</p> <p>I watched as he slowly guided his cock into my ass. It seemed to take forever, and when I felt him bottom out I closed my eyes and waited. He leaned down so my arms were above my head and his mouth was just at the point of entering my asshole. Before the first few inches of him entered I let out a soft moan and held my breath. He felt incredible, so huge in my ass. I heard him moan and I felt his hand on the back of my head as he guided my mouth to his cock.</p> <p>I began to lick his cock, my lips and the bottom of his shaft as he slowly pushed further into me. I could feel my ass lips rubbing along his shaft, my mouth sliding along his length, and my hands on his ass, pulling him deeper into me all at once. I was enjoying every second, loving every second he was inside me.</p> <p>He had a way with his cock that felt so fucking good in my ass. He filled me fully; almost full enough of his shaft into me to feel every inch of me sliding up his shaft as if this was the same thing that he was doing with his cock. I moaned as the head of him began to rub and stimulate all the sensitive nerve endings in my ass that ran up from my rectum to my head, and back down again as he began to fuck me more energetically.</p> <p>He began to fuck me harder and faster, and I felt my legs begin to shake. I wanted to grab into him with my hands, to hold onto him, to hold onto his shoulders, to hold him in me, so he would do what he needed to do until he finally came and filled me.</p> <p>Then it was like there was no air left in the world. I was in bliss, I was floating, he was inside me, I was feeling myself as a lover and I wanted him completely to move inside me.</p> <p>I didn't care about anything else at that moment at all. All I knew was that he was going to cum, and that was going to be awesome. And I was going to give him what he needed to fuck me harder, and as hard as he was going to fuck me.</p> <p>I felt his hips begin to lift, and then they'dâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
