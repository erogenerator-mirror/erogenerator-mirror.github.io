You are beautiful and I want you to wear clothes... I want you to dress so that when you are here I can see who it is that has turned you on. It seems to me that you have a special quality about you, or your body... that tells me that you have a lot of talent."</p> <p>His hand had landed in the middle of her spine just below her shoulder. He had found the zip in the back of her dress. There was the zipper. A moment ago there had been no place for him to go. Now, and then, in the darkness of the room, when she hadn't objected, when she was still wearing her dress, he'd found it so sensual and she'd been so happy when he did that to her. She had given herself to him in ways that she had never allowed anyone else to do.</p> <p>She wasn't sure why she was enjoying this now. He was getting to know her and she wouldn't feel so vulnerable. It was as though she was a little girl that had a crush on a teacher-slut. He had made her very happy. It was his responsibility to show how much. He'd made her beautiful. She wanted him to do that.</p> <p>He made her feel so alive.</p> <p>"I... I've never had a man...." She stammered out. She hadn't meant to say it. She had meant to see what a man could do with a girl that looked just like he was. She didn't mean to do all that to a man's ego and that would have been awful. It could also have been so good that she couldn't have cared about being what she was...</p> <p>Or what a thing it was. It didn't matter if she really didn't mind what she was doing. He had been right in the head of everything that had been going on in her mind. He had been right in her heart and it had been her heart that had pulled up in her, and she couldn't have stopped him if she'd wanted to.</p> <p>"I've not had a man in six years," she managed to say, her voice full of love. "How could I not know? What a privilege it is for you to see something that you want, but don't have the opportunity to experience?"</p> <p>He had taken two fingers from her and held them in his hand, staring at her hand in his. She could imagine what he was thinking. She knew that her body was betraying her. He held her hand and she looked into his eyes. He smiled at her, and she knew that he could see her. She saw the way that she could make a man smile at her in so many ways. It was almost as though he'd be able to read her mind.</p> <p>He kissed her palm. It was gentle. The kisses he'd given in his office before were tender, loving. He let his hand wander to her side. He ran his fingers between her fingers and he was surprised at how soft it felt.</p> <p>"It is what I'd expect," he whispered to her. "It is what we have together and what I know I could never share with anyone. When I was younger, I used to tease and play with my sisters and we'd have to go home and kiss each other like I did when I was a child."</p> <p>"I guess I could have stopped you," she said. She didn't have to pretend that she did. She could have stopped him, and at least, if she hadn't known that his own heart would never be in it to help her. But she had no desire to do it and she was a woman of her word. She had only to put up with what had been done to her. Just as she could do with other men.</p> <p>She was aware that he could be a very manly person. But she couldn't help but be amused at the thought of him.</p> <p>Her hands had moved to his waist. Her fingers slipped around the side of his broad chest. He was like a man but much more muscular. She had thought it hard on him not to look at her but it only got better. She had to admit that he made her feel... wanted. There was something about him that made her feel special. Perhaps he was not so manly now... or maybe he was a better looking man now. She had wondered if she could handle whatever it was that had happened to her. It seemed almost as though her soul was now singing in a place where she couldn't go.</p> <p>She had had a feeling when he put both hands on her breasts that somehow. If he held them he was rubbing them gently, and then he'd pull back, and he would do it again. She had felt his hardness pressing against her belly... but it wasn't evenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
