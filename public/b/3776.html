I ask.</p> <p>"I love it," she tells me.</p> <p>Taking a moment, I tell her how much I love it, how much I am excited, how much I want to do this, how I hope to meet and fuck that cute ass of hers, her perfect little bubble jiggly.</p> <p>"You've done that before?" she asks.</p> <p>"Yes, I mean," I say, "with the school, or as we get in town, at least. When I was in Europe I used to come home alone."</p> <p>"Well this may be just the thing, the first step," she says, "that's all."</p> <p>She turns, smiles her, and runs her fingers over my thigh.</p> <p>I'm ready for some more.</p> <p>She pulls off my jersey, and I'm standing before her, looking down at her.</p> <p>Her lips, once again, just as beautiful and soft as always.</p> <p>She kisses my nose, and says, "I've missed you."</p> <p>I want to kiss her for the rest of my days, but it's too late.</p> <p>She kisses me, and runs her hands over my chest.</p> <p>I push her skirt up, and she pulls down my swim suit.</p> <p>I take a deep breath and look at her.</p> <p>She is amazing.</p> <p>"I love you," I tell her, as though a song will answer your soul.</p> <p>She pulls up one of her panties. I kiss her inner thighs, and move my face in closer to her crotch.</p> <p>She spreads her legs, and I run my nose and mouth up and down her.</p> <p>I can't get enough.</p> <p>She reaches down to the hem of my suit, and I put my hand between her legs. She moans.</p> <p>Her lips are swollen, a swollen wetness between her legs.</p> <p>I use two fingers, to spread her open, to probe a little.</p> <p>Her lips, her inner walls, are engorged, ready to welcome me, welcome me in, want to be a part of me.</p> <p>Her lips are swollen and wide open.</p> <p>My tongue, the tip, makes circles inside of her, just under her hood.</p> <p>Her juices are flowing, soaking my face, as I explore her there.</p> <p>She writhes now, in response to my mouth, her soft cries of want.</p> <p>I slide a second finger inside of her, and move my tongue up and down, circling her clit.</p> <p>She pushes herself up against my lips, opening her legs to me.</p> <p>I kiss her inner walls again, getting close to her center, and bring my tongue up and down her little button. She moans.</p> <p>My fingers move faster.</p> <p>Her hips move and gyrate on mine.</p> <p>She says over and over, "More, oh God more please" with each word.</p> <p>"Please," I say over and over as it never fails to get me there.</p> <p>Her mouth opens up and she moans with the first orgasm of the day. Her entire body shakes.</p> <p>"Yes," she groans through her mouth full. "Oh God."</p> <p>"Yes!"</p> <p>"Fuck me like a slut" she yells at me, "please," as she pushes her hips up in an upward motion.</p> <p>I slip two fingers inside of her.</p> <p>My tongue circles her clit, and she grabs the back of my hair to hold me in place.</p> <p>Her body is now on fire, my fingers slide in and out of the tiny channel, moving up and down the length of her, getting closer to her pleasure.</p> <p>"Faster!" she yells, and my mouth descends on a part of her inner wall again.</p> <p>I flick at it, then lick it.</p> <p>"Now!" she screams, as she feels me lick her there all the time.</p> <p>She cries out as she climaxes, and I can't believe the pressure that builds inside her as her orgasm starts.</p> <p>She screams out again, "Faster!" as she pushes hard into me and then collapses onto my lap, a mass of flesh, like ripe fruit.</p> <p>When she comes down from her climax, she has me hold her, so she can breathe, and she kisses me all along the way.</p> <p>She lays her head on my chest.</p> <p>I get a kiss to my forehead.</p> <p>"It'll be okay," she says.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"I love you," she says.</p> <p>"I love you too," I reply, and she smiles.</p> <p>She takes two steps back.</p> <p>"So we'll fuck?" I ask her, as we walk slowly towards the beachâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
