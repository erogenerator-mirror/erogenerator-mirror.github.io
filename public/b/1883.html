He began kissing and licking and sucking my left earlobe. God, it felt so good. He used his thumb and thumb and fingers to pull and tickle my ears. Then he inserted 2 fingers into my ear canal, stretching me wide and pushing his hands deeper into my shoulders and stomach. He began to work them out of my ears, pushing them out with little circular motions over and into my forehead. I couldn't move my head because it was so big. He began to kiss and lick my right side down the length of my jaw line. He left a big wet mark on my left side. I gasped. I couldn't believe how well it felt. The way he was doing it so slowly and carefully, working that area of my neck with his warm breath and the light strokes with his tongue and lips had me in a state of complete and utter ecstacy.</p> <p>He kissed all around my neck and I was in a state of euphoria. I was dizzy and it felt like a mini-van or something being pumped for a thousand miles.</p> <p>I couldn' feel it, too. My whole body was on fire. I had never felt so turned on; in my entire life. My whole body felt light, my breathing was shallow, my pussy was twitching, and my nipples were becoming numb like the bones of a dead man's chest.</p> <p>When he finally stopped, my whole body started tingling. It was the best feeling ever. My head was spinning. I was completely exhausted. I was so weak. I hadn't been able to move for a few minutes, though, so I didn't know if I wanted to.</p> <p>Mark picked me up and carried me, still on my knees, back toward the bedroom. Oh my God! I couldn't believe I had the nerve to do that. Did he do anything else that I didn't know about? Well, he did that. He took off his robe and laid me down across his lap, then started to rub my shoulders. I was shaking. He massaged down my neck and shoulders, working his way up to the small of my back. I knew there must be a lot of nerves on my shoulders; and they were throbbing. I felt so tired, but he didn't seem to be letting up on rubbing my shoulders. He was making me feel so alive, and I felt like the air had been sucked out of my lungs. I wasn't sure, though, how long I had had been asleep. I couldn't believe how good his mouth felt on me. It took control of my body and I was powerless to stop it. I felt like I was in total control.</p> <p>Then something weird happened. I felt his right hand sliding up my leg as he kept massaging my butt. It was like an electric shock to all my nerves. I knew it was just as weird and incredible as his thumb felt moving up my ass cheeks. I couldn't believe it. I was so relaxed I thought I would be able to lift a horse in a second. Finally, I stopped shaking and I could feel my heart rate go to normal. I was sure he knew that I was feeling that way. It had an amazing combination of his cock and my ass. I was sure we could make our house explode. We had never tried anything like this before. I'd never even seen a hand there before.</p> <p>Eventually Mark stopped, his hand still resting on my ass, his fingers still touching my clit. I felt as though I might faint. He helped me up off him, then lay us down next to each other. I was still in a state of near-consciousness. I had never felt so alive, so alive. His hands felt so great on my skin. They felt so soft. It was as though they were made of feathers. I felt like if you lay your hands on my right breast and your fingers brushed my nipple. I looked into Mark's eyes and could tell I was falling head over heels. I wanted to move; I wanted to get up and try some more. I was so weak I couldn't move. I just lay there, thinking about the feeling of him touching me again.</p> <p>I felt him turn me over on my back. Then he was on top of me kissing me. Then they started kissing. Our tongues were dancing together. I closed my eyes and didn't have to look at his face to know he was going to fuck me, and in some cases it did. I felt so sexy. So sexy that I just wanted to move to take a little more control. I wanted to do all this, all the things that I had always wanted, all that I had wanted to do, all that I had never told anyone else. This was so strange. I opened my eyes and just watched him as he slowly slid his cock into me. I was so hot and wet I thought I was going to burstâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
