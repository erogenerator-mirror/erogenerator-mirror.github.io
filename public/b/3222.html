It wasn't on the computer," I answered. "It was right outside of the door," I concluded.</p> <p>"What do you think I did, though?" she asked.</p> <p>"I... I don't know... It was weird. I knew I shouldn't have been watching... I couldn't have been," I explained.</p> <p>"It was weird?" she said, not sounding amused at the thought of me watching her masturbate.</p> <p>"Yeah... It was... I didn't mean for it to happen that way." I said. I wasn't feeling sorry for myself. I was really starting to enjoy the hell out of it.</p> <p>"Yeah, you know what we... we haven't done it in years, you know." she replied. "That means I got a lot from you, you know," she added.</p> <p>"Yeah, I know, and..." I said. I tried to take it all in, the fact that she had come to think of it, and also to be honest about the fact that it was still a big part of her, and that she still remembered this particular part of our sex life together, even if was still a few months behind her and was still very new in our relationship.</p> <p>"Well, at least you got to see what I was doing when you came in," she replied.</p> <p>I had gotten a picture in my mind, of a woman sitting there watching me, not even a finger stroking my cock. I had had sex with someone else once, in my imagination, but this was different. I wasn't masturbating to thoughts of women who couldn't see my face or my dick, but I did get to watch her do things with another woman... and I loved it.</p> <p>She didn't seem the least bit shocked that I wanted it to happen, that she had no idea that it would. Not that she was a prude, especially on her part, but something else had occurred to her as well.</p> <p>"I thought I'd leave," I told her. "What have you been doing?"</p> <p>"I'm... I'm... I'm sorry," she replied, blushing a bit but not as embarrassed as I thought she was about all of it. I hadn't even given her the opportunity to explain it, it really hit home that the sexual desire she had when she was younger was still a little over-the-top, but it was still there.</p> <p>"It must have been interesting to some people, huh?" I asked. "I'm sorry too."</p> <p>"Maybe we should stop," she said, and I just could not see what she was doing with the other part of her.</p> <p>She had reached under her shirt and had untied it and was undoing it, as if I wasn't there. I could see that she was removing her underwear too... and all I could see was what I assumed to be her bush... and what was exposed of both her legs and her vagina. Her lips were exposed, too, and there was nothing there other than the pink flesh surrounding them.</p> <p>"See... that looks pretty..." I commented, not even realizing she was not looking at the screen. I couldn't believe how sexy and beautiful she was.</p> <p>She was looking at me, at the screen, at herself as I looked and what was showing on the computer.</p> <p>"I... I didn't think I would be... I mean I hope you wouldn't mind, but this time I..."</p> <p>"Uh..." she started, and then stopped, as if unsure for sure of what to say.</p> <p>I was so caught up in my thoughts now, and the sudden realization that this girl was actually looking at me, I wasn't even sure if I could speak. It took me a few moments, but by then I had a strong feeling of excitement coursing through me. My excitement was a bit too strong, and just then we heard a sound coming from the bedroom.</p> <p>I thought we would have some privacy, but my eyes were locked on her... the woman in the room, who I was sure would be masturbating. She was so good at what she did, but the look of shock on her face, and the realization that she was watching me, I wasn't sure how to react.</p> <p>For a brief moment I was torn between the conflicting feelings racing through my mind, and one which was of extreme excitement and fear and arousal mixed with a combination of lust and fear. I looked at her, I wanted to do something, but my curiosity about it had been such that I just stood there watching her for awhile. I couldn't quite decide if I wanted to say or do anything.</p> <p>Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
