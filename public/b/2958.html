No, it was all about the new man-to-be. He had asked her for a date and now he was the one she chose. He wasn't about to take his cock away from any of her partners. What a perfect fit. She was all mine and more. She was on the bed, face down and ass up, pussy slightly raised. Her head was toward the door.</p> <p>I crawled onto the bed and lifted the butt plug from its hole. It was a small cock shaped object, with little balls on it as well as the other two. It didn't hold the plug and it was easy to roll it under. She was still not sure what that was for, but it didn't matter. She was ready for him.</p> <p>I positioned myself between her legs. I placed my hands on her inner thighs and began to gently massage. She began to sigh as I touched there and she was soon wet and ready for him. I gently pushed her knees higher. She was spread out before him, offering him her ass. His cock was hard but it was difficult to penetrate her. I slowly pulled her cheeks apart. Her cheeks puckered as my hand caressed them. I took it between my finger and thumb and began to caress her anal opening. Her breathing began to increase.</p> <p>I rubbed and pulled her rosebud as I gently pushed my cock into her. She was a perfect slave. I slowly entered her, reveling in feeling our naked flesh. I slowly stroked my cock as I slipped it in and out of her. She started to squirm as I touched another point deep inside her.</p> <p>I continued to stroke her from inside her. I would push in when she started to relax and slowly push in. Then slowly pull out. I was going faster as I felt her loosen up for him.</p> <p>I could tell she was getting better with each push. She began to beg me to fuck her faster. I knew she would do whatever was asked of her. She was going to enjoy this. I could tell she was getting close.</p> <p>She could feel me swelling and she begged me to let her cum. I pulled her pussy against mine with my cock as I shot deep into her. As I did this she lifted her ass higher on her knees. I knew she was getting to a point of no return. She was in for a wonderful orgasm at least for the first time. She screamed as her orgasm went on and on. She was cumming harder than ever.</p> <p>I had just come back down from her orgasm when I felt her legs being lowered to the mattress with my weight. I pulled out of her and climbed onto the bed. As I was climbing up she pushed her ass up for me. I knelt behind it. I guided myself inside and began to fuck her. As we fucked we kissed. I reached up and touched her neck as I fucked her.</p> <p>We fucked and she began to beg for me not to stop. At the end she was the only one still having the orgasm. As she orgasmed in my arms we lay on the bed in each others arms on the bed.</p> <p>At that instant the doorbell rang. I quickly cleaned himself up, threw on some clothes and left my guest room. I heard her coming downstairs as I got dressed. Then there was silence in the room. I checked and saw that it was not Jack as she had expected.</p> <p>I got dressed and went to see Jack. I went inside. He greeted me with a deep kiss.</p> <p>"Hi Steve. I didn't expect to see you there. I thought we were going to go out. I was hoping you would be here," he told me. He had a big smile on his face. When he saw my eyes looking at the door, it was obvious I had not seen him for long.</p> <p>"Jack wants to talk to you," I said. I wasn't going to wait for his response.</p> <p>"Hi Steve. It'll be alright for her if she wants to talk. She's a little busy."</p> <p>"Of course. I can understand her. I just wish she had some more time to finish up."</p> <p>"Jack told me to be in his class, so I'm going to be behind," I told him. Jack knew I would keep an eye on him for a while.</p> <p>"That seems okay by me," I told him. "The first bell is about to start. If you're all ready, come upstairs and we'll have lunch," I told him as I handed him a glass of wine.</p> <p>Jack was in the living room when I got upstairs to get ready. He was still in his study robe.</p> <p>"I guess this is going to be a little awkward when Jack comes down."</p> <p>"Come on, Jack. What are you waiting for? Let's go.
