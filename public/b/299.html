In the beginning her whole being was centered on the feelings, but now it was coming out completely, pushing the thoughts in her brain to the surface.</p> <p>As her body was coming out, the sensation from its first orgasm seemed to be amplified over the initial orgasm, she felt the tingling sensation of the orgasms begin and felt the familiar ache growing in her belly, as she imagined she was watching people having wild sex on screen. She was still amazed at how much pleasure she could bring to the orgasms. Her eyes rolled back into her head, as tears rolled down into her eyes as a massive orgasm crashed through her body. The waves broke and her whole body shuddered as her orgasm was broken.</p> <p>She didn't know how long they were in bed. All she really cared about was the wonderful feeling she was feeling under his mouth. She wanted to tell him, but he just kept sucking her pussy and she knew she wouldn't say anything until their night was over.</p> <p>She felt her chest heaving as she continued to catch her breath. She hadn't even noticed how warm and soft it was. He continued to lick her, making her knees turn to jelly. She pulled him up to her with both arms and held him in a loving embrace. She just couldn't stop thinking about the way he made her feel. How he made her feel so alive and so incredibly hot. Her whole body felt warm and tingly, like she had never felt before. She had never felt anything like this. She just pulled him tight against her body, loving every minute of it.</p> <p>He had no idea how long she remained in the blissful state of her climax. He thought he heard her moaning as if she were in ecstasy, but she was just thinking about her body and what it was it had just experienced. She knew they weren't coming apart, and in fact she was so excited from feeling him inside her that she'd actually said "fucking" it. She hadn't just said it had something to do with anything she loved, except for that wonderful feeling of fullness, and the way it so gently pulsed inside her, as it grew even larger. She couldn't help it, she said it was the only way it would go any farther.</p> <p>His tongue was still inside her. He would just thrust it hard up inside of her. She reached up and felt his rock hard, black dick sliding into her palm. She could feel it throbbing in what was left of the condom.</p> <p>"Fuck," she said, "that's going to have to come out of me if I keep pushing it, though I can't help thinking about how good this feels."</p> <p>He just said, "I can't believe you haven't even had an orgasm. That must be hard to deal with, huh?"</p> <p>She pulled him by his hand up to her mouth. He pulled her arms around his neck and kissed her deeply.</p> <p>"That was even better than I thought," he said. "There's still one more thing I'd like to have. Would you like to try it?"</p> <p>"Definitely!" she said. "I'd like to get some more of that big black thing that you put in me."</p> <p>She pulled him up to lay down on the bed with her. They rolled over, his big, dark dick sticking up in the air. She looked down at his magnificent black organ, and then down at his hard, black cock. God, it looked good. He had a big, strong looking dick. She just smiled.</p> <p>"Just lay still for a minute and enjoy it, huh?"</p> <p>She smiled and lay down on him. He started slowly, not wanting to hurt her. She was still just holding his dick and kissing it. The tip, and the head were just touching a hole. It looked as though it would be very easy to slide into her as it grew and got even longer. He wanted to pull it out of her, but she wouldn't let him. He finally managed to get the head of it inside her.</p> <p>"Gently," he said gently. "Just hold it there."</p> <p>"Okay," she said, still staring him in the eye, but also moving her hips up and down to try to help some of the length slide in. She started looking around her and then down at his big, hard, black cock. She reached down and wrapped her hand around his dick, starting to stroke it.</p> <p>It felt like it would take forever, but she finally got him in fully as she felt her pussy stretch around it. He had taken the longest time to get fully inside her. She was wetter than she had ever felt before. He moved his other hand around and started to stroke her clit.</p> <p>"Don't stop," he sighedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
