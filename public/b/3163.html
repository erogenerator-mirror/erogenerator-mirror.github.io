My parents thought about me often. And I've known you a long time; we've known each other for a long time."</p> <p>"Really - it's no big deal," I said.</p> <p>"I think it's a big deal. My parents thought it was, so their feelings can be counted on at some point. When I got to work this morning, my boss, who also owns the plant, knew what I was up to and let me in. He asked me to sign up for a review, and he knows there's a market for plants here. But he knows about the plant business. For the past year, I've been working for him and this is the closest he'll feel ever."</p> <p>"He already knows," I laughed. "You and the other girls have your work mapped out, even if those are for private projects."</p> <p>"I'm no one's personal assistant. So no, I don't have anything he'll approve of. But if he and people like him, then I can be sure that my services will be adequate to meet that needs."</p> <p>"How does he know you think he's ready to handle his business?"</p> <p>"I don't know. I know it's hard to believe. We've talked on the phone, on our lunch break, on several occasions, but we haven't talked about him. But when he said his mind was elsewhere I knew exactly what to do with the time."</p> <p>"So we'll have something together, and what better way then to have lunch again."</p> <p>"I think I should put some clothes on for the picnic," I said.</p> <p>"Okay. Don't leave - you can use the showers, so we'll have something to eat."</p> <p>************â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
