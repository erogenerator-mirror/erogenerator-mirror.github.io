She was not only a natural submissive but was a natural dominant. I could understand that; even though both women loved it.</p> <p>"Good," he said and stood up, moving behind Trish and bending her over the bed, "Your next assignment will be for you to play with my balls. Trish, will you please touch my balls?"</p> <p>Trish took his hard manhood in both hands and stroked him. She moved her fingertips up and down his length before looking into his eyes and then slowly kissing him on the neck down to the top of his chest. He could taste her sweetness on her lips and could feel how excited she was.</p> <p>"Is that okay with you?" he asked her in that sexy, sweet voice.</p> <p>"It's a little weird, but it's fine with me," she answered while continuing to stroke him. Trish leaned forward and pressed her tongue to his lips. His tongue was immediately in her mouth and she could taste herself on him. He pressed closer and let his hands roam over her body.</p> <p>She responded by slowly spreading the cheeks of her ass. She felt so wicked looking at him while his fingers probed between her cheeks and then his hands slid between them. She couldn't take it anymore and lifted her head, bringing her lips to his and passionately kissing him. Their tongues moved together like a pair of snakes in a petal.</p> <p>His hands went to her ass and his fingers pressed deeper into her. As his fingers probed deeper he could feel the heat from her body as she responded. He could also feel Trish's muscles begin to contract as her hips began to gyrate against his groin. His hands went up along her sides, over her tits and up over her stomach. They were now grinding as his fingers slid over her skin and then up through the wetness between her legs.</p> <p>Her lips moved around and she could feel his cock pushing through his jeans against her. His other hand went to her other breast and began to caress the nipple as he pulled on it. She could feel herself getting wetter with his touch and it drove her wild.</p> <p>"Please," she gasped. "Fuck me, Master."</p> <p>He wanted to fuck her as much as she wanted to have him fuck her. She would want him, but he wanted to make sure they would be together for a while and let him know if she wanted it. He felt Trish's breasts pressing against his chest below him as they kissed and enjoyed the feeling of her smooth skin pressing against him.</p> <p>"Take it off," he said with his hand still caressing her ass. "I want to see you."</p> <p>"Oh, God," she moaned.</p> <p>He pulled off his sweater and pants, letting his cock brush against her leg and then reached over her and guided and opened her ass cheeks. Trish had already told him if he would take off her underwear, which she had, he could fuck her there. That was his next task and he was now eager to fulfill it as he loved it that way.</p> <p>Her skin was so soft, she was so smooth and he could barely contain himself from taking her there right now. His fingers ran down along and felt the soft texture of her cheeks in the soft fabric. He stroked her flesh and then moved his hand up to her asshole. He could feel the slickness of her pussy as her outer lips separated from her inner ones as he touched her there.</p> <p>His finger ran down to her wet lips which quickly closed back onto his fingers. He could still taste her on his finger as he felt between her legs again.</p> <p>"I want him," she said, "and I want you now."</p> <p>"I'm so wet," he whispered. "Please, can I put some of this inside of me?" he asked.</p> <p>"It'll hurt a little," she replied. Trish moved down between his legs and quickly took his cock in both hands. She could feel his length through the fabric. At first, she teased him with her fingertips, letting them brush against the bottom of his cock as it passed through her fingers. They moved through the fabric a bit further each time, but she stopped only when his ass had been well-hidden underneath his jeans.</p> <p>As they were still kissing, she slid her hands lower until they could feel the top of his chest hairs. She ran her hands over him before lifting her mouth off his cock and slowly moving her wet tongue up as far as she could.</p> <p>"Oh you feel so good," she moaned.</p> <p>"Yes," he replied and began to stroke himself as she continued.</p> <p>There was a difference between a guy and a woman in many ways. Their bodies were different in certain situations and their movementsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
