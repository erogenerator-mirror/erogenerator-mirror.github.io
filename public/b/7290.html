His penis was hard and he needed to be fucked. She was too but that wasn't the right choice of words. The next morning he came into the bar knowing he could fuck her there but still have no choice as she was leaving by three. He knew that they never would be there though.</p> <p>"How many?"</p> <p>"I'm not allowed to ask."</p> <p>"Oh God! I can't tell you how many! This was my first time but not the last. I'm not allowed to ask and yet I want you." She looked at the clock that was displayed on the wall that showed her that she had been waiting for more and had almost gone all night.</p> <p>"I'll be in your area soon but not tonight. I have too many to do if I am still late."</p> <p>"Come here girl!" She stood up and he could see she was still a little sore from that night's activity. She reached behind her back and unclasped her bra but did nothing to put it on. He put his arms around her and she pulled him up to her as the bra fell and crushed her breasts against his body. She could feel the hardness of his penis against her stomach as her head tilted back. He pulled her to him again and the kiss and the hug were gentle, but then they were in a world of their own.</p> <p>When the kiss had ended he pushed her back and pulled her to him and started to undress. She followed them and he quickly and gently removed her remaining clothes, pausing at her breasts to examine them and to let her nipples grow as he saw them stand up.</p> <p>"God I'm horny."</p> <p>"Well let's get on with it. Do you want to fuck me on the bar in the middle of nowhere?" She took of her clothes and as soon as they were on the bar sat down before she could stop him. He lay on his back and looked at her as she lay on top of him.</p> <p>"I have had a lot of guys in my life now and some of them are great but I have only had three and I'm sorry, I can't be that much of a fool."</p> <p>"I'm not either, I really have liked sex but never had it and here is my chance to have it again. You are so sexy and I've never felt this way about another guy before." He pulled her close again and kissed her again.</p> <p>"I've been doing this since I was 18. It was just to get a little more experience. I was always ready for a little adventure." With that she kissed him again.</p> <p>"I hope you are horny and you want to fuck. I can tell we're going to be horny tomorrow!" and with that she raised herself until they were level with his penis and took it into her lips again. He felt every move and every movement her body made as she worked his cock into her mouth and he couldn't get enough of her. She kept it up until he could hold back no longer and he couldn't hold himself long. Her vagina tightened around him in response and her mouth slid off of his cock as he came in her.</p> <p>"Holy shit, that was wonderful." He lay on the floor breathing heavy. Her body quivering in response to the pleasure she felt and the feeling of her pussy contracting and sending him over the edge.</p> <p>When he regained himself he got up and got dressed as she was leaving.</p> <p>"Have you ever been there? I have a special place I want to show you next month, but not right here. I want you to come too." He helped her to her car and they walked through the parking lots together, he walked her into her apartment and they both left shortly after. It had taken almost a month for her to get the nerve to take off with him as she had said and he felt a great deal of satisfaction seeing her come into her apartment naked. They sat at her living room for a long time and had a lot of laughs. She looked at him smiling and asked where he had that coming from.</p> <p>"I was thinking somewhere that you could get naked too."</p> <p>"I like your suggestion and it is going to be very fun, but first, where are we going to do this?"</p> <p>"I had a special place up ahead that I want to show you. It is a new building and a bit out of town but it looks a great place to get out of here, it's beautiful, and of course it is going nude!" She smiled and they got dressed and went to have breakfast.</p> <p>"Let me think about this!"</p> <p>"Don't think about it, just do it and remember that you want to do it anyway, even if you don't want toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
