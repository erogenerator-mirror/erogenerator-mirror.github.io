That finger then moved down along her slit.</p> <p>She started to say something but he pushed his finger back up to his mouth and licked it, which made her suck in her breath. She moaned again.</p> <p>She started again and pulled her hips upward, making him suck harder and deeper. He groaned and licked harder.</p> <p>She began to ride his finger and her hips began to buck against him.</p> <p>She pulled herself free so he could take off her panties. He moaned as she pulled down his pants and took out his cock. She opened her mouth and took him in.</p> <p>Her lips on him made him groan softly. She worked her way up and down, kissing and sucking. It was so good that his cock began to twitch in her mouth.</p> <p>"Mmm," she moaned and sucked even harder. "That's it....suck my cock, baby...fucking suck me...I like that..."</p> <p>He groaned and started to thrust into her mouth, fucking her hard. He began to spank her ass as she continued to suck.</p> <p>"Take it all, baby....take my entire cock down your throat," he demanded.</p> <p>They were both on their elbows trying to take all of it.</p> <p>He was pushing her forward, pushing his cock all the way down her throat. She was moaning with pleasure. His cock was in her mouth, as far as it could go, and she'd taken it all the way down her throat. He moaned and groaned loudly.</p> <p>She loved it and moaned with him. Her throat muscles were tightening, and his cock was throbbing. He was moving almost back, and she kept sucking the head of his cock, her tongue massaging the shaft. He continued to hold her head.</p> <p>Then, he began to pump her mouth, fucking it hard, his cock pulsating. He was going to come again.</p> <p>"Hang on!" he screamed, "I want to come in your mouth, baby," he said, his voice a rasp.</p> <p>She held him in her mouth all the way to the tip, making sure she could feel his hard cock as it pulled out of her mouth for the first time.</p> <p>She took him back down her throat, as deep as she could. Her lips stretched tight around him. She sucked harder and pumped his cock even faster. She wanted to taste him. She was going to do that now.</p> <p>He began to thrust into her mouth, so it made him groan and buck his hips wildly. She kept sucking and he began to cum in her mouth. She took it and swallowed it with great joy and pride.</p> <p>When her mouth was empty, she looked up at him, wanting him to move down and lick her again.</p> <p>"Mmmm," she moaned, "your cock is so nice..."</p> <p>She sat up and kissed him, his lips never parting.</p> <p>"Now, I want to be on top," he said, "And it's my turn," he said.</p> <p>She got up and stood in front of him.</p> <p>"Lie down," he said, smiling up at her.</p> <p>She sat on him, straddling him. She pulled him close and looked down at him.</p> <p>"So nice to have a guy's dick in me again, is that it?" she said.</p> <p>She had to reach around, because he didn't fill all her. It was getting to be a competition between them. He wanted her, she wanted him. But not as much as they had been. It just felt as though they were trying to be one.</p> <p>"Can you make a sandwich?" she asked.</p> <p>"Do you know the best way to make a sandwich? How about you sit on me?" he asked.</p> <p>"I can't," she said.</p> <p>"Then, you can," he said, "I won't do this if you don't. It's my rule."</p> <p>They lay there for a long time looking into each others eyes, trying to get their heart to beat again.</p> <p>"I don't want to go down that road again," he said as he slid on top of her again. "Is that OK?" he asked.</p> <p>She nodded.</p> <p>"We can't," he said, "It's your first time."</p> <p>"Do you love me?" she asked.</p> <p>"I just don't know...and I don't know how to tell you...but, yeah, my heart belongs to you," he said.</p> <p>"How do you feel about me kissing your lips, not going downâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
