It had been just a few months before they had broken up and she had found a job working in a bookstore. They had even gone to a movie to get things started and it seemed the thing they had in mind for the day seemed like an ideal place to begin.</p> <p>They didn't have any more friends or families to join them in the neighborhood and it was only now that the summer had come and it really had turned into a good one. It had also turned out to not be too bad and they had finally found a quiet and safe haven. Her parents had been surprised at the choice of place that they were going to and were disappointed but they were also happy to have a good time. While it had never been planned it had come out in the right place and they knew it was going to be good.</p> <p>All three of them had ended up having a great time that night. They had found a nice spot in the park that allowed their privacy, a small cove off of the main street and, after a lot of discussion between them, they had found a private spot where they could watch the sun coming through the trees. The water was cold but the sun was warm enough that they just stayed in it for an hour or two. It was then that they realized that they would not want to get the water in their hair; they had taken them this way when they had gotten up and just got in the water. Before long, they decided that they would be tired but not sleepy.</p> <p>After that they decided that it would have been ok for them to go back inside and just lie back to relax until around 11am or so. When they got back they found their clothes and grabbed them into the bag and headed back to their cars to get to bed. They had no more than tossed their clothes into the car and jumped into bed. Before they settled down though, they got off the road and headed up into the woods.</p> <p>It was already dark when they got there and they had no idea if they might be seen. That's when it really got interesting. After they checked the perimeter, they heard a man in a voice coming at them before something was thrown on in front of them.</p> <p>Their eyes went wide and they froze. The only thing to do was to look around until they found their way back to where they had been at first and they couldn't see. They were then all confused for a second as they looked around on what they had seen. It was a couple, not married, standing side by side talking.</p> <p>"Hello, you are not expecting us," said another man in what they assumed to be a southern accent. "We are the good citizens of the little country and have taken shelter there. We hope that you enjoyed yourself," told the husband.</p> <p>"We... uh.. we're very... uh sure... there are a lot of things we may want to do, we just don't know them well." said the woman.</p> <p>"You are welcome to join us when we see you, I see that you have been staying close to us," laughed one of the men. "You can come down for dinner if you would like. " He finished as they walked the few feet down the path they had just walked when a noise outside. "Where are we?" questioned the woman as she saw what was coming.</p> <p>She and the others began to enter the woods.</p> <p>They stood there for a minute just staring at the others. The man and woman, they would later find out, were the owners of the bar that had been in their home for the last six months.</p> <p>"What is that noise?" asked the stranger behind them.</p> <p>"Oh, just thought I would help," shrugged the husband.</p> <p>"It sounds like it could come from here," said the man. "Please don't speak about anything, we can answer any questions you have," continued the man.</p> <p>"We've never done this before," the woman said nervously.</p> <p>"No, this should be fine. We need to find you and take you with us." said the man.</p> <p>"No, we can't do that," said the woman.</p> <p>"We will come this way," said the husband. "Please don't speak any more about this. There may be a limit to what you do not say."</p> <p>"Well, it would be a good start then and we will agree to what you need as well. " He said as he grabbed both of the women's hands in his arms and led them quickly down a path that led toward the forest.</p> <p>As soon as they were both on the path, their fear of what might comeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
