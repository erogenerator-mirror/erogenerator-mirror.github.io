"I do admit I'm attracted to you, but I guess I'll never see you again."</p> <p>"Of course not," she said, leaning back in her leather chair.</p> <p>"But I'll wait until tomorrow and we can see the world together," I said, sitting across the counter from her.</p> <p>"That sounds like a good idea. I do like the way you think of yourself. Don't you have a girlfriend?"</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I said as the waiter brought me a drink. "I met her once, on the rebound from a relationship but she left me. She wasn't my girl. I fell on my ass."</p> <p>The waiter brought my drink and we clinked our glasses together. I drained the glass. She refilled hers. I watched as she made sure my glass had all of the ice cubes that I missed because she knew I'd take a drink when my glass was empty.</p> <p>"Is this your friend's friend?" I said to the waiter.</p> <p>"Yeah, she's the one who told me you are single," he said. "Are you coming to live with us?"</p> <p>"I've got two things that I'd like to get done," I said. "Both of these things are important. How about you?"</p> <p>He came over and shook my hand as he said, "Thanks. I'd appreciate that."</p> <p>As soon as the waiter was done, I said, "What makes you guys so much different than you? You know, I think you have a very serious line of people."</p> <p>"That's why we go to a lot of the parties," she said. "We can't keep it from a certain person."</p> <p>"Yes we can," I said, holding her hand as we sipped at our drinks. "That's why we're coming here so late at night because we need to be alone. I've had plenty of guys, too."</p> <p>"And you're the only one who has dated since coming here," she said.</p> <p>"Thank you," I said as I raised my glass.</p> <p>"You're welcome," she said. "I'm not sure if I'm ready to come back to work just so I can see who everybody wants to date."</p> <p>I laughed and said, "I've had plenty of dates. I'm sure most of them haven't had the opportunity to actually find a guy who they would consider dating."</p> <p>She smiled at me. "A lot of women are lonely, are they?" I said.</p> <p>"That's partly their problem. Not everyone wants to date just one guy and not that many men will ever want to give his left leg a break."</p> <p>"You're right," I said.</p> <p>"You're wrong. Some women are the most lonely guys I know," she said.</p> <p>"Thank you for that," I said. "I do feel that way."</p> <p>We finished our meals and I said, "I'm going to go get a shower. I'll be right back."</p> <p>I went into the bathroom and turned on the radio. When I came back to my chair I looked over at her to see if I could detect a change in her mood or not. The waiter was making his usual slow walk across the room stopping to pay the tab from time to time and she had to ask him to take a closer look at me. I turned on the radio to hear the band that I was playing and then went to take my shower. By the time I finished my shower, she was sitting on her couch looking out the window.</p> <p>"What's wrong," I asked without turning around.</p> <p>"Nothing," she said.</p> <p>I got up and went to her. She said, "We can talk about this."</p> <p>After watching for a few moments, I said, "Okay. Why don't you go get yourself some clothes?"</p> <p>"I'm not going to argue with you," she said. "It doesn't matter what we talk about, I'm the one that has to take a shower."</p> <p>"Really?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm going to go get dressed too," she said.</p> <p>"I don't have the key to your apartment so I'll wait in the car for you until we get to the bar," I said. "Where are you going to come up with the drink specials after you get out of the shower?"</p> <p>"I don't know," she said. "It'd be too weird for me at that bar. It sure wouldn't be my first time coming from such a place."</p> <p>"What did you say to the bar ownerâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
