"It was awesome."</p> <p>I started out with the slowest speed I knew, but I could feel her getting very turned on by it and was able to go longer and faster. I could feel her lips pressing down hard against the end of my cock and the first inch or two of my shaft and she started to moan again, but it was more in a whimper as I knew she was about ready to go to the brink.</p> <p>"Oh god." she said. "Ohmygod, yes, please."</p> <p>I was only half moving when Jenny pushed me away quickly and walked over to me. She laid down with her legs spread wide and her fingers deep in her pussy, her head on the pillow and took my cock in a big sloppy kiss. Her eyes were staring right at me and even still a bit shaky from my earlier ejaculation, I could tell all she was thinking was "oh my god" for the first time and I liked what she was seeing.</p> <p>"Oh my god." she said again and opened her mouth wide. "Oh my god."</p> <p>I let her mouth go and moved in slowly, not wanting to over react as she was a little uncomfortable at first. I slid all the way in her mouth, feeling her tongue pressing hard against the sides of my shaft and she pulled off and started sucking me very slowly, sucking gently until I got about halfway out of her mouth and then letting it all the way back in, working her way up until just the head of my shaft was touching the back of her throat. I stopped and held her there.</p> <p>"Go slow." I said. "I want to do something that's just a bit different and you're the same way."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>It had actually felt pretty good to do when my wife was licking my cock and then getting it into my mouth, but I felt I hadn't really given Jenny this much experience like I wanted. She sucked so hard, so slowly, and her moans told me that she was pretty close as well. I started sliding back and forth just a tad a few more inches when she moved her mouth away from my cock and put her feet on my ass.</p> <p>"You have a beautiful cock. The head is so big compared to yours. Go slow, take in a breath." she said.</p> <p>She started to move her body up and down faster on my cock with every stroke, and I could feel how wet her pussy was. She was really working it, sucking it hard and fast with the thumb and index finger of one hand around the bottom of my shaft, gripping the back of it. Her other hand was kneading a breast, pulling the nipple, while squeezing and twisting the other and it took all of my strength to keep still while she worked herself like a whore.</p> <p>"Uh, uh, uh, uh!" she said over and over, working to make it last as long as she could, "Uhn, what are you looking at? Uh oh, yes, yes, yes, yes," she said, "You see what you didn't think you were doing? He's got a great big cock. It really fits in to you! It's about to cum! Oh god oh god!" and she squeezed her pussy together even tighter, pulling more juices into her and making my balls tighten up again.</p> <p>She stopped and held my cock in the air, looking at me with her big eyes.</p> <p>"Don't stop, don't stop."</p> <p>She didn't, she was on the edge again just looking at me. I could tell as she got even more frantic and her chest was heaving as the force that had been building up to orgasm started. Her mouth was open.</p> <p>"I can't!" she said. "My legs are off the bed."</p> <p>"Oh god Jenny, no, you're going to catch yourself. Take your hand off your tit and put it back where it was. It's okay. It hurts."</p> <p>She put her hands back down on the bed and didn't say anything as she concentrated, moving her body up and down, squeezing her breast even harder, working up and down with her thumb and forefinger and rubbing up and down between her lips again and again and again.</p> <p>"Uh, uh, uh, uh." she said, "I think I'm about going to cum. Uhn, uh oh my god."</p> <p>"Not yet, Jenny." I said soothingly. "You can have me after that. It's okay."</p> <p>She nodded her head, and when I let go of her breast and put my hand under her, she immediately lifted her leg and dropped her pussy onto my fingers and started to grind. I could feel it sliding on the slick juices that were running down the insides of her thighs, the slippery lips opening under the skin asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
