As soon as she started to relax I reached around and untied the two sides of the bow. She helped by taking the loose ends of the bow, and slipping the bow off. As the dress fell loosely on her, her arms lay out to the sides.</p> <p>"Do I look as sexy as your wife?" I asked.</p> <p>"Much, better than your wife," she answered softly.</p> <p>As she was beginning to sit down after dropping her husband, I moved behind her, kneeling on the rug at the edge of the sofa. Leaning forward, I pulled her onto my lap facing me. "If my wife were here, you'd be sitting up, and I could be licking your pussy," I said. Leaning over, I took one arm and draped it over her middle, bringing her nipple up so it grazed my cheek. "If she were here," I whispered into her ear, "I love the feel of your tits on my body. I can't get over how much I would like to fuck you."</p> <p>"It's ok honey," she breathed, and with that she turned my chin up, tilting my face up a little more. Looking into my eyes, she kissed me gently, and as she did so her hand began to wander down over that body.</p> <p>"Mmmm, mmm," she moaned as her hand moved down and cupped her pussy. She parted those dark labia as her fingers toyed with her clit while they toyed with the entrance to her pussy. She slowly pushed her fingers into her pussy, moaning as she got a finger coated in her juice. I took her arm and guided her down until she was sitting on my thighs.</p> <p>Holding her back as she leaned back against me again, I began to rock my knee up and down letting her grind her pussy back against my legs. "How does that feel?" I asked.</p> <p>"It feels wonderful," she smiled. "Don't stop," she panted.</p> <p>"My wife never liked me to go down on her," I continued as I began to play with her breast again. I began to softly roll each nipple in my fingers, pulling almost all of it into my mouth. "God." I continued to softly suckle each breast before moving myself down again, letting my tongue slip out to her exposed clit and start to flick over it. I could feel her muscles tighten just a bit as my tongue rolled over her little nub and finally she started to push back against my leg.</p> <p>"Oh God that feels so fucking good," she cried.</p> <p>I continued to run my tongue across her clit, moving in small circles letting the tip of my tongue tickle and tease her button until I could feel the muscles inside begin to tense. As she was getting nearer to her orgasm, I put my tongue in her pussy and began licking her entire pussy from her perineum to her clit, flicking at the tip repeatedly, alternating between each one.</p> <p>"Oh God, you make me feel so fucking good," she cried as she pushed my head away from her body.</p> <p>"What about your husband?" I thought to ask.</p> <p>I could only groan and tell her that she said it as a question, so I told her it would always feel great to come like that. She just groaned and moaned as she pushed back against my tongue. I didn't wait as she moved back onto my thighs and pushed her fingers back into her pussy. I let her grind on me for a little while longer, but quickly stopped, letting her relax a little. When I was ready, I reached down to her crotch, and pulled up just enough to let her fingers slide out with a slight pop, and slid them under my stomach. My own pussy was throbbing already, but I kept it mostly dry. I reached down the inside of her legs again to grab my vibrator and put it on the couch beside us.</p> <p>She was just about to move when I picked her up, pulled her onto the couch with me, and bent down to kiss her. She could taste her own pussy juices on my lips, and just before I kissed her, I pulled away.</p> <p>"Can I watch you eat me?" she asked.</p> <p>"Of course, you just stay here," I answered, looking deep into her eyes.</p> <p>As I kissed her her, I reached underneath her and began to run my fingertips up her legs to her warm, moist opening. First I lightly caressed the inside of one leg, just a little, almost barely touching her as she let out a sound and spread her legs a little more. I moved my kisses to the other leg, doing the same, and then moved back downâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
