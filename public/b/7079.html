"Fuck," he said and started thrusting harder, "that's it, baby. Ride me. Ride my cock. Your pussy is so good I could fuck this all night. We need to get back to your place so we can have some fun." He pulled on her hair, pulling her against his chest as he pushed deeper inside of her. He was still for a few moments, his thrusts long but slow, as he began to thrust harder into her. It felt so good he thought, as his fingers slid into the sweat-slick strands of her hair. He pushed into her with long, deep thrusts, holding his cock deep inside of her before starting to grind against her.</p> <p>Rushing to his feet, he picked her up a bit and sat down on the edge of the couch before sitting on his knees himself. He put them in between the couch and chair, and wrapped his arms around her legs. He lowered his face into her pussy and started to lick her, sucking his lips and tongue as she spread her legs wider. He felt her hips start to move against him. The taste was amazing. His tongue explored her pussy, moving quickly inside of her as she gasped under his attack on her clit. He ran his tongue across her clit a bit more, taking it between his teeth to lightly tug on it before pulling it back into the opening of his mouth, sucking it. He flicked his tongue against it again, causing her hips to jerk upward a bit more.</p> <p>She pulled his head tightly against her, trying to get him inside her as she bucked and moaned beneath him. He moved his fingers up inside her, rubbing her clit with one hand. He moved his tongue down to her hole a little farther than he had started, and when he found it, he began to suck on it. He continued to rub her clit, but moved his tongue lower in between her legs.</p> <p>He moved his finger up in between them, but instead of pushing inside of her he rubbed in circles around her clit and clit, moving just around it and over it. He was teasing her. He was making her wild. She was whimpering for him, begging him to fuck her. "Baby... I'm going to come."</p> <p>He smiled at her, taking his tongue and rubbing his fingers against her clit again.</p> <p>"Don't I deserve your attentions?" he asked before leaning back to run them along her lips, down her thigh and back up again.</p> <p>"God yes! Oh God... Just like that... Just like that." she moaned as she reached for his hand as she pulled it against her. She felt his finger push up between her lips and press up into her before moving around inside of her making circles around her clit before sliding up inside of her deeper than he had been before. Her hips pushed up against him again and again, trying to force more of his finger into her. The feeling of him inside of her set her off and she nearly came right then and there. She felt his finger move slowly in and out of her and her back muscles contracted around it causing him to start moving inside of her just far enough to rub against her very sensitive spot. "Oh, oh god..." she gasped, feeling it build up out of her and into the feeling she was sure was coming through his hand.</p> <p>She felt it building up in her, making her feel everything she was feeling. Her eyes closed tightly and she gasped again and again. Her face contorted as she felt herself come again. Her pussy clamped down around his finger and her hips pushed up against him as she rode the pleasure through her. He stopped for a moment and she lifted her hips off of his finger, letting him keep it inside of her as her orgasm finally started coming back. Her whole body tensed up and she shuddered as her orgasm swept over her.</p> <p>"Fuck!" she managed with her eyes still closed.</p> <p>He let go of her legs and knelt up from the couch. He gently pushed the rest of his body back on to the couch as she sat there, her fingers still playing in his hair. When he got on the couch back, he took her hand and held it to his mouth. He began to kiss her hands like he was kissing her pussy. He slowly put her hands back on to his face, looking up at her.</p> <p>"Are you okay?" he said, rubbing her hands.</p> <p>"Don't stop!" she said softly. "Don't stop. Don't stop. Make me come again. Please."</p> <p>"Do you want me to do that again until I feel like I'm on my way to heaven?" he asked with a grin.</p> <p>"Do whatever you wantâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
