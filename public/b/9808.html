I haven't had a proper dinner all night, that's all."</p> <p>The girls laughed, knowing it was true.</p> <p>"Well, I think I'll find you a nice place to stay tonight," said Julie.</p> <p>"Thanks, Julie," said the older woman. I'll keep you company for the time you've been on your honeymoon. Then I have a couple of guests to see. Don't ask, do you?"</p> <p>"Just remember no panties, understand?" said Julie.</p> <p>She had an easy way of flirting with the two women. They had a mutual smile upon first seeing them. After Julie had gotten to a booth they all talked for a bit. Julie had the same idea. She went to the ladies room and, after washing up a bit, went and told them she was ready for a drink that evening. Julie went to the ladies room and turned on the hot water and took a shower. She was very clean.</p> <p>After taking a quick shower she went to the sink and applied her makeup. Then she dressed to look her best. She went and met her lover. She found him sitting at a red velvet couch. He looked up as she came in.</p> <p>"Hi, I'm Bill, nice to see you again and also to see your friend, Kim."</p> <p>"Kim. Nice to meet you too," she said in her girlish accent.</p> <p>"I'll call you tonight," Bill said</p> <p>"Can't you just say you're on vacation?"</p> <p>"There are a few things I needed to show you that I can't do."</p> <p>"I've had them too," he said with a smile.</p> <p>Kim smiled. "You know I've already checked up on you, don't you?"</p> <p>"Yeah," he laughed nervously. "Your sister and husband were in Europe last week. I've always wanted to do that."</p> <p>"I see. Kim tells me you've been enjoying your stay with us for a while. That must be fun." Kim laughed. "Let's go and get your room to ourselves and meet some friends there."</p> <p>"Yeah, good idea," Bill agreed. He was hoping they would join them at their hotel room. He had never had a real threesome. He didn't know if he would like it, but he was sure they wouldn't mind. Kim smiled and added, "I can tell."</p> <p>"You are such a flirt," Bill said excitedly.</p> <p>After a few minutes they all got out and sat on the couch and Bill watched as his younger sister played with Julie while she chatted with Julie. Julie had a hard time listening. As she came into the living room a few minutes later Bill and Julie had their arms around each other. He could see Kim was still holding his sister's hand. Their eyes locked. Kim blushed.</p> <p>"Don't you think he's a nice, handsome man, Bill?" said Julie.</p> <p>"Well, if you and he ever get together again," Bill agreed, "he won't mind, right Julie?"</p> <p>"Not a bit," she said. "He's never had a girlfriend before, and we do take a little swing. Maybe you and I would like to take him over to the Hotel here in town for a couple days."</p> <p>"Well, I guess it's ok Julie. I really don't mind if you and I go there."</p> <p>"Good heavens, no we don't," Kim said with an excited laugh. "I've heard about the Hotel Club so I'll talk to my sisters and see what happens. Bill, will you join us, we would love to have you join us."</p> <p>Kim and her sister got up. Bill followed. They had some drinks by the side of the room. The three of them chatted for several minutes. Then Julie walked off. Bill and Kim took turns walking around the living room. Bill and Kim stood watching the two women walk off.</p> <p>"So have Julie and Bill enjoyed their stay?" asked Julie.</p> <p>"Well, let's just say they have a very nice time. We'll see you and your friends later."</p> <p>Kim walked with Julie and Bill into her room. Bill followed Bill in and Julie and Bill were alone in the living room.</p> <p>"Why don't you and Bill take off these clothes," said Julie.</p> <p>They began to undress, undressing each other, watching Julie. The boys were really looking at their sexy sister and loving it. The two women were naked and were looking at each other's hard nipples. Bill, who couldn't take his eyes off this gorgeous blonde beauty, was the center of attention and his cock was hard again.</p> <p>"Get us each some water," said Julie. Once they were both in the wet tub Julie handed Billâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
