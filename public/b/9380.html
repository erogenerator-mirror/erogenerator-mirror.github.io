Do you like it when I finger-fuck you?"</p> <p>I didn't know how to respond to that. I was so caught up in the sensations and sounds that I didn't think I was going to try and talk anymore. I didn't think I'd be able to stop myself with a word.</p> <p>"Yes!" I finally managed to reply to her question. "All the way!"</p> <p>She was smiling a mile a minute at her own response, and nodded again as if it had been the most natural thing in the world to do the next step.</p> <p>She pulled out one of her vibrating butt plugs. "This one's a friend from when I started going on dates. I'm going to do some shopping. Get some new lingerie!"</p> <p>The way she was taking things, I'd think my eyes were going to pop out of my head.</p> <p>But then something that made everything else all that more difficult came to me. I felt my heart begin to beat again. Her ass was so tight and sweet, that I couldn't help but imagine that it had been a year or two since the last man had been inside of it.</p> <p>The more that I looked down, and my dick started to stir, the more I realized the more that came to me. I couldn't be thinking anything of it now. All I could think of with absolute clarity was her.</p> <p>"OK... OK, you know I don't think it's really necessary to know what this is... I'll be done with it... right?"</p> <p>"Sure... what would you need... anything?" she said, and I could tell she'd been joking.</p> <p>"Uh... would you like me to do the thing a friend of mine in my life would use? Make it come out in one long slow motion? Or..."</p> <p>"Put it back in. Now! Oh, oh, ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh," she said, and pushed it back into my ass again.</p> <p>She turned it on! The sudden shocker to the shocker! I jerked forward. It was really hard to say anything at that moment. I kept struggling and squirming in my bonds.</p> <p>"Oh shit... Oh no... No... No..." I gasped out, then again when I heard the unmistakable sounds of something being pushed through the hole in the wall.</p> <p>And suddenly there was a bright light. I didn't know who it was, and I struggled and made futile attempts.</p> <p>"NO! No! You can't! Stop! Don't... Stop! I'm coming!" I squealed out, then I felt her fingers, as she touched me. And I was so surprised that I didn't protest her touch, and for a millisecond, I found that I was holding myself in place with fear. No, the feeling she was giving me was something else entirely.</p> <p>And then the light blinked off. The room was lighted, but was still dimly bright, or maybe it was dark inside. I could still hear a car rummaging around inside the room. It was all so strange, and yet so real. I tried to find something to talk to her, and I was in a strange sort of dilemma. Could I tell her and I could stop this... this thing? What was going to happen? Is she going to tell those people in the building about us now, and we'll never return?</p> <p>Before I could think of anything or say anything at all, she let go of my arm, turned back to me and looked me in the eye.</p> <p>"Are you OK? Really?" She smiled. "You were just so helpless, I had no idea..."</p> <p>"No. No, I'm not going anywhere right now... really!" I said, trying to get a hold of myself, as she had done with her finger.</p> <p>There was a brief moment of hesitation and then I felt her hand on my thigh again. Then it was gone, too.</p> <p>"Let me go," I said. I didn't know why, or if I was even able to speak or understand anything, but I didn't try to tell her what to do or say.</p> <p>"No!" I tried again. "Let me go!"</p> <p>"No! It's okay... let me go, it's all right... just... just let me go!"</p> <p>She didn't seem to know what to do or say to make me stop, either. Not so much that I wanted her to touch. And not that she wouldn't have tried, either. That she was the one who was going to be hurt, or that she wouldn't like my way of telling her... it was too much and I couldn't say anything. There was no way back... just to let her go, with me stillâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
