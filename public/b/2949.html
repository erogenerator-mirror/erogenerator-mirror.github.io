I lifted her off me and lay down beside her. My cock still deep inside her.</p> <p>"You can come up to bed now, love" I said. "I need to come, and I'm still hard too."</p> <p>Her eyes opened wide, then closed, her mouth moved back and down onto mine. I could feel the passion in the kiss. The first signs of her desire.</p> <p>In all the time we'd been together, she'd never kissed me like that, never stopped loving me, never let me go, never stopped taking me. It was as if our lips never stopped kissing. She wanted everything, from my lips to my cock, everywhere, and she knew it. She wanted me to use her body to make her cum, to fuck her.</p> <p>She moved herself up a little so she could wrap her legs around me and begin to move with me, in the same rhythm as her body would have moved.</p> <p>"Make me cum, baby, make me cum", she cried.</p> <p>I fucked her.</p> <p>My hands explored her body until they reached her breasts again, and she groaned into my mouth, "Yes, yes, Yes, yes." She arched her back and she wrapped her arms to my back, pulling me closer towards her with each thrust. It was a good thing we were in a 69 position.</p> <p>I took one of her breasts in my mouth and sucked the nipple, gently at first but with increasing fervor every time.</p> <p>Gratefully, she reached down and began to massage my cock. It was a pleasure to fuck her like this, in her own bed in this moment. At the same time, her fingers moved over my hips, to grab my balls one at a time, and tease my cock through the thin membrane of skin that separated us.</p> <p>When all but my fingertips could take me, she reached down to the bedside drawer and picked up something else. My face went with it. She lay next to me in the middle of the bed and began to kiss me again, her body in such a way that she couldn't get enough contact with me. She'd always loved kissing and lapping my cock. It just wasn't what she wanted and needed.</p> <p>She sat up again. Her legs went to my hips and she pulled me towards her as she kissed me all over. She moved to the end of the bed and pushed her legs apart so that her cunt was above me. We lay there together, kissing and stroking each other, until she broke the kiss.</p> <p>"I want to feel you deep inside me. Fill me with your cock".</p> <p>I did. I lifted her hips and slid deep inside her wet cunt, lifting her until her mouth was near hers. We kissed for a minute. I kissed her, tasting myself on her lips. We kissed again. We kissed and kissed with more passion, longer than the first.</p> <p>Finally, a little more of me slid up inside her, deeper than when we had been on our back in the middle of the living room in our bedroom. She had opened up to me, she'd opened to me as much as I had ever been to her.</p> <p>I pushed my cock deeper inside her, into the back of her cunt, till she had to have my whole cock inside her. I began to thrust harder into her, until we had all the passion of a lover.</p> <p>"Fuck me, fuck me", she called. She moved her arms to me. "Put your cock deep inside me. Fill me up."</p> <p>I began to pound into her, my cock was getting harder against her clit, and the tip of it was poking against her cervix.</p> <p>"Yes", she called again. "Fill me with it".</p> <p>I pushed harder. I pulled her legs hard against me and she put a hand to her mouth to stifle the sounds coming from her throat, but all she could say was, "Harder".</p> <p>I pumped harder. I pounded into her until my cock was as deep as it would go and my balls slapped her ass. Then she began screaming so loud I almost panicked, I didn't want to be discovered. It's the sound of a woman's orgasmic shouts.</p> <p>I don't know how long I fucked, we lay there together. We kissed and kissed until our breath had returned to normal. Our legs intertwined and we rubbed our chests in that same way that we had done in the bathroom and the hallway.</p> <p>"I love you, Paul, I love you" she cried, falling on me.</p> <p>So I told her I loved her - I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her and I wanted to make love to her all the timeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
