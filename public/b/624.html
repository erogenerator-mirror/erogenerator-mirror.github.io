I could hear the fear in her voice. "Your life is only getting harder!" she added in a cold voice before I could put in a verbal reply to what she wanted to hear.</p> <p>"Now you can't make a move on me. I am your protector." There was a huge smile in her tone of voice that told me it was going to be okay.</p> <p>"What exactly are you doing here? How come you could go to such lengths to protect me from my sister?"</p> <p>"I am your protector, and there is nothing your sister could ever do but to protect you and protect you from your sisters." I could see in her eyes that I had made my point and that I would protect her.</p> <p>"Well, you have to get your things then, and leave, I just want to be alone for a few days to allow me to catch up with mom."</p> <p>"How about I bring you some clothes so you won't have to go to the store by yourself? If you want those things, then we are even!" and she was quickly getting my wallet and some cash. She took my bag and led me down the stairs and gave me the bag she had in her room. I knew that as soon as I was gone that mom would be going crazy and would want to kill me and she would also be going to the store because I wanted to be alone.</p> <p>"Are you going out the door to get some food?" My mother asked as she was opening the door to her apartment.</p> <p>"Of course, get some food and get ready to go see some friends. I'll be back here in about ten." Mom told me as she moved out the door.</p> <p>*</p> <p>I got back to my apartment before mom left, it was one of the first classes I got as I got out of my room. I knew that I wouldn't be home until five so I walked into the kitchen and quickly filled a bowl with warm liquid, before I poured myself a glass of water. I put the bowl in the fridge and sat down on the sofa to relax before I was in the middle of my own small talk with some friends.</p> <p>While drinking my water, I could hear mom getting ready to leave. With my head down I started to hear the shower turn on when I heard mom call, "Bathroom, Mom!"</p> <p>There was a slight knock at the door so I opened it to my aunt's room and could see her as she pulled on a pair of jeans and a top that she had on over a t-shirt she left on her pillow. I saw the two sets of light blue jeans being thrown across the room from my sister which didn't surprise me since they only had an inch or two of fabric. I could make out mom's t-shirt which was a little too long for her slender body. She had on a pair of dark blue sneakers that were as light blue as the top of her button down shirt. Mom pulled on her black t-shirt and then went and changed into it. "Well, well, well. How do you like my new outfit? Do you like what I am wearing?" Mom asked as she walked across the kitchen to where the door was.</p> <p>I saw that she had on dark blue flip flops with black tennis shoes with dark blue nail polish and her feet were painted a red color that matched her hair. I could see that she had black shoulder high socks on that had a strap in the center, but it was hard to tell. The other thing that really caught my attention was the fact that instead of putting on underwear, mom wore panties! A smile crept onto my face to see that I was shocked but was also excited for her to get out of her clothes and wear what she had on. She must have just figured that we didn't want her to hide her secret, at least when she was hiding in our apartment.</p> <p>"I thought you were just going to go out for food or something like that. You look terrific, mom!" I said as she turned around to see me staring at what I was looking at. She was completely naked and standing there with just her panties on. The look in her eye told me that she had been expecting to have me catch her but I didn't because I just wanted to see her naked. My mother was standing in front of me in just her panties showing everything to me!</p> <p>"Oh, you must like what just happened. I thought you were going to leave the door open so I could get a quick look into your bathroom to see if you were really naked." Mom said smiling knowing that my eyes were on her body. "I know you had a chance to do it before we even got out of the shower." she added.</p> <p>"Oh, you're right.
