She parted her lips to accept it and her warm tongue slipped between mine. My hands slid down her smooth back while the fingers of her right hand explored her own breasts.</p> <p>Our tongues and lips mated, and when she came back from the kiss and felt my erection pushing against her pussy the pressure of her crotch increased again as she spread her legs until she was kneeling in front of me and the tip of my cock was pressing between her lips.</p> <p>“Come on,” she said, looking up at me through hooded eyelashes, “come on.”</p> <p>I stood, stepped back to give her room and felt my cock against her pussy as she positioned herself over me.</p> <p>“Take it easy,” she said, “I want to take it hard.”</p> <p>“OK.” I said.</p> <p>I was amazed at the sensation of her tight, warm cunt engulfing my cock. I almost came immediately as my cock bottomed out.</p> <p>“Harder!” she moaned as her eyes rolled back and she dropped her head again. “Ooooh-oh-oh-oh!” she cried, her hands running through my hair.</p> <p>“It feels so good. I want it all the way.” I said. “So you can do me, too.”</p> <p>She didn’t say anything but her pussy convulsed and I felt the liquid slosh under my cock. Her pussy clutched it and sent waves of pleasure through my entire body. It throbbed and spasmed and she whimpered, the tiniest of sighs.</p> <p>“Oh!” she gasped, panting loudly again. “It-it feels so good!”</p> <p>We stayed like that, not moving but I couldn’t move.</p> <p>I glanced down at her tits, which were still pressed firmly against my chest and felt her breasts shake as she heaved.</p> <p>“Your breasts. . ." she said breathlessly, licking her lips.</p> <p>“They’re really nice.”</p> <p>She smiled at me. "How does it feel?” she asked.</p> <p>She sat on top of me and wrapped her arms around me. “Your cock seems to be hard again,” she murmured, caressing my face gently. “I think we’ll both love it!”</p> <p>We kissed and caressed until I was half-hard and she was moaning again. I felt her fingers slide along the length of my cock, which by then was still wet from her juices.</p> <p>“I think that we should do this,” she said. “I mean, it may be wrong but it can't hurt a bit.”</p> <p>“I guess our first date and I might as well try.”</p> <p>She stepped back away from me, leaned forward again and started to strip.</p> <p>“Don’t you want to feel good?” she asked.</p> <p>“Oh, I do.”</p> <p>“Come on,” she said, reaching behind her to begin to unfasten the bra buttons.</p> <p>In a moment I was naked and on my back on the sofa, with my feet on the floor but my cock still standing at attention. As I watched my new girlfriend undress, I reached down and started to caress myself but she put a hand on my shoulder.</p> <p>“No.”</p> <p>“No?” I prompted.</p> <p>“I just want to see what you’d like to see.”</p> <p>“Don�—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
