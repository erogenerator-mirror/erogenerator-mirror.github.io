His jaw dropped and his eyes bulged, even from this low vantage point.</p> <p>'Oh yeah, that would be great!'</p> <p>He was speechless, not even sure what to feel, what to do. He felt himself being pushed from behind and on to the ground.</p> <p>'Oh god, what have I done.' He thought, then remembered her, sitting on a kitchen chair next to the dining table. He felt dizzy, he felt as if he was walking to her. He looked around.</p> <p>She was sitting on the edge of the chair, leaning against it, looking at a magazine. She was wearing a pair of shorts and a top with the word 'Likes" on it which she had obviously pulled off while he was on the floor.</p> <p>There was a short gap between them, she was leaning more against the table edge, a foot shorter and a bit more weight on it. As he moved he was able to reach around and get his hands behind her back, cupping her tits, he felt that tingling that she had experienced on the first time he had played with them.</p> <p>His erection was rising, as with his mind already clouded, he felt that all too familiar tingle as it would happen with her. He looked away in mock embarrassment.</p> <p>'I want you.' his mind was clear.</p> <p>'Can I just suck on those nipples?'</p> <p>His answer was to move around. She leaned down, lifting one tit and then the other, his mouth took an immediate liking to them. She took one nipple between his lips and gently rolled it with his tongue. He felt it swell in his mouth as he suckled her. She moaned and sighed with pleasure and as he did so, she unbuttoned her top and, opening it, removed it. Standing he went to her right breast, taking the turgid nipple from his lips and squeezing. It was hard and full. He was fascinated and aroused by how it stiffened, as he felt his own prick throbbing in front of him. He was amazed. Just to feel her nipple in his mouth and to see it hard and swollen.</p> <p>He bent down to kiss her and she held his head. He kissed her with a passion, he kissed her deeply and he tasted the sweet taste of her juice. As they kissed she took his penis, still limp in his hands, and held it in the palm of her hand. She moved down to a kneeling position and took his dick in her lips. She moved it up and down in her mouth then ran her tongue at the base and licked the head and shaft.</p> <p>He lay back, his hands caressing her hair. She looked up at him with his penis in her mouth and slowly and methodically sucked on it. Her head moving up and down, up and down. Taking him deeper into her mouth, feeling her tongue licking the shaft, sliding up and down the underside of his length. She lifted her mouth and slowly sucked on the head of his penis. He took the nipple into his mouth and suckled her again, as she pulled her mouth away. She pulled more and harder now, she looked up him at him, eyes glittering, he loved her eyes and her smile, looking at him.</p> <p>She stood to a kneeling position, then took him in her hand leading his cock into her mouth. He could feel her lips around him. She had him in the palm of one hand and was massaging him, stroking him and making him hard. She was looking up at him as she sucked him. He had to control himself now. He pulled her on to her hands and knees. She was facing him. His prick was fully inside her. She moved herself down until she was leaning in the seat of the chair. She turned herself round.</p> <p>'Can I see you come, I want to see.' he asked. She was leaning back and she had one hand gripping her own breast the other hand was behind his back, pulling his ass to her. He could see her pussy from where he was. He could see the lips of her pussy, swollen open with her arousal; the clit engorged and pink. He saw her wet pussy. He loved the taste, her juice there. He watched his dick slide in and out of her pussy. He knew he was going to come. He moaned with a deep longing as he exploded inside her, filling her. She held his spurting penis in her hand until he was empty. He moaned softly with pleasure as his cock softened inside her pussyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
