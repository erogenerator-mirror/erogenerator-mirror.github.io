It's about us and how she feels. I wanted to tell her I loved her, because that would have hurt. I wanted to tell her that everything will work out. I wanted to tell her that there are better things that are best and that I'm always looking out for you, but more importantly I wanted her to know I had my heart for her and how much she means to me. If only for the two of us.</p> <p>“Karen” I smiled, “I’m not done talking, so please, kiss me please.”</p> <p>Karen turned my face and looked deeply into my eyes, her face a soft smile. She started slowly and her lips came down and caressed my mouth. Her tongue touched me with just the tip of it and I moaned. She lifted her head at the first lick of her tongue and the sensation almost took my breath away. I grabbed her and pulled her tight against me.</p> <p>It felt so right. It was like no other experience I felt in a long time. She broke the kiss and sat back on the floor, “You are so much better than that jerk.”</p> <p>She said it again in a low soft voice, but she put her hand on my cheek and kissed me on the mouth. I loved the way that felt. I turned and kissed her long luscious lips. Our tongues danced, and she rubbed my breasts through my clothes. We fell back against the door frame and kissed for a long minute. She pulled away and looked me in the eyes with those killer eyes.</p> <p>“I want you so much and I feel like I couldn't touch without your help, I feel like I could die without you here any more.”</p> <p>She leaned forward kissing me again, just a gentle kiss. Suddenly she leaned back leaving my chest feeling cold.</p> <p>“I’m not the kind of person to give up on a single thing.” She giggled, but I saw that smirk.</p> <p>“Oh, I don’t think you’re the type to give up on anything, but I think you can’t wait.” Her eyes darkened a bit, “And I have to tell you, I loved that kiss, but what makes me so happy is that I never want to stop loving you”</p> <p>She stood and pulled her dress off over her head and it dropped to the floor. My eyes were drawn to her breasts and the nipples I kissed. God, they were so fucking big. That was when I saw a small, dark mole on one tit. She slid back down to her knees and leaned back against her desk.</p> <p>“Well Karen, is it time for me to take care of that for you? Are you sure you should want me to take care of that”?” I questioned her with a pout on my lips, but she just smiled down at me and continued.</p> <p>“Go put something I can smell and maybe we can get it on, okay lover?”</p> <p>I smiled and went back to get the panties. I put them on and slid the little box inside. It didn’t take long for me to smell it and it smelled like heaven and I smiled from ear to ear remembering how that felt. I pulled the skirt up and started to put her panties on but her hands on my hips stopped me.</p> <p>“Please don’t. I love you so, please don’t take this away from me.”</p> <p>I was totally confused because she said that. My heart was beating like a jackhammer and I felt like I needed to go back to work but she just smiled at me and got on to the couch. She lay down and spread her legs. I stared at her beautiful pussy and saw how tiny it was. As I slid my face into her soft flesh that was getting wetter and wetter. Then I felt it. She was hot, so tight there. God, I didn't know how on earth it could wrap itself around me, it was so tight. I slid my tongue between her lips and tasted the sweet juices. They tasted so good, like sweet juice. This was like being in heaven.</p> <p>She pushed her pussy against my face and I licked her until she came loudly.</p> <p>“Mmmmmmmm, you taste so good baby." She moaned, "You have something right in there that I can keep right here".</p> <p>I pulled her hips closer and plunged my tongue as deep as I could into her waiting pussy. Her juices were dripping on to my mouth. She cried out, "Don’t quit lover", while I continued to lick her. It felt so good and so damn good all at the same—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
