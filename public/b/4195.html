I felt his fingers go straight to my stomach. Slowly he got lower still and I shivered as it went there. He was getting a lot of attention. I didn't want it, this wasn't normal. "I don't think I feel anything like this." He said, his hand still there; his fingers lightly stroking over my skin; his head still close to mine. "And, I don't know about the rest of you. For starters, you're all staring... at my body. You should be so lucky... to have such a beautiful body. My body should be perfect without a single piece of clothing that doesn't come down to my ass... and my... I'm a... a girl I think. I'm a girl who thinks I'm cute... and I really think that's the way I feel and..." I trailed off.</p> <p>All of them stopped talking. All were staring, and their eyes seemed to stare like a hungry rabbit. That's when I realized I had not said anything. I guess they had figured something out, because a moment later, they were both whispering to one another, saying something... I don't remember, I think they were whispering to each other.</p> <p>"Come with us," I said.</p> <p>"Where?" he asked, his voice soft.</p> <p>"To the pool for a little bit. It's late."</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"The game's about to end," I said. "Do you wanna do it?"</p> <p>"Of course. What can it hurt?"</p> <p>"Well, I've seen what I liked in girls before so I figured it might be fun. I mean I haven't found any real competition, but if they get in trouble with me..." He started to look at me again, with a strange expression. "... then I want them in trouble." He took my hand and led me to his dorm room which was quite impressive. When we get to the pool, he opens the door and turns it from one room to the other. When I finally got too my hand over my eyes, he looks at me and smiles. He takes my hand again and brings me to a sitting position in one of the chairs by the pool.</p> <p>"I hope I'm going to get good at swimming." He took my hand again, and started to slowly remove his t-shirt, which left him completely naked in front of me. "Come with me," I say, and he does, pulling me by the hand. We get a little further away from the rest of the rest of the party, though. We go through the pool, taking in the sounds, and just trying to figure out which of us were the more nervous, the nervous and the excited. The girl who was there already was making the most of the cool water. She's still in her robe and has on the smallest bikini I've ever seen; she's standing near me. I don't think she's as tiny under the sheer material. A nice tight body. She's sitting up and still trying to come up with a name, which I don't want to think about yet. She is looking at us with a smile on her face when she's asked who the other guy is and I get confused. So I ask her who it was to be our date. Which she says was the other guy... which I assume means my guy. She tells me it's really a new girl, her name is Jenny and that she's eighteen, and she's got a boyfriend.</p> <p>We sit down, having a little break from the party. When I sit close to her, there is this way I can get my thighs very close together; my legs are almost touching (for all the water has melted or something). I can feel a little electric current going through me. She reaches up and lightly touches my arm, and I pull her close to me. We were just watching the other's hands. And, looking at all of the people. The fact that we were all so close. And that we were there just to stare at each other. My lips are just inches apart and everything looks just so perfect. I look down at her breasts in particular and suddenly the vision goes into her eyes. One part of me wanted to run away like the scared little girl that I am, but the other part, because I thought he wanted me to hold on.</p> <p>"Wow," I say as she starts to move in the other's lap.</p> <p>"Mmmm," she replies. I can't really tell what she's saying because she's holding me closer, just barely. I close my eyes, and put my hand on her thigh. I know where to touch. There's nobody else nearby butâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
