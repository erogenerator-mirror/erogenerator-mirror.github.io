"Thank you for the offer, but don't you think I'm going to have to go to college for the rest of the summer?"</p> <p>"You are a bright young lady," Tim said. "It's so nice to meet you."</p> <p>They shook hands and she turned around to get out of the limo, leaving the driver in the driver's seat, and turned to greet the young couple once again.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Tim watched as his wife made her way across the courtyard to the library, just as she was walking in the other direction. She was dressed in a simple skirt and top, and had obviously worn no panties. She approached Tim, and, after letting her eyes linger a moment on his face, gently said,</p> <p>"I'd like to know if my offer is still accepted."</p> <p>"Sure, ma'am, I guess it's time and money. My name's Tim and I'll take you to see the library."</p> <p>The two of them went down the hall to the library, where Tim sat down on the sofa. He reached over and slid his hand down his wife's backside while she slipped into her chair, next to him.</p> <p>"Is it okay if I look? Can you show me and make me feel as though I'm special," she asked, her voice soft with nervousness, as if not certain of her own intentions.</p> <p>Tim thought carefully about the very important things she just asked herself for, what she was thinking, and how she was feeling. He didn't have an answer or answer to offer, except that he didn't know how to express what he was feeling, other than that he wasn't sure of himself at all.</p> <p>When Tim was sure, he sat there holding both of his wife's hands, hoping she didn't feel him up any more than he'd hoped she did. She sat there for several minutes, her fingers touching his.</p> <p>"I think I'm ready for all of this," he finally said. "Can I kiss you?"</p> <p>Both of her hands went immediately to his head, rubbing it as their lips met in a slow, romantic kiss. Tim leaned forward, and with his mouth opening to her, he eagerly kissed her, as a man would kiss a woman, kissing him back. His first kiss was long and languid, as if they were doing a slow ballet.</p> <p>A small part of Tim wondered what was behind her kiss, whether he was giving it a chance, or whether she was just making him want to be kissed. He didn't know at the time, but he found his cock reacting like a mad man. While she returned the kiss, she undid the strap of her gown, letting it drop to the floor. He saw her naked breasts for the first time, and they were beautiful, full and smooth. The nipples were large and hard on them, and her areola surrounded the pink nubs like little rubber pencils. He couldn't wait to make out with her.</p> <p>"Oh, god," he moaned. "Oh, god," he repeated over and over.</p> <p>He could feel her legs coming together. She was going to get off.</p> <p>The rest of their kiss seemed to last forever as Tim began to slowly, almost tentatively begin to caress at her thighs and hips. As the kiss ended, he looked over at his wife's skirt-covered body, and, seeing her hands moving to her own breasts, decided to have his way with her there.</p> <p>He slid forward onto the sofa, and she quickly straddled him, straddling him, then sitting on his lap facing him. His hands were running up and down her thighs, over her knees, and into the valley between her breasts, his fingertips reaching out for hers. He started rubbing her breasts through her clothes, feeling their softness and the hardness of her nipples beneath his hands. He could feel how damp her panties were through the thin fabric, and the dampness only made it obvious he and her were both excited.</p> <p>"Oooh, I wish I could take off those things, Tim," she said, moving her hips back and forth over his shaft. "You're so big."</p> <p>He moved his mouth to her neck, and with it came another wet kiss and moan, as he slid his right hand up under her gown and began to rub her bare skin there, while he felt her breasts with his other hand. Her hands began to move more urgently as she rubbed herself over him.</p> <p>"Ummmmm," she moaned. "Your tits are really getting me going. It feels so good. I love your fingersâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
