We'd really like to do some things we haven't done in over four years."</p> <p>"Well okay, but not too many things," I lied, thinking I knew what she was talking about, "Just a few things I guess," I added, "Like how much trouble you're in if there's no going back."</p> <p>Her eyes got round in that peculiar way that you get that first time when it sounds like an awful lot of noise. "Well okay, I guess I can get more or less anyway. I'm just afraid I never got used to all this, I guess I'll have to go back."</p> <p>That was a good thing because the next thing we know I'm back in the old house with four bedrooms and an empty bathroom. By the time I'm done and I'm ready to go home it's time for a shower.</p> <p>"I just wanted to make sure everything will be fresh and clean before we go home tonight," I told her, "I'll go down some time in the morning to do our laundry and then we can check up on how to get ready."</p> <p>"Oh I think I'll have a shower and then we'll see what we can do to make sure everything is ready. Do you want to come with me? I'll make sure everything is the way I feel I'm dressed."</p> <p>Just as our conversation ended I heard a shower start and my shower was already at its full capacity. I got another wash rag ready for the next shower and a box of hair remover. I was still a little worried but a lot of my apprehension disappeared as I got dressed and then the whole day seemed to move in a quick blur.</p> <p>It was almost two in the afternoon when she finally showed up. We'd been out shopping, shopping for a couple of weeks for a few things that were a new addition to a dress. I bought some skirts that I thought I'd be able to put a sexy, little black number on for tonight, something that would really get my imagination to work.</p> <p>My hair was combed down and in style and my blue eyes looked nice and smooth. I was wearing that dress that I'd bought the week before and it made me look like the sophisticated wife I was when I'd been in Paris. The skirt was so short that the top of my black stockinged thigh high stockings would make it look so short.</p> <p>"Hi honey," I greeted her as she walked through my door.</p> <p>"Oh, hey, what you doin' all this time?" She looked up and smiled at me. God how a woman could enjoy looking at her like that. I guess it was her look.</p> <p>"Well, I'm not wearing a bra," I told her.</p> <p>"Well I don't suppose you would."</p> <p>"Not at all," I said, "But of course I would if you didn't want me to."</p> <p>"Just let me grab my bag and I'll meet you in the bedroom."</p> <p>My mind was in such a whirlwind right then I don't think I would have said much more than: "Okay, go on up to your room and wait on me there."</p> <p>I was still standing at the door when she walked in.</p> <p>"Oh honey," she said, "I was just going to get a drink and watch some TV."</p> <p>"Oh, sure," I smiled, "I'll just finish what I'm doin'."</p> <p>"Okay," she replied cheerfully, "But let me grab my bag."</p> <p>I followed her and she led me out onto the patio so I could show her where to put my bag. The wine and my glass hadn't tasted so good so I was really nervous. I felt she was so sophisticated, but like the first night I'd really wanted to see her in this dress that way and I didn't want to ruin it.</p> <p>"This is a nice dress baby," she said, "I'm amazed you don't think it's too long and sexy."</p> <p>I really didn't want to ruin the mood, but I was in such a state. Her smile was radiant and I felt so stupid for leaving her home where she could see me like this. She took a sip of her wine and then smiled wider.</p> <p>"Thank you honey," she said, "This one is just as sexy as you thought it would be and I think you'll look great with it."</p> <p>"Thanks," I said as I leaned forward to take the glass from her hand. I'm always proud of my appearance but I've always been a little taller than I was when I was thirteen, which is a good thing right about now.</p> <p>"If I knewâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
