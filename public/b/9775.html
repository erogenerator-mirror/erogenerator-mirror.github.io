I tried to move in sympathy with my own suffering, and I wanted to be strong with my self, too.</p> <p>'Hey, come on, let's just go back to the office', I said. 'I'm starving'. 'We better get dinner started if we want to eat before we go to bed.' I thought he may turn and see me now, or even just be in shock, but he seemed to come out of nowhere. He said it at the same time, and I knew this would be the final test of my self-control. I looked away from him in shame.</p> <p>We ate in silence, my mouth full of something warm, but tasteless. He didn't say much, and I was relieved to know that he wasn't about to take advantage of me; and maybe he didn't think I'd want a lot of sex. But, I guess I just couldn't say what I really wanted. I was on the defensive now, and I knew I had to let him put the moves on me in the bed, not try to seduce him.</p> <p>A little later, he kissed me on the lips. Not a peck, but a very light, sweet peck. When I thought I was going to go crazy, he continued. He whispered in my ear, telling me that he'd never made love to a stranger before, and his first attempt at making love was, well, not very successfully. I must have blushed and stuttered a "No", because he shook his head. He looked at me and whispered, 'I'll take good care of you'. I looked at him and said, 'If you'll excuse me', and we both laughed. He came and knelt in front of me, and started to kiss me again. Slowly at first, but with more intensity. I just let him take me in his arms as his lips pressed on mine with more intensity.</p> <p>It took less than half an hour to finish dinner and wash up, as I had so many times in the past, and we walked to the car and drove to his friend's house. About half an hour before leaving, I said, 'So, what's it like to do this? It's not everyday you get out of a bad relationship and try and get the most out of it. You have to try to find your own pleasure', and then laughed as she laughed.</p> <p>I felt so guilty, too, and I never knew that being a girl would be so much fun. I don't have to hide anymore, I said to myself. It's time I gave the rest of the world a break, tooâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
