I promise."</p> <p>"Let's get to it."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>He led her back to his dormitory and she was feeling him up right away. He pushed her dress up about her waist and she wasn't wearing panties as soon as they entered the room.</p> <p>He pushed her back on the bed and started to undress her with his lips and tongue. She put her arms around his neck as he undressed her.</p> <p>They were both hard. He pushed on the top of her legs until they were spread apart and he pushed himself inside her, all the way to his balls. She couldn't believe how wet she was and her pussy lips felt like they were holding his cock inside.</p> <p>As soon as she started cumming he lifted himself off her and walked back to the bed where he lay down on his back. She had her legs bent backwards, spreading them apart and her hand was stroking her pussy.</p> <p>He climbed in beside her and she started to suck him as she played with herself. Once she got him hard, he rolled her over on to her back and she spread her legs, holding them apart. He moved in between them and thrust himself into her and thrust up into her, making her cum again within one stroke.</p> <p>She moaned as she came again with him. He fucked her hard and fast, his balls slapping her clit and as soon as she came, he came with her. She lay there as he pulled out of her and lay down beside her, both exhausted. He kissed her on her mouth and neck and finally rolled her over on her back.</p> <p>"No," she said. "I want to do the whole thing."</p> <p>"No," he said. "Now! After you cum, I know you want to do the other things. So, get up, stand up and come here"</p> <p>He walked over to her and stood there, looking down at her. He kissed her on the mouth before he started undressing. She was so excited that she didn't understand what was happening, but when she saw his hard cock and thought about it, she didn't care.</p> <p>He undressed himself and she followed him back to the bed.</p> <p>She got on top of him and started riding him, making him do the same. She kept telling him that if he didn't fuck her now, she was going to fuck him. He thought about that and told her to wait. He'd give her an orgasm if she wanted it. She wanted that. He wasn't sure how much longer he could hold out.</p> <p>"So how long will you be here"? he asked.</p> <p>"About six. Five minutes. We don't have to cum because my boyfriend is waiting. You'd better do it for me now or we'll be late."</p> <p>She said she'd be more than happy to do it.</p> <p>But he didn't wait and got on his knees and moved her onto her back. He pushed inside her and went back into her, again and again, feeling her insides squeezing him.</p> <p>He started to fuck her harder and she had two climaxes while he kept his lips tight around her neck. At one point, he held her hands tight and his teeth bit into her ear as she was cumming again. She fell asleep on top of him in a minute.</p> <p>The next morning, he was up immediately. He made coffee and brought some cookies outside. They sat and talked and talked for a little bit about their relationship. When they calmed down, he had to tell her that he didn't want to do things with her until she was ready.</p> <p>She wanted to do something with him, too. She said she would try things to his face. He seemed to have the answer. He asked her to do it and he asked her to make a video of it.</p> <p>"Why? Why me?" she asked.</p> <p>"You've always said not to have sex with me," he told her. "You don't want to do what I think you should. Now, let's try."</p> <p>He got a condom out of the drawer along with two of her disposable one's. He tore open one and took the condom, then got into position over her. She spread her legs as wide as she could to give him access to her. He put the condom on and then got into position again. She felt her boyfriend's cock and wondered if she'd still be there.</p> <p>But she'd gone a little crazy. She got off him and turned to watch.
