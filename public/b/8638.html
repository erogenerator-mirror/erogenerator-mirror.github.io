But how could I explain to Mom that I wasn't in love with her? Then why should I have been honest about my emotions? Who knows? This guy is soooo nice!</p> <p>And then the doorbell rang, I picked up my robe, let it fall onto the floor and rushed to answer. My mother's beautiful smile gave me my strength and I picked up my cell and answered the door. A handsome guy greeted me from within the living room. He was very tall with brown shoulder length hair and an incredibly handsome face. He seemed to be about my age and not exactly a typical college graduate. I guessed he was around the same age as Mom, at maybe a ten year age. I'm so damn proud of him, what's a guy to give a great name?</p> <p>I tried my best to make myself look presentable, not wanting to be rude. He seemed to be very friendly, so I walked in, thanked him for his time and introduced myself as my mother. He looked over to me and smiled, trying to be polite but looking my mother up and down. I couldn't help but to blush.</p> <p>Then he reached out and tenderly held the hem of my robe, pulled it over my head and placed it on the chair. I was embarrassed at his touch, so I pulled away and apologized to Mom.</p> <p>"That's okay honey. It's okay, that's what friends are for. Please forgive me for being too forward."</p> <p>I looked at him, and saw that he was very handsome. I knew he was really nice and I was really looking forward to having a chance to spend some quality time with my son. I thought I needed to say something.</p> <p>"Thank you very much for your kind words. I really enjoyed what happened with you. Mom can you walk me to the door?"</p> <p>He laughed. "Of course you can sweetheart. Come on."</p> <p>He was a little more than twenty pounds overweight and, I had always thought, a lot fitter than him. Mom was looking very sweet and sweet like she always was. I thought I was going to die! We both laughed, and we went to the front door. I got the door open and we started to go inside. Just before we got inside I said,</p> <p>"Mom, Dad, let's just sit down!"</p> <p>I think the look on my face showed that I didn't want to be interrupted by my father. He smiled and said, "Yeah, sure." He looked at me closely and I saw that he had a large bulge in his pants. I took his arm and we walked to the couch. He stood there like a statue, looking at me like I had the world to himself. I was a bit worried. He asked me for a second glass of water and I gave it to him.</p> <p>"What's wrong, Mom?"</p> <p>I could tell by his tone that he was worried about something. I knew he needed some time and I was thinking with the big head. I put my hands on his shoulders and asked if he needed anything.</p> <p>"That'll be really cool, Mom, thanks for this." He smiled at me and winked before smiling. He was so sweet, and if we were going to be a couple he wanted a lot of time.</p> <p>I really felt a sense of relief that I could be a more responsible adult for my boy friend. He had asked for it and it didn't have to be painful. What can I say? I'm a goody-goody.</p> <p>When we sat down I was thinking that he was feeling really awkward at the moment. I had never been this far into the lifestyle before and I'd never felt this way about anyone. I put my arm around him and squeezed a little.</p> <p>He asked,</p> <p>"I just really needed this to happen, Mom, and maybe it will."</p> <p>I looked at him, smiling. "I'll bet it will, handsome."</p> <p>He looked at me with that smile again. I just couldn't see past his kindness. That kind of feeling of compassion...I don't know. There was something about his smile that I didn't like. I wanted to get up and make sure that I didn't get kicked out of my room by something other than Dad. It made me feel guilty even though I knew what it happened to me. It was just that it took me far too long to be more compassionate with him.</p> <p>And then as if he really needed this...I thought it was time we went home. I didn't want a confrontation between our son and I. For a moment I thought maybe he'd just go to his room and call his parents. Not that we could do that.
