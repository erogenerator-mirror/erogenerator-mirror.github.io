Her eyes widened even more when she realized it was Jason making her strip the bed with his eyes. She had never been so turned on in her life and this was her only chance.</p> <p>"Don't get any ideas, babe," Jason said, watching her closely. He felt the flush of the blush on her cheeks as he realized he'd made her strip. He couldn't stand to see her nakedness again. His eyes roamed up her body with the anticipation of what was to come. He saw her hands as she reached down and deftly lifted her negligee off of her body. She was naked underneath.</p> <p>"Not even underwear?" she asked, her hands still stroking her soft skin. He nodded. He had been watching every move her fingers made, every thought he'd ever had for how to seduce her. He wanted to ask what turned her on. To feel in her aching body. To look at it in her eyes until he was close to her beautiful breasts, and maybe even touch it, just a little. He wanted to do that.</p> <p>"Please," she groaned and pulled him on top of her, pressing up against him as she wrapped her arms around his shoulders. She could feel the hardness of his cock against her stomach. "Don't," she said, pulling him down to kiss him and feel his body against her. Jason kissed her and felt her tongue slip into his mouth, and then inside his mouth with a gasp of pure pleasure.</p> <p>Molly gasped for air as his hand slowly made its way beneath her panties. She felt as hot as she was, and suddenly more comfortable as he pressed his fingertips into her lower stomach. Her eyes shut tight and she arched her entire body against him as he gently slid his hand over her clit. "That feels..."</p> <p>She could feel his fingers sliding over it, gently separating it. He could feel her wetness, warm and soft, and he looked up into her eyes with a grin.</p> <p>"Your pussy is so soft, mmm," he told her. His lips brushed hers and she closed her eyes back into him. "And it feels like it's waiting for me too, baby," he told her and began unzipping his pants.</p> <p>Molly groaned as she felt his fingers enter her, slipping in to rub against her as they made their way down to the front of her pussy and pushed against the opening to her body.</p> <p>"What are you doing? Oh my God..." she murmured as her body started to heat up. "Please..."</p> <p>"What is it?" he asked, grinning.</p> <p>"My body feels ready to explode, Jason..." she said. "I want your fingers inside me. I want your tongue and your cock, in there. I feel so... ready."</p> <p>Jason smiled. He had to admit it. He knew how close he was to touching her and he wanted to keep doing that for as long as he could. He'd given his mouth so much time and it was time for some good sex, not just some simple sex.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" he asked back. His fingers slipped down through her hair until they made contact with her clit and began rubbing around it gently. She felt like she was going to explode. He could feel her body tense up. He knew she wanted him to do this. Just a few seconds of fingering her, but right through her. She clenched her fists hard. Her heart beat faster. Her nipples pressed into the bed as she felt herself reach orgasm.</p> <p>"That feels good, baby," Jason said as she calmed down, and the tension eased out of her. He watched as a wave of pleasure spread through her as he brought her body down from her sexual peak. "Can we do it again?"</p> <p>"Sure - " Molly said, as Jason quickly turned to his pants. "Let me try that again, Jason. I know that's hard, but you can work with me." She grabbed the head of his cock, as if it were a small penis. "We won't be doing it all again, but maybe in a little while," she said, grinning a little.</p> <p>She reached down and grabbed the base of him and began stroking him while she slowly slid up and down on her knees, while his hard shaft. She looked up into his eyes as she pumped him. "Can you try that again, Jason? I've been dreaming of doing this every night for years." She kissed him as she worked his cock, licking the sides and top as she pumped up and down. "Is there anything else you really want me to do with my hand, Jason?"</p> <p>Jason looked down at her, surprised. "I want you to kiss me," she said. Her eyes seemed to light up.</p> <p>"Mmmâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
