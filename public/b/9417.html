This may sound strange, but you are the one she talked to. What is that?" He raised both eyebrows as he eyed the two women.</p> <p></p> <p>"Well, I can just tell you that when she was looking at the camera, she said that that girl was a lesbian. I think she was having a lesbian experience, too. I'm not sure, maybe. But I think the two of you should share that experience with her."</p> <p>Holly's head turned in the opposite direction.</p> <p>"Yeah. But she won't be lesbian, will she?"</p> <p>"I guess so. This way if she gets into it and doesn't like it, she will come back. I think in the event she does, she will never be a lesbian, although, she will definitely have been a lesbian for some time now."</p> <p>"Well, if it helps her, she will come back."</p> <p>"So, if you go back and she says she wants to, how should I go about it." Holly spoke up.</p> <p>"You just come, and maybe I'll help you enjoy the time of your life with her. Okay?"</p> <p>Holly nodded her assent in approval to his suggestion. When Holly said she'd go have a drink with her, she went upstairs with the man that she'd been thinking about all day. He looked at the guy's name that she thought was James, and smiled at the man. He was as handsome as the guy that had just blown Holly, but looked a different. He carried a few pounds above James', so the thought of that hot guy flirting with Holly would never have been an appealing thought. James and Holly had already been going steady for some time, but now that they were starting their relationship, he might be the most handsome guy that she'd ever had the opportunity to be with. When she started to feel it was just a matter of time before she was in love with him, she would have sex with this man.</p> <p>The man went back to James, and was a little surprised that the other man was there with them. He shook his head and said, "I don't really care how you two get along. And I have a feeling that we won't be seeing each else very often, until tonight. Right now, I just want sex with a man, so that when I come in tomorrow I can get some rest."</p> <p>James was just happy that he could take the chance that Holly had already given him the opportunity to get away from his girlfriend. They were both pretty drunk, so the idea to have a drink with James, and to go back upstairs and have a bit of fun with him, didn't really even bother him.</p> <p>Holly went downstairs with the man. She took the empty glass and handed it to him before he could reach her. She went to the refrigerator and leaned over to get a bottle opener. James stood up and watched her. She went back to the fridge and pulled out some ice on the side of two bottles. She got two glasses and placed them on the table.</p> <p>He walked over to the fridge and opened the door. The glasses were empty. James looked at Holly.</p> <p>Holly said, "Oh, come on. Let's go to the bed."</p> <p>He followed her upstairs. When they got to the bed, they went down to the bottom of the stairs, where they sat around the bed. The two women were on each side of the man. They embraced him with a passionate kiss. Holly kissed the man's neck, face, ears, and then began to unbutton his shirt. She removed the top button and then kissed the side of his chest while unbuckling his belt. Holly unhooked his pants and let them fall to the floor. Holly then moved her lips down to his belt, and helped him out of his underwear. She slid off his shorts and boxers along with his socks. She stood up, then undid her bra. James reached an arm out to her and helped her up. She stepped back to sit and then sat down with a look of bewilderment. James reached out to her and pulled her to him so that they could kiss again. For the first time in a long time, James got his hands and arms around the most attractive woman he'd ever had the pleasure of having on his bed. It had been the sexiest kiss. He wondered if he could ever get through being with Holly after they'd finished their night. It was then he got the idea to get her a drink. He went back upstairs and poured another glass of wine for himself and the women. Once back in the bedroom, he sat and crossed his ankles before him.</p> <p>"Well, what do you think?" asked Holly, leaning on her right arm. "He's going to have a good time tonight."</p> <p>"You know I think soâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
