He replied. He wasn't going to say anything else. The last thing he wanted to do was see her naked. He wanted his own wife. He was not the kind of man to get jealous, but he wasn't even certain that she would mind him feeling her naked.</p> <p>"I could use some company, too." she said, opening her dress shirt displaying her bra less breasts. She reached down and took out his soft cock and started stroking it through his shorts, "Mmm, I'm so horny right now, too." she said, reaching up and stroking him lightly. "I'm all yours," she said, pulling him by his cock to the bedroom, "but maybe next time we can do something else."</p> <p>"Hmm," he replied, thinking of her in her bra. "What makes you think that?"</p> <p>"I don't know," she replied, "I just need to touch you, that's all, and be touched by you," she winked at him.</p> <p>Jasper sat on the edge of the bed, he watched as her hands slowly slid under the waistband of her jeans and down to her pussy. He had never seen so much skin.</p> <p>"Ohhh," she purred, moving her hips to her own touch, "ohhh."</p> <p>"Jasper," she moaned, "I've wanted you so much," she looked into his eyes, "not so long this way," she pushed her jeans down over her knees to give him the better view, "but I've never done this to you before," she ran her fingers around the inside of her thighs to push them up and apart, "ohhh," she breathed quietly, and spread her legs while holding open her pussy for him to see. "Ohhh," she repeated before he could say anything, "I've never done this before," she sighed, "let me get the show on a slow, steady and slow."</p> <p>She slid off the bed and onto her hands and knees. She bent her face towards him and began to kiss him, pressing her lips against his in a passionate and open mouth, "Fuck me," she begged.</p> <p>He climbed out of his clothes, taking his shorts off. He had a big cock just like hers. He couldn't believe it. It stood out as hard as steel.</p> <p>She pushed up on her knees, opening the outer lips of her pussy with her fingers while he slid the cock in and out slowly by her hand. Her lips were like silk, opening and closing in rhythm with his cock, sucking on it slowly, "Mmmhhh," she whispered. She felt his body shiver when she touched his hard nipples. "Ohh," she closed her eyes and moaned, "ohh, ohhh, " she rocked on her knees as she felt his hard muscle slide in and out of her mouth.</p> <p>He started to cum too. He loved seeing his stiff dick pumping in and out of her mouth as she hungrily sucked and licked his cock. He came in her mouth, his cum running down her chin while she sucked on him.</p> <p>"Mmmph." she heard him moan as she stood up.</p> <p>"That was fucking awesome," she smiled.</p> <p>"I'm glad you called," he replied, "the more I have to ask her."</p> <p>Jasper sat up when the phone was back on her bedside table. "What do you have to say for yourself?" she asked, "that you would like her to be your wife?"</p> <p>"Yeah," he sighed, "I would prefer not to see her anymore."</p> <p>"Me too," she said, "but it's really the best thing that's happened. And I'm all yours anytimeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
