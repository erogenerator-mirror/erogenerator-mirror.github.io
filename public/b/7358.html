I wondered if she could see Lisa's face but I made no move to turn back. I wanted to be away from this, if I might be able to stand it.</p> <p>"Fuck!" she said louder, her voice getting louder.</p> <p>I heard what?</p> <p>A finger found my lips as her hand had found my cunt, rubbing and grabbing my labia and clitoris and I felt my head swimming. She kept her hand away from me, which was fine by me. Now was not the time.</p> <p>I had to stop it, but not just because I didn't want to. It was too late – and I wanted to do it. I pressed my thighs together as I heard a squeal from my sister-in-law.</p> <p>I let the panties slide off my feet as I stood up. My feet drenched with piss, I took hold of my panties and tried to pull them up, making sure not to spill any that I had in them.</p> <p>I knew full well I was still wet so they went into the floor. I stood there waiting for someone to walk in on me, probably the man who had fucked me in the bar. I couldn't see who it was until I heard him say something to my sister-in-law.</p> <p>"Lisa, what are you doing?"</p> <p>"I was doing it, but I'm going to come and sit down."</p> <p>He stepped in front of me, pulled my hand away from my vagina while his other hand held my pussy firmly. I heard him say something else, and the person walked in. He stood in front of me, his crotch at my eye level, and I felt his cock rub my lips, brushing them with his, almost pushing them apart so he could slide it between them.</p> <p>I was too high to tell if he was as big as his man. We had joked about him at a movie and I would get his cock in my mouth at all hours.</p> <p>"Lisa, what are you doing?" he said, sounding surprised but also somewhat disappointed. "I heard you fucking this young lady up there."</p> <p>"I'm going to sit down. I'm sorry if I did!"</p> <p>His mouth was only inches from my pussy, the tip of his tongue brushed against the inside of my lips and he stopped and took in some deep breaths.</p> <p>"That's okay, it's not your fault at all."</p> <p>He looked directly up at me, a smile playing on his lips.</p> <p>"Is this okay?" he asked, his cock already semi-hardening. "It's not very important, just do this." I told my sister-in-law.</p> <p>He stepped back, still naked, and sat in the seat. I stepped over and sat down.</p> <p>"It's okay. We can talk about it later." I said to him.</p> <p>I pulled my panties on quickly as he got dressed and I looked at him. He said nothing.</p> <p>I turned away from him and waited.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said anything about it." He told me again.</p> <p>"It's okay." I said to him. "Look, just... I hope it doesn't destroy our friendship, you know that."</p> <p>He shook his head.</p> <p>"No... we've got some things to be careful about, and I'll do whatever I can to get it back." He said, sounding as if he was asking me to tell him where to go if it meant he'd be a better man.</p> <p>I thought to myself that I hoped I could keep him. To do that the old fashioned way.</p> <p>"I know you won't." I said. "When you were a little boy at your mother and father's was his whole world. If he didn't do what I did."</p> <p>He smiled at me. I could tell he was pleased with me.</p> <p>"No... I really don't think it would hurt our friendship." He said. "I know what you want, but like I said, I'm just not a good man."</p> <p>"Look, if you ever want to... well, you know that I'll always be here for you." I said before I even finished the sentence.</p> <p>He looked at me, looked me up and down.</p> <p>"I'd have to make myself scarce." He said.</p> <p>"No... you could come with me if like that. I'll go anyway."</p> <p>I was thinking about it, thinking of being at—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
