She closed her eyes and held him. "I just . . . ."</p> <p>"I know. And it's okay. I'm glad you came over. That you could."</p> <p>"That's a whole different story though. I'm just glad that you're happy." She lifted his face toward hers.</p> <p>He put his arms around her waist and kissed her. This time, there was no hesitation. Their lips molded as his tongue probed, and their breathing became more intense. Their tongues wrestled inside each other's mouths. It became obvious for both of them that nothing was beyond their love for one another.</p> <p>"Mmmm." She cooed in his ear as she continued to kiss him.</p> <p>After a minute or so of intense kissing, she lifted her face and smiled.</p> <p>"Come to the bedroom, Baby."</p> <p>He pulled her close to him and kissed her deeply. When the kiss broke, he wrapped his arms around her waist and pressed his erection against her thigh as he bent his head to kiss her chest again. He heard her give a small sigh. "Mmm. That was a long time coming."</p> <p>"I'm glad for that and we have to do that more often."</p> <p>"We'll have to take advantage of that. It's not like I'm in the mood just yet." She lifted her legs, pulling them over his waist. "Come inside."</p> <p>They went to his bedroom, the large room with several posters of Playboy and Penthouse. There was a large queen-size bed and a couch in the center of it, and a dresser in the corner.</p> <p>"Let's make the bed," he said. "And get ourselves comfortable."</p> <p>"I can't think of anything else yet." She was pleased with himself. "I think you need this. Your cock is wonderful!"</p> <p>"Good. Then we can take advantage of the mattress if you think there's anything else you'd rather share."</p> <p>She giggled and went back to kissing him. "I think you have lots to see." She held his face in her hands and pressed her lips to him again. He took the initiative and lifted her onto the bed, laying her on her back.</p> <p>"Kiss my breasts, Lover." He knelt on the floor by the bed where she watched his every move. "Kiss my pussy, Baby."</p> <p>He kissed her lips. "Are you sure you want to go there?"</p> <p>"I'm sure. And it's only fair that we all get all to ourselves."</p> <p>He looked at her as he kissed his way down to her breast. He was kissing her bellybutton when she asked, "What're you waiting for?"</p> <p>"I want your pussy right before my mouth." He lifted her thighs and put them over his shoulders.</p> <p>"Let's do that now," she said. "I love you."</p> <p>With his cock in her, he moved inside of her.</p> <p>"Are you sure you don't want this?"</p> <p>"Mmm-hmm. Of course I do. You have the most exquisite pussy, Baby. I'd love to taste it."</p> <p>"That's very tempting."</p> <p>He pushed his head deeper inside of her. It felt amazing having his body inside hers, not wanting him to leave. He was able to move so deeply with her that he almost lost his balance.</p> <p>"You feel good."</p> <p>"I'm glad that you do. It's always nice."</p> <p>She rolled over and pulled her legs up over his shoulders. "That's good. I like that."</p> <p>He thrust in and out of her with long, slow strokes. He had to adjust his position a little. Her hips were in the right position, and they could work together.</p> <p>"I love your breasts," he said. "Do you like it when I kiss them?"</p> <p>"Mmm. It's okay if you call it that."</p> <p>"I love the way you kiss them. I'd like to kiss them a lot."</p> <p>"Maybe we can take a break first."</p> <p>"Okay. But don't stop."</p> <p>"Of course."</p> <p>The bed moved as she lay back with her legs wrapped around his waist. He continued thrusting deeper and deeper. His body was ready to explode. He wanted to come deep inside of her with each stroke.</p> <p>"Ahhhhhhhhhh. Baby. My cock feels so good insideâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
