He took me in his arms and kissed me softly, not the hard open-mouthed lust of the first kiss but the soft and probing kisses he gave me that first afternoon just a week or so before. It was all I needed to be completely honest with myself.</p> <p>My body knew how to respond to his kisses and as our lips touched I felt my nipples hardening. His hand slid down my torso until it found it's way into the elastic on my panties. I could feel he could feel my arousal, but it wasn't his hand that I felt excited, it was his eyes that opened to stare inside. I wanted him so badly but he didn't stop kissing, but as soon as his hand found its way to my crotch I knew that my legs were going to give a hard jerk and they were going to start tearing.</p> <p>I moaned as his hand started rubbing my swollen labia through the cotton and his lips brushed mine once again. It wasn't my desire to have him touch me there that aroused me, I needed him to. I ran my fingers through his hair and into his damp hair when he moved away to get a better look into his eyes. He was as shocked and as turned on as I had expected him to be.</p> <p>As he turned back around I felt my head spinning and it had a moment's reprieve when he wrapped me in his strong arms and started kissing me again. When I could stand it no longer, I leaned my head back and I moaned into his kiss and he responded by sucking my neck softly and then moving my head back again. I moaned again as I felt his hands slide under my shirt and up my stomach to caress the sides of my breasts. I wanted to feel them, wanted to feel his naked hands on them but that felt too good to ask.</p> <p>I moaned as he slipped my shirt off exposing my breast and I felt him begin to kiss them before moving his hands to my hips to remove my jeans and panties. Once they were off I took turns running my fingers over his face. He leaned towards my neck and I felt my body beginning to throb as his hands slid under my butt and slowly moved my legs apart. I let my heels drop to the bed with a gasp and I heard him chuckle before his lips met my pussy again.</p> <p>"Yes," I groaned as his mouth found a sweet spot on my body that I hadn't had touched in a long time. "Oh, yes," I croaked as I felt a finger press against the opening to my pussy. "Please, no." I was shocked when his mouth left one spot, and it felt more wonderful than I could have imagined it could. He rubbed it against my sensitive opening and just as I thought that it was going to send me out of my mind... it didn't. When he moved his finger in and out I didn't want him to stop. Just when I thought I had the will to stop him, his mouth left me and I gasped.</p> <p>After just a few seconds he took his hand out of the way and moved the thin blanket to the ground again. He bent down and took my hands in his and pressed my palms against his back, his fingers slowly moving up to my neck, and then down the front across my breasts. I don't know how much more I could stand. "I, uh," I managed to utter before both hands fell away from me and he lowered his lips to mine. His hands were so soft, and as my body jerked at the contact, I felt as though I could cum in just one move. I kissed him back with the same intensity because that's what it felt like. He kissed me softly and slowly made his way down my body, which made my hands rub against both his and mine.</p> <p>"Oh," I managed after our bodies had cooled enough. He moved on top of me slowly and kissed his way down my body, finally coming to rest on mine. My heart was racing and I was nervous that when he moved back up we might be kissing again, but at the last second I let him lift me up so I could wrap him around his waist. I wanted our kiss, needed it again. I held him close and he held me as we looked into each other's eyes.</p> <p>"We can't," I told him. "We don't have to." But I didn't have to say that. He seemed to know what I was thinking.</p> <p>"But we could," he countered. "And we could." I was hoping he wasn't going to say something that would shock me.</p> <p>"We can?" I asked but his look told me I couldn't.</p> <p>"Yes. And we could say that we don't want to." My heart was racing and I wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
