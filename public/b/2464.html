We’ve been having a blast and we really want the new house.”</p> <p>“Oh you don’t know the half of it. Come see the new pool. The girls are going to be out for a little while, and I want you to come over and stay and help me, and help me with the cooking too. That’ll be so easy, after we put the place in the garage we can make it look like it’s from the house.”</p> <p>That’s all I could say, just the way you say and do it. I just knew we could do it.”</p> <p>“If a man can do it, why can’t a woman,” was my reply.</p> <p>“And you can do it too,” she continued to say. "I can just tell your husband to let you do it,” she added with a smirk. “Come on over, lets get a drink and take a shower. I’ll change."</p> <p>I looked outside again to see what was going on. I couldn't see the yard because there was a house on either side of the garage, so we had to be up a ways to the pool. She pulled up the driveway and I saw that there was a gate through the gate and we were on our way. I tried to pull my bathing suit down over my cock as soon as we got in the front of the house.</p> <p>We were all naked in the house by the pool and a tall man was working on the grill. I heard the shower turn off in the bathroom, so I sat down on the side of the pool and watched him go through the house. I saw my wife come out of the bathroom with a white towel wrapped around her towelling, she was still naked as they walked down stairs and into the kitchen. She joined me on deck and went upstairs. I heard them in the back bedroom. I felt more than heard the water run as I sat there listening to the rhythmic sounds of the shower going or whatever they were doing. This was so embarrassing. I just couldn’t help myself. I knew what I wanted.</p> <p>I heard her come back downstairs, followed by the man in the bathroom. I heard them in a more or less relaxed mood. I looked over to see if I could get a good view, but I couldn’t see her. The man on the other side of the house was watching her while he washed himself. What am I looking at, I thought? Just the woman I’ve fallen in love with, and here she is naked in a bathroom with her husband and friend watching the fucking show my wife was putting on for them.</p> <p>I was watching everything. My penis was getting hard at the sight of the other people in the house. What was it going to be like watching my wife making love to her man in the shower? How would it be different watching the woman making love to her husband next? I turned to look out of the window.</p> <p>I guess one of the things that we wanted was for other people to watch. I was feeling so helpless watching my own wife taking a man and having him do whatever he wanted. There was nothing wrong with that. The sight was so erotic, I felt sorry for her with the other people there. When she saw the man's cock in her hand that she got up and ran out to join him, she must have wondered what to do. The guy’s cock had got hard and I could see the pre-cum seeping from the eye in the side of the knob.</p> <p>The man was watching her do exactly what she was doing to herself. I watched with a growing passion. I wanted to do this again. Was watching her do that turning her on for someone like me? Would I be willing to do the same to her and to another woman in such a way too? I turned and walked off toward the steps on each side of the pool. I saw him walk down stairs, then down to the deck where my wife was still washing off the soap.</p> <p>I walked down and walked to him. As I reached the steps to the deck I felt a hand wrap itself around my penis. It felt so good. There were no secrets between men or women when it came to doing this kind of thing. It felt so right to be enjoying such an adventure. It was just so good to know there were people in the front of the house doing all these things to a beautiful woman. I watched as the man in the water’s waist was getting close too. He was getting ready to cum as my wife’s eyes caught him in the same—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
