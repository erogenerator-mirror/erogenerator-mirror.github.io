"That's the trouble of being young... you don't know who the lucky bastard got, no matter how many of your friends ask you," he told her.</p> <p>"I suppose... there's something to be said about the fact that you still love me," she quipped. They sat in silence before she spoke again.</p> <p>"Well... if the chances of me becoming your roommate are good enough... so am I," she finally stated.</p> <p>"If I was your roommate," he questioned her quietly, "if you were my girlfriend... wouldn't that be a bit..." he trailed off, "an affront?" he grinned.</p> <p>"No..." she smiled.</p> <p>He took a sip of the bourbon. "So, you'd think it would be a bit much after..." he shrugged.</p> <p>"...I'm assuming I could convince everyone of the fact I'm gay... if I told everyone, I think I could find a group of my friends."</p> <p>"Well," she replied slowly. "If you hadn't been my boyfriend, I would have... you know... been with you," she grinned. He laughed out the top of his glass and downed the remainder of the bourbon. "But, I can't..."</p> <p>He smiled. "Then let's get back to your apartment and start over."</p> <p>She looked back at him with a half grin on her face and started for the door. "You got it, cowboy," he grabbed her and hugged her.</p> <p>"Uh, yes, I did," he replied.</p> <p>"Yes, I will. You'll see." She grabbed the back of his head and kissed him. "Just don't put me in a lot of the position that you're at, honey," he whispered in her ear. He felt her hand slide down his body before settling against his cock. "Oh, God," she said and kissed him deeply again. "I've been such a little slut before... you just look so nice..."</p> <p>"You'll get used to it, lover," he assured her. He watched her as she made her way towards the door. "I'm still in this afterglow," he smiled.</p> <p>"I know," she smirked as she kissed her way down his body. He pulled her to him. "So, would either of you object to a drink?"</p> <p>"Of course," he said and stood up to leave.</p> <p>"But, we can't," she countered.</p> <p>"Yeah, but that's what you're for," he responded. "Besides... you already know how much I love doing to you. And I've always appreciated it when you were young..." he took a sip of the bourbon, "and I love it when you're young. And, I do all right."</p> <p>She took another sip, then opened her mouth to say something but couldn't come up with anything that would give her away. She sat back down and took another sip. She closed her eyes and sighed, "That drink might have been the best in my life!"</p> <p>"I never give a shit," he said and leaned over and kissed her again. "And, I don't think that's a good thing," he laughed and then kissed her deeply and passionately. They kissed for quite some time before she broke away and gave him a playful swat on the shoulder. "Hey, I think my friend's getting a big kick out of the three of us getting a threesome!"</p> <p>She looked back at the bar and saw her own friend holding in her hands a tray of drinks. She took one of the drinks and sat on a stool. "You look good!" she smiled. Just seeing him there for once, it had been an instant. A huge part of her had wanted to be in the limelight for a while. But, the fact that she was going to be seen by others for a while hadn't seemed like such a big deal. She decided she wanted to be the center of attention. A quick glance around the room revealed that she hadn't been the only one in the room when she looked up. Mike.</p> <p>Mike had been watching her the last couple hours. He found out that she wasn't wearing any clothes under her dress. Her dress was hiked up, revealing her breasts to both men and women. She caught Mike looking as she did this. She didn't think it would be too bad, he already knew that she was a dirty slut. In fact, she was pretty damn convincing. And, a little bit smug that she was the one in the room, he found that incredibly exciting.</p> <p>"You're such a slut!" Mike laughed and watched her. She knew he saw her.</p> <p>"I'm not too sure how you got yourâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
