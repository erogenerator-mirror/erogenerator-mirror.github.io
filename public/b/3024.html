Your first instruction is to stay still until I am satisfied." I did as she instructed without protest or objection but I was aware that my cock had no real choice. I felt her lips surround my shaft, she began to rub her lips against the underside while it was buried in her mouth, and then I felt the soft warmth of what could be termed 'a 'tongue.' I could here, a slight slurping sound, followed by the wet sucking of her lips. At first I was unable to determine whether this had happened in its original manner. I just knew that, while in this fashion, it did have its benefits.</p> <p>The vibrations were coming from the back of Sarah's throat so I did not care. In fact, I wondered if she could feel these vibrations. Perhaps because she had the capacity to perform this type of oral sex, she certainly felt them, although my knowledge had been limited when I had experienced it. I soon found out that this activity could be an erotic phenomenon in one of the most intense sexual positions. I felt her hand moving, not from the back of my cockhead, rather, from where it disappeared into her mouth.</p> <p>"That's nice," continued Jessica, "you are enjoying this." She was smiling as she continued to lick my shaft, now wet with her spit, and I began to wonder whether she meant it. I guessed that she meant by her actions to be sexual and in fact I felt that she meant it, just as I was thinking about a woman pleasing me, if not for her actions. I had no idea if she wanted me to come in her mouth, which might be very difficult.</p> <p>Jessica's lips stopped their journey so there was no need for her to do this, however, in an instant I could feel my cock stiffening and I knew what was about to happen. As much as I wanted to keep this from happening, I also wanted to enjoy it, at least to the extent possible. I felt Jessica's tongue touch me again, this time a little firmer and to the point, I wondered if it would hurt. I was thinking that Jessica knew what she was doing, that she was using her mouth to pleasure me, and I found myself feeling a rush of pleasure as she took me into her mouth. I didn't know whether I would stop the sensation at that level but at some level Jessica seemed to understand.</p> <p>As Jessica stopped her activities she began to increase her speed, which was driving me on into ecstasy. "You are doing very nicely, Ms Matthews," she said, "just what I expected. You certainly seemed to enjoy us licking your cock." I nodded and realized that she could not believe my words. I felt like such a slut but I couldn't wait to know if anyone told at the next workshop. I felt Jessica's body shift as she removed her mouth, then another movement and she was kneeling before me. I could now see she was stroking her own breasts too and perhaps she realised what was happening, she stopped. This meant that she was not stroking my cock; she was stroking my face... and it seemed natural and acceptable to her. My cock became erect again, and as more blood began to flow it was obvious that it wouldn't be long until this was achieved.</p> <p>"Do you like our treatment?" I heard Jessica ask. I guessed correctly. "Your pussy and mouth are really on offer, Ms Matthews," a voice I could not discern. As I heard that a certain thrill passed through me and the same in her. I was still hard but Jessica seemed oblivious, I wondered how she could enjoy it, after all it was our last workshop.</p> <p>"This is called oral sex," said Jessica, "if you must know it's called an 'oral massage,'" she corrected me, "a man's cock slides along his tongue but can only feel the lips," she said indicating my cock in this analogy. "There is one particular variation and you'll have to find it a little difficult to remember."</p> <p>"Your lips are a lot more sensitive," I observed through the drowsiness of my mind. "If you spread your legs just a bit wider will you be able to touch yourself. It's not going to hurt is it, is it, and, I suppose, even in this state?" My head was swimming and I tried to stammer out some answers but no words came out. I felt Jessica's lips move and felt something moist on my cockhead. "It is rather exciting to you to touch yourself," the voice said, "but your nipples are still very sensitive." I heard my mind say "it's not really a cock, it's a mouth," but the words seemed so natural and normal to Jessica and me, as ifâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
