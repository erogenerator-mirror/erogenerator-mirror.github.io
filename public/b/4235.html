I didn't like that she would think of me.</p> <p>"It's a baby," I whispered.</p> <p>"A what? You don't think it's right?"</p> <p>I shrugged. It wasn't right that I was pregnant. And it wasn't right that I should have known.</p> <p>"Just...like...I don't know," I stammered.</p> <p>She stopped walking and stood as close to me as she could.</p> <p>"Don't you worry, I wouldn't ask," she said.</p> <p>"But, you shouldn't have done that to me, you know," I whined again.</p> <p>"Yes I do. I mean, I love you so much," she said. "But we can stop now if you insist."</p> <p>I smiled, "That's right, I do insist," I said as I put both of my hands up against her breasts.</p> <p>"No," I shook her like I was shaking a puppy. "Please don't. You're beautiful, and I'm not into girls. I shouldn't have been so...I shouldn't have...it's wrong and I don't want to stop. You make me feel right."</p> <p>She kissed me again, but this time her tongue slipped into my mouth. She was going to do something about my erection.</p> <p>"Oh," I kissed her again, "I guess you're right."</p> <p>I felt her tongue slide between my lips. I didn't want to but I had no choice. She was in control, and by then I would give in to her every desire. For a moment I thought I would get it, but then my erection started to become painfully trapped inside my boxers.</p> <p>I broke the kiss when it became too intense and started to run out of room and we both stood in front of the mirror fixing each other's hair.</p> <p>"Why were you so quiet?" she asked. "Do you have any plans today?"</p> <p>"I...I um...I um..." That last part came out like a croak, and she grabbed my hand and dragged me over to a bench that had been pulled down from the far end of the cabin. "Are you ready to show me a new day?"</p> <p>I nodded and we picked our clothes off the floor.</p> <p>Then she started to unzip me. I wasn't sure what was going on but I didn't object, just kept my eyes closed until I felt her fingers wrap around my aching erection, then tug my boxers down to help me.</p> <p>"I had a feeling you weren't going to show me anything. But you're in for a surprise," she said as she pushed my shoulders down and I leaned back against the cool bench as she knelt down in front of me, still stroking my erection. "And I like a man that appreciates a woman doing things that she was never going to do. Don't you?"</p> <p>I nodded as she started to kiss my stomach and chest. Soon she had me turned on my back and pulled her clothes off too.</p> <p>Then she sat down on my lap facing me, and started to stroke me again. She leaned back against the bench and slowly started to lift and stroke my erection. She did it slowly, but she was obviously enjoying myself because her hips moved with little humping motions. My erection was in heaven inside her warm wet mouth.</p> <p>"I'm not going to last long," I warned her.</p> <p>She didn't back off though, and continued to move up and down, slowly at first, and then faster and faster until finally she grabbed my erection and jerked it furiously with her hand.</p> <p>"Oh! Oh! Oh!" she grunted as another orgasm hit her.</p> <p>I don't think I had ever seen her look like she was cumming that fast. When she finally relaxed and looked at me, she giggled and leaned back against me. I felt a warm feeling on my arm and leaned over to kiss her. Her hands slid in under my T-shirt to hold my breast as much as hers did my erection.</p> <p>"Did you want to see this too?" she asked me.</p> <p>"More than anything in the world," I answered as I felt both of her hands on me again. I felt her hand press firmly against my erection.</p> <p>"That's not fair, I didn't know it should be your turn," she said. "I guess I better give it a rest."</p> <p>"It may be time, but I'll come back soon," I said as I stroked her nipples. And then I felt the rush of warmth between my legs again.</p> <p>"Do you ever get enoughâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
