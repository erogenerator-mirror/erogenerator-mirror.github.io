It was becoming more than just a matter of reflex. My own pleasure, as well as the need to touch it, was taking over my being. I kept masturbating away. I was close. I was close. The pleasure grew. The pleasure grew. And I kept coming. Each time, the waves would grow stronger. Each time, the waves would return. And each time I came, I felt like my whole body was in a vice; each wave was stronger.</p> <p>I kept cumming and cumming, never letting go of my pleasure, until I was just a pool of hot pleasure. I couldn't stop! I never stopped. I never was going any part of it, I just kept coming.</p> <p>After what seemed like minutes, but was really only a couple of seconds, I was finally able to regain control of my own body. I started pumping my own climax into my hands. It felt so good to feel those pulses of cum in my hands. It felt so good I could feel it dripping off my fingers, the sensation was heavenly. I still had a grip on my dick, but the last drops of come were on my fist. That was the most intense orgasm I had experienced the previous night. I could feel it building up. It was almost too much.</p> <p>"Oh... fuck.... yes... yes... YES!" I yelled as my body spasmed. I tried to lift myself to lie down, instead, I felt like I couldn't take much more. I managed to roll onto my left side. My dick was still in my hand, and I moved my hand down and back. It started to relax, and I put the tip back into my mouth, cleaning the last drops of come off my fist.</p> <p>After recovering a bit, I felt that I had enough energy to go grab a towel and clean myself up. Still on my stomach, still weak after my orgasm, I stood up to walk towards the kitchen. I heard the front door open. I looked up. There was a figure leaning over the kitchen counter. It was the same guy I had seen walking in, but he came over.</p> <p>"Yeah... yeah I got some," was all I could muster.</p> <p>"Good... I think it will be nice to have a quickie," he said with a smile of satisfaction.</p> <p>"Yeah, see you in a few... yeah... I guess," I replied in a halfhearted way. I was still too weak to stand, so he had enough room to walk over to the fridge.</p> <p>He sat in the chair opposite me. My dick still lying against my stomach, I picked it up and put it to my pussy. This time he didn't hold it while he cleaned up. He took some of the towel, and started to clean out my dick before it started to get soft. I let my dick fall to the ground as I sat there.</p> <p>"Is there any more? Can I see it again?"</p> <p>"No... but... just because it's nice doesn't mean you can't look. Sorry. I have to go..." I said, walking out of the kitchen, feeling somewhat sorry. What to do now? I thought. I thought about the last day, how I was so tired at least. I thought about what I had done today... and all I could think of was I would love to feel that dick again. The feeling was starting to fill me, and I felt it start to run down my leg, I tried to grab it with the other one, and I felt like... like... I wanted to feel it again. But I couldn't.</p> <p>I was thinking of what to do, when the door opened again. The same guy walked in. He looked like he walked in a party, he was completely naked. He was tall, with a small frame, but definitely had a lot. He was also looking me up and down, which was not the look in the pictures I had taken the previous day. His eyes kept looking at me, so I could see that he was looking for something I could see clearly.</p> <p>"Holly... what is the matter? Are you ready to go again?" He said in a soft tone.</p> <p>"Huh? Yeah, sure." I walked over to him, feeling weak. He moved around on his knees, in between my legs. I immediately opened myself to him. Now what was I supposed to do, I wondered.</p> <p>"I'm not leaving you like this," he said, looking into my eyes. I felt the wetness between my legs just to notice it, and started to rub my own dick.</p> <p>"I don't know..." I started to say. He stopped his motion. "Yeah, I guess," I said. It felt natural. It felt good. I felt him smileâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
