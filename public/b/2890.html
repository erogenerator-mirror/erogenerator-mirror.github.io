He hung up the phone and said, "Well I better get going. I don't have much time. You want to make up a bed for the night? We can do that," He handed the phone to me and when I got closer he looked deep in my eyes and said, "I see that you still have the hots for me. You just don't know how to take it from there."</p> <p>He walked out of the room and I felt it, a warm, wonderful tingling in my pussy. So was this day. But then it was over. That's when I started to have thoughts. I mean, I am not gay, I only like guys but do everything with them, especially if they are good looking. And what if the guys were good looking? I mean, he's so hot, I bet he can come in his own pants. I guess that's going to be fine with me.</p> <p>I turned around to give him a kiss before he left and when he did I couldn't resist him. But we had to hurry or we would burst. After he closed the door, I went to my nightstand and grabbed his things off the nightstand. I pulled him down to the edge of the bed and we kissed passionately. When I got down to his underwear, we kissed for quite a while. I could tell that he was really into it and wanted me to go all the way. At first it seemed that way then he moved his hands in between our bodies. I wasn't sure when he was going to make up for this little act and began to kiss his chest then up to his neck. He was looking up at me while I kissed up to his ear and said, "I've been dreaming about fucking you for so long baby. I can smell the booze on you now. It was a fantasy of mine."</p> <p>I think it was what I was thinking. I kissed his stomach and got down to his cock while I stroked his cock. I wanted to feel it and to kiss and suck on it and make it feel good. As I did that he told me, "Oh baby, your mouth is so good. I'm not the only guy that wants that. I think it's about time I fucked you."</p> <p>I wanted him so bad. I wanted to be fucked by him. I wanted him to fuck me and I wanted to kiss him and feel his cum on me. I wanted to know what sex was like. I wanted to be with him and I wanted him to do it too. I wanted him to feel good and he was going to do that to me too.</p> <p>As I started to stroke my lips up and down his length I could hear him moan and when I got back to the head I kissed it, kissed it a little up and down and then began to suck on it. I couldn't believe how good it felt. What was I doing that I was about to do?</p> <p>He was pushing his hips up against my mouth. I wanted to feel him in my throat. So I got down on my knees and looked up to see him looking down at me. He was moaning and he was taking everything he could get.</p> <p>At that moment I knew everything about him. It was what I really wanted. I took my mouth, as deep as I could, started sucking on it, I used my tongue to play with his cock under the head, and I knew that he could feel what I was doing. He had his hands on my head but I felt that he wouldn't let me move. I loved the feel of his fingers in my hair. I could taste cum on his cock and it made me wet. He had another big load in there and I wanted to feel it.</p> <p>I took him back inside my mouth and he began moving his hips at a fast pace again. When he moved so his cock was back up against my throat some cock was going into me and a cock was going into my pussy. I looked up to see him moving his head back and forth a little and he was moving his cock up against my throat. He put his hands on my shoulders and moved my head up and down and he held me there a little while. He was moaning and I could feel his cock pushing against the back of my throat. I could feel him about to cum. I was going to swallow it. He stopped moving my head down and began to kiss me. "So what do you want me to do to you? Tell me what you want. I've wanted to do that all day now. What was that all you've wanted?"</p> <p>"Bitch, I want you to suck my cock. I want to see you in your little panties. I want to lick you and kiss you all over. I want to hear you cry. I want my cock in your mouth.
