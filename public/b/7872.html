What are you doing?" I gasped as she leaned down to kiss me with an open mouth.</p> <p>"You like that, don't you?" she whispered between kisses.</p> <p>"Yes." It was a groan of need in my chest at her words.</p> <p>"Let me help you," she said and she leaned down, nuzzled my neck, her fingers reaching down to play at my growing cock against her, and slowly worked it from her cleavage as her tongue went straight for my lips.</p> <p>When our mouths finally broke, almost too soon, she pulled back, and kissed me full on the lips, her tongue moving to tease my own as my tongue met hers.</p> <p>It was so wonderful, I could have just kept my lips off her, it's impossible to feel like a woman, not like an equal if not equal. She must've also felt the same. She leaned back on her heel for me to get up, and we lay together in bed, face to face, arms around each other, enjoying the closeness. For long moments we just lay there, enjoying the sensation, looking at each other.</p> <p>I thought about what had happened, and wondered if I was really that special to her. I also wondered what it would be like to have a relationship with a woman who I would like to make love to even if we weren't together, and what would we look like when the circumstances conspired. Was I actually lucky? Was I lucky that I finally fell in love with such a wonderful woman? How could we ever truly be happy with each other? To be honest, I didn't know if my feelings for her were real, but I still felt like we were, or were some kind of fantasy from beforeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
