I smiled at her, my eyes lingering on her pretty face. Her face, the beauty of it, I thought, it took my breath away, and seeing it there for the first time made me ache inside. Then, as if the moment had come, it was gone in a flash, and I closed the door.</p> <p>In the car I sat there for what felt like forever, and every time that I sat down or moved a muscle, I found my eyes looking at her, and at the way her hair was still dark, and her lips, soft and red, were swollen and a little moist. I thought she was beautiful, and I knew I hadn't felt this happy in a long time. Then, almost immediately after opening the door, I felt her lips on mine, a light kiss, which is exactly what I remember.</p> <p>After a long kiss, she raised the car and started away, leaving me to look at her face a little more, trying to read her features, just from the look on her face. Then, as she walked away from me, she took hold of the top of my jeans and pressed them, just below my knee. Her hand came out of the darkness and pulled down the front of them and my fly, exposing my cock which quickly sprang up to attention.</p> <p>Her hands went higher, and she took hold of my cock between her fingers. I felt her warm palms on my cock and in her hands, but it was just as I imagined, an electric feeling of excitement, and her hands seemed to be moving on their own. Slowly she stroked my cock up and down until the head of my cock was lightly resting against the bottom of her hand. Her hand was moving over the top of my shaft as well, and I couldn't hold my excitement any longer. I closed my eyes and moaned, feeling it's pulsing of blood in my cock and my balls with each stroke, feeling the tightness of my balls and feeling the way the blood was flowing all the way to the base and into the base of my cock which was almost touching the steering wheel.</p> <p>It felt wonderful, but it was more than that, the excitement of it all, a kind of arousal that I had never felt before - I felt like an extension of that feeling to you, a sensation of a sort. I didn't know if I could say all I wanted to in front of her, but I could do that.</p> <p>I closed my eyes again and tried to see what she was doing, but couldn't. She seemed to know what to do, what she was feeling, and she just kept right on stroking my cock and stroked her hand up and down my length. At that point, I could feel that the excitement was building up and that feeling of pleasure was building up. My hips started to be pushed forward slightly from a more obvious rhythm.</p> <p>I felt her head close to mine and her lips touch my lips with a soft kiss. She brought her hand up and gently touched it against the side of my face and her fingers touched against her lips, and her lips touched my lips again, then she repeated her kiss, and at the same time she parted her lips and let my tongue touch hers. At that point, her hand was stroking and squeezing my cock, and when she pressed her lips against mine, I could feel and understand what she was doing, and I felt it too.</p> <p>Our kiss started out soft and caring, with her lips brushing mine softly, her tongue caressing mine, and her breath and breath coming in gasping gasps, as her hand squeezed my cock, and all at once I felt like I was at the height of my orgasm, in a sea of ecstasy, and I was cumming, hard, over and over. I remember it almost looked like I was cumming in my pants, as it was hard, and deep in my groin, but all at the same time.</p> <p>She didn't remove her hand from me. I could feel a gentle squeeze of my cock, as well as feel my own warm penis throbbing and twitching in time with my heart, and feel like I was holding my own orgasm with her hand, I just held my cock and let her keep me.</p> <p>Eventually we broke the kiss. My mouth was open, and I could taste herself and her. For a long moment, we were just looking at each others' eyes, then the intensity of the moment changed, and I saw her kiss again, as she squeezed her hand around my cock. As she did that, her lips opened and my cock slid inside and I could feel her tongue on my cheek, then at other parts of my face. Then she kissed my mouth again, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
