A strange voice announced a very sweetly-ass voice. It sounded like an English accent.</p> <p>He said, "I am sorry. I didn't mean to scare you."</p> <p>I replied, "That's okay, but I feel a little under-the-wire."</p> <p>As he said it again a third time he said, "You know, your little body doesn't want to go in."</p> <p>With that she started to giggle and I thought he was starting to get nervous. She said that if I wanted anything that I should ask. He said that he couldn't because he didn't have a girlfriend or anything but it was okay; I wanted to go for that. She agreed and I followed suit. I went to the restroom and relieved my bladder. They both had a beer in their hands and they smiled and laughed at the same time. The waitress was there in just her bra and panties. I got on the floor and took her panties off, but not just yet. The man said his girlfriend wasn't feeling well and he'd drive her back then let me try me.</p> <p>The two of us walked into the bedroom and the light was off and I saw that the guy was just as naked as I was. He grabbed the clothes off the bed and walked over to the bed and asked me to undress him. I did and sat watching him as he got on the bed naked, even more so when I saw he already had two erections pointing at the ceiling. He looked over at me and asked if I might put them in for him, but I declined. He smiled at me and said, "That was my idea."</p> <p>I told him it sounded like fun. He picked up my underwear and said no thanks. He grabbed my bra and pulled me over to him. He put my shirt on too and told me to get naked and get it over him. His penis was rock hard and pointing up in front of him. He looked at me and said, "I think I'm ready to try yours."</p> <p>I unbuttoned his pants and let them drop to the floor. I reached up and pulled his underwear down and off and then pulled down his briefs and all of his hard cock was exposed. "It's beautiful," I said smiling.</p> <p>He said that it felt like my dick and that didn't even stick out at all and that he couldn't get it up for me. He grabbed me and pulled me on the bed so I could get on my knees. Then he pulled me down on the edge of the bed and pulled my panties off too. He kissed me very hard but just as I felt his hard penis entering my vagina. I felt like I was going to faint from the sensations. The one thing that I was feeling really good right now was being inside a warm, wet, and tight pussy.</p> <p>He grabbed my ass and started to really thrust, pushing his cock deep inside me. The sound of his body rubbing mine was almost more than I could stand and I came right then. I could feel that it didn't take much before I felt my juices starting to pour out of me into his pubic hair, over his cock, and over my own thighs. He didn't let up but just kept pounding away at me, just a little harder each time. The orgasms were strong, but that one just wasn't enough, so I had to go with it. I was still shaking from the first one but now he was also going as hard as he could, giving me more orgasms and then I was going too and just lay there exhausted.</p> <p>I don't know how long we lay there. I was still covered with his ejaculation, but it was so erotic and so erotic that I lost track of time. But when I finally rolled over on my side I could feel his sperm running down my legs and even down to my butt. Then I turned over on my back and he fell beside me and cuddled me with his arm. We just laid there, feeling very warm, happy and content. When he slipped off to the bathroom he said there was another bottle of wine that was nearby so he wouldn't have to do that. So he got dressed without even getting up and left the bedroom.</p> <p>I felt like the proverbial saucer being put back in the barrel. My next experience with a big, strong cock seemed like a fairy tale. For me and my boyfriend. I was just a little apprehensive about what was to come, but I enjoyed it and told him so. He said he should get out of here and go have a few beers. So I got up and made my way to the bathroom. He was standing at the door sipping wine and watching me as I came out. When he saw my nude body, he smiled and said my name.</p> <p>"Howâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
