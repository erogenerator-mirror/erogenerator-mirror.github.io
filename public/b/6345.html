"You seem nice to me too."</p> <p>"Thanks," he said softly. His heart was bursting to open and he felt a thrill rush through him at every word she spoke. He felt her take her hand away from his groin and he was sure she couldn't tell what he was getting at. He was so excited, so excited that he knew he couldn't go on. And with that though, his desire was quenched. This was something he knew he would never forget.</p> <p>She took his hand and led him through the main part of the house, into two rooms and up a big stone hallway. "This way," she said. He followed behind her and stopped in front of another closed door. She knocked then let the door slide open and stepped back into the hall. She took him in her arms and he let her run her hands up to his belt. Before he could respond she unfastened it and let his shorts fall. His erection sprang back to life as she ran her hands over his body and kissed him.</p> <p>She had already moved behind him and was kneeling in front of him and rubbing his erection tenting his boxers. He felt her hands and tongue running over it, over his balls and over his anus, up the shaft until it felt like it would explode at any second. Her tongue darted around the shaft and she was able to lick the full length of him, sliding up and down its glutes.</p> <p>Then she pulled his shorts over his erection and sat back down in an open chair, facing him. She pulled him by the cock and took a big breath before releasing him into her mouth. "Wow, that feels way different to me. You really are big, but I can get into almost any way." He started to talk through the whole thing, but she held him tight in her mouth, held him there, stroking his cock with her hands until he was breathing hard and almost begging her not to stop. Then she worked her mouth and hands toward the end of his shaft, never losing eye contact with him, toying with him all around her mouth and sliding her lips back and forth over the knob of his cock as she massaged him firmly between her thumb and forefinger.</p> <p>He watched as she used the back of her hand to stroke up and down on the shaft, and he had to fight the urge to reach down and touch himself. When she was in the same position as him, he was almost hypnotized. He reached up to her throat and held his hand there while he listened to her suckling him. He saw, as if in slow motion, he heard her lick the head of his cock from her fist to his pubic hair. Her hands stroked him in a gentle up and down rhythm, but there was something different to it. He could tell he had never felt anything as intense as this in his life, not even with his own wife.</p> <p>It was like nothing he'd ever experienced, and his mind was spinning with ecstasy. He heard himself asking her to do it, asking himself to do it, and all the words he'd been holding came spilling out of his mouth.</p> <p>She leaned closer and blew her hot breath on him. Suddenly her lips were against his cockhead, still stroking his soft organ with her tongue. Finally, all of him was in her mouth, he felt that warm, wet tongue moving against him. His whole body went stiff. There was no doubt what that sensation was, and the whole experience was beyond words that he could speak.</p> <p>She released him again and he watched as she ran her hand over her lips and tongue again, feeling him getting harder and harder in her mouth. She kept stroking up and down his length until he was fully erect and he knew she would probably suck him off again. For some reason this only made him want to go back to what he had been missing before all this excitement and his sexual frustration.</p> <p>He was about to turn around and leave when she slid him out of her mouth. He saw this new sexual experience between them again and he watched for a second as she put her mouth close to his lips and spoke first. "I hope you're not offended," she said.</p> <p>He didn't say anything so she kissed him. Then she put her mouth to his ear and whispered. "We won't make up, but maybe we could go for coffee."</p> <p>He thought about that for a bit and found it hard to believe. But he figured he would do anything for her if he didn't want her to leave.</p> <p>"And I'll bet you enjoyed it," she finished as she stood up from the chair and started dancing for him. She pulled his shirt off, unbuttoned his shirt and worked it slowly over his head, leaving his shirt open all the way. She rubbed his shoulders, neck and back, running her hands in circular patterns over him, squeezingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
