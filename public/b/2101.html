He placed his hand back under me, this time around my throat, I could feel his fingers pressing into me. He was using me as a test tube, and I loved it. This man wasn't just going to keep filling me up with that cock forever, but he was really going to try to cum inside me. I felt his fingers moving further, and I could feel his fingers spreading my pussy lips wide, and pushing the head of his cock into me. He began to enter me just a bit at first, his cock sliding slowly into my pussy, but it wasn't going in far. He started to withdraw again, this time when I felt him pressing against my cervix, it felt a lot faster this time. That cock of his was going to last long enough to make me cum again. He slowly started to push forward, and my whole body just took a little push back at him, it was all I could do to just stay on my knees. I leaned forward, my hand moving from the bed to my pussy. It was wet and slick from the wetness of my pussy earlier, and this cock of his wasn't even going past the opening. I rubbed my hand up and down my pussy again, getting my juices and coating the cock in my cum. I was having another orgasm, which was only second best of having to cum when the man pulled out of me. He got up onto his knees and came forward with me. I was already pretty well coated from my own wetness, but he just pushed forward into me again, his cock slipping just inside me, filling me up. He put it back into my pussy and began to rub it in circles in my pussy.</p> <p>"This is all for you baby," he said. He reached his hand back around me, feeling my wetness. "I think you will love this." He reached his hand up to my clit, rubbing it, sending little shivers up my body. I took a deep breath and exhaled again into his hand "This is for you too." and he began to pump his big cock back into me, pushing it in and out a bit and pulling it out to the head each time. He was starting to feel pretty good already, and I was loving the way the fucking of me with his cock turned me on, just like he had with his fingers when they went between my legs. My orgasm was getting closer, the pace of his strokes up and down my pussy was getting faster. My other hand was holding onto the headboard of the bed so I could brace myself for more of his cock. It was almost too much. My whole body was beginning to shake. I could feel another orgasm approaching, so I was going to cum again as well. "I think I'm going to cum!" was all I could say. He pulled himself out of me, my legs spread, so he could see my pussy, even as it still had his cock in it, wet and open, and he shot a load of cream all over me.</p> <p>"That was fucking amazing!" he said, "I'm not sure I can do this again."</p> <p>"I don't think so," I said, "I guess we only just finished. We weren't sure how long we could hold out thoughâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
