I was curious, and a little nervous. I had tried them at the grocery store and at my home the night before, and I didn't like the variety. Even at my house, I rarely saw anybody. At that hour in the sun, it should have been hard for me to get any food on my home plate. But it was the way we were eating...</p> <p>"You have this thing for food?" he finally asked.</p> <p>"How'd you guess he had a thing for it? I've heard from my best friend and her husband that he likes seafood too."</p> <p>"I thought you two had gone to Atlantic City with your parents."</p> <p>"I've been there a few times." I replied, "The day before, there was a food deal at a new restaurant. We had a great meal—a romantic seafood lunch."</p> <p>"Then he asked you if it was all right if we had one day off this weekend."</p> <p>I shook my head. "No, we didn't have one day off, so we would have to wait a week. My family got out of town before they could get anything done. They didn't have any plans. You are right. But this time we wouldn't be sitting down at the table, talking for two days. We would be enjoying our meal—and talking. It would be very romantic to sit down outside and talk to him in his restaurant for two days. I love his company, but I don't think he would like that."</p> <p>"I know you do," he said sarcastically. "But it'd be just as romantic to sit in public knowing our waiter would have a hard time keeping his appetite in check. Then you could get into his restaurant whenever you like."</p> <p>He was right. Of course, that wouldn't be as romantic. All he'd need was to get through a day of traveling. I could just tell you I wanted to live for that day, but there was no guarantee of that. But to have all of that time in the sun, to spend it with him... Yeah, that was very romantic. I really did.</p> <p>"So what does your wife have to talk about?" I said.</p> <p>"Her trip to London has been a big one for her. That wasn't the reason for you and her to get together. She's having dinner and a couple of drinks tonight... I know how she likes to celebrate her trip. And the next part is that you aren't here. She won't be home in a couple of hours." He had a point. Her date was on the boat. He'd come to visit, have some of his friends come on board, and the kids were going off to college. So it was a huge surprise to me when he said I wouldn't be with him. He had to know that. I mean, we would have to leave the rest of that night, and I would be there, and everything would be just fine between us. I didn't want to push him into making the big decision.</p> <p>"But we haven't yet, and he wouldn't be here. I'm sorry I don't already have you to meet... So how do you feel about it?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'm not sure I can go back to those places any faster than I do now. I don't know if there are any other places in the city we'd rather be."</p> <p>The waiter came over with our food and told us to eat inside, that he would be right back. As was true for me. I hadn't eaten all day. The food and the wine all had my blood running high. I was hungry and couldn't wait to come back and let this beautiful man have me again.</p> <p>"And I have a surprise for you that I'm sure you'll love, too," he said. He smiled, his smile so beautiful. His smile was so sexy that I'd melt in his gaze. I was speechless for a moment.</p> <p>"What is it?" I asked.</p> <p>"There's this man that I've never met before who lives at home, and has just invited me to come spend two days with him."</p> <p>I stared at him, unable to believe this was happening. It seemed like a small world, and he was the perfect candidate to start. "I'm not sure I... I mean... I don't know..." I stumbled, as I couldn't see the expression on his face... Oh, how things are changing for me in this life.</p> <p>"There's the guy that worked for us for two years. And I've known him forever."</p> <p>He leaned over to give me a lingering kiss, and I just wanted him there, with me, forever—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
