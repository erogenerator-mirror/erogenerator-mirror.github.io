I stared at my hair. I still hated how it looked, how I couldn't shake it as it kept being brushed back and forth between my long hair and my shoulders.</p> <p>I started running my finger under it and around my lip, and then to my neck, and my face. I rubbed myself from the neck down, rubbing my finger under my lips and around my clit before rubbing it back up again, a little bit harder in response to each stroke. I slowly went back down to my knees. I spread my legs wide without moving them. I watched as my finger played with myself, and then went back upward.</p> <p>"I think there will be no harm, do you want to stop me?"</p> <p>My heart raced, I could feel my heart pounding inside me. My body jumped, almost immediately the thought that it couldn't be happening came to me, and then the orgasm that had been a little more than I thought it would...</p> <p>"Y-yes." Was all I said, and then turned back, looking at her. Her eyes were pleading and questioning.</p> <p>"I think we should stop. Don't you?"</p> <p>I nodded. "Then, after I have cleaned myself up..."</p> <p>I ran my finger down my face, and then to the neckline of my shirt. I pulled the top down slowly, letting the buttons fall to the sides. I took my shirt off, and laid it over the edge of the tub. It was chilly from the water, my nipples hardened instantly from the breeze that was passing through it. I ran my hands down my stomach, then my hips, stopping at the waistband of my jeans, and slowly, pulling them down. They slid all the way down to my ankles, and then I kicked them off, leaving me completely naked except for my socks. I turned back around to face the mirror, and ran my finger along my lips and over myself once again.</p> <p>"Are you ready?"</p> <p>I nodded yes, feeling my stomach quiver as the cold water slid down over me. I smiled, and then ran my finger over my ass. I slipped my finger into the ass, just one finger, pulling, stretching it. I pushed in a little deeper, and pulled it all the way out. I ran it all over my lips. I smiled down at her, not quite sure what to say for all the times I had looked at her and felt jealous of her. It had been more a question of what to do next... I never expected her to let me have an orgasm just to see her again. Even if I did, I doubted I would still be here.</p> <p>"Okay." I said, my voice shaking slightly. My hands dropped at my sides, and the shock wave subsided, but my eyes stayed locked with hers staring back through the mirror and trying to read where I had felt my heart beating. "If you'd like, you can do it standing up, no one is going to be able to see you from the outside." I pulled at the towel and pulled it off my head, and then stood in front of her. Her eyes widened, and she grabbed my hand and pulled me towards her, kissing me on the lips, but not on my mouth. The kiss was deep and passionate, our kiss lasting no time at all, but being very soft and almost chaste.</p> <p>As we kissed, she slipped my shirt off, one piece of fabric at a time. As our bodies met, I couldn't help smiling, as I had not planned it to happen, but I quickly forgot that that time had past. We were both naked now, my own hard cock pressing against her tummy. My chestnut hair was wet from the shower, and my cock pressed against her pussy, wanting so much more than just her body.</p> <p>She stopped the kiss and pulled away. "I don't want to waste the water, and we wouldn't want our parents to be here." She then started to untie my shirt, and pull it off and my boxers. I stepped out of them, and then stood back as she started to take off her own shoes. I walked away from her slowly.</p> <p>When I got back to her, she turned around, and I felt her hands go to my shirt. I felt her hands work on my shirt, pulling it up slowly and letting it hang on my shoulder, one arm going around my waist, the other going back down my back, my hand coming up to my stomach. She reached to untie my own shoes, and I slid the pants off, leaving just my socks on.</p> <p>"Wait a second." She said, putting her arms on the edge of the tub and holding her legs out, then sitting down, her legs falling down to her side. I felt her hands go to my backâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
