I've... been thinking about you all day..."</p> <p>I smile inwardly as a tear rolls down my cheek once more. I knew that you must be thinking I was a lying bitch, and the thought of you having an affect on me makes my insides tremble. A wave of warmth and passion passes over me and I lean forward to hold you, and I press myself into your arm and we fall into the couch with a kiss. Our lips brush across an unseen mark on your cheek and I know that this moment has to be our last. I turn to face you, and see your eyes were open, and I want to see them again. Your hands slide down along my naked body, pulling me back into you. I feel the warmth of your breath on my lips, but I didn't let go. I let you kiss me, and I feel you shift your hips so that your cock is between my thighs.</p> <p>You break the kiss abruptly and tell me to kneel on the couch, and you take the pillows and throw them on the floor. You stand in front of me. I raise my eyes to your gaze, and you lean close to my face, and kiss me deeply. Your lips are hot against mine, and your tongue slips between my lips to explore my mouth as it dances with yours. I wrap my arms around your neck as you press your body into me, and I feel your hands kneading my buttocks. I arch against you back, enjoying the sensation of your lips, your breath, and the heat emanating from the tips of your fingers as your touch works between my legs. Your lips leave mine and meet my eyes between kisses. I'm in seventh heaven. You tell me to lay on the pillows, and I lie down, looking at the ceiling as you sit in front of me. You come forward, and slide the head of your cock along my slit, rubbing the head against my clit, and over the lips of my pussy. With the head pressed against you, I spread my legs wider, feeling the moist warmth of your cock and balls against my naked thighs. I arch toward you, wanting you inside me, so badly that I think I may explode with desire and want to pull you inside me. You lean forward, and slowly press your head into me. The head of your cock probes the inner walls of the innermost recess, a hotness that draws a moan from my lips. You're too impatient, and begin to pump your cock into me slowly, inch by inch, the sensation of your penis against my naked flesh bringing tears to my eyes, yet the feeling of your hot cock filling me so completely, I feel as if I'd cum again right there. The walls of my vagina wrap you so tight, and my clitoris throbs. I want to kiss you. I want to tell you the truth: I want to tell the truth about the feeling of your cock as it fucks me.</p> <p>"I've been dreaming of your cock for so long," I tell you. "Let me feel its stiffness in my hand, please."</p> <p>You move closer to me, placing your hands on my waist, your cock just touching my opening, and your thumbs rubbing my clit as you thrust in and out of me with measured strokes, and I arch upward in the couch to meet you with every stroke, crying out in passion at each insertion. You feel it, I feel it, and I feel the pleasure of the feelings running through me, and you can feel me quiver with an intense heat in response to you being inside me, and then you are moving faster and faster, and I can feel you tense as you fill me with your cum, and you cry out in one last explosion of your passion. After some moments, you move out of me, and take me in your arms. I reach for your cock and pull it to my mouth where I lick the pre-cum from its head, and then I suck on it, running my tongue around it and into my mouth. "Mmm," I say, "it tastes so good!"</p> <p>You lean onto your elbow, and we watch each of us in the mirror. "I'll always love you," you say as you caress my back.</p> <p>"I love you too, tooâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
