It was 8:00am. We had all gone to bed early. He had brought me a drink, just to get things started. The fact that I was sleeping this late didn't hurt us in the least. We snuggled up together under the blankets, watching some late-night comedy on television as the two of us fell asleep on one another's bodies.</p> <p>I was half-asleep, but I never wanted to part from the kiss until we had talked enough to get out of bed before morning's alarm. He kissed my shoulder, his mouth working its way down to my breast. His hand cupped my right hand and my nipple hardened from the first caress as it slipped into his palm. His mouth continued to playfully tease the nipple. Suddenly, he brought his mouth over my mouth as he lifted himself away and sat upright, his hand moving over my chest to cover my heart. I knew it was beating quickly. I felt the heat and hardness of his hardness under his boxers. He felt it too, I suspected. I looked towards the alarm clock and knew I had only a few minutes before we had to get moving. I turned my face back towards the ceiling. He quickly shifted himself on his side so that my face was facing his face. His erection was now close to my mouth. I slowly moved my head towards it but did not take its head into my mouth. His finger was now stroking my hair as he pulled back, letting the head rest just outside my lips.</p> <p>I closed my eyes, feeling him pushing his hardness onto my cheek and then pushing up against my lips. I knew what was coming. It always did when he would push his boxers down into his lap. When he would let them stay that way.</p> <p>He let his boxers fall down my body. I was now the one who was naked. I wanted to go back to our previous positions. As he leaned over to gently kiss my lips, his hand now stroked my chest before trailing down over my nipple, cupping and rolling it. He ran his fingers down to my other breast, causing me to arch into his hand.</p> <p>His mouth quickly devoured my nipple. His hand moved from my chest to my left breast. He stroked it gently and teased it between his fingers as he kissed my lips. His fingers explored my mouth and tongue, then up my jaw. One arm reached up to playfully tickle my chest. His hand continued to toy with my nipple as his other hand gently explored my face, neck and chest. I had no desire to protest, however.</p> <p>Suddenly, his hand slid down to cup my breast. He kneaded it softly, not really trying to harden it but simply using it to make a soft, round orb. I let out a soundless moan as he teased the head of my nipple again, before sliding his fingers slowly down towards my navel. He slowly moved his fingers down, tracing every last inch of my stomach. I felt his fingertip dip down to rest at my belly button. He was already tracing the outline of the dark, curly hair that was hiding my mound.</p> <p>His hand continued to tease mine, both of us feeling what the other had felt moments before, but our eyes did not return. My breathing started to become ragged.</p> <p>I finally spoke. "Honey, I can't take it anymore. You're taking me back to bed."</p> <p>"I'm going to take you back to bed, sweetheart." He replied, his voice muffled by the fabric of his boxers.</p> <p>"I don't care where we go."</p> <p>"No, no, we are going to have sex." Then his eyes opened and he looked at me. "Do you still want to eat me?"</p> <p>My breath caught in my chest. Was he taking that big chance with this? What would I say if he did?</p> <p>Again without a word, he began to slowly turn himself on the bed and lie down. A slight grin crossed his face as his cock jutted out of the thin, blue cotton fabric. His fingers slowly unbuttoned and unzipped my pyjama. As his hands began to move my pyjama to my knees, he slipped his hands inside my panties, slowly sliding them down as he slid his fingers deep into my bush. His fingers were coated with my moisture. I felt a rush of excitement as he probed my depths, feeling my slick juices as he slowly moved his fingers up and down my slit. He teased my clit, just barely brushing it as he teased me. I moaned quietly as his finger slipped inside my body. He continued the same movement inside me while his other hand stroked up and down over my stomach, over the hairless mound, and down to my mound.</p> <p>Then, he slowlyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
