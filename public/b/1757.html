Her body tensed in sympathy with her own building orgasm.</p> <p>"Do it," he insisted. The bed shook as they continued to fuck. "Do it," he insisted again, as he slipped one of his long fingers into her soaking pussy. "Do it right," he commanded. His cock slid into her wetness and they both came at the exact same time.</p> <p>They rested on the bed for a while until he had to move to get some work done.</p> <p>"You know, it's been too long I've got to go back to work before I'm back home," he said.</p> <p>"I understand. I have a lot of work to get done before we get here," she said.</p> <p>As he left, it occurred to him that he could go back to work. He wasn't that long. And he wasn't that late.</p> <p>Just the same he was not at home and didn't have an extension of his own. When the phone dinged, he opened it. It was Amanda.</p> <p>"Hey sweet." He was surprised to hear it from her. "I thought so. I didn't expect you to get home so soon."</p> <p>"I was kind of busy," she said. "So have a nice trip, you?"</p> <p>"Sure, you are welcome to come too if you like," he said hopefully.</p> <p>"How come you aren't the one coming?" She asked.</p> <p>"I got some bad news," he said.</p> <p>"Oh," she said. "What's that?" she asked.</p> <p>"When you were fucking Steve in the shower," he said. "He left a video."</p> <p>"Really? And you didn't tell me?"</p> <p>"No. We both had fun," he said. "And it was very different for me to go in there. Not because Steve went," he paused. He knew she was still horny from the morning's activities, and it was possible that his words hadn't been for her. "Well, after he left, we fooled around, and it started out with me sucking his cock," he said.</p> <p>"I guess so then," she said. "But the video isn't really for you, is it?"</p> <p>"No," he said. "It's for Dave."</p> <p>"Oh." She was obviously upset.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," he said.</p> <p>"I'll always love you," she said. "Don't worry about it. You were so good to me that I didn't know what I was missing. And I know you don't."</p> <p>"I'll always be here when you need me. We'll do it again," he promised.</p> <p>"We'll do it again," she said again.</p> <p>"I know," he answered. "I promise."</p> <p>"I'll call you later," she stated. "I can't wait to see what it is you're planning to do with him."</p> <p>"You are so nasty," he said.</p> <p>"And you'll love it," she said. "I'm not sure how the rest of the trip will fit."</p> <p>"I know. I'm sorry."</p> <p>"Don't worry," she assured him. "You'll love it."</p> <p>Her mind spun as she thought how her last conversation with Steve had changed so quickly.</p> <p>A day later, Amanda had already called Steve and told him that she had a "surprise" coming. She quickly explained how she planned on having him over for dinner, and then watching him get laid.</p> <p>Steve agreed to the surprise. The first date was set up between Amanda and him. It would be their first date, but the first thing to happen would be the actual marriage. Amanda was already in her room when he walked her down to the kitchen.</p> <p>"Are you ready for dinner?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes," she said.</p> <p>"Are you dressed for that?" he continued.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"It's a good thing you didn't wear any panties," he said. "It sounds good on the television."</p> <p>They sat down, Amanda on the couch with her legs pulled up next to her.</p> <p>"So is this the real reason you asked me out?" She asked him as they ate dinner. "This is your birthday present," she said.</p> <p>"It sure is," he agreed.</p> <p>They finished dinner with her wearing just a short dress, but nothing else.</p> <p>"I think that's enough," she said. "I think that's enough."</p> <p>They returned to the living room, and Amanda sat next to Steve.</p> <p>"It's been a long time," she said. "Even longer than the weddingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
