It's just that I'm thinking about you... your body, your eyes, your lips... I've noticed your body ever since we first met."</p> <p>"Yes, I guess you're aware, but I haven't seen you... I mean, have you... "</p> <p>"Well, you can look at me when it's convenient," I said with a wink. "I like to see you and maybe you can look at me... "</p> <p>"Oh, no, I'm a married woman. Not my husband, or my boyfriend. If your husband goes off on his business and comes back I don't want to see him again. And, as I've told everyone, if he does come back I won't be mad. If he doesn't come back, I don't want him to have any contact with me. If you're not happy with him, just leave him to me. Now go!"</p> <p>"Yes, I am, ma'am. I won't stay long," as she scurried away.</p> <p>I walked towards the door and stopped. The last thing I wanted to do was make a scene. My wife, who I've been with since college, is not home, so maybe it's best that I come back. I opened the door and stood outside.</p> <p>"Hmmm, hello there baby," I said as I put out my tongue. "Oh man, I just remembered you told me to have fun today," my mouth descended to meet hers.</p> <p>"Hey, I'm sorry about this morning," my tongue probed her mouth. "It's not what you think. Actually, I like the way things are going," I said as I held her face in between my thighs.</p> <p>"Baby, I'm not going anywhere," she said. "I don't mind you getting down in the sack, but don't expect me to be all over you. I need to get out of here, so can I just... ummm, well..." I could feel her breath against my ear as she tried to say that.</p> <p>My arm circled her waist and pulled her into me. "Oh yes, you have been wanting this all day, haven't you, my young wife?" I nibbled her lip and let my fingers roam her naked back and hips, finally settling on her hot, wet pussy.</p> <p>"Yes, I've... " I pulled away and stood. "Let's get something straight, baby. I want to fuck you!"</p> <p>"I didn't bring anything for you to wear today. I'm not really into that much. I can barely walk around with you here," she said.</p> <p>"You won't be embarrassed or uncomfortable if you wear whatever you need," I said. "It's not necessary to wear any thing, but I'd like to help you get dressed."</p> <p>"Honey, don't make me change. It's not what I need, it's who I'm about to fuck, but what you're going to be wearing, you'll find out when you're dressed," she said and went to get her things.</p> <p>I went into the bathroom and quickly changed. As I turned to leave I took her by the hand and pulled her back into my arms. She could feel my cock start to rise and grind against her thigh.</p> <p>"Mmmm, you are such a bad, bad girl," I said and leaned over to kiss her.</p> <p>She put her arms around me, crushing her tits against my hard chest. I could feel my cock throb against her.</p> <p>"That's it, honey. Show me how much you want me to fuck you, how many times today I've wondered what it would be like to slip my cock into you. Tell me how much you want this, baby," I purred as I kissed her again.</p> <p>"Honey, I think you'll enjoy it. Your hands have all the fun. Your lips, your tongue, your legs. And, your pussy, baby," I said as my hands snaked through her soft hair, pulling it back from her beautiful face.</p> <p>"Oh yes, I'm going to enjoy this!" she said as she reached down and started to rub my cock through my pants.</p> <p>It was as if we were connected on fire. I reached down to grab the back of her head, pulled her to me and slid my tongue between her teeth. She was moaning and making soft, whimpering sounds as she sucked on my tongue. Her hands were running all over the top of me, kneading and rubbing.</p> <p>This was heaven and hell in a world of pleasure and pain. It just kept going the better I made it. I had to have more. I wanted every last inch of her bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
