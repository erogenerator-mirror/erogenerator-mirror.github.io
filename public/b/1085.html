Her hair framed and accented her gorgeous face. She knew that she wouldn't be able to resist when she was getting ready for his big cock. She quickly grabbed hold of her panties and pulled them off and down to the floor with a clatter as she got on to her belly with her feet over the side of the bed.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful," he said stroking the side of her head.</p> <p>She felt so sexy, so vulnerable. "That's why I'm here," she said.</p> <p>"You'll see."</p> <p>She didn't really care where it went. She felt that she wanted to.</p> <p>"Now," she said.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Come here for a good kiss."</p> <p>A kiss.</p> <p>She opened her mouth and gave his cock a lingering lick. "Oooh. That's nice."</p> <p>"Mmm. Just the way I like it."</p> <p>"Really good?"</p> <p>"You can say it." She kissed his cock a little longer, and took a hold of it. "I think I'll keep doing that for a while."</p> <p>He moaned as she began to stroke him. Her lips were wet just a little, and there wasn't any tongue. But he was very hard. It would be even harder if she kept doing that for a while.</p> <p>"Just a minute."</p> <p>When all of the buttons were undone she pulled her panties right off him. She laid her head on his thigh, watching him intently. What a sight it was! It wasn't the boy she was usually looking at, instead it was the woman who seemed to be the hottest of the females at the mall, and she was very sexy! Her legs were spread slightly, like a spread eagle that she had been wearing to the mall, and it looked good. She could feel the cool air on her bare skin. She was almost tempted to just get up and leave now, at first it would just scare her away, but she liked it. Then it would cause her to just giggle. "I'm just so excited it feels so good." It made her pussy tingle. "Do you feel that?"</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>"Feels good?"</p> <p>"Yeah. But you know what else it does to me?"</p> <p>"Tell me. Tell me what it does to your pussy."</p> <p>She let go of his cock and rolled over to her back, but instead of his cock she kept stroking it. The contrast of her fingers on her pussy made her feel horny. She got very close when he slid up her body, but stopped her. "What's the matter?" she demanded.</p> <p>"Well, if you'd like it to feel better."</p> <p>"Well....oh, I suppose I do..."</p> <p>"But you don't have a choice here."</p> <p>He was straddling her body now.</p> <p>"Ooh." She smiled.</p> <p>She wanted to give him something. Something to play with, so she reached out with her hands and began to stroke him. "That's good."</p> <p>"Yeah. Okay."</p> <p>"This is so sexy..."</p> <p>"Uh huh..."</p> <p>"Want to make it better?"</p> <p>She was getting close, but didn't want to make him stop. "I'm going to cum."</p> <p>He rolled off of her and laid down next to her. She turned over and looked at him. "Are you still hard? I'm so wet right now..." She could hear his cock starting to get hard again. "I want you in me. Now."</p> <p>"No. Not yet." He got between her legs and slid his cock into her.</p> <p>As he slid in, she began to rock in his lap, her hands running up and down his body. "Oh, what is that?"</p> <p>"You know."</p> <p>"You do that, don't you?"</p> <p>"You like that?"</p> <p>"Yeah." He picked her up, moved her feet to his stomach and held her tightly as he began to move her with long strokes.</p> <p>She was loving the ride. She wanted what he was about to do to her, and she certainly didn't want to get off. But she couldn't let him go so easily.</p> <p>"Oh..."</p> <p>"Yes!" He pumped deeper into her.</p> <p>She felt herself reaching orgasm.</p> <p>"I'm about to...."</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>"Cumming, do it. Don't stop."</p> <p>"Uh huhâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
