He was a strong-looking guy – well built, good-looking, with brown eyes and curly, light brown hair. He had a big smile, and I thought he looked terrific.</p> <p>"I'm Mike," he said.</p> <p>"Nice to meet you, Mike. What can I take you to this evening?"</p> <p>"A really nice surprise, you know," he said. "There aren't any fancy restaurants at my place, but I don't have anything special at my house. Why don't we meet at my apartment on the way and we can go to dinner before we go to the bar?"</p> <p>"That sounds nice to me," I said.</p> <p>"No, it's no surprise to you," he said. He shook his head, as if he couldn't believe it. "No special people there? Where'll we go?"</p> <p>"You know. Somewhere private and fun, no special rules, no judgments. Let's see, I thought there were some good shows in my place. I thought you'd want to take me as your date," I replied.</p> <p>"I don't. I don't like public places. It's so... private. I can't have anybody seeing me naked. I'd be embarrassed. I mean, I like the idea of you being a voyeur. But..." he hesitated.</p> <p>"Don't you want to know what I'd wear?" he said. He looked down at his hands and was about to stand up when he thought better of it.</p> <p>"No", I said, "I'd probably go home to my wife. Or to my kids. I know, I don't like having to wear a dress and blouse with no bra. But, I'd like it if you knew what I really liked."</p> <p>"Sure, okay; maybe tonight we can take our clothes off."</p> <p>My heart jumped. The thought of having him naked just to put the coat on – and for me to have it on – was something I'd done before – the thought that it was a 'naked thing' that I was doing in front of him. But what was this 'naked thing' that I was wearing?</p> <p>"Mike, where are we going?" I asked.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Where we go to eat? You like the idea of us going out somewhere. I guess you really like the idea of a woman taking you places you don't think she wants to go, where the guy will be naked if he is willing. Maybe he'll put clothes on."</p> <p>"Yeah," he said, "It would be fun. I mean, I like that idea – the idea of it, you know – the way you are taking care of me."</p> <p>"Yes, it would be fun. This is going out; we're doing it, isn't it? There is no going home. Not that I know the other way around. When you took my coat off, I was nude, in your living room. We could see your neighbor in the window, or out in daylight."</p> <p>I said, "That would be nice. But, maybe we should have stayed and talked some."</p> <p>"It wouldn't have been so bad," he said. "You're getting to know me too well. The more I see you, the more I can't get enough." He looked back up at me. His eyes were looking down into the depths of my eyes as he said, "It's been a long time," but he didn't say anything else. He closed his eyes briefly, then opened them again and looked back me in the eyes. He closed his eyes again. He looked up at the ceiling, and smiled.</p> <p>"Let's pick our dinner, first. Then, we can get more comfortable. What do you think?" he asked.</p> <p>"I think your offer is okay. What do you like, Mike? Whatever we want to do?"</p> <p>"That would be nice," he said.</p> <p>"Let's meet in my apartment in less than a minute and discuss this," I said.</p> <p>"Okay," he answered, "Let's go for a drive. If you change your mind, I'll see you at a restaurant I know."</p> <p>He had a lot of staying power in that phrase, but I didn't want to take it off, and I didn't want to lose him. When we reached his apartment in less than a minute, he said, "I think we can pick one of your outfits from that lot, in the car. I'll buy a new one for tonight, if I can arrange it."</p> <p>"OK with me? I'm sure it would be fun," I responded, "As long as we didn't have to wear anything.
