She looked down, "but I'm just...kind of excited about what happens next." As if to prove the point he grabbed her, "Do you feel the same way about it."</p> <p>"I didn't know what to think. Like you said I really feel the same way."</p> <p>As she looked down, she could see the way his penis bulged down the leg of his shorts, "Does your girlfriend do that too?"</p> <p>"Uh huh."</p> <p>"Yeah." She was still staring as he started rubbing her clit in slow circles.</p> <p>"And you don't feel weird about being with him?"</p> <p>"Well, maybe some guys," she giggled as she lifted her hips up slightly, "maybe some girls, yeah." But she felt his hand lower and lower until it was cupping her, "This felt like fun." He started rubbing her clit as he slid down, almost kissing her. This time, however, he was not kissing but just lightly sucking on her neck, "Oh that's good, don't forget to use more lube." After a minute of this he pulled his hand back, "Now let me make sure you're still really wet before I start."</p> <p>"Oh, good I'm not going anywhere." She rolled over to kiss him, "Can we finish this in your bed, ok?" There was a little squeal as she got up. As she bent over to kiss him, his hips rose, "Mmm, I think I want to do another round with you. Maybe even in bed." As she stood up, her skirt came up a few inches above her ass, "Oh, how does it...that feels good again?"</p> <p>"So do I, I love the feeling of your warm wet pussy on my leg." She ran her finger up and down his penis, "Mmmmm. Maybe I should put my pussy next to..."</p> <p>"Hey, I said I wanna do all of it. That's fine with me. I want you to be happy. It gives me a thrill to be with you like that."</p> <p>"I agree, and I am glad you feel the same way."</p> <p>She was still leaning over and her breasts were at eye level now as they rubbed together. Her eyes closed as his hand massaged her nipples, "Is everything ok?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I think it's great." She smiled, "You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. I still have a hard time believing the way you look naked. I can't tell you how much I've wanted you from the first time I saw you; that smile you've gotten."</p> <p>"We'd better get back to the hotel room." She slipped out of her skirt, "I was beginning to worry about you not being back with us." As she pulled her panties off, and got dressed, she knew that she was still horny.</p> <p>He opened the door and he took her hand. He was almost afraid to let go, "What?"</p> <p>"Just forget I'm you, and we're not together, just the two of us." As he looked back, she was so turned on that she almost couldn't keep her eyes on him even as she pulled him closer and kissed him once again. This time she didn't pull off his shorts, instead she helped him dress while she continued to softly rub him through his boxers. He reached down and squeezed her ass, pulling her tight against his manhood, "I'm going to take my clothes off. There's time for one more round." He gently pushed her back until she was sitting on his lap with his hard penis just resting against her pussy.</p> <p>She started to tease her tongue around his lips just a bit before she took him inside, "Uhm...maybe it's time..." In the time it had taken for him to get dressed she had already unbuttoned his pants and slid the zipper down. She leaned down to take his tip into her mouth, swirling her tongue around it as she began to run her tongue up and down his slit. It wasn't long before his penis wasn't doing that tricky trick around the tip.</p> <p>"That didn't feel like much, but nice."</p> <p>She smiled, "It's not that big for my body. I can just fit it in." She ran her tongue up his length, "Now get your pants off." He wasn't sure how much more he could take without getting a little excited, but he did as she handed him his pants and underwear. The only thing he was wearing in this apartment was his socks, but he didn't care. He started to turn out his chair to get dressed and was just about to turn and ask where his clothes were when he heard her scream, "FUCK."</p> <p>"I-ah, sorry, I-I didn't mean to come by andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
