She nodded.</p> <p>"This is...is very interesting."</p> <p>She smiled.</p> <p>"I think you can see it from my point of view," she said. "You see, my love, I've got nothing like what you have, and that doesn't mean nothing."</p> <p>Suddenly we were kissing; I put my arms around her and pulled her close. Our lips were now locked in a heated kiss and I could feel her passion burning in me.</p> <p>I broke the kiss and said, "I don't have to make love to you anymore, sweetheart. You know that. You and I will have plenty of time to decide what we would like to do." I could feel the desire in her as she was getting moist, and I knew I would continue to explore her body with my hand as soon as I felt that I could.</p> <p>I slid down to her breasts and felt the nipples harden. I began to massage her tits and moved my lips down to her belly button, kissing her there and making her squirm.</p> <p>"Oh, yes, that's it, honey; that feels exquisite," she breathed.</p> <p>I continued to rub up and down her thighs and over her pussy, and she opened her legs for me like a woman, allowing my tongue to enter inside her hot folds.</p> <p>I started to lick her pussy and she opened her legs wider to welcome me. I slid two fingers inside of her causing her to moan softly.</p> <p>I moved my mouth up and down, getting her as wet as I could. I felt her hands on my head and her legs were quivering as she moaned and squirmed on my face. Her breathing was becoming ragged as I slid my fingers back inside her as my tongue continued to explore her.</p> <p>I slid a finger inside of her as my lips found her clit and I began to lick and suck her.</p> <p>"Oh my God!" She cried out as my fingers returned inside of her pussy.</p> <p>I moved up to her face and kissed her lips and lips. I kissed between her ear, neck and chin while my finger was inside of her. Her legs were trembling as my mouth came to rest on her pussy, my mouth sucking on her lips.</p> <p>"Mmmm!" She let out as a sharp gasp.</p> <p>I felt her legs shaking as I slid my finger in and out of her pussy, the sounds of her breathing becoming louder.</p> <p>I sucked her clit into my mouth and moved my hand over her body, rubbing and rubbing against her flesh with my mouth. Her hands reached around me and started pulling my body up, forcing me down upon her.</p> <p>We shifted positions as I put my finger out of her pussy. She moaned as I pressed my head against her pussy and began to lick her sweet honey off of it. My head slid back as I saw her eyes open in ecstasy. I could feel her body trembling as I sucked her clit into my mouth. Her hips began to grind against me and her hands were on my head pulling me into her.</p> <p>"Oh, fuck!" she cried out. "My love, oh my love, oh my love." She cried out, and her back arched as her orgasm began to hit.</p> <p>I was enjoying the taste of her sweet pussy as I felt her muscles tightening. I could feel myself getting even harder.</p> <p>"Oh, God," she cried out. "OH, MY God!" Her voice was high-pitched and the sound of the word nearly deafening to me and I could hear every breath she took in.</p> <p>"Oh, God, Mary, yes, yes..." is all I could say at that point. Her hips were quivering as she climaxed and the sounds of her voice echoed around the room. Her eyes closed and she went rigid as her body began to shake.</p> <p>When she relaxed, I removed my mouth from her clit and moved up and lay on the other side of her. I moved across her stomach and kissed her stomach, then her breasts once again before turning and laying next to her on the bed.</p> <p>She put her arm over my shoulder and kissed my chest while her fingers started to run down my naked body. Her lips kissed my nipples and stomach, then her fingers found their way back up. She spread my legs open as she moved down to my cock and began to lick its length from its mushroom head to the base making me moan.</p> <p>She lifted my cock and then lowered herself once again onto it. She slowly lifted and then lowered her self until my cock was once again fully inside of her. She moved her body up and down for a while, sliding her pussy up and down my cock and making me moan for her.</p> <p>She moved her hips up and down again and again until my cock was deep inside ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
