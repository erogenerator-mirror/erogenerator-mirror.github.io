She's only about five-and-a-half feet tall."</p> <p>"I'll bet she's in the middle of her second day in the office, just the second day in the hospital. And if she's still there, she sure seems to be in the midst of a serious medical crisis."</p> <p>"Nah, she's just a cute little thing; just her sister's kind of an oddity around these parts I guess," I said with a shrug. "It's her nature to work hard to keep fit and healthy."</p> <p>"Oh, I don't know about that, Jake. I would like to see something a little more...natural."</p> <p>I chuckled. I was pretty confident that she would be fine in the confines of an old, old-fashioned hospital bed, so I was willing to risk a little more than just watching a little of the life and activity it had to offer. I glanced up at the clock on the wall, wondering why I was still here, just a few minutes before the receptionist and my doctor's scheduled appointment. I'd expected that they would be closing by the time I'd finally gotten off the phone with them. The room was quiet. I could hear a soft sigh and a murmur of some sort, if I chose.</p> <p>Suddenly, I could hear someone moving about the room, but it was all too short. I had the feeling that someone was getting off the bed and getting in the hallway with this nurse. She had something shiny, like a little metal ring on a hook somewhere on the wall next to the door. She stood, facing me, and slowly closed and locked the door. I waited, and when she walked into the room from the hallway, she looked exactly the same, except there was a slight, well-cut edge to everything about her that suggested that she really did get off when this kind of treatment was involved.</p> <p>"Hi, I'm Nurse Smith," she said, her voice husky, almost a croon. She seemed completely oblivious to what might be happening right in front of her. I stepped back out of my room and looked around the room. There seemed to be a good-sized storage room, though, with only one bed frame. The table on the opposite wall looked to be at a right angle from some sort of wall. The window looked out over the river below. "Oh, my God! He isn't even trying to help you," I thought again. I hadn't expected to walk in here and find her in the darkness. She looked so different.</p> <p>"Uh, hi, it's me, Kelly," she said, still facing me. There was the slightest, wispy trace of a beard brushing against her cheek, and her eyes had a slightly slanted greenish tint to them that told me that she was at least fifteen years of age. "I just left my doctor's appointments today, so don't worry. I'm here to get back to him. I think he was in the bathroom again when I arrived. I, uh," her voice trailed off as her fingers traced a line down her cheek. "Just a little bit of me, but he can get a little rough sometimes," she continued, as she raised her eyebrow in a little smirk. I shook my head, trying not to let my own feelings or thoughts interfere with what my subconscious was asking me to do. My subconscious had been expecting the same kind of treatment that I had. She looked incredible.</p> <p>She stepped forward. In what was normally a very brief moment, she wrapped her arms around my neck and then, slowly, kissed me. Softly and tentatively at first, but very quickly, as she drew closer, our arms began sliding down each other's backs, to the small of our backs.</p> <p>"Oh, Kelly," I breathed. "That feels so nice, you're so soft, and wonderful, too."</p> <p>Her lips were suddenly on mine, and she pressed herself against me as she kissed me, pressing her lips against mine and running her tongue along my lips. I didn't respond, because I'd wanted to. I wanted her too, but I couldn't. She kissed me as though I were a part of her, which I knew was true. She pulled back, looked at me, for the first time, and she seemed quite pleased with herself. She smiled as she wiped away a tear from her face. It was a happy smile, just as hers had always been.</p> <p>"Oh, my God, Jake. I have never, ever, felt anything like that. It's unbelievable!"</p> <p>She suddenly reached out and took my hands, placing them on her shoulders. I didn't protest. I didn't want to. So I just touched her shoulder lightly, and she pressed her lips against mine again.</p> <p>"I just wanted to do this once" she whispered, so softly itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
