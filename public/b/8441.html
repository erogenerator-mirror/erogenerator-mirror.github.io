What, what shall I do?"</p> <p>"You can't go with anyone."</p> <p>"A guy like you, is that a problem?"</p> <p>"No, it's a big one." She answered as she leaned back a bit and looked at the bed. "Well you can take me there."</p> <p>"No, I would rather see you naked," he said as he climbed on the bed and positioned her between his spread legs. "Or I could just take off you."</p> <p>Liz had only intended to take off her shirt, but she didn't mind that she wasn't wearing a bra. He was pretty muscular and he had muscular thighs and calf muscles and he was standing, holding himself up on his elbows. As he took off his shirt, she removed her bra. "See, I told you I wasn't wearing a bra." She said playfully. He just grinned, he said "no way." He removed his shorts and then kicked them aside. Liz took her underwear off too, and then she was naked. "Wow, you have some endurance." She said admiring his naked body. "You have a really nice build."</p> <p>"Thanks."</p> <p>"You look great."</p> <p>"Can I take a shower when I get back?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I'd be embarrassed."</p> <p>"Why would you be embarrassed? You have a good body."</p> <p>"Thanks."</p> <p>"Do you know why I came in here? I figured I could have you for one night."</p> <p>"Don't you remember, I said to go ahead a second." She said and then he was between her legs again. Her pussy dripped juice onto him. "Damn, you got real sweet."</p> <p>"You might say that," he said as he began licking her pussy. She squirmed as she had a hard time concentrating on her breathing. "That's nice." He answered as he tongued her pussy.</p> <p>Liz pulled them away from her boyfriend and slid back a little. She watched him as he licked her and she felt very wicked and turned on knowing how much she enjoyed having his talented tongue on her. While he tongued her, he kept rubbing her clitoris. She felt his fingers sliding through her soft brown pubic hair just inside her opening. The feeling was too good for her to get enough time to think about. When his tongue found her clitoris again, she arched and pressed against his face. His tongue was gentle and she could feel herself about to release.</p> <p>"Oh I'm going to cum like I never have before!" she whispered. The orgasm was quick compared to the feeling of his mouth on her pussy. She could feel her pussy contracting around his fingers. She arched up as she pressed her pussy against him. "It's okay, I'm okay." She said as she relaxed. "Let's go get some sleep."</p> <p>As they showered, they talked about all their dreams. "I don't think I've ever had more than three orgasms." He said, "I've been thinking about my girlfriend for a long time."</p> <p>"Didn't you?" Liz asked.</p> <p>"Yes, every day for almost an hour. But I think I would like to keep having two."</p> <p>"It's a deal."</p> <p>After they had bathed and dried themselves off, they dressed and went out to the dining hall. There were lots of seats available and a pretty large table was set. It wasn't unusual for them there to be in the dark, but she noticed that there were two women in the room. Two women, one looking at her body, and one looking at a book on the table.</p> <p>They were not sitting to eat but to share what they were eating. The conversation was easy. When her boyfriend walked up, Liz stood up. "Come with me." And she took her boyfriend into a little dance club for the first time in a very long time. When they returned to the table, Liz was smiling broadly. "Are you ready for your little party again?"</p> <p>"Oh, yeah."</p> <p>As they sat down, Liz said "My little party is having some fun."</p> <p>"You're right."</p> <p>She gave him a hug and kissed him on his cheek. "See you next week?"</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>"Maybe we'll go out again."</p> <p>Liz told her boyfriend as they walked out that she wasn't going to take his girlfriend home. When she leaned forward and kissed him on the cheek, she said "That would be nice."</p> <p>"Well, thanks for dinner. I really needed that."</p> <p>Liz kissed him again and gave him a quick, gentle kiss. They were going to go out next week, butâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
