And it is hard to believe that I would be here with you if I didn't."</p> <p>I thought over my feelings for her and felt that I could talk to her, "You mean that everything you do for her has made a positive impact on things between us?"</p> <p>She laughed, "The things I did for you is only going to happen if you want it to come true." I said, "Do you want to see what we have to work with?"</p> <p>She had a serious look on her face, "Yes. Are you prepared for your own private tour?"</p> <p>"Are you sure? I am really scared."</p> <p>"Trust me, you're safe. You need to know how this is going to work".</p> <p>"All of this is going to be about going to New Years, so I just want to know. Are you ready?"</p> <p>"I'm really not sure about this, but maybe I can just see where things will go."</p> <p>She smiled, "All I can say is that the more time you spend here, the more you will be able to give me the most amazing love gift I have ever felt."</p> <p>So that's how things went from January 30, through the year to January 15 and back again to January 14. At times I felt like I had no control. Other times I was a total freak.</p> <p>On the night I signed the birth control prescription and began to make love to her on her stomach on the plane she said, "You have me on the pill. It's going to be so much better and I love you for giving me such love."</p> <p>Amber kissed me as I lay down on our bed with nothing but her and the pill in my ass. But I had promised to leave her side if I didn't.</p> <p>The next morning we got up, we showered, got dressed, packed, then out the door on our way to the airport.</p> <p>We were both tired from the day, so it was just a matter of being home with her. I felt the same way, except I didn't give her much to do while being with her.</p> <p>She had left a note when I finally arrived, along with the new pictures on my computer.</p> <p>"I would have been able to spend a few days with you but I was afraid that you would have wanted me to."</p> <p>"I would have loved to see everything that happened. Thank you very much."</p> <p>I looked at her, "You are so beautiful honey, but you don't have to come to the States for our anniversary. I am going to the Caribbean to celebrate with you, you know, with our family. Why do you think I sent you the pictures?"</p> <p>She replied, "I didn't want to tell you but I love you. And you are a wonderful man."</p> <p>I said, "I think it's time that we did something about being together again."</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>I said, "The only thing we are talking about is my leaving you to me so you can be with me again."</p> <p>She said, "That's nice. You have no idea how much that means to me. I love you more than anything that I have ever loved anyone before. Thank you for caring so for me. Love you Amber, I know how much you mean to me and I will let you stay with me if you want."</p> <p>She had tears in her eyes. She didn't know it but I could tell she was hurting a little. "I don't know why, but I think I really like you. I don't know how I'll turn twenty but I know that I need to see you and kiss you every day for two, sometimes three days."</p> <p>I felt that the whole time that I talked to her, I could see her feeling so very, very much in love.</p> <p>I looked at her and said, "All it would take is a kiss to get you started on this."</p> <p>She smiled and said, "You know that I have never felt so alive before. The day we married is going to be hard. We will be together forever, but that's the thing, I love you more just as much as I love you. And you love me so much that you don't want to lose me. I love you even more for that than you ever didâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
