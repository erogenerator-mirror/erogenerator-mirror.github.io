There she had been for the whole day, aching to be in that place again. With a smile that was almost scary, she got out of the bed and dressed hurriedly for the drive home. She did so just in case the police took her to a hospital or something. The only thing she had to add to that was that she had actually spent some of the day taking a shower, just in case the police got around to taking her home before her sister's car had driven off.</p> <p>The drive of the block to home was quiet, except for the ticking of her mother's clock. The one she heard on her bed that made her laugh was the one next to the door. The clock on the wall read 6:05. She had to get in, no matter what the outcome would be. As she slowly opened the door and entered her bedroom, the light of the lamp illuminated her with a soft glow.</p> <p>Kira reached under the covers and pulled her panties off, exposing her cleanly shaved body. She removed her bra, laying the underwear on the bed behind her. A thin strip of her hair peeked through the slits in the corner of her night gown.</p> <p>The feeling of freedom she had was completely unexpected. Having one foot resting against the bedpost, she quickly slipped under the covers with her panties on. Her body slowly came out of the darkness as the light crept across her bare flesh. She felt the warm air on her breasts as they were enveloped in a sheet.</p> <p>Kira turned over slowly, laying back. Her body was still covered and she felt a little embarrassed and yet at peace at being this way.</p> <p>"Oh no, you said the answer was "no"," she thought to herself. She closed her eyes and felt the softness of the sheet across her head. She could feel herself falling deeper as the soft folds of the sheet began to slip over the soft skin of her shoulders and the sides of her breasts. She felt a slight dampness against the top of her stomach.</p> <p>Kira was now laying on her side, her legs still folded under her, covering her head from each direction. She felt a slight shift in her body but still felt no pain at all. This was her time to wake up.</p> <p>She knew that she had always been afraid of the fear of waking up from the world in the daylight and knew that her only comfort could be lying next to it. Her thoughts were still on the fact that the night before had been a dream, a fantasy. When the events had unfolded, she knew her fear of waking up to something so unfamiliar and yet so intense.</p> <p>She also knew that the memories, of those scenes, were real. They were real. The dream was real. The dream was real. It was just a moment and she could not, could not stop it from becoming real. She knew what it would look like once it was her that became the reality.</p> <p>Sudden awareness of her situation dawned on her, she was not completely out of bed. As she looked down, she was surprised at how her hands would be. She could feel her breasts as she let her fingers slide across the top of her breasts, down across her breasts, and back up again, across her stomach. Her hands were still over her left tit as she continued to feel her body.</p> <p>She heard the click of her door opening and was startled at the sound of the door being opened and closed again. Her hand was now resting in the small of her back, covering the small of her back in a way that would allow it to slide easily against the fabric. The sensation was the same as it had been when her hands were covering her back.</p> <p>She heard the soft footsteps of her sister as she walked into the bedroom. "Are you alright?" she heard her sister ask as she looked at her sister.</p> <p>They were on top of each other, standing in their doorway just barely touching the bottom. She could not see what the "other" part was exactly. It was probably only a foot in height and her sister was standing right next to it with the very top of her hand resting on the small portion of her lower back under her arm, directly across her ass, that ran from her chest down onto her pelvis. She could not see it like it was her other leg with the rest of the hand just resting in the top of her ass. She could not help but notice it was not one thin piece of cloth that her sister was wearing. The top of her ass was slightly parted between her legs as was just the tiniest of hairs across the bottom of her ass. Her lower back was only slightly higher than the top of her legs, and she did not feel her sister's breasts pressed togetherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
