Sam asked in surprise.</p> <p>"Nothing." Emma smiled.</p> <p>'Well maybe it didn't go away in the end, but I know it didn't go away either.' Sam thought.</p> <p>'Probably the least I could do was apologise to you.' Emma smiled.</p> <p>'Please don't.' Sam didn't want to. 'You should know, I was so close to cumming.'</p> <p>"I have to admit." Emma laughed again. "You are getting on my nerves."</p> <p>'Don't worry, this will do.' Sam said. "Please let me cum."</p> <p>"How do you want me to do this?' Emma asked.</p> <p>Sam got the idea in a flash and pulled her face down onto his cock, tasting every last little inch that could be contained in his cock. She wrapped her lips around his cock and sucked on him while she slowly stroked herself. Sam leaned back, enjoying this new experience, and opened his eyes to let out a low moan just as he felt his cum boil up inside him. "Yes." He managed. 'God, that feels good'." 'Yes?" Samantha said with a little more enthusiasm than she usually did.</p> <p>"Yes. Oh God yes."</p> <p>They lay beside each other for a length of time, enjoying the feeling of the other's body heat. They continued to kiss, enjoying the taste of each others' body. It was always a good idea to make the other think about her and to let her know she was in control. The feeling of a penis in your mouth, the smell of a woman after you have been with them, it was the most intimate thing one can do.</p> <p>When they eventually fell asleep, Sam spooned up against Emma and lay there looking her in the eye.</p> <p>"Thank you." She said quietly, giving Sam a kiss. "For everything."</p> <p>Sam couldn't help but wonder what the future would bring, she was always with him now she was with him now. And if she got a job, or whether she was invited in to spend the night with him on their yacht in the cold of a rainy night, it would definitely be good news for her.</p> <p>-End-â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
