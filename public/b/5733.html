That, my husband said, was it, my only choice would be to wear a thong, or on my legs, or a skirt, and I sure as hell didn't want a skirt. My pussy was bare, and I was so out of place there in this awkward position.</p> <p>"So, do I have a chance of finding out who's in the house, or on my own?"</p> <p>"Let me see if I'm talking to you," she said.</p> <p>She'd picked me up in the parking lot, and I sat on the curb wearing a skirt, and looking silly, but this woman was all I thought about.</p> <p>"Do you look like yourself yet?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes, I am," I said.</p> <p>She laughed. "You're not alone."</p> <p>"So, who's on the house? Is it a girl, the man? Oh, my," I said, and got up.</p> <p>She took one look at my legs exposed by my skirt, and I'm sure she saw my pussy, all pink folds of skin.</p> <p>"I'm with a real, real man. My man, he's been around this long. My man knows what we do, he's had everything you could give him. It's all about you."</p> <p>"That's not true," I said.</p> <p>"What's true is when she's with a real woman, no, a woman, it's her ass we're talking about."</p> <p>"Is she gay, or maybe a lesbian?"</p> <p>"Of course she is, and I'm no lesbian, but she's a real, really hot babe, and she's like, super special. She's got big, round, perfect tits. She's got all those natural red hair, and her hair's all different, different and different. It's all a big deal with men. I like guys."</p> <p>"Well I like you like she does, though I don't think I like her at all," I said, and she just looked at me. "Do you do this all the time?"</p> <p>"Mwhaaaaa" she said, and started walking towards me. "You're a smart, and you have all that intelligence, your own sense of humor." she said, and stopped at my legs, and looked at my pussy. "I can get on my knees and do anything you want, if you like."</p> <p>"Oh, you know I think you're gorgeous when you're beautiful," said a voice in the back of my mind.</p> <p>I looked up, and there was a man with a mustache and goatee and a beard, standing in front of me. I'm going to be sick, I think.</p> <p>She had a look of shock on her face as she looked at me, as if she was shocked at what she saw there and said.</p> <p>"I mean, how do you know?" I said, as if I was shocked at what I was going to do, but I didn't.</p> <p>"I've known you longer than you knew me. You had to get a lot of good looks in your life. I told you that you really do turn me on. You're a man, and you can see pretty clearly what a woman looks like."</p> <p>He was a couple inches taller than me, and looked a bit like a movie director. I stood there shaking in fear, and she said, "You've got to watch. You don't have to even think about it. She's got the perfect body. She's got the right muscles, the right face. But if you don't, you're gonna get a lot on your face. She's your wife, you're gonna stare at her all day. And that's what's gonna happen. She'll get to see your face and maybe feel what kind of a woman a woman can be."</p> <p>She was so convincing, and I think she figured out how to seduce me. I looked at the man standing in front of me, and I thought about what he looked like, and I thought about it. Here I was with a woman who actually looked like she wanted and loved me and had a man look at me. I felt sick, and I didn't want this. But maybe if I just sat through this whole thing, I could stop shaking.</p> <p>He was taller, about five feet seven inches, with short, dark hair and hazel eyes mixed up in with the rest of his dark hair. It looked so familiar, and I knew he felt the same way. He looked familiarâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
