I had brought a fresh change of clothes, and I took my shirt off, and hung it in a closet up there.</p> <p>I turned the corner and the light was on and suddenly the room was dark. But I felt the weight of a big set of feet on the sheets, and my own. Looking closer I saw one naked, well developed, muscular little body atop the firm, supple ass of this cute, little black girl. It was not her at all. The girl was wearing a black, buttoned back dress that looked like it had been painted on, and it stopped just short of what I guessed was a large pair of breasts hiding a pair of very large, round, pale, brown, pale pink nipples. She was not wearing any panties and she was bald down below! One hand was at the crotch, and her middle finger was going up and down over the entire area of her pussy!</p> <p>I watched her for a few minutes, mesmerized by her movements. Then I looked through one of the drawers in my night stand, found a pair of very soft, shiny, well cared for black satin panties, and put them up to her face. She gave a short, deep moan and pushed them into her mouth. As I took them off, she opened her eyes and gave me a sexy smile!</p> <p>"You like that, don't you?," she asked me, her head moving back and forth slightly as her eyes closed.</p> <p>I walked over to her and she turned my face up toward hers. This time I put her hands around my waist and she placed them down onto my stomach. She began to slowly rub her fingers along my sides and lower abdomen as she looked deeply into my eyes. Her eyes looked down at my cock as she got closer.</p> <p>"Is it what you dreamed it would be?" she whispered in my ear as she began to trace her fingers along my inner thighs and slowly lower my balls. I could feel myself getting incredibly hard as she cupped and fondled me, her head going back and forth slightly as her hand massaged my balls.</p> <p>I watched her beautiful face, her lips moving slightly, but not meeting mine, as her fingers teased my shaft. She rubbed me faster and harder as her tongue went into my ear.</p> <p>"I told you I had to teach you, so here's why...," she said as she moved her head down in a teasing, circular motion. I felt myself growing in her hand as she began to massage me up and down, and my cock began to swell in her hand. In just moments the pre cum began to leak onto her palm and fingers as her head moved down towards me. Her tongue darted out and licked up my shaft and to my balls. "MMMM," she sighed as she began to lick and suck me with a slow, long, deliberate motion. She seemed to enjoy her first taste of me, and after a few minutes she asked me to lay down on my back on her bed. I turned and lay down and she smiled sweetly at me and lay down on me kissing me and rubbing herself on my body, running her finger against mine, as she kissed me once more.</p> <p>I felt her hips grind into me as she continued to kiss me. They moved together just a tiny bit as she kissed me. She moved her leg so she could push against me, and I felt her wetness.</p> <p>"Do you want me in you?" she asked me. I nodded against her lips, and she kissed me. We remained silent until she broke away, and I realized that she was crying as she got off me.</p> <p>"Baby," she said into my ears, "I love you. I have loved you from that first moment of our first meeting. I have loved you since then. If it doesn't feel so good, do it again. I'm very tired tomorrow night, and then we will have a wonderful time."</p> <p>I kissed her lips, and we lay talking for about an hour while we kissed passionately. Then I got up, and took off the wedding ring that she wanted to wear for the night. She looked back at me as I walked over to the mirror, and noticed it was the one she had made, and said, "I wore that to say 'Welcome to the family', that's for sure". She got up and put the ring out on a chain around her neck, and she put her arms around my neck and hugged me. "That was beautiful, and it's for you," I whispered back to her.</p> <p>She then looked at me in the mirror for a minute, and finally said, "How can I ever thank you for your honesty. You make this day perfect.
