A more gentle version of that had just gone through. But the rest of her life was a nightmare.</p> <p>'How old are you, by the way?'</p> <p>She stopped and started to answer the question, but he was quick to answer, asking her, 'I'm sixteen. Did you know that?'</p> <p>'Well, I've no idea when I last saw you, but I remember your clothes and what you were wearing last night, even if I don't think you had it on when you left,' She blushed and grinned, 'did you have someone else in your life?'</p> <p>'No. Of course not. When did you go?'</p> <p>'I came along a month ago. Just before I was supposed to. I only have to look in to see who I'll be seeing and I don't care. It was fun. You were on the phone every night, asking if I was coming home every night, asking for a ride on a private bicycle. I was so turned on and happy when I left the city.</p> <p>'And you always looked back at me. You knew that, and you were always smiling. And I'm not even in the right frame of mind to remember what made me smile the best, so I don't get into that much details. I don't really know much of a time period, but that's the best time of the year, so that's the last time I'll ever worry about what you do when you're not seeing you.</p> <p>'And even now you are in the right frame of mind,' She was nodding her head, 'now, because you're doing everything you ever hoped to do with me. I think you've found who you really are today, and if only all my life could make you happy and you could spend your life with me. Just go with the flow.'</p> <p>He smiled, and nodded, 'If you think I'll ever take off, I might be glad to join your new house, and you could be my guide when I'm working.'</p> <p>'Maybe,' she grinned after a pause, 'you're not going to join that club are you?'</p> <p>He laughed, 'I'm going to tell him that I'm just leaving town and don't even own this place. But in my opinion, it'll be an interesting week.'</p> <p>She smiled at him, and he was smiling when she finished her sentence. They sat in front of the TV, laughing, and she started to watch some news. The oldies weren't that bad, but what had she been so excited?</p> <p>This man was so smart, and so smart. She'd like to see him with her every day. She'd want to know more than just about every hour.</p> <p>But she couldn't just ask. She must try.</p> <p>She started to tell him about it every day, and in the evenings they watched movies together, sometimes in each others' company. Then a few times, and she was so glad to have the company, she let him see her without the usual mask, just this quiet sexy grin.</p> <p>He went to the bathroom often, and she had to use the sink every time. He was so thoughtful, and she felt he didn't mind talking about anything, because he did talk a lot. It was hard to tell that he was the most loving, loving man she ever had the chance to know, but she really didn't need to be told.</p> <p>She was right though. He was so attentive, telling her everything she needed to know. He was an oldie when it came to talking about a girl's day, but he was not a fool. She could tell that in all his years of thinking, he was only eighteen. If that was how that looked, then she would have to have had to put up with him for years, before the night was over.</p> <p>Even with his birthday last week, she was wondering if she might get a chance to know him even a few more times, and perhaps he could share this with her again, before the week was over.</p> <p>When she had the chance, she'd try to give it a try. But she was surprised. She really didn't know if he was up for that again, but perhaps he did not object to her dating him again, or rather would rather talk this out.</p> <p>On the other hand, she was always more excited about meeting him, and she had always wanted to spend more time with him.</p> <p>She knew that she wanted lots of good time with him, and she wanted to see him as much as she could.</p> <p>She hadn't quite got her whole life planned out but had always had a plan, and theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
