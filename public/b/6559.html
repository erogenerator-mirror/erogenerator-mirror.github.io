Mike murmured. Then he turned to Jessica and asked, "When did you get so damn lucky, honey?"</p> <p>"You've got a hardon right now, aren't you?" She grinned wickedly at him.</p> <p>"God, yeah, but what's this?" Rick asked.</p> <p>Jessica held both hands over his erection in her one hand and caressed his face with the other. "You've got a hardon and haven't even asked me..." she said seductively.</p> <p>"You don't have to..." Rick stammered. It was the first time in four years that he'd ever heard his voice use another word.</p> <p>Jessica giggled. "I know you don't love me, Mike. But I don't care. You can't just walk away without putting yourself out there. You have to put yourself out there. For someone as young and vibrant as you." Jessica said softly.</p> <p>Rick looked at her, then at Jessica. "It's not that I don't love you. I love you. For whatever reason." he managed. He looked at the rest of the room wondering, what could possibly have made her so happy? Her words seemed to put her at ease. That was what it was. It was all a game to her. She'd tease him, tease him, and he was helpless to her.</p> <p>Rick looked back at her as she turned and leaned against him. She held one arm over his and the other reached down and started to rub at his balls. "I want to eat your pussy, Mike. It really turns me on when you say that." she said as she looked into his eyes. As she spoke, she slid a finger under the waist of his boxer briefs and began to tug at them. His erection strained to escape from the confinement and he felt something he hadn't felt in a long time... a soft touch on his cock.</p> <p>"Ah... Jessica..." he groaned as she rubbed him. He didn't want to go there. He didn't want to make her feel like that... he didn't know where it got them this way. "Don't!" he gasped.</p> <p>Jessica grinned broadly. "Don't worry about it. It'll get hard soon, baby. It'll be an easy fix." She leaned to kiss his cheek. "Just hold still." she said softly. "I'll do it for you in a moment." She said as she began to gently tug at his briefs. She kept pulling at the waist of his briefs, her finger teasing him as it worked it's way around his hardness. After a few moments of holding his cock in her hand, she pulled them away. "Ah... that's better," she whispered.</p> <p>"It's been long enough." Mike said as he grabbed at her hand.</p> <p>Jessica giggled. "Do you really think so? I've been meaning to ask you this same thing before, but I was afraid not to." Jessica's eyes closed as she leaned forward. "I just don't think it'll go away with... well, anything." She looked up at him. "I'm sorry I never told you... but even then, you're a sweet guy." She said as her hand moved under his boxer briefs. She began to slide them down his legs. As she stood up to do so, she leaned to kiss his chest. "Maybe the reason you're so reluctant to give one of your buddies a handjob after you've gone back to a dead man was because of me."</p> <p>Moe laughed and said, "I don't think I've ever heard Jessica mention one of your friends."</p> <p>"That's because he's still got a cock. And, as I said earlier, he's a lot nicer than your husband" she said in a mock pout. Jessica's hand felt good along with Mike's cock. She knew what she was doing would certainly turn on Mike. She smiled as she looked up at Rick. "Besides?" she said. "I'd love to suck on one, too."</p> <p>Mike grinned. "Just wait until Jessica gets a mouthful of your dick... I bet I can fit it in like this." he grinned as she continued to work his cock. "Oh, Mike..." Jessica said as she stopped stroking with her left hand. "No more cock for me... or your. But only because it looks so damn good... why don't we give it a try?" she said. She pulled his briefs down around his ankles then turned and smiled at Mike.</p> <p>"You do it?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes." she nodded at him. "I would love to suck on you and see you cum. When you're ready to, I'll do that for you, too." she said as she movedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
