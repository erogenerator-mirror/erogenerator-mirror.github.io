As they entered the dimly lit and decorated room, she stopped him and said, "Wait right there. I want to try something very special, and I don't quite know why."</p> <p>"What do you think, Baby?" Toni asked.</p> <p>"Honey, what did you just suggest?'</p> <p>"Just what I think would make our Honeymoon special," she said, smiling.</p> <p>She took his hand and led him to the large mirror on the other side of his door. When they got to the spot in front of the mirror, she held his hand out and pulled the hem and off his dress. As the two of them walked naked through his hallway, Toni looked at him; and she was surprised to see that he was fully erect and pointing straight out at her. She pulled him to her and they embraced. They locked lips in the most passionate kiss this young man had ever experienced. His hands roved the warm flesh of her naked back under her dress and she stroked his hard cock through his pants. Their lips and tongues explored each other's mouths, savoring the taste of their kissing.</p> <p>Toni pushed him on the bed and her mouth and tongue found its way back to his cock through his pants. She gently squeezed his balls in her hands as she sucked first one, then, then two fingers deep into her hot moist pussy. She rolled her hips against her fingers, which drove him wild.</p> <p>He reached down her silk teddy and pulled the lacy white bra cups to the side, exposing her large areola and nipples to his tongue. She moaned loudly as he flicked his tongue over her nub and teased it toward the center of her chest. Toni grabbed his head and pulled it toward her breast and he swirled his tongue around her engorged nipple. He sucked on it and flicked it with his tongue, flicking it all the way from the top, back and forth, making her crazy with desire.</p> <p>Toni felt her climax approaching and with one last thrust of her hips, she climaxed for him, as his tongue found its way to the other nipple. He gently sucked on both nipples at once, feeling the hard nubs of her mounds against his mouth. She loved every minute of his sucking and her body felt like aflame with desire.</p> <p>"Oh, God, Baby. Baby. Oh, Baby. I can't stand it any longer," she yelled as she started to climax again.</p> <p>"I love you, Sweetheart," he mumbled between sucking as her orgasm ripped through her.</p> <p>Toni was in heaven; her eyes were rolling back as she ground herself even more against his fevered mouth. Toni kept sucking and tonguing his neck as she approached another orgasm, just as she started to cum yet again. She finally released him from her mouth and sucked on his lips and cheeks as her body trembled in ecstasy.</p> <p>She smiled down at him and said, "Oh, God, I needed that. I really needed that."</p> <p>"Honey, that was amazing. I haven't ever felt anything like that before. Do you want to try it again?"</p> <p>"Are you sure you've never enjoyed oral before, Honey?"</p> <p>"If you really really liked what that special mouth on your neck did to you last night, I would love to try this again."</p> <p>"And I'm certainly willing to try it," Toni said with a grin.</p> <p>"All right, if you absolutely don't mind, you can go back to your room, get your panties and teddy off, and put the little thong on now."</p> <p>Toni watched him as he took his clothes off, looking around the room in case he hadn't gotten the chance to do anything with it as they planned it. He was wearing a skimpy pair of silk boxers under a robe and then quickly pulled them on. He noticed that she had changed into her thong and a very light green tank top which accented her lovely breasts.</p> <p>"Wow, Honey, your titties are so nice and round. I love the way your nipples stand out."</p> <p>"I'm glad you like them, Honey."</p> <p>They kissed again and he pulled the negligee back over her head and buttoned up around her neck. Then they both stood up and she put her arms around his shoulder and kissed him again, then they turned to go back down the hall and she opened the door and let him pass first. As he passed another door he glanced out and saw that they were the third hallway leading down the hall. They left the door open and he could see the glow of the lamp being adjusted to the night time light.</p> <p>When they reached the next door, Toni turned around and held out her hand to the knob.
