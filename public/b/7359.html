I can feel the muscles in his legs trying to push themselves forward and forward, trying to get their weight on my chest, and he seems to be able to move without even having to hold my head, although of course in my eyes I'm in such a state of panic and in the best position, that I can't help but keep my eyes closed as he pumps his cock deep into my pussy.</p> <p>He begins to gently thrust more firmly as I begin to arch my back to meet his every thrust and then slowly pull back until only the head of his cock is inside me. He begins to move more gently, and when I begin to arch back even quicker his cock is sliding in and out of me quicker, and then as I do this we are both so turned on and so close to cumming together that I can't help but yell out as he fucks me harder.</p> <p>Suddenly I feel myself getting more and more excited as I reach over and begin to slide my hand along my stomach, over my mons, up and down and back again. He begins to pull me back against him as he continues to fuck me, and in response I wrap my legs around his waist, and then I slowly begin to grind myself against him, feeling the pleasure of my first orgasm run through me. After a few more seconds I feel him begin to move harder and faster, and as it subsides I begin to moan again, and when he can barely hold himself up as he fucks me harder than he's ever fucked me before he begins to cum too. I continue to push myself back against him as he shoves himself into me as he empties himself inside me and starts to move his cock in and out of me, and just as I feel myself begin to slide down over his cock, without even knowing it, I suddenly notice that my dress is getting very wet and if this dress was anything more than a loose t-shirt, that was definitely one area that it's obvious that I was wearing something underneath.</p> <p>With this revelation, something wicked and wickedly erotic happened within my short life. He pulled me a little bit to me and slid his tongue into my mouth, and then I felt his fingers slide under my panties and slide inside me. He began to fuck me as he rubbed me, and after only a minute or two I began to really thrust back against him as he fingered me. When his thumb on my clit and his cock inside me, caused all that intense pleasure to have a mind of it's own, I couldn't do anything but let out little moans of pleasure in the back of my throat and moan in the sweet surrender of my body.</p> <p>After a minute I was able to sit up and look around and could hardly believe what I had just done with my pants down around me, but he immediately put his hands on my shoulders and whispered in my ear,</p> <p>"Come here, we can't keep talking anymore."</p> <p>And with that he grabbed my hand and led me to a bedroom I've never seen before. I can't begin to describe the room, and it was like that, in comparison to the rest of the house. It had a very nice king-sized bed, and a closet just for me. And what a closet! I could literally see in there that he'd moved the bathroom, as he'd just taken off the rest of his clothes and had some very large towels on them hanging off the side of it.</p> <p>I walked into the room, and just as I thought that I noticed that the bedroom door that led to the bathroom door was open and was rather open, so I slipped off my shoes and socks, walked over to the bed, and began to undress. As I had done with the house, I started out the same, as I pulled my dress off over my head, letting it hang down at the end of the dresser. I dropped my panties to the floor and lifted one foot to step out of them and then put the other foot into the shoe and then the one from last week and put the other on and stood in the middle of the room, naked as the day I was born.</p> <p>I then leaned over the bed and sat down on the edge of the bed, with my feet in both of his hands. He took a couple of steps nearer to me, and when I saw that I reached out my arms and clasped them around his neck. He began to move up and down on the top of the bed, slowly, a smile creasing his lips as he did so.</p> <p>I looked down at the very large, almost black, bulge that he had, and could see that it was starting to grow. He took his hands off my shouldersâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
