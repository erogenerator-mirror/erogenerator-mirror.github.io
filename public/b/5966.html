She looked at him almost lovingly, like she was saying no, as if he were an old man to a young girl. He didn't understand, why she wouldn't go down on him, but he couldn't see her looking away from him like this. He felt his legs start to shake and he closed his eyes and relaxed, enjoying the feel of her lips on his cock. She kept sucking him and stroking him, slowly, carefully, slowly. She kept stroking his cock with her hand, and then just as slowly she pulled her fingers away and looked up at him.</p> <p>"Are you ready to cum now?" She asked him breathlessly.</p> <p>"Yes! Oh God Yes!" He said as his cock exploded, hard, and shooting off in her mouth. It didn't bother him as much as he thought it might. He was pretty sure that she hadn't expected to cum so quick, just as he had expected. He had never told her that he was usually so eager to cum and she wouldn't have believed it. Her lips seemed to be making him hot again. She kept sucking him for a minute, until his cock finally began to go slack and soften. She stood up and looked down at him with her big green eyes.</p> <p>"It's always been yours, don't stop. Don't ever stop." She said with a grin then stood up again. She leaned over and kissed him on the cheek. He was still catching his breath, so she got up and kissed him softly on the lips.</p> <p>"Thank you, thank you, thank you so much." She said and kissed him again, even longer this time.</p> <p>"You're welcome." He said and kissed her again, this time a little more passionately. He felt her tongue in his mouth and they shared it for a minute, just enjoying the feel, smell, taste of each other before it passed away.</p> <p>"I'm going to go take a shower, or should I say, I'm going to take a quick shower and grab some breakfast?" She asked him.</p> <p>"Well, as you can guess, I'll go with you." He replied, his cock still hard inside her and he loved watching her move to the bathroom.</p> <p>"Don't forget the clothes for your swim." She said as he walked past her to the door.</p> <p>"Oh, yes of course, I'll get them." He said and followed her into the shower. There was a little fog in the air, like rain drops coming off the ocean and she could see her reflection standing in the doorway of the shower, water dripping down her naked body.</p> <p>He closed the door and started the water then washed it thoroughly, paying special attention to her breasts and her pussy. She washed herself completely, as if making a show to her man and he didn't seem to mind. While she washed, he washed himself using a separate washcloth from the shower. When he was finished, he put the cloth to his face and inhaled deeply of her perfume.</p> <p>"I love that smell." He said and ran one finger along her pussy lips before stepping into the shower with her. He put one soft hand on top of hers as he rubbed her pussy gently with his fingers. He loved the feel of her hairless pussy, so soft and warm.</p> <p>"Thank you." He said and kissed her once on the lips. "I just can't get enough of you. We'll do it again."</p> <p>"We'll only be going out another time, it's okay." She said and kissed him hard on the lips.</p> <p>"I'm hungry too." She added and he watched her walking down the kitchen. He got dressed and followed her as she went to the door.</p> <p>"You don't look very nice." He said and felt very silly.</p> <p>"Why do you feel like this? I'm the one who's dressed, so I thought that your suit was going to look pretty bad." She said.</p> <p>"The hell it will. Why don't we have pizza again?" He offered and she agreed. There were a lot of people in the pizza joint and the conversation drifted to her wearing that outfit. He asked if she had a friend or was she an old woman. She had a friend, though. As soon as they were leaving the restaurant, she excused herself.</p> <p>"I guess I should have come with." She said. "I wouldn't have missed this place for the world if you hadn't dropped in when you did."</p> <p>"That's sweet. Do you remember the last time you were here?" He asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, well the owner died and I had to work the rest of the shift. It was nice." She said as a matter of fact. It took her a lot of time to get herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
