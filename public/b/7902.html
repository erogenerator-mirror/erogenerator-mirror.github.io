"She did a good job. She is looking forward to meeting you."</p> <p>The other guy got to his feet. "She really looks forward to meeting you too. Your company is fantastic. I have to give her a call before I get back."</p> <p>"I'll let her call me," I answered. I walked out of the store and walked back into Joe's. He was standing there looking a lot like he owned it. He looked at me.</p> <p>"I'll take that as a yes. Thanks. I'll see her tonight." He turned and walked away. I followed him a bit when the sign up waiter brought our order. I ordered the chicken and vegetables. The waiter looked at me again and said, "How is your day going?"</p> <p>"Oh okay," I answered. "It's been busy."</p> <p>"So do you think you might have a chance with her?"</p> <p>"Whoa," I replied. "How do you feel about this?"</p> <p>"I haven't really thought about it. We just met. It was like an old friend."</p> <p>"Good for her. But the last thing she wants me for is another guy."</p> <p>"You have to be a gentleman to do that."</p> <p>"Thanks," he said. He returned to take us back to our table. The conversation was light and the waiter returned with our meal. I took a sip of my coffee and told him, "Your company is so good. I might run home in a half hour. If you're not busy, call me." He smiled and nodded.</p> <p>I felt I had already made up my mind about to see him that evening. I was still a little apprehensive about seeing him, but knew that was a possibility. And he had already agreed to meet with me that night. Why not? "I'll be available," I answered when he got the chance. I sat up at the edge of my chair and stretched my legs out.</p> <p>"You're really looking forward to meeting her tonight," he said.</p> <p>"You've already been. She's already meeting me. And we're going to have a great time!"</p> <p>I leaned out at the same time I stretched. He looked from me to the other table to me. "It's been great!"</p> <p>"It was wonderful!" I said. "Are you ready for more adventure tomorrow?"</p> <p>"I guess so," he replied. "Maybe." He finished his food, smiled at me and went back to the rest room.</p> <p>"Where are you heading? Are you going to drive back?"</p> <p>"I was thinking about going to a movie, maybe go to a bar, do some wine, and just drive home."</p> <p>"You want to do that?" he asked, "You haven't done that much of anything. Do you like the way I know you do and what you do, I mean?"</p> <p>"I think I'm starting to see a lot of those things, but I'm not sure. I was kind of looking forward to it. Let's go for a drive tomorrow."</p> <p>We finished our last bite of food and Joe kissed me on the cheek before he left. "I'll call you as soon as I get back," he said.</p> <p>I walked out to my car with a huge smile on my face and headed home. As I drove across the street to my condo, my mind drifted back to the night I met this guy. Why that man can make me crazy. He had already met with me. And maybe I should just go all out with him. Then I couldn't wait to meet him tomorrow.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>I picked up a note to call on my cell. "Hello. Yes, there's another woman to meet you tomorrow. Yes, she is looking forward to hearing from you." There was a ring on my phone from two days ago and I thought it was good news but I didn't want to wait until tomorrow. After a long week away from the work I'd been doing for the last six months, I just never felt like I have any time at the office, so I decided to give this a try.</p> <p>I arrived at Joe's condo and rang the doorbell. I was standing a little in front of the door when I heard two voices say, "Hello!"</p> <p>The second voice answered, "Yes, it's me. I answered my door this morning. I'm coming with you."</p> <p>I'm not sure what was happening. We don't communicate but I can definitely hear him talking to other voices and I can alsoâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
