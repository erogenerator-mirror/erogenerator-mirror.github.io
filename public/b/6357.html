Her attention was drawn to the man sitting there looking at her with a grin on his face. His eyes were sparkling as he looked at her.</p> <p>"Do you need a chair?" He asked as he smiled.</p> <p>"Not for a while," she answered, "Thank you. I'll try to remember to thank you before we go home."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sure you'll do that."</p> <p>She smiled at him, and he raised his eyebrows.</p> <p>"What happened to your friend, Jack, I mean, how did he get into you for such a long time?"</p> <p>"He told me, in case I didn't tell you about him," she answered. "He doesn't have a family member living with him; I'd have to trust him. I don't know if this was what he would do if I didn't."</p> <p>"Well, I'm impressed. And maybe I'll think about asking you about it after all," Sam said, "but not right now. It would be hard to know about that."</p> <p>"I'll think about it," she said as she rose and followed him out the door.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>Sam sat alone with a couple of beers, drinking an amber coke that he had for dinner. It was just about time to leave. He'd just finished his meal when his phone rang.</p> <p>He looked over to see his daughter Elizabeth watching him out the door.</p> <p>"Do you want to come in for dinner, Jack?" she asked.</p> <p>"Sounds good," he answered, "But I'm not sure how long we'll have. Is Sam really still in bed tonight?"</p> <p>"You have no idea," she answered, "and I have a feeling you won't either. But you've had quite a night," as she smiled at him.</p> <p>"Yeah, about that," she said as she watched him walk into the kitchen. "You're looking good."</p> <p>She felt her cheeks flush as she watched his strong arms flex as he moved, and he'd put her mind at ease so well.</p> <p>Her head hung down in confusion as he disappeared into the bathroom.</p> <p>She couldn't help but smile as she heard the shower start.</p> <p>Sam's wife Elizabeth was one of those who were not in the mood to deal with the "bribe" from those of their group. And she didn't expect him to turn the shower all the way down.</p> <p>Instead, she was just about to step over and give him a hug when she heard the back door open.</p> <p>She couldn't see past the corner of her eye, but a naked man was walking toward her. She recognized his voice though, and couldn't help but smile as she saw him standing just by the open door.</p> <p>"Is your father here?" she said, not even waiting for an answer.</p> <p>They were both silent as they stared at the naked man sitting on the toilet. She stood transfixed watching it.</p> <p>"It's so beautiful," he whispered.</p> <p>She felt her cheeks heat at the sound of his words, but then the man in the bathroom began to laugh. His face reddened as his breathing quickened.</p> <p>"It's so bad how it's always been, " he finally said as he stared at the naked man on the toilet.</p> <p>"It's hard to believe it," she said, "But you're looking good," as she moved back to the door to try out her husband's body as he smiled at her.</p> <p>"I knew it," he said as he turned and ran his hand down over her head, "But I think you should see a few of your friends before they come around."</p> <p>"Come on, let's go," she said as she watched him run out of the bathroom and turn the shower on.</p> <p>"We don't have to do anything," he said as he looked her up and down.</p> <p>"We shouldn't even think about it. Let's just go right here," she said as she walked toward the bathroom.</p> <p>Their eyes met as they embraced, and he could see all the thoughts in his mind in the depths of the dark room beyond. He'd never experienced anything like this before...a friend and a naked woman in a bathroom...and he was in a state of shock.</p> <p>And here she was.</p> <p>But she couldn't help but want to show him what he should have been going to for the past year. For years she couldn't.</p> <p>She didn't know what she felt, but she knewâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
