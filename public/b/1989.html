They walked slowly to the front of the tent.</p> <p>There was a large white tent set up in the middle of the camp, with tables set up on chairs that were covered with thick mats, and a large fire was burning.</p> <p>"Are you going to bring your own fire?" Mark said, surprised.</p> <p>"No, this is mine." He said, standing close, so that as he leaned forward, his head lay on his arm. "I want to sleep."</p> <p>"It's only a fire, but it'll feel better when you get up. You'll need your gear," he smiled. "They're always packed."</p> <p>Mark laughed. "Don't worry."</p> <p>"Good," he replied. He didn't even see the little tent they had laid on the grass.</p> <p>He waited in the tent for a while, taking his time with the meal in his mouth. As if to make sure what he would be doing, when he wasn't serving his meal, he opened the tent door and pulled a blanket out over them.</p> <p>"You need protection," he said, "I don't think they will allow it."</p> <p>"Well you can be safe. I have one in there," he added, handing him the blanket.</p> <p>He nodded. "Thank you," he whispered. He stretched out the blanket and went down the tent to turn on the small lantern, just one of those small lanterns.</p> <p>He came back to the tent, where he got comfortable.</p> <p>"You have a pretty big tent."</p> <p>"The only thing bigger than yours is a big tent. It's really just for sleeping on," he smiled.</p> <p>"If I can't have this," the girl said, holding out the blanket for himself, "I have to have this."</p> <p>"It seems to come in handy."</p> <p>He opened the tent window and they were looking out. It was pitch black, and they really only had one light in the tent. Mark went back to work on the blanket, and they looked out a bit to see if there was anything there.</p> <p>"I thought as much," the man said. "You want your own light first."</p> <p>The girl smiled. "I guess you could do that though."</p> <p>"You could?" Mark asked.</p> <p>The man nodded. "You could," he asked. "I could also go with you."</p> <p>The girl didn't even hesitate as she stood and began to undress. Mark watched, mesmerised, as the girl stripped off her nightgown and then began to undo the ties from the nightgown, freeing herself to lay down.</p> <p>Mark couldn't believe his eyes. The girl was standing next to him, a woman, naked, and he was staring at her. He couldn't get up straight away, but he could manage to turn sideways so that they could both look. He saw them looking at his hands, as he stared at the girl.</p> <p>Just as they got to the point where they were both completely naked, Mark stopped. "I'm not going to bother with clothes again, is this okay?" he asked.</p> <p>The girl smiled, "It's fine by me. But I was curious if you were interested in seeing me naked."</p> <p>The man nodded. "You can see everything," he smiled.</p> <p>Mark pulled one of the blankets over his body. They had a bit of a soft cushion covering them, and it would do.</p> <p>"We can go back inside," Mark said.</p> <p>"What? How?" Mark could tell that she didn't mean what he was thinking.</p> <p>"Well," the man said, "We have to be careful not to make any noises, or we'll leave."</p> <p>He shrugged his shoulders. "It does get a bit noisy sometimes."</p> <p>The girl smiled at him. "Well we have to wait."</p> <p>The man nodded, "Yeah, I guess there's no point in staying."</p> <p>They began to walk back, toward the tent.</p> <p>"Is this where we're going to lie down?" He asked.</p> <p>The man nodded. "I thought you might. There's a few more where that came from."</p> <p>"That's where you get them when you do go camping."</p> <p>"And do you do this with someone?"</p> <p>"No. You don't."</p> <p>"And what are they doing?" He smiled.</p> <p>"Nuh uh." Mark tried to shrug.</p> <p>"Well, if you'd like me to help you... I think it's in keeping with my way of getting things right."</p> <p>"You're not helpingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
