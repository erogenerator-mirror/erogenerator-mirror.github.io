His hand slid down to her asshole and massaged her clit as the other hand grabbed his swinging balls and started stroking his shaft.</p> <p>"Oh yess!" she moaned. "Oh, God, yes!"</p> <p>Mark groaned, thrusting his hips forward into the bed and driving her hand up and down his dick. He bent down and kissed her as his hand slid up and down her shaft faster and she moaned as she felt his lips caressing her swollen nipples.</p> <p>"Oh! Yes." she mumbled as she looked into his eyes as he continued to suck on her breast. "Oh! Oh! Oh!"</p> <p>Mark couldn't hold back any longer as the first wave hit him. He stiffened, pulling on her shoulder as his cum spurted into her hand and he groaned deeply as he spewed again and pushed his pelvis forward.</p> <p>Melissa fell forward against him, her breasts crushed against his hairy chest as she felt him filling her hand, and he groaned deeply.</p> <p>As Mark pulled out of the girl he had just been lustfully sucking on and she scrambled off of him.</p> <p>"What?" he questioned, staring up at her standing on the bed. "What have we done?" he mumbled, his breath still coming in short bursts.</p> <p>Melissa climbed on top of him once again, this time straddling his hips. "I want to be with you again," she softly whispered. "We've been together only a few weeks now."</p> <p>Mark didn't really have an answer as Melissa slipped her body up his, sliding his cock between her thighs with her hands and then leaning forward so that her lips met his.</p> <p>"I've been with a lot," she softly said, kissing him. "Now I want to be with you. I want us to do things with the other person that we shouldn't do. In fact, I think that may be the key to you having a real, authentic relationship with me. We can't do this without exploring it."</p> <p>Mark couldn't argue with her. Melissa wanted to live as the friend he'd known, and her needs demanded that he live with her as her lover. And she wanted to do this without having to explain her behavior to him.</p> <p>Mark just nodded and kissed her back. His hands ran over her back once again, feeling the firmness of her curves and the firm resilience to her skin, and he kissed Melissa while his hands slid over her firm buttcheeks and back. His tongue snaked into her mouth as she groaned her delight and he knew that she was right where he wanted her.</p> <p>He gently pushed her off him and she leaned back against him, her body still covered in goose bumps from his fingers and kissed him as a hand went to her vagina.</p> <p>"You have me," she husked, her voice shaky with arousal as her hips moved toward his penis.</p> <p>"I've wanted to and I'm glad you do now," he said, reaching down to caress her asscheeks while his other hand slid up her back to feel her full breasts, his thumbs flicking and pinching her nipples.</p> <p>"I'm gonna be sore tomorrow, but for you," she said seductively as she kissed him even harder and pushed her hips forward. He slid into her and began to thrust, his hips moving as he felt her legs wrap around his waist.</p> <p>Melissa didn't resist when Mark's hands slid down to her ass and began to pull her backward.</p> <p>"Oh! God!" she cried, her whole body shaking with the intensity of it all. Her mind, her body, her mind were all centered around this incredible, wonderful, wonderful thing, but all that mattered was that it wasn't Mark fucking another woman, but a woman doing what she loved—that was what mattered most, even if it might be wrong.</p> <p>Melissa felt another orgasm starting at the tip of her penis and her muscles began to convulse around it as she felt Mark start to move inside of her.</p> <p>He pressed her body back against the bed and his hips swiveled back and forth, his own cock pulsing in and out of her now as the heat deep in her body continued to build.</p> <p>"That's it! That's it! I'm getting close!" he murmured as his hips moved faster, his muscles tightening as long ropes of white semen shot into her. He kissed her deeply, his hands on her naked ass as he emptied himself into her warmth.</p> <p>They held each other, both of them gasping for breath as they came down from their incredible orgasms. Mark lay on the mattress next to Melissa, still inside of her, his hands—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
