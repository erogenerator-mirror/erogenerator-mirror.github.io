He had an old coat which looked very clean and smelled a bit like coffee and eggs. He was still dressed and the only thing missing was a hat. The only items that looked familiar were his hat and his socks, which were actually some old socks with some sort of a leather material on the edges. He walked back over to where he was before, still dressed in his jeans and a shirt. He opened his jacket and pulled on his boots and pulled them on as well. He stood there for a moment, looking at his image in the mirror and then he put on his socks, hat and boots.</p> <p>Kieran stood in the middle of the room looking at his image as he felt a sense of pride with them. A bit of sadness crossed it and he tried to think of anything that would convey the image of him.</p> <p>The only thing he could think of was "If I really have to wear this" but it seemed like he wanted to let go of the sadness of it all.</p> <p>Suddenly the door flew open and they heard her cry out, "Oh Christ Kieran, I'm going to be sick!"</p> <p>Kieran just froze, he had expected it but there was no getting past the pain. He turned his head to see that she was standing in front of the mirror looking at herself. He didn't know anything about what was really going on, but it looked as if she felt as though her heart was going to stop for a moment.</p> <p>"Is there another reason?" She looked as though she had been trying to figure out how to ask him a question, but Kieran knew he was far from that point.</p> <p>"I..." he hesitated, "...I wanted to ask you again."</p> <p>"What were you doing?" Kieran heard her speak, but he didn't hear her ask him a question this time.</p> <p>"Nothing. Just being able to breathe when I'm excited, feel my heart do that for me."</p> <p>Kieran didn't know what to say, he was trying to think if he heard her or not. He just looked at her in the mirror and could have smiled at the image of her he had seen in the mirror.</p> <p>"Kieran, I know what you were going to ask last time." She said now, without looking up at him. "Just because I was feeling that I should ask you about it, I don't have to ask you anything, is that it?"</p> <p>He just shrugged his shoulders and stood back and looked down at himself. He saw her look down at his pants and suddenly it hit him that Kieran just realized in his sleep that he was getting more aroused by the second. Kieran took that as a good reason to keep looking at him, even if he had always felt that way.</p> <p>"There is one thing you do that really gets me hard. Don't do anything that would cause I may even get an erection myself."</p> <p>To his surprise Kieran noticed that her eyes were down there and didn't seem to be focusing on him as much as he thought they would.</p> <p>"What you need Kieran, is to be ready now, because if you are, then you need to do as I say and do it right."</p> <p>He could see her face relax as she just looked up at him, giving a little nod. The first thing he noticed was the slight pang that came to it was just because she was thinking about something. He wanted to laugh and tell her to stop, but he just couldn't make himself do that.</p> <p>"So, my answer is this, if you're ready, then the next time we meet you must be."</p> <p>He tried to find a way to give her a chance to think it through, but he just couldn't. After all he was his old self just like she had always done. He wasn't sure where she was going with this one, but it was obvious that she was starting to get into his pants from the way she was looking at him.</p> <p>He walked back over to where he was before and turned to sit down, before he noticed that her eyes had disappeared through the mirror to him.</p> <p>"Well, I should probably be done and get back to doing what I'm supposed to do for a little while."</p> <p>She gave a smile and walked off towards the other side of the room, presumably to talk with her mother, that she would be too embarrassed. As they parted she called to him with her voice, "Come back then, you can't forget about me after this."</p> <p>"Of course I can, I'd like to talk to you a little more." Kieran felt his heart skip a beat hearing her call himself friend instead of his new self.</p> <p>"Ok, I'll be back right before then. I'll get into anything you want to share with me and let my mindâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
