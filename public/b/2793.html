Never really."</p> <p>"I can't wait much longer," I whispered, leaning against her. I slipped two fingers in her, feeling her body tremble as I pushed them a little deeper. I pressed lightly against her, feeling her quiver. "Is it OK to call it off after all?"</p> <p>"It feels fantastic. I'm so wet and hot, but I'm ready for whatever comes next." I felt her begin to moan as I rubbed harder against her. I felt her body tense up as she squirmed beneath me. I moved my fingers, pressing harder and deeper. She was very close. I thought about bringing her to orgasm.</p> <p>"Please give it to me," she gasped.</p> <p>"Are you sure? I'm not sure how long I can hold out."</p> <p>"I don't care! I just need some more! I can't hold on much longer!" I slipped my fingers out of her and took each of her wrists in my hands. I felt her body relax as I slowly slid down to kiss her belly. I could feel her hips begin to move, and her breath catch. I moved lower, kissing her navel, stopping to stroke the length of her thighs and kiss her hips. I leaned forward, kissed her lower belly, and then began to lick her thighs. As she moved to press back against me, I moved one hand to her breast and teased her nipple. Her groans grew louder and her hips rose off the bed.</p> <p>I slipped my tongue in between her legs and found her opening. Her hands flew to my head as she came in waves against my tongue. Her breathing came in shallow gasps as she felt my lips caress her. Her fingers found my hair and pulled my face into her as she screamed and came. My fingers explored inside of her as I tasted her pleasure. I knew if I continued the motion would prolong her climax, so I did. As her breathing returned to normal, I moved myself down her body. We shared the taste of her as we kissed passionately.</p> <p>"I need some more," she whimpered.</p> <p>"All the way?"</p> <p>"Yeah," she said breathlessly.</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"I'm ready but you...you've..." She stopped as she realized she wanted more.</p> <p>"I just needed a little more time."</p> <p>"All right," she said gently, pressing herself back so I knelt between her legs. She watched as I began to move. Her eyes were still wide and looking at me intently as I entered her with one long stroke. I felt her hands in my hair as I began to move. In that instant, she saw the look on my face and smiled.</p> <p>"It's OK to look." She said as I began to thrust again.</p> <p>It felt so good she couldn't believe it when the bed began to move against her. She spread her legs wider, inviting me deeper. I felt my own excitement growing with every thrust. She felt every throbbing pulse she had from my hard shaft, and began to tell me how good I was making her feel.</p> <p>"Yes, my darling baby. Ride my cock. It feels good."</p> <p>She was beginning to groan, but I kissed her while continuing to work myself in and out of her. As her orgasm began to subside, I began to kiss her neck. Her hands slid down to my back and she began to rub my chest, and me, like a cat as she pulled my arms together. Her hands slid lower still until they found my ass, and began again.</p> <p>"You better get some pillows for us," she whispered. "Don't want to keep you here." She smiled that knowing smile as my fingers found her clitoris and began to circle, gently until she began to cry out. She looked up at me with the sexiest smile as she climaxed into me. I wanted to kiss her and kiss her some more, but the feeling between us was too intense to go there. Finally she looked over my shoulder and said, "Stay and watch when it's finished. I want to feel you inside of me, moving inside of me, in and out like you're going down on me."</p> <p>"You're right. It's better to do it with out knowing what we're doing." I reached up and caressed her cheek.</p> <p>"I know. I love feeling you inside of me like this," she said.</p> <p>She slid to the side of the bed and we lay next to each other, holding each other tight. I felt her fingers begin to lightly caress my chest as I brushed my hand down her arm. I began to kiss her lips, trying to convey the feeling of love she held in her hands to me. I felt her hand slide down my stomach, then lower to my penisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
