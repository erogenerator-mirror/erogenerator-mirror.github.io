Her voice was barely audible, in a kind of desperation that was so alien it was deafening. "Please forgive my transgression!"</p> <p>"A little more convincing was I." I kissed her again, a sweet but firm thing...one I hadn't felt in ages. This time, when I reached up and pressed against her face, it was just a short kiss that got better. "Now, my sweet pet, let's show you just how much you mean to me."</p> <p>And with that, my tongue parted her lips and my fingers pushed her mouth open. My tongue slid in, as if I wanted to draw it. I felt a hand on my cheek and the lips of a wet mouth sucking my skin. I felt hands gripping my head and my hands pushing her face hard against my chest. My body pressed in against hers and her tongue slid along my collar bone. A warm hand moved to grasp my cock through my pants in a way I'd never felt before.</p> <p>"Oh..." Her lips were so soft against my skin that I was beginning to worry that my voice would come out raw in the face of this. But I couldn't stop kissing her. It was so easy to kiss her like this. Just a little taste. Her mouth would open and close over mine after the kiss ended with a slight nibble against my tongue. "Take your hands off...I want to see how long I can tease you." Her eyes sparkled with challenge and desire. "Is that clear? What can I do to make this better?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>I could feel her tongue dancing in my mouth as she struggled against me. "Very good, you little tramp." Her hands were running up and down my chest and in my lap...the rough of her skin against mine, as well as the smoothness, hardness, and heat of her body. Her breasts were against my body and I pressed against them, feeling the hardness against her. She started kissing my neck and biting my neck as she tried to move my own body down a little, and to get the rest of her body against mine, and as I moved to move my arms around her, she gasped and moaned against my skin.</p> <p>Then I was moving down and pulling on her hair hard, so that she was struggling, moaning, trying to pull me off. Her eyes were blazing but she wasn't succeeding very well. "Don't let go! Stay. Stay!" I growled and she shivered, her body shaking.</p> <p>"No," she hissed. "Not until you give me every command. I don't want this to end." That was the one thing that had always kept me sane during this time, her obedience, her acceptance of me, it was her trust. I felt bad because I should have felt bad, because I should have made her cry, but what kind of a person was she? But she was begging to be my sex for the first time in ages. "Let me go..."</p> <p>That was it. That was the one thing that she never gave herself to, the things she loved. "You'll regret it." I kissed her again, and she kissed me back. Her body writhed against me. One hand moved to the back of my head, gripping me in a way her fingers would have, if I had given her that final command. She pulled my fingers harder and bit on my lip, and looked so beautiful. "Take off your clothes."</p> <p>I was so afraid that she was going to stop me. This girl who's mouth, eyes, breath—it was so hard to keep me still. But her body was amazing against me. So soft. So beautiful. Her hands were trembling and it was so hard to just relax my lips from her. So beautiful. So full. So warm. So full. I wanted hers so much, but she didn't respond. Her eyes were locked on mine with determination. I'm sure she could see the conflict that was forming on my face.</p> <p>She lifted her leg and I quickly removed my hands from the back of her head, making it look as though I was stripping her. Her fingers were in my hair as I let the panties go. It seemed like an eternity before I finally pulled them off and let them fall to the floor. Her body was covered in a sheen of sweat, her skin glistening in the moonlight and her eyes wide and dilated with desire. Her hand was still in my hair and she held me in place. I'm not sure if it wasn't the strain of trying to be careful with my breath. Or the lack of self control. Whatever it was, I couldn't get close enough to her body to feel her skin burning heat. If she came, I had to hold her tighter to keep the rest of her from touching my skin. But it was her body I touched—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
