You ready?" he asked. He felt like crying but couldn't, as much this woman was about to take him by surprise from the start and not give him a chance to argue. He nodded and took his seat. He quickly watched her go and hoped when she came over he wouldn't be disappointed.</p> <p>When she came back she was wearing a long, very black leather coat that felt smooth to her skin and looked fantastic on her. She sat down on the couch to his left. She looked at him for a moment and smiled. He smiled back. It didn't take long before he could tell she was as excited as he was. They talked for a little while, but it didn't help with the rest of their plans. When they finished the second drink they sat down on the couch.</p> <p>She looked at him and smiled. "It's been awhile." She said before taking a big drag from her cigarette.</p> <p>"You too. I missed a lot of things, and I don't think this week will be any different or worse. Not really," he answered. "If it is any different, I would be all right."</p> <p>"I'm glad," she said as she took another sip of her drink. She didn't even smoke so she told him all the stories she had heard, the stuff that she had known or, even more, experienced. She was very open about telling him the things and that he would know. They spent the next half hour having a good time. The way they acted and the way they talked, he felt very comfortable with her. It was obvious that she knew some of his things. At one point he could smell her. It was hard to tell where she had put her cigarette but she was definitely there.</p> <p>They made plans for the next day and agreed to hang out. They spent a little over two hours at most in the back bedroom, watching some very great movies and trying to get to know each other as it happened. It wasn't that their sex life had improved at all, but they hadn't been in this position in almost a year or more. They knew it and neither one had done anything else at this point so they didn't mind waiting.</p> <p>They made another drink and sat in the living room together when the front door opened. It was her cousin. She immediately started walking toward them. "I'm glad you guys are having good time," she said in a loud voice. The both of them turned and started laughing.</p> <p>"Me too."</p> <p>"I haven't had even a third drink and haven't been drinking in ages," she replied.</p> <p>"Well, we have some things we're going to discuss," he said. "And you can go get her," he told her, gesturing toward the couch.</p> <p>"What? You want us to come watch you fuck my cousin," she said with excitement.</p> <p>"I would be happy if you came over and sat down next to me so you could fuck me," he grinned. "Would that be a plus?"</p> <p>"Very." she said, "Now then," she added pointing to his crotch. "Let's get to it."</p> <p>He sat down next to her again. "Are you kidding?!" he said surprised.</p> <p>"Never!" She replied. She had no need for alcohol to go through with this so why not. "You're in your late fifties now. Your cousin, her cousin, your cousin!" She said.</p> <p>"She said she was a doctor," he said confused.</p> <p>"No, she said she had an appointment." she answered.</p> <p>"Now you know her name," he said, "I guess I can keep her."</p> <p>"That's right. She's a very, very beautiful woman."</p> <p>"Oh my god!" he said and laughed.</p> <p>"You're kidding, right?" she asked, surprised.</p> <p>"Nope," he said, "but there's something about how little you have been showing up. She is such a lucky man that just by looking in those movies, he is thinking about her. It's really flattering."</p> <p>She smiled and took another smoke from the cigarette. "That was quite the first time for me," she said with a grin.</p> <p>"It was?" he asked.</p> <p>"Oh yes." she smiled.</p> <p>"So, how the hell am I supposed to stay here?" he asked.</p> <p>"Not to worry," she said, "we can find out."</p> <p>"Good." he said. He turned to her and saw a smile on her face as she raised her glass. "To the evening!" he said and handed hers to her.</p> <p>"It's good to see you here," she laughed asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
