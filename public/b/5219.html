We made ourselves look so real.</p> <p>We had been driving the day after she had returned from her first holiday with a lover. We had stopped for drinks to celebrate her arrival, then after a quiet meal out on a terrace we decided to go for a walk through the gardens. We walked hand-in-hand along a small wooden path, talking about the beauty and quietness of the moment. Suddenly, I was aware of something very odd. My heart beating as a man had been, all day had aroused something which neither I, nor I had had the courage to talk about.</p> <p>"What is that?" I asked curiously.</p> <p>"I couldn't help wondering if this had been the first time I had been with a man since my husband's accident," she replied as if she was reading my mind.</p> <p>"I don't understand," I asked puzzled.</p> <p>"Nothing. It just seems strange that I haven't had any other men."</p> <p>"Well I guess you haven't had sex yet," I answered.</p> <p>"It seems as if we have just been lovers," she replied in a dreamy voice, her voice like sunshine.</p> <p>But then she continued to look over, and look like a model waiting for a model.</p> <p>"Well, we just don't know how to go about it," I replied, with more feeling than curiosity.</p> <p>"That's okay," she said, and then as a sparkle in her eyes, again with a mischievous smile, she continued. "It's just that I just wanted you to know that I really do love you, and, more importantly, there is nothing I wouldn't do. Are you happy with that?"</p> <p>"As long as you don't mind me suggesting it," I added, hoping I could see a smile in her face.</p> <p>"If you get any ideas, maybe you should just go down to the beach and try out that vibrator. Your hand is pretty stiff now and you seem to have had a good time."</p> <p>"Well, I wouldn't know," I answered. "It's a pity we won't be able to afford it."</p> <p>"Let's go!"</p> <p>We headed down the path down into the sea.</p> <p>"Aaahh, no, just like that," she said laughing, "Now put down a towel. Let me do those ropes for you."</p> <p>She came forward and knelt on the cold wet sand, leaving the back of her dress covering her, but her breasts jiggling freely as she moved. A towel was quickly placed in front of her. She leaned back against it, arms on either side, head to one side.</p> <p>I took her hands and then stood to take them, but she simply put one foot out on a chair next to her and spread her legs, giving me a clear view of her glistening pussy. My cock twitched and jerked in anticipation.</p> <p>"Let me do the rest!" she said.</p> <p>"Nonsense!" I replied. "You can do as you like, I just wanted to admire the view."</p> <p>I knelt between hers and began to take them off as if I were in a dream.</p> <p>Her pussy glistened in the light from the sea. I wanted her to feel it on her. I wanted to feel her nakedness. I wanted her to feel good as I put my hands up her dress, and I wanted to see her. I had no idea, as it was a new experience, but after all, I had only just come back from a date with the biggest and best-looking thing I had ever seen.</p> <p>"Oh! That's nice!" gasped a little giggle. "Now just put down the rest!" she added in a girlish, yet stern voice.</p> <p>But I was already kneeling and she had already started to rub my face with her hand, which she placed under her bum, lifting her bum and giving me a little glimpse of her bald, pink pussy lips, from where I could see her thighs peaking, then, as she spread her legs as far as she could stretch them, just about reached her bum. I had no illusions that the feel might make up an exciting or sexy film. In fact to be fair to her she had done the work. But with a beautiful woman and her fingers under her bum so close to my face, I felt the start of a stirring inside.</p> <p>"Oh wow! You are an unbelievably beautiful woman!"</p> <p>"Thank you, it means a lot to me that you liked it when I did it!"</p> <p>"Oh, I have never been this way, it's really nice," she said with a smile, "Now lets get that vibrator."</p> <p>She pushed me onto my back down on a chair and straddled my legs.
