Kiss me for a while."</p> <p>She did as he said and kissed his face then her lips before leaning forward to kiss him once again.</p> <p>As they kissed, they both felt her hands on his hips and then his behind for a moment until they were grinding slowly against each other.</p> <p>"I'm going to make this hard-assed old man crazy," he whispered before giving her the once over with a kiss.</p> <p>They kissed as he began slowly running his hands over her breasts and her back.</p> <p>They continued slowly and were rewarded for that as they soon were going at it with greater passion and eagerness.</p> <p>"I'm getting horny ... I'm so glad I'm holding you in my arms," she said.</p> <p>"Me too," he replied.</p> <p>She gave him one more kiss before turning back to him, this time leaning close and then pulling him on top of her.</p> <p>When she broke the long kiss, she rolled onto her side and put her arms around him.</p> <p>"I'm all for being in bed with you again tonight," she said to him.</p> <p>She rolled back and put her right knee over his right hip and lifted her left knee up until it hovered off the bedside.</p> <p>"Now I've got you in bed all my way," she announced as she began working him quickly again.</p> <p>"Are you OK with this?" she asked. "You look like you're about to go right in."</p> <p>The expression on her face was one of surprise with her reply that he had chosen.</p> <p>"Honey, I'm not sure about this ..."</p> <p>"It isn't a problem," she said as she wrapped her arms around his neck. "If you're going to make me happy, do it. You're the one I love!" she stated with more certainty than before as she held his face and kissed him with as much passion as she had the night before.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" he wondered to himself. "I mean, I don't feel like I should be doing this."</p> <p>"That's OK, sweetheart," Kelly assured him. "It has nothing to do with your old man. After all, he's not much older than you are."</p> <p>She kissed his lips again then reached under his shirt and around with her fingers to play with his already very stiff cock as they kissed.</p> <p>Kelly broke the kiss and looked into his eyes then licked her lips and then began licking his chest and neck, her tongue running over his nipples to tickle them before returning to his throat.</p> <p>She began kissing around his ribcage and worked her way down until she reached his waist. She was a bit more gentle than before to tease, as much as he enjoyed she liked, it had been a while since he'd experienced it, though it was not nearly as long as she liked to have it in her hands. Although the one she enjoyed greatly when she would have been lying and lying across his crotch had been a good reason, it was his best friend as well. It was that she enjoyed the gentle attentions while his wife had been away. He couldn't understand how she could be more eager. She had been doing this for some time. As a friend of the group, he knew he liked it more than any of the other things she did before they met and what felt natural, but she had to admit it was a bit more demanding.</p> <p>She was just finishing kissing down to his waist as she reached the waistband of his shorts. They were just a bit thick and she wanted to take the skin the way only a young man's torso would go, but Kelly wanted to tease him.</p> <p>It didn't take him long to unbutton her shorts and slide them down to release a nice, full, brown, bush. It was short and a deep shade of brown, which made them look even more appealing. She looked up into his eyes and then ran her fingers through the trimmed pubic hair and then back up to capture his attention.</p> <p>Once they'd finished undressing he looked at her, hoping he'd get a chance to look at her more than he usually would have, but he was disappointed. She was beautiful. She was not quite as well dressed as he had imagined or anticipated. He wanted her, he was not sure she could resist that much.
