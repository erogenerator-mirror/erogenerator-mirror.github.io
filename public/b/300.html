My head lolled to one side, looking in horror at how wide open my legs were.</p> <p>"Come on, Sam. Don't hold in the excitement anymore." Sarah pleaded.</p> <p>Slowly, and with a quickened sense of panic, I began to buck again. My knees were splayed lewdly now, offering my dripping wet pussy to whoever I wished. My eyes locked with Sarah's in a fierce, almost painful gaze. My mind was blank, and the world swam below me.</p> <p>"Come on, Sam. What do you think you are doing?" Sarah repeated, almost as she would say to another student "Come back to class."</p> <p>I could feel myself shuddering once more at the new sensations that assaulted my body. Then I looked at Sarah once more and saw fear glistening on her face.</p> <p>"What's the matter with you, Sam? If you can't find your panties now, let us have them." Sarah said, laughing.</p> <p>My head pounded and my eyes rolled back. Then a new feeling of terror began to overcome my body as I suddenly felt a rush of excitement that was not unlike my first. It was more than excitement, more than fear. It was an excitement that seemed to me like the one my first ever. Perhaps it was time to take me home and put that joy inside me, which my classmates were not permitted to have.</p> <p>"Come on, Sam, stop it. We have to go." Sarah said forcefully.</p> <p>My body, now trembling uncontrollably, was like a drug. My head was spinning, my whole life seeming to have turned upside-down to jelly. "Oh god." I muttered as my shaking and shaking legs gave me life.</p> <p>My hands pulled me to my feet, then I felt Sarah's hands on my shoulders. Her face was so close to mine; I had to lean down to meet my lips. My hands went to her beautiful face and began pulling her tighter.</p> <p>"Sam. It's ok. I understand. We're done." Sarah said.</p> <p>I wanted to tell Sarah I stopped this. Then my mouth moved toward her face, but no words came out. My lips left hers and moved toward her face to kiss her.</p> <p>I pressed my body to hers as our kissing intensified. I moved my hips to grind against hers.</p> <p>"I can't do this. I don't want it." I murmured helplessly.</p> <p>Sarah grabbed my hand and led me to the door, where I was immediately pulled back to earth. I felt like I was floating on a cloud of confusion.</p> <p>"No. It's ok. If you want to stop, just tell me, and I'll stop. We can't do this. It's wrong. We're being rude." Sarah urged me to leave.</p> <p>"Oh, god. No, oh no. You have to stop." I stammered as I tried to make my own excuses.</p> <p>Our lips met again. We kissed hungrily, then I felt my hands being pulled from her face.</p> <p>"Stop it. Please, don't." I begged.</p> <p>Slowly I felt Sarah's hands reaching out to cup my cheeks.</p> <p>"We need this. I need this." She said.</p> <p>I felt so safe and so desired. I needed this! I needed this more than anything else now. I closed my eyes and tilted my head backward to take in this incredible opportunity, and yet so far away from everyone that I had just met. All I could see was Sarah's face looking back at me.</p> <p>"I was so scared when I got here." She told me.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, it's ok. It's hard to be scared of you now." Sarah said as she moved her head closer.</p> <p>"I'm not scared now." I told her as I took in her eyes, the soft blonde hair, and the beautiful face in front of my own.</p> <p>She moved her hand from my cheek and began to slowly slide up and down my spine. My own breathing was coming in quick pants now.</p> <p>The feeling of her soft warm hand as her fingers pressed against my bare skin was so different from the fear I felt when we kissed. I shuddered even more and my eyes were shut tight.</p> <p>"Sarah." I whispered hoarsely.</p> <p>She moved her hand lower to feel my smooth thighs for the first time, and then her fingers went back up to my now hot pussy.</p> <p>"Come on, let's go." She said.</p> <p>My body was suddenly on automatic, with a shuddering and shaking feeling. I felt so weak and alone.</p> <p>"I want to. God, I want you." I told her.</p> <p>"Well, let's go." She told me and got outâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
