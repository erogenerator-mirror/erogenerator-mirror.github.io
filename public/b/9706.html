"You have the most beautiful face that I've ever seen."</p> <p>She looked at me.</p> <p>"So beautiful. I can kiss you all night long."</p> <p>She pulled me close and kissed me again. She moaned into my mouth as she tasted me. While we tongue-kissed, I slipped the spaghetti straps of her tank top from her shoulders and gently slid the straps of her bra off her shoulders. It was cool and warm against my bare skin as we kissed. She sighed and pushed her body back against me.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful." I said as I ran my hands up her chest and around to her firm ass. I ran my hands over the firm globes, marveling in their perfection. "I love the way you feel." I said as I caressed the round cheeks.</p> <p>Then, I kissed her again. I moved to the other side of her, and put my hand on the large swell of her breast. I cupped it in my hand, as I looked up into her eyes. I could see her own passion shining through those deep brown eyes.</p> <p>We continued kissing while I rubbed myself against her, feeling her nipple getting hard against my chest. I could feel her arousal begin to build as she pressed against me. Her breasts were soft and warm, and her nipples hard with desire. We were only kissing as long as I could stand the sensation. I moved my hand up her body and she responded without hesitation. I felt her hand on my cock, stroking it in her hand. I leaned back as she pressed her body against me, and she slid her hand down and caressed my balls and shaft in slow circles. Her hand felt like silk against me, and I was feeling that warm, soft feeling of the moment. I couldn't hold it any longer. I had to have her now.</p> <p>I moved back to the end of the couch, and laid her gently on her back. I slid down under the covers, and moved between her legs. I pressed both of her breasts together and began kissing her stomach as I moved around. As I kissed her belly, I felt her pussy begin to twitch as her excitement grew. I moved lower, taking the soft flesh into my mouth, making love to her.</p> <p>She grabbed the back of my head and pressed me more firmly against her. I could feel her excitement through the fabric of her underwear. I kissed her legs and thighs as I slowly moved my hands up higher, rubbing her inner thighs. I took hold of the waistband of her panties, and slowly eased them down her legs.</p> <p>She gasped as my hands slid under her, and felt her body shake with anticipation of what I was about to do. I kissed her inner thighs, moving closer and closer to her love hole. She groaned in anticipation as my hands moved up the soft fabric of her panties and slowly lowered her until my thumbs slid inside.</p> <p>I could feel her wetness as I gently spread her lips, and then I moved a bit further forward. I could feel her body shudder with each pass of my thumbs. I moved the panties down till her legs were bare from the waist. I felt her gasp and her hips buck as I moved them down, exposing her naked mound.</p> <p>I kissed her inner thighs as my hands began to tease her pussy. I was still a bit unsure of what to do until a finger slipped inside of her. Her hands gripped my head, pulling it closer to her and pulling it towards her.</p> <p>Then, I felt the tip of my tongue sliding along her lips. It felt wonderful as I explored her body. Her body began to writhe against me, as I kissed her pussy. She grabbed my head and began pressing against my mouth, trying to bring me back up. I licked her lips, moving my tongue around the edges, tasting her. Then I kissed down her pussy lips as I moved down, kissing the inner flesh, making sure I was getting as much of her as possible.</p> <p>She squirmed and moaned as I licked and kissed her. I could feel her hot wetness as I continued to lick her, my tongue exploring her hole. She moaned again, as I licked her with quick little flicks of my tongue. She was gasping as I felt myself become aroused again. My tongue slipped a little lower... then I did it again.</p> <p>It was very arousing to feel her body writhe against me as I pleasured her with my tongue. I loved it as I brought her to the brink of desire and then backing off, leaving her wanting more.</p> <p>I took my tongue away from her hole, and I began to rub her clit with it. She was still not fully erect, but her body was demanding release. I could taste the wetness of her inner flesh as my tongue slipped deep inside of her and lapped atâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
