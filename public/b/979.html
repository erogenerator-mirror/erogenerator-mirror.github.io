He could practically make out, he was staring at a pair of tits.</p> <p>Lucky was holding something from behind him when another man walked in the back door of the bar. He opened it, and saw he was sitting in a small round booth. He looked around slowly before standing.</p> <p>"Hey, there's a guy here with a beer in his hand," Lucky said. "You coming too?"</p> <p>"Yeah, um, do you want you any?"</p> <p>"Sure. What's next?"</p> <p>"Hey, I'll set up a beer so you can see the bar. Just sit."</p> <p>"Umm, I don't.."</p> <p>"You're not doing anything here, buddy," Lucky said. "I have a friend over there. I brought mine over on Sunday night." He looked up at an older couple at the bar.</p> <p>"Hi, there's your buddy here?"</p> <p>"Yes, I was coming down from Grand Valley for a bit."</p> <p>"And I'm guessing you had a great time that night."</p> <p>"Pretty good," Lucky said with a smile. "Did you see me dance with the chick you had a good time with in Vegas?"</p> <p>"Oh, yeah...she did. A woman I was meeting with, at my parent's house."</p> <p>"Oh, that's a good feeling. It feels good. Do you come in here often?"</p> <p>"No, I've been here this past time. It's nice. It's really good getting to know you."</p> <p>"Oh, so you haven't hooked up with anyone yet?"</p> <p>"Not yet, but we're both married."</p> <p>"Oh."</p> <p>"Look, we're both going to be married when I leave. I've been with women before. But, you know what you need to do..."</p> <p>"Huh? What do you mean?"</p> <p>"You just need to start dating people."</p> <p>"You're kidding."</p> <p>"No, no. I need to get married. I need that love that kind of love. And I need you."</p> <p>"What do you think, do you think there's a chance I'm going to get married?"</p> <p>"You're kidding me."</p> <p>"Nope."</p> <p>"Do me a favor, put on your ring now."</p> <p>"I'm not really sure, but I'm willing to let you know."</p> <p>And there it was. If the ring was okay, she could give one hell of a ring. Lucky handed her the ring and, smiling, slipped it on her finger.</p> <p>"Okay, let's say you marry me in Vegas."</p> <p>"That's an amazing way to get married."</p> <p>"What's not to say? You'd better not be married, right?"</p> <p>"Absolutely."</p> <p>"Good," Lucky said and gave her his best big smile.</p> <p>"Bye, then."</p> <p>Lucky paid for the drinks, and with them in hand, and headed across the street to the hotel.</p> <p>***</p> <p>"Where now?" Lucky asked.</p> <p>"The main floor. I'm going to make a reservation there for the rest of the night. The bar will still be open so I need to get a move on."</p> <p>"That sounds nice."</p> <p>"Sure, you're not staying here? You have to pay the tab. I'm going to find a hotel and maybe go out with you."</p> <p>"No, no...no, you've already done that. And you've done this thing with that guy I saw on the street. I'm married. It's just a night out."</p> <p>"Oh yeah, and that's why we're spending time together."</p> <p>"No, no, it isn't that. We already have this, right?"</p> <p>"I just need some friends and some drinks,"she replied. "Are you in, what, twenty minutes?"</p> <p>"Thirty. It should still be a half hour before I'm leaving. I need to get something to eat."</p> <p>"Okay, fine, give me two minutes."</p> <p>Lucky set her purse down on a table a long ways down the hall that was near the door. She leaned back in her chair. She flipped her hair out from under her ears and looked around the room.</p> <p>"I'll put these things away. I'll take care of everything."</p> <p>Jules and Lucky had made an arrangement for the next thirty minutes.
