She pulled him off, "I thought that I told you to stop!" He didn't stop. She slid his shirt off. His nipples were rock hard, begging for attention. As she bent close to take one in her mouth, he pulled her top down to expose her breast, the nipple still hard.</p> <p>She felt his breath on her nipple, warm, slow, and hard. She wanted him now, she was so wet, he could fill her completely with his mouth.</p> <p>"Please... Oh, God, don't stop..." she whimpered as she began to rock back and forth on top of him. He lifted her leg, so she couldn't reach his cock, but then took her knee in his hand and pulled her into him for his tongue once more. Her hands went to his hair, holding his head to her breast with his mouth.</p> <p>She felt his hands on her waist, pulling her panties down in one swift motion. Her hips rose above him, eager to feel his manhood hard inside her. He lifted a long, deep breath and kissed a trail down her body. She gasped and trembled as his lips reached the junction of her thigh and hip.</p> <p>He paused kissing both her hips, and slowly slid his mouth from her mound, only lightly brushing her lips with his hot mouth and tongue. When his mouth closed over her, his long, soft hair brushed her own skin and sent pulses of pleasure shooting through her body. He trailed his mouth down her length, then back to her hip. He sucked her tender flesh gently into his mouth. He pulled it into his mouth a couple of times, and then slid it slowly back to her. She felt her nipples tighten, and knew her nipple was getting hard, but wanted to feel him inside her.</p> <p>He kissed her hip, and continued his way up, finally leaving a wet trail of saliva. She could feel his erection pressing against her, throbbing with desire. "Please... Make me yours," she whispered.</p> <p>He slid a hand under her ass to cup one perfect cheek in each hand and pulled her toward him. She took his hand and guided it over her, guiding it to her center. She gasped as his finger slid inside her, and his finger brushed against her sensitive clit. "Oh, God," she cried out her body trembling as she began to arch back toward him, wanting his cock inside. "Please... I need you..." she heard herself begging. "I need you to make love to me," she continued, "please, make me yours."</p> <p>"I think you want me now."</p> <p>"I do."</p> <p>He kissed her gently and then slowly slid a knee between her legs, opening her up. He moved his mouth to her breast as his fingers continued to stroke her clit.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want me?" he asked sweetly, still lightly stroking her.</p> <p>"Yes..." she breathed, "I want you to make me yours."</p> <p>She sat straight while he leaned forward, bringing her hips up to his. He moved his face close to her pussy and began to lick slowly from the bottom of her opening to her clit, stopping every time to circle the tip. "Oh, God," she heard herself say, "please... make love to me!"</p> <p>"Are you sure?" he asked, "I would rather you didn't have to say it."</p> <p>She looked down to see her lips slightly parted slightly as she stared at her legs, waiting for his touch, but never felt his warm breath. "If I don't want it, can we stop?" she asked, not wanting it to end.</p> <p>"There's a first time for everything," he answered, "there's nothing you haven't waited for?" he reached up to gently stroke her cheek as he continued to stroke her clit with his tongue.</p> <p>"Oh, God, yes... make me yours," she responded softly.</p> <p>As he moved his tongue over to slip inside her, she reached down between them. As he began to enter her, he placed his hand on her stomach, just below her navel. He could feel her tense as he began to push, feeling his cock slip inside just a little further. His cock was hard and thick and felt so good inside her, she wasn't sure of how she could take it.</p> <p>"I am going to make love to you," he whispered, and again he began to slide in and out slowly. He could feel her relax, and she wondered if maybe it had gotten better after a little practice. He began to move his hips quickly, slowly but steadily, pulling in her and causing her to move with him.</p> <p>"Oh... my... God," she heard herself say. "Yes... I want you to make me yours. I want to take everything you give me."
