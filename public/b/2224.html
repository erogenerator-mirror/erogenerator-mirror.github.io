It's just that some men find you interesting!" He kissed her quickly, then added "and some women seem to think you're pretty sexy too!" His hand moved slowly up her leg, caressing it gently as he did so. Amanda gasped softly at the feeling, as he slid his hand back to her panties.</p> <p>"I see this is just a small token of affection, even for you my love," he teased her. His hand slid under her panties to gently caress her mound, as he said "and then some people have said you are a very attractive woman!" Her knees opened slightly, her body began to shudder as he teased her for a moment then slid her panties off her completely, his fingers sliding gently between her soft soft cheeks, tracing the line of her anus as he did so. Then he pulled her panties free, letting her slide them down her slender legs and off as she tried to sit up. Once her panties were on the floor, he gently lay her on the bed.</p> <p>"Let's just start there dear," he said. He began to unbutton her blouse, letting it fall open as he did so. Amanda felt her already hard nipples pushing against her bra as he worked, and was surprised to find the heat of her arousal even more evident than she had thought. She felt as though she could do with it now, it was all about him, and she had to stop him from doing what he had wanted to do...and why not? She was naked beneath him, her body trembling at his touch. His fingers were working gently into her pubic hair, touching the soft folds of skin inside. Amanda felt her thighs begin to tremble slightly, and she arched herself higher slightly, trying to press onto him as he touched her.</p> <p>"You can tell me if you like!" she said with a smile.</p> <p>"Oh really?" Was his reply. She felt his hand cup her mound again. Her breathing was coming harder, as he began to run her fingers up and down her slit, rubbing and teasing her as his hand pulled aside her labia, then slid deeply into her slit, pulling her lips open with it. Amanda shuddered again, feeling suddenly very close to another orgasm. Her eyes closed tightly, her body rising to meet his probing fingers. "Let's start with this" he said as he slid them out, rubbing back up and down slowly. "Let's go to your front!" he said again. One hand moved slowly up her legs and came very lightly over her engorged, throbbing clitoris, causing Amanda to cry out. "Oh please, let me make you come."</p> <p>Amanda felt ashamed of herself for pleading to help him. Her heart and mind were racing now in the excitement of doing it in front of him. Her fear was quickly replaced with an awareness of her own impending orgasm. She was going through several climaxes before he had finally stopped. Again, the feeling of his finger on her clit was so sensual, so...sensual. Her thighs trembled as he pulled her clit into his face, his nose rubbing the tiny nub. Amanda cried out softly, the sound mingling with her own release. She shuddered as her orgasm coursed through her once again, her own juices flowing liberally as they soaked his finger.</p> <p>"That was wonderful dear," he said. He slid his finger slowly out of her, leaving a streak of her juices there, and he pulled the panties from both legs and then pushed her back flat on the bed, lying alongside her. He drew her to him, placing her body down beside hers. Amanda wrapped her legs gently around his waist, almost of their own volition. He kissed her hard passionately, his tongue darting in and out of her mouth with the ferocity of lust. Amanda felt herself melt further back onto his chest as their bodies came together, his arms holding her tightly to him. He kissed her for what seemed like an eternity, as his hands gently explored the small of her back.</p> <p>"You look beautiful, darling." he said softly. Amanda felt her own breathing deepen as her own heart raced.</p> <p>"You certainly have the body for your own beauty, my love."</p> <p>"I don't think I'm in the position to argue about it" Amanda replied seriously. She felt his erection pressing against her. She didn't move. She wanted the moment to last for as long as possible...</p> <p>Amanda broke away from the kiss and looked into his eyes. She slowly reached into his lap as they lay on their sides, running the tips of her fingers up and down it.</p> <p>"My love..." her voice broke.</p> <p>"Please, let me see you as I take advantage of this moment for myself!" Amanda whispered.</p> <p>"My love" Amanda repeatedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
