When she walked away I noticed that her skirt hadn't come down much. I think she picked up on the fact that she was going to have to wear it in the bathroom, she must have really worn it out all night. She opened the medicine cabinet and took out her dildo. She looked over at me saying something like "It does look kind of sexy." She took out a condom and slipped it on my cock. She pulled my ass towards her and slowly pushed it in. I was not going to be able to stand it, I could barely move. When it was all the way in she pulled it out and told me to turn around. I did as I was told. She sat on the edge and pulled her skirt up and sat down on top of my face. With her legs spread wide, it was hard to breathe and I had no control over myself. I started licking and sucking. It didn't take long. I could feel her start to tense up again. I could sense she was close to orgasm. She lifted her legs and wrapped them around my neck. Her body started to shake uncontrollably. I felt her legs go limp around me.</p> <p>Before she recovered, she took off the condom. With a look of passion on her face, she started to rub the dildo in the juices leaking out and then started to push it in again. With each thrust into her pussy, her orgasm started to build and build. I had never been this turned on. She wanted me to cum inside of her again. I pushed the dildo in deep, just to get her off again. Again she started to rock back and forth. She was moaning loudly. She screamed "I'm cumming with you. Yes, Yes . . " When her orgasm finished, she sat up to look at me. She kissed me and said "I love you." The next thing I knew, I was lying in the bed, with my clothes all over the floor. It wasn't a normal night.</p> <p>She asked me to take the key to the front window. As it was, the blinds had been pushed off. She opened the door and walked out smiling. I got my dildo, put my clothes back on and went to the window.</p> <p>There, I saw a man. I saw a woman. We exchanged photos. I said "I hope that you can get to all the things we did that night. I hope that we can come to some real closure in the future. It is the best feeling I can have for a long time."</p> <p>We left the club. As we went outside, she told me that she hoped that the future we had was not as bad as we thought it would be. She also said that she was really looking forward to the future we had together.</p> <p>We had a good laugh about the next week as I watched her from the pool—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
