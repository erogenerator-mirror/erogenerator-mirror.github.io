The most I could tell though was a certain amount of power, the kind of power that I am sometimes proud of being able to control, and he had no idea I might get him into trouble with his abilities before I had any more of a chance to pull out his mind.</p> <p>It all took the focus off my ability to find where the otherworldly energies existed, and I concentrated on the matter at hand, making a mental note to do that later. I did not want to do anything rash, I wasn't in the mood to argue, I just wanted to let it go.</p> <p>In truth, I felt a certain amount of fear, but it left me feeling excited, which was quite unlike me. When in doubt of my ability, and I have tried to ignore it, it can always lead to things my friends and family wouldn't understand.</p> <p>He did not appear to notice though, he simply watched from a corner of the room. When I reached out my hand, he quickly grabbed it, his eyes darting back and forth, watching me with a very interested look.</p> <p>"It's okay, we will get to the bottom of this soon," I said, and in a very business like tone, with a slightly annoyed tone, I said, "I can't talk over this now, we have more pressing things ahead." He was not convinced, but I could see the same hesitation pass over his face as what would happen in this area. At least that was a good excuse to get him to talk, let him see the truth I had made to him.</p> <p>We left the room, and without saying goodbye, he pulled to me and I felt his arms being lifted and his legs being let go. I took a moment to catch my breath and adjust my stance. He had not moved, and his gaze was still on his hand, which was still gripping my hand, fingers still moving. I didn't have long to wait before I too moved myself slightly and walked into the house, pausing a moment, looking around to make sure I could locate the energy to start with.</p> <p>I felt my mind slip as I reached the door, as I stood on the other side for a moment, looking around quickly. It could have been a moment or two at the most, but in my mind it seemed like an eternity, though it was a brief one.</p> <p>I closed my eyes as I slipped back into the home, pulling up the steps, and making my way up to the first floor. The light was still on, the doors closed, and I was sure this was where he was. He had to be at least fifty yards away, waiting for me to reach the second level.</p> <p>I walked softly up the stairs, feeling the tension left after I had already reached up, and into the next room. A moment later, he opened the door to this room, stepping back and allowing me to enter. I felt the space closing around us, a strong and powerful connection with the energy I had created. It made his own energy very intense at first, and I was certain it was stronger than what he had ever seen before, but that was just the power he had been looking for, nothing else. I could feel it pouring as he came closer to me.</p> <p>He looked at me for a moment, and then slowly took his hand out from my hand. The feeling as his fingers touched, touching, touching again, touching back up to his fingertips, only this connection had nothing to do with the energy I had created. I could see it building, pulsing, flowing through his hands like an unmade mirror, and he had to be looking right into me.</p> <p>"Come in, sit down," he said in a slightly calm and caring voice.</p> <p>He turned on the lamp that was still burning brightly, and then put on a soft, kind little smile with his eyes and a big smile on his face again, before moving away from me. I felt his hands sliding over my body, and his long fingers playing with my body, his hands sliding down to my stomach, my skin, and then up higher, feeling the tension in my core. When his strong hands reached my breasts, their touch on my body, I closed my eyes again, feeling the energy of the whole thing, though my own body was beginning to ache for his touch. It wasn't just the energy, it was the power there in his touch that made it all feel so complete.</p> <p>"I had trouble finding the energy to do what I needed to, when you moved on, but you just left a lot to be desired," I said softly, "I'm sorry-"</p> <p>"...No wait," his hand touched my cheek, and I felt his fingers moving to my lips, sliding over them, and then he gently kissed me.</p> <p>"You have no idea how long Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
