She was panting, her legs spread and her mouth open. I was stroking my cock slowly and deeply with my right hand and rubbing my hand along her inner thigh above her knee. I was teasing her pussy. After a few minutes she pushed me back and climbed in, her eyes still closed. She reached up and grabbed my cock to jack me off into her palm. Her hands were warm and dry. I pumped into her in rhythm as her hands kneaded my balls and tickled the top of my cock. She slid a hand into the wet crevice between her legs and cupped my balls one at a time, tickling lightly.</p> <p>As her excitement escalated to a fever pitch my balls were on the brink and I felt my cum begin to boil. She squeezed and stroked my balls as I pumped into her. The sensation of impending orgasm sent me into my own orgasm, I felt my cock pulsing as hot cum splashed against her stomach.</p> <p>"Oh fuck yeah" I groaned to her.</p> <p>She smiled and I felt her hands on my stomach, fingers lightly tickling me before drifting off under me. I slipped out of her pussy and fell on my back beside her. As I lay there panting I felt her warm, smooth legs gently rest against me. We hugged a lot, her breasts pressing into my chest through the soft towel, her face a little closer to mine. She kissed me softly and we shared the post-coital kisses. I looked at her again, a little embarrassed and horny, she seemed to be smiling too. I pulled back and we kissed again tenderly, my hand on her breast.</p> <p>"My name's Mary" I said and we broke the kiss and stood up, both of us still naked. We went out onto the patio and poured us some glasses of wine. We sipped our wine and sipped a long one. It took us almost thirty minutes to clean our selves off before our hair was all but dry. We had just finished the glass of wine when I said "Let's go in the bedroom and watch TV to relax".</p> <p>"I'd like to see what's on the TV" She said and led me up stairs.</p> <p>We were both naked and I couldn't resist sliding my hands down the back of her legs and cupping her butt cheeks. She giggled as her hand went to my hard cock. "You feel like your body is ready for another fuck?" she asked, not caring that she had me under her spell. "Not necessarily, just your body that's ready for another hot fuck session."</p> <p>I helped her onto the bed and sat against the headboard. She slid her legs apart and began to remove her panties. I stared at her pussy and then slid one hand down to her pussy as I opened up a drawer and removed a large dildo. She moved her legs apart and I slid the dildo inside of her.</p> <p>As it went in, I could feel the vibrations through her pussy. She was wet and ready. I had to do something. I slid my cock back and looked at her.</p> <p>I didn't want to take all night, but it seemed the right thing to do. I was hard again and she had been on her back for awhile, as she had turned on her vibrator the night before. It was hard on me to watch Mary's body in action. Her tits were bouncing as she moved her body. Watching her had got me hard again and I had to have her.</p> <p>"Fuck me" she said as she lay on her back staring into the big black mirror above the bed. I slid my cock between her legs and thrust into her.</p> <p>I put one hand on her chest and the other, she took the dildo. It didn't seem to be on any sort of schedule and as I started to fuck her she moved her body as if we were fucking in a slow paced swing again. I grabbed her tits and she used her arms to reach for my neck for a bit as I was plunging into her, my fingers pinching her nipples. We fucked our brains out. I fucked her hard and fast, she was going nuts on the other end of the phone. I could feel my balls tightening and knew I was going to explode.</p> <p>I could hear an orgasmic sound that sounded like she was cumming. At the height of her climax, I felt the vibrator on her clit. I didn't have it in the room so I just kept pounding her until she screamed and came twice more. I kept fucking her and she kept cumming until she stopped.</p> <p>We fell back onto the bed and she turned on her side with her left foot against my face. I looked at her naked body and felt proud that I could keep her going so long.
