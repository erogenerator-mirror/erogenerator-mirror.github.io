"Lay on your stomach."</p> <p>She complied, looking at the wall with curiosity and apprehension. I spread her arse cheeks and started to gently rub both her cheeks, feeling the muscles clenching to my touch. She tensed a bit, but relaxed again when I reached a finger up to her opening.</p> <p>"Please don't tease me," she pleaded.</p> <p>I chuckled, and ran a finger up to her hole and inside, massaging her clit more. She got a nervous laugh.</p> <p>"I can cum when you do that," she whispered. I laughed again, and pressed my middle finger into her cunt. Her face relaxed and she bit her lip. She was really hot, I thought to myself. I continued to move in and out of her. Eventually I could feel I was starting to push my finger into her ass. She groaned appreciatively.</p> <p>I got more and more adventurous, and pushed in a bit further by rotating my wrist, going deeper with each pass. I could feel myself going into deeper with each pass, but couldn't put it in yet.</p> <p>"Please," she muttered, as if to ask.</p> <p>I withdrew my hand, feeling her muscles starting to contract under my finger. My face flushed as I was about to go on with her, but instead I felt her grab the sheet. I sat on my heels, watching her carefully as she got up. She smiled shyly in front of me.</p> <p>"Let's get out, you stink," as she sat on her stomach and looked at the wall.</p> <p>"You smell of me," I agreed, and got up too.</p> <p>She got dressed, I couldn't help but be tempted to touch her with my bare hands. She still had that worried look in her eye. I decided to wait a little longer until she went on her way.</p> <p>"Where do you live tonight?" I asked her, taking a step closer.</p> <p>"We could stay in bed? You haven't seen my place yet."</p> <p>"I wouldn't mind that, and I would love to," I grinned, and reached out to hold her waist.</p> <p>She made a small sound, and started to turn.</p> <p>"Wait a minute; can I get dressed in my own bathroom?" she said urgently.</p> <p>"Sure," I replied, as I got up, and then bent to get her clothes. She turned around and went to the bathroom.</p> <p>She came in and got dressed as I was getting back under the covers, where she lay, naked and excited.</p> <p>"Well, you're on the pot again," she smiled.</p> <p>"You're one for the dramatic," I added, and got up.</p> <p>She lay there, waiting for me, waiting for the shower curtain being pulled off.</p> <p>"Ok," she said, and went on.</p> <p>"Here. I'll change," I said, as I opened the bedroom door.</p> <p>She came in with me, and I took my time going to her bedside table, and making myself comfortable on the end. I handed her a fresh towel.</p> <p>"Thank you, it was wonderful," she said.</p> <p>She turned over and spread her legs, and I slid in beside her, rubbing her back. I kissed her neck. I was about to go on with her, when the shower curtain was pulled back, and she looked up at me with wide eyes, wondering who it was.</p> <p>"Sorry," she said.</p> <p>I turned around, and looked at her curiously. Her face was flush, still very hot. I wanted to reach out and touch her lips, lick them, taste them, and I saw some moisture on the curve of her chin. She was flushed.</p> <p>"Do you want me?" I asked as I started to rise.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," she replied.</p> <p>I held my breath as I walked out and started to put my clothes on after her shower.</p> <p>"There you go. That was nice. I couldn't have done it by myself," I said after I had got in the shower.</p> <p>"I don't think I've ever done that," she said. "Would you like to see?"</p> <p>"Very very nice. Let's see if we can find out more."</p> <p>After I had got cleaned up, and had a couple glasses of wine, she sat on the bed next toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
