I should be able to explain this,” I said. “I could just go and talk to you. I could just have you hold me in those big cushions.” I could have, I realized, made a pass at her. I could have pulled her into something she hadn’t felt like before, a physical connection. She wasn’t aware of or caring much about it though. “I think we should have a conversation.”</p> <p>She leaned back in her seat, placing her face back into her palms and she closed her eyes. “Fine, but do I have to go through this whole story before I decide what to do?” she asked, not quite understanding the questions. “The whole thing is so much of an experiment. You said you wanted to stay close for a while and I have to admit, I’ve enjoyed it,” I said, grinning. “And I know you’ve enjoyed it too,” I said after a pause. “Do I mean what you meant by staying close? Do you want me to get my hands on your body?” I continued on in a more serious voice. “I just hope you wouldn’t want to stop.” I stopped. “No,” I said, trying to find the courage to continue. A moment passed by and she still hadn’t answered. I waited a couple of seconds. “Are you still there?” I asked, my chest heaving. “You should definitely be. You look so good. I’m just having a nice time.” I continued on in a more measured tone. “Do I look pretty?” I asked. “Yes,” she said, in a quiet whisper, but her breathing quickened.</p> <p>“I’m not looking at you,” I continued and continued on in this vein for another few more minutes. “I’m looking at you.” I said again. I could do it, but I could get nowhere with the rest of this.</p> <p>“This is it,” I thought. “This is how I would have to know,” I thought. Finally, I was sure of what I wanted, just in case. “I need to go talk to you after we finish the story and I want to make sure that you know it,” I said.</p> <p>“Ok,” she said, nodding and smiling at me. “If it makes you feel any better, I think that could be a good start. I’m getting more worried about where this is going. There is this strong chemistry between us. It’s not like we were made for each other.” Her hands found hers and she held them tightly, letting her long nails rake the insides of her fingers. “No, I don’t feel anything at all. I feel like we’re both in the right place for now,” she said. “You do all the talking on your own and I feel more comfortable. You’re all still dressed. It’s nice after the storm,” she said. “It’s like this all is just you,” she said softly. “You are here,” she added. “And I’m here with you,” she said again, smiling.</p> <p>“Thank you,” I said. “For everything.” She took my hand and pulled me to my feet. “No, I mean everything is still great.” She held my hand and kissed the top of my hand softly.</p> <p>We walked the rest of the way and talked, and we talked a lot. It was very easy. It was as if neither of us really understood each other’s problems or wants nor wants or desires. It always seemed to occur to us both at night. When we went to bed together, my mother always made the bed. A few times, in particular, the first two nights we were alone together and had to watch our parents. We had watched them for a very long time, before we ever knew a word about what to say or how to say it. It was a wonderful time, we both understood each other’s desires and needs.</p> <p>“I’m not too sure about this. It was a pretty scary situation," I said after some time of silence.</p> <p>“I think that’s right,�—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
