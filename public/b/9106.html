He was already making his entrance but it was time and he was going to use it. He had taken his clothes off and was now standing in front of her. They were not naked; they were just standing in the middle of a busy, busy living room, surrounded by all these people who had been going to the movies and having them around.</p> <p>He had a beautiful, young face and he was dressed in slacks and loafers. He could see her nipples through her top but she did not seem to notice that. His gaze moved up to just below her breasts where her bra was fastened. He could not believe his luck. Here was a beautiful young woman standing so close to him in the middle of a crowded restaurant. He could feel her breath on his face as he took in the sight. He wondered what she would say if he took things further so he decided to move right on. He put his arms around her from behind.</p> <p>His hands explored her body from her arms to her cheeks. His hands cupped and felt her breasts. She responded by leaning her head back and resting it on his shoulder. He leaned his head down and kissed her neck, her shoulder and then the upper slope of her breast. Her hands were exploring his back, sliding over his belt and under his jeans, feeling his butt. As she slid her hand into his underwear, she could feel his hard cock under the underwear. A small moan escaped her mouth and she knew he was enjoying herself as her hand worked his cock.</p> <p>He could see her nipples hardened by his caress. He knew she had removed her bra because she lifted it up and her nipples were standing rigidly. It was then that he turned to look at her. She was still bent at the waist, leaning all the way forward, with her hands resting on his shoulders while the rest of her weight rested on her chest. He moved her dress up to expose her panty clad pussy and she had her eyes closed, her knees almost together. He knew she liked having her breasts fondled but he did not care. He could smell her, feel the softness of her panties against his nose and he could feel himself getting that tingly feeling he had at first with his wife, on the other end of that vibrator but in the excitement of it all. He lifted her dress and slowly slid a hand down inside. Her panties were soaked. He moved his fingers so they just touched her, she closed her eyes once more and his finger slipped between her lips. He could feel the wetness of her pussy and the swollen folds of her vagina. He knew this was heaven.</p> <p>As his finger rubbed her he put his finger up her opening and slowly slid it up until he could feel the soft insides of her vagina. He slipped it down again until there was nothing inside of her. She arched her back once more, pushing her breasts farther up and he could see a smile on her lips. He had never felt anything like this.</p> <p>His finger slid out until it was just touching the bottom, the tightest place it could be. He slid it up again, feeling how she reacted to his first pass. He continued to rub that spot that the vibrator would have never been able to hit but it was so slippery right now that it did. His finger entered her gently, then went deeper. He could feel the warm walls of her vagina gripping his finger.</p> <p>He wanted more. He wanted her to feel what it felt like to be touched so she would know that he had a real cock inside of her body. He slipped his finger out just as long as he wanted. She was breathing hard again.</p> <p>He raised his hand and brought it up to feel the softness on his hand. His hand felt so incredibly warm and it was only then he took it from her.</p> <p>It had just been her turn too. Now it was his turn to be the center of attention. He took his finger out of her wet hole, wet it with the juices from her vagina, then brought it up to her mouth.</p> <p>"Your turn." He said. He had been on the other side of her, waiting for his turn as a man. She smiled at him and her fingers went to his pants pocket. He lifted his ass so she could pull his pants open and she removed his pants and underwear as well.</p> <p>His cock stood out hard and straight. He did not think he could get any harder if his own hands were moving so they were. This woman seemed to have a way of teasing him and it looked like she wanted more than just a hand.</p> <p>She slid his pants down, then moved one hand to the base of his rod and the other to the top, which was exposed from his pants. She used both hands to touch the head of his cock. Then she reached down further andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
