It's really quite simple. You take everything off, put your underwear back on, and then you lay down next to me. Just lay there for a moment, and then you wait for me."</p> <p>"Oh, yeah," he says with a big smile.</p> <p>"Just as long as we are naked, so what? You're my boyfriend! If you get in trouble, you can just call me. I'll be right in." She reaches over to a sideboard, picks up a small packet of condoms, and throws it toward him. "You're the first person I've ever seen with a condom on!"</p> <p>Jake feels a little embarrassed by the question, particularly since his body reacts and his heartbeat quickens at the question. He doesn't think he's the most attractive man currently out of his clothes, or that he's very muscular, so there's really nothing he won't do to please her. After all, he's been in the same class for a couple years now, and since then, most of the girls here are pretty much just looking for a boyfriend to suck off, and a quick fuck. But he's here, and, well, it actually just feels kind of nice to feel a cock touching him again, since he already knows what a cock feels like. If he had to guess, he'd say it feels very good to have hot sperm shooting into a condom, and he wouldn't be surprised if there was a very good chance that it's the best thing he really has in his life.</p> <p>Then, on with the next sentence. "This is what I think about when I'm playing with myself. It's all very different from what I feel if it's not just a boyfriend. I wonder if he knows what he's doing when he sticks it in."</p> <p>As soon as he says it, Jake feels self conscious feeling about how hard his cock is. It's certainly not in high school, or any one of the other boys on his team. But it feels pretty nice to have it in his hands, and he wants to feel it inside of him. What's a girl to do, he wonders, if she's thinking? She probably doesn't care anyway. "That's good," is all she says after another look around the room.</p> <p>"But I know a condom." She quickly grabs a foil packet from the nightstand in front of her and rolls it down over his cock. "This isn't what you're looking for."</p> <p>Jake quickly gets the condom out of the package, drops it on the bed, and rolls around it to cover his cock. "I don't have anything that's bigger than your dick. It doesn't hurt at all."</p> <p>"Don't worry," she says cheerfully. "It's just what you're expecting is all." She then puts two fingers into the packet. She pulls out a long tube of lubricant, squirts it onto her hand and then wraps one end around the base of his cock, making sure she's all the way around as she begins to put it on. It's a little bit of a risk, but Jake doesn't really want to argue with the condom when that tight little tube is going to be rubbing up and down across the head of his cock.</p> <p>"Is I gonna have to do this for you?"</p> <p>"Oh, yeah." He puts a condom down on his own rock hard cock before she can finish putting them on. "Let me do this for you," she says. "Just relax." After getting his cock lubed up with the extra lubricant, she takes it all the way into her mouth. She slowly sucks the condom on his big cock, trying to get him used to her mouth and her fingers moving around his cock. "Mmm, it's nice. It's so hard, and I can make it feel good."</p> <p>Her fingers are moving smoothly, working up and down on his shaft as she sucks him off. After a second, he notices she has a finger all the way inside of the condom, where her hand started. "How long?" she asks.</p> <p>"I haven't given you a handjob in a while," says Jake.</p> <p>"Me either," she says, and then resumes blowing him as she puts his cock back into the tube of lube. When she sticks one of her fingers in his ass for the first time, he moans.</p> <p>After getting the tip of the condom lubed up, she slides the whole length of her finger into his ass, getting it good and slick. She then brings the finger to her other hand where she strokes him up and down very slowly with her finger. Her whole finger is moving up and down inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
