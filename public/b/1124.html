She had been on fire in the past, and so when I started kissing her lips, the fire seemed to go beyond hot to dull. As my tongue caressed hers, my heart throbbed. This was the first time I'd been on the receiving end of love and lust. Her responsiveness excited me immensely. I had no idea how far I wanted to go. I knew I couldn't resist the passion she gave me whenever she was in my bed at that moment, no matter how much practice she had.</p> <p>I had to kiss her again, and I took my lips away quickly. Once again, I found her lips with mine and made my intentions known. When she responded tentatively at first, and her lips opened, I thought I'd done her some good. As I explored her mouth and tongue with my tongue, I had to admit she was very good. This felt pretty good to me. I found her soft full lips with my own, and with my left hand cupped her firm little rear and ran my thumb over her cheek. She responded immediately, and in a soft moan, as if the slightest sound could be heard.</p> <p>As her breathing sped up under my hand, I found that she was starting to respond well. I leaned down to her lips again, this time slipping my tongue in between them and exploring her tongue with my own.</p> <p>I slipped my hands up to her breasts, and felt her hard nipples pushing and pushing against my palms. They were standing hard almost to her chest.</p> <p>She stopped me as I gently began to pull her blouse up over her shoulders, but I didn't stop. Rather, I began to kiss her neck, slowly working my way up to her mouth. While I had long ago enjoyed kissing a woman, this was a new experience for me.</p> <p>I continued to work her shirt up and she raised her arms, allowing me to remove her blouse. I lifted one of her breasts gently from the bra, and began to suck and lick her nipple. As she did so, I heard her soft gasp of ecstasy. I felt her hand come to rest on top of mine as I continued to suck and touch her.</p> <p>When I sensed she wanted to feel me inside her, I slid my hand up her skirt. It didn't take too much effort for me to discover the warmth and wetness of her pussy. I lightly teased her wet lips before entering her hole, feeling the little hood protecting her inner labia. I teased her a little longer, pushing in a little, then out again. As I continued to massage her pussy, I began to slide two fingers into her, while still sucking and exploring her mouth.</p> <p>After a few minutes of this, I found that my other hand had slipped into her pants, and my fingers were buried in her with only the tip in. We felt each other's breath as my fingers thrust and my hand stroked. It was the most intense, intense thing I've ever felt in my whole life! I had never been with multiple partners before, and I didn't know what I felt right now. There was something about this woman I was going to do to her! And she loved it!</p> <p>I had been looking forward to this for months, hoping her love could come true. When she came, it was unlike anything I had ever felt before. She seemed to take me in deeply, as if we were one. We kissed each other slowly and tenderly, with full lips and her tongue dancing into every inch of my mouth. She held on with everything she had, and we slowly broke apart. The kiss seemed to last an eternity, but she seemed to hold on even longer. My face was flushed with the exertion, and a flush was beginning to spread throughout my body.</p> <p>Our mouths separated slowly, and I could see her eyes glazed. Her lips were swollen and damp; her tongue shiny with the drops of sweat that had collected there. Her eyes looked even sexier with the realization that we had accomplished something, a lot of things that I had rarely imagined. As we broke, I could see that she was still trembling as she looked around the room. I wondered if someone else had walked in at that very moment.</p> <p>She took my hand and led me back to her bed. We lay gently together with our hands touching at various points. She reached down and touched the soft underside of my cock.</p> <p>"I don't know what's gotten into you, Bill. I think someone did," she said.</p> <p>"You're right. You just did something that you'd dreamed of," I assured her.</p> <p>"Just as I've dreamed about it for as long as I can remember, honey," she said in her quiet, shyest voice.</p> <p>Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
