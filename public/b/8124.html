It became more passionate. We had made love, and even enjoyed oral sex, but we talked it was a first for me. She explained, "My ex-husband had a thing for my boobs. I could tell, when I was around him, he like to lick and suck them.</p> <p>When we got in our room, he stripped and we made love for a while. We were both horny as ever. We ended up in the shower, naked as we could be, and when the water ran out, we came to each other. I couldn't hold it in anymore. He wanted to kiss me, and he didn't. Then he climbed into my arms and we kissed. His tongue moved in and out of my mouth. I tasted salt and tangy. He felt my breasts. I don't know if he knew how much I was getting.</p> <p>Then we got up and he told me we needed some sex.</p> <p>"What do you mean?" I asked, looking down at his cock.</p> <p>"What I meant was do you want to have sex again?"</p> <p>"How could I have thought that would be possible?" I answered.</p> <p>"Then you could do it. What time should you be home?"</p> <p>"Tomorrow?" I answered.</p> <p>"Well, that's right after you're on Saturday. Do you need me to go pick up the kids?" he asked.</p> <p>"No, I'm fine. I'm not sure what my parents are going to say. It doesn't matter. I'm staying late but I'll be gone before the kids do."</p> <p>He kissed me before going down stairs.</p> <p>I went in the kitchen to do a sandwich and take it out to the table. She came in and took the sandwich from me, and set it on the night stand. She kissed me deeply, and said, "I have to work this weekend and I won't be able to see you. This was the best way I could have gotten with you."</p> <p>"I can't believe you said that. What is wrong with you?" I asked.</p> <p>"No, your mom isn't home," she said, looking at me with sadness in her eyes. When it got to be late, she took a shower I didn't notice. She said, "I'm going to go shopping."</p> <p>"Did you get a new robe, or anything for the weekend?"</p> <p>"I got a new top that's new, and a new skirt," she giggled.</p> <p>"What does the robe have to do with my weekend?" I asked a little confused.</p> <p>"You need to see," she said with a smile, pointing to her pussy.</p> <p>After I got dressed, she came down to check over on me. She picked up the phone and called the manager. She told her story and the manager was happy to call after she was home, and I was able to see that her pussy was shaved.</p> <p>She told him that she was on a shopping trip this weekend. He told her that it was just the two of the kids. He didn't believe it, but he had the time to get me dressed in something sexy.</p> <p>After we finished, I was walking by the front door with her. When she saw me walking, she asked, "Are you with an unexpected visitor?"</p> <p>I shrugged. "Not really."</p> <p>"Would you like to come over for supper tonight?" she asked.
