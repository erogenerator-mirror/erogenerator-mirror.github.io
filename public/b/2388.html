I can't let that happen again." I replied.</p> <p>"Yes...yes I do love you. You know I did...and you know that I love you. Please...do me again."</p> <p>"I can't, I'm not sure you do. We have talked about this, don't worry I'll stop, I don't want to hurt you again."</p> <p>And I started feeling a rush of happiness. The feelings from the last couple weeks really were growing up again. Maybe I can tell my father that I'm falling for you. I love you in a whole new way. Yes I hope so.</p> <p>"I'm not sure this will go away though, what if everything goes wrong... I would feel better if I knew you were okay with something happening between us. I want to spend my life with you. If you ever give up our relationship, I would agree to try anything, everything to find you."</p> <p>"You're my father, I love you just as much as you love me. But I don't want to go into any of that again... I could never tell you it would just end like this. It'd hurt all my other people and would destroy you when you became my father...please, don't do anything else... I still love you daddy, I know you love me with all your heart, you can trust me too."</p> <p>"I didn't mean to hurt you, you're right...I wanted to stop myself, I didn't know if you would feel good about me as a man, your father was so much older than I am, and there were times when I could think for all the difference between us to get through."</p> <p>"I know, I'm sorry...if I wasn't still your father, I would have made you stop, because I wouldn't have come to you for help."</p> <p>"I never knew you were into this. You could have told me you were going to, you're the man I have always wanted."</p> <p>"Thank you daddy...I've always felt like I had always been a woman, but I never thought that you found me attractive. All I really loved about you was your eyes, and how much of a turn on it was to see yourself in just your underwear... I guess now I know that if you were anything like me in that body I would die to want you."</p> <p>"I have to admit I never thought that I would have to tell you at all. Well, I feel terrible about telling you, I'm in your debt daddy. I'm going to tell you more about you, when we get married, but for right now I'm going to get cleaned up and I'm going to stay in bed and enjoy myself with you for as long as we both like."</p> <p>"Oh sweetheart, you're so sweet, don't worry I'll make sure everything stays the way it is, we are going to have a lot of fun together, I promise."</p> <p>Oh I can't wait. If I feel like I really fell into that role, that's what I would do. Let's get married...oh and you don't have to answer to anything, your dad wants to get me married.</p> <p>"Ok dad.... We both know that I love you more than ever right now and I would love to see you married. Please have me...you can't see me like this."</p> <p>"You are such a sweetheart, have you talked about the other two people that love you so much, I didn't hear you say the words 'we love you so much', and my mind started spinning around 'wanted' instead of 'that is', my head started to roll with excitement at the thought of seeing you as my father's wife. It didn't take long for me to make my decision, and I didn't even have to go and pick up your dad from where he worked. He showed up about 15 minutes before you were going to be leaving for work. That's how long I thought we were going to get married, to get your dad to come back, and get me in bed to please you for our 20 years... I just had to know that I would be with you forever."</p> <p>"Oh I feel the same way sweetheart. So you and I can get married after I leave town, I'll never regret it."</p> <p>"Are we out of here in a hurry?"</p> <p>"No, no...don't talk, you go in. I'll be right upstairs."</p> <p>He just smiled at me, as if he just did all the work, and we got undressed. I couldn't help but think what a strange thing it would feel that he liked seeing me nude, so I thought better of it and just took off my skirt. I took off my panties as well before leaving the bathroom. I just couldn't waitâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
