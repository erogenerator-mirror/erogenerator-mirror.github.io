Are you sure? I mean after all we've talked about, I'm sure you can do with a little foreplay."</p> <p>"Well I don't know," he said smiling and leaning back and putting his arms behind his head.</p> <p>"There's nothing wrong with a little foreplay."</p> <p>"Not really," he said with a grin.</p> <p>"So just put your hands behind your head and let me get a little of you for a minute."</p> <p>He looked at her for a moment, not really surprised at her comment about his wife's experience. It's not like there was anything wrong with having foreplay to begin with, but something always came up in her office or in their marriage to her husband. It was always about the sex, the talk, and the way. It was more than a little different now.</p> <p>"You won't find what you want?" she asked him.</p> <p>"Yes," he replied. "But not the way a little foreplay could be so that you can help me get hard."</p> <p>"You mean, without going all the way?"</p> <p>"No. You'll find what you want, and in time I'm sure you'll be ready for me to put it in." She laughed, "Or have my husband have my pussy for a little longer."</p> <p>He took that to mean that he was ready.</p> <p>"Here or the bed?"</p> <p>"We don't need that," she said giggling as she leaned over and put her hand on his chest.</p> <p>"No, I'm not thinking of that," he said pulling her to him.</p> <p>"Why not?"</p> <p>"We aren't really," he said with a shrug.</p> <p>"Then why not?" she said leaning back against him and closing her eyes.</p> <p>"Why not just get off, right here?"</p> <p>"You'll do it, right now."</p> <p>"Nope it's up to you. Now put your hands over yours, or I'll go crazy."</p> <p>She opened her eyes and looked up at him. "How could I do that while I'm naked," she asked, "while you still have all of my clothes."</p> <p>In her office chair, she pulled down her panties and stood up on her knees. "No, I want to do this first. It'll just be sex, so just let me give you some of what you're so glad to find out. Just lie back and let me do what I'd like to and I'll be gone by the time it starts to make you uncomfortable in any way. But don't worry, I promise I'll never force you."</p> <p>He took on his normal expression, but she could see a little grin on his lips. It was obvious he was excited, and she could feel it in her pussy. He lay back and spread his legs and she climbed up her knees until she was kneeling between them. She got him to grasp her waist and put his hands on her ass.</p> <p>"This'll be great," she said smiling at him as she began rubbing her pussy lips against his face. "Oh you'll see," she whispered, "this way I can do whatever I know how to make you uncomfortable."</p> <p>She began lapping away, licking and swirling her tongue on his balls and licking and sucking them. And she knew damn well that she was driving him crazy too. It never ceased to amazed her how he loved sucking her pussy when you had your head nestled between her legs. He took advantage of this whenever he could and now it was just a matter of keeping her from calling the first client that night.</p> <p>His hands moved to her breasts as she teased his cock. He caressed them in his fingers before running them over them, feeling each soft surface with his fingertips. Her hands went back to her pussy, teasing her lips as she moved closer to the tip. With her mouth still sucking on his cock and her fingers rubbing her clit, she knew she wouldn't last very long. Her mouth opened just a little wider and when she felt his finger slip into her pussy, she exploded, a powerful wave of juice flooded her mouth. It was one of the greatest orgasms ever, even better in that moment. Her hands had moved back to his cock, and she was determined to make him come as hard as she could.</p> <p>Then her body went limp. He was still in her mouth, but she knew better. He was already limp, and so he didn't last very long. She was glad when she tasted his cum, after all the times the man had given her so much pleasure, but she was happy after feeling him fill her mouth. She kept licking him, letting his cock slip from her mouth with a 'pop' sound.</p> <p>She climbed over him, lying on her back. He was lyingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
