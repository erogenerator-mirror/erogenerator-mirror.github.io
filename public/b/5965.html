I smiled and winked at him. He returned the wink as we left. "I like the way your slutty wife looks."</p> <p>He just grinned and said "So this is who your slut feels like." I smiled back and reached over putting my hands on his chest and gave him a very sexy kiss. We walked on in and I was not sure what happened until he slid his arms around my back and pulled me closer to him. His hands slid up and caressed my breasts and slid down and he started to play with my pussy.</p> <p>I leaned over and put my body on top of his and whispered "You're married?"</p> <p>"Yes darling. I'm married."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Yes. You're my husband, but I guess you know what I mean. You're not being married are you?"</p> <p>"No. My wife and I have discussed the matter and are looking at each other."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Our conversations and our talk have been great. You don't mind your wife fucking another man in front of you are you?"</p> <p>"No," he said and then kissed me again, but this time a little harder.</p> <p>"She's never asked me to do that if I tell her I'm going to have sex with another man."</p> <p>"Yes, but only with you, not a stranger. I never have."</p> <p>"That was very funny. If anyone ever asks us if you ever do, you're out of our marriage. I know I should not have asked you to join me and your wife in bed."</p> <p>I looked over to the other couple that had stopped to take a drink. "You have been chatting with your wife at the bar tonight you pervert."</p> <p>"Not all of you are perverts. You all are very attractive, sexy women, who love it."</p> <p>"Wouldn't it be easier for you to say to me that you haven't had sex with anyone," I said with a smile in my voice as I turned and walked away. Then I started laughing and walked down the stairs.</p> <p>My husband yelled for me to hurry up. "Where are we going to do this?"</p> <p>I knew this guy would not take no for an answer. He knew what I wanted and he knew what kind of woman I was. All he had to do was pull me back to him and he would do it. His kiss was so passionate I thought I was in love with him. He was almost out of breath and very serious. I let go of his chest and walked to the door and opened it and said to him to wait another minute to let me in.</p> <p>I walked back slowly as he watched me walk slowly by. He was almost naked and I was still wearing my skirt and blouse as we walked into the bedroom. There seemed to be a lot of conversation that followed this but I knew what the two men in conversation really talked about: me fucking another man.</p> <p>The door closed behind us and we knew our adventure was about to begin.</p> <p>I started by going to his feet and pulling his shirt up over them. Then I started to unbuckle his belt and unzip his pants letting them drop to the floor.</p> <p>My husband was looking down at my beautiful face. I kissed him hard and deep on his lips. I could feel his hands caressing as I continued to kiss his mouth. His hands were on my breasts but I told him I wanted him to play with my pussy, too. He knelt down and undid my skirt letting it fall to the floor. As he looked up at me he slid his hands between my legs and pressed his fingers against my clit causing my orgasm to surge forward. As the waves subsided he took his fingers out and slowly started to kiss my nipples again. He sucked them for a long time and slowly rubbed down my stomach while he was kissing my breast. Soon he had my shirt off as he nibbled and kissed my breasts. He took my bra down with his mouth and began to kiss my naked breasts once more.</p> <p>"Mmmmmmmm! Ooooooohhhhhhhh! You're making me so hot, please make me cum!"</p> <p>I took him in my arms and moved a little so he could rub my wet pussy. Then I had him sit on the edge of the bed and pulled his pants down. He was a very beautiful young man and he was not at all ashamed about being naked for me. I kissed his cock as it went in and kissed his balls and continued to kiss and suck them.</p> <p>He placed my hands on his waist as I moved my mouth to his beautiful cock. I looked up to see my face inches from his big cock as I put his big cock into my mouth.</p> <p>I took it deeply into my mouth and took in as muchâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
