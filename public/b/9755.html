I replied, kissing her neck slowly, kissing her ear and her neck.</p> <p>I continued, "Now, get on with your work. I want to get you there."</p> <p>"It won't be long. It'll only be for a little while." I was teasing her. I hoped she realized I was trying to win her over.</p> <p>As soon as the words came out of my mouth, she started to kiss my neck and face with a soft lingering kiss, and whispered, "I love you."</p> <p>"I love you too," I replied with a smile, and a kiss that made her melt.</p> <p>After a minute, she got up to wash her hands, and as she was brushing past me, I reached out to her and drew the spaghetti strap t-shirt up; "It'll keep me warm."</p> <p>Cathy looked back at me and gave me a wicked smile, and said, "I need to be a little more modest. If you don't mind." She leaned over towards me, and gave me a sexy wink. We kissed and kissed for a long moment before I said, "Why don't I take a little nap?"</p> <p>It was all I could do not to burst out laughing and say, "What are you so happy about?"</p> <p>She gave me a smile that said, "I think I need to get in the water!"</p> <p>We sat side by side on the couch, watching a movie, and I got up to take a leak. It was a good one that I found in the living room, so I quickly went to get a fresh one, and returned with the bottle. I took the cold bottle in my hand, then bent over and kissed her again.</p> <p>"Do you want me to take care to make myself look...slutty?" I didn't know how to answer that, so I just kissed her again, and said, "I guess so," and turned to go. The second I got to my bedroom, I was on my phone to send a very tempting pic of me on my back top.</p> <p>We started to kiss again, and I knew her eyes were half open. I got up from the couch, and took my t-shirt off. Then I turned her over, and knelt between her legs. I had to give her a little push to get her to rise. While I was doing so, I pulled her shorts off, and kissed and licked her inner thighs. She groaned and said, "You're making me so horny..." and I took her outer lips into my mouth, and licked the length of them, starting at the bottom, then up again...and down again... Finally, I ran my tongue through her, into her vagina; and up again... And back down again, and then sucked each of her large outer lips into my mouth. I ran my tongue around her clitoris, which immediately began to swell, and she came; a huge orgasm that made her body tremble, and then collapse in one massive sigh that was the most incredible thing I had ever seen.</p> <p>When I was finished tasting all of her juices, I took off her shorts and panties, and said, "Now I must get off" as I stood. It took her some time to get them off, and she stood there for a moment, before she could take them off, her lovely dark bush glistening with her moisture. That was the first time I saw Cathy completely nude, in fact, and I was speechless. She had a full bush of hair, just a hint of pink, about 3 inches above the top of her pussy - I had seen it before, but I had never paid it much attention.</p> <p>She stood there, looking incredibly sexy as she took in her naked body; then she reached out to her pussy, and slipped a finger inside, sliding it in and out, and spreading herself slightly. "I didn't know my sex life was this hairy..." she said, with a look of disappointment, as she sat back down on the bed and continued to play with herself. "This is so much fun!"</p> <p>I said "Good" as I climbed onto the bed. "Lie down on your back" I told her, taking a minute to get my breath back. She sat on the edge of the bed, and I reached around her body to stroke her arms and back, my fingers moving around the sides of her breasts, and my hand slowly moving down her tummy to her pubic hair. When my fingers came close to her vagina, she stopped me, and said, "I don't think you should touch me there, like this," as she reached for me. My cock was getting very hard again, and I could tell it was hurting my jeans.</p> <p>She reached down and touched her clit, and said "No touching me there. It's not fairâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
