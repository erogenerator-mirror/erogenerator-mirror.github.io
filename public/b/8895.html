You know, I was very nice. I'm sorry for intruding."</p> <p>"I know it must have been quite rude," she said, "but I wanted to ask you if you had any fantasies I could fulfill one?" she asked.</p> <p>"You know, I can't really say. You might have to ask the boss, too."</p> <p>"I know that. I wouldn't want to disappoint him."</p> <p>"Well, maybe I could help. Do you have any fantasies you like to give to my old man?"</p> <p>"I can't answer that, although I could ask him for more information."</p> <p>"I am sure he'll probably love to have you join him again, just to be sure, of course. I mean, I've always liked it when my man's around after he does the same, but I can't believe I'm asking you to do that as a favor to me. I haven't given him much of a blow out in years, but I know I could definitely have you back in the house by now. I mean, this is where he takes my clothes off with his eyes when he goes out there for a day! And then I'll go down on you, do all sorts of nasty things to him afterwards just to ensure he's just as enthusiastic about it as I would be." she said.</p> <p>"You know, you're right. As long as it's still on the terms that's required, I have no problem with it. I wouldn't think any harm at all. Besides, I've probably lost a little weight from the old days."</p> <p>"I know, but you're in pretty good shape. I really like seeing a lot of you. And besides, I'm sure we'd have a lot to talk about, right?"</p> <p>"Yes, we'd. So?" I asked, "What's it going to be?"</p> <p>"Well, I was wondering if we could start early. I mean, he's not done having me show him my tits yet, is he?"</p> <p>That actually intrigued me, especially after the initial shock of it being his own daughter that had just told me she was going to show him her tits, though this time, it wasn't anything like that. I had to have her do it for me, just to get the reaction that I was hoping was going to come. So she agreed.</p> <p>The following evening, after dinner and after we all cleaned up the dishes, Mary and I decided to get the computer to work on a new subject I had picked up from one of the student websites.</p> <p>"How old is your husband?"</p> <p>"He's in his early 70's. I guess he has had his share of girlfriends, in college."</p> <p>"Who?"</p> <p>"All the girls, probably."</p> <p>"How old are all these girls, Mary? How old are your husband's friends in such a way?"</p> <p>"No, not really."</p> <p>"So what does your husband's friends have to do with you showing someone your tits?" as she leaned over toward me so her breasts were inches from my face, I could smell the aroma of her skin on her breath.</p> <p>"I, ah, I don't know."</p> <p>"Well, don't worry about it."</p> <p>"OK, then that's fine," and she just started to laugh.</p> <p>"Look, I'm kind of busy. Why don't you two have some coffee and maybe some supper. That way it will be awhile before I am able to finish these tasks."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Coffee, supper, and the Internet are on my agenda, I'm sure. So if you don't want to take the lead at any point that might embarrass you and perhaps embarrass me, we'll just have to go our separate ways." And we had, actually. The next day, as I was writing up the assignment for the week, I was thinking about my first time with another woman, and how good it felt to know that my own daughter's tits had been the cause for such a reaction. And now I was even thinking about it.</p> <p>I had my paper complete and was putting it in the printer. I put the paper down and stood and moved toward Mary again.</p> <p>"Would you like for me to demonstrate on you what it is I don't know?"</p> <p>"Don't you dare."</p> <p>"OK, what do I do."</p> <p>"No, no, nothing like that," and I reached down and put a hand on her shoulder. Then I ran the hand under her shirt and up her neck, and then, as I was pulling it off, ran my hand over her breasts, letting my fingers rub her nipples. "Now don't," she said. And I did, pushing her shirt up, and pulling it up while Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
