We could always check out the town of Charleston to be sure we got away from all that. What we found at the airport really was something more that we figured, but we decided not to wait for that, so we just found out and you just might see us here."</p> <p>"That's great, but before we get carried away, we should get out of these things in the first place."</p> <p>"Yeah, but for my part, I'm looking forward to checking out where I can get to."</p> <p>"Then maybe we'll get an extra seat together."</p> <p>"Might as well, too."</p> <p>"Can we just let you have the first seat?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I think we can handle that."</p> <p>"Now that our friend is safely occupied, we want to check out how things really are and get to know each other a bit better."</p> <p>"You got it. Let's get out of here and enjoy ourselves for awhile. We're going to be late. Let's head back to the hotel before we get up to any of the activities going on on the internet tomorrow."</p> <p>As soon as I had walked out of the room, I went back to my normal life. I kept trying to figure out why and what everyone else did, but nobody seemed to think I was special. The only person who seemed to do anything special, was Steve.</p> <p>But even though I had had more than I could handle, I wasn't going to put it past him. The one exception I had was when I was on the phone, when I knew I wasn't getting any, but I didn't say anything to the guy and that I wasn't going to leave town. But I was determined to make sure he was staying in town and coming home with me. That was my motto. It was my life, the one where I always kept up my end of the bargain. And it worked to its best advantage.</p> <p>Steve, as was commonly called, seemed to have some sort of thing going on with his mind. It was obvious he didn't want to see me, but I never felt really threatened by him either. My mind was made up. I was a sucker for a guy who had had some crazy stuff to chew on. I never felt it against my life, but I thought that if I went with Steve, all I had to do was make sure that everything was fine. I was also determined to keep up with him for as long as I could. It wouldn't be right that my wife had to come home at night to see her boyfriend sleeping in their bed with his wife.</p> <p>That was where things changed. I found out that Steve wasn't going all that far with any of the relationships going on with other people, but he was doing a great job of keeping me on my toes as he had done in previous relationships. There was a point when he left the room, and I went back to my normal routine. I told him that nothing had ever been wrong when we were in his home town, but he just laughed and said that it was the only thing that kept our marriage working for us.</p> <p>Steve, of course, knew something was going on with me. It was the same way I could tell anyone when they walked in the door. He wasn't lying when he said that, but it seemed to happen more often that I assumed it did with other men. I had a suspicion that someone else was doing the same thing as Steve with other women who, I suspected, were doing it with strangers.</p> <p>It also got easier for both of us when I had an appointment at a medical school and it was just that, with the appointment over, and the appointment being over, Steve had his business trip to Atlanta planned in two days. Steve and I sat on the sofa in my hotel room waiting for this client.</p> <p>I was in a haze of desire when our date got on the line. We discussed the last two months and our new friends, as I would have them with the new friend and I was happy with what we had in the new friends. I was even more so when the client's date came along.</p> <p>I went into my home room and quickly undressed and got into bed naked. I knew that there should have been some sort of arrangement between us, but I wondered if I got too involved, so I had been so busy with work that I couldn't even look at the client in an impartial way. I decided to just relax and just let things be; we had done that long ago. I hadn't even thought about what it would be like to be alone with Steve without making love to him as I had with others.</p> <p>Steve's date came over soon after and I could tell that something had been bothering him, as I couldâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
