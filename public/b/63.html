It made easy access when we went inside.</p> <p>"Nice outfit."</p> <p>"Thanks. Do you want a Coke? I'm going to go get a beer."</p> <p>"Just a Coke I'm fine."</p> <p>She leaned in and kissed my cheek and said, "Don't worry babe, I will be back soon."</p> <p>When she came back out she looked as beautiful as ever. She had on a simple silk kimono, and a silk scarf covering her face. The scarf had some very thin straps over it that just covered her nipples and her whole body. I tried to imagine what she looked like without her robe and it got me hard. She was leaning back with her arms splayed out around her head and it came out of her blouse enough for me to see a nice firm butt. She had on a silk and lace teddy that barely covered her belly button. The little patch of black lace that covered her pussy was thin enough to show that she was really aroused. She walked over and kissed me on the cheek, stepped out of the bedroom, and headed to the kitchen. I was standing on the left side of the bed, and the other side had a chair. I looked back and saw that my wife was sitting up facing me, and I could see the top of her stockings. This was getting me really hard.</p> <p>She was putting out a couple of drinks. As soon as she returned I noticed that she had put on something under the kimono. I have to admit at first the silk felt strange, but after a few more sips I was having a great time. The scarf was only a cover, but she looked very good dressed in it, which I was looking forward to.</p> <p>I wanted to pull her close and give her a sensuous kiss. I didn't. Instead I looked over at the chair and noticed that the back was turned. A look of lust on her face made me want to see her as she lay there. She had her feet on the armrests and she was slowly moving her hips up and down. Just looking at her made me want to grab her thighs and take her, make her orgasm. It didn't make me want to go to my bedroom and jerk off. I wanted to do that right here. And I was afraid that we would make a fool out of ourselves. I didn't want to risk that either. That would probably come later.</p> <p>Suddenly Jennifer turned and looked at me. I could see her breathing hard, but her face was calm and not lustful.</p> <p>"I'll go get you a drink."</p> <p>"That would be great." I said. We both headed up to the kitchen to get our drinks. She got us all the way to the kitchen, and set us each a couple of drinks, and handed me one as she headed back upstairs. It was kind of cute watching myself in the kitchen getting a beer and thinking about what my wife had just done to her.</p> <p>I was thinking about her every last second of the last few minutes. Thinking about it and all the things my wife had done to me. All of those actions and thoughts that came up in our relationship. It all seemed so new to me that I had a hard time keeping my attention on her.</p> <p>She was back in just a few minutes. She had put the drink on the counter and was pouring us both another drink. As we were standing there she bent down to kiss me, put her soft lips directly on mine and said, "I see you are enjoying yourself. I didn't realize." Then she turned around and leaned back against the counter.</p> <p>"Well, I can't tell for sure if what I'm feeling is wrong. Just because I know what my actions say and what I am thinking about doesn't mean I want to stop."</p> <p>I walked over to her and took the glass from her and drank. There was a real sweetness to her voice this time. I was so lost for a moment.</p> <p>"I don't know what to say. I really don't know how to say this or say how we really feel about ourselves. I guess it feels wrong to have sex with a woman."</p> <p>"Don't go getting all self-obsessed." Jennifer said, her eyes smiling as she took my beer. "You're not the first guy I've been with. The first I ever put my foot on, and then the last one, did it. You were just an object that I wanted to hold for my own pleasure, but as soon as you walked in the room as a man I wanted to feel and experience what you were feeling. It is just like your first time in my house. I have had a lot of wild orgasms, but it has been a long timeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
