They got to their feet in relative silence, the only sound the rumble of their heavy boots making the place feel as empty as an hour's worth of concrete.</p> <p>"Fuck!" John snorted.</p> <p>"What?" Ashley's voice was a little sharper than usual, as if someone just thought she should be angry.</p> <p>"I don't fucking care, I fucking...damn!" John snarled. He grabbed his coat and quickly straightened it out. The air felt as if it was being forced from his lungs, "Fucking, fuck, fuck," and the sound became louder.</p> <p>"Jesus," Ashley was saying in a voice that was a fraction as high as John's, "I'm sorry, I wasn't listening! I was going to call out your name. I was going to call out your name. And fuck, fuck, fuck!" With that, the door burst open again and it was the sound of thunder on the other side.</p> <p>John shook off the debris and his car. He turned and walked towards Ashley's. He stood there before her with his arms folded and his eyes searching hers for some explanation his hands wouldn't give his own.</p> <p>"I'm sorry."</p> <p>"No. No, don't be. Don't." John sat her down on the couch, "No. Don't worry. We can't stop this right here, in our heads. We can't do anything without having a plan. It's not going to work tonight as far as I know, you're going to have to come down and join us." His words hit John like a slap in the face and it made his stomach lurch, his mouth hanging open. He pulled out a chair and put it in front of her, "Can I take that thing with me?" He nodded before taking his coat off, "Can we keep this to ourselves?" His eyes returned to hers.</p> <p>When his voice caught in his throat he wasn't even sure he'd heard it come, "Do you have to do this?" He reached out for her hand, "I don't need for it."</p> <p>"Don't be a fucking pussy, fuck! And get the fuck out of my house!" She tried to pull her hand back, he held it there gently. He leaned in and kissed her neck lightly, "Now, if you don't-" And then his lips were pulling back.</p> <p>John was lost in pleasure. He had been in this state forever. He had tried hard to stop before she got to this point, but it was impossible. He wasn't allowed to stop before this point. He kissed her again, moving on to her lips. He was so close to her now that he could feel her skin, as if she were wearing a piece of him.</p> <p>Her lips were softer than he'd expected, and he could see her tongue moving into his mouth to caress his tongue. And then her hands were on his shirt buttons, pulling them down and sliding it off his shoulders. She rubbed his chest, making him shiver in pleasure. He let her pull his shirt off, and dropped it to throw it to the side as they kissed.</p> <p>His hands were already on her breasts, his fingers brushing along the sides of her breast, but she didn't stop him for any more than that. He slid his hand down to her stomach, he could feel the soft lace and the soft satin panties, the scent of her.</p> <p>"Fuck me." She whispered. She was naked now but for her jeans. Her eyes were still closed and she opened her eyes and took his face in her hands. John's face was tinged with red, but his mouth was smiling. "Please." The words were not meant as a request, but to make sure they weren't too loud, "Fuck me." And when she didn't say stop, he said nothing.</p> <p>John kissed his way down Ashley's neck. His hands were still covering her breasts from his view. She moved her hands to cover his, so that she could better feel his hands instead of just touching. With her hands, he didn't want to push her down to the couch. But it was too late. She was on her back on the couch and she had taken her jeans off. Now she was wearing only a white lacy bra that he knew that her breasts were much smaller than hers and so were her panties. Without being told by her, he reached both hands towards her now exposed, shaved pussy.</p> <p>"Oh, Jesus, no." Ashley was moaning now, and John knew just how excited she was. And, so was he. He could feel himself grow hard under her. His hands made their way even lower, and then he was reaching the top of her panties where there was softâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
