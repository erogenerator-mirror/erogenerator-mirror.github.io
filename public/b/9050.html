He sighed, taking a moment to catch his breath.</p> <p>"I have missed you," he said, as he kissed her neck.</p> <p>"And I have missed your touch," she confessed. He kissed her lips again, deeply this time, and she moaned deep in her throat.</p> <p>"Mmm, what time is it?" he said as he put a hand on her hip.</p> <p>"It's early," she told him.</p> <p>"Come on, the kids will be at school soon. I have to pick them up from bed."</p> <p>"No, baby, I have to go home now," she pouted. He kissed her again, and she groaned at his touch. He took a step back to admire her. "Now go back in there and take care of your man. We haven't even gone the whole way yet."</p> <p>Kneeling in the middle of the bed, her beautiful lips parted as she began to caress him, slowly, sensually. Her tongue licked the length of his shaft before she engulfed him to the back of her throat, again and again. He had never felt anything like what he was feeling right now. Her lips, fingers, and tongue were magic. When she stopped, he almost groaned, but the thought kept him quiet. Then she began to move up and down on him, taking his cock deeply into her mouth, then pulling all the way up in the next upstroke. When she felt he was ready to explode, she slowed down.</p> <p>"Wait!" he said impatiently.</p> <p>"What?" she asked, as she removed a bit of herself from her mouth and held her breasts as they glistened from her saliva.</p> <p>"You're not wearing a bra," he said. "So we'll have to remove each other's clothes and fuck right here." She laughed.</p> <p>"Now, I need some serious fucking," she said, as she quickly stripped off his shirt and shorts. She knelt down and wrapped her arms around his body, and kissed his cock and balls. She then sat up and straddled him. She placed his cock into her waiting pussy and rode him slowly and gently. As she rode him, she stroked herself with her other hand, rubbing her clit against the base of his shaft before she put her hand on his shoulder to steady herself. She kissed him once or twice, then stood up and stood over him.</p> <p>"I want you to hold me. Feel every drop of my cum drip onto your body," she said, as she lowered herself onto his lap and kissed him all over. The whole time, she took his cock into her pussy, feeling the weight of his body with each one she took. "Now fuck me!" she screamed. He obliged quickly, picking her up into the air and laying her on the sheets. His cock throbbed as he entered her again, pushing in until his balls rested on her ass and his cock was almost all she could take. She was so incredibly wet for him, it wouldn't have mattered after just a few moments of him fucking her. For a woman, they were a team.</p> <p>"Oh God, I am going to come," she cried out as she began to ride him faster. As she did, he began to kiss and lick her nipples, before pushing his tongue down to touch her clit. His cock throbbed as he watched her breasts bounce. He pulled on her nipples, watching her chest and torso jiggle as he did so, causing her to moan and squirm beneath him. For long minutes he held himself in that position. As he began to tense, she knew he was about to cum. She wanted it to last. Feeling the first blast splash into her, she leaned forward and kissed him again, letting him slip from her mouth.</p> <p>As they kissed, his cock began to soften, but it did not stop. She continued to lower herself on him, feeling the last of her cum drip onto her sheets, until she felt him begin to soften. "Oh," she said, "not so fast," as she lowered her face to the side of his and wrapped her arms around his neck.</p> <p>When he got his breath back, he looked over at her with a look that made him shiver. "Your turn now," he said. She leaned on him, giving him a view of her breasts as they pushed up at him. He kissed her softly. "Now," he said. As she turned up his leg, he sat up and leaned on his hands to lie his naked body down onto the sheets.</p> <p>"I have missed you so much," he said, his voice still deep and heavy.</p> <p>"Oh, what have I got to do with this?"</p> <p>"Well, it looks like you'veâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
