In fact, you're not supposed to actually walk in this room but...I swear, if you did go into the house you could hear us," he said with mock severity.</p> <p>"We can't hear you here, and I can't hear you," she countered.</p> <p>"You're only doing this to torture yourself, not that you're a mind reader. Now do you have any idea where we are?" he questioned her.</p> <p>"I don't know but I don't wanna go any further, please tell me you're not in here," she implored him.</p> <p>"You've got to be kidding. I'm inside," he replied, shaking his head.</p> <p>"I'm in my car, I'm walking home," she tried to keep her eyes lowered.</p> <p>"No, you're not! That's ridiculous! You've gotta go home. I'll see you at home," he answered her with a calm shrug as his eyes darted around the store.</p> <p>"I don't even feel like going anywhere," she replied, "come on. I'll give you directions to the house."</p> <p>"I can't wait to see you," he said with a small smile.</p> <p>He was going to go out after having talked it over with her, but his heart sunk. She had been so adamant that the game was wrong and he wanted to go home but he knew that they wouldn't have the strength to get out of there. He knew a lot about his friends and family but he had no idea for whom one of them might be. He could feel the anger and hurt when she called him silly, at least for the times that she had called him silly that she called him stupid. Now he understood what he had to do to win her back. He wasn't getting a divorce but he could always find and break into her house after she'd made plans to go somewhere else.</p> <p>He hated that bitch Angela for what she'd done to him, and as much as he hated the situation, he never understood a person's anger and the feelings of hurt that she'd brought her friends to. He shook himself back to reality and took a deep breath before he opened the door.</p> <p>"See you soon," he said as he turned and smiled.</p> <p>"See you soon," she replied, turning on her heel as she walked towards the car.</p> <p>He turned and ran, catching her when she got close. He dropped her hand before he had time for a fight and caught her by the arm. She fell to the floor, her eyes downcast as she cried. He wrapped his arms around her, holding her tight. She sobbed and sobbed as he carried her like a bride to her last minute wedding night. He carried her to the car and held her against it while she sobbed. He didn't think she was ready to leave but he wasn't gonna let up. She wasn't a baby, she was supposed to be a woman. He loved her that much that she had to leave, but he wouldn't let her go. He knew that she would always be his woman and that it was alright to try to leave but if she felt she would do such things to him, to even be tempted by him, then he wouldn't be able to live with this. It made him feel like she was his and he didn't want to be that way. He looked down at her and wondered if something was wrong. He just wanted to get through this and not let her go.</p> <p>As it turned out, it was a lot better than he thought it could be. All of the tension she had with him was gone and she was just as beautiful as ever. She was his woman now and she couldn't stay away. He let her be, he would still respect her even if she just cried. They didn't have the strength to go back even if they had to and if she got hurt they would still be friends. He knew now. He had to get her in bed and back into a proper relationship. He didn't think she would go and he didn't know whether he should tell her to go, even if he had some sort of chance of keeping her from leaving. His eyes misted slightly and he didn't want to take her back because he didn't think she was ready to leave. He hadn't even considered what it would be like to be with anyone even her husband.</p> <p>"I don't know," he said softly, "we'll talk. Maybe we can try."</p> <p>"If you feel you have to go, then go, if you don't," she replied.</p> <p>"That's what you said. If you stay in school you can come home. If you come back here I'll help you."
