My fingers tightened and pulled her into me, so tight that I felt myself trying to push even more inside. I felt her begin to move her legs away, so I was able to slide them around. My hips began moving against hers as I felt myself becoming more and more sensitive to her touch, and when I began to rub up and down against her leg, my own excitement built to an even higher level. I was in ecstasy as we rubbed together and felt me thrusting harder and harder against her.</p> <p>Gasping for breath, I held my breath as my orgasm was growing and I felt my knees begin to shake. Lifting my head, I looked at her face and saw the same look in her eyes.</p> <p>I whispered, "I love you and I want to give you more."</p> <p>"Thank you, Sweetheart," She whispered back.</p> <p>"But I don't think it really makes any difference," I was afraid she was going to leave me.</p> <p>She kissed me with her lips and pulled back from me. Taking my hand, she led me back to the room. We went to the bed and quickly moved there and before I could sit down, I had my arms wrapped around her. We kissed again, and I kissed her so deeply, so passionately that our kissing was the most powerful thing we'd ever done. I felt her body begin to quiver as I knew that she was about to cum just from the intensity of her kissing. I felt her legs clamp down around me and she let go of me. I felt her fingers digging into my back as she bit down on my shoulder. Her body began to shiver, and she let out a little cry as she came. I held her close and kissed her, whispering sweet love to her as I held her. We lay together in silence as we just held on to each other. When my breathing calmed down, I looked up at her and we kissed again.</p> <p>We lay there for awhile, our arms sliding around each other. I felt my heart begin to pound a little faster as we moved and I could feel the tears of joy on my face as we kissed so deeply again. At last, she lifted off of me and got on her knees between my legs. My knees were trembling, and feeling her soft, moist, warm hand on my pussy, I felt as if my heart had just jumped out of my chest.</p> <p>Slowly, she began to stroke me through my jeans. She rubbed up and down against me, rubbing her fingertips against my sensitive lips.</p> <p>"Oh, My Sweetheart," She moaned, "I love you more than I've ever loved anyone. You can do anything you want now, just let me know, Sweetheart."</p> <p>"I didn't think I could ever say anything like that, baby," I whispered to her, looking up at her in the softness of her eyes. "No one has ever made me feel this way before."</p> <p>She kissed me gently, then took my hand and slid it down her chest to her breasts. I felt my excitement rise as my fingers grazed her nipples, feeling them stiffen with my touch. Her arms went around my neck, holding me tight to her. She pulled me to her, and we kissed again. My body trembled and became more excited, her lips opening and tasting me. Her lips were so soft as they kissed me, gently, gently, and sweetly.</p> <p>Taking her mouth up from mine, I began to caress her breast, while she stroked and rubbed her own breasts. I felt myself trembling as I slid down her body toward her and watched her face as her lips descended, kissing her, and then down her beautiful body. When she finally moved me between her legs and began to rub her mound through her jeans, she said, "Oh, Darling, Please don't stop, don't ever stop!"</p> <p>I stood up, and leaned down until our mouths met for an impassioned kiss. I could feel the moisture of her body as it began to moisten. I lifted back up, allowing her to pull her lips back to mine and began to kiss her more passionately. When she touched with her tongue, I felt her body quiver and shiver with excitement. Her hips began moving toward the bed as she leaned back, spreading her legs to meet my fingers. Reaching around, I found her pussy and found that she was already dripping with her excitement.</p> <p>I kissed and touched every part of her with my mouth, but never stopped her cries of "Please..." from under my breath. I felt her start to hump against my fingers and I felt her orgasm start. I brought my hand up to caress her clit, feeling the tiny little bud press against the fingers that were still inside her.
