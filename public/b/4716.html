I offered.</p> <p>"Yes, that would give me something to think about," Jenna answered. She took a seat on the edge of my desk, facing me, the book still at her feet. I looked back at my own private collection, where I had taken a good deal of time off of editing several parts of the book. I had spent many a night in my office, my hands often running through all of the pictures, as I wrote in the book, and it was obvious that Jenna and I would both be doing a lot more work for the day, I hoped. I read over the book and saw that it was really quite interesting in a couple of the parts, and I decided that I would give some of Jenna's work a go after I had some lunch. I had also decided that the idea for the book had been coming up over the last several days, which was actually pretty good news, as I could use the time.</p> <p>"That will be fine, I'll buy you lunch, and let you read it for an hour," I said. "Will that be all right?" I was looking out over the valley, looking for the right time to park down toward Mount Royal in the valley.</p> <p>"That sounds great, but I feel like I might need to sit out here a bit. I've been doing some work on building a greenhouse for years, so it's not as neat and tidy as it looks, and the bushes around it are a little overgrown. So, you know where we will be eating at lunch, when you're done reading what is on your plate, while I am doing some work on a greenhouse, right?" she responded.</p> <p>"Of course I'll have a good time, and if we have a nice time, I'll keep you entertained for hours. In fact, I might even help you do that with some of the other plants that I've got growing here," I offered. "But if you don't see that you can't wait to read, then you need to get the plants ready to be washed, or put them in the ground. It's only after we have finished lunch, that we can make some lunch," I said.</p> <p>Jenna had already slid back to her chair and was putting her hand back in the book now, and she was writing in it, again. "I can see you are already enjoying that reading. You have certainly got a new attitude about yourself, even if you didn't before. I'm sure that you found it quite refreshing, as they do with our other students," she said. "So, why don't you get me a beer and we can get started."</p> <p>"I might just do that, but I'm not feeling good right now. Can I use the restroom?" I asked.</p> <p>"Sure," she answered. "That's fine, it's just that I've got to get dinner going." She turned and left, leaving me to finish my own work, and go home to my lovely wife.</p> <p>"I've got to find another way to get done with this book," I muttered. I needed to finish off the gardening, so I took a moment to gather my tools and the books from the desktop computer and went to the bathroom, to take a leak. I found a short walkway and walked it, through the garden where the roses grew. I was only about an hour away from the kitchen, and I knew that the gardening hadn't really been done yet. There would have to wait, however, for I was going to make some lunch if I wanted to do that.</p> <p>On the other side of the garden was a small house with a kitchen, then several tables on a small table. The table that I had just left, was for when I prepared the salad for the vegetables when I was back in the kitchen. As I stepped aside, I felt a warm hand on my shoulder. "You're hungry, can I feed you?" she asked. I was about to protest, but she stopped me. "Don't make too much of a noise," she said. "I'm really hungry. Come on."</p> <p>I went into the kitchen. I knew that the dishes were already in the dishwasher, and, instead of making the salad, I went over to the stove. While I was bent over to put the cutlery next the food, I felt her body press up against me. Her breasts were against my chest as she lifted her hand and gently pushed down on my shoulders, bending me slightly. "I am not going to stop until you are satisfied," she whispered, as she gently pushed me back againstâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
