One hand snaked around to tweak his nipple. "Mmm," she said. They broke the embrace again. "We both have to get to work on Wednesday." She grabbed her bag and left the apartment.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Tuesday morning was a blur of activity. It was a quick lunch break and their conversation had to be brief. But when they finally got up to use the bathroom, she reminded him that he'd left a bottle of water in the room. "We're still going to the club," he said.</p> <p>"I know," she answered. "The bar you got us drinks before I arrived."</p> <p>"Well," he smiled. "We need to get out and have a drink. Come on, I've already fixed our hair."</p> <p>They grabbed a taxi and headed for the club, with John still a little unsure of what to wear. He thought it might've been worth a try, even if just because his body had gone to sleep in the back seat of his car.</p> <p>On their way to the club, they talked about their own lives and about themselves. He'd graduated from a prestigious school; his mother had accepted his offer to go to Yale. "Why did you get a doctorate?" he asked. "I'd been hoping someone like you could graduate. It didn't seem like you had much experience."</p> <p>"I don't know," she said. "My husband was in a job in the Army for a while and he just happened to drop it. You'll see." She looked so much younger that I could see why John was so worried about her.</p> <p>He turned toward a corner booth to get a drink and noticed a new blonde sitting near him. "The blonde chick is very interesting." They chatted for a while, and the two of them ended up on the dance floor. He was surprised at how she held his eyes and how she danced around him.</p> <p>"You're a great dancer," he finally said.</p> <p>"Thank you," she said. "I have a couple of lessons left."</p> <p>"Do you have a sister?" he asked.</p> <p>"No," she laughed. "I'm a young adult and I have a lot of friends." She laughed again and went on to talk about her past. She told him how different she'd gotten when she was younger and how she hated how she was a single parent.</p> <p>They danced and he watched out of the corner of his eye. As their friends kept glancing down at their crotches, she started rubbing against him. She looked up at him and saw the hungry look in his eyes and reached out to rub his hand.</p> <p>"I have a special place a couple of blocks away. Can you show me?" he asked. She nodded.</p> <p>"Can you let me show you? That's something."</p> <p>"I think so," she said. She looked out the window while she held his hand.</p> <p>"There is a door right over there that leads to the bathroom," he said as he led her from the booth.</p> <p>"Let's go," she said, leading him back to the dance floor. As they danced he had to hold the hem of her dress higher than usual and put his hands under her short dress. "My God! It's so warm in here."</p> <p>They moved around a pole and he was able to pull her toward him more closely. Before long, they were grinding and she couldn't stop the moans from coming out of her mouth. He was rubbing his groin against her leg when a man she'd just left waved them over. She put her hand on his chest and pulled her dress up, showing the man she wasn't wearing panties and that he had a hard-on.</p> <p>Her hand fell from his chest and it took only a second for him to unzip his pants. He was amazed at how easily they were able to slide out from under her dress and she turned toward him and put her hand on his bulging crotch. "Do you like what you see?" she asked.</p> <p>"You're such a sexy woman," he said. "Thank you," he replied.</p> <p>"Do you want to go back to your car?" she asked.</p> <p>"I'm going to get a cab later," he said. "That was a lot of fun."</p> <p>He handed her a $20 dollar bill and the two of them went to his car. A few minutes later, the car pulled up and they got out. Her husband opened his door. "Where you going?" he asked.</p> <p>"Just a little walkâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
