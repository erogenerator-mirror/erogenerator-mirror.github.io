Yes! Hard! Fuuuk! Fuuuuuuuuuck!" She screamed and groaned as her hand worked her pussy and she arched up off the bed to meet her finger.</p> <p>"Ughh! Fuck, fuck, fuck!" She finally let loose a low roar as her orgasm rocked through her body. She grabbed both of her nipples between her fingers to try and hold on as her body bucked and her legs tried to get free. She could finally hear him moaning and groaning, she could hear him grunting and he was really pumping into her.</p> <p>"Fuck!"</p> <p>When she had finished, she got up from the bed and headed for the shower.</p> <p>"Don't ever wash that pussy off!"</p> <p>"Never. I hate that ass!"</p> <p>"Nooo! Never. I hate it."</p> <p>"Don't you ever clean that ass or that pussy unless I tell you to. And if you don't, do it by washing your ass yourself." He was looking down at the sight of her in the water and the look in her eyes was enough to make him hard again.</p> <p>"I'll do that."</p> <p>"Please don't. This was an eye opener and I didn't mean anything by it."</p> <p>That was the last thing he would say to her ever again.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>That night, he heard her moaning and groaning again and again. All of a sudden she pushed herself up and grabbed him before he was close to cumming and she threw herself down on the bed.</p> <p>"Please. Fuck me. Fuck me, cum on me, cum on me."</p> <p>He went back over to the bed and climbed in with her. Their chests touched and he could feel her breasts against his chest. She started kissing and touching him back and she had him lying down and she straddled him while still holding his cock. She got a condom out of the drawer that he had taken out before and took it off him. She pushed him out of the way and straddled him with her hand, grabbing his cock and rubbing it along her slit.</p> <p>"Don't tease me," He pushed a finger into her ass, "Fuck me, fuck me. Cum on me, cum in me."</p> <p>"Cum on me!" She lifted herself up and he felt his cock sliding up and down her slit. She took his cock and guided it right to her cunt. She lifted herself and sat back down on his cock. She felt his cock penetrate her and she groaned in pleasure and started moving up and down. He moved one of his hands down to her ass and started squeezing and rubbing her as she began to make her ass move up and down on his cock with her ass. She could feel his cock getting harder as she got ready to cum and she felt it start to swell up and he grabbed her hips and started fucking her as hard as he could. She was moving up and down so fast that it hurt. He was really getting into the fucking she was giving him now and she wanted to keep this for as long as possible. She knew, to her astonishment that if he had not just given in to their urge to cum, he would have blown his load all over her tits and face. When he came for a second time with a grunt and a yell, she stopped moving and just sat there on his cock.</p> <p>"That felt good!" She had to take a couple deep breaths to regain her composure.</p> <p>She started to lift her hips off his cock and she felt it slide out of her. She grabbed it again and laid back on the bed.</p> <p>"I need more. I'm so horny. I can't move."</p> <p>He started to put his robe on and she told him to get back into bed and he was still asleep. She got up and went to the drawer and took a bottle of lube out of it. She took one finger and pushed it in then spread it all over his cock. She knew he would wake and then feel up to when he came, but she also knew he would wake up with her fingers up him. She lubed him up and lubed her ass up until it was ready and he was hard again again. She pulled out the condom and climbed off of him and climbed on the bed next to him. She could still hear him breathing and it made her horny.</p> <p>"Ready?"</p> <p>He just gave the command.</p> <p>She kissed him and climbed down between his legs and leaned over and took his cock into her mouth. She looked at his cock as it lay against her cheek and she licked her own hand clean of his juices. She was going to get him off and she knew it.
