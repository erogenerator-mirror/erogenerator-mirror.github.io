What I do remember is the feeling of her hair on my lips. I know from the feel that, while we've always been comfortable with one another and that we never made a habit of saying 'hi' and not saying anything more, the feeling of hair on my lips always felt slightly like a kiss. The longer our lips touched, the more our breath filled with each other. I could imagine every moment of our kissing; it could have only been one of us. When the time came, I'd get her into a cab. I'd have a light conversation with her just so she could find her way home.</p> <p>The last few days of our relationship were the longest and most difficult one. I couldn't begin to figure out why I couldn't make her feel better. There was that awkward feeling between us that is never easy but every time. I know one thing I can honestly say; I love her. I don't think I've ever loved a woman as much as I was that night in London. I didn't know why I couldn't make her feel good.</p> <p>At first our talk was mundane and superficial. She just seemed lost and I wanted to find a way out. We ended the talk in a way that felt a lot less superficial like it did in our first few days together. There was a sense of familiarity that didn't seem to bother her at all. It was as if we had known each other for years without talking much more than I'd said. The first time we hung out we had a couple of drinks and it didn't bother me a bit at all, it probably helped her.</p> <p>After the party that night we were still talking when our conversation turned to other things. We made sure that our relationship was strictly business. She wouldn't ask how I knew that my job was a porn channel. If it was a good enough job, I didn't care the details. Her answer wasn't a question or a question. The fact that I loved her almost as much as she loved me was the best possible explanation.</p> <p>After the usual awkwardness of our first meeting finally broke down, I wasn't prepared for how quickly everything changed. The past week had certainly been the best of our relationship, or should I say our relationship. Things had really grown together and the two of us were working ourselves towards an agreement that we loved each other. I was finally able to bring that up. During dinner we had a good amount of wine. She wasn't saying much but I could hear the happiness in her voice.</p> <p>By late evening we hadn't said a word to each other or our friends. It wasn't like our friends that had been friends with us in the past. That was mostly it. The only reason we've ever had the awkward conversation was to try to keep from being "taken" away. There was also the fact that she was still feeling guilty about being with another man, although she didn't know it yet. So we both said that we loved each other again before we really got into it.</p> <p>Our relationship continued to be as simple as that. At night time we would spend hours just talking, sometimes late into the night. After that the hours went by much the same. The longer we stayed married the longer she was around me. The more tense she became. But our time together got warmer the more times we were together. Then the time for that was gone. It was a long time before my wife stopped talking to me anymore. Not that she was avoiding me to a degree, of course but I could tell. I didn't want to feel like I was losing her either. It wasn't until our daughter was born that it finally came out to play. We'd gone out that time with her and me wearing something pretty.</p> <p>I loved her, I truly did, but as much fun as that was, I was never the same after that. Our friendship had become more important than the sex between the two of us. I just couldn't bring myself to cheat on my wife. I knew that wouldn't be easy at all. She had to be the one that knew. I didn't want to think about getting too drunk or driving too fast. I really was tired. The day of the party came closer with every sip of wine I drank. Then at 11 pm she finally came into my bedroom. I was really nervous about what I was going to say to her but for once it didn't seem like her at all.</p> <p>Once I had sat up in bed I knew that the situation was pretty bad. We had a lot in common. We were both happily married and both equally in love with other people. I was the one who got all the sex. I was the one that made her feel like I did because of who I was. We had been married since our last child, a boy we both loved and loved everyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
