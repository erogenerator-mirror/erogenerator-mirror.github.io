She smiled a little. He probably didn't even know he was going back to the house again. He was probably having fun.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>Lisette had found a way to not look bored when I arrived for dinner. When I arrived, I found Lisette and Tom were nowhere to be found. I went to the back deck and saw there were no chairs, and no towels anywhere. I was curious to see the people who would go home with me and I went to see if they had towels left. I found out they had gone for cold showers and a quick wash, and everyone was still in the mood for some fun.</p> <p>"Where is she?" I asked.</p> <p>"Oh... I don't know," came a voice from around three feet away from where Tom sat. He was wearing shorts and a tee-shirt and was smiling when he saw me. "I guess I'm in the mood to see what else your friend has."</p> <p>"What do you think she's up to now?" I suggested.</p> <p>"Well... yes," came the response. "Maybe she'll have a good time. Maybe she would like to fuck me."</p> <p>I was a little surprised, because he didn't like to know how to answer a question. There wasn't that good a deal of common sense in it. What was different about 'playing around'? I didn't feel like that. I liked it fun. Maybe she wouldn't like it, but I wasn't a prostitute. I wasn't really interested in how I felt about the man I was with. He wasn't making me feel good about it either. Was I?</p> <p>"Tom," I said, coming towards him. "I'm not sure what else we can share."</p> <p>After this, I saw Tom's smile grow ever wider. "I'll take that as a yes," he said. "That would be very neat," he said as he stood up. "It looks a lot better with towels."</p> <p>Now, in fact, he'd been carrying his clothes to the house. There were a few towels in the laundry hamper that he'd dumped to dry out. "Lees, can someone look into the laundry hamper?"</p> <p>I looked at the hamper. It looked to be a good sized box with some water stains in them. The ones in the closet were still there. "Maybe," I said.</p> <p>"Let's go get something to drink," he suggested.</p> <p>"I'm good," I agreed. "Lets get some supper."</p> <p>"We'll have to call it a cookout and then, maybe, the hot tub, if you really want to." He took me by the hand and led me there.</p> <p>He had picked up beer bottles, so he didn't have to pay to get my drink. I could already imagine the fun he would have had if I had one of his. He put one in front of me and I knew what to do. I leaned over. He took the bottle and we shared them.</p> <p>That first time I had sex, we both had beer so I never had that feeling again, but I definitely needed some more beer. Tom's beer tasted good. He must have had a dozen, too. My dick was starting to become sensitive, and so I took advantage of it and started stroking it.</p> <p>When I moved on top on top of him, he put his arms around my neck and pulled me down onto him. One hand was now playing with my nipple, and the other hand was exploring my face and chest.</p> <p>I leaned into him a little and kissed his lips softly. I hadn't even gotten fully into it back there; it had just happened.</p> <p>"Lise, there's no rush, just come back. I want you right here. I'll be right there." He looked pleased with this.</p> <p>"I just know you're going to be disappointed," I said to him, and kissed him.</p> <p>His eyes were alive with desire and he kissed me back, as our tongues entwined. He took a step back after we stopped kissing and then lifted me up off the lounge chair and stood up, and helped me back to the lounge chair.</p> <p>We sat down for a moment. "Lise," he said. "When I walked into your house earlier, you didn't seem at all upset, but I can see you were. We've both been acting a little weird around each other, that's why. I'm just glad it's finally decided to have someone else there that's going to be on my side. It's going to be really hard for us." He kissed me gently in response to my own kiss, but I wanted all this to be just for himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
