She nodded slowly, smiling against the heat of his blue eyes. "But you've got to help me get her out of here. Now."</p> <p>Sylvia struggled against him weakly as they got to her front door. The cold, metal object was still embedded between her inner thighs the moment his fingers touched it and she could barely move. She tried to move her feet away but found that she couldn't move a muscle. She felt nauseated.</p> <p>"No, don't move," he whispered in her ear. "Just stay there. Don't let go, Sylvia. I'll get her."</p> <p>He pushed the plug deeper in her body. Sylvia cried out when he pulled it up, tearing the ring from her skin. She screamed when he took it out and held it back.</p> <p>"I told you don't move," He rasped. "Don't scream, okay?"</p> <p>Sylvia shook her head. "I-I think I'm sick."</p> <p>"You'll die." He said, then shoved her forward. Sylvia struggled against him again, but to no avail.</p> <p>"Don't," he growled and she saw the dark shadow he cast before him. She saw the man who held her body to the floor. She saw him holding the thing inside of her in the face, just to be inside the darkness. She heard him gasp as she felt the thing inside of her. They were both silent for a long moment. "Let go."</p> <p>"What is it?" Sylvia asked.</p> <p>She reached up at last, pulling on the chain that held her breasts firmly in front of her chest, the rough links giving her chills of their sharp grip. "It's my clitoris."</p> <p>"Oh." He rubbed her shoulders, his eyes fixed on hers.</p> <p>She bit her lip, trying to keep the noise down. "I think I've found a way to make it even more exciting for her."</p> <p>"I'll take that as a compliment."</p> <p>"What?" She gasped, her voice cracking as she fought to make her voice rise.</p> <p>"Just let go and she'll be all right, now. Let me look at her." He stroked her face, feeling the smoothness of her skin beneath his fingertips as he spoke.</p> <p>"Oh, don't stop. Keep going."</p> <p>"This thing?"</p> <p>"Yes, it's the thing where the human body is made from something. It's the same thing as yours, only that it's made out of metal; a long, straight line. It gets deeper inside you just by being alive, though. It's the kind of clitoris that the vagina is made out of. It's much stronger than the vagina's, and when it's inside, there's a strong pull inside you."</p> <p>Sylvia let loose a strangled moan. "Now what are you on about?"</p> <p>"Well, I think that it would be a much more exciting experience for me to see what happens inside of her." He stroked her face again, leaving a warm trail from her lips down to her clit.</p> <p>"How is it that you feel so alive in there?" She asked him, her voice muffled by the rough links.</p> <p>"It feels as if you're floating inside of her," he said. "It feels as if she's floating inside of me."</p> <p>Sylvia's breath came in gasps as she stared back at him, eyes wide as she tried to pull away. She struggled when the chains tightened again, the metal sticking out of her skin.</p> <p>"Don't worry," he murmured and she felt him move, pushing her down by her shoulders. "You can trust him. You can trust him. Now let go. And let go. I want to see how far it goes inside you."</p> <p>"I guess I'll get the benefit of it." Sylvia said as she gave herself away.</p> <p>When Sylvia gave it away, he pushed through the chains and lifted the woman's legs apart above him. She gasped as he slipped his cock into her, feeling like an intruder with his cock inside of her.</p> <p>"There, that wasn't so bad did it?" She watched as he reached forward and touched her stomach, touching the underside of her breasts with his fingers just as his cock drove into her body. She felt as if all air was stuck inside her body in that instant. Then, he pulled back, and she felt as if she were on some sort of raft, suspended above a huge rock. Like a float, she could feel herself falling on its icy surface.</p> <p>"That's how things are," He said in aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
