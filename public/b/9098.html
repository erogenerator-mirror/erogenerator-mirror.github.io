My lips moved gently across her shoulder and the edge of her ear. I could already smell the perfume she was wearing.</p> <p>She let go of one hip with one hand and put both hands on my chest. There was an extra sway to her hips, her back was pushing into me; a slow, sexy sway as her body moved against mine. My hands reached down from her waistline to find her skirt. I slid my hands over her hips and down to the hem at her ankles and lifted it up, letting it slip down her legs to the floor.</p> <p>She stepped out of it and the skirt fell to just above her knees. When she was fully dressed, I knelt in front of her and began caressing her thighs where I knew her pubic hair to be.</p> <p>She turned to me and slowly turned her back toward me.</p> <p>With her back to me, she placed one hand in my lap, pressing my erection against my khakis. The other hand slowly slid up her side, caressing, moving from breast to breast. She let out a quiet gasp when I put my hand on her stomach and moved it up through her hair. She let out a soft moan, then lowered her hand again, sliding it up and around my zipper.</p> <p>I slid my hand across her hip and slid it under her shirt, feeling the warm skin. Her hands were already moving her shirt off. She slid it from her body and turned to face me.</p> <p>She pulled me down to her and we kissed passionately. Her tongue pushed into my mouth. I wrapped one arm around her hips and caressed her ass. My hand ran down her thighs and I found her slit, sliding a finger in. Her lips parted, I moved in to kiss her again, then she pulled my shirt off. I stood up in front of her, caressing her arms and neck. I cupped her breast and rolled her nipple in between my thumb and finger, while pushing down at her belly, she leaned forward, opening her legs. I slid my hands down to the top of her calves, her knees and began exploring every inch of her skin with my touch.</p> <p>When I reached her knee, I used the tips of my fingers to trace her lips. She parted them and I began moving back up to her earlobe. I pushed a finger inside her and slipped it out.</p> <p>She lifted her hips and I let it slide out with a "choo" as I pressed her back again. She held my fingers in position and let them glide as my thumb slid back down her lips.</p> <p>She let out a gasp "Oh, that's awesome".</p> <p>"This is so good."</p> <p>She spread her legs farther apart. Her head came down as she turned to kiss me. Our tongues found each other and the kiss went on and on. I placed my hand on her hip and slid it up to cup her breast.</p> <p>"You are so wet."</p> <p>"I can feel." she replied. "I'm already pretty wet at this point."</p> <p>She reached down between us and grabbed my erection. I wanted to touch her so desperately but couldn't. She rubbed my cock in a circular movement, her index finger coming to rest on my balls. She began to rub and squeeze, sliding over them and down to the base.</p> <p>My hands moved to her back, pulling her close and letting her hair out of my grip while we kissed. Our tongues dueled and explored each other, until I cupped her breast, pinching her nipple. My hand kept moving against her hip, slowly circling her with the pad of my thumb, as she rubbed my cock. When she had me close, she slowly moved downward, her tongue tracing the sensitive tip. She cupped my balls and rolled my nipples with her fingers, before running her tongue down my chest.</p> <p>My hand continued to stroke her hair as she made her way downward. My hand came around her waist. It found a firm round buttock as her hand found my ass cheeks. She pushed her lips down my body and into my pelvis, her tongue sliding back and forth, pressing her lips over the head of my cock. The kiss got deeper until her lips were brushing the bottom of my cock, while her lips moved to kiss around the head.</p> <p>I pushed the head of my cock into her face, then back. She pressed my shaft down and I was able to hold back my orgasm, instead letting myself simmer in preparation. I held back as long as I could, then Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
