That's why I came. This is so fucking hot, you fucking pervert I need to fuck you!"</p> <p>"No..." I stuttered, "this is what I'll love you to do, your dirty little kinky mouth and the pervy hot pussy that it has to be! And I am going to love it!"</p> <p>Her tongue shot out again, flicked against her clit, and that was all it took. Her breathing was getting heavier. My cock got harder. My hips thrust forward, feeling the heat coming off of her body, which seemed to intensify, as she got hotter and hotter. It seemed like she might let out an orgasm and release it all onto my throbbing erection.</p> <p>"Oh, fuck! Yes! Yes!! Yes, yes, yes!! Oh, shit, oh my God! Yesss! Yes!"</p> <p>I didn't want to go. I didn't want to give her what she needed. She was on such a high that I couldn't control the need to shoot off in that tight little wet pussy of hers. She was right on the edge now, with me sitting down as my hips thrust into her. The heat inside her went off in waves. Her legs were straining together, and the pressure of her body on me was incredible. With every thrust in and out of her, she got louder and louder. I could feel the pressure building, I knew from her grunts and screams how close she was, and I was getting close to unloading in that sweet pussy.</p> <p>"Oh, no! God, no! I can't...oh, fuck I'm coming...!" I heard her cry as she began to shudder and shudder violently. Her head flopped on my arm. Her breathing was getting labored, as she fought hard to stay on her feet. Her ass was clenching. She was going wild, I grabbed her, held her, and rode it out until she started to calm down, and she pulled herself onto me, breathing again and letting her whole body relax.</p> <p>She said, "Thank you."</p> <p>"So you are my dirty little whore, aren't you?"</p> <p>"I am! Yes-I love you so fucking much!"</p> <p>"I loved watching you, fucking your ass for me!"</p> <p>"I love you too! I'm so horny! You are so much bigger than your ex!"</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess I am just a little bigger than he is," she thoughtfully said.</p> <p>"I can tell. He might fuck a woman like me," I added.</p> <p>She smiled, "If he had, I would let him...I'd fuck that pussy, I'd let him fuck your ass!"</p> <p>"Well, that would be nice, right?" I smiled.</p> <p>"It is." I thought. I was so comfortable with her. I felt like a total nerd, as I had the time with a girl I was dating. The pressure of our friendship was just too much to resist. I leaned over and kissed her. She felt so warm and sexy that I got wet again. She responded by pressing against me. I pulled her back hard onto me and she melted in my arms.</p> <p>"We shouldn't be doing this," she said.</p> <p>"It's okay," I replied. "We don't have to feel like we aren't really doing anything."</p> <p>"No, it's not that at all," she replied. I felt her heart beating on my chest like that on the inside of her cheek, so I turned her to her back. I pushed her up onto all fours on the bed. I moved over her body, so my cock was right at her pussy, and I pushed it all the way inside. It felt like I was going in her all the way but I was just right. She didn't have to feel like I was going fast and hard. I started to get a rhythm going, with my cock still completely inside of her. I could feel one of her soft hands rubbing herself. She leaned her head to one side, kissing her neck, which made it easy. I loved the way her hot breath washed over my cock. It also turned me on so much. I leaned over all the way down between her legs and started to suck on her nipples, which seemed to take the cake.</p> <p>She began to moan. She moved one hand down to touch her clit. Her hand came away slick and wet, as she rubbed it. The feeling of her fingers on her clit was incredibly hot. Her eyes were closed. I could tell she was thinking about the idea of doing me do the same to her. I thought I would make her do it to herself, to a whole new level.
