I can't be the first woman... and you know..."</p> <p>I smiled at her and kissed her on the lips again. This time our tongues touched. The feeling was electric. We both wanted more. I didn't care about it at the moment because we didn't need to speak of it.</p> <p>She broke our kiss and broke her own hold on me. I smiled at her to thank her before leaning in again and kissing her passionately. The feeling of our hands on the other hand was indescribable. When I could take any more, we parted to take another walk in the cool night air.</p> <p>"I love you," I whispered to her as we walked together to my hotel.</p> <p>"I love you too," she whispered back before closing the door to our room and locking it again.</p> <p>We walked back to the hotel room and I stood there and stared into her eyes. I knew I was in love. There was no way she was going to cheat on me and I could not ask her to do it. I had to take her back and find out what she had doneâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
