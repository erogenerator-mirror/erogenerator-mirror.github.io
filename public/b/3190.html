Come with me. I want you to feel like you could enjoy this if you don't stop yourself from doing it."</p> <p>Her head tilted up against his shoulder and her eyes were fixed on to his cock. She wanted him inside her, desperately needing to feel him, her insides were on fire to the point of being in danger of exploding. He watched as the fear and shame was all hers to see.</p> <p>"Come on slut. You're not going to regret this. I want you to give me that little sweet pussy."</p> <p>"Oh yes. Just don't stop. Oh god, please don't stop."</p> <p>Leaning forward, he moved her arms from her wrists and let them hang limply on the arm of the chair. He watched as her fingers slid down along her chest and her fingers pinched her nipples. She wanted to touch herself. He was watching her, watching the pleasure that raced through her. She slid both hands down her stomach, spreading her legs and sliding her fingers along her pussy. She slipped two fingers into herself, drawing a moan from deep within her. He watched, his cock growing harder. He moved into position behind her on the couch and leaned toward her, sliding his cock along her lips with one hand. She spread herself like the cat she was and took him in, moaning. She felt him against her, wet, hard. She wanted to be him. It was like he was her, a fantasy that she had never told people about before. The thrill of being dominated by another woman. She leaned back against the softness of the couch, feeling him behind her.</p> <p>"Are you ready to be fucked now? Are you ready to let me fuck you?"</p> <p>She felt him move against her and could feel his hardness against her flesh. It was almost too much. She was already on the edge. She wanted him in her. She wanted him inside her. He was there, she felt him inside her. She felt the hardness of him there. She could feel every ridge and every vein and the heat of him. It was like he was alive, like she was in his body, all of it.</p> <p>"Yes, please," her voice was weak and hoarse. "I am yours. I want it. I want to feel you."</p> <p>He moved away from her and moved toward the couch. "Sit down on the floor," he said, motioning toward her. She moved to do so, straddling the couch, leaning back and arching her back. "Bend over the couch." She lay down on the sofa, her ass pointed toward him. He moved forward and stood beside her. She watched his cock as it moved like a snake to where it was aimed at her open wetness. It was a head. A purple helmet, throbbing. She felt her breath catch.</p> <p>"Look at how wet I am whore. I want you to play with yourself while I fuck you." He pushed in, not moving, his fingers gripping her hips. "I want to feel you cum in my big hard cock. I want to make you feel like I owned your body."</p> <p>She felt so full. Her legs were pressed up against her chest as he entered her. She couldn't see much, just the base of his cock pushing up against her pussy lips to the other part of her pussy. She could barely make out the head of the cock as it spread her folds, the pink head of his cock emerging up her tunnel and out again into her belly. He leaned forward, his legs between hers and bent one knee toward her to pull her closer to him. She felt his cock against her, as it pushed against the outside of her pussy and the inner lips of her pussy on the underside of her ass.</p> <p>"God, don't make me cum right now. Just fuck me harder," she begged.</p> <p>"No, you don't want my cock in you cunt?" he asked. "You want my cock to make you cum. You want it deep. Don't you want me to make YOU cum?"</p> <p>"Yes!" she exclaimed as the words sank in.</p> <p>"No," he whispered. "No, you want my cock. You want it in you. You want my cock to make you cum and cum around my cock."</p> <p>"Oh god. Yes. I don't know how to make me cum with my husband fucking me. But I don't care that much."</p> <p>He slowly pulled out of her pussy, leaving her dripping with sex juices, leaving a thin sheen that ran down the entire length of his shaft. She felt as if she were leaving her body. The head slipped back out of her cunt, the wet flesh as it rolled across her sensitive flesh.
