We went into the next room and the guy told us to just start at my dick. As he talked he ran his fingers over my hard dick. He really did seem to know what he was doing. I think he knew that I could get into this any time I wanted to.</p> <p>'I guess I could give her a ride to the next room,' I said. He just smiled. We walked back to the living room and just the thought that he might be seeing my dick in all its glory excited me. But instead of the next room all I was looking at was the large hole in the wall that went from her room down to my dick. I was so tempted to see her dick at the other end.</p> <p>The next room was different so I stopped in front of the hole in the wall. It was a small one. But the walls were hard wood and I wondered if it might be worth letting them know the place. I could see a man coming in and was surprised that he looked familiar. And it didn't matter anyway that he was from the US and had come here to fuck. Then he said something to me that made my dick jump. 'Do you want to come up and see my pussy,' he asked.</p> <p>I nodded. 'Okay.' Then he said, 'I think it is now or never. Don't worry about it. I wouldn't do anything that you weren't willing to try. Now you just follow me.' he handed me the key. My dick was bouncing on the floor. She had to lean against the hole to get even with me. By the time we got to the living room I decided that I had to see if she was as good as she looks.</p> <p>When I got down on the floor I was pretty amazed. It was huge. It was at least 7 inches on top. Just a large, hard cock with a large, large head. I couldn't believe my eyes. I couldn't imagine how it would feel like to have all that man meat in me. I reached up against that wall and touched the hole. It felt hard too. The other wall. That must have been there.</p> <p>He took his cock in his hand and slowly, oh so slowly he slid it inside me. I knew then that I had to have him inside me. I wanted him inside of me and now I had to have him right there. This thing, this guy, my man, it was enormous. He was bigger than the rest of me and as long. It felt like I was still on one side, but closer to him. I was shaking. I really needed to feel some more of him inside me. I wanted to feel everything inside of me. Like someone had made a huge, soft bed instead of a wall. It didn't matter. My mind was spinning.</p> <p>He kissed me. We kissed long and deep. He moved his hands down my face and rested them on my chest. He was moving them slowly down to my erect nipples. I was so close that his cock was brushing up against me. And as I got closer, I felt the same way. It felt like a firework going off inside me. In one, tiny motion. As he slid down a little more my cock disappeared between his lips. I looked down at him. He could almost see every detail of me that he could. His face looked a little strange. He was moving his mouth down slowly. It was just so slow. With every breath he took, his tongue would meet my mushroom head. All the way down he went until his lips locked around the hole just below it and it went still. I could feel it pulsating inside of me. Then he stopped so you could just feel the muscles in my ass and then started all over again. It lasted forever. Then he looked up to me and said something that drove all the air from my lungs. 'I want to fuck you,' he said. We kissed again. His cock was so much harder now. I couldn't believe I was saying the words that I said with them. I just nodded my head and he started moving it in a circle in and out of my ass.</p> <p>With each stroke I could feel his cock getting bigger and it was pushing the walls of my ass further. It seemed like he had a steel head. He didn't seem to mind. I was just waiting for him to give up. But he didn't give up. He took a few more strokes and held it there. He looked into my eyes, smiled and then pulled it out of me again. He grabbed his dick and it was so hard that I thought it would snap his head off with force.</p> <p>Again and again he pulled it out of me, but the same as before. The head seemed much different from the rest of me. He was longer and a little firmer. It felt like the head of his cock wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
