He felt a small cut on his left nipple as she pulled him towards her. He moaned on pain as her lips brushed against his.</p> <p>"Oh my god, that hurts," he cried out.</p> <p>As her lips moved down to kiss his stomach he could feel something wet and warm at his crotch, his cock throbbed as she rubbed herself down over it, making the tip twitch as the heat grew at his body.</p> <p>"I'm going now, you want me to stop just before I cum in your mouth, I do need to cum first."</p> <p>"No, I'm not doing that," he whined as she moved her lips on to his shaft.</p> <p>"Sorry."</p> <p>He moaned as she moved a finger over his slit. His cock started to throb as her finger moved inside, feeling the wet warmth of her pussy as it slid in and out of him. He moaned on her skin as she moved down over his shaft. He felt her tongue on his balls as she moved up closer to him. She was moving her body towards his, his hands were still on the chair. Her body was pressing him down on the chair as she lowered herself over his hardness.</p> <p>"Oh god, you are so bad," he cried out.</p> <p>"I only want you inside of me, I just want to feel you inside of me," she whispered. Her body was over him as she pushed down over him.</p> <p>"I'm not going to make love to you, it doesn't ever feel this way anymore," he moaned.</p> <p>"What do you mean it's never feel this way again?" she asked as she continued to move up and down on his hardness, pushing him as deep inside of her as she could. She pushed him so hard he was lifting her off while she screamed at the top of her lungs.</p> <p>"N-o-o-o-o-o-w," he screamed as she bounced up and down on top of him, both of them crying out with pain. He was starting to tremble as he felt her pussy muscles tighten around him. She pushed herself down further as both of them came down off the chair. Feeling herself sliding down on her lower body as she was coming down, her breasts were bouncing so delightfully as she went on. She could see the look in his eyes as his cock jumped up as it was finally released.</p> <p>"Oh god," he whimpered as he felt his seed filling her pussy.</p> <p>"Not yet, we have to get back to the party. Your clothes are in the dryer, take them to the clothes room," she said as she moved herself up him.</p> <p>"N-o-o-o-o," he moaned as he pulled his clothes off. He was shaking with the pain from his ribs.</p> <p>"I'll be back in a minute," he said as he rushed down the stairs.</p> <p>When he reached the clothes room he saw that there was clothes to wear, he walked into the dryer and grabbed them from the dryer. He felt his cock stir in excitement, thinking of what he had once dreamed about when they were in his room at the wedding. He grabbed his gown off of the washer and walked back to her. He tossed it on the bed as he looked at the clothes she had discarded for him to wear.</p> <p>"You've already brought me one, get dressed and be ready to go," he said as he walked towards her with the same clothes he brought over.</p> <p>"I don't have clothes to wear," she said as she pulled on the robe.</p> <p>"I won't be going to the party again until I get back to the house," he said as he tossed on the robe on the bed.</p> <p>"Where is your clothes?" she asked.</p> <p>"They were in the dryer," he lied.</p> <p>"Let me see," he said as he took the towel around him and walked out of the room.</p> <p>When she turned around he saw her standing there, the robe a little loose. He watched her as she pulled it tighter around herself. He was almost disappointed that he hadn't come. He still didn't want her to see the erection he had.</p> <p>"Are you going to be nice to me?" she asked.</p> <p>"Of course, I wanted to say that I'm sorry but I couldn't."</p> <p>"You don't have to apologize, if you want to," she said as she walked towards him.</p> <p>He closed his eyes and tried to think of something else but found that he couldn't. He closed his eyes again.</p> <p>With her now holding his handsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
