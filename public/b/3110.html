I took off my blouse and my bra, sitting down on the armchair on it - my breasts were bouncing freely as I unclamped my breasts and held them in my bra. I slid my fingers over the lace of my white panties, and ran them over my shaved pussylips. Suddenly, I felt the warmth of my pussy juices! I slipped first one then another finger inside my pussy, then added a second finger. Then, I went back to my clitoris (and it was starting to run along the outer lips!) and rubbed it, in circles, as I continued to finger myself on the couch - my juices were running all over my fingers.</p> <p>I stood up - my breasts seemed to be aching and I needed to pee, so I pulled my knickers down to mid-thigh. I bent with my legs slightly apart and pulled my panties down to bare my vulva to the air. I went and picked them up and threw them in to a little corner of the room so the panties were soaked - I didn't know what would happen now. I stood up and bent over, pushing my bum in the air and sticking my pussy in the air - they were wet and so tight they were almost transparent. I took the panties and put them in my handbag and walked over to my bathroom.</p> <p>When I stepped in, it was still warm and I felt very dirty and horny in a strange way. Suddenly I felt like I should be doing something really dirty - for the first time that evening I realised I had got a lot of good old pictures of myself - from school pictures - showing my tight, pert little bum, from one of the boys.</p> <p>I just stood there, naked to the waist, a big bulge in my belly, my belly button almost poking out in to the front, feeling very vulnerable and vulnerable - I felt like I was in a big, sexual predator situation - having to protect myself - had to obey. I couldn't believe I was doing this - doing what I was doing, and even worse, what I wanted to do. But I knew what I wanted. My body and mind were both ready to obey me - ready but not ready.</p> <p>When I got back to my room, I turned round and looked in my vanity mirror. I looked at my long legs and long legs - all shiny; so shiny I didn't even know I had it to go with my hair down! I knew it to be a wig - longish with two pigtails and very shiny. I was so in the mood to try dressing myself - I needed both these things. I grabbed the wig from the wall and stepped into it and went to the bathroom to put it on.</p> <p>When I arrived back in my room, my clothes still in my handbag, I looked at myself - my face was only the colour of my body. How had I done it? Where had my confidence gone? So did my mind. I felt excited - the power of the power - the power of my sexuality and self.</p> <p>I dressed myself in my new bra and knickers, but left the rest on. I put some stockings on and a black skirt, it was just as sexy as I had remembered. I looked like a girl going to a fashion show - a little less slutty.</p> <p>"What do you think you are doing?" I asked myself.</p> <p>I didn't know. I felt like a schoolgirl, or maybe a guy - and I hadn't even put on a bra, so I didn't remember it being there. Maybe I had just forgotten how good it felt - the pressure was starting to come on from inside me. It was starting to go on again and I felt it. I felt it in my stomach, deep in my bones - I felt my whole body tensing up.</p> <p>I took a deep breath and walked back to my wardrobe where I kept my new panties and started putting the other one on when the doorbell rang. It was a boy - well older than me.</p> <p>"Can I come in?" I asked.</p> <p>"Sure," he said, "if you want to."</p> <p>"Thanks!" I said, "I'm not very big on perfume."</p> <p>"Oh, come on - it'll be great!" I said, "Can I buy you some wine?</p> <p>"Oh, don't worry about it," he said, "it is OK."</p> <p>He looked really disappointed, "I would love some water ... it's OK."</p> <p>"Thanks," I said, "but I'm fine and you can get me another glass of wine if you like."</p> <p>When I asked him if I could get him a bottle, he said, "Sure. Anything."</p> <p>He opened the door and walked round to the back of me. He put both glass and bottle on the stand beside me and lifted me in his armsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
