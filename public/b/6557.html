She stood up and offered me a hand, which I gladly accepted. She led me through a couple of corridors, stopping at a large door in a different part of the building. I looked questioningly into the woman's eyes.</p> <p>'I want you to meet my husband, Roger. He'll be our next door neighbour for the next ten days and I think that it might help to have a second wife.' With that, she ushered me out of the building and up to one of the rooms. The door I rang closed behind me just before I left. I was now alone with my new Mistress.</p> <p>The room I was now in was the same as before, all made of dark wood and the same colouring, but this time it was much better. There were different types of restraints, there were different types of ropes, and there were different types of paddles and clips. I began by going first to an armchair before turning to my knees and laying my head in a cushion. My knees immediately began to ache a little, which made me feel slightly uncomfortable. But this didn't really seem to matter; I was already tied to this chair, so I decided to enjoy the feel of the wood until the evening was over and then do as I pleased. But first I needed some other items...</p> <p>Mistress Rebecca sat quietly by my side, putting a blindfold on me and arranging my restraints at the corners of the chair. From there, Mistress Rebecca started to undo her top and bra in front of me. It hung loosely on her shoulders just below the swell of her breasts. Then I sensed that there was a small chain connecting her breasts, which Mistress Rebecca attached to the collar around my neck. The chain was long, extending down several inches, but was not as thick as my wrists, and it did not actually have a front of either side of the neck. My mistress untied me and led me to the chair, which Mistress Rebecca had set up a few minutes before. As she sat beside the back of the chair, I felt her pull on my restraints with a quick flick to the middle of each arm, which caused a slight pain I was not quite prepared for, but not unpleasant either.</p> <p>'Very nice,' said Mistress Rebecca in a soft voice that came through as she leaned towards me, 'but what would this be that you were so worried about, little girl?' She reached out and started to gently stroke my exposed nipples.</p> <p>'My panties,' I replied, not really sure of who I was talking with.</p> <p>'Good girl. You didn't feel that there were anything else you could find, did you?' Her hand continued to toy with my nipples, tweaking them quite gently and sending pleasant feelings of pleasure through my body. 'If I'm really honest. They're very, very sexy. But they're my husband's that I'm going to enjoy wearing.' With that, I felt Mistress Rebecca raise my bottom and lift the crotch of my panties up. I could feel the light touch of the fabric against my skin as she tugged on them, and after only a few moments of this, I was feeling the moisture of my desire. The fabric was moist and smooth, and I felt it rub against my clit as my Mistress continued a gentle stroking of my breasts, alternating between the soft mounds of flesh and the nipples.</p> <p>'My hubby can be in a state of distraction when I wear them, my dear. But he's not yet so you'll find out soon enough.' Mistress Rebecca leaned over to where I could now feel the heat from Mistress Rebecca's body as Mistress Rebecca held one breast in her hand and the other one in her mouth. She began to pinch my nipples again with the soft touch of her mouth as she continued the steady and gentle stroking of my body. Her hand began to travel lower along my stomach and I suddenly felt her fingertips run the length of my pussy and tease me between my legs. I was very wet, and Mistress Rebecca was obviously pleased with my readiness.</p> <p>'You should've seen yourself when you dressed,' she said with a smile, 'you looked stunningly sexy in that outfit.'</p> <p>I felt Mistress Rebecca lean down. A moment later I felt my skirt being raised up to reveal Mistress Rebecca's own, and it was only in that moment that I felt what the strap-on I had held in my hand was doing to me. It was also doing it to it, and I shivered with excitement at the thought that I could be used by another woman, and be taken so easily. The plastic phallus was being applied to me at an incredible speed, and I could feel my hips jerk as the device touched me. Mistress Rebecca was kneeling by my left side, her hands clasped loosely in the back of the chair, asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
