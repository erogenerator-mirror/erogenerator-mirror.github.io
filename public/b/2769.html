We went to pick the names out of our shopping list while the building manager got the name out of the meeting in a folder.</p> <p>The name for the building was called "City House." In the meeting I read over the specifications of the building, which was built as a commercial office/office on the north side of the city. The number of buildings on the north side was also listed. The site was built to have another park area on the east side of the building. During that trip I found this all too common, because several others had to be built in the same location. A number of locations were built in different sections of the city. I then went to the number one location. I had written over the final list, along with the description of the location.</p> <p>The name of the location would actually be used in many legal matters, but I had to write it over the property, to do so. I went back to the list and picked this city. After the meeting we were given a number to follow to make sure that we were a priority. The name of the city was also listed.</p> <p>When we got back to my apartment, my mom asked me to try and help her with some small shopping the next day. She could give me a list of names to make the list of things I wanted to do to the building on Monday.</p> <p>We spent the next two hours in the store and took the time it took to buy a bunch of things. I told my mom that I should get a bigger desk, which really meant something smaller. This made me happy.</p> <p>After I got a list of names printed on paper it was lunch time in the store. I wanted to do some shopping in the area before we went home because I was hungry. There was no way that I could eat a sandwich in a half hour. So I ate lunch without eating anything else and went back to the apartment. Around 4:30 PM I went to the store to make sure that I had a good time and also took time to pick out the items I could buy. I bought a variety of things.</p> <p>I also picked up a couple of things that I might want to try, and also gave myself a little time to shave. When I went to bed the phone rang. It was the new guy. So I answered it and the guy said that he would like to come up and stay the weekend. He asked me to bring my laptop, because I did not have a laptop with me. I thanked him for the visit and hung up.</p> <p>After the call I was just about to go to bed. When I got home I logged into my laptop and found the name "Cindy" and went right to work.</p> <p>When I got up to the apartment I had put down a couple of boxes and opened the door. I saw a package on the ground. I got up and brought it back to my laptop. From the package I opened it and found a number. "Cindy" was written on the box, at the address on the box.</p> <p>After I opened the box I found a couple of dozen pictures of both my wife and her daughter. There was a wedding picture of Kathy, my daughter, and me. However, on the other side of the pictures, was another picture.</p> <p>As I began to read the picture, I decided to go with, "My wife looks so beautiful tonight"</p> <p>I picked out the picture and clicked the photo, while thinking "I do not think I can be jealous. I am here with her. My daughter is with her. Her looks would make me jealous. What happens in my life when she asks another man to do something to her, then she asks him?"</p> <p>After that photo I picked up the picture and sent the picture to Kathy. I wondered how much she would have to offer me to make me happy.</p> <p>When I got home, Kathy was not there. When I got home, as I suspected, she had gone shopping again. I made a dinner of some Chinese I had made. The smell of the food reminded me of the soup she used to make. I ate quickly. I did not have any questions other than my question about who might be in town on business, which I answered.</p> <p>The next day I decided to have a shower. After washing off the food I called Kathy and asked if she would like to go to the store after work. She agreed.</p> <p>When we got home Kathy was a little tipsy, but she had a good time. We got out of the shower and proceeded to the kitchen. I was so embarrassed to be seen with her. While Kathy was cooking I had a very difficult time deciding if I should get undressed or not. I did not have a lot of options but I gotâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
