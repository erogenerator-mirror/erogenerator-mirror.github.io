"What?"</p> <p>"What do you mean what?"</p> <p>"You asked me to call the cops on you." I said, leaning my head back down to give him a quick kiss.</p> <p>"But that's not how this is supposed to happen, it's supposed to happen." He said with a grin.</p> <p>"Just don't do anything like I did so far." I said in response to his grin.</p> <p>When he looked back at me, he was holding my hand, and looked very serious. "You're serious right now aren't you?" He said, squeezing my hand back.</p> <p>I leaned my head back, "I am."</p> <p>When I felt his hand squeeze my one more time, it was almost painful. "It's just...I don't know how we want to get any closer to where it is. I can't promise you what it is, but I think that it should be a quickie." He said, then took my right hand again.</p> <p>"I know. I've been around enough this...long enough." I said, smiling at him.</p> <p>"I've got you, and I think we'll have a lot more time for you to enjoy. Besides, I was hoping it would be a quickie." He said with a wink.</p> <p>"Well, I have my fingers where they are now." I said.</p> <p>"Is that right?" he asked.</p> <p>"Very." I said with a smile. "I think I'll have to get over there."</p> <p>"What do you mean? Are you trying to get your fingers in a wet one?" He asked.</p> <p>"Uh, no. It's just...I've never done it before, and that's not what I need to experience." I said, my eyes half-closed.</p> <p>"Okay." He said. "You want me to just hold your hand?"</p> <p>I nodded, giving him a mischievous smile. "You better." I said.</p> <p>"I think that I'll go the extra mile." He said, and slid his hand out from the pocket of my jeans. He pulled out two long, square, black-capped silver dollars and presented me with the bills. "So, you're getting off, I think you should hold this." He said, handing me the money.</p> <p>I nodded. "Okay, but I need to get moving, so I may as well do the rest of it myself." I said, smiling back at him again.</p> <p>"Just let me hold one other hand." He said, giving me the money. "That should give you that hand all you want." He said, then stood up to make his way outside to his car. I followed, now fully naked with him. As we approached my car, I couldn't help but wonder what would happen next. I didn't have the heart to ask him what he meant. He had already given me the money, so to speak.</p> <p>When we reached the truck, I looked around to see who I was still in the parking lot, and saw our neighbor sitting on the porch. Her eyes were wide as she stared directly at us. I walked over to him, and gave him a hug that caused my breasts to push against his chest. His arms came up around me and his chin came to rest on my shoulder. I leaned into him and put his lips once more on mine. I was in heaven. I felt so close to him again. Our kiss was soft, with a little passion at the first. I was so far gone, that I hadn't had a woman in my arms other than my own in nearly a decade. I was so lucky to have him.</p> <p>We broke apart, still in our embrace. When he looked at me again, I saw a pained look rise in his face. I leaned down and kissed him so softly, his hands were resting on my shoulders as my head moved from side to side. I had never been kissed like this before, and I almost went out of my mind with pleasure. I held his head in both hands, and gave him all I could. I even kissed him like I knew he liked.</p> <p>When our heartbeats were all but gone, I reached up to his face, and gave him a quick kiss. "Are you ready to go again already? You seem to have all you're getting, so let's go."</p> <p>"I think I'm still a little fuzzy." He said. "So it's like we're just friends again."</p> <p>"Hey, who says I'm just friends? I mean, you're my roommate, so I figure it would be all right." I said, laughing.</p> <p>"I guess we just have to be friendsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
