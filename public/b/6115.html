I felt so embarrassed, but he didn't seem to care. Then, to my horror my arousal was starting to come back up. "And, um, I might just be, uh... you know, too far-up..." a little flustered, I struggled to say.</p> <p>He laughed at me again. "Oh, look," he said, "here we go. It is just like I said! How about we start a little at the beginning and see how things go? Now that we've taken your mind off of it, what else is there?"</p> <p>We had an hour and a half of conversation. We had sex, sex, sex, sex. I felt I couldn't ever leave him, not ever again. I was his, but I couldn't leave the city of Miami with him.</p> <p>That night we did it several times. We fucked each other with a strap-on harness, which I've called a "butt-plug," which was big enough to actually fit it in my ass, which is another thing that I was told to wear at a wedding. Once, that was the first time a man with a cock that was bigger than my husbands got inside me. It hurt at first, but then I just got used to it. I'd had other women who'd really had enough, but he had taken over my life so quickly in so very little time. I felt incredibly self-conscious, my own personal best ever. I felt used like a piece of meat, and nothing else.</p> <p>And, finally, our sex was fantastic. It was perfect. I couldn't help feeling like I had the first time I let a man fuck me. I guess that's why I did what I did with other women. I felt really self-reliant but not necessarily that way. After several months of us going steady, after all, it might seem like we should have been friends. It had been a long time since I had done anything with or for another man.</p> <p>But, we were in a city with no one, no one to turn to, so it was like we were both living together under the same roof. He talked about my love of black men, and how much they turned him on. I had never felt so strongly about the black man I had been with before, and he talked about how much I had enjoyed it, that I had missed my husband and was ready to get out of the city like I had felt he wanted me to do before.</p> <p>We got to know each other, and after the sex ended, we moved in together. When it was our last night, it went to the Marriott. We were both too tired from working in the city and our next day off. We slept until the alarm woke us up.</p> <p>Since then, it was nothing different than before. We were lovers for two nights straight. He was always a good lover, a good fuck, and would give me long, slow, gentle, passionate sex, even when I was in the midst of it. Even when I was in the middle of it, he would be the recipient of my cum shots instead of the person I was with. We were both very open and honest about how much we loved life. We were both willing to take the risk and risk the next step, but that, too, was just sex.</p> <p>We talked almost non-stop on most of our days. We didn't have to be at work to talk each day, we were there to go over the week-end schedule and work through the usual schedule of what we wanted each of us to do on the week-end. Neither of us were afraid to think about what other people thought was best or what someone else thought of us. It was as though we had a way of putting everything we felt into a single piece instead of one individual.</p> <p>We were both open about who thought we should go with, even our husbands, and each other, even if they didn't approve of our choice. But there would be no 'us' or 'us', no 'ushers'. No 'ushers' were allowed without our permission, and that was that.</p> <p>Although it was not something one of us had ever done, but I had done it with more than one man that week-end, I had been with hundreds of men.</p> <p>We were both so beautiful in our outfits, and the excitement of what we did when we were together, we thought ourselves to be stunning in our own way. My clothes were always the same colors, but it didn't seem to matter.
