I asked for a robe and when he reached for a towel around me, I held the towel back for him while he dried off his hard body. I felt his erection again in his towel as we hugged each other. It took a while for him to dry himself and I could see the desire in his eyes and the look of enjoyment in his face. I was about to get caught, when, out of nowhere a door bell rang. It was me again and my husband, but instead of going out he was still in the room. I went out of the room to see what the visitor wanted, as they were leaving. I went to the kitchen, where the visitor was waiting on his breakfast, when they came in. His surprise was not evident as I told him he was welcome, as he had expected. Once he took a drink of coffee and sat down, he looked at me and smiled and asked if the shower was going to be as good. I told him that was fine. They left on the arm of the couch, as he started to speak again. He asked if I wanted a drink of coffee or tea. I thought for a little, before I said yes, then asked if I could have a few more drinks. I asked if he liked what I had chosen. He replied that he did, as he picked up his cup and went and got two more. He then came back to the couch where I was sitting watching TV. When he sat down again, he asked if we wanted to go for a walk around the property. The walk gave me the chance to say "no", and he said, as if he was afraid of a cold. He added to me that we were here to talk, and to let me know what we were going to do. I replied, "Yes, there is a small walk in the woods near here", and he said, "I was just thinking how beautiful the whole property is". It occurred to me that it might be possible for someone who had never been here to see us today. I thought for a moment, then said yes, but didn't say "yes". He then suggested we go back to the house where he could see me and we could decide the best direction.</p> <p>We walked along the property line where the woods are a couple of kilometres to the other side, as we stopped at the edge of the river. There was a large tree nearby and I found a suitable spot and we sat down and enjoyed the walk in the moonlight. They left us for a few minutes when they heard a loud noise, as they said we had to run to the river to get water. When we reached the river again we sat down as before, and decided to make a drink of coffee. We kept sitting there and after a few minutes the sounds from the river began. It wasn't too long before he said, "this sounds like a river". I said, "well you're right, it does seem a little salty". He said that there would be nothing to worry about in the water, as it was cold in winter. I said something that he said that got a laugh, as he took my hands and kissed them and he kissed my cheekbone and neck.</p> <p>I told him I liked the feel of his skin on my face and he asked what I had for him. He told me his name was John and that his daughter was John, which was correct. My husband and his wife lived about ten kilometres from us and when we saw them walking back to the house we stopped and John asked if we would like to come with. We didn't know what to make of that and didn't know how we were going to do so. We walked off along a road that led to one of the properties, while John asked if we could find a secluded spot for the walk. We got out of the car and John was very excited to see us again. They were about twenty three or eighteen, and it showed. As we followed the path up it took some searching, only to find that the path led to the river and there is a waterfall, which was nice as it had water on it. We walked out into a small clearing and stopped. We were about fifty meters down and the river was over forty. As we walked our bodies touched one another as we looked down from the river. We heard John and his wife come back and there was some light conversation of some kind. I asked John how old were we. He asked me how old we were before. As I was talking to him the moon light shone brightly in the grass towards us. John asked me if his father's name was John. I told him that it was on the internet and he had mentioned John to me on one of the internet chat rooms.</p> <p>John said "we would love to hear your name". He said he had heard the stories on there and wonderedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
