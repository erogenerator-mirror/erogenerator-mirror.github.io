As he closed the door he looked at the three men and they all grinned.</p> <p>"I want to introduce you," she said. "This is my husband and our daughter, Heather."</p> <p>The men laughed again and said, "I'm sorry, but you just don't seem quite right for a daughter," said Jason as he moved in to kiss her hand and then to her mouth.</p> <p>As his wife hugged and kissed his daughter the two guys looked over at his son and saw a similar smile on his face.</p> <p>"I'm so glad you showed up, Jason," said Mark as he kissed Heather lightly and turned her to face him. "I've been wanting that kiss ever since Heather saw you in the store."</p> <p>"That's why I came home," he told her as he held out his hand to her and she took it. "I've been looking forward to this morning and I hope you don't mind."</p> <p>"Oh, that's right. We like the same things, and your boyfriend loves to talk about women," she said and leaned down and kissed him lightly in his mouth. "Besides, it's not that big a deal, am I right?"</p> <p>"So... I have a surprise for you, my friend," Jason said as he handed her a drink. "I hope you don't mind if Heather joins us."</p> <p>As he reached and kissed her again the two men stood to walk out of the office with the girls and Mark grabbed my wife's hand and headed toward the front of the room.</p> <p>"Jason, I'm sorry but that woman will have to come."</p> <p>"She's a lot more beautiful than I thought," said Jason with a grin. The other men looked at each other, but all nodded their agreement.</p> <p>As the men passed through the doorway Heather saw her daughter and saw Jason waving Mark toward the men with a smile.</p> <p>"I've been waiting for this day ever since Jason brought us here today."</p> <p>"I'm glad it was me, as I always knew you were a great guy," said Heather with a laugh.</p> <p>"So have you done this before?" hissed a grinning Mark.</p> <p>"Only three friends actually," she said and added, "and none of them were the ones who taught me how to dance. So there are maybe a couple other women in my circle."</p> <p>Heather then leaned to him and said, "I told you before, you're a lucky guy. I'm really glad we met today."</p> <p>"Why don't you sit down and have that drink, I have something else in mind," he said as he handed Heather a glass and motioned for her to sit down. "Come on."</p> <p>She grinned at him and smiled as she took her empty glass and sat down. All the men then walked into the door of the room and Heather heard Jason say, "And that was just the appetizer."</p> <p>Heather laughed and said, "Hah!" as she looked up.</p> <p>"I guess that's going to need time to figure everything out," said Heather with a giggle.</p> <p>As she sat down she looked over at Heather and saw her smiling. So Heather smiled too and said, "He's right, of course."</p> <p>Heather smiled and then took a sip of her drink before she said, "I think the appetizer is definitely going to be something that will be a little appetizing."</p> <p>"Is it?" asked Jason with a grin.</p> <p>"Yes it is and this is going to be one of the best appetizers I've ever had."</p> <p>He laughed as he pulled out his chair, sat down and then turned to Heather.</p> <p>"I think Heather was expecting that, didn't you."</p> <p>Heather grinned and said, "You're right."</p> <p>Then as they took a sip of their drinks Heather said, "You have a real knack for that."</p> <p>"Well maybe she was expecting something like that."</p> <p>As he sat down, Jason told the men to go and have a drink and then went back to his office. Heather was still smiling as she took the glass back. "What about you, Jason? Anything else planned?"</p> <p>As he raised his glass, Heather said, "After what you just said to me last night, I'm hoping you two can have dinner with my wife tonight and it's going to be a great evening."</p> <p>Jason smiled as he walked toward her and said, "Well, since she might have some idea how to make a real meal, I doubt we can do it without you."</p> <p>Heather looked up at himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
