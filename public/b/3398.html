She said, blushing slightly.</p> <p>"No, really, you look kind of...well, you know."</p> <p>"Good."</p> <p>"I am curious."</p> <p>"Hmm? "She replied and leaned back on the couch. "I mean, you look like you're having a lot of fun, and I like you. You seemed like you were into girls and I'm sure we've just about fucked it up. But you aren't a girl who does more than she does and isn't a girl you just need to experience for yourself."</p> <p>"You've gone too far."</p> <p>"Yeah. I'm sorry but I was just giving you what you wanted."</p> <p>"So...you and me maybe get into something?"</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>"So what kind of things do you mean?"</p> <p>"I mean, I know that you're not a girl, but I didn't know how much I meant to you."</p> <p>"Yeah, okay, that's true."</p> <p>"Yeah and I want to know what I'm missing. Does sex bother you or anything? You never said you were gay." She teased.</p> <p>"Only when it comes to love and stuff. No one that I love doesn't get enough sex. It's just the men don't really notice you. And besides you have always been a total jerk and I'm just so horny and hot right now."</p> <p>"Yeah I guess," She laughed.</p> <p>"You sure you're okay with how I'm going about it?"</p> <p>She stood up and pulled her shirt up quickly and then dropped it on the floor and kicked her shoes off. She leaned back against the couch with her feet curled behind her. Her skirt moved up to where it was in an upwards bend. She had pulled her shirt away from her head, exposing the black lace bra she was holding up. Her nipples were a dark purple colour.</p> <p>"Well, you can look, but not touch. And I won't touch you in anyway."</p> <p>"Really? "She said, feeling her nipples respond to him.</p> <p>"I mean really. So we can only do it once. Right after you get a girl, you can only touch her. Right?" He pulled his shirt over his head as he said this and his shirt fell to the floor. It was the first time she had ever seen him naked and she couldn't imagine being with him. He just sat down on the couch and pulled her down with him.</p> <p>"Okay. You go first."</p> <p>Giggling she climbed over his lap and then lowered herself down on to him. She let herself just rest on his thigh as she positioned herself so her thighs were a little more vertical than most, but as he felt the warmth from her pussy start to spread across his leg he knew it was going to be okay. Her hips rocked slowly back and forth as she felt his arousal. It had been weeks since anyone had made her cum. She'd been able to control it though with her hands, but now she was moving freely along his leg. His erection pressed uncomfortably into her stomach. She looked up at him with those deep brown eyes as she began to gyrate her hips. "Hmm. You like how pretty I look." She reached up and took the straps of her bra out of the way and slid it off of her shoulder. Then she leaned down and kissed his lips. His hands slid down under her as she continued to grind against him, her breasts barely touching his legs. It just felt so good, but he was going to make her cum soon, so he didn't want to over stimulate her.</p> <p>"I bet you want to make out with me, don't you?" He asked.</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>"Really?" His hands were pulling at her nipples, her nipples are very sensitive. He squeezed them, causing her to let out a slight moan. "Maybe," he said, "but I better let you have first." He kissed her again and pulled her down and pushed her hips back onto him. He let his hands slide off of her chest and he pulled her bra aside. Her breasts were big, but the nipples seemed to reach up in a weird way and were really long and point. He ran his hands through her hair on her back and lightly stroked her cheeks with his fingers.</p> <p>"Ohmigod. I've missed this so much." He said, and she reached forward and placed her hands on his shoulders. Then their lips once again locked and the sparks ignited. Her stomach began to tremble and her fingers were starting to move across his chest. When she lowered herself towards his waist he couldn't stop her. He wanted to do more than justâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
