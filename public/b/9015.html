It was obvious that I didn't want a woman to come in dressed like that but I couldn't say a thing about how I felt about her...</p> <p>She walked to the closed bathroom door, the one that had been standing open before as I hadn't been able to see in any real way and slowly, as not to scare me, stepped in. Her naked body, which felt as if it had been painted pink by the shower water, was not a very pretty sight, with the slightly large C cup breasts her bra had made seem to be straining to free the weight of her ample chest.</p> <p>"Honey you've left that door open! I should have locked it all the way!" I said softly and then quickly continued, "And if you'd locked the bathroom door, I could have locked it so we wouldn't get in trouble... I mean, with all that wet hair in a bunch, right? Well, I'd probably be more comfortable if... well, you know what I mean!"</p> <p>"Don't be so sweet," she said softly, "I think I should've locked the door now and we could probably be finished, you know, in peace..."</p> <p>Her remark was only half-joking as she stepped up into the shower, her nakedness inches away from mine. As she stepped in, her face was now level with mine, eyes wide open, lips slightly open. She had a lovely pink nose with a tiny pink lip. All the way down she had the most beautiful, high point, high cheek bones. The lips that had always looked so soft had parted to reveal her soft white teeth.</p> <p>I had always loved hers and would never had any part of her near me at any other time. I found her gorgeous. She stood there like we were in front of the mirror, looking into the mirror, as if I had just stepped out of the bathroom.</p> <p>With both hands reaching around her neck, I began to dry her hair. As one hand continued to dry her bare back her other hand began to caress her shoulders. Just as she had long since stopped caring about my reaction to her massages, she slowly, languidly pulled her arms back, her hands sliding down the front of her body, pausing to caress her sides and then her breasts, kneading them, caressing them...</p> <p>Now with both hands, she slowly, teasingly began to touch her thighs and lower body. I had done many a story of women's thighs over the years of my life and the few I had had had been very discrete. This was one of those times...</p> <p>"Honey, if you want me to stop, you'd better not be doing this... I really would be surprised if you went any farther," I replied gently, my breath becoming more ragged, "...and I'd probably go completely limp! In fact," I added, "I'm almost afraid to tell you how much I'd really like to be anywhere but here. Not because you're doing so... well, you're a young lady with a terrific body and a great... um... well... you're certainly a great and mature lady... and right here in this room. I could see it in your eyes. I've thought so much of you already and I could see your mind and your heart... I've just never seen it in person before and really feel like I could be of the same mind myself. It's really so wonderful! It's like I can feel it in the air now... and it's so comforting!"</p> <p>Her eyes seemed to be glistening with water when she looked down at my face. When she moved closer and took my hand in hers she said, "And I'm sure you can just feel it too," she whispered, "but I haven't had another bath yet so I hope we can go a little further before we start to get nervous!"</p> <p>And with that she stepped over to my tub, stepped right over my body and lowered herself down, until her head was about two feet above me, with her arms wrapped around my waist hugging me, as her lips gently kissed my cheek and forehead. She looked over her shoulder at me and said, "Come on you horny boy, just lie back and let me do what I always have to do to you! It feels so incredible! But I want to keep on doing this, okay?"</p> <p>I nodded and looked up for a chance to respond. As I stared into her eye's I could see a glimmer in her eyes. It was a look of pure contentment and joy. Her hands seemed to be everywhere, caressing anything she could... her face looked so beautiful and as her hands continued to move down my bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
