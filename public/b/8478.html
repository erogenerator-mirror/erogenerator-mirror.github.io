It seemed they were ready for more.</p> <p>Tina’s husband had to be the nicest man and most caring. All of her fears and fears had left her in their arms and they were all still inside her body. In their arms still naked and intertwined, they were one body.</p> <p>“I’m so scared,” she said. “Not like before when you took me home,” she added with a smile. She had never felt so safe as she was with this man in his arms.</p> <p>“I know what you mean.” He kissed the top of her head and lifted her up then moved toward the door, she heard his door close in the next room.</p> <p>“And I’m going to give my very own slut a proper good licking at least for now”, his head was near her thighs now. She shuddered as her nipples grew more erect.</p> <p>“But first, my dear husband, let’s let’s see if you’ve got the stamina to last all night.”</p> <p>He held up a large dildo. “Do I need to?”, she wondered if he really did. It was probably smaller than a cock, but it would definitely be better than his cock. She was sure he would make it better than his cock. “But, oh god…I have to get this on,” she thought.</p> <p>Without missing a beat, he moved forward and lifted her to him. He placed her on to end of a bed. He moved between her legs and she realized that he wanted her completely shaved and the best way to please him was a bald cunny. A smile crossed her face as she realized she had the same thought.</p> <p>“Oh, please,” she said, she didn’t bother to get her legs opened for him. She closed them as he knelt at her end. He wanted to kiss her all over. She was getting as wet as she could possibly get and he was sure she loved this more than her pussy.</p> <p>“Please let me suck you,” she managed. He bent down and covered her lips with his mouth. He licked gently at her clit and then sucked it into his mouth. He sucked on it gently until he felt her hands in his hair, pressing his mouth to her clit.</p> <p>“Ummmmm….hmmmmm…”, she loved it when he fucked her mouth while she sucked his cock. And she knew she couldn’t get away that easily. She felt a hand go to her clit and it felt like he had a vibrator inside her pussy.</p> <p>“Please do me,” she said.</p> <p>“Please my love,” he whispered. “I would like to eat you too.” There was some uncertainty but he moved one hand to her clit and sucked on it as he moved the other hand to her pussy to feel how wet she was.</p> <p>“Oh god,” she groaned as he pressed one finger inside her.</p> <p>“But just a little,” she panted. It felt so good to be on the receiving end of a mouth on her body.</p> <p>“My sweet wife,” he said as he moved it from her lips to hers. “But I love you more.”</p> <p>“So will I,” she whispered as their mouths continued to kiss. Tongues touched on each others lips and they were kissing passionately. He moved back then and lay down on his back and pulled her on top of him, still on top he moved his fingers to her clit. With one finger he pushed it up inside her. She moaned as his fingers moved her around.</p> <p>She moved over to where he held his cock then she straddled him and sat down on him. She felt his cock press deeper inside her, she moved a little, she took hold of the chain that connected them and pulled it, it pulled her clit on his shaft then it pulled it from her pussy, she felt it touch her labia and she moved her hand to play.</p> <p>“God, you feel so good,” she moaned as his fingers worked her and he moved his hips to meet hers, moving the chain in little circles. She moaned in time with her husband’s movements, it felt so good for her to be having this affect on him.
