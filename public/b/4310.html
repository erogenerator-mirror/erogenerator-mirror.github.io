In my case though the first couple of times we'd gone to bed would be very special. To have this first time together was simply like a new experience. It was like being back with my parents. We were sharing a special moment together, and I didn't want it to end. I wanted to go on like that for as long as I could but I didn't want to lose myself in it.</p> <p>We were both so excited that neither of us moved. That just turned us on more. And neither of us said anything, we just hugged each other and made love to each other in front of those same folks. It was a long awaited event but that wasn't quite what I was expecting. We were in my room, our parents' bedroom, just like we were. We stripped, then sat there, cuddling each other.</p> <p>"Do you want to look at these?" I whispered.</p> <p>"God, do I ever," she replied sleepily, "But do we know what we're missing?" she giggled.</p> <p>"I don't know about missing," I said, "but my cock is still hard and I'm already so worked up that I can almost feel every detail from head to toe."</p> <p>I leaned forward and our lips met, then our hands were exploring, hands roaming and finding each other. I couldn't put my finger on her clit that was rock hard and I couldn't think of anything else while our kiss broke.</p> <p>"Well," she said, "I feel as if I'm going to be able to control the sensations, but I'd say that I think we both want to try."</p> <p>She reached between us and undid my top two buttons, slipping it off over my head. She slid it off of me and slid her hands inside of me. I didn't care for my chest, no, all I knew was how excited I was from getting her naked and me feeling what she had felt. I wasn't sure I wanted to do anything else. My cock was straining for release.</p> <p>"It feels like we've been doing this before," she said, "You look even more hard and full, isn't it?" then added, "You still haven't got an erection? You need to turn round a bit."</p> <p>As if she hadn't spoken I turned round as we'd both said a few times but never as me. She held my ass cheeks apart, lifting my cock up to her face. She looked at my cock and said, "I think we're going to have some fun when we get rid of that, come on then."</p> <p>We were there for several minutes. She took me into her mouth, her tongue swirling around every part of me, then slipped me out several times to lick the drop of pre cum that had run in down my shaft until it covered the head of my cock. She started pumping me with one hand and running her other hand through her hair down to her neck as she pumped me.</p> <p>"Do you want to get on?" she asked me, "I want to get some more comfortable in this position." she added.</p> <p>I smiled back and stepped towards her. "I'll see you later," I said, "but right now I really think we ought to be doing something."</p> <p>I knelt on the bed and had her lie down, then stood upright and lifted my legs to my chest. She reached back and opened my shorts, then reached in a drawer and pulled out my cock. She wrapped her hand around it and lifted me towards her. I felt the silky hardness, the fullness of it as she held me down.</p> <p>She moved closer again, and our kiss was more urgent, I knew if I took that step a minute maybe we would both explode. That was the whole idea, even if she thought she'd cum then we couldn't, even if I climaxed. My cock slid into her easily and she reached up to stroke my face as our kiss broke.</p> <p>Then we were moving, one of us on top while the other was held down by her own need. We stopped and looked at each other. Then we looked at each other again and each of us started moving and stroking. My cock slid in and out and we both were very turned on and I knew that she was. Slowly I picked up my pace, feeling the tension in my balls as the semen raced out. I pumped as hard as I could, feeling the warmth as I shot into her. That had always done the trick and it didn't seem to last very long but I didn't mind it. When we both reached our orgasms we held each other close, kissed for a few minutesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
