His eyes were a little too much to handle right now. His face showed that he had seen me staring long enough. He was tall, about 5'8" and around 200lbs. His hair was sandy blonde, maybe a touch longer than John's. He had a beautiful smile that seemed more to be a mischievous grin than a genuine one. His eyes were dark. Very dark. They looked so good when they were full of fire as if he was burning bright pink! His eyes were like liquid pools of burning coals. His lips were so ruby red they seemed to burn the bedding in a frenzy for my poor eyes. His eyes had an unreadable expression about them that I had not seen before. The face was rugged and his skin was tanned beyond description. I found him to be the most beautiful man I had ever seen. I watched him for a moment when I first came in. He seemed nervous. I was so enrapt by his looks of the life he lived! He was tall also, at least 6'5", with dark red hair that was about shoulder length and just a little below the middle of his beautiful nose. His eyes were big and so brown they looked like he had been sunning himself. He had an athletic build and my thoughts continued as I remembered how firm and toned his body would be. I wondered if he would take care of himself! His brown eyes were mesmerizing! They sparkled as if he were bright blue. I realized then that I didn't know him that well.</p> <p>He took a step and placed both hands on John's muscular frame. I saw the white of his hands as they rippled his body. I imagined how those hands were used and John would soon take care of me while I worked the muscles in his arms. I saw him smile and he closed his eyes as I imagined.</p> <p>At that moment, John spoke. "Hey, um, your hair's looking good. I would really like to see it!" And he walked over and picked up his suit. I watched as he pulled down the sleeves to reveal a dark and beautiful shoulder blade and the black of his shirt. He looked down, admiring the cut and the way it showed off his strong and well-defined arms.</p> <p>I felt I could see John's expression as he looked at me. He then slowly raised his shirt up above his head, revealing his neck and chest. I couldn't help but look at his soft skin under the shirt. He looked as if he was about to take off that shirt anytime now. His body was as muscular as John, maybe stronger also. He slowly pulled the undershirt up over his shoulders, up to just above his shoulder blades. His arms were thick, but not as muscular as John's. I could see the veins running through his arms and shoulders. I looked at the muscles of his chest. I wondered what those muscles must have been as he slowly pulled off his shirt. I thought I would never work out a man as strong as John again. I hoped to be able to do that again soon. I watched him again as he pulled his shirt up and off his shoulders. He looked so powerful, I thought it would really be hard not to let my hands do whatever they did!</p> <p>John pulled off his shirt once he was done. I saw him pull down his shorts and my heart began to pound even harder at the thought of having someone as large as him under me again. He slowly pulled down his boxers and his cock stood out rock hard. The thought of him looking at my body now made me quiver. It was so sexy seeing him so turned on. I wanted to feel him inside me! My pussy was wet at the thought of it! I wanted him to take me again. I watched as he lowered his boxers and I saw the sight of his throbbing cock standing straight out from his groin, pointing upwards, begging to be inside me!</p> <p>I could not take the time to even glance at him as he dropped his boxers to the ground but I felt myself getting wetter. I saw his cock as he approached me and I felt my body shudder with the thought of seeing it for the first time. I was excited as well. I knew I was going to like what he saw! I felt him rub his fingers along the soft skin of my right cheek and slowly slide them down the side of my hand. When he felt my cheek, I closed my eyes and tilted my head back to rest against his hand. He took my hand again and pulled me up to my feet and again kissed me. As he slid my dress off my body, I leaned against John's strong stomach. As he removed the dress, my bra and panties were exposed. As he slid my panties off my body, he ran the tip of his tongue along the underside of my right breast. When his tongue hit it, I letâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
