Besides, it wasn't going to happen now, was it?</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"It's a little late for that," Chris said.</p> <p></p> <p>"Yeah, I kinda wish he was there," I said, blushing a little.</p> <p></p> <p>"Does he know?!" he said. "I mean, he doesn't know about you and I, and I have no idea if he knows about you and I, but if he did, he wouldn't be here so early, too."</p> <p></p> <p>"Yeah, I know, I just wish he was there with me," I smiled.</p> <p></p> <p>"Well, he probably won't come out," Chris said. "I don't know about him, though, but the least I could do is make him happy."</p> <p></p> <p>"You two would, huh?" I smiled. There was a little hesitance, but I wasn't offended, but Chris was a bigger dealer than my ex-husband.</p> <p></p> <p>We finished our meals a little bit faster than our time consuming meal, and by this time we had cleared away the dishes and were back on the floor. I had cleaned up some of the dishes and had them done, and then we sat and chatted with the group at the table. After a few moments I saw Chris look at me. What was he thinking? How would I react if they realized Chris was gay?</p> <p></p> <p>"You look pretty good," I said. His eyes dropped and he smiled.</p> <p></p> <p>"Thanks," he smiled.</p> <p></p> <p>"Well, let's see if it looks good."</p> <p></p> <p>The door opened, and there stood Chris who stopped right in front of me, and said, "I'm gay, too, so can you believe that?"</p> <p></p> <p>"Hey, it's okay. You don't have to be embarrassed if you don't like it. It won't bite you," I said, but I didn't press him. No. Not at all. I just smiled at him, and held out my hand to him.</p> <p></p> <p>"Oh, sorry," he said, pulling me back into an embrace. "I didn't mean to offend anyone."</p> <p></p> <p>"I'm just not used to guys just being around me," I admitted.</p> <p></p> <p>"So, that's okay, huh? Really?" he asked.</p> <p></p> <p>"Yeah, really," I said. He had a point there.</p> <p></p> <p>"So, anything else?" he asked, looking at me.</p> <p></p> <p>"Well, you mentioned I was gay the other night," I said. "What do you think? What's this about? Are you homophobic? Are you gay?" I said, turning toward him.</p> <p></p> <p>"I'm not," he whispered, looking down at himself. "No, not homophobic at all. I am, but not as straight as you or as straight as I was last night."</p> <p></p> <p>"So, I take it that wasn't a big surprise," I said and smiled. Chris' eyes dropped quickly.</p> <p></p> <p>"You wouldn't have had the guts to come out to me?" he said softly. I couldn't believe it. There's no way a straight man could have done this, but the thought did excite me.</p> <p></p> <p>"Probably not," I agreed, and Chris began to unbutton the front of his shirt.</p> <p></p> <p>"You're right," he admitted, and began to unbutton my shirt. I could feel his eyes on my flesh as he worked, and then, one of the buttons was undone.</p> <p></p> <p>"Hang on," I said and pulled him close to me. Chris was a big man. I could have taken the top three buttons off, but I wanted to tease him a little. And so I left the shirt unbuttoned.</p> <p></p> <p>"It's okay," I said and reached to undo another button, and he raised an eyebrow. I looked down at him, and felt a thrill run through me. How could such a man reject me?</p> <p></p> <p>"You are beautiful," he said, and I felt a twinge of pride in his words.</p> <p></p> <p>"Thank you," I said. I took a second to admire the smooth planes on his chest. His hair was wavy from the showering. It was an unusual and pleasing way to look at Chris. I couldn't believe how good his body was.</p> <p></p> <p>"Well, I'm glad you like clothes," I said. "Why don't we take a shower and put on a little show?"</p> <p></p> <p>"Sure," Chris said and I looked up to see him, waiting. We finished our dinner, and after the dishes had been cleared away we began our walk hand in handâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
