That was only the start. It was your show as well. But what do we do now?"</p> <p>The next day, I met Susan in a coffee shop. Susan and I were just about to have our coffee, when we heard a noise. We stopped and looked at something. A large black man walked up to the door. He put out his hand and held it toward us. Susan and I took it.</p> <p>"Mr Owens, you must be Bill Owens."</p> <p>"Yes. And what can I do for you today, Susan." He extended his hand to Susan. "Good to meet you."</p> <p>"Likewise," Susan replied. "But I suppose I should ask you to leave," she said firmly.</p> <p>"I don't see what wrong with that. I guess you want to make up for being late."</p> <p>"For what? For being late with me?"</p> <p>"Well, Mr Owens," Susan continued, "I think it's best if I say that you won't. I'll take that as a compliment."</p> <p>"That would be a very ungentlemanly of me. I'd suggest you to apologize."</p> <p>Susan went on. "Mr Owens..."</p> <p>"Bill Owens," the business man interrupted, cutting her off mid-sentence. "I'd like nothing more than to apologize, as well as to offer my apologies and to make a confession. Shall I have some coffee?"</p> <p>"Yes please."</p> <p>Before he left, he asked, "Susan, would you give me a second chance?"</p> <p>"Sure," she replied. She held out her hand. We shook. "It's about time. What happens now? Will she be able to keep in touch?"</p> <p>Mr Owens returned with coffee and sat down across from me. He held out his hand to Susan and took a step forward. "Thank you. That was very nice of you. Now you'd better leave. This was a very nice offer. And a very nice meeting and that's all you had to do to get me to stop. If you would like..."</p> <p>Susan put her coffee cup to his lips. She looked me up and down, smiling and blushing. "Wouldn't it be more...more...that you should have some other job or something?"</p> <p>"Actually," Bill Owens said "I should go."</p> <p>"That would be wonderful," she said and smiled at him. "Thanks for being the gentleman. And you've got a wonderful ass too."</p> <p>Mr Owens returned and stood in front of us. "I believe my name has no more to do with your name. But I hope you're not going to be going back to your boss, Bill."</p> <p>It was Bill Owens that was asking permission to apologize. "Yes, I suppose. If you feel that I can't...give your apology in some other manner, I'll understand."</p> <p>"That will be good, but for the meantime, I won't have coffee."</p> <p>"I won't want coffee," Susan added. "And thank you." I smiled at her. So it wasn't a big deal. She had me wrapped around her little finger. And I had the strength to back off the next best thing.</p> <p>Susan went back to the business man and said, "I'll leave Mr Owens here."</p> <p>When Bill Owens returned, he sat down across from me. He took out his pen and sat down again. "Susan, I think it would be best if you went back to your job."</p> <p>"What is it? Do tell," Susan interjected.</p> <p>"Well, if I find your boss in the next room...well, not in our house any more...any more. And if you find a job, either there or in my office and you come back here as often as you can, I might try it out. That is if you like."</p> <p>"I would like to do it, if that will give me an excuse to come over to your house."</p> <p>Bill Owens put his pen down. "Well, what did you expect?"</p> <p>Susan looked at the man, "What is it that you really like?"</p> <p>Bill Owens smiled but still said nothing. "Well, you do seem very nice. In fact, from you," he said, nodding toward the door "I'm not so sure it won't be a bad proposition."</p> <p>I knew it was a chance but I wouldn't have thought that my wife wanted it. "Please excuse me to go," she said as she got up. For just an instant, one of her feet went out the door, but sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
