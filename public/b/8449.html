I'm not going to take any liberties while your boyfriend was fucking you."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, you don't understand, you said yourself he was sweet, and it didn't feel like you were being taken advantage of. He just used you. And he was a great lover."</p> <p>"He wasn't a great lover – I wasn't. He hurt me and you can do whatever you want to me – if you don't like it. I want our time together to be everything you want and want to be. I'll try to let you know if I can," I whisper as we talk to each other.</p> <p>"Are you afraid you'll do what I want to do?" you ask.</p> <p>"Of course not! I won't!" I say. What am I doing?</p> <p>"Will what?" you want to know.</p> <p>"Will you let me suck your pussy?"</p> <p>"Yeah, you'll enjoy it. And if you don't, we won't, it's up to you," I reply.</p> <p>"I'll try anything you try – any way you want. I promise," you say, as I hold out my hand and you kiss it. I take you inside my apartment, and as you are putting your head in my lap you whisper, "I like the way your ass tastes."</p> <p>As we walk up to my apartment, you pull a small overnight bag away from your lap and say, "I'll see what I can do. Have fun!"</p> <p>We kiss as I hold your ass and you walk through my bedroom and as I close the door the light falls on your bedroom. After a moment you stand still and kiss me, and I open the bag of toys. You smile, "I want to do this."</p> <p>"Of course I do – all I ever say is OK", I reply, as my hand caresses your body with a feather light touch. Your hand slips down to play with my cock – it's already rock hard, and it twitches under your touch.</p> <p>And it isn't just my cock – your hand slides to work your way up my leg, and then, as your fingertips slide along my balls and up the length of my cock I can feel your breath on them. Your hand cups my ass and your fingers pull me closer to you, and you draw me in – my mouth opens to accept your tongue as it presses into my mouth.</p> <p>I run my hands up your soft legs, and then up the insides of your thighs. I can feel your body quiver as I run one hand gently under the waistband of your panties and the other under the bottom of your t-shirt. Your hands run through my hair as you pull me closer.</p> <p>With a moan you pull your lips from mine and kiss me deeply. As our mouths continue to explore, I undo the button of your shorts and slowly remove them and your panties. Your body jiggles as I slide one hand between your legs and run one finger along the length of your wet lips. "You want me don't you, slut?" I ask in a low voice. "You know how your juices are flowing," you say as you run your hand through my hair. I can feel a tremor of pleasure rippling through your body.</p> <p>I smile to myself as my fingers run along your wet slit. "So wet," you breath into my ear. "You need me."</p> <p>And then I kneel between your thighs and my tongue finds your clit, and with a moan of satisfaction, you part your legs and allow me to slide your panties to the side. Your knees spread and my tongue slides straight up into your wetness.</p> <p>My hand strokes up your legs, over your belly and I run two rough fingertips along your belly and you shudder as our mouths continue to explore each other's mouths. Your legs hold me close as my tongue explores every inch of you. Your fingers caress my head and you draw my lips to yours. You pull me up to you for another kiss and your lips touch mine once again.</p> <p>You run your hands down my neck and into my hair, and as I caress your breasts and nipples your body trembles as you begin to move your hips back and forth against my hand and I feel the wetness of your juices on my fingers. As you rock on my hand I draw my fingers back to you and then slowly slide them down to your ass and back up again.</p> <p>My mouth finds yours and I fill my tongue with yours, as your body continues to writhe in an erotic dance. I lift my mouth from yours and kiss my way up your legs, and you can feel the heat from my body through me as I—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
