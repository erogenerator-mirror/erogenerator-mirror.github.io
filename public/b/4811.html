I'm not a lesbian. I know I like you, so don't hold my panties in your face."</p> <p>He laughed again before replying, "well, let's see. I'll go take a shower, then we make a bet. You can be the one that puts my cock in your mouth. So, you better hurry up. You promised you'd be a good girl for Santa. You're supposed to suck all day or else."</p> <p>With that, he rushed off my bed. I turned to go shower, but my phone started to buzz again. I saw that it wasn't from me. I walked over to it before heading to the bathroom. My hands were trembling as I reached it. My heart raced as I closed the phone. It was my mother. I heard the shower stop. I started to walk toward the bathroom when I heard a male voice on the line.</p> <p>"I can't believe that I got her phone from you. What were you whispering to her?"</p> <p>At that point in time, I knew what to do. I stepped into the tub and sat down, allowing the water to caress my body. I closed my eyes and felt the sensations. It felt nice, but my body needed to be touched. I started to rub my breast, but I looked at it. I had to know what it felt like so I let my body do all the thinking. While I rubbed my breasts, I felt my body reacting to the sensations of what I was doing.</p> <p>When I looked down, I could see what I had been feeling. My panties were wet. I lifted them up and felt the air touch my wet panties. A wave of relief surged through my body. I opened my eyes to see why Mom would say something. "Who was that on the phone?" I thought, "I don't know." My body felt good at that moment.</p> <p>With my body still on the water, I ran the hot soap across my body. It felt good to be done with the same feeling. I felt more pleasure from each movement. I felt completely self conscious and not caring of what my body thought. I was letting my body know its own body as I so often did when I was in the tub. I rubbed my hands, feeling the tingles as my hands moved across my sensitive skin. I closed my eyes. Now I could see in my reflection's eyes. I felt beautiful, but I was in fact embarrassed for doing so, which I knew I would regret later.</p> <p>I opened my eyes, so that now I could see myself in the mirror. The reflection of a naked eighteen year old, my breasts were bouncing under my hands as I moved them again. I heard a sound from the other side of the bathroom wall. This time, I opened my eyes. I didn't see my mother's face in the mirror. I took a couple of deep breaths, and opened my eyes wide. I saw a young girl looking at me. My face was so red my hair, which was hanging just an inch above my eyes, was pulled back behind my ear. Her eyes were bright. They were wide open, staring at me. They were a dark brown and looked so innocent looking. I watched as she ran her hands from my shoulder down to my breasts. I had to close my eyes. My legs were spread and my feet were placed on either side of the lower surface of the tub where my lower thighs were. I let my fingers run down over my legs to my pussy.</p> <p>My finger slid down to my lips. I could feel my body trembling with each touch. I closed my eyes and moved my finger back and forth. I could feel my wetness flowing over my finger as it traveled deeper. My body quivered when I slowly made contact with my moist pussy. I could feel the warmth of my finger on my lips.</p> <p>I could feel the water run down my back as I started to slide my finger back and forth. I closed my eyes again and closed my eyes again. I couldn't do this. I knew what I must do.</p> <p>I closed my eyes again and felt my body trembling again as I felt my own finger on the lower surface of my pussy. I was so wet as I moved my finger back and forth. My body was trembling from the sensations. I needed to be touched a lot. I slowly started to slide a finger back and forth. I slid the finger out of me, and let it fall at the bottom of the tub. I felt another warm liquid being poured over the area around my pussy. I stopped for a second and closed my eyes again. I could see the other hand on each of her breasts, while the other was touching her nipples. One finger ran all over her lower back while the other slowly stroked across her hips, down the back of her thighâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
