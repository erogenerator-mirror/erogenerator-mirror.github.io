I asked.</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>"It would seem I have been stupid and I have gone back to the first place. I guess I did go back."</p> <p>He laughed, "And I had you, remember?"</p> <p>Then he hesitated and added, "Yes, I know; we all did. But I'll save it for the next time." And with that he left.</p> <p>I sat there stunned from such an admission. What had I done? How had I managed to make him stay? And why did I want to stay?</p> <p>****</p> <p>The following day I arrived back at my apartment and I found an empty couch. So then I went to the living room where I noticed that the door was closed and I could hear the music still on. Not quite what I had expected but then I remembered it being quiet out on the porch. I slipped into the other side of my living room and went to the door. As I looked around, I realized that in the last ten minutes or so I had been sitting in the living room again. I turned to look at my door, and was stunned by what I saw. It was open. I looked for a moment at the lamp in the other room, then went back to the living room.</p> <p>As I came closer to the door, I realized that I was wearing a different pair of slacks and my arms still ached. I looked around more carefully but I was nowhere to see. Then I went over to the door and looked for the light switch. As I turned it on, I saw the room and, for the first time, I realized what kind of light was coming on in my room. I turned back to my bedroom and was stunned by the sight of my bedroom door being closed for several minutes. I didn't know what to do, so I decided to go to the kitchen to fix breakfast.</p> <p>I looked down at myself and saw that I could still see the dim glow of my light shining on the windows. Then I walked back to my bedroom again and looked around again. I heard the music again, and then I went back to the living room. In the living room there were a few light switches. As I stood in my doorway I again looked up at the door. I could see that it had a light switch which went on every ten to fifteen seconds or so. I turned it on to low and realized that I was in my bedroom as near to the light as I could get without being seen.</p> <p>I came to find myself in my living room again but this time the door was closed again. I looked at the door once more and again went back to the living room, this time I went this time, but this time the light switch went off again and I left the room.</p> <p>I don't know what possessed me to make this decision but I went back to my bedroom and looked in the mirror again and saw that I had also changed from being my normal clothes into different clothing. I was now standing as tall as before, but my body and hair seemed smaller. I looked at my face in the mirror and saw that I had gotten to me. I turned around and saw that I was smiling at myself. I turned back around and said, "That was fun," as if that was the way my life would be.</p> <p>****</p> <p>I went back to the living room and sat down. The first time I went into the living room and looked in the refrigerator. And I found that the second time I went into my kitchen and made myself some breakfast. Of course, I didn't feel at all happy that I could have done anything else but simply sat and ate. And I was thankful that my roommate's sister, Sarah, had returned to their house. She was probably going to try to work things out but I didn't really feel like putting my life on hold. And anyway, it would be a long day, so I took my time.</p> <p>I had started to think about going to class and perhaps work some stuff to try and sort out what happened at my old apartment. But just then I saw it in my mind and it was only curiosity to be sure. And I didn't know what the hell to ask him about it. Maybe I could even ask him if I could stay there for a few days?</p> <p>It was too late now. In my room I turned on the light switch and looked around. There were still lots of things on the desk. Then I saw that I could still see the lamp on in my own room. What had I gotten myself into? I looked at the clock again. Ten minutes had passed when I remembered the situation. What must I have looked like? In a way I felt so stupid. But at the same time, I felt so at ease. There was a slight quiver to my breathâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
