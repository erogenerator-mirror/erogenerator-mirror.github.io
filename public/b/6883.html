He leaned forward and began to suck on my pussy. As he did, I leaned forward on my hands, and I leaned her head toward me, to get my lips to meet mine. As we kissed hard and deep, I could actually feel heat from his tongue touching mine, and my pussy clenched as I moaned deeply into his mouth. "Mmmmmmmm," I moaned again. "You taste good," I moaned. "Mmmmmmmmm...mmm I'm so horny."</p> <p>With a smile, he lowered his face, to my pussy, and he began to suck on me again. My heart began to hammer in my breasts as he pleasured me, and my body began to shiver as if I were having an orgasm.</p> <p>He stopped, and I looked around. He was standing in the doorway to the shower, his cock standing nearly straight and hard. He stood there for a few moments or more, watching us. I was on the brink of climaxing, his fingers still inside me, occasionally pulling out as he leaned against the shower door. I was breathing hard, my nipples were hard, and my breathing became ragged. He looked into my eyes, as if he was challenging me to come on his cock.</p> <p>"You ready for that, Baby?" he asked me. "I want you to fuck me..."</p> <p>With that, he turned and walked toward the bathroom. I heard the water start, as I was about to turn off the water and go back to bed, when the bathroom door flew open. I was stunned for a moment, then knew that he would have a towel wrapped around him, to hide his erection. The shower door quickly flew open, and it was him.</p> <p>"Oooooh, Baby," he cooed. "How are you doing back there?"</p> <p>"I am," I said, shaking my head. "It was fun, wasn't it?'"</p> <p>"It was wonderful, Babe. It was incredible," he said. He had put on a robe, as he turned to come in with a towel around his waist.</p> <p>"Baby?" he asked. "Are you ready? Are you?"</p> <p>"Are you ready to go on your honeymoon?" I asked. "I thought we were going to go on our honeymoon."</p> <p>He leaned away as I watched as he looked over at me, as he slowly walked to me. He leaned in and began to kiss me again.</p> <p>"You sure you're ready for this?" he asked me. I nodded as he kissed my cheek.</p> <p>"I am," I said a little breathlessly.</p> <p>"I know," he said. He gently laid me down on the couch and we sat together for a few minutes, just talking. He leaned over and gently started kissing me on the lips again. We kissed slowly, long, slow touches. As we were getting heated up, he leaned down and took one of my nipples between his long fingers, lightly rolling it as he kissed my lips.</p> <p>"Ohhhh, Baby," I moaned, as I felt his hands exploring my body. I spread my legs wider as he started to trace my pussy lips with his finger. He rubbed along them slowly, as his fingertips moved closer to my clit, and then back to where they were. As I moaned, my head thrashed from side to side as he slowly, methodically, and then finally, took his finger, and rubbed it back and forth against my clit.</p> <p>I could feel him slide two fingers inside me now, rubbing me in the same exact way. I had never felt anything quite like it.</p> <p>We made love slowly and gently, enjoying each other, as if there was not a part of me that we didn't want to stop.</p> <p>He began to kiss my neck, his hands caressing my breasts as our lips and tongues danced on the verge of climax. I felt myself building to orgasm as he kept rubbing his fingers harder and faster inside me, and moving them up and up, and around, and around. I moaned loudly around his lips, as the sensations I was experiencing were almost unbearable. He continued, kissing and pinching, as my body went out of control, and my mouth opened in a silent scream.</p> <p>"Baby," I moaned, as he suddenly stopped. "Oh, God," I gasped.</p> <p>"What's wrong?" he asked tenderly as his fingers pulled and twisted a nipple as hard as he could. "Are you all right?"</p> <p>"Oh..." I could barely speak. "I...I don't know."</p> <p>He leaned down, so that we were pressed together, and continued to stroke me.
