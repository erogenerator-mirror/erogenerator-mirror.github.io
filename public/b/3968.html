I love him dearly. He has a wonderful sense of humor, he loves to work hard, and is always with me. I've never told anyone that I loved him that way before. It just sort of came back to us. The things that I heard from him say to me about my father, it was always true and I loved him. I also loved what he did to me too, but the times that I talked to him about having sexual relations with his daughter. Those were my first thoughts of how many years of my life would have been ruined if I had listened to his words before my own mind?</p> <p>My mind wanders to everything we had just talked about and wondered if I would ever have the courage to tell anybody of what I was feeling like having with my father. Of course I would never think anything that she could say to tell my father that I loved him. He really is a great man, and I love him a lot, but it was nothing compared to now with him. I'm not sure if we would ever "make it" to any future, but it was something I felt like we wanted to do, not just to make it but to make it permanent. But if that's the case, then when is the date that we should go? I honestly can't tell.</p> <p>I get up off my knees and lean over towards my father, I open his robe just enough so that I can reach around to his stomach. I run my hand down his chest, over his stomach and around to his groin, which is now showing signs of life in spite of my attempts to calm him down. I then move to his head and run my lips over his ear and finally down over his mouth. He tastes delicious on my tongue, that thought alone is enough to make me want to do something else, but I also like it when it happens. Before that moment I just went through the motions. I kiss him lightly everywhere but on the forehead and nose, then gently brush my lips against his. His breathing is still short and I notice his body's reaction to both kisses and the contact of my lips against his. I feel him shiver and turn slightly to lean back against the headboard.</p> <p>He closes his eyes and sighs deeply. I run my finger down his chest and down my father's stomach and slide it under his robe. His body shudders at the touch of my other hand on the skin of his skin in a way that I've never felt done before. I stroke his chest gently, teasing and circling the edges of his nipples with my fingernails, while still stroking his cock slowly and gently. At the same time my mouth moves down and runs my tongue over his balls, gently licking across the bottom of them as I move lower, sucking down on them one after another before moving my mouth back up to meet his.</p> <p>I take my mouth away from his cock to breathe in and just look at him as I take him in fully and take him into my mouth. I can't believe that a man I barely know was fucking his wife while my friend was watching and I'm getting off on this! I move my head back towards his cock and take the swollen head of it into my mouth and begin to move up and down his shaft. The feeling of his shaft and head is like nothing I had ever felt or even noticed before. Once I have taken both of his cock deep into my mouth I move back to admire him in his nakedness. You may not notice that I have been rubbing my pussy while watching the man and his wife fuck, but I definitely noticed how he had become erect which he could clearly see right in my eyes.</p> <p>He is a gorgeous young male and he is mine. The thing that makes his cock so good is that he does his wife in the same way as I would, by making love with her as he does me. I know that if he would have been me he has been able to do that, but I can only imagine how great it is for him because even though we are a happily married couple, he is willing to do anything for me.</p> <p>The fact that I'm kneeling beside him and he is watching me sucking on his cock at the same time, while his wife is doing me in bed has me really excited. In the past few weeks, I have never had a conversation quite like this with him. It's like I'm on a first name basis with that first name basis even though it is actually his wife. Now I'm on his wavelength, I'm making him feel all that I could for some sort of purpose. I know that he's not going to give me the easy way out of this but maybe that's my only question really.</p> <p>After a second of consideration I decide that it's important forâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
