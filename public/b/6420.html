He struggled against the ropes; his fingers dug in his sides as he fought for control himself. He could not help the small, almost pathetic smile that crept onto his face—it was an expression of pure, unconditional love.</p> <p>"How does he feel now, my pet?"</p> <p>Kieron blinked his eyes at the answer, but saw no answer. He stared at the ceiling for a long moment, and he could hear the sound of his own breath as he tried to regain his breath. The only answer he could muster was a soft whimper.</p> <p>"I don't want you to fight. Not for tonight. Not when your life comes first, not when you're not sure what you want."</p> <p>In a way, it was more than that. The thought of being free wasn't the answer. But this was it. This was what he was really looking forward to; just as it was what he needed.</p> <p>He didn't know all the answers. But he knew better than to dwell on them. The idea, as far as he was concerned, was too much to handle. With a desperate need to satisfy, he pulled his lips from his chin and ran his hands down to his waist. His eyes were closed and he shook his head slightly but was helplessly held captive again.</p> <p>He closed his fist around his shaft but he knew it would not go down easily. It never had. He could feel his balls swelling, and his cock stiffening as he stroked it.</p> <p>"Come for me, my pet."</p> <p>He did not feel he had the words to answer. It sounded as though he were in deep thought. He knew he would not get what he needed if he struggled to free himself. But now he knew that he couldn't.</p> <p>There was a small part of it being true—the truth, yes, but no more. This was all too real, too real, and he was frightened; his eyes began to water.</p> <p>"What do you want?"</p> <p>But nothing came out. Instead, he felt his chest flush, and saw his hands slide up the backs of his thighs. His hips tried to thrust with only the tips of his fingers as the pressure from his hand built in a slow, tortuous spiral.</p> <p>"Please, I need you."</p> <p>Now there was nothing more he could tell that he wanted. His body was weak, in a small sort of way, but in a way that was as clear as the words that he had used once—or was there?</p> <p>"Please," he whispered, desperately trying to feel the words instead.</p> <p>"May I?"</p> <p>He saw stars as his chest rose again, and his throat closed in on the answer that was only a whisper. His own hand came up to cradle the back of his neck as he bent toward him, and he pressed him against the mattress once more.</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>The voice was more in the room, and in his heart than he remembered from before—no...it was much softer this time. It was almost a whisper. He could see it in his face, but he did not feel it. It was still.</p> <p>He began to struggle again. His fingers dug in his skin, and he tried to twist as their connection began to fail. But his weight was not to be denied.</p> <p>"Take hold."</p> <p>He felt the air leave him and he felt a little panic, as if he had done something very wrong—anything. He had wanted it, but it had been more, more of the same as before.</p> <p>His fingers tightened on the cords at the base of his throat, and he felt himself rise up on his toes. He shook his head violently.</p> <p>"No!" His voice was like iron against the wind, and he was sure the storm would come. "No!" he repeated, again, almost as hard to hear—or to hold.</p> <p>Barely able to maintain his balance, his eyes snapped shut at the thought of being taken. His wrists were still bound and he fought desperately to not thrust out, but they were not his. He forced himself to feel the need to hold on as he tried to free himself.</p> <p>"Say what you want to say."</p> <p>"Yes," he whispered, his own voice barely audible against the silence of the night. He felt weak and he could feel the strength of his body through the bonds around his wrists as he let out a deep sob.</p> <p>"Say that you will be mine."</p> <p>The tears came, sobs, more a cry than a whisper. The sobbing began to fade, and once more he was in darkness.</p> <p>His hand found the back of his neck, and he pulled him down; he found himself a little more then once, but it—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
