This is something that was completely foreign to her: she's never been the center of attention. She's the most reserved and loving partner you'd ever meet. The more passionate, the more exciting; the more vulnerable she gets, the more she is that she was once the centre of attention.</p> <p></p> <p>Her tits were spectacular.</p> <p>But as I've said, she's not my girlfriend...</p> <p>She was once the centre of attention.</p> <p>She was always the center of attention.</p> <p>My dick was hard.</p> <p>Her tits, her legs... she was always the centre... her pussy had a tight grip.</p> <p>Her hair.</p> <p>Her hands.</p> <p>Her mouth and her eyes...</p> <p>Her arse.</p> <p>Her thighs, her calves... she could've been a model...</p> <p>My God, those things seemed to have always hung around her.</p> <p>I tried to do everything to her with my mouth.</p> <p>I fucked her arse with my tongue.</p> <p>I fucked her pussy with my cock as my hands worked her body.</p> <p>I kissed her mouth to suck her tongue.</p> <p>I sucked her cum-stained lips.</p> <p>I licked her arse as she got fucked as the centre of attention.</p> <p>I was so excited, so fucking horny... "Fuck me, fuck me," she sometimes said. She had never said anything like that before. I could almost see her mind struggling with each word.</p> <p>She came so hard... I came so hard in her pussy...</p> <p>I had gone too far.</p> <p>I had gone too far with her...</p> <p>"Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me," she wanted me.</p> <p>The more I played around with her, the more I wanted her.</p> <p>She made me feel like a complete bastard and the more she seemed to want it... I found it oddly arousing.</p> <p>I was always the master.</p> <p>I was usually right about her.</p> <p>She would come to me and make herself feel submissive; I could hear it in her.</p> <p>I wanted her... she wanted me.</p> <p>I had my dick to play with... if only to feel that she was ready to go.</p> <p>So, she wanted me...?</p> <p>She wanted me...</p> <p>"Fuck me... fuck me... " I would say, but if she said it that way... it didn't matter. I would take over.</p> <p>She always wanted me to fuck her.</p> <p>I would make her go and make her feel like I was the dominant, but she would only say "yes", "yes fuck me, fuck me" if I was there.</p> <p>I always needed her to say that she desired me.</p> <p>"Fuck me," I often asked her... she would never say anything.</p> <p>"Fucking love me..." she told the camera.</p> <p>I would take her where she wanted to be...</p> <p>"Suck my cock... " I would say, but always leave the room.</p> <p>We would usually go to a strip club. I would leave her there and go off to the back - she would usually stay.</p> <p>We spent almost no time together... I never made a move on her... I never took her on.</p> <p>I was the dominant... I would always say "fuck, yeah..." whenever she was close enough and so she would always say "Oh yes, fuck" as she would start to do.</p> <p>This went on for an endless amount of time. I couldn't have given anything up...</p> <p>On one fateful occasion (our wedding) I was at home at the reception. It was a very special day for us. We had gone to the wedding to thank the minister for all the great things that had happened up to now. I was sitting with her dressed in our finest maid uniform - a black skirt and a form-fitting top. The wedding dress that she had asked for had been left for me to choose for myself.</p> <p>We were a couple of people who had been waiting for her this entire week, and she was a very special girl.</p> <p>She had just entered the room, looking beautiful, and smiling. Her long, curly hair and long blue-gray eyebrows were slightly reddened as she smiled at me. The front of her white gown was a little baggy; she could never have worn it for the day, yet she looked stunning. I could feel her eyes taking in every inch of her body. Her beautiful smile just lit up the room.</p> <p>"Did you sleep well, darling?... it was so nice to have you there again... it was such an amazing day. Everything was on a plate for us to take care of"</p> <p>"It was wonderfulâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
