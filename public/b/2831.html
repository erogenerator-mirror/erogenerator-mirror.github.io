You see. We can't just play with each other any more. Or do you want a bit of fun?" he whispered. Her eyebrows furrowed as she hesitated.</p> <p>"I... I don't know," she mumbled, looking away. He held out his hand, as she pulled her hand back in. His grip tight. Her eyes went straight to his cock. He saw the concern she had as if she could see it for the first time. And what it looked like now. A thin red ribbon, hanging down from his manhood.</p> <p>"No, I guess not at all," she said, her eyes going back to his cock. Now it was actually looking like a beautiful penis. In a couple of weeks and he'd be a real man. He had one too.</p> <p>His hand moved again, gently wrapping around her wrists. "We can't," he whispered. His hand tightened around her arms. Her knees shook a bit. She looked up, at him as another thought occurred to her. "But..." she shook herself a bit. "I can't," she said, looking away again. She reached up and touched his forearm. She could see him watching her. His face was a bit embarrassed as she did so. This was what he'd had trouble doing with her in the past. Well, it was still a little crazy, but it was probably about time he let her go and it didn't hurt to have a guy's hand on her.</p> <p>Lifting her chin, she looked him in the eyes. "I like boys too, Jack. We can't have that again."</p> <p>"We can't. We can't."</p> <p>"Can't what?" she frowned. "You and me, Jack. Jack and I. We've been together for a while now. We can make up and keep things simple. Can't we?"</p> <p>"Of course," he said, putting his hands on the bed where her head lay, looking away.</p> <p>"Good," she sighed. A little bit of a sad smile flickered on her lips as she turned to look at him. "So are you sure you don't want to be with a straight guy?" She shook her head no.</p> <p>"No, it's just different. I don't know why I did what I did last night."</p> <p>"Just be yourself, Jack," she smiled, looking away. "You're a pretty man, a decent guy. You're a man, right?"</p> <p>She looked up at him again, feeling slightly embarrassed. It was just that his cock was standing almost straight up. She felt a hand on her lower back, sliding down her spine. "I guess so," she said tentatively. For the first time, he touched her ass cheek. His fingers slowly wrapped around her cheek.</p> <p>"We can't be in a relationship, Jack."</p> <p>"No," he smiled. "But this is our last semester of college. It's not like I just have to stick to my classes."</p> <p>His hand moved, running softly down her back. It moved up and down on her naked butt. The contact caused another shiver to go through her and she gasped slightly. His hand was gentle, yet assertive as he cupped the naked cheeks of her ass to his belly. Her legs almost collapsed to the mattress as he kneaded the cheeks.</p> <p>He moved his hand, up her back as he leaned down to kiss her, her lips opening slightly as he did so. Her arms fell to her sides as she enjoyed his touch. She let him kiss her as he kneaded her skin. He turned her face up toward him and kissed away her embarrassment. Then he sat up, pulling her down with him.</p> <p>"I shouldn't have done that, Jack. It's been pretty crazy," she said, looking away from him.</p> <p>"Please don't lie to me again," he whispered. "If this was between us, we would be doing this for real." His lips rested on hers, his tongue gently invading her mouth as one hand cupped her ass, feeling her softness. "Come on," he whispered, his hand sliding slowly over her back. "Come to a motel room. Take a shower. You're a man, aren't you?" He could feel the wetness of her pussy against his hand and his cock was already straining to get out. It was hard to believe she was a straight girl.</p> <p>"Mmhm," she murmured, her eyes looking away from him.</p> <p>"Now tell me why we're in a relationship," he teased once more, sliding down her body, kissing and licking his way up to her breasts. His hand caressed her, moving from her breasts to her tummy. His middle finger slipped over her moundâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
