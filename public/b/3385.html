You feel so tight. Fuck me Michael," she yelled.</p> <p>I took my cock out.</p> <p>"Get up. Bring your ass down here," I commanded.</p> <p>She climbed astride my cock. She reached around, placed the head to her pussy and I pushed it in. My cock made a slosh. Her wetness mixed with her wetness. I pushed it back in. I fucked her harder and faster, pounding her and she squirmed on my cock with renewed vigor. I pushed her up again, grabbed my cock and pressed it into her asshole, pushing all the way. "Oh shit! Oh shit!" she cried as her orgasm peaked quickly. My cock deep in her ass brought me over the top. I held on to her hips and thrust into her until I came. I kept pumping until my cock softened and I released.</p> <p>"Oh shit, I've never known a guy's cum so much," she said.</p> <p>She rested her ass on my cock. She turned her head as I caressed her shoulders, cheek and neck. I moved to hold her as I leaned slightly on my arms with my hands. I felt her breasts and her stomach. She looked in my eyes, lovingly.</p> <p>"Thanks for the breakfast. It's been a while."</p> <p>"Any time. We need to shower up and get all this shit off to the gym and maybe do some work."</p> <p>"So do you boys know what you want?" she giggled.</p> <p>"Not really," both said at the same time at the same time. This was the first time I had felt a woman's body and it was as though it was a sexual encounter and I wasn't interested in any weirdo I would try to screw up.</p> <p>We took care of the last of the shopping, put on our sweat pants, sneakers and flip flops and we went out a few minutes later.</p> <p>"It looks like we might be back inside for a visit," she said.</p> <p>"No way. We can't afford to keep this place up all day. We haven't seen our favorite waitress back in ages."</p> <p>"I'll call your father and ask him to pick us up," I said. She agreed.</p> <p>"Ok. So if I go, you'll tell Michael to fuck me and tell him to fuck my husband," she said.</p> <p>"I'll think of Michael first."</p> <p>When we got back to the house, she told me to get me a wash and change and would be at the spa ready to serve Michael that afternoon. I put on my jacket and we went down to the patio to enjoy a bottle of Merlot to go with coffee while we waited for Michael to arrive.</p> <p>When he did arrive, his jaw dropped open when he saw her. She was standing in her street clothes, the same clothes I wore last night and today even had a new skirt she just put on. He looked at her as he handed her the coffee and sipped it. He didn't even have to look at her tits. He simply stared at her tits. As instructed she was standing in front of him, the skirt was long enough to barely cover her ass and as she stood like that your eyes kept going up. He was in a trance as he sat at the bar and sipped his coffee. He watched her body as she walked towards him. Finally, she was ready to get on her knees and service him.</p> <p>In the next twenty minutes Michael was all hers. She got him hard again and then, just as quickly, she left. She did a few things in the bathroom, washed herself and came back to us with a washcloth. She held it out to us and we cleaned up and she held out her arms for a hug. I got up to leave and she hugged me back. This was no longer a sexual hug. It was no longer a sexual relationship. We hugged each other tightly and she pulled the skirt up. Then she turned and kissed me quickly.</p> <p>"We are going to do this again. It's been so long."</p> <p>"You know it won't be long."</p> <p>We kissed for a few minutes. She backed off and stood there looking at me. I was still in my boxers and she didn't need to take them off. I reached out and took her face in my hands and she turned her head and kissed my cheek.</p> <p>"Good bye. We're friends and we'll get back together next week."</p> <p>We got up and she started to walk out, but I stopped her. "Not a chance. We're friends."</p> <p>With that she turned and walked out.</p> <p>She was out the door and back in the house, aloneâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
