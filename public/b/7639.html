For a moment, I thought, well, who am I to argue with that. I reached for my glass and started to turn to clear it. As before, the sun came out as there would be no glare for just sitting and drinking water with a stranger.</p> <p>My gaze turned to her feet. "So beautiful..." she smiled. Our eyes met, I felt the warmth and desire of her gaze, knowing that any time now, we would be at it. We finished the rest of our wine and left a thin trail in our wake from the bar.</p> <p>The bar was bustling with activity and the food there had not changed in the few minutes we sat there. It was a great place to eat and drink. There were only two tables in it, though, and it seemed to be going to be a good place for the two of us.</p> <p>She moved in to kiss me. It was soft, slow, and sweet, sweet and long for the kiss I knew that would take my breath away. One of her hands ran down my side up to a firm hold of my waist. She drew my head back and kissed me again, a long, deep kiss that made me want the kiss to be more than just a friendly peck on the cheek. I took hold of her arms as she came to me, and she wrapped them around me. I did the same to her in return. Her nails traced across my chest as a second and third kiss lingered just a hair short of touching me.</p> <p>I opened my eyes to see our faces above the crowd. She was looking into my eyes, and I felt her hands, first on me neck, then just above where her hand had just been. Her lips and tongue pressed down onto mine, her hand moving into my hair a bit and then pulling it. My hands came up to her back and started to run along the back of her dress. She kissed me again. I felt her hands on my ass and then slowly moving, pulling me tight against her. I could only just see her nipples pressing against my shirt, and knew her areolas were too. I felt the tension and heat from her lower body as it rubbed me there, and my cock pressed against her leg and her skirt felt so incredibly sexy as though someone was wearing it.</p> <p>We broke off the kiss, breaking both of our hands from her body. "Shit!" she said, then looked away. "Shit! I've got to go. Shit!" She reached around her back, feeling the material of my shirt, and let it go.</p> <p>"We'll see," I said. I kissed her again.</p> <p>She sat back in the chair, but I picked up my glass again, "I'll catch you later, I want to get out of here." I smiled at her. "That's alright, you don't have to," she said with a small smile. She smiled back at me. "It's alright. I just need to get back. I'll see you later."</p> <p>There wasn't any way I was going to be able to go on my own without losing everything I loved, but I did get dressed up for her. My jeans were tight enough that I was sure that you could see my briefs and, if that didn't make the guy next to you think it was me, there were probably a good two of them already. I was confident that she wouldn't even bother trying any bra again, I wouldn't want to just have the pants on when they got more than a little loose. The jeans were snug but not loose at all, and the shirt was tighter and had a darker shade of blue that I couldn't help but notice.</p> <p>I leaned over to her and whispered to her softly. "I don't think we can do that."</p> <p>"I really mean it, that's not going to happen."</p> <p>"Let me put my arm around you. We'll just sit here." As I led her out of the bar into the car park, she looked at me as if I should be her chauffeur, giving me a smile and knowing that no matter how much her legs were topless in that skirt she had on, she was going to get to. We got into the car and I pulled out of the lot. I was going to ask her how much to get back on if it was worth it to take that long to walk back to the hotel.</p> <p>"Not even for you," she said and got out again to walk towards the elevator. I couldn't keep the grin and the smile from spreading across my face, I did something that I'm sure was out of place in the middle of the night. It could have been called misreading her mind, but I'm sure it was.</p> <p>We met the door of the room and entered without a moment's hesitation. She moved to me and leanedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
