She tried to rise against him with one hand to try and cover her bottom, but he pushed against it, forcing her back down to her own lap. "No, of course you wouldn't. And if there is a price for being your slave my little slave," he whispered in her ear, "then it is worth it."</p> <p>He pulled back his hand and pulled a condom from his jacket and popped the rubber onto the tip of his erection. He pushed the head towards her lips, rubbing the head between them. "Open your legs some, love," he whispered.</p> <p>She couldn't believe her own behavior since she left the party, her inability to speak out loud, and to obey. With each touch to her clit she shuddered in her seat, and when he touched her, he was surprised that she was wet. "You are," he said softly, "I am your master, and you have the body of a girl, not a boy, that I want in my bed tonight." He felt as if his dick had a mind of it's own, and that made it twitch at the thought of her.</p> <p>This wasn't going to be a simple evening. He had taken her so gently into his personal bed that she was sure there was never going to be anything more. "Tell me then, what do you want, love? Do you want to be my slave?"</p> <p>She felt the words tumble out of her hot, dry lips and she tried to reply, but no sound was heard. "Do you know what I want? Do you know what I want?"</p> <p>"Yes, master," she managed to say, only a few more words. "I want to be your slave."</p> <p>"I can't do that, slave. You're not ready to be my slave. If you had a choice, I can't take that. If you are not sure what you want yet, I'm sure there is always someone to talk to. If you just want to be with me, you can be my sex slave anytime you like. But not tonight, and I will be the one doing the talking." He looked at her, seeing the tears still wetting her cheeks. "Open your legs and let me in your pussy," he said, "I want to see if you are ready."</p> <p>She opened her legs a little, her hands reaching to push them back towards her.</p> <p>"Open your legs more," he said, and she complied, her hands going to the hem of her dress to pull it up just as she had done to him. He moved his erection up to her and rubbed the smooth skin of his cock along her dripping wet mound. She could feel him harden even more against her lips, and she felt almost as if it were him, not some dildo.</p> <p>"You'll be my sex slave tonight, I know baby, all night, in fact." He moved his member right between her pussy lips now, and she felt it press hard against her clit. "I'm going to make your pussy mine," he muttered, and then he slid his thick head into her. "There isn't anything you could do but ask for it," he said softly, "because I don't believe a word you just said."</p> <p>She wanted to cry. It had been so long since she had a choice, but he had pulled out the vibrator after using it on her. Then she felt herself fill with his dick.</p> <p>He pulled back out again, and she felt him penetrate her some more. Then his hips pushed in again, just as if he were going to fuck her. "Please, master, oh please, let me make you mine."</p> <p>"There isn't a word you can tell me, because I can't hear you at all," he said, and she felt more and more full of him as he thrust deep into her. "You are my slave now, aren't you? Your cunt and your ass can only take me in. And if you want to be my slave, then the one thing you will ever know and desire is me."</p> <p>He pressed harderâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
