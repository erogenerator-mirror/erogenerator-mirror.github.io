Then he looked at the clock. He'd been around the block a lot.</p> <p>"Maybe we could give her a while with us."</p> <p>"That's an idea. I think we can use her next break to start with, though we'll have to wait."</p> <p>Denny was out in the bedroom in about ten minutes and we got back in the kitchen with our supplies and things. I had the coffee and sat it down in front of her while she was finishing making something for herself.</p> <p>"So tell me about your day today. I didn't think it was going to be so busy."</p> <p>"I didn't go to school. There aren't any sports teams in town. I just went to the university this week. And that's when I had this idea about finding someone new to help out."</p> <p>She smiled at this and took a bite of her burger. She held it up with both hands while she looked me over.</p> <p>"And I think it's going to be nice to let my son get laid for the first time in a really long time."</p> <p>A few minutes later Denny stood up and took his clothes off. He was fully naked now and she was taking off her clothes as well. She was looking very good in the outfit she'd given me in the car. She turned her back to me and I could see her shapely cheeks swaying as she walked over to her car. She came back with a small bag and she opened it up and showed me what she'd brought with it.</p> <p>"Come on, I'm gonna put this in the car and you can join me then."</p> <p>"Sounds good."</p> <p>Denny was still leaning against the kitchen table with his feet on each side. He turned and looked back and I felt a bit of a leer coming off him. I didn't give him much chance to get a hard-on as he quickly walked over to me and hugged me.</p> <p>"This is nice. I love the smell of you."</p> <p>"I'm glad you like me." I said as I returned his hug. "Maybe we can take a shower together sometime."</p> <p>"I don't want to get in the shower too far."</p> <p>"No but we can take a shower and then do anything else that we normally do together. Right now, we both have things to do."</p> <p>I let Denny go after a little while and we both started toward the bathroom. She turned the shower off and we climbed in together. He turned to me and gave me a big hug and then they made their way up the stairs to bathroom. I walked them to the bathroom and we each got in the shower. I watched him lean back against the side of the shower as I washed his face. We washed him like that for a few minutes before we got out of the shower and dried off. I stood up and Denny dried his face.</p> <p>"Can I go first?"</p> <p>"No, I'm really busy right now. I'm only letting you do our hair."</p> <p>"So you've gone without sex in a month?"</p> <p>"We have sex now or almost every night. Don't you think so?"</p> <p>"Oh, I don't know. I guess I've been a little out of practice."</p> <p>"You should really give it a chance when you're married. They say it's not good to put any pressure on yourself. The right person, the right thing is not always the person you want. It can be that way."</p> <p>Denny's eyes were twinkling again and I was loving him as I watched him reach out with both hands and start to wash his hair. We heard the shower turn off and went to get dressed while I watched from the doorway. Denny was starting to get dressed and I walked over to let him out the door.</p> <p>"So what did you think? Did you like it? Did you enjoy it?"</p> <p>"I think you're right. It was nice and I hope you two will come back another time and enjoy it together."</p> <p>"Oh I will. Come on. Let's go to your room and have a nice shower."</p> <p>We left our towels there while Denny dried his hair. We got out of our clothes and headed through to the bedroom together. There was a moment of uncomfortable silence when we entered that bedroom. I felt his hands on my upper legs as he leaned forward to kiss my lips. When we broke apart, I looked at him and smiled.</p> <p>"Don't you wish we could make love like this every night? No commitments? No pressure from me?" I asked.</p> <p>"You have no say in it. You are my wife and if the opportunity presents itself you will have it with me.
