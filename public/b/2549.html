I mean, don't everyone think you're a sexual pervert? I mean, you're a good husband, right? Who doesn't go to a ball on their own after sex? Don't think you get to see what it's like to fuck a man, when you're a guy? Is there a man who can't wait to fuck a girl just by watching the girl's body and having sex with the guy? Is there a girl who you don't have the patience to wait to do? If you're a girl that's just looking for a man to fuck, does that make you a lesbian? Is your penis just a means to an end? Do you like being sexually frustrated?</p> <p>The only way to find out is to find out, and right when you do find out, you'll know. But what if you are right? You're not doing the man you want to be with. Well, maybe that's a good thing—maybe that's a bad thing...</p> <p>Yes, I know, you're right. But just until after he's inside you, right? It can't hurt to try out the man you feel you are about to be with, right? Just do it, and it won't be much. It's just a quick, simple, gentle try. But just for you, be ready to enjoy yourself, whether you have a girl watching you or not. Have fun with your new friend.</p> <p>There you go. That's how it works. We're done here. You look over to see that my mom's car is gone and your dad's on the road. Your mom and dad are gone too. Just two people who love each other and are just happy to have each other.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>I'm going to miss you.</p> <p>You look so happy. You look so sweet. I didn't think you'd be back.</p> <p>I won't be gone long. I think I'll just stay with you, too.</p> <p>Let's not make any more of this. We'll talk about some things later. There really isn't anything worth talking about.</p> <p>Your mom's welcome back too!</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>It was a long night, but, I hope, you slept well. At least it was after I'd finished telling my tale of my sexual awakening.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>I'm going with you.</p> <p>It was a strange night. I think you liked it as much as I did. I know we're going to do it again, again and again, some time, again and again.</p> <p>In the end, we were both happy again, although we did talk about other things, too.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>So I guess I'm telling you what you wanted to hear.</p> <p>The truth is that we have some good memories of our time together. It was good with you.</p> <p>Now, I know this may be a bit of a stretch, but it seems like we're together for ever.</p> <p>For example: a few weeks before this, I said I was going to stay at your parents' house. They're going to be busy for a few hours.</p> <p>I also mentioned that you might like to come in for some rest after your session with the guy in the movie last week, just as a reward for being good last week. I know you have to admit that you feel a bit jealous of your boyfriend, and that you felt really good about yourself.</p> <p>But I just want to say: I feel good. Yeah, I feel good about myself. I actually feel happy. I really like being with you. I'm glad that you don't hate me. And yes, I may think of you more as my lover than a friend or girlfriend. But you're right: I do. I still don't hate you. You've been good for me. You've been very good for me.</p> <p>I think you'll enjoy him as well as our sessions today. Maybe he's not as good as you think. Maybe he never will. Maybe I'll never be able to say yes to that offer.</p> <p>Of course, you can call him on his cell if you want.</p> <p>I've asked him to put it in my voicemail, though.</p> <p>It'll make a little difference!</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>I'm going to be in the guest room.</p> <p>I'm in the bedroom, naked and feeling really good. The house is quiet, but I notice, in the closet, your clothes are in the closet along with my own. If this wasn't your first time, I probably wouldn't even know what was in my closet.</p> <p>I'm also thinking about what we had talked about last week, about your relationship with your dad and with me—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
