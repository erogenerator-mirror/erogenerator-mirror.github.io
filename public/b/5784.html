There had been a few moments of silence, the tension ebbed and flowed after a while. After a while my mind was in another place as I tried to decide what to do next.</p> <p>Finally I said, "We had a bet!"</p> <p>"What is it?"</p> <p>"I bet you won." I said, my voice shaking. The butterflies in my stomach began turning into a nervous stomach.</p> <p>"Ok, that was silly," he said. "That was for being so sweet. That was just a joke."</p> <p>I smiled at him. "I am not so much a sweet person as you are, sweet as I am. That was an accident."</p> <p>He gave me a look. It was a combination of mischievous and serious. He leaned forward and looked me up and down. He then reached up with his hand and cupped my face in his hand. Then he leaned over and gently kissed me on the lips.</p> <p>It was a soft, tender gesture. It lasted a long time.</p> <p>There was no hurry. I knew we had to wait. We had to continue, we had to take it slowly but right now we had to build on that. I thought about this for a while. All the time I had been thinking about it. I really couldn't wait to be with him, right now.</p> <p>Chapter 3</p> <p>The next morning I had the most bizarre experience of my life. I was sitting in the living room getting myself ready when I heard a knock on the door.</p> <p>I was so excited and nervous that it took me a long time for the next moment. I was nervous and nervous as the door opened and a guy said "Hello?"</p> <p>"It's me. Sorry about that," I said, not knowing what to say.</p> <p>"It's fine! It was nice meeting you." He laughed. "I'm Mark." He took a step forward and extended his hand.</p> <p>I took his hand. It was warm and firm. It was like a big, white hand. The fingers were very manly and had the slightest curve, giving me a soft, gentle feel. The touch was electric, sending shivers down my spine.</p> <p>I shook his hand briefly before I let go. He was shorter than me but certainly not as thin. I was taller. He was the opposite of average height, but with what seemed to be a bit of an oddity going. Mark also had a kind of rugged beauty to him. He had a dark hair and eyes. His beard had an elegant look, which made him look very distinguished. He was a little bit shorter than me, about 5'5 or 5'11.</p> <p>"I am John" the other man said, extending his hand, "and this is Bill."</p> <p>"It's nice to meet you both," I said as I shook Mark's hand.</p> <p>Bill, who had been the one to say hello, just looked me over with a blank face and dropped his head. I felt so shy and small sitting there in person.</p> <p>Mark, on the other hand, was more of a stranger. He came from a very rough background and hadn't spoken much English. His kind of accent was always in the way. His handshake was just warm and firm. He was short compared to Mark, probably only 10. I didn't know why he came over, nor could I. He was looking at us, as if there was a chance we were going to get to talk.</p> <p>We were both looking around the living room until he said,"I'm in here."</p> <p>With that, there was a big gap of space in the room. We looked at each other, waiting for our breath to become normal again. With only inches separating us, we looked at each other for a while. What we saw was one of the most beautiful people I had ever seen in person.</p> <p>I noticed a bit of the "mature" manhood between his legs and I found it intoxicating. After that we just sat there, staring at the television while looking at the TV. Bill was sitting on one end of the couch, as we were.</p> <p>"Want to watch a little TV?" I said to him. He nodded.</p> <p>"Ok. We can watch something if you like."</p> <p>I looked at him. "You are very good at that."</p> <p>"Thanks," he said. It occurred to me that he had never mentioned the fact that he wasn't a big fan of "POWL" movies before.</p> <p>"Don't get used to it," I said to Mark. "It's not like you are the only one in the apartment."</p> <p>"I'm sorry," he said as he got to his feet.
