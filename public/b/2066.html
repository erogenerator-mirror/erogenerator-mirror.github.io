I’m too out of it,” I replied, still in the water, watching him with growing fear.</p> <p>“Come on in,” he said again as he entered the living room.</p> <p>He stepped into the room and pulled me along with him, his cock in his hand, and he pressed two fingers into my mouth.</p> <p>“Take off your top baby,” he whispered into my mouth, his hot breath washing over me, causing me to shiver and then shudder.</p> <p>“Do it,” he said, looking at my nipples as he continued to rub his fingers in my mouth.</p> <p>He began sucking my nipples again, his fingers working to pull hard and twist them between his fingers. The water continued to tickle and slosh between our bodies.</p> <p>“That’s it baby, suck on my fingers,” he whispered, as he pinched both nipples together while he continued to move his fingers in and around my mouth. He looked down at me watching his hands and mouth move around my body, teasing at my nipples, driving me wild.</p> <p>I pulled hard onto his fingers, forcing his fingers to pull apart as I sucked hard on his mouth, feeling them slide deep into my mouth and into the back of my throat.</p> <p>“Good girl,” he said as he watched my face contort in a look of pleasure, making me hot, but not ready to climax yet. He pushed and pulled my nipples in one hand, pinching and twisting the other, making me groan and arch my back, pushing against his mouth, wanting him to fuck me.</p> <p>“Come on,” he whispered as I struggled to get my tits covered again.</p> <p>After a few moments, he pulled his hand away and I felt him pull me up, bringing me toward the edge of the pool.</p> <p>“Hold on. I want to fuck you,” he whispered, his words sounding like a low growl.</p> <p>“NO!” I yelled, still trying to move, but only making contact with the ground for a moment as I felt him pull my bikini bottom up from below. He spread my legs and slowly inserted his cock between my swollen lips, pushing into me slowly, feeling the moisture and pushing in deep as I struggled to pull him in deeper.</p> <p>“Ohhhh baby,” he groaned, as his cock slid inside me. My legs began to wrap against his chest; I felt the strong muscular muscle moving deeper and deeper inside me.</p> <p>“Fuck me,” I thought to myself, feeling him press fully into me, filling me up. He began to fuck me hard, deep, and fast with long, urgent strokes. I was screaming now, with each stroke, feeling the wave of ecstasy running through my loins, over and over again. My body convulsed over and over as he began to pump fast, deep and hard into me, feeling like he was trying to cum.</p> <p>“Oh, fuck,” he groaned as he held my hips tight against the side of the pool for support. “Don’t stop. You make me come so fucking much....” as he plunged his cock hard and deep into me one last time.</p> <p>He pulled himself away from me and dropped to the floor as me and looked at him, my head bent to the surface of the water as he caught his breath.</p> <p>We both laughed as I stood there, his cum dripping all over my belly.</p> <p>“How about the game then?” he asked, putting his head back against the back of the chair, looking up at me.</p> <p>“It’s yours now,” I answered, a bit sheepishly, knowing he wouldn’t forget what I’d done. I walked past him out of the pool and into to the next room through the living room. He watched me as I walked up the stairs, my bikini still up on the floor. “Good thing I'm not in the mood to clean up or go out there like that,” I thought to myself as I approached the master bedroom. As I entered the room, the lights on the bedside table were glowing, and I could see the white sheets, as my mother used to sleep there now.</p> <p>He had already taken off his shirt, leaving only a blue cotton T-shirt, the white cotton with a black pattern. It’s a very pretty color, he said to me.</p> <p>“How about the game?” I said as he looked at—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
