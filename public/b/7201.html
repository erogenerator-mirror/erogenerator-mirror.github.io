"I want to tell you how I feel."</p> <p>As he pulled away from that sweet pussy he couldn't find a comeback and so he kissed her neck and chest, sucking her skin into his mouth and biting on her nipples as she ground her hips against him faster.</p> <p>When he was done he lowered his mouth and bit around her other nipple.</p> <p>"Amber you're making me," his voice was thick with excitement. "Didn't I come in your lap last night?"</p> <p>Amber pulled away from him with his hardness still pressed against her body and smiled as she felt his hands run up and down her back.</p> <p>"I'll take good care of your needs," she said, still on cloud nine. "This place is amazing."</p> <p>It was also very strange feeling his hardness pressing into her from behind. And then again it seemed like he had only had the head inside her a couple of times. He didn't seem so big now he was inside her! She wondered what he'd felt like.</p> <p>She felt his hands working her body while he slowly pushed deeper in her body.</p> <p>"How is that," she said as he came back out.</p> <p>"Pretty good," he said.</p> <p>Just then she felt his hands running up her body to her breasts. He slowly pinched her nipples between his index and forefingers.</p> <p>"Your hands are perfect," he whispered. "They're so soft."</p> <p>Amber's smile vanished as he began to lift his body up her body, grinding it on top of her as he kissed her deeply and roughly. She felt his erection against her thigh and her panties were rubbing herself on him. She wanted to make him cum inside her now... but she remembered the night they'd gone to bed last night, he hadn't had sex yet.</p> <p>"Amber I want it so bad," he said. "Let's go for some fun."</p> <p>Without saying a word to stop him she walked behind him, slowly pulling her top down over her breasts. He followed suit and quickly pulled his clothing off as the night changed both their minds and their sex lives even more. As it was their first time in her home in over two weeks, Amber was extremely horny and didn't want to wait much longer to get to it.</p> <p>Amber pulled down on the hood of her car, turned it off and drove away, but not before she pressed her body against him. She loved every minute of the evening, the way he held her and kissed her. She could tell he'd been turned on by what she'd just done to him, and what she was doing.</p> <p>She felt him shift against her back and she knew his hands were on her back. His fingers teased her nipples and the softness of her back, down her sides and the small of her stomach. She felt the warmth of his body against her and she looked over at the window of her car in hope that he might be tempted to just pull back out.</p> <p>He moved his head down and whispered. "I want to taste you."</p> <p>Amber was surprised by his words but didn't say anything. When he lowered his lips to her neck her heart beat faster and she felt her already wet panties getting wetter.</p> <p>And as his hands began to rub the small of her back she felt his wet lips and her spine tingling against the skin of her neck. "Amber?" he whispered.</p> <p>The softness of her skin as he slowly licked and nipped at her neck was more than she'd ever imagined. Her heart pounded faster with each lick; he was sucking on her neck while his hand worked its way down one side of her body and her thighs.</p> <p>"Please," she asked as she tilted her head back as much as she could move, her entire body begging for his touch. "Take me right now," she told him as he lifted her skirt up over her ass again and started to stroke her clit.</p> <p>"Hang on," she called out as she moved a step closer to him. "We've got to go, they'll be home just before you get to town."</p> <p>She could feel his cock pressing up against her as he stroked her.
