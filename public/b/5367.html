"Do you want me to come back to help you," he asked, his eyes still on the two women. "Just one last time," he added. "Let's try."</p> <p>"No let's not," Kari said, moving towards the door. "No one can know that I have an audience," she said with a smile. He leaned back and sighed, his tiredness still showing in his face. He turned and closed the door, his fingers digging into his palms. She was right - he had no audience.</p> <p>"Let me go," he mumbled.</p> <p>She nodded and stood, walking back into the living area. She looked back at him and saw that he had gone to the door. He stood up and walked back to the door, his eyes fixated on her. A few moments later he left.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>"Shit, sorry, I am not going home," Dixie said as she climbed into the car. "I don't even know where I am going, but it's got to be the best weather right now."</p> <p>"Shit, I didn't know that they were coming," Jorah said, leaning over the steering wheel, staring out the window as she looked at the weather. She felt as if she had lost track of the events of the last few days from her previous life. She had just told a strange man that she was coming home to her mother in a car that she had never seen before.</p> <p>Dixie smiled warmly and sat down in the seat before looking back at him. He was so focused on her that she thought she saw the flash of a small smile on his lips. "So?" she said. He nodded, his eyes still on the road as he got out of the car and got into it. She watched him leave, her stomach doing flip-flops now. She hoped the rest of the night was going to be filled with nothing more that he had. She closed her book and pulled out her notebook, reading once more.</p> <p>The drive to the airport was uneventful. She knew that there was a plane waiting to land in Philadelphia, but they had to keep up with it. She drove around the suburbs, looking at a few properties she had spotted that were in the country. He was there, and she knew that it was him, so she let the engine run and parked in the lot. She had a feeling that she may be getting a little bored with this, but she didn't care. She was bored with it, and she felt that she was going to see him again, once she got home. And now she was going to see him again.</p> <p>She walked across the street back to the house and walked inside, looking for him. She was surprised to find him sitting on the couch with all of the other furniture set up around him, and his legs were kicking out of the rest of the sofa. She pulled out a beer and joined him at the end of the couch, sitting down next to him.</p> <p>"So, how'd it go?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don't really know. I did a little of everything, but nothing really that I am really sure of what I did. I am not really sure that I want to talk about it right now. The whole time I was at home, I never saw him before because he had to talk to his family or something."</p> <p>"He sure seems to make you feel that much better in the morning," Dixie finished off her beer. "I am glad you aren't upset about me. I wasn't mad at him. I am relieved that I didn't have to take off with something that just came from his mouth."</p> <p>"What was it that came from his tongue," he asked. Dixie had no idea what words to use, but he didn't seem to be able to think of them. They would have to do something to make her feel that way. "I don't know. I think that I was doing a pretty good job of it already."</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess I am too. I was pretty tired after what, you know, I did," Dixie answered. "I didn't really have an idea how I should feel about all of this. You know, maybe I wanted to just go ahead and enjoy myself for the time being."</p> <p>"I am glad that you didn't have anything to do with it," Jorah said, her voice becoming a little harsher. "I'm glad that you found out how much you really hurt that creep before it came to that. I just hope that you had a good experience."</p> <p>"And you had better get back home to get all of that shit out of your life," Dixie said. "I don't know how muchâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
