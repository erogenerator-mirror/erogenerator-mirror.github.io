She parted her legs. "Let me be in control." Her hands came up to rub at my shoulders and chest. Her legs closed around me and we kissed. Her tongue was still busy inside my mouth but she pushed her tongue as far inside of my mouth as she could and then she stopped kissing me. We broke our kiss and I smiled at her. "I think a little more pressure." The truth of that statement made me smile.</p> <p>She kissed and rubbed hard against my cock and the insides of my thighs as she pulled me forward. When I was nearly to the edge she stopped and I heard the door to our room open. She rubbed and rubbed harder against my cock causing me to moan. When she was satisfied she backed away a bit then she turned around and pushed my legs open for me. When she felt my cock against her ass she moaned and ground against me then she reached back and put two and then three fingers inside me.</p> <p>I took the opportunity to reach down and rub her clit with my thumb and to open her ass. She moaned and started to push her ass back against me. My fingers went faster and harder into her with each of her strokes. Her moan became loud and she pushed back hard against me when she pushed my thumb even harder against her clit. I felt her tighten around me and she started to shake and she moaned very loudly as a second orgasm hit her. I let out a loud groan against her and she moaned loudly as she got close to another climax.</p> <p>"Let me cum," she whimpered.</p> <p>She pushed her ass back hard against me. I pressed my thumb harder against her. The second orgasm went on for a few seconds then I put my thumb hard against her clit to push her over again. Her moan turned to one more moan then I felt her shake and I felt her asshole relax against my cock to allow me in. I pushed hard into her and she moaned. I was on auto-attack again, pounding hard into her with all my might. I slammed hard into her and then stopped to let her recover a bit. When she finished, I pulled out of her and rolled off of her. She looked confused for a second then she reached up and grabbed me and started to pull me on top of her. I smiled down at her and leaned down to kiss her lips. She pulled me back up to her and kissed me hard. Our tongues locked in a furious kiss then she smiled and we broke the kiss.</p> <p>"Are you sure you like a condom?" She asked sexily.</p> <p>"Absolutely." I smiled. "We just need to go slow and stop."</p> <p>She reached down and grabbed the lube from the bed table. She looked at me again and I nodded. She lubed me up then she pulled her leg back against me and I started to rub her ass. I could tell that she was turned on and I got the feeling about how turned she must have been. I was feeling pretty good myself so I leaned back to lie up against her as I had done the night before. She reached around my shoulders and started to rub my cock up and down her pussy again then she was back under her control again.</p> <p>I laid back to get used to the feel of her wet pussy against him and then she began to work my shaft with her fingers again. "You have the perfect body," I said to her.</p> <p>"I am very turned on myself. I'm really horny though." She pulled my head down to kiss me. "I like to tease you too," she said as she looked around the room. I nodded my consent. "Let me put some lube on my fingers and then I will put you in. I'll be back in an hour," she said with a smile.</p> <p>"Sure," I agreed.</p> <p>She gave my cock a squeeze as I heard the back door open. Cecilia walked back into the bathroom. She started to strip out of her clothing at the door then looked over at me with a sly smile. "I will just put on the condom. Just give me a minute." She said smiling at me as she pulled the rubber over the end of my cock. She stepped into the bathroom then pulled the door closed. In her bedroom and on the bed next to her, she held her left hand up at me as I walked over and got into position. "Ready?" She asked me.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"This will hold you while you finish off the condom and then it is your turn to fuck me."</p> <p>She spread her legs and lay against me. She kissed me long and hard while she reached between us and spread her pussy lips with her hand. A second later she guided my cock inside, with the lube all overâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
