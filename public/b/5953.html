I'm glad to have enjoyed it, but as soon as I got into bed with you, I knew. I've been waiting for this moment to happen for so long." I leaned forward and kissed her deeply, running the tip of my tongue over her bottom lip, drawing a gasp from her. I leaned forward again and let my tongue explore the edge of her mouth, circling her lips and then tracing the edge of her mouth with the tip of my tongue until she responded and pulled my face toward hers. This kiss was one of the best ever. Our lips and tongues explored each other gently, caressing, then teasing the other. While I was kissing her, I was running my hands down her back, over her butt and legs, and reaching around to stroke her breasts. I pulled back from the contact of her tongue and gave her neck a soft kiss. "I want to make love, too. We can be alone for awhile. After I feel it building."</p> <p>"I don't think I could handle being naked all the time like this, but I think we'll be able to start this weekend without a lot of clothes on. I like your style of bed, and I've wanted one since the first time I was here. Why don't you take a shower before we get started?" I got out of the bed and got my towel and dried myself. She was already in the bathroom, and as soon as I came out she was out of the door and in the shower. "I'll see you tomorrow," I said as I opened the door for her and closed it.</p> <p>While she stepped into the shower, I started on my new bed, which looked a little rough but was still perfect, and got her into the shower with me. We got under the spray and lathered each other slowly and thoroughly. She leaned against me, pressing me back against the shower wall. I slid my hands up her sides to her chest, and down her hips and inner thighs. I caressed her breasts while she leaned over to hold the spray on her face, pressing her breasts against my hands and sliding them all the way down her body, stopping at her mound just to cup her mound gently around my hardness.</p> <p>When we came out of the spray, she pulled my shirt off, then pulled my trousers off and laid me onto the bed. She knelt between my legs, pulling my briefs off. I stepped out of them and she pulled off my socks. She crawled up between my legs, my hardness bobbing between her thighs. She kissed me softly and held herself there waiting. I lifted her butt up to give her more room, and she began kissing along the sides and back of my cock. When she reached the top of my legs she kissed across to my bottom, and then began kissing it all the way down, over my balls and to my shaft, where she sucked slowly and lavefully until her lips were almost touching my tip. She pulled away and looked deep into my eyes as she flicked her tongue across the tip of my cock at the top of her little lap.</p> <p>"Your cock tastes good," she said as she held my cock and ran her tongue up the entire length. "It is just what I've been waiting for." She slowly eased him into her mouth, sucking while she moved up and down on me, stroking and teasing me as she sucked slowly, looking me in the eyes, licking her lips as she came up on me. I was close, but I didn't want to come too soon. She let me fuck her mouth, and just watched, stroking my shaft with one hands while she sucked. When I thought I couldn't keep going any longer she pulled off my hardon, got up on her hands and knees and looked back at me over her shoulder. "Are you ready for your turn now, my love?" she asked me. "I want you so badly!" I looked at her gorgeous ass, my hands on her cheeks, and thought, 'How the hell am I going to get this woman to keep this from hurting me?</p> <p>When I entered her, the feeling was extraordinary. I could go much deeper and feel her cervix against me. There was no pain with me now, just a feeling of warm wetness, and tight embrace. I just pushed into her a bit farther than I had when it happened, and she started to moan and moan, and she was wetter with each thrust. I slowly took my time, and as we got into a rhythm with an almost feverish urgency, she started to meet me thrust for thrust. This was the perfect combination of stimulation and pleasure I had ever felt. I could feel every ripple of her orgasm inside me, and my body was beginning to shiver from being so close to her.</p> <p>After a time I felt her start to get more vigorous, and I pushed her face into the pillow, and her legs went into myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
