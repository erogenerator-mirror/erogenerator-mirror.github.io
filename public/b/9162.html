Your cum is so sweet!" she exclaimed. "I haven't tasted yours so soon, my God!" and she continued to lick the spunk off her fingers, which were still slowly sliding into her, and was slowly working the rest of her fingers in her gaping cunt.</p> <p>Finally she pushed her fingers out and leaned back, her eyes closed and her head leaning forward. It took her almost no time at all to get the sperm back in her mouth, her cheeks and chin flushed, her tongue out, to show it to the world. But I was on my own, unable to move a thing. I heard myself, but I wasn't sure for a second what I was being told. The memory of a man getting his cock sucked by a total stranger is so powerful. But my brain was having trouble remembering and I could feel my heart skip several beats when I heard the sound of a girl breathing rapidly with her eyes closing.</p> <p>I don't know exactly what went down, all I knew it seemed that she was going to cum, but once she did, she was going to continue to suck my dick until it would be dry. She didn't take long to do this, and eventually she would have it dry, but that just wasn't the best idea. Her cum didn't seem to be the right kind of liquid to give me a good cum shot. I had no cum for my cock since she came up my leg. I felt like I didn't want her cum on my leg any more then.</p> <p>We stayed on the floor, on another floor, for what seemed like an eternity. I had an arm around her, holding her to me with the other. When we broke the silence, we were panting heavily and it helped me think of the future. We went to an adjacent room where we found a chair and both sat down. As we sat, I tried to remember the details in my mind, what happens in the future, and how we might work them all out later. Her words, her kisses, the orgasm she always had with me while we did it made me so excited. We finally sat and were silent for a minute. The look that she gave me as she spoke made me feel as guilty and vulnerable she was in her situation, but I was also happy that she was feeling the same way about me. She smiled at me a little. I tried to think of things to say about it, but I didn't have the time or the energy to say much. We finally decided it was time for something to happen. We went back to bed and made love again, and it was a little different this time. It was more passionate, more loving as I had never been with a woman before. I felt better, and she too I felt. There really wasn't a chance I could cum in her again, I was tired from the long drive. We slept until noon. I woke early after her wake, and we enjoyed ourselves for another hour or so. We then showered together, and dressed each other and went to lunch together. We had never done so much together before.</p> <p>We ate lunch together, while we watched a new comedy show on TV, and I knew that we should have a glass of wine. We shared about the night before, but that didn't explain the kiss I was experiencing earlier. When our plates were filled, I took her hand and led her back to the bedroom, in a room that I knew intimately, and felt safe in.</p> <p>We slept until around one a.m. when she decided to go to the bath. We did the toilet and dried each other off. We sat on the bed, and she told me about it from her own dream. "You have your little girl there and you're so pretty to look at. You're mine. I'm yours."</p> <p>"You're my little girl?" I answered. "I'm your girl?"</p> <p>"Yes, I'm your mommy. I'm the one you want. You're going to make me yours."</p> <p>"I'm going to make you... I just need a little more time," I told her. "How long will that take?"</p> <p>"About a week," she said.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I said. "It will take some time. But I guess it will take it to get here."</p> <p>"I told you it couldn't take long. You just needed some time to catch up. And I have to go out of town on business."</p> <p>"I couldn't wait, but will you let me come back next week, and keep me?"</p> <p>"You're a good girl, too." I got into bed and we talked, and slept a little longer.</p> <p>Saturday morning I drove to work early to find that she had come back with her family. But I had an early meeting to meet her parents in. I saw them sitting in a coffee shopâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
