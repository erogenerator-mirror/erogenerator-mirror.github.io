It was quarter to ten. "Well that's a long day. I need to head to the bathroom real quick," she said. "Have a nice stay here, but don't expect to see us for a while."</p> <p>"What are you doing?"</p> <p>Dana went to the restroom first and looked in the mirror. She could see the blush on her cheeks as she looked around the barista, checking out the place.</p> <p>She sat behind a counter and looked at the menu for the rest of the day. She was getting really curious if she should try to make it with another person, but she could not get the bartender for the same reason.</p> <p>At 10 o'clock, she heard her husband yelling, "I'm going to kill you."</p> <p>Dana went over to the bar to yell at his name. She had already made up her mind. Her heart pounded in her ears, but she could not hear anything more except groans and moans. She started rubbing her hands all over herself to try to calm down as she was a bit annoyed with herself for not being able to help. Her husband had not gotten the message; it's not like he could come home without making sex with her, but he had to be there to make sure nothing happened.</p> <p>"Dana, it's ok," his voice sounded like he sounded angry. "I'll wait for you in the back."</p> <p>"No don't go," she turned the water on and sat on the end of a stool in front her. It was a hot summer day so she wore shorts and a halter top. It was no time when she was about to try to get to sleep without thinking about what she was going to do next.</p> <p>"Dana," her husband grabbed her hand, pulling it up to his mouth and pushing her fingers inside. "I'm in the back," he growled.</p> <p>"I'm tired," she said as she turned to the mirror.</p> <p>She could not hear anything through the mirror but felt the tears that were stinging in her eyes as she looked at herself. She had never had her husband so angry. She felt it was a small victory, but she was sure he would probably give it to her good bye. She ran her hands through her hair and looked at her face in the mirror. Not a pretty face that she had seen, but a beautiful face. Her eyes were red and her hair was short. She had been crying, but the sounds she made were muffled by her fingers. He was right; she was tired and tired and tired of going to work.</p> <p>"It's ok, baby," he rubbed her shoulder. "Just wait for me to get home and I'll be there for you."</p> <p>Dana could barely hear herself, it was like he was shouting her name. Her skin was clammy and her breath was short. It was as if she was ready to puke, but she felt no anger. She had finally figured out that she did not want to make his life hell. She looked up at him, trying to wipe away anything else that was there.</p> <p>"Let's get out of here," his voice sounded like it sounded like she was walking on a wet cement floor.</p> <p>Dana's head felt better and she stood up and pulled herself up to see more of herself. The water made her face look amazing from the end. She got out, dried off and looked back at herself in the mirror. She was amazed that her hair looked good. The towel dried it, leaving the rest of her hair completely soft. She turned the bathroom off and walked to the back of the barista. She looked towards the front of the booth. There was a guy there but he was nowhere really. She looked towards him again and he was definitely not here. She closed her eyes and pulled herself close to him.</p> <p>Her heart hammered hard against her chest, but she felt like she just wanted to see him. She wanted to look into his eyes, wanted to feel his hands on her body, wanted to touch him.</p> <p>She reached her hand down to his pants pocket, unbuttoning them and pulling out the key board of the keychain. In her hand, he had a small gold key. She took the key from him and put it in her pocket, pulling her shirt right off over there and then. Her breath was hot against her neck. She reached down and pulled her panties to the side and felt there. She touched herself down there and felt it throb and pulsed around her finger.</p> <p>She reached her finger back to her hole and pushed it in, feeling it grow under the pressure she was applying. She pulled her finger out when she felt she could not stand a bit more. She went in the bathroom only to take a leak. Her pussy was throbbingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
