I've only been with two men."</p> <p>"Then I'm glad we're as open and honest with each other."</p> <p>"You'll never love me, my man. I think that's so pathetic."</p> <p>"If you were a man, you wouldn't be saying anything like that, would you?"</p> <p>She sniffs. Then takes another swallow. "I don't love you. I swear I do."</p> <p>I think I have seen it in his eyes before, but I don't think he has.</p> <p>I reach for her hand. She pushes me away gently and then pulls away.</p> <p>"Leave me alone, Daddy. I'm sorry. I don't know how to tell you what I think you should know. I've already told you everything, and I'll let you know all about it in a few minutes."</p> <p>I turn her to face her and put my hand on her cheek. "Shhh. Just let me talk in your ear first. It might help."</p> <p>She smiles and leans in for something that I'll have no trouble remembering.</p> <p>Her lips part, and she kisses me on the mouth. It's not soft, but not quick or aggressive. It's sensual, but not threatening.</p> <p>Her lips pull back with another kiss, and she's pulling down my shirt. She's pulling down my shorts. They fall down my legs as she takes off her tank top. I'm naked, as well as she is. I'm naked.</p> <p>She gets on her hands and knees and spreads her cheeks. Her pussy looks beautiful. I sit on my knees, put my arms under her knees and lift them so I can kiss her. She opens her mouth to say something, but I have my mouth planted on the mouth of her vagina. "Daddy," she says, "it's wrong to make love to me like that."</p> <p>"Are you sure?" She looks around. "I heard you going to get up."</p> <p>"Let's go." She gets on her feet. "Let's go."</p> <p>I have her on my bed, lying on her back. I get between her legs and enter her slowly.</p> <p>I like it slow. It's easier for me to go slow.</p> <p>I'm just barely entering her pussy when she looks at me and says, "Slow, okay? Slow." When she puts her hands on my butt I kiss her cheek. I'm going as slow as I can for now, going as long as I can stay inside her. When I'm fully inside of her I start to move, and she loves that.</p> <p>I'm just sliding the full length of my cock. She looks up at me. "That's nice. Slow strokes, and a stroke to start."</p> <p>When she's moaning, I speed up.</p> <p>"Oh God, baby. Slow. Slow." It's only a stroke, but it's like being completely at home without having to worry about the other person. That's more comfortable. Her ass is still on my shoulder, but I move slowly but the feeling of her pussy on me is incredible. "That's good, honey. That's better."</p> <p>"I know. Just fuck me, slowly and sweetly. You just hit my clit, that's the big thing. Fuck me, fuck me, sweet girl. That's good. Do that to me." I continue to slow, but she's moaning and telling me to speed up.</p> <p>"Don't be afraid, honey. Oh, baby, I'm going to cum. Oh, yeah, just a few strokes. Oh, oh, oh. Yeah." Her pussy is on FIRE.</p> <p>I'm not getting far in.</p> <p>"Shit. Fuck, you're making me CUM!"</p> <p>"Good." I slow, then speed up.</p> <p>"Oh, God, Daddy, oh, oh, I'm... cumming." Her body's vibrating like crazy. It starts low, but starts getting louder.</p> <p>"Oh, yes, Daddy. Oh, yes."</p> <p>She takes my cock out of her. I don't think she knew I was getting close.</p> <p>"Oh, yes, baby. I'm cumming, baby," I say as she puts her arms around me to hold me in. She kisses me again and I'm in her in no time at all.</p> <p>We lay against each other for awhile, trying to calm ourselves. I don't know how long our first love, together, was. We lay in bed, hugging and rubbing noses, and feeling each other's bodies.</p> <p>We make out a few more times, then she gets up andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
