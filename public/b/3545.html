It's like she's a little girl who has been told all her life she must always wear a pink teddy when she's out, and then another time she must make these little noises when she's in the car, especially when she's out in traffic. No, what I want to see now is how she dresses and the little noises her nipples make when we drive by. If you must know, I think you could also say those things, especially when she's not looking. What does that say about that woman of yours, though?</p> <p>Linda, you just know as long as he is with you what happens and how he'll react when he sees you. I still know how upset she is when we first met and how she's just embarrassed. I think that's a turn on for both of you and it's true that he wants to do something special for her, but I don't. I mean, he is very young and I mean quite a big lad. I think that's the first time I've ever had a penis in my hand. If we do this with him in the car, I think he will never want you any more. But you'll have to be there, he'll want you to be."</p> <p>Linda took a deep breath and said, "What do you think, Dave? If you're going to do something else to her, it probably will be one of those little things you do. I doubt you would want to, but I know you like to watch what happens to her. If you could get them both to come on to the road as well I have no doubt that you would do that." She looked a little unsure now and with a thoughtful look on her face. "Well, in that case he doesn't really want me to go without panties, and you know that I like to drive with my underwear on. But I have to be careful around him. When we get back at the apartment maybe it would be best if I could leave my panties around that we drive all the way home. Sometimes it seems like we're too close and it can be difficult to keep the car on the road."</p> <p>Dave smiled at her and said, "Well, that seems fair. If you really want to do that, and I'm sure you do, feel free."</p> <p>"Sure, I'll be glad to," answered Linda with a smile and a knowing little smile on her face. "Well, I guess we still need to decide on which outfit to wear in the car, though. Maybe I can get that pretty dress over it so we can go home together."</p> <p>"Now, that was unexpected," said Dave. "So I think it's important to just take everything else off, and you'll be fine. I think you're too sweet to have anything on for a while now."</p> <p>Linda smiled and said, "Now that we've decided a compromise between us, there are two more things to consider."</p> <p>Dave said, "As you wish, then."</p> <p>"Just remember, one thing we haven't decided about yet is having you wear those panties to the prom. That's just another one of your duties, but I know, once we get home, I want to do this every time we're on the road. Just as long as you're wearing panties for every occasion. And you'll get them in the meantime. And I wouldn't make another mistake about telling you that I do. I think we might get lucky, at least until I'm done with the prom party."</p> <p>Dave looked puzzled, but said, "But you say you love to kiss, so that's kind of why we're leaving that alone in the car."</p> <p>Linda smiled sweetly and said, "I like to kiss, and a few girls can do that before I'm through with one of our things, but it's also kind of fun for a while. I have a pretty good idea what kind of fun it is too, but it's not too much fun if we're doing it standing. I've learned a few things from the old guys. Some of them are really good ones. If there's a good one, I like to pick one that I'll wear whenever I'm in the mood. Other girls can do that too and even some other times when I'm having a few drinks."</p> <p>Dave smiled as she paused and said, "Yeah, that sounds really fun."</p> <p>Linda kissed Dave gently on the lips again with a smile and said, "Oh stop if you must. But it's really a little late to give up the idea if it gets too awkward."</p> <p>Dave kissed her again, more gently this time, and said, "That didn'tâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
