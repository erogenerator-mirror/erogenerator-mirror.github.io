He couldn't make out her bra size beneath the cloth, because she was standing in front of him, completely naked. It was too far gone to be possible that she had gone to the bathroom.</p> <p>"Yeah, I know, I just wanna go home now, you know? I never even realized they were really supposed to be on tonight. I mean... the weather has changed... it's just..."</p> <p>"Too bad you're here, eh?" she teased.</p> <p>He stared down at the floor. The rain had started. He didn't know if he was ready to put his arm around her still naked body or not, even though the thought might cross his mind.</p> <p>"It's too early," he finally said, not looking up at her.</p> <p>"Oh, honey, just tell me what you need, you don't have to be nervous,"</p> <p>"Hurry up, hurry, I'm ready!"</p> <p>She pulled her jeans and underwear down to her ankles and threw them on top of the wet fabric.</p> <p>"Put your hand on your pussy, baby," she urged, pointing toward herself. It was like he was reading it from her. As soon as he did, he saw the glistening sheen of wetness, and she was ready.</p> <p>She ran her hands along the curve of her hips, down her smooth stomach to her wet-covered cunt.</p> <p>His eyes widened in shock.</p> <p>"Yeah, baby, just put you hand on your cock," she ordered, but in a tone of voice with emphasis. He did as he was told.</p> <p>"Oh, baby, sooo wet," she said with a smile. She leaned in for a kiss, and he pulled her close. He put his lips into her mouth, and they kissed, first lightly, then hungrily.</p> <p>He felt her kiss him again as his hands slid down her back. It was like kissing a virgin, just as intense as before. He pulled her shirt over her head, exposing the breasts he'd dreamed about for years. She felt cool, and he sucked her nipples slightly into his mouth. Her back arched and she sighed with pleasure, not quite as loud as before, but not as soft either. Her hands went around his head and he took a nipple into his mouth, and he started to suck it gently while he slid his hand down to her slick opening.</p> <p>She moaned with pleasure and surprise as he stroked her. She felt him enter her.</p> <p>"Oh God, honey, you're so big! Please, darling, fuck me!"</p> <p>"But you said we'd go to bed. We can't... I can't....," he trailed off.</p> <p>Sofia sighed and laid her head back on the pillows, closing her eyes. He didn't need to be told to stop, which he needed desperately, not that she wouldn't have done it for him if she wanted too. They started to kiss again, but she pulled away slightly, "It's okay, I want it back in me. I want your dick inside me, darling."</p> <p>He kissed her lips even as she kissed him. His hands kneaded her ass as they kissed again. He kissed along her jaw to her earlobe, then down to her neck, and back. He ran his tongue across the soft skin and she let out a soft moan. Their eyes never left one another as they kissed.</p> <p>"God, baby, you're so good at that! Don't stop, please!" she moaned.</p> <p>He stopped for a second and kissed a trail up her chest, to her neck, and down again. He kissed and nibbled her lower lip, then moved down, taking her nipple into his mouth and sucking with force. She gasped with pleasure.</p> <p>She wrapped her fingers in his hair as his mouth went lower and he took her left nipple into his mouth. His tongue flicking it gently as he bit down with his teeth. Her body tightened and he could tell she wanted more.</p> <p>He felt her legs tighten behind his head as he heard her groan. He slid his lips down her other lip and onto her chest while rubbing her belly gently. As he kissed and bit her, she let out a small moan of pleasure.</p> <p>"Fuck me, darling, I want you," she whispered hoarsely, her eyes half-closed.</p> <p>He had to laugh a little, but he didn't let up until the words were out of his mouth.</p> <p>"I've waited years to do this," sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
