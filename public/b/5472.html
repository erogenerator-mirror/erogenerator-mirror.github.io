"And I'm back here," she said as she headed for the bed. "Let me grab my phone so I can get rid of some more work."</p> <p>"Okay," I nodded as I got up and headed off to the bathroom. I found some shampoo and ran two wetscented soaps through my hair.</p> <p>"Is he gone?" Sarah asked as she looked at the clock. We had been walking for almost half an hour. "I got two half-hour drive this morning."</p> <p>"Oh, yeah," I agreed. "It's just for two weeks."</p> <p>"Does he always leave the door unlocked?" She asked.</p> <p>"Once in a while, you know that," I said as I headed back to the bedroom. "I'm going to be spending a lot of time just lying in the sun. Then when I'm ready to go out, it's back to work."</p> <p>"You're a nice guy. And you're not exactly a creep."</p> <p>"No, I'm not. It's not like that," I said. I sat next to her on the bed and stretched. "It's just been nice."</p> <p>"You're not going anywhere." She smiled at me as I slid out from underneath her. "Are you going to stay the night?"</p> <p>I didn't even want to think about sleeping in a different bed and getting dressed and leaving her to wake up in the morning. "Yes, but only if you're up for it," I said with a wink.</p> <p>She laughed while I got out of the tub, "Don't do that, you're my boyfriend," she said as she turned the water off. "I want to see if you're hard."</p> <p>"Just wait until you get back," I said, and got back under the water. I was getting a slight buzz as I sat next to Sarah. The smell of shampoo made me feel refreshed.</p> <p>"Wow," Sarah said. "I really didn't expect this, but that's exactly what I'm trying to say now," she said.</p> <p>"I wanted you to know about tonight," I said as she leaned over me and kissed me. "And while you're here, I'll be doing whatever I need, you should have the most fun by yourself."</p> <p>"I thought you'd never ask," she said as she kissed my lips and held me tight. "I'm not sure what came over me," she teased before letting me go.</p> <p>"You don't mind if I sleep here tonight?" I asked.</p> <p>"No," she said as she moved a little closer. "It's okay with me." Her fingers wrapped around my penis and she kissed me again. "I'm going to have a lot of fun with this."</p> <p>"I'll always have a place for you here." I said as I wrapped my arm around her waist. "And it's not like I'm a creep or anything like that."</p> <p>"No," she smiled as she squeezed me. "You're the best thing that's ever happened to me. And I'll never leave you if the desire is strong enough. Just be nice, okay?" she asked, looking at me funny as she put more soap on my arm.</p> <p>"Okay," I nodded, and got into bed. "So, this night could never get better," I said. "I really enjoyed this meeting you had with her, and I'd like to see you a lot more."</p> <p>"You're not going anywhere with me," she said as she sat on the side of the bed with me. Her body had lost a few pounds too. "I think you're about the most sexy thing that's ever happened to me," she commented.</p> <p>"I know," I said in reply, and she leaned up and kissed me again. "We're both just trying to be nice and make things better for me."</p> <p>"I promise," she smiled, and turned her body to press herself against my side.</p> <p>"This is nice," I told her as I felt her body pressing against me. We sat motionless for a moment. When I rolled her over on top of me, to the point where she was leaning a little forward and I was lying underneath her, she said softly, "This bed is so comfortable, I might need to wake it up before we go any higher."</p> <p>"It's fine," I assured her. "I'm just going to lie in here a little while longer."</p> <p>"I know we've got a lot to talk about," she said, and pushed herself back on her stomach.</p> <p>I looked at her bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
