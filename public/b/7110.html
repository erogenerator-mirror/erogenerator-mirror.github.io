I'm already wet and I'm really excited. I just want to go all the way. Now fuck me."</p> <p>I started off slowly, picking up speed as I went. Soon I hit that point where the sensations grew so intense I almost couldn't bear the thought. I pulled my legs up and wrapped them around her waist to try to keep pace. But just as they tightened around her, my fingers started to go numb. She was so wet it was no problem to get my fingers back into her now. I was so fucking close.</p> <p>"Come on, I guess we should stop," she gasped. "We've got all night." A few moments passed before she let me go. I turned her around and we kissed. I couldn't kiss a woman as wet and passionate as hers.</p> <p>This time, I moved my lips to her neck and started to run my tongue around her ears. She moaned and pulled her mouth away from mine. I could hear her breathing coming in gasps with her face against mine. Her breath was the most sexy smell I had ever smelled. I continued to run my long tongue over her face as her breathing finally began to return to normal.</p> <p>"You're amazing," she said. "You're so hot."</p> <p>"And you're beautiful," I said, looking at her face.</p> <p>"Oh...Thank you." Her voice was so beautiful as she responded. "That was just so hot... I never thought I'd do that."</p> <p>"Really? I'm glad you liked it."</p> <p>"I liked it... really..." my voice trailed off into a moan as she moved to kiss me again, pulling her body so close to mine.</p> <p>Our hands found each other, touching and teasing and exploring... but we didn't get near touching each other. This time I was on top. I broke the kiss and turned her around. Now my hands were on her shoulders, working their way down to her chest. By the time I got there, she was already breathing more heavily. I moved in with her and kissed her again.</p> <p>I started out kissing her neck, her ear, and her cheek, moving slowly toward her mouth until finally my tongue brushed against hers. Her breathing had picked up to near a frenzied pace. I didn't want our kiss to end so soon; it wouldn't be fair if she just kept kissing me.</p> <p>I reached up to her face and brushed my fingers across her lips. They were so soft, barely trembling. We kissed for long minutes, kissing each other so deeply, and not caring about the taste of the other.</p> <p>Finally, I sat up and told her to get on her back. She looked me in the eyes as I stood above her. She said her legs were still shaky. I smiled and gently pulled her legs apart. We kissed again, then I started to kiss down her chest. The more I touched her, the more she moaned.</p> <p>"Oh, do I have to touch you? Do I have to? I don't even know you," I teased.</p> <p>"I know what I want to do; what I want to do..."</p> <p>I leaned forward, placed my hands on either side of her head, and lowered myself down her body. I kissed her stomach and started to slowly move down to her hips. She had to have gone completely still; she just closed her eyes without a word. Her body felt so soft and warm. I kissed and moved down her legs, stopping just below her knees. I finally got her legs open and pulled a strip of fabric away.</p> <p>The smell of her excited pussy was so intoxicating. It was delicious. I looked up for a second and her eyes had closed at the same time as I kissed down her thigh.</p> <p>I started to lick her clit, running my tongue around it, feeling how silky smooth it was under my tongue. She moaned and moved against my face. I continued to lick and kiss her clit for about five minutes, enjoying the taste and feel of her.</p> <p>Finally, I moved my tongue all around her pussy, feeling the heat and wetness. I could hear her breathing deep and fast now. I felt the heat flowing down my face. Finally, I moved back up her body. She opened her eyes at the same time as she moved. I smiled and looked at her face.</p> <p>"You taste so good," I said with a smile.</p> <p>"Can we get... more?" she asked breathlessly.</p> <p>"More." I looked up at her and her eyes were half closed. I didn't want to stop what we were doing. I moved even closer and placed my body under hers once again. She grabbed my wrist and held me to her.</p> <p>"Hurt me," she whispered.</p> <p>I smiled at her and leanedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
