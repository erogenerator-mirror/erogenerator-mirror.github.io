I'll see you later." With that and his arms wrapped around her, he pulled her head down and kissed her, making her kiss him back just as passionately. "I'll be home in a few."</p> <p>~~~</p> <p>~~~</p> <p>Mari lay in bed, watching her husband.</p> <p>~~~</p> <p>"What is wrong with you?" she asked.</p> <p>"Nothing," he replied. "It's just that my Mom and Dad are gone and my Dad is going out for the weekend. It's no big deal. They were going camping over here to do the 'hike' and to be honest, I don't think this is where I wanted to go."</p> <p>"What, camping?"</p> <p>"Yes, this is a camping area. We all go camping every year over here. Sometimes we get away with it too." He said.</p> <p>"Why not?"</p> <p>"To take advantage of it. I didn't get any sleep. You know I'll catch you if you catch me."</p> <p>Mari's heart started beating wildly. She felt like she was going to faint.</p> <p>~~~</p> <p>~~~</p> <p>"Ok baby. I'm home and so is yours." Ryan said, his face brightening. Mari and Ryan sat up to say goodnight, when he pulled back and pulled her in for a hug.</p> <p>~~~</p> <p>Mari let out a sigh before she moved into him, kissing his lips lightly. "I'll be right here." she said. "Ryan, I have to go take a rain check today. The weather is so good, we can do this all day tomorrow but I promise that we can do the whole thing tomorrow." She said, giving him a quick peck on the lips. Her tears were already forming in the corners of her eyes.</p> <p>~~~</p> <p>Mari pulled out a small bag and put it on the table, then pulled up her clothes from the closet. "I hope you'll be fine. I will keep you safe."</p> <p>~~~</p> <p>Ryan let out a deep sigh. He looked over at Mari and she looked even harder. He was worried that she would be hurt by his worry but what hurt even more was that her desire to leave his house all happened at the hands of his very much, very possessive wife. His body ached, even to the point of discomfort. He was a little angry with himself at that moment, but Mari was her own woman! She hadn't even had time to take a shower, she was already soiled and it seemed as if all she had on her mind was taking a shower or getting dressed. After all, what more woman would want to than this woman?! He grabbed his phone and called for a cab. Mari smiled and followed him a while later. They made their way to the apartment and took the elevator to the first floor.</p> <p>~~~</p> <p>After hanging up the phone, Ryan knocked on Mari's door. The door opened and Mari stuck her head in before opening the door, letting him in. "I hate being late, you know that!" she replied.</p> <p>He laughed at how she would tease him. "Of course I know. I'm home by six so I don't have to come so early."</p> <p>Mari turned her back so he could see her butt. "That is why I'm in the bedroom. I want to be in bed!" she said, reaching over to place a hand on each of his thighs. "But do you mind if I lie down for a little time."</p> <p>~~~</p> <p>~~~</p> <p>Mari and Ryan sat on her bed, watching him. His hair was getting messed up and matted to the inside of his eyelids, his cheeks were so red that it appeared that his lip was stuck together. His lips were covered in red. "Wow. What did you do to me that bothered you?" He asked, taking his hand from underneath the blanket. It was soaked with her juices.</p> <p>~~~</p> <p>~~~</p> <p>Mari looked down from Ryan's chest to the back of her neckline where it covered her stomach. She took a moment to just admire the sight before biting at the collar of his shirt. It was a simple piece of fabric, but she knew it would stretch to fit her body. A little bit of her skin was showing. She ran her fingers along the back of his neck, tracing along the outline of his ear.</p> <p>"Mmm, you smell heavenly," she said.</p> <p>He smiled. "Let's get something to eat first, then call it a night."</p> <p>They made their way downstairs and down the hall that led to the kitchen. Mari led the way, stopping at the fridge.
