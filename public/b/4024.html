"I'm still ready to cum, babe. I want to watch your ass." I started sliding up and down, teasing him with my lips. I was able to get a little deeper with every stroke, and I was rewarded with a huge moan from him. By this time I was pounding him into the chair with each stroke. I was ready to explode myself, as I slid up onto my chest to lick his nipples, which seemed to drive him wild, he was grabbing the table for support of his hands and pinching my nipples just so they weren't going to fall out. I felt the first pulse of my orgasm, and as before, I kept stroking him and he kept cumming. After a couple of minutes, my breath was coming in short gasps and I started thrusting faster and harder into him. He was moaning and panting, his whole body seemed alive with heat and passion. My face was flush, his orgasm had just been so intense.</p> <p>"Baby, I'm about to cum," he gasped.</p> <p>"Cum for me, sweetheart," I cried and started jerking his cock just the way he likes when I'm getting ready to cum. I wanted to keep up but could feel him pulsing even faster and knew he was getting close. My hand went back to stroking him. It began to feel as if it would never stop. His cock twitched and jolted as his orgasm crashed through him. I felt his load go into my hand, and as I looked down at him, he looked up at me with wide eyes.</p> <p>"I don't think I've ever cum like that," he panted.</p> <p>"Me either," I purred.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful, baby."</p> <p>"You're the nicest thing I've ever seen."</p> <p>"That's good because I really think you're going to make me feel wonderful for the next few minutes."</p> <p>"That would be lovely."</p> <p>I leaned down to kiss him, and as our lips touched, I felt myself get instantly aroused again. This time, however, was different. This time his kiss was deeper and longer than earlier. I slid my tongue into his mouth. He wrapped his arms around me as my tongue danced with his. All the time, he couldn't move his hands, which had seemed to be all over my body. I was feeling totally possessed by the power of our first full kiss. I was aware of my thighs trembling and I knew, with my right hand gripping his chin, I felt lightheaded. He let his mouth slide from mine and started kissing my cheek again. His eyes were still closed and both of us were breathing heavy. "Come up to me and I'll show you what a good kisser I am," I whispered, and he rose up and stepped around me. I was still standing, looking down at him. Slowly he stepped up to me and we kissed once again. His hands went to my hips and he helped pull me to him. His lips were against mine again but this time his tongue found mine and was soon swirling around mine. I felt myself melting into him. I was feeling so sexy, he was feeling sexy too. He kissed me some more and whispered, "I want to see your ass, babe."</p> <p>"Just do whatever you like with me, and I'll let you do anything you want with me. Just do whatever feels good to you," I said softly. Then I looked him in the eyes and asked, "Does it feel good?"</p> <p>"Yes," he said, almost breathless with excitement.</p> <p>"Do you want me to take it off? Do you want me to pull it out?"</p> <p>"Yes, please, and it's alright," he cried. "I want to see everything."</p> <p>"Well, I'm sure you'll enjoy that," I answered. "But I don't want you pulling anything out."</p> <p>"If I was going to pull anything out of you, I'd want you to take it off too. Would you play with yourself for me?"</p> <p>"Baby," I said, "I want to see your finger in me." I looked down at his cock, which was beginning to twitch wildly. He watched me as if for approval, and his eyes were huge with anticipation of what was to come. My fingers were wrapped wetly around my clit. I used them to trace the crevice of my pussy until it was smooth. He looked disappointed when I held them up. "Just imagine what might happen if you ever took it out and stroked it while it was in you," I teased. He leaned forward and started kissing my inner thigh, which was now covered with the cream he left in the car for me.
