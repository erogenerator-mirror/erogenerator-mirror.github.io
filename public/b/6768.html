He grunted, then pushed his cock deeper into her throat and shot his load of cum deep inside her mouth.</p> <p>I pulled out slowly and then collapsed next to Emily. We were both shaking on the cool, damp grass and felt like we had just stepped from deep into an underwater movie.</p> <p>Finally, Emily stood up, kissed me on the cheek, then took my hand and led me out of the water.</p> <p>"Let's go skinny-dipping," Emily said.</p> <p>"Dude!" Liam said.</p> <p>"Yeah, that sounds great," I agreed.</p> <p>"Let's shower together before we go back in and party."</p> <p>"Okay," I said, feeling like I still owed it to her to just hang out with her for once.</p> <p>We took the elevator back to the party and the whole time Liam's eyes were glued on Emily. I glanced over to her and she had her head thrown back on Liam's shoulder and her nipples were still firmly erect. She had never looked more beautiful than that.</p> <p>We entered the small gathering area again, I looked over at the big party on the other side of the river and Liam seemed to like Emily as well. She hadn't given one word of apology and he didn't know how to be indifferent. He looked so vulnerable with his pants down around his ankles and his face turned up to me, grinning. When I asked him if I could dance to the music Emily had just danced with Liam, she'd stood him up for it then grabbed his hand and danced with him. He pulled her close, kissed her, cupped her ass in his hands. His hands roamed her body. His eyes seemed to linger forever over her ass.</p> <p>"Wow," he said when we got next to each other. "It's just like you said."</p> <p>"It's like us," I said, looking at the clock. "I didn't see you going inside."</p> <p>"That was only the second fucking time I've worn panties on a date," He said, then smiled at me.</p> <p>"That guy didn't put his dick in your pussy," I said.</p> <p>"Oh no. He just kissed and stroked his way through to my asshole. He's just as good a cocksucker as you are. He sure could make you come."</p> <p>We were both quiet, enjoying the moment of intimacy together. Finally Liam took Emily's hand and led her into the bathroom.</p> <p>The water was cold, not unlike the night outside. We stepped into the shower and washed each other slowly. I reached over her and she turned her head and kissed me long and deep. I cupped her breasts and pushed them together, feeling the slight sag of her breasts. The suds felt so good on the skin of her breasts.</p> <p>She reached down and cupped my cock, slowly stroking it. I reached around to squeeze her ass.</p> <p>"It's your turn," she said, her lips pressed against mine.</p> <p>Liam stepped out of the shower and I was suddenly afraid to look into her eyes. She looked so beautiful that I didn't want to let her go.</p> <p>"Can you tell me what to do?" she asked.</p> <p>"Just stay calm if you want," I cautioned.</p> <p>My mind raced. I never had an en-suite bathroom with Emily and Liam. I just hoped we got to her with no hard feelings; I wasn't sure it would have been so good without Liam. But it was pretty damn good. I washed down to her ass and washed the suds from it, then slowly kissed her neck and shoulders while still holding her firmly in my arms.</p> <p>When Liam and Emily stepped out of the shower, I handed Emily a towel from the bathroom.</p> <p>"Thanks," She said, still drying her body. "It's just so nice to see you."</p> <p>"Yeah, it is nice to be around you."</p> <p>She looked relieved and I was happy with that.</p> <p>"So, how does this work?" I asked.</p> <p>Emily shrugged. "Well, you don't even have to ask," she said. "It's all done before youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
