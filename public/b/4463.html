It's wonderful!"</p> <p>"Did you enjoy it?" she asked in return.</p> <p>"Hell yes I did. I feel good to have you so close."</p> <p>"We are almost through here, and I think you may be close as well." So they continued their kiss and then she started to undress him.</p> <p>"Do you have any plans for tomorrow?" she asked while they were still locked in a lip lock.</p> <p>"It's Friday afternoon, if you don't want to come, you can come the next two days."</p> <p>"But I don't have that sort of freedom in the afternoon. I'm not sure how well I'd recover!"</p> <p>"So just enjoy the ride."</p> <p>"Well, I think I just did!"</p> <p>She kissed him again, and then she slipped the key back in the ignition. "It's back on now, we are just off to drive to the club. So you can just relax, while I take care of the rest."</p> <p>"I'm sure it will be a lot of fun."</p> <p>"Come on, let's go." he said, taking her hand and pulling her to him by the hand.</p> <p>They continued kissing for another few minutes, when she finally stepped out of his clothes, and then guided him into the bedroom. He laid her back on the bed and she sat up to kiss him again. He took her right nipple between his fingers, and she held his face to hers as he sucked on it. Her head fell back, and she moaned as he continued to lick along its entire length. It soon grew even larger when he slid a finger deep into her. He added another finger, and then he switched them up with his.</p> <p>"Oh, God, I love this," she panted as he started to finger her hard and fast.</p> <p>"I can't last much longer."</p> <p>"Oh God! I want you inside. I want to cum in your mouth, and then you can let me lick you up. Can you do that for me?" she panted.</p> <p>"As long as you are willing to do that, of course I will!" he told her, kissing her again.</p> <p>She leaned forward and they were both surprised at just how eager they were for each other. She kissed him again then kissed his chest and stomach before she made her way downward. She gently stroked her hand over his engorged cock, which soon became fully erect again. She kissed her way across his cock and then down to his balls. She took each of them in her mouth. She stroked his shaft with her hand and then let it slide out of her mouth. She licked her lips slowly.</p> <p>"I know it's been awhile for you, baby." she told him.</p> <p>"It's been a long time too, especially since we started here!"</p> <p>"I know! Did you have a lot of fun?" she asked with a sly smile.</p> <p>"I'm glad you are having fun. I was beginning to worry about what you might want!"</p> <p>She smiled and then knelt on the bed next to him, and took his cock into her mouth. She sucked him in deeply, then out again. She moved up and kissed him. Their mouths locked together, their tongues were caressing each other while she sucked on her husband's cock the way she so dearly loves to and he continued to stroke her and stroke himself. After an eternity they broke the kiss and he lay back. She moved down beside him and slid on top of him, her body on top of his. She kissed him long and sweetly, savoring the taste and scent of him. She slid up, and then back down slowly. Each motion was as soft as the last. She kissed her way down his chest, stomach, belly, and then she felt him move against his upper chest. She looked down and saw him, still erect, as he positioned his head between her legs. She looked into his eyes as his head slid into her. Then he began to move his whole body, and she let her legs fall to the sides of his body. She wrapped her legs around his lower body, and then lifted her hips in the air, allowing her to take him deeper into her.</p> <p>As she lifted her hips again, he began to slowly withdraw his shaft from her tight, moist passage, but this time she held herself in place. Soon she could feel him moving deep inside her. Again the pace began to quicken. She was close to yet another orgasm - the way she likes to be when she likes this is usually very good. She raised herself up and started to move again, so very slowly - up and down, in and out - and then up again. As always she started very slowly, and as she built to thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
