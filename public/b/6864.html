She pulled him inside the room where she had taken off her shoes and put on her own clothes. She told him she got his shirt on. While lying on a bed she went to the restroom and opened the stall on the left side. As she pulled it open she got the last of her things from the stall next to it. She slipped on her own sandals one at a time before getting up and locking the stall door. She walked back to the bed taking off her sandals. She smiled at herself in the mirror as she undid her blouse and slid the sleeves off her arms, allowing it to drop off and hang up on her arms.</p> <p>She slid the shirt off and stepped into the room. He hadn't noticed the bed as she came into the room. He watched her walk back to the bed. She stopped before removing her skirt, sliding the leather undergarment down over her hips. A smile came to her face as she watched him sit back to enjoy his view. She lifted her legs slightly showing him her bare feet and his cock began to swell in his briefs.</p> <p>She slipped a stocking on each of her knees before climbing onto the bed and kneeling next to him. Her skirt was around her waist as her lips came closer to his ear. Her lips touched his ear and neck with each touch. The kiss seemed to last forever as his thoughts clouded over briefly. She stopped, "I think we need to get more comfortable."</p> <p>He could hear the rustle of the sheets and he couldn't help but feel nervous.</p> <p>As the silence lingered she said, "Now, I want you to touch me." She reached out and put a hand on his shoulder to guide him to her pussy. As she was sliding down, he rubbed her ass and massaged her cheeks between his fingers. He continued to rub her pussy as she lay on his chest. The softness of her hand on him sent sensations through him. A few more strokes and he could feel that he was about to cum. She could feel him getting harder in his pants that was already making her pussy twitch.</p> <p>Suddenly he let her up and she said, "You have to wear the bra. I want to feel what it would be like if the bra was in there."</p> <p>As he was saying this and looking at the clock above the dresser he started to unbutton his shirt. She stood before him looking at him. After unbuttoning and reaching for the bra strap, she put both hands up and pulled him down to her and kissed him. He responded with equal passion and then pulled her bra strap free, pulled it and threw it away; then grabbed the other strap holding her bra and threw it also. A smile crossed her face and she reached for his belt and undid it. As his trousers dropped to the floor her hands flew to his hard cock that was quickly filling and rising toward release. He broke their kiss to watch; she held his cock through the fabric of his pants. "Let me get these off."</p> <p>She stepped back from his chair pulling his pants down past his cock and letting him take off the pants. As she stepped back she let her eyes stay on this man, this very sexy lady who had to be her. This sexy creature whom was standing before her, letting her eyes continue to roam over her body. She put one hand on the top of his head pressing his face into her pussy, moaning and gasping as his tongue licked her pussy and then his tongue slipped inside her hole. His tongue found one of her hard clit rings. Her hips rose up in response to the touch of his tongue. He could smell the odor of her desire. Her fingers were still holding on to his head and one on her breasts. She had one nipple between her index and middle finger and started to slowly caress her breast.</p> <p>She took his hand from her pussy, brought it to her head and took his finger. She ran his finger tip along the sides of her breasts; then pulled back to give him room to slide more of his finger inside her. When her pussy moved against his finger she looked him in the eyes and said, "That's great." As she took his finger out she slowly sucked it, smiling at how eager he was to feel it again.</p> <p>She dropped to her feet again. "Show me your pants." She told as she reached her hand out to a drawer. As he approached her with his shirt off she said, "Slow down."</p> <p>He saw her hands were covered in her own juices as she removed his shirt. She then laid him back on the bed and undid the remaining buttons. Her hands fanned out across the front of the thin white shirt. He watched as she finished pulling off the blouse to get the first of many buttons.
