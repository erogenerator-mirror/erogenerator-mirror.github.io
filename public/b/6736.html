"Well, we'll see." With that, I grabbed his right hand and placed it on top of my now erect cock just above the opening.</p> <p>The moment I had anticipated, this wasn't the first time she had taken the head of my cock in her mouth, though I had been prepared to do something about it, so I was just not sure how she would react to it. But she seemed to understand as she looked up into my eyes as the head of my cock poked and bobbed in and out of her mouth.</p> <p>"You like that?" She finally asked with a playful look which told me she knew what I was about to do next.</p> <p>"You know I do," I answered, though she seemed to accept it and start to nod her head up and down as I guided my cock down her throat. Her eyes were locked on mine as I forced my cock to the other side of her lips, where the head was poised just above her teeth. "Yeah, go ahead," I continued as I pushed forward once more, the head of my cock going passed her lips once more as I stopped.</p> <p>Looking down, I saw that she was still staring at my cock, even though the cock was already in her mouth. Her eyes moved down to see what I was doing while I placed both fingers at her pussy. There was already a large wet spot already forming on the bed. "I'll tell you what, put your finger in." Not wanting to miss any of her first experience as one to enjoy, my middle finger easily slid into the wetness of her pussy until it was pressing against her g-spot. She bucked involuntarily as I pumped my middle finger in and out of her cunt.</p> <p>"Do you like it, baby?" I said in response, pulling the finger out and putting it into her mouth. "Do you like the taste of that?"</p> <p>"I love it," she answered, "I'm not gay."</p> <p>"I know," I said, moving her mouth back to my cock once again, "I saw the way you looked at it this morning all day. You liked me to do that." My finger was now in her cunt, pressing firmly against her most sensitive spot.</p> <p>"Ohh," she groaned, "you're gonna make me cum," I thought to myself, pulling my wet finger from her body. "Do you want to cum now, baby?" She just nodded her head as I slipped my finger into her mouth. "Come on, baby," I urged, "do it." She didn't have much option in answering but to do what I wanted. My cock just slid past her lips as she closed her mouth, my hand still pressing against her g-spot. I placed my free hand on the bed next to her head and guided her face up and down. I continued fucking her with my hand as I saw her eyes roll back and the back of her neck go slack as she reached her pinnacle. Then looking at me as I had just done, she smiled as her head remained on the pillow, eyes closed as she concentrated on cumming as many times as she could stand it and I knew she was going to find it difficult to hold back.</p> <p>As she came, I pulled my finger out of her pussy and slipped it down on her stomach, pressing it against her clit. I could feel the soft skin of her stomach as she started to moan. I continued pressing my digit into her as her hips jerked forward against my hand. The pressure from my fingers felt unbelievable and I continued to push them in and out of her cunt, now covered in her cum. I had never fucked anyone into a position or made her cum before, a place she was definitely ready to experience something like this with. Once she felt she had found her stride, I pulled her back towards me.</p> <p>"Here," I told her, still using the fingers of my hand to continue to fuck her cunt while my mouth pressed against her pussy lips again, "I'm gonna put your cock in my mouth now." She didn't hesitate as she grabbed at my hard cock, looking it up and down from her place between her legs, "Let's get you on your back so we can kiss as I suck you off."</p> <p>She didn't need a second invitation. In a flash, I was on top of her without waiting to be asked, kissing her passionately while she wrapped her arms and legs around me. Her lips moved to my neck, where she nibbled and sucked as I kissed my way down to her neck. As her hands moved to my ass to squeeze it hard, I knew she was ready to explode so I slid my hand toward her entrance. She quickly slid her lips back up in response, then slid her tongue between my lips.</p> <p>"Mmmm," she moâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
