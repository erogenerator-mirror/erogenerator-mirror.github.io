It was a strong one, and I was going to lose count, but I needed more. I needed to feel fuller than I have been lately. I felt the wave of euphoria roll from my head up at my core. As I continued to feel the pulsating in my clit, a new wave of ecstasy surged through me, and I let out a little scream. The feelings as my walls clenched around the cock inside me created a flood of warmth. It wasn't enough for me, and the sensation of pleasure was overpowering. As I felt my cum squirt over my fingers, and the cock inside of me began to pulse, I released in an almost non-existent orgasm of my own.</p> <p>I couldn't keep myself from crying out, "Oh God, I...so...God...so...yes...yes...yes! Ooh God, I'm coming again!"</p> <p>I could feel my own cum gushing into the fingers inside of me as I moaned out, "Uh...umm...oh...God...so...oh...God."</p> <p>It was a huge relief, that I didn't want to pass out, and that I wanted me to feel that sensation again. As my body finished spasming, I just lay there, gasping, with the fingers inside of me sliding all the way out. The cock inside of me remained inside of me for as long as I could stand it, but as soon as I'd recovered, it slipped out of me. This orgasm was what I needed, and I needed another helping of that. I needed to be filled full. I had to find a way not to feel this pleasure. I couldn't move. I couldn't move.</p> <p>I was afraid that this would bring me to my peak, and I knew that I couldn't stand it. When a light came on I knew that it would turn on, and I jumped forward. As I stood, I felt the cock pushing into me again. That was the idea; I could keep this, and be free as well.</p> <p>When the light turned on, I was shocked, at the realization that the light had not come to life. I could not believe it! I felt my walls begin to give up, and I began to fall to the floor. When the light finally came on, I realized that I had just been fucked by someone, and I was not going anywhere for a week, or a week. I had no place to go. All I could think of was how fucking this man had felt inside of me, inside of my mouth, in my ass, inside of my vagina. As I stood, I realized I must have passed out.</p> <p>When I came to, I was sitting on the couch, naked, with a full ass of someone. It was Bill, and he was sitting back naked beside me. But he had a large, beautiful cock. What the hell was going on? It was too big.</p> <p>I began to say, "No! Let me go."</p> <p>He looked up at me, and simply said, "If you're not going anywhere, I'm going to make you cum again."</p> <p>I just had to say it more desperately. I tried to smile, and laugh, because I was no laughingstock like when I got this job, and I was still too weak.</p> <p>I leaned over and kissed him, and said, "Now, Bill, please untie me. I can't give you the pleasure of having me go out the next day."</p> <p>"You can do better than that," he said just above a whisper. "That will make you more available for me tonight."</p> <p>I was about to ask where he could possibly make me, and just how to get to him, when he turned me around, and said, "You want to try a little bondage, don't you?"</p> <p>I just stood there, not knowing what to say. I had no other choice. I did what either of us wanted. I simply said, "Yes."</p> <p>I felt Bill get up and untie my feet, and then he told me to get on all fours. I felt him rub something onto my anus, and then I felt something push against my anus. I didn't know what was coming, but all I wanted to do was moan to be more than just a finger in my pussy. "You ready for me to fuck you back there?" He asked.</p> <p>"I'm ready for you," I replied.</p> <p>He pushed it into me. I was so wet, it got in easy, but this didn't feel good. I tried to say, "No, Please, not now," and he simply said, "No."</p> <p>I wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
