I'm starving!"</p> <p>"Great thanks."</p> <p>"Oh I'm sorry, I didn't mean to embarrass you. It just took me a minute."</p> <p>She's smiling like she's happy that he said the right thing.</p> <p>"Sorry I guess. If I'm not going to eat, you might have to eat something else, I'm not sure how."</p> <p>"No, no, don't chicken out of your plate. If you know how to eat you won't have to. I bet you've been dying to have your pussy eaten!"</p> <p>"Well, I didn't know that. It just seems like a bad habit to have hanging over your head, I guess."</p> <p>"Really sweetie, I wouldn't do that. I can't afford to leave with you for a while."</p> <p>There it was. It was finally making sense. She's finally getting to know him. She's finally going to get to experience the wild side of the man he's talking about. She's just waiting for the right moment to break free.</p> <p>The bell rings and the hostess comes running over to say something to her. He sits back down to his usual bar stools and looks out for just a second as he drinks his beer to try to warm his nerves. He hears her say something to the hostess but he just sits there and sips his beer as he waits for the hostess.</p> <p>"Do you mind if I come right back here" she asks, motioning for him to get up. The hostess comes back with a look of surprise on her face when he makes his presence known to her and that she is expecting him. In fact, she's practically drooling as she takes his chair, her breasts straining against her tiniest top, and is obviously breathing heavy and staring straight ahead.</p> <p>"Umm, no...sure."</p> <p>The hostess leans over and gives him a quick kiss on the cheek.</p> <p>"Good. So, this lady likes you, isn't she? It seems you really are hungry!"</p> <p>He smiles at her and she begins to stand up off her stool, her breasts pressed against his arm.</p> <p>"No, I was just teasing. You know how I live."</p> <p>"Yeah, I know the truth!"</p> <p>"No, no, I'm not going anywhere. We just finished our lunch. I was just telling you that you need to eat something and then I'll get you out of here on a plate."</p> <p>"Oh, you have my lunch already!"</p> <p>"Oh that's not going very well," he says, his face flustered. She gives him a look like she can't believe he's finally caught her naked on the sidewalk.</p> <p>"Is your wife in?"</p> <p>"No...we just finished lunch. She's just out for lunch."</p> <p>"Well, you still have two minutes left, so come with me!"</p> <p>She follows him from the bar, stopping just before the door and letting him close it behind his chair.</p> <p>He takes her hand, leading her out to the back garden. There isn't much to see outside, not any more than a small patch of shade where she can see up into the forest in the distance. He puts his arms around her, giving her back a loving squeeze.</p> <p>"I couldn't stop thinking about you. It seems to me that you are the sexiest, most desirable woman I've been with, too. You're beautiful and I wanted to be with you forever. I've never been one for big beautiful women, especially not you."</p> <p>Her smile lights up his entire face. He kisses her forehead then begins kissing her eyelids and her cheek while his hands roam all over her body. Her back arches as he lightly runs his fingertips across her breasts. They are both breathing heavily; his lips are sucking a little harder, his tongue moving around the inside of her mouth. Her hands caress his shoulders and arms as she turns them, sliding lower to his chest so that his chest is against the smooth satiny fabric.</p> <p>He kisses over her chin and down toward her neck. She leans back into him, her hips rocking against his as the fabric caresses her bare thighs. His hands glide up her body as his kisses start to travel from her chin to her neck until he reaches her collarbone and he gently kisses the hollow that lead down her bare neck. He continues on up until he reaches her ear. Each breath is his lover's and the only sound in the forest he kisses is the soft sounds of nature, and the soft, delicious sound of her moan as her bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
