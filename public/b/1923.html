I have nothing better to do and we could be interrupted. And please don't ask me to do anything that I wont approve of, sir. I will do whatever your needs. I promise."</p> <p>He sat back in his easy chair and reached out to take her hand in both of his. "Don't do anything you don't want to do, sweetie." His arms circled her again. "I don't need to make things unpleasant. Just enjoy yourself here. I'm just not sure we'll find what you really want or need."</p> <p>She blushed and looked slightly downcast. "Yes sir."</p> <p>He leaned in and hugged her. "You have a lovely warm body underneath all of the clothes you wear with it." Her arms stayed around him and he leaned his head up to look her in the eyes. "If we can't find what we are looking for, then we can go someplace a little more familiar."</p> <p>"No, do not do anything without my consent."</p> <p>He took her hand again and moved her so that she was standing up and out of his arms. "Now, let's go get us our clothes and we can go someplace that we don't have to hide ourselves while I make the selections." he said as he led her to the door, and out of his office.</p> <p>He was disappointed at how quickly they got back there and he turned and hurriedly followed her into their bedroom, closing the door quickly behind them before she could be seen.</p> <p>She felt his presence with his warm arms and his body against hers, pressing up against her and they kissed as their hands explored.</p> <p>His mouth and tongue worked wonders and she found herself returning it as he opened the buttons on her blouse slowly. He slowly licked her hard nipples before his fingers wrapped around them and squeezed them firmly. She gasped as his fingers moved down to her warm belly and as he lifted himself up, so that she could see what had become erect. "You have a lovely body under all that clothes I'm thinking of doing so much more to you." he murmured before he continued on his path south.</p> <p>Her blouse opened completely and her bra dropped to the floor, leaving her naked in front of him. "Oh my." she gasped, as he looked deep into her sparkling eyes.</p> <p>Her breasts were soft yet round in his hands and he gently kneaded them in his hands. Taking his thumbs and forefingers, he lightly pulled at her nipples and she felt them harden further under his touch. Moving her so that she was kneeling on the bed, he quickly undid his pants and let them drop to the floor, leaving herself kneeling at the end of the bed. He looked at her intently and bent his head to her chest and took one of her breasts into his mouth and swirled his tongue around the nipple. Her hips pushed up slightly in response and she sighed again as he sucked upon her erect nipple.</p> <p>She leaned back onto the bed; her hands running over his short dark hair. "Oh, please, please ..." she panted as his hands and mouth continued their assault upon her breasts, running over the muscles of her abdomen to the wet skin she had already started to run along her thigh.</p> <p>Rocking his hips, he lowered his body onto hers and as their lips parted, he slid into her, sinking his length deep within her body. His hips began to work their way slowly up and down in her slick warmness, taking her time to savor each contact. Her legs began to tighten and she tried to arch her knees up higher so that her heels would caress his ass.</p> <p>She felt his hands grasp at her hips and lift her bodily up to meet his. Her arms were wrapped around his neck and they rocked slowly and deliberately against each other's bodies. The sound of their coupling grew more intense until both of them were humping and thrusting together, moaning and crying out. They held each other tightly and their movements continued until they both experienced intense climaxes. Both stopped their movements then rolled over so that she was on top of him. She kissed down his chest and stomach while his hands cupped her behind, his finger ran over the moist flesh. She felt her wetness again and began kissing her way up his stomach.</p> <p>"Oh my, sweetheart," she whispered when she reached the very place that had caused her so much pleasure and she licked her lips as she thought about it. "Will I ever do this to you again?"</p> <p>She leaned down and kissed his mouth. "Please, do it. If I can please you this morning, but please, do what I say." She pulled back from his embrace and kissed him again. "Anything you want."</p> <p>"Okay.
