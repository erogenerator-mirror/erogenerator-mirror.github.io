"A man's got to... "</p> <p>I stopped my words, for some reason. She didn't want to hear me talk. I knew it in my bones.</p> <p>"Yes..." she whispered.</p> <p>"Yes, what?"</p> <p>"Yes.</p> <p>"I'm getting close..." she said, staring between my legs at her clit, which had almost a second's pause in its pulsing as I watched it. She opened her eyes, slowly. "Is there something you want to ask?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes." She said. "What's on your mind?" She smiled, her eyes still closed, as she spoke to herself. "You want to fuck me."</p> <p>"Yes." I agreed. "But I'm not sure if it's what you want to do."</p> <p>"No," she said, smiling back at me. "It wouldn't be like... we can't."</p> <p>She was right, but I felt a twinge of fear as she said it. What if she really was a dirty old-fashioned whore? I felt stupid that I had let her talk like this. But if I were a pervert in front of her I might be able to convince myself so to speak that she was the perfect woman.</p> <p>I was a lucky bastard.</p> <p>She was still looking at her clit and it looked like it had even faster. "It would be nice if we could do something."</p> <p>"Anything!" I repeated, wanting to get back between her legs. "Do you want to feel my dick inside of you?"</p> <p>"Yes," she said, taking my cock into her hand and pumping my shaft up and down. "I've wondered if there were another... "</p> <p>"Oh!" I croaked, surprised how wet this girl actually was.</p> <p>"But there are a lot of other... things... we won't be able to... "</p> <p>"You won't think of anything else?" I asked, genuinely curious.</p> <p>"Absolutely not..." she said, with a devilish grin. She pulled my cock toward her with one hand, pointing it down toward her clit, then down again, making a tenting of the inside of her robe. The folds of her cunt were shiny from the wetness. I could practically make out the pink of her hole underneath, opening and closing and shivering from the pressure of my cock.</p> <p>"Well, are you going to put it in?" I asked her.</p> <p>"No," came her reply. "I can't." She moved forward, letting my dick slide up into her cunt.</p> <p>It was not exactly easy for me, though my member was a bit tender and sore, so my own feelings of pleasure were not so much. "Does it hurt?" I asked.</p> <p>"Oh yes!" she said. "All the way... "</p> <p>For a moment, all of her words seemed inaudible, until I saw her face. It was a little bit of pure beauty. Her eyes were like sapphires, or emeralds, twinkling in the glow of the light. There was the slightest hint of a smile on her face, but the lips I imagined were not really smiling any more.</p> <p>"Will it hurt?" she asked. "Will I... be able to... make you... " she trailed off, looking down at my cock. "Do you want to fuck me?" It was something new, to use these words, even though I had previously thought they were silly even. She didn't have any problem with me.</p> <p>"Oh yes..." I said. If I could do that, I would certainly be a good master. It was my first time since coming to my room.</p> <p>"Then I want you to... make love to me," she said, her voice breathy, and full of life. "I mean take me to bed. I want you to make love to me like no other woman ever has done. I've wanted this for so long..."</p> <p>She held my cock in her hand, pressing it against her pussy. It was a little bit rough, despite its warm state of arousal. It was actually nice. "Do you really want to fuck me?"</p> <p>"Yes..." I said, thinking I had no problem getting her to bed, which she did. She was so wet that the head of my member slid in with a lot of resistance. She pulled back a bit, so I could see her face. "Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yes..." she said, holding my cock so I couldn't move it, which was much easier than it took.
