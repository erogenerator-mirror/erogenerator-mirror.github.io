He was taking possession of me. My body shook; I had almost gone off without any stimulation. At this moment, I was ready for life; my body was on fire and my mind was in a haze. He lifted himself over me. I closed my eyes and waited. He smiled when a warm breath blew over my swollen nipples and between my spread thighs. Slowly, he licked them. I moaned. He took my left nipple between his thumb and forefinger and began to roll the hardened nub. My hand stroked his head. His tongue flicked rapidly on my nipple and then around and around my now hard and sensitive nubbin. I felt it swell and become more prominent in my chest. When I closed my eyes, I knew that I needed release. That he may release me was what I sought. But I also sensed that there was more. My body became hot with anticipation. I could not wait. He continued to tease my nipple between his lips and tongue. I knew I needed him. I needed it now!!! I had to take it. In the last breath of my night, what I craved was him to consume me. I needed to feel him inside me. The need overcame all my resistance. As he continued to flick and suck on my breast, I pushed him aside. I slid over him, spread my legs and raised and opened myself for him. My hand guided his cock and balls through the thin, silky material of his boxers and underwear. He groaned as he felt the hot, moist flesh of my lips surround the length of his cock. It took a full minute before I could feel him pulsate, his cock pulse and throb within my depths.</p> <p>He lowered his head and started to lap at my lips where they led to my core. As fast as he could, he used his tongue to trace the length of my love canal before plunging his tongue inside me. I lifted my hips to meet his tongue as he laved my pussy with his lips. His hands massaged my ass and played roughly with my inner cheeks. He used his fingers to pull and tug on my labia while his tongue explored my insides. He moved his mouth upward to where the skin of both cheeks met. I felt his tongue trace its way over my anus. It was too sensitive. He moved back for more contact then resumed where he left off.</p> <p>He slid his shaft between my lips again and plunged it against my entrance. I pushed against him and the entire length of his cock was now inside me. I could feel him deep within. I was fully on his penis. He stopped for a moment reveling in the feeling of being completely enclosed, completely impaled in my depths.</p> <p>“I hope that my love,” he whispered to me. He eased my legs up toward my chest where they spread, inviting him to enter me. Again, he plunged his cock deep into me and began a rhythmic fucking motion.</p> <p>I took him as deeply as possible. He seemed to swell in my hand and I knew that he would soon, if not yet, ejaculate in my hand. I wanted him to empty himself deep in me and I knew a climax would be inevitable. I pulled his face to mine and said, “Make me cum,” then kissed him softly on the lips. “I want to see you…” I whispered, “Crawl over here and look in my hand,” I directed him in the direction of a small mirror.</p> <p>When he crawled across the bed, his cock and balls remained tightly encased in the opening of his boxers, waiting, impatiently, in waiting, anticipating. He looked at the small mirror and was rewarded with the image that I had desired. He slid the opening of his boxers down and his hard cock sprang free, pointing straight out from his body and waving with each step he took. He watched his cock with fascination as it rose and fell over his belly, and then back up. He had not cum yet as he moved to the small mirror that was positioned there where he could see what he saw.</p> <p>He leaned forward and took his cock in his hand again. Holding to the base, he brought his mouth to the head of his cock and placed his lips over it. He began the process again with one hand but now, he took the shaft in one hand and placed a kiss on the head. “That’s the head,” he said.</p> <p>I kissed all along the head. He was now moaning at the idea of his beautiful cock being played. As his cock was kissing the head, I took it between my lips in one hand and moved it in a circle around his cock-head. I heard a soft little "Ahhhhhhhhh" when his cock was enveloped by my lips.
