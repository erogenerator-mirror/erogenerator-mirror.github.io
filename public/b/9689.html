"Because I'm a slut." I grinned at what she said, although, truthfully, it wasn't entirely accurate. I suppose this could have been a sign of my ability to get my point across. I had never told anyone what we shared before our encounter, nor had I ever tried to convince others that we were as open about it as we were, or as open about it as we were about my previous relationship. In the past, a person's relationship was still open, and my own had been open. I had never felt this strongly about another person and never had felt this vulnerable to them. Perhaps the fact that my mother was a whore and a whore's mom, also showed that there was some very fundamental level between them as my mother. Maybe, the fact that I was a closet dominant and it was my sister that made him the dominant one, or, more likely, my wife had somehow become the submissive one, or, yes, had become the dominant one.</p> <p>At the very least, she might know that her sexual submissiveness was a thing that I truly had to understand, or find someone else who might provide that insight. In that sense, she may just know that what we shared had caused me to have an exhibitionist streak. My wife, on the other hand, might be too open about this experience. We had been trying to keep her honest, because at least for the sake of my relationship with my sister, it might be fun to talk about her experiences. Perhaps I would have had a good time with her if I didn't have some of the same kind of exhibitionist tendencies I did.</p> <p>That didn't hold any water, so I had to find some other outlet. I took my bra and panties with me, and, as we drove along, I had the desire to run my hands over myself, feel that delicious skin, and tell her how aroused I was. As we headed to bed for the night, I couldn't resist caressing my breast with the heel of my hand. Then, remembering the night before, I remembered the way my mom had stared at my body while I was eating her pussy. I felt my own wetness and was tempted to get up and start masturbating immediately, just to tease myself some more. We'd made love earlier and she was so tight and wet. It may have helped arouse me to no end, but it was a little too soon for me to take that step. Then, once there was sleep, I started to rub my body. I was very wet. It was also very wet because of the conversation we'd had. Maybe this was the wrong time to share my sister's information, but what difference would it make.</p> <p>I was still feeling aroused and aroused when the bed creaked, and she whispered, "We shouldn't."</p> <p>"Why?" I asked. "You told me you've been sexually active for years."</p> <p>"My sister doesn't like me being there," she answered. "I can't go as far as she does, and maybe it will never happen again."</p> <p>I couldn't imagine her wanting to have sex, but I was still very sexually aroused. What if I said no, and left her there and went back to our house. Her admission had my heart pounding, and I had the sense that she didn't want me to leave.</p> <p>"We can't do that," she said. "We can't take the chance."</p> <p>"What makes you say that?" I asked. "You might be in the 'nights' mood."</p> <p>"I don't know," she said. "I mean, I'm not ready for that just yet." I realized that this might never happen, and that I needed to get a hold of myself. I realized how much fun that thought was, and how much I needed to do it. Then, I decided to do it. So, I started to unbutton my shirt and slip it off. I was tempted to turn around and take it off, but I didn't. When the shirt was off, I thought that I might be losing it, but then realized that maybe my shirt had somehow gotten caught in the strap of my bra. When I bent down to pull it off, I knew that my breasts were in the clear, which meant that they really were.</p> <p>As I reached for the catch, she said, "No." I felt her pull the cups down with my arms. My breasts were encased in a bra. They were very firm and looked good without the bra.</p> <p>"We can't," she said. "What about your bra?" I felt my shirt being unholstered, and I thought it might be awkward. I wasn't sure if I should try to remove my bra or try to get it on so we could both get on with the day. â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
