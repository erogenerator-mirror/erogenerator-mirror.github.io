Then she led him into the bathroom where a small walk-in closet was to use. She turned on the shower and turned it on; then she took the robe and tied it around her, and then she walked him into her bedroom and left him standing by the bed. She then left the bathroom and closed the door, then she left the door open.</p> <p>She stepped across the room into the bathroom; then she turned on the shower and stepped in, closing the shower door behind her. She turned on the water and stepped under the warm soapy water, letting it soothe her as she soaked up the warmth in between her legs. She leaned against the wall for a moment, then she began to rub the water all over her body.</p> <p>She worked her breasts and belly in the water; rubbing it into the firm muscles of her stomach and hips. She moved to her thighs and worked the soap into them. She could feel herself getting excited as he rubbed up against her. She slid her hands up and down her thighs, then to her stomach, then back to her breasts as she felt for those soft tender breasts. She slid one hand down her body, and then into the soapy water. She began to run her fingers over her belly, then her pussy, then her ass.</p> <p>Then she pushed down on her right shoulder, forcing her breast upwards. There was also a bit of moisture; so as she slipped her fingernail along the edge of her pussy lips, she slid the fingers of her other hand in alongside the first one. She worked her fingers in and out of himself, then she slid them into her ass. And then she began to pull at her pussy and squeeze her tits as she worked over them, and her own fingers. She worked her palm over the lips of her pussy and her thumb over her clit. As her hands worked her body, she reached out between her legs to stroke his cock, which was standing proudly and upright against his body, waiting for her to take it into her mouth.</p> <p>After a few moments of this teasing and playing, she pushed him down on the bed. She stood with her own legs on the bed in front of him and ran her fingers over his body, caressing him as far as they could reach, then she stroked his cock faster and faster. She bent over him, placing her hands on his chest as she worked her body towards a climax, and she rubbed against him with the same motions. She felt her body tighten as he came first, and as he released his cum into his cock, she moaned.</p> <p>"I love your hand on me," she whispered, as she leaned back against him. Slowly she raised herself off then, feeling the wetness of his cum on her skin. She looked into his eyes as she pulled up the covers from the bed and pulled on the robe again, buttoning it up. She had to do a very quick quick hand job to get her self out of these wet clothes. She took another glance in his eyes; seeing the longing there, and she put her hand over his to hold it there. They kissed again, lingering a bit longer this time. Finally she stood up and put her nightgown on.</p> <p>Then she turned back to her husband and, taking his now flaccid cock in her hand, she led him by it to the shower. She sat him down in the shower as she knelt down in the water. With her back to him, she let the water rush over her breasts. He watched as her ass came into view, then he saw her head going down to suck the water off her breasts, and he knew what was to come. Then she turned around to let the water drip over her back. He got his arms around her from behind so he could hold her. He started to kiss over her back as she moved her body against him. He was so hard and his cock was throbbing under her hands. She took his hand behind him, guiding it between her legs and then she bent her body at the waist as he slid into her. Then she lay down on him, kissing him, while her hands rubbed up and down her body.</p> <p>As she felt the fullness of him in and out of her, she ran her hands over his body again. Then she reached behind to stroke and run her fingers over his cock and then down to his balls, rubbing all over him. She found his ass with her other hands, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
