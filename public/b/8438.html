His fingers brushed against her cheek. "We cannot go far, my lady. We will arrive soon enough."</p> <p>"Oh, good, I must look forward to seeing you again."</p> <p>"Of course," he answered. His lips brushed the side of her neck. "We shall see."</p> <p>*****</p> <p>The night was beautiful; it had been years since she had been out on a regular adventure, and this was the first time with another, her own body having been the first to experience the blissful pleasure they had already shared together. They had enjoyed the night they were apart, but had not planned, just enjoyed each other as only lovers of the same species can, and it had been just fine. It had not been long before the sun was rising again, and they lay kissing with her hands wrapped lovingly around his waist. He stroked her hair as she ran her fingers through it, running them down his bare back. He kissed her mouth gently, then, and he took off her hat. She looked on as he carefully and slowly took off his shirt, and he smiled as the sunlight revealed his dark-haired head and small chest. He reached behind her head, letting his rough hands stroke her body as he unhooked her hat and slid it off her head. His hands caressed her body again, tracing her neck down the center of her chest until he had found her nipple. He caressed it gently for a few moments, pinched it gently and then pulled it away with his mouth. She shuddered as his teeth gently nibbled on it. He looked down at her body. Her large breasts were full and round, and the skin looked incredibly smooth and flawless. He traced his hand over her stomach and slowly, sensuously slid his finger down between her legs. She gasped as he touched her sex, and her legs opened wider as he slowly pushed two fingers into her body. She bit her lip and held her breath as he continued his exploration. He slowly and teasingly touched the sides of her hips, up her sides and down her arms. She gasped and he grinned as she moaned as he lightly ran his fingers over her lips, teasing them and playing with them so teasingly aroused her.</p> <p>He broke their kiss and leaned up to kiss her again, pulling her body up to meet his. He pushed her head down on the pillow, laying her face down on the sheets so he could see her face. He held his cock for her to see, and slowly as he stroked his hand up and down it. He smiled against her skin, feeling her warm breath on his shaft as her lips touched, and the sensation of the softness on top had him growing even harder. He watched her lips as they covered his cock and the head popped inside.</p> <p>She held his cock in her soft hand as she looked up the length of him, her tongue wetting the soft skin of his shaft as she slowly rubbed it over the soft insides of her lips.</p> <p>"Oh, god," he moaned.</p> <p>After a few moments of this, though, he picked up the pace, sliding his fingers back and forth over her lips, wetting them as he stroked himself in and out of her mouth. He pushed forward so he could feel how wet she was, and he felt his cock move a little as he fucked her tight little mouth. This was different every time she took his cock between her lips, and it made him crazy to be inside her mouth and her pussy at the same time.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," Eric said, smiling up at her. He ran his fingertip over her nipples to play with them before sucking them into his mouth as he continued fucking her mouth.</p> <p>"God, yeah," she murmured. Her pussy tightened as he sucked her breasts deep into his mouth, then he switched to the other. His lips played with her nipples, making them even more sensitive and she moaned as she played with his cock. And then she began to arch her back against him as she neared her climax.</p> <p>"Oh, fuck yes," Eric moaned. He ran his fingertip over her sex. She was almost there right then.</p> <p>He knew it was okay to go ahead and finger her right there, just as long as it took him to. But, she didn't care where, and neither bothered him anyhow. As soon as she touched his cock, he could feel it tighten inside her mouth.</p> <p>"Are you ready for me to cum in your pretty little mouth?" Eric asked teasingly, and she groaned in agreement before he could speak. He knew she wouldâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
