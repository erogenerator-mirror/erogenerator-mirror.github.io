Rachel said, still pulling her skirt up, "You don't understand."</p> <p>"But I think I do! I really do...," I said, suddenly feeling as though I had a fever.</p> <p>She said, "You're going to be sleeping with me tonight, not your Mom or Dad! Not any one else's..."</p> <p>She was right; I didn't understand her reaction. I didn't like it. So she turned and slipped upstairs without another word or even a look at me. I ran to the kitchen and grabbed a quick bite as I thought of nothing but leaving her there, all night long. And the next four hours, I wouldn't look at her any more.</p> <p>I was afraid that the thought of leaving had some of the same negative impact on me as it had on my Mom.</p> <p>Rachel wasn't coming home that night; that night she had gotten into some trouble with her boss for drinking, but the next day, she wasn't. Rachel had left her car at the mall early and left the keys on her desk to drive home to her Dad, who was in a funk.</p> <p>For all I knew, she had driven back to her apartment after a heavy drink and hadn't even made it back yet, even if she had had something in her hand.</p> <p>The next day I was home on Saturday and she had told me that if I wanted to go out, we would both go back and "do things."</p> <p>I had a headache that night and she was a bit too concerned about it to tell me what "things" were.</p> <p>But I had no choice in taking her to the park where we went to a nearby park where we both liked to sit on the swings and have a drink or two at the same time.</p> <p>I got quite a few looks from most of the people in the park, including some women and some men as she came to the swings.</p> <p>The first time was as I was standing at the swings looking up at Rachel, and then my mind went blank for a moment as I took in the sight of her wearing a cute pair of cut off jean shorts and a loose tank top, but in the summer, a loose shirt meant that, even in the cool night, she looked sexy.</p> <p>It was so cold out there in that day, and although a few people sat next to her, I could not see at what time or why she would put those shorts on - we were always in the shade.</p> <p>She was there, so I just looked at her. I had just gotten to the swings as I was watching the people on the swings as much as I was watching her.</p> <p>"Here, give me a hug," Rachel said as she wrapped her arms around me to hug me. "This is no surprise that my Dad has you over this afternoon."</p> <p>"I guess not," I said, knowing that Rachel was a very open person in public, especially since she never had anything to do with alcohol.</p> <p>I didn't think that she wanted me to go out with her; after all, my Mom and Dad used Rachel's car to drive home, and Rachel had been drinking that night.</p> <p>"I am so sorry about all my drinking the last few months," I said.</p> <p>"We won't be drinking very often for the next few weeks, remember!" she said.</p> <p>I knew of some people who would rather stay at home and watch television. We weren't, we weren't.</p> <p>"We didn't come out here for that," I admitted.</p> <p>"What's not to come out here for?" she asked.</p> <p>And then her hug ended as she wrapped her legs around me. I saw that her chest was heaving up and down as her face pressed into me, her body trembling in places she would never have imagined she could feel. She never did stop shaking. She hugged me even harder, and that seemed to make it difficult to breathe as my arms had found their way around her.</p> <p>"Let me go, I have to get up so I can go out to the park," she declared at last.</p> <p>I reluctantly let her loose, and stood there in a kind of daze as she stood on one foot as she walked.</p> <p>After she had left me there, I started to run away from her, trying to think of something that would make something go, especially to put me back in Rachel's good graces but then I felt the heat of her body against my back as I ran after her.</p> <p>It would seem that both of us were still standing there at that point, a little winded. But I couldn't shake the feeling that I had just walked away, and that was it.</p> <p>"Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
