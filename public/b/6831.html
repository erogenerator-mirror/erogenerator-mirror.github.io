"The one with the large breasts will do fine as well. Try to see what's happening."</p> <p>I was looking at the top of his chest. He was not going to let me see what was going on.</p> <p>"Look out," I said. "And don't touch my nipples; they get hard too fast, especially from being touched. Take off the jacket and the skirt." I reached out and squeezed his nipples, a finger and thumb rubbing against his pectoral muscle. He winced and then sighed.</p> <p>"Now," I said, "take off your clothes and lie on the bed. Face me to the ceiling. I want to watch for a while. Then I will make you orgasm with my breasts, you can't get it up all the time, but you can make some real progress for both of you if you do as I tell you."</p> <p>He lay down on the floor. His erection was showing now so I leaned over and took him in my mouth. He went hard when my lips touched him. When I looked up and saw him watching me make out with Michael I gave him another good suck and took him out.</p> <p>"Get back on the bed," I said, "stand up and let's get into position."</p> <p>I took his cock in my hand and led him back in front of the other bed. He got on the bed and lay back, the top edge on my mattress. I climbed up onto the bed and stood over him. He looked at me, his eyes wide with surprise, and his cock hard in my hand. I looked down at it as I knelt down at him, stroking his erection, squeezing the swollen shaft. As soon as I had him under me, his hand grasped the back of my head, a finger toying with my earlobe, and I kissed his cheek. He moaned then and his legs jerked and I leaned forward. His cock hit my nipple again, and he moaned again. He groaned and I put my full weight against him, my breast pressing gently against his chest. "Take this cock in your hand," I said, "and play with it."</p> <p>His hand was gentle with my hair as I brought his cock to my nipple, brushing back and forth over it, rubbing the head back and forth over my aching nipple. His other hand was on the other breast, fingers massaging and kneading it. His eyes were fixed on my face as I brought his cock to my nipple and lowered my mouth to feel the head against me. I felt it hard and hot against my nipple, as I licked it, feeling the heat of his cock. The head was so big, it seemed impossibly big in my small hand.</p> <p>It was difficult to work him in, but I used my lips and lips and tongue and my hands, working his cock and enjoying the sight of him in me. I kept my eyes locked on his cock, feeling the pressure under my hand and his cock twitching under my fingers. I let him rest a while as I brought his cock to my lips, opening my mouth, then taking the head in. I felt his stomach tighten.</p> <p>When I felt his hips move, moving his cock out of my mouth, I did the same, then reached my free hand down, grasping the base of his cock, stroking it in my hand. After a moment, I brought his balls up my nose and licked it. I heard him moan.</p> <p>"You've got beautiful lips, Mike," I said, my lips rubbing against his thighs. "Keep licking them, kiss them, lick my pussy. Use only your tongue on my pussy, I like it," I cooed, my hand stroking his shaft, "and then make me cum with your mouth when you're ready."</p> <p>I took her down on the bed, moving between his legs and taking his cock in my hand, guiding it between them. His head came up, and then back again, as I rubbed my wet hand up and down his shaft, stopping to play with his balls as he moaned. He moaned a little, his hips starting to move. I stopped, then looked at his face, seeing the strain on his eyes. His face was flushed with perspiration, his whole body quivering with passion.</p> <p>I knew he would make him cum with my lips and tongue, but I wanted to see him suffer. I needed another orgasm, just as the one from Michael had almost made him cum. I needed to make him experience as much pain and pleasure as I could. I wanted him to feel the pleasure of pain and pleasure. I needed him to give in, to have another orgasm while his body was going through all kinds of spasms.</p> <p>I got down on all fours and he got behind me, his cock entering and openingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
