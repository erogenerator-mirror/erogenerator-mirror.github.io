I shouldn't have asked, but I knew what I wanted." Her expression quickly changed to one of exasperation. "I'm so stupid, Jack. You know how it is for a man. I'm just sorry I took advantage of it. It's not anything I can do now."</p> <p>"Jack, you don't do this for yourself."</p> <p>"I don't know what you mean. I had no reason to do that. Please don't ask me this again." She moved towards the doorway. "I'll be home in a few. It's past 1. I don't want to see you anymore."</p> <p>I shook my head. "You're not leaving. I'll be around, too. Just... forget it ever happened." Then I left.</p> <p>Two days later, at 9.00pm I parked my car in my driveway. I was walking around, waiting for the phone. It rang at the bottom of my voice mail.</p> <p>'Yeah?' I answered.</p> <p>"Jack, you called. I hope you are okay. Listen... I wanted to tell you that the whole story was a bad one at first. But I know it will be a while before I can really talk to you straight. Can you make it a couple days? And I'll be able to talk again. Okay?"</p> <p>I was thinking out loud. "I'll get to it." There was a pause. "What do you want to do? I'm just gonna have my fun..."</p> <p>The silence of the day was punctuated with the sound of the phone. A man with a voice came on the conversation with what sounded like a bit of irritation in it. "Well, I'm not sure how I feel about you seeing a woman on a beach. If I would have a heart attack and die right there, you would probably be doing it, you know."</p> <p>"I know about people like that..." I heard a giggle in his voice. "I'm sure I have plenty of things to look forward to. So, when you said you would never do anything sexual ... and I've never asked you for sex, I'm not asking you for anything from you either."</p> <p>"That's not true." Silence. "Just like our relationship doesn't give us anything." Again, the silence.</p> <p>"You're not mad at me are you?'</p> <p>I hesitated. "No, we're not mad at you," I said through the receiver. "In fact we probably should have asked you for sex. You have to realize how much I'm going to enjoy having sex with you. If you wanted to, you could make it happen just by having sex with me. But if I didn't want to..."</p> <p>"It's okay if you want to," came the reply. "I understand. Just don't expect to be able to get together again anytime soon. I love you."</p> <p>When he hung up the phone a minute or two later, I looked at my watch. "There he is again! It would seem that my whole attitude about this had changed!"</p> <p>I sat back in my car and wondered if the change would happen, how long, when and where all the rest of it would have occurred. My head was spinning. I was going to do something, no more than that.</p> <p>The next day, about 9.30 am, my car pulled up. The driver in question, a black guy had a black Lexus, and my heart was racing. "I'm sorry. It has to be the police."</p> <p>My voice took on a higher tone. "So you got yourself a date with a woman who happens to have a body like a Playboy centerfold."</p> <p>'I'm not going to say no to one of those.'</p> <p>"Okay. So, tell me a few things."</p> <p>"No, nothing really. I'm just..." My voice trailed off as I looked at the clock on the dashboard. "I'll do this for the good of things," I said, then quickly added a bit of sarcasm, "if I get into trouble just a little bit. But you're going to leave now so I don't have the energy to go out and meet you."</p> <p>I could see the disappointment in his eyes. "I wouldn't feel bad if you go out with the wrong girl."</p> <p>"Really? Well, I'm not even going to say it. I just think I am an attractive woman." I smiled at the thought that my body would become a beautiful woman even if I hadn't found the woman I was looking for a day ago.</p> <p>The phone went dead and then a voice from outside the car said, "You can be sure I will never get in touch with you againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
