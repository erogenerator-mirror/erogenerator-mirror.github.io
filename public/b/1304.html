And that was what I felt for you, too."</p> <p>"A woman? I'm still a virgin."</p> <p>"Yes, but that felt like being your first."</p> <p>"That's great. But I'm afraid I'm still kind of a virgin myself."</p> <p>"Oh? I thought you were going to be a virgin when we met. Is that why you were so eager to be with a woman?" "That's because I'm a virgin too, you wouldn't be any better. I just didn't think you were."</p> <p>"But I wasn't."</p> <p>I reached out and took his hand. "Let me put it on your shoulder." I gently removed it.</p> <p>"I was afraid you would be more embarrassed if I showed you."</p> <p>"No, baby. I'm okay. I'm just a little shy, you know? I'm glad you are the type to show me that much."</p> <p>I pulled his coat off his shoulders and off in a flash, then my fingers gently grazed the skin of his back. I felt his shudder and groan and his skin felt soft and good. With one hand he slid the collar of his shirt slowly down until it rested loosely against his collar bone. "My shirt is not very comfortable for anything other than your shirt."</p> <p>He smiled coyly and pulled his head up. "You're not the first one to tell me that, iso."</p> <p>"And I'm the first one to do that to you."</p> <p>"I know that. That I would love to give you any pleasure."</p> <p>He sighed contentedly. "That would make the most sense, too."</p> <p>He leaned over to me and I put my arms around his waist and pulled him close. We kissed and I could feel his soft skin against mine. I felt warmth everywhere we touched. I reached up and drew his face close to mine and let the tip of my tongue touch his, briefly brushing over his lips, then tracing his chin, then resting the tip on the corner of his mouth. I continued kissing him as gently as I could manage. He held me closer and began to feel my breasts with both hands, running his fingers over my nipples with gentle fingers. I moaned into his mouth. I felt his erection press against the front of my skirt. "Is there more to see?" I asked as I pulled my shirt up to my shoulders and unhooked it, then ran my hands from the front of his shirt up his chest to his chin, running my hands over his collar bone and around his neck. His breath caught in his throat when my hand trailed back down to his front and began to unbuckle his belt. I undid and slid the belt through the hole at the front of his jeans, then my hand returned to the front of his jeans. I worked my hand down and back up his thighs, then stopped about halfway through the hole, and stopped.</p> <p>"No," I said firmly. "I'm not going to put the zipper down there. It's more fun for me to have the top half of my lover's cock exposed to me, to be touched for the first time. And not just for the first time, either."</p> <p>"That would be nice, sweetheart."</p> <p>I nodded and pulled my hand away from his cock and began undoing the zipper of his jeans. I was rewarded with a brief moment later with his cock pushing through his fly and up against the back of my hand. I moved the zipper down gently, then slipped both hands back to the front of his underwear and began to pull gently on them. I couldn't believe how big his cock felt. It was easily eight inches long, but I guess it must have been bigger. I began to feel the coolness of his skin as I rolled his underwear down his thighs, then slipped them off his feet. He was already breathing hard as I let the underwear drop to his ankles. "Is it getting bigger?" I asked as I reached between his legs and ran my finger up the length of his cock.</p> <p>"Mmm, I think it's going to be bigger than you are right now!"</p> <p>I laughed. "I'm a virgin, now. I think I'm too old to have the biggest thing in the world!"</p> <p>"It has to be bigger!"</p> <p>I felt the head of his cock pressing against my hand, then realized I had not taken any of it into my mouth to suck on it. I shook my head. "I don't like to be the only one to get a taste."</p> <p>"It may be a little too long, though," he chuckled, then slid his hands into my hair and gently pulled me toward him.
