He didn't even know how or if this happened but she had been aching to know the pain in his hands as he moved them.</p> <p>As she heard the phone ringing her attention snapped back to the task at hand.</p> <p>*</p> <p>"You didn't bring that up."</p> <p>"Yeah it was fine. You asked if I wanted to go to the beach. I just thought you wanted a private moment."</p> <p>"And you were sure?"</p> <p>"Yep."</p> <p>"Thank god."</p> <p>"I was hoping you got that."</p> <p>"Oh, and when we walked in the door I was thinking about what just happened. That's when I realized I was very guilty."</p> <p>"Don't worry about it. Let's not push things, I just want this to be okay. We both knew that was going to have to be quick." He put his hand on her shoulder and turned her away.</p> <p>"Is that what you're saying? You want to have sex with me that badly?"</p> <p>"If you were here I would have gotten down on my knees and kissed you." He squeezed her shoulder.</p> <p>"You had no right to talk to me like that. I can't be mad at you for that."</p> <p>He got up and walked over to his desk and picked up a business card and a pen.</p> <p>"Here's my home phone number. Just call me if you want to go to the beach."</p> <p>"You got it. And just to remind you I'll call you."</p> <p>"What's he like?"</p> <p>"Just some nice guy and some woman. They're all friendly and he loves watching them sun, so enjoy yourselves."</p> <p>When his car pulled up to her house he was silent and the thought of sex was a part of the fantasy. He had no idea how he was going to get her to come around. It was always going to be difficult to talk about it but he could not refuse the invitation and he doubted she would have sex with him if he had the courage to ask.</p> <p>She arrived early and the two drove the short distance to the beach on their first day in the city. They were both quiet as they drove through the sun and a small part of her that she hadn't really appreciated growing up took them in turns. She loved seeing his body even though he was probably only five years her senior and she wanted to tease him with a memory that would make her feel good.</p> <p>She pulled the car out of a small cul-de-sac called 'Fruit Street' where they had always made their way through the pines. They walked along the beach hand-in-hand and as he pointed out the landmarks they remembered in their time together.</p> <p>"You know there's always a first for everything."</p> <p>"Maybe, but that's where you're at? You're the one who had to get up on your toes and fall into the sand and not crawl for the first time this summer." He turned her to him and wrapped his arms around his neck as he pulled her up against him pressing his lips to hers and feeling his tongue probing inside her mouth. Their lips parted and he let out a groan of frustration when he took his hands away and stood back up.</p> <p>"Do you want to do something?" He asked with a tone of disbelief.</p> <p>"Oh hell no! That was all I needed." She smiled and pulled off his shorts, releasing his cock. "I want to do everything with you from first hand experience. I'm all yours for as many days as I can stand it."</p> <p>He stepped back toward the car. When he got in the driver's side she took his hand and put it to her pussy. She didn't need any help. She came in two minutes and began to slowly masturbate. She pulled her top half over her breasts and pushed the top down exposing them to his lips. She was already wet enough to easily slid his cock inside. She felt tight from the excitement of not knowing how much pleasure a penis could take, only a few millimeters of his head went in with each stroke. The feeling of his cock in her had her coming almost immediately.</p> <p>Her breathing was fast as she pulled him close to her and began to slide his fingers over her clit and down her legs. When his thumb moved over the nub she knew she couldn't take any more and began to move faster and faster.</p> <p>"Oh, Oh, I'm coming!" She bit her lower lip as her orgasm began. She kept sliding his cock deep inside her until she felt it pulsing and then she pulled away and reached for him. She guided him on her into her and moved him so she was able to get him entirely in. She felt like she could hold on for the rest of the journey. He was as hard as he had ever beenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
