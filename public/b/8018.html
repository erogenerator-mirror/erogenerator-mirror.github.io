What I saw was beyond beautiful. It was a girl. There were no blemishes either; only small crayfish heads - or little crinkly teeth. She had long silky hair down the middle of her back and a long shapely tail between her legs, and she was just wearing a pair of black leather boots. She looked beautiful; all eyes and mouth, and her eyes were dark and deep dark eyes. Her mouth was small; as if she had never had much makeup. They seemed to glide over every inch of her face as she descended on the bed.</p> <p>She straddled the bed, and laid her cheek down on the bed. She started to rub her hands over her body...her eyes closed and her head tilted upward. Her tail wiggled between her legs, and from that angle I could see her pretty pink nub. All I could think of was that she was very special, and this made me feel incredibly hard. I saw her nipples harden and her eyes begin to widen. I saw a few drops of blood start to form on them - no blood any longer - they were now growing long dark hair that was reaching down to her elbows. She rubbed her tail over her torso as she ran her hands over her chest and arms, making those t-shirt t-shirts look like something made for sports. Every time she got closer the little hairs grew thicker and darker. Finally she laid her head on the bed.</p> <p>"How does it feel?" she asked. "Getting that hard cock up me? Is that all for me?"</p> <p>I just smiled at her. "That's what it is. And I can tell you that I'm very proud. I'm a very lucky guy. The way you are looking at me with these eyes makes it even more special because I'm so happy to be your slave." I could feel myself growing hard again - in spite of all the excitement of the situation.</p> <p>Then I told her to lie on her back. She obeyed. I got out her toys. There was a black leather strap-on, and on the end of that was a very thick 8 inch cock with balls. It glistened as it was held up by a silver ring that held it to her body. There was a big red ring at the head that went from her left nipple to her navel. It matched her leather boots perfectly. In the middle of the strap was a leather strap attached to her neck, which made the leather strap appear all the more intense.</p> <p>While I was at work with the toys, I'd got back to thinking about my new slave and the excitement my new slave was feeling. Was I wrong to think of her in that way? If it meant that she looked so desirable that I was unable to leave her alone after all, then well, that must mean that there was a way to release me from all these feelings of jealousy and anger that I kept seeing in girls my age or even older and in that area of my life and especially in my fantasies. I tried that. I tried to think all the things that I saw in pictures. If you were to see the girl in those photos, the way she seemed to fit into your fantasy, then you'd see the man who just loved to use as a slave. I don't think it would be that way. If it worked for you the way I would, I'd love to see you with him too. It was just that, just that, there were times when I wished that there was a way for me to release all these thoughts and emotions that I was feeling about my new slave. I also remembered the time in that room with this young girl. She and I always were very close, I told myself. I didn't mean to be such a big jerk about it, I just thought that it was very appropriate to put her into her new situation and try to keep her happy. This was my new, much needed friend and I could tell that the happiness I would be experiencing in that place was growing inside him too.</p> <p>"Do you want to go on?" my slave asked. "I think you do."</p> <p>"Why don't you lie down here with me, get comfortable and I'll be right with you."</p> <p>"OK," she said. I got onto the bed. I kissed her gently at first, but then I pulled back after a couple of minutes.</p> <p>"Lie down," she told me again. I lay down on my stomach, just out of reach of the strap-on. She went and got a lubricant out of her bag. I felt her hands working the lube onto my chest. Then she knelt on the side of the bed and straddled my hips like she had before.
