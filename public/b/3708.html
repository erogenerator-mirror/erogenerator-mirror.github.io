As I tried to control my words, my body jerked uncontrollably. "Oh yes. Ah, ah, ah, ah..." I was moaning my orgasm as his finger continued to move from my anus to my wet pussy but I didn't feel his hot tongue at all as his mouth clamped firmly over my pussy. I was panting, almost frantic as the ecstasy in my core grew.</p> <p>My orgasm began a tingling sensation in my pussy and I pressed down hard on his finger. "Oh, Ahhhhh. Ahhhhh. Yes, yes, yes!" I continued to press down until my hips shook and my thighs quaked. It was such a delicious experience.</p> <p>We were panting as we slowly recovered from the incredible experience and when we were finally back upright, breathing hard, I kissed him gently once again. "Did...did you enjoy that?" I asked, surprised.</p> <p>"Oh, yes." He said, smiling. "And, I think we...we're going to do a number on you."</p> <p>Oh, my. Did I just hear him correctly? He was referring to the fact that I am bisexual and I don't have a problem with that. But is that what had just happened? Was this my first lesbian experience? Or was it as much a result of the night before as I had been experiencing? I couldn't tell.</p> <p>"Oh, wow!" I said with a grin as I turned to him and said, "I think I'm going to have fun with this."</p> <p>"So you do, did you?" he said, grinning broadly. His right hand had found me clamped between myself and the table but not where I had pressed it on the edge of the table. My legs were open and I still had his finger pressed inside me.</p> <p>"Of course, I enjoyed it," I said, my hand now sliding up to my breast. "I don't have to do it anymore. I mean we've been through, so don't you think it's time you quit complaining?"</p> <p>"I...I'm sorry" he said, clearly surprised.</p> <p>"No, no, not at all", was my reply. "No, no, really, it's all right. You and I have had sex more before and it's good to see you happy. Besides, we haven't done it more than once or twice. I want us to go on that trip again if you'll let me. You can come with me if you want when we are here."</p> <p>"Okay" he said, sounding relieved. "I'll do that as long as we don't have to go to Vegas the next day."</p> <p>The waiter arrived with our meal and we ordered desert and we went back to my room shortly afterwards. It had the added benefit that our sexual connection, even if it was mutual, had been expanded beyond just the two of us. I was looking at my lover as I lay down in my bed. He was looking at me as well. One leg was up on the bed and he had a leg bent at the knee. He was caressing my breast as he kissed me on the forehead.</p> <p>"You are so beautiful, Sabrina." I could feel his hand on my breast. "So beautiful."</p> <p>"Yes. You aren't the only one, Mr. Thomas. I've seen your cock a thousand times." I reached out and stroked his cock. "Do you like to fuck? Or do you prefer to go wherever you want. Either way you can come with me anytime now. Let me make love to you and make you forget that we can't do it again."</p> <p>I was lying on the bed, smiling and thinking about what he had just done to me. I wondered if he remembered that I had asked him to do it and that he was already on his way. I didn't think he had. Well, I had, I could certainly guess.</p> <p>"Yes, fuck me! Take me with you!" I said, reaching for him.</p> <p>He had been standing and holding my hands. His hand wrapped in mine as his mouth took mine. We kissed passionately. He caressed me all over and I caressed him. It felt very erotic to have such an erotic moment with someone else.</p> <p>It had taken a lot of persuasion and convincing and when our lips finally made a last lingering kiss, we were lying side by side on the bed. Our legs were apart, our fingers caressing each other's thighs and shoulders, our faces near close but our eyes so far apart.</p> <p>It was a completely different being here. The intimacy of our first meeting was intense and we were both feeling it. And the feel of our bodies close together was just intoxicating. I leaned over and our lips met but we were not at the other person orâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
