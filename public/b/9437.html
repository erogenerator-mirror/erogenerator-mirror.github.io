It doesn't mean to say that I didn't enjoy myself immensely. No, I did, and I sure do mean that to you.</p> <p>Well let's just say that I was hoping that you would let me reciprocate. I didn't though, as I always liked to give the lady a little something.</p> <p>Now I realize that I should have said something before. I should not have left you hanging after telling you what I'd done for you, and that you've only told me about everything I've done. This is what I've told you, not any of it in the story, just everything I've told you will make it happen, and I'll tell you the truth in just a minute, if you understand.</p> <p>Oh by the way, I like doing this. It seems so strange and naughty and hot and beautiful. I'm really starting to like you now, I don't want to stop again. Let's just say that that I'm having such a great time at home again, I don't want to stop now, just keep loving me and making up for myself. Let's just keep on seeing this as our special moment, and maybe, just maybe, find out if there's anything that we're missing in our lives.</p> <p>Let's just enjoy this, and maybe, we'll do it again, as often as we both can manage itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
