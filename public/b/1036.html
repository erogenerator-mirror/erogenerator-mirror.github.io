I can't stand all this tension. I promise I won't be able to control myself at home," I promised.</p> <p>"I want you to. The way I feel about you. I want to do something to make you happy. But, I won't do that if I can't have you, either." she told me as she ran her hands down my side.</p> <p>"What do you say I kiss you? I want to do that, too." I told her before I got my lips on hers.</p> <p>She tasted like strawberries and as our lips pressed our tongues met to dance together once again. It was so strange, she was much more than my usual shy partner or ex. And somehow sexy and I wanted more. "Okay." she told me. She ran her hands down my sides and around my ass, lifting my shirt from my pants. My cock began to harden. "I have a special place in my pocket where I bought this." she said as she slid her hand under my boxers and wrapped her fingers around my hardened shaft. Her lips and tongue felt so good as I slid my hand inside her bikini bottoms and touched her clit.</p> <p>"Your turn, big boy!" she purred. As she slipped on her panties, she turned to face me and kissed me again, sucking my tongue as the tip of mine parted her lips. She slid the straps on her bra down, exposing her beautiful breasts for me. As she was pulling her panties off, she turned back toward me and dropped to her knees. I moved in and kissed her again. Our tongues danced together as I slowly unclasped her swim trunks and tossed them aside. The contrast between her white bikini and her dark tanned skin made my stomach tingle and my cock twitch. She didn't have much to remove except her legs and a string tied around her waist.</p> <p>"Mmmm. This feels so good." she told me as she reached up to play with my nipples.</p> <p>"I can hardly wait. You are so sexy!" as she ran her fingers through my pubic hair. "Are you ready for the next step?"</p> <p>As I stood before her, my cock standing straight up, she grabbed my cock and guided it to her hungry little mouth. I took the lead of the little dance and slid it between her lips on her tongue. Our bodies were pressed together as we kissed deeply, each of us enjoying every little bit of contact we were now sharing. I slowly began to press forward until the tip of my cock pressed over her lower lips. We broke our kiss to look into each other's eyes. She smiled sweetly. I leaned forward again to push my cock into her mouth. She immediately opened as wide as she could, taking it between her lips, pulling me in until it nearly bumped her throat. As she sucked, she moaned and her eyes closed. I could feel my balls begin to tighten, ready to orgasm. I held my balls as the tip of my cock pushed into her mouth, sliding against the roof of her throat. I held it there until she began to giggle. I pushed it all the way in again, then withdrew and then slid it back out. It felt so good as her lips slid up and down my shaft. There were no more teasing kisses. We fucked for hours. As she sucked my cock I felt her fingers rub my balls again, and then I was cumming once again. Once again, when my cum was spent, I could feel her warm mouth enclosing my cock as she swallowed it.</p> <p>We continued to stare at each other until my breath, almost back to normal. Finally, the embrace seemed to subside as it always did. "That was amazing and, wow!" she told me.</p> <p>"It was, wasn't it?" I told her, kissing her again. "I hope I can get you to wear this every afternoon."</p> <p>Her smile grew wider. "I'm sure you can," she said as she ran her fingers through my hair and kissed me again.
