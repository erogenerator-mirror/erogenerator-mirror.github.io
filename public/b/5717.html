"Fuck yeah."</p> <p>"Are you getting yourself off?" she asked, almost lovingly.</p> <p>"Yeah, I don't think I'm going to last very long," I assured her. She didn't seem to mind.</p> <p>"God, your ass would feel amazing right up inside of your pussy," she teased.</p> <p>I couldn't possibly last long without having an orgasm like that.</p> <p>She kept her lips over my ear as she continued to tease my balls, but moved her hand from the couch back down to my cock. Her warm hand was so light that it felt amazing.</p> <p>"God, you're so hard." Her breath was almost hot against my cheek. "Cum for me," she whispered, and with that, she wrapped her lips and her fingers around me as she stroked me.</p> <p>My eyes widened. "I'm gonna fill your mouth." My first release came quickly and powerfully, and she moaned with me in response.</p> <p>She removed her hand from where she was stroking and I felt like she was rubbing my cock directly, with her entire hand, while her lips were moving up and down.</p> <p>"Gonna explode," I warned, almost breathless.</p> <p>"No. Don't," she warned back.</p> <p>"Shoot it," I gasped, as the first spurt of ropey cum launched into the air and splashed against her cheek.</p> <p>She jerked her head up and looked like she had been shocked, as if she was surprised.</p> <p>I watched the head of my dick jolt against her cheek as the last of our cum landed on her face.</p> <p>She closed her lips tightly over me and swallowed my load before returning her lips to me. It didn't take long. It looked like she was taking another mouthful of cum for herself, only this time, instead of me, it was her.</p> <p>She was looking at me the entire time with our cum-covered faces and she kept stroking me. I looked at each of her cheeks, noticing the small puffy cum-lines that she was leaving behind as she stroked me.</p> <p>"Whew," I exhaled.</p> <p>She smiled around the mouthful of cum that was in her mouth, then kissed me again. A few drops of cum fell from the corner of her mouth into mine, so I lifted my lips and licked her cheek clean.</p> <p>"That was amazing," I told her. "Just incredible. I didn't know what you were thinking."</p> <p>She tilted her head to one side and grinned at me. "I was thinking of nothing but you."</p> <p>"Yeah? Well, that's sweet."</p> <p>"And I've got nothing on you," she whispered. "You haven't cum yet."</p> <p>"No, I haven't," I replied. "Only... I mean, I didn't want to mess up your makeup. I want to go home."</p> <p>"That's okay," she smiled.</p> <p>At that point, I didn't really care if I was home. Her eyes were locked on mine the entire time, taking in everything I was giving her.</p> <p>We broke our kisses and she reached between us to rub my cock through my pants while we kissed.</p> <p>"I guess I don't have any more makeup left," she admitted.</p> <p>"No, you don't," I answered for her. "We can leave that up to each other."</p> <p>"And what will I do?" she mused.</p> <p>"I'd do anything you want," I quickly replied.</p> <p>She smiled. "Anything."</p> <p>I grabbed a pair of black heels out of my bag and threw them into the bedroom and we walked out of the bathroom into the bedroom, still naked. I couldn't believe this was going to happen... and right next to us, her legs were wrapped around me and her boobs were pressed right up against my chest.</p> <p>"Your clothes," she said, and I couldn't help but smile.</p> <p>There was barely any room between us so I had to slide her dress down to her waist. She was wearing a sheer, black lace bra, which left her breasts bare. I immediately reached around her and began to feel her bare back, down to her ass. I loved the smoothness of her skin, and I couldn't believe that this was happening, even with the lights on.</p> <p>My hands ran over her bare skin, up and around to her breasts and down to her waist. My fingers hooked at the bottom of her bra as I cupped her round, young ass.
