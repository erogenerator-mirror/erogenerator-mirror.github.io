Her pussy was soaking and I could see she was more than ready to come for me.</p> <p>She quickly pulled my hair and started grinding herself onto my fingers; pushing them into her pussy and sliding them up into her dripping pussy. I could feel her cum running down my finger as she came. My own pussy was so hot as I felt the warmth of a hot, wet pussy wrap around my fingers. I started to finger fuck her to finish her off. The more she came, the hotter she got as I fucked her to finish us off, she was so desperate to be fucked. She ground her hips as hard as she could against my hand and I knew she was going to cum again as I slipped another finger inside her.</p> <p>"Oh fuck, oh fuck" she groaned as the second finger went in deeper; "Fuck I'm...CUM!" then she pushed herself against me as hard as she could; "More, more harder I'm going...OH! I'm...ohhhhh yeeeaaaaaaa!!!!!"</p> <p>I knew she was cumming and I finger fucked her and she was so close. Almost immediately she pressed her pussy hard against my fingers and I could tell she was trying to get out of it. She was thrashing about on my hand as she screamed with pleasure. I took it as a sign that she was going to be able to take another orgasm as I slid a third finger inside her. My own orgasm was building and I wanted more of her as she pulled my face against her pussy as well as she felt me fingering another woman just an hour or so ago.</p> <p>Her pussy began to spasm as she orgasmed and her pussy just spasmed against me as she came and came. I started to move my fingers in and out of her as she started to rub her clit.</p> <p>"Oh my god," She groaned as she finally came, "Yeah, keep fucking me. It feels so good." She continued to rub herself against my face but was at a loss. As her orgasm subsided I moved from between her legs, her pussy juice still dripping out my hand as I slid my lips off her and kissed her pussy while she was still spasming.</p> <p>"How did you know I like that?" she asked, "You were right about just about anything" and she lay back with her eyes closed. She opened one eye to look at the night stands as my fingers moved in and out of her. I had not removed my hand and it was glistening with her and her wetness as I moved my head to look at her pussy. The head looked so dark, her hair was a little disheveled as her face was red in the face of what was obviously pleasure but definitely didn't seem to be pain as her whole body shuddered with each orgasm.</p> <p>"It feels good," I said as I crawled forward to her again and kissed her for a few minutes. She moaned as I touched her and held my lips around hers. We kissed for a while and kissed a little longer before she opened her eyes and smiled at me.</p> <p>"Well I hope you two lovebirds enjoyed our show," she said as she pushed herself off the sofa and ran to the bathroom.</p> <p>"The show is over, maybe we can get back to it again?" I said as I got up and headed to the bathroom.</p> <p>"Well, if you two will just excuse me, I think I'll make the rest of my night at home." She said as she started the shower and was soon wrapped in a towel as we finished cleaning ourselves up.</p> <p>"I'll see you in a little while," I said as I walked her back to the room.</p> <p>"See you later," she said as she opened the door and walked away. We both smiled at that, we just wanted a little more time to clean up. I left the bathroom and went back to the lounge chair in which we played with the controls of the toy. I was hoping to get that little bit of action again but it looked so different now. There was more going on but not with the toy being played with. I decided I needed to sit down and take stock of myself. I wondered if there was a reason that the toy wasn't turned on anymore but decided that there was no way that I had my pussy so turned on as it was.</p> <p>I looked at the controls and then started to type in the number of orgasms a little bit. I found out what the vibrator was doing and I could feel that it was doing that on a different level than the cock. It must have been working on her pussy too. I could not tell if it was vibrating it on her clit or what but I did not care. It felt good to feel what it did andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
