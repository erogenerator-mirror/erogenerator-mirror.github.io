Do it. Do it for me."</p> <p>She looked into his eyes and then smiled. A smile that seemed to shine in her eyes, even just through a lens that could not be removed. He felt his chest rising and falling as he listened to her words echo around the car. Just as it was starting to get to him. He closed and opened his mouth to speak. "But I can't," he stammered but didn't change course.</p> <p>"Climb in on the passenger seat and we can get that off. We have a few hours and you can take turns as you drive. If you are a bit shy I will give you some privacy."</p> <p>He felt himself go red. She had said 'let's get it off'. This was something he couldn't believe he was doing. He glanced at the clock. It was 7:00 a.m. He had only just pulled into the driveway when she pulled her blouse over her head and tossed it to the passenger seat. He looked up and saw her looking down at herself in her high heels at him. The blouse followed her skirt and left her topless, standing in the front of his car. She smiled even more when he saw that her legs weren't as shapely as he had first suspected.</p> <p>He got out of the car just as he was about to say something and she called out:</p> <p>"There's our parking in the garage out back"</p> <p>He followed her from the car and as he did so she told him "Good. Keep going."</p> <p>When he got to the front of the car, there was a sliding glass door and she closed the door after closing it. Then he saw the light switch and there was no door to separate parking places. His heart lurched in his chest and he felt himself get wet just looking at her again. He looked around and saw an empty parking space at his rear entrance where he was supposed to park. He looked at the side of the car and saw a light, which seemed to shine directly on him. It wasn't a light; it was a street light. Suddenly he realized what she intended him to do. He hesitated. "I.. I don't know." It had to be something. "Oh God that's a real nice car" he thought.</p> <p>He started to take off his shoes and then he stopped suddenly, realizing his actions were too bold. He was going to strip naked and that might be as good a start as any, but then that was not what she wanted from him. She opened the door so fast and it closed again but there was no door in the front of the car. He heard her fumbling about inside the car and then he heard her voice again.</p> <p>"That's better. I like to watch you undress." "No touching at all." "Do it" she ordered and he felt his penis rising from his body as he reached down and took his shoes off. He stood there at the front of the car, completely naked, looking down at himself and her.</p> <p>She reached up and touched his shoulder, running her fingers through his hair.</p> <p>"There are no secrets there now, we are even."</p> <p>She turned him and leaned forward so that his back hit the glass.</p> <p>"You didn't think I was doing this, did you?"</p> <p>He nodded a yes.</p> <p>"Would you like me to do this for you?"</p> <p>"More than anything in the world."</p> <p>He closed his eyes, feeling his heart skip beats and his penis rise. She ran her fingertips lightly up his arms and down his back and over his buttocks. He opened his eyes again and looked at her. She touched him in between his buttocks and then she began to run her fingers in a circle around his anus. He leaned forward and his face was close to hers. She took his lips softly and he leaned forward, kissing her there and then taking his tongue and drawing it into her mouth. He felt his penis hardening as she continued to move her fingers in circles around it. He felt himself begin to pant and his member twitched.</p> <p>"Come here."</p> <p>He stood up suddenly and she reached out and took it in one hand.</p> <p>"Sit down. I want you to relax and let me look at you. Do you want me to do to your body what I was just doing?"</p> <p>He sat down and began to take his shoes off, but she stood up and then sat down again in the seat. She began to stroke his back again until he was lying down and he saw her begin to run her fingers up and down his legs, running her fingers along the inside of his thighs. With her hands, her movements were slow and purposeful. He felt his penis begin to grow and he had no doubt that this was what she wanted from himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
