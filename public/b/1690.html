I smirked and looked at her as she looked me incredulously. I wasn't going for a long-term fuck though.</p> <p>"I don't think I quite got this through to you, Jack. That is one thing a guy is supposed to understand. You don't have a choice. I don't." She didn't even attempt to say anything. I decided to give her a break from being an object of my lust.</p> <p>"Are you going to put my hand in your panties, to feel the wetness there?" I said it slowly but firmly. "Then use your free hand, as you were doing earlier, and rub that wetness up. Make sure to hold it and pull on it very gently. If you feel any pain just say so right away." She looked at me questioningly. I didn't expect anything but I had more in mind. So I took a deep breath and reached under my sweater, my hands lifting the lacy bra for her. She looked at it confused momentarily, but then her hands began to gently rub, almost absently. I moved my hands to cup her breasts once again.</p> <p>"I said do you like to rub your breasts?" I said as my eyes were focused right on her hand that was softly rubbing herself. She was lost to whatever she was doing.</p> <p>"Yes, it does feel nice doesn't it, Jack?" she said her voice breaking a little. I lifted the bra off her and placed my hands on her breasts with a little tug.</p> <p>"Oh," I breathed.</p> <p>"I know how it feels, Jack." It was the word. That word I was trying to remember. "Do you usually have a cock?" I asked her. She nodded slowly.</p> <p>"Jack? Have you ever fucked?" I smiled at her embarrassment. It had been a while since I had fucked her.</p> <p>"I don't think I can say," she said.</p> <p>"Do think about it, baby. I won't press any further. If you ever do it with you boyfriend or anything else, just take it and leave it alone, ok? I will never ask again to do something like it, ok?" she reached up and squeezed her breasts for me. I didn't care about her answer about anything other than her desire and the need I felt to please her sexually.</p> <p>"Ok, Jack? Can we fuck now?" she said.</p> <p>"If you want, we can. I think we could go down to the park now, and you can sit on the grass so you can rub your breasts again," I said, looking at her for reassurance. She nodded, as my hands slid back lower.</p> <p>"It would feel better like this, on your back, Jack. Lie down on you back, on the grass." She didn't argue. She was still a bit tentative as my hands slid down and back up, her eyes still locked on the action before her. I slid up very slowly and then slid down again, my body now leaning over her and resting against her. That's where I started, just a little further, on the grass, and that was when I pulled my hands away. She immediately took two hands and started to roll the blanket down so she could sit with me when it became uncomfortable, too.</p> <p>"I think I should start by letting you know what I think. I know, Jack, I know that you think that you haven't made love to anyone since my dad passed away, but I think you're in need of some new experiences." She was starting to understand now. I saw it in her eyes as well. "I will be a good boy, Jack. I won't tell you until after we go to bed, but I feel the world has never stopped going by. You could never find yourself doing something like this. I think you do too, to know that. Just keep yourself in line with the things that happen in your life and you will be doing it for as long as you can." She nodded in understanding. She had never felt a cock penetrate her. I smiled.</p> <p>She began to lie on her back, not so much looking, but just sitting. When her hips moved back into a more comfortable position I raised my hand and brought it down hard on the flat side of her thigh. The impact made a little noise, a noise but the whole lot of that was already coming from somewhere else. She looked at it and back at me for a moment. I was still in control of the situation, if someone had come upon us in the parking lot.</p> <p>Her eyes were wide with shock, her mouth opened slightly. Her hand moved slowly up her inner thigh, just touching her pubic hair and down again.
