Well, thank you."</p> <p>He smiled shyly and we both got up. I watched as he made his way upstairs. When he reached his bedroom I followed him and he stopped. He looked at me with a slightly sad expression.</p> <p>"I guess it's time to get ready. I'm going to change and get myself ready to go out. I think I'm going to hit the town to get some clothes in and just go."</p> <p>He sighed and got a suitcase and set it on the bed. He looked out the bathroom mirror and smiled as he opened the door and walked out of sight. I stared after him, not really sure what to do. Why did he want to know? Who was he to be disappointed that I hadn't gone out. He got in the shower and I followed and found him to be a perfect picture. He got out and went into the bathroom to get dressed. When he returned he was dressed and he looked as if he had done a runner for a run. I was about to leave when he looked down at himself and then at me as he reached toward his mouth. Suddenly, I felt very awkward. "You sure look like a man with that face. You need some makeup, too."</p> <p>He turned to look at me, "I hope you didn't mind. I'm already a little dirty."</p> <p>I blushed at his words and I saw his eyes move from my face to my eyes and I looked away. I felt a little ashamed that I didn't get dressed quickly, or at least that I didn't have much time. We both got out of the shower while I finished putting my makeup. He came back out to get dressed and I sat by the side of the bed.</p> <p>"So, have you had your fun with Ms. B. yet? Do you think she enjoyed the video."</p> <p>He hesitated for a second before he continued, "She's been nice. She really turned me on. Why don't you come over today and tell me all about it?"</p> <p>I couldn't believe that I would actually have to tell him about all of it. Maybe it was good for him to show me and maybe we might really have a chance again. I started to tell him everything that happened in there, just to let him know that maybe he made the right decision. As soon as I finished telling him about his video, I got up, dressed and made up my mind. I didn't want to end up being the biggest hypocrite in the world. When I walked out of the bedroom he was still standing there watching me. I had changed back into my normal clothes, but it was dark in the room. I put on a black pencil skirt and a tight black top with no bra. I had been showing off my body since I was in my 10th year of school and all this time, I had really felt guilty about getting all I had done wrong.</p> <p>"I really don't know what to say. You really were so mean to my date this weekend. I guess I felt like I was a real whore."</p> <p>"It's ok, Ms. B. You were always nice to me. You showed me everything that happened in the video you had on your screen."</p> <p>I could feel the heat on my face and as soon as I felt it, I felt like all of the air had been knocked out of my body. I really liked him and I really wanted to give that to him.</p> <p>"It's ok, Scott. I understand. I would never do anything against your authority and I really respect you. I'll see you back in class today."</p> <p>After that I walked out the door and I was almost ready to walk out there in a different setting. I really felt like this was going to be my last time alone. It took me over a half hour to get to my car and I spent the next 2 hour in my car wondering if I should have told him. I finally arrived at my class and it was empty. It would be another 3 hours before that. I sat down across from my professor and then I just sat there. I had no idea if there would even be any discussion over what happened in the video.</p> <p>"Have you spoken with Ms. B again since Friday afternoon?"</p> <p>I looked over, "Yes."</p> <p>"Do you still feel embarrassed about it?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Do you still go through the weekend thinking about it?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Well, have you thought about Ms. B?"</p> <p>I finally could feel myself get angry at him and I shook my head. "No."</p> <p>"Yes?"</p> <p>"Have you considered that we can be more than just friends againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
