We spent the better part of the next two weeks making love again and, by the end of it, was more than one night of wild animal sex! We kissed and cuddled and I tasted the faintest hint of her nectar mixed with my pre-pubescent excitement.</p> <p>We made the most of this evening. We had dinner and went to watch a movie. We ended up in bed together with a good fucking that went on for quite some time.</p> <p>Her pussy still felt tender and swollen. I could still feel her lips swollen from the last copulation. Even though my cock remained hard, it was still not erect as it used to be. I was amazed that she still could still keep her pussy hard and still respond to our passion. I kissed her gently on her face, neck and collarbone, and moved a couple of fingers down over her breasts, pinching her nipples gently but firmly, making her squirm against my mouth. It worked! I moved my other hand up from where it had rested on her pussy and moved it over her clit to her lips so that they were spread and ready. I teased her with two fingers and moved them back and forth over her sensitive clit. I could feel it starting to swell. I rubbed it back and forth across the hood.</p> <p>Then I moved one finger across the top of her clit. She started to stiffen against the pressure. "Please, don't stop," she said.</p> <p>So, I began moving my finger back and forth in circles, feeling it grow. I could feel her hips rise against me. I was almost there and just when I got near the end, I stopped and asked her to wait. I moved up onto my elbows and watched as her hips started moving up and down in earnest. The look on her face was like a cat as she closed her eyes, savoring the moment, while I moved up and started rubbing her clit again.</p> <p>"Oh, Tom! I'm comme...!"</p> <p>"Do you like it, Jan"?</p> <p>I knew she did.</p> <p>"It's wonderful! It's never been like this before."</p> <p>"You don't need to wait, Jan."</p> <p>She didn't protest when I stopped. She just turned her head in my direction and kissed me. "Yes I do."</p> <p>My cock was hard again. As she turned, she looked over her shoulder and smiled, then said, "If you fuck me good, I think we'll get lucky tonight." She kissed me again, then moved down until my cock was buried in her, and said again, "But I've got a surprise in store for youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
