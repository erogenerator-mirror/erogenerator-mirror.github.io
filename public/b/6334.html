You can do it, really well.’</p> <p>‘Don’t move, I’m not going in there.’</p> <p>She got one of the vibrators and slowly inserted it, inserting it until the head, then the shaft, then up to the head, back and forth. ‘Oh, yes!’ I said. ‘My cock feels so good.’</p> <p>‘You can fuck it, now, sir.’ She said, getting it into her hand. Then she reached over and handed me a tube from the bathroom.</p> <p>‘I’ll grease your ass, then.’</p> <p>She handed me a tube, then turned around. ‘Put some lube on this.’ She handed it to me, then got behind me. ‘Now, go ahead, and finger it. That’s a good one for penetration, anyway.’</p> <p>She placed her hands on my shoulder, as she worked the lube in. Then she moved her hips back and began to push the vibrator in and out of my anus. ‘Yes,’ I whispered. She started moving it faster in and out, her breath coming in short fast gasps. ‘I am soooo wet, sir.’ I thought she was going to pull out or roll me over, but instead she slipped the vibe back into my ass. She got a little more speed and intensity, but not at all fast. Instead, she held it steady in my anus, and I felt her body slide behind me. ‘God, I am soooo wet.’ She slowly, very slowly began to push the vibe in and out of my ass, getting it in deeper.</p> <p>‘Does that feel good, sir?’ I answered.</p> <p>‘Yes.’ she whispered. “Fuck me.”</p> <p>I leaned back, and she positioned herself behind me. “Put all of you into me, sir—all of you.” I moved her hands off my neck while she pushed the vibe in and out of me, going faster.</p> <p>"Go on, honey. Fuck me.” It felt so good. “Do it, honey.”</p> <p>“Uh—okay.” I said.</p> <p>I moved the vibe as she had, and it felt incredible. “Oh, god, yes, it feels so good.” I pushed my ass back at her, wanting the vibe moving in and out of my anus. “Faster, honey, do it harder.”</p> <p>She reached forward, holding the vibrator against my anus, then slipped it inside me. I cried out at the sensation. She moved the vibe back to my pussy, and I spread my legs so she couldn’t slip it inside of me. She slid the vibe in and out, and I moved it around in my own ass. “Do you like that, sir?”</p> <p>‘Yes, sir! I love it! Do it hard!” She loved to say it, and there was no hiding it. I had never heard such utter contentment before she said what she did, but I couldn’t take my eyes off of her.</p> <p>"I love your ass.” She said as she moved it back and forth and in and out of my ass. I felt her reach around my pussy again, rubbing my clit at the same time. “Do you like that, sir?”</p> <p>“Yeah,” I responded. I could feel it. It was like the feelings I felt when I felt a man’s cock inside me on top of me—the feel of a man fucking me—the feeling of a man moving in and out of me. Her fingers were now in my pussy, stroking my G-spot and rubbing in circles. “Yes," I breathed. “Fuck it. Fuck it! Do it!”</p> <p>I felt like I had a cock in my ass. I was in heaven, feeling—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
