He quickly climbed on top of her as she screamed and moaned, "OHMYGOD! Aaaaaaaahhhhhh! Y-Y-YESSSSSSS OHHHH SHIT!! G-G-G-G-GAAAAAAHHHHH!! I'M CUMMMINGGG!!" He felt her vagina convulse as her whole body spasmed and shuddered.</p> <p>"Aahhhh...aaaahhhhh!!! FUCK!! FUCK!! FUCK!! AAAAHHHH FUUUUUCCCKKKKKK!!"</p> <p>He felt her body go into convulsions as she came on his cock.</p> <p>When they both finished coming, she was laying on the bed, his legs in the air, and his cum still oozing from her pussy while she was still breathing hard. Then she noticed cum dribble out of the eye of his cock. She pulled the head back just a bit and licked the juice off his cock and looked in his eyes as she brought her finger to her mouth and sucked it.</p> <p>"MMMMMMMM...that was delicious, Sir. Your cock is so much yummy!"</p> <p>"Yes...yes it is, baby."</p> <p>He looked over at her and smiled. He kissed her on the lips, softly, and then left her room. He walked back downstairs and saw a light over there indicating that they were still at the party, so he went up stairs knowing that it was after the party and that he just walked up in the kitchen to get a drink.</p> <p>Once he was in it, he walked into the kitchen. There on the kitchen counter was a pink ribbon, which he quickly walked over to it and wrapped it around his head.</p> <p>"I hope all this is well for you," he thought to himself.</p> <p>All was well for him! He had a special birthday for her. It was a day to celebrate his sexual awakening and having the most beautiful and passionate woman he had ever known in his life. She was his first, and he knew it was special for her and for everything else that she had done with him already. He was happy to be the first man to have her. It was more of a feeling and not an obligation that she had made. Of course, in most cases, it would be a more sexual experience for her too. She was just a little different. She had a different personality too. She seemed to be a more outgoing and aggressive person. He was happy to be the first man to have the chance to have this woman, even if it was only him being her first.</p> <p>After the party, they went out to the back yard to enjoy the backyard and the sun in the backyard. They were both sitting on the swing at this point, which was also his favorite.</p> <p>"So, Sir, about what exactly happened to you that day with that black stripper on a pole?"</p> <p>"Well, it happened for a lot of reasons, actually. It did, though it's not something I mentioned. The truth is that it's something that a lot of people have tried to do but have failed. I do things to her that they didn't mean and that I can't even begin to do because she would have never even seen me doing it. I guess I've found a part of me that has taken over. That's the part that everyone has taken care of. That's the main reason that I do this for you. It works for everyone, even if I never have done it with anyone else."</p> <p>"So, that's why her and I aren't doing this? So, that's why it did happen with her?"</p> <p>"Yes, it is with me and it will work for everything else that you and I do together, at least for now. But, I want to get to know her, so I should probably start being more casual in doing this with her and get to know her better. So, I hope that you can understand what I mean. If it isn't too much for you to know, we'll see how you feel about it."</p> <p>"Ok, so, now that I know that she likes it, it might be time for me to try to have her sometime. I mean, don't you think that she deserves a chance to get out here and do something? She may not be as wild as this stripper, but she'll be a lot more fun. And, since you haven't seen everything, I'm sure that you would understand why we couldn't do it."</p> <p>"Ok, I guess, but it might be good to get her out of this house in one piece." He said.</p> <p>"No, not that. You can just stop here, if you want. It'll really save you from everything."</p> <p>"You don't thinkâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
