He loved how easily she moved and she took him all the way. She reached around behind him to rub her hard clit against him as he drove in her. His hand went to the small of her back to pull her toward him even harder. If he were a man, he would have been in her more right then.</p> <p>They had been going at it for at least an hour, and she had been so hot and wet. He was very proud of the way he could make her feel and enjoy being a slut. He knew if he could make her cum at least twice over the course of the next 20 to 30 minutes, he would make it very memorable. Her legs were bent and spread. Her lips were flushed and swollen. She made no complaint.</p> <p>As if on cue, he pulled her off him and turned her around. She let him set her down then she got on all fours. She loved to be taken that way. He moved behind her, put his cock at her opening and drove inside her with the precision of a jackhammer. She let out a long groan and thrust back at him, matching his rhythm. It was an absolutely awesome feeling as he began to really pound her. She loved it when he would hit bottom and not withdraw. Sometimes, it was just a hard thrust. The pleasure she got from the feeling of him moving inside her was incredible. She felt his pelvis against her bottom and wanted him to pull out all the way.</p> <p>He didn't take long to get his load and pulled out.</p> <p>"Your turn," he told her.</p> <p>She rolled over and he had her suck some of it off of his finger.</p> <p>"You taste delicious."</p> <p>Then she laid back down on the carpet, inviting him.</p> <p>"Come on," he said, "I want to taste you. I'm not about to make you wait just yet."</p> <p>He lay down beside her and began licking her from her clit to her pussy and back again. She spread her legs wide for him, exposing herself for his pleasure. His tongue moved inside her. Oh my God. She was so wet, he really enjoyed the feeling of her. Just like this night.</p> <p>She closed her eyes and let herself go. She had never felt like this before in her life. She didn't notice his hand come up to the head of the bed until she felt him enter her from behind. He wasn't any deeper in then that cock. They were both in their own world, her at the moment and him at the moment.</p> <p>Her legs were spread wide for him. He moved slowly until he felt she could take no more. She could tell he was ready and was about to give her the release she so desperately wanted. He began to push deeply within her, moving slowly at first. The combination of both of her juices and his cock made it so hot and snug within her. Her back arched every time he would pull out.</p> <p>"Faster, please" she whispered.</p> <p>"Please" was his reply. "Cum with me."</p> <p>She could feel her pussy pulsing and pulsing every time his cock made contact with her clit. The feeling of him inside her only seemed to drive her closer and closer to the edge. She loved the feeling of him filling her up. It was driving her further and further toward release. Her back arched, as she clenched his cock tight. Her toes curled, as she exploded onto the bed with the intensity of her climax. She could feel her juices running down her legs over to him and down his balls. She loved the feeling of her hot cum in his crotch.</p> <p>When she came down, he kissed her mouth and her tits. She looked at him with wide eyes. He was breathing hard.</p> <p>"I like you taking care of me. I like you giving me a good fucking."</p> <p>He got up and began to walk away, his cock flapping wildly as he walked. But then he smiled and got up off the bed. He went into the room, and she felt a moment of disappointment. But it was gone.</p> <p>He walked back into the room and she knew he'd come back again for some more. She was his for the next few hours. She wanted to please him again. She wanted to cum with him again. She wanted to suck his cock again. And she wanted him to use her in every way and no limit.</p> <p>When he got back, she was curled up on his bed, her eyes closed, her fingers lightly playing with her clit. He stood over her, looking at her from the doorway. She felt his presence in her presence, as if it were his eyes that had told her to be his forever. She felt everything that it seemed like. Everything and nothing.</p> <p>Sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
