I quickly rolled on my own side to face her. I could see a smile on her face as she looked me in the eye. "That was a nice way to come home."</p> <p>"I'm glad you liked it. This is not what I had in mind." I told her.</p> <p>"That's nice."</p> <p>"I'm ready anytime now," I said.</p> <p>"So are you."</p> <p>"As always."</p> <p>I pulled her into my arms and kissed her again. This time she didn't struggle at all and let it happen. This was a moment that was bound to happen. My heart swelled with love for her in that moment. I slowly moved from kissing her to kissing her neck, then her shoulders. She groaned a little more as my lips kissed her. I kissed her face several times, finally working on her lips. I pulled away from her mouth and made a quick sweep with my tongue. She looked at me as if she wouldn't touch me if she put her tongue on my lips. We kissed each other some more, with a small but noticeable change in the air. It was enough to signal that the kisses had now come. Then we broke the kiss, our breath coming out hard. We just looked at each other for a while and then turned to walk down the hall to our bedroom.</p> <p>I slowly pulled her door open and then walked in, pulling her toward me after I sat down in my chair. I laid her down on the bed, where she quickly threw her legs over mine, leaving them on the side facing the door. There was no need to hurry this time and she quickly pushed me on to my back and kissed me hard. She looked down at me and gave me a devilish smile. Her eyes were wild with desire, I could see it in her expression.</p> <p>"I'm not sure if I can take it." I said softly.</p> <p>"Oh yes you can."</p> <p>She got on top me and slowly began to kiss her way from my eyes, to my mouth, then down to my neck. She looked into my eyes the whole time, licking my lips at each pause of her mouth on my neck. I just stared back at her as she worked her way down my torso. She reached my waist and slowly worked her way up until she reached the waistline of my jeans. She undid my zipper, her mouth only inches from my cock. She slowly reached down with her hand, her eyes locked on mine, and began to stroke my length, slowly at first and then faster and faster. I was in heaven, and I could feel my erection starting to stiffen. I reached up to her and grabbed a handful of her hair as she continued to stroke my shaft.</p> <p>"Oh yeah..." I heard from her, "suck my cock, suck my dick, make me cum."</p> <p>"Are you ready to be me?" I was in heaven, this was the best I had ever been! She just smiled and got up, getting herself on the bed next to me. I took the initiative and flipped her around to face away. She looked back at me as she spread her legs wide. I wasted no time lining my way in between her legs and slowly pushed forward. I slowly entered her as she let me have my way, moaning softly at the sensation. I let my hips start to rock in time to my hips. I was getting more and more worked up, and as we both started to lose control I pushed one final time into her as she wrapped her legs around me. The combination quickly brought me to my own orgasm, I could feel my body beginning to react to her after all the teasing that she had put me through. I kept on pounding into her, feeling her orgasm start deep in my groin. As my cock started to lose its load, she reached for my cock, still rock hard. She pulled my cock out of her and guided it to her pussy, which I quickly slid slowly into with one smooth thrust. She was tight! Even her hymen and most of her hymen had not been used in a long time. I quickly pulled out of her and moved my head to kiss her passionately on the lips. We both just couldn't get enough of each other. She slowly moved her hand to my cock and began to jack me off as fast as she could. I could feel her fingers as she pumped my shaft. With each stroke I would moan for real, so I couldn't keep on moaning for long. The feeling was just too incredible. She stopped her stroking and just looked back and smiled. I just groaned as it finally stopped. We just lay there, kissing. I pulled her up into my arms and held her as we both recovered. She kissed me hard, pulling away from the kiss at my lips and then licking my lips. She held me tight in her armsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
