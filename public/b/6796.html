"I was only doing it because of my feelings for you."</p> <p>"I know," I said quietly. "That's why it was so perfect. I wanted you to be the one, the one that felt as complete as you did, and I wanted to be the one to be completely in charge."</p> <p>I kissed her again and she reached between us for my cock. I had a thought and held still, not moving, not wanting to come. I felt her body quivering as I reached around under her and found her clitoris.</p> <p>"That was really awesome," she whispered. "I needed it so bad. I've never done anything like this before."</p> <p>She moved to kiss me, but I gently pushed her back, "Let's go take a shower," I said.</p> <p>In the shower, I thought how fortunate I was to always be around. I wondered how I would be able to cope with being in this situation when my life and marriage had just turned out. I wondered if I could ever trust myself again. It seemed so far away from the reality I felt at this moment.</p> <p>We took our clothes off and I took her into to the shower. She climbed in and I took my shower. I soaped her body as if I was going to wash someone else's body. Her nipples hardened under my touch as I took my time kneading her breasts. I slid a soapy finger into her pussy when I soaped her ass. She moaned in surprise and pushed back against my finger.</p> <p>I continued to work her body with soap. She moved against me as we stood under the spray. My cock was aching with her body in the water. She was moaning and moving against my finger and my cock. There's one hell of an orgasm to go around.</p> <p>Finally we came up for air and I got out first, turning her around to rinse her off. She turned and reached round to rinse my cock and balls. She looked at my cock and smiled.</p> <p>We dried off and I took her by the hand and led her to the bed. I lay down first. She climbed up on me and lay back on my body. Her hot pussy was on my cock, ready to take me, ready to engulf my hardness. She felt so soft down there, her muscles so firm to my cock. I looked at her face and saw she was smiling for me.</p> <p>"Fuck me," she said.</p> <p>I reached forward and began to slide her towards me. She spread her legs wide, her pussy wide open. Her beautiful wetness enveloped me as I positioned my cock and reached up to touch her pussy lips. I could tell she was wet and ready, just waiting for me to enter her. I rubbed the head up and down her slit and across her clit, taking my time and caressing her and telling her to take me.</p> <p>I pushed forward with my hips and felt my cock enter her as it slid into her soft warmth. She felt so warm and wet inside. I slid in deeper, pushing further every time until I was balls deep. I took my hands away of her and held her up as I thrust my cock into her, pulling her on top of me. I reached around and began to finger her clit as I fucked her.</p> <p>My cock slid in and out of her pussy like a piston, all the way to my hilt. I felt her pussy tighten around me and felt it contract in waves around the head of my cock. Her pussy walls were milking mine as she slid on top of me. I could tell she was getting closer to my orgasm and I gave myself to her as no woman ever had. My cock started a slow rocking motion within her as she moved up and down me. I moved my hands to her ass and began moving her up and down. Her cunt felt so good on my cock. I had to stop moving when I thought I would come, but my body took over and I could feel a massive wave coming on as my cock swelled in her.</p> <p>I held her up and pulled her body around before taking her into my arms and slowly pulling her down to lie on top of me. She stayed the while catching her breath and I could tell she was feeling good, but also tired and needed rest. I held her and stroked her body gently.</p> <p>"You have the most incredible pussy I've ever felt," I said.</p> <p>"Mmmm, thank you, thank you," she said sounding a lot tired. "I think I'm going to fall asleep soon."</p> <p>The next thing I knew I slept naked, with cum on me, with the woman I love.</p> <p>To Be Continuedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
