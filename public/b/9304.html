I did some great things. I have never felt like you do. But the thing that really impressed me was in the eyes of the world. They say it's the greatest thing in the whole world, especially when you have the right people. You do all the dirty work you've always wanted to in the world." She smiled, "And now that I'm done, you can come with me. The world doesn't work too bad if you have it from the start." She held up a cup and smiled, "So, this is your chance."</p> <p>"I think of it like there is a great band in my old stomping grounds. I'm just out there on a mission." He said, the image of her standing there with the red leather band in her hand still flashing through his mind. It wasn't one he'd heard from in such a long time. It wasn't anything he'd ever imagined, no, he'd never actually thought of himself as a band, but she had. And now, when she put her arm around his waist with a smile that didn't belong, he looked up at her with a twinkle in his eye. She gave him a slight nod and a smile. "We'll make it work."</p> <p>"We?"</p> <p>"Yeah, we better. The band is just the ticket to us in the business. And we're gonna play you like no other gig ever."</p> <p>"Not that I'd mind." He said.</p> <p>"Then let's get down there." She put on a CD and turned away from him, "The band should be starting up soon."</p> <p>He followed her back up the stairs, and sat down in the chair in the back of her closet. She closed the door and turned to look at him. "Oh, come on," she said, "we have three days to play these kinds of gigs."</p> <p>"I'm kidding."</p> <p>"No. You don't have a choice in the matter, and I'll make sure every one of us does."</p> <p>"But..." she trailed off, then she sighed and crossed her arms. "We're not playing it. We have to stay out of the spotlight."</p> <p>"That you can get past." He said.</p> <p>She shook her head. "And who do you think that someone had already agreed to, when all we've been doing is hanging out somewhere in the corner of our rooms?" She put out her hand and gave him a kiss. "No, this isn't a game. It's your first time."</p> <p>He nodded. "Okay." He said, "That's good." He put his hands up and looked down. "This whole thing has really been bothering me."</p> <p>"Well, for as long as I can remember." She looked up at him, "You know if this ever came out on video, there would be hell to pay for it. And I have an idea for a way of doing it."</p> <p>Now she was smiling. "That might sound ridiculous..." she shook her head. "Look, we can get out of this. That's something we have to do."</p> <p>He put his hands up. "It's just...that," he said, "that is so weird I'm sure it's weird for you...I mean...that it's really not as weird as you think it is." He sat back in his chair and took a deep breath. She walked behind him, turned around and kissed him on the neck.</p> <p>"You've got a great ass." She commented.</p> <p>"And I feel it every time I see you."</p> <p>"If we stay topless and you're astride me, it shouldn't be a problem." She leaned down and let her tongue circle his earlobe. Then she turned him. "But since you're a little man, you're going to stand up for me." She smiled as he watched her lips trail over his neck, her lips soft and slow. "Honey, if we're gonna do this with no music, I want to do it right. Okay?"</p> <p>"Right." He sat down heavily.</p> <p>"So...if you're not a little man, then why don't you just do it your way?" She stood up, went to the door and locked it with her key. She came to him again, put her hands on his shoulders and leaned in, "You don't have to do what I want. You're too smart."</p> <p>He watched as she put on her strap on. She walked back to where he sat on the chair in front of the closet, and sat down on it, facing away from him. She pulled a blind fold off and sat down on the bed.
