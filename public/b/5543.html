I reached out and ran my fingers from her neck to her shoulder blade, and then back to the other arm, my fingers gliding over her skin the same time. Her skin was so soft. I traced my fingers down her shoulders and her back, feeling a little more daring every time.</p> <p>"We need to get you back upstairs," I said softly. "You were so tense before," I added, and kissed her ear once again.</p> <p>"I'm not going to be tense around anyone," she murmured, her eyes closed as she lay there for a moment, feeling my hands exploring her chest and stomach, as if I might let go of her breast, but knowing there was no way I could, that I would not touch her.</p> <p>"I am, baby," I whispered. "Your breasts are beautiful."</p> <p>I kissed her cheek again, feeling the soft, smooth skin there, feeling the softness of her skin. And my fingers trailed down the edge of her chest again. I let my fingers touch her there as if they were a feather, and I felt the goosebumps all over her skin.</p> <p>Her nipples were as hard as diamonds, and she moaned as I caressed her. I kissed my way down her chest to her breasts. Then I put my lips and tongue back on her chest, and it felt so amazing when I touched her. I flicked my tongue over her nipples again, and she moved her hands up to my head again, pressing me closer against her breasts. I licked each one, and she groaned as I ran my tongue around her areola. Her hand moved down to the skin of her tummy, where my fingers ran over her, feeling the curves of her ribs.</p> <p>I moved my tongue down her tummy, pausing to run circles of my tongue down the inside of her navel. She let it follow the trail between her navel and her belly button, feeling my hand running up her stomach, feeling the curve of her waist, feeling how smooth it was. Her body arched into my hand as I touched her skin, feeling that there was a thin line of hair to her pussy.</p> <p>Taking my hand out of her body I put it back to her side. She raised her hips to shift from my hand. And her hand came down, resting on my shoulder. I traced my finger across her skin in a lazy, lazy circle, until I got to her pussy lips. I slowly stroked over them, and then started to circle her clit, stroking her lips with pressure, rubbing all around her lips and up and down as I stroked. I watched her face with that expression, a beautiful expression she was enjoying from both ends. I closed my eyes, and let my eyes roam over the body of her, drinking her in. My fingers stroked up and down her lips, rubbing the inside of them as they moved up to her clit. I felt her wetness, as I stroked it. When I touched her clit, she moaned, and moved her hips against my hand.</p> <p>I slowly opened my eyes up, and saw that she was looking back at me with such hunger, a lust, a need in her eyes. Her mouth was open in that look, and her eyes were wet with moisture. I knew I had to have this woman. I was going to.</p> <p>I kissed her, and our tongues met again, and I could taste her lips on mine. It was so intoxicating, and I felt her hands in my hair, pulling at it as she pulled my mouth closer. I let her go, and her hands moved down from my hair, over to my breasts, where she cupped them, feeling them, as I was touching her, feeling her. I moved my hands to her shoulders, and she put her feet together, pressing them against my chest, as my hands ran back up her thighs.</p> <p>"Please," I breathed huskily into her ear.</p> <p>"Please what?" she responded.</p> <p>"Please fuck me," I said, moving up from her shoulders, feeling her back arch, feeling the muscles there beneath my hands slide to her sides.</p> <p>She turned around and sat on the chair, facing the table. I kneeled on the floor, on the wooden edge, with one knee on each side of her, so that my pelvis would grind on her, to drive my cock deep into her pussy. And I took hold of her breasts, sliding them into her hands as my body came down and pushed her legs apart. I knelt on my knees in front of her, and felt her hands on my back, pulling me down and kissing me, and her hands all over my body. Her body was so soft, and I held her waist as my body went forward, taking my cock all of the way into me.
