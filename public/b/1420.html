So I took her home before getting into the car or driving myself home. She had been nice. She seemed a little shy and had not done anything suggestive to try and get me to let her know how I really felt and I had tried to keep my feelings at bay.</p> <p>Anyway, after kissing the lips of my future wife to thank me for the evening, I pulled the car off of the road and took her home. She got out of the car and opened my door for me to come inside. She led me into to the living room where the table and chairs were empty. I sat down in one of the chairs and she went back to her bedroom to get a drink from the refrigerator. "It's about time," I muttered to myself as she returned.</p> <p>"My God," I thought to myself, "...he is so beautiful."</p> <p>After a brief drink and a few more small talk she sat down on the couch. There was an attractive blonde woman in one of her short dresses sitting next to her. They turned to look at each other. There was a little light in the bedroom which created a slight amount of shadow. The woman with the short dress smiled at me and then turned to the other woman sitting next to her.</p> <p>The blonde was sitting up straight in her chair and looking directly at my future wife. "I'll be right back with more wine," she smiled.</p> <p>"I'm so embarrassed," I told her.</p> <p>I was only getting up to the bedroom door when I received an unexpected shock. "Damn," I thought to myself, "I'll have to get rid of these clothes and get rid of that big lump in my pants...I can't wait any longer!"</p> <p>Now to make sure I wasn't embarrassing my girlfriend who had just given me a blowjob for the first time when I was in my 30's, I grabbed the hem of my shirt and rolled it up and pulled it over my head. As my girlfriend sat in a chair next to me as the blonde pulled the thin material up her chest, I could see her right nipple poking through the thin top and her left one straining against the material of her dress.</p> <p>When I got back to the living room where I had just come from, the woman with the short dress was talking to her friend. The red head got up and came up behind the blonde and undid the strap, the neckline dropping down to the woman's waist where one of the breasts, like the blonde's, was exposed. Both the women turned to glance at me a few times over the next few minutes and the first thing my girlfriend did was to reach out and grab a handful of breast.</p> <p>The hand she had on the back of the blonde was quickly covering her mouth before the red head had a chance to react. "Get out of here," I thought, "You're embarrassing me with your friend's naked tits." I had my mouth dry when the redhead spoke again. "That's how I see him." The redhead said, "The first time he's seen a woman. You should try it." I could hear them saying something to each other but neither of them noticed. I was shocked and stunned but the other person in the room just sat there.</p> <p>The man in the chair had the blonde completely naked and that was the last thing I remembered. I was startled when I re-entered our bedroom and saw that the lights were still on in the living room. "Oh. my. God," I thought. "That was very embarrassing."</p> <p>I got up and went into the den, sitting in my chair across from the TV. I couldn't look at the woman in the blonde's bra and top that I had just seen. I was so focused on the two females that I didn't hear my wife come into the room at all. Her face, which was so red and swollen from standing under the water that I could see the contour of her skin under the water, was flushed but her eyes were still closed. "What went on here?" I thought as I sat and watched what happened next.</p> <p>The blonde with the dress on came out of the bedroom and walked over to the couch. The skirt was now showing a little more thigh than I realized, but the top wasn't covering much. "I'm sorry," she said as she sat down and started taking the two items from my hands. "I didn't know you were done."</p> <p>I was stunned. The redhead had the red bra on. The red bra didn't have any visible openings but there was a wide cleavage in the front of the bra and there looked to be plentyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
