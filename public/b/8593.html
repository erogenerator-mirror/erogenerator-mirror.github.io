But it feels more than a little comfortable.</p> <p>"That's nice. I was afraid he'd stop," Ann moans, still holding herself up, "I couldn't take it."</p> <p>"It's still hard," I whisper in her ear, "I can go a little farther."</p> <p>"A lot," she says, "not just for him, but for me too."</p> <p>She leans back onto me, and I slip a finger up into her. I can feel her moving beneath me, a little as I press back, but it doesn't feel all that different from the way I'm feeling right now. She reaches back and takes my hand off her bottom, and looks at me. "My panties."</p> <p>"Are you going to put them on now?"</p> <p>She doesn't answer, but leans down a little further. My finger is wet from her vagina as I stroke myself inside her.</p> <p>"Oh God," I think," this is how she wants me, this feels good, not just from her own hand.</p> <p>"Come on, I'm your little sister," she says to me. I look at her and reach up and grab her ass. I put my fingers on the top of her panties, which I hold in place in place by the waistband, and put my hands on her ass, and put my fingers against her rear. I take one of her cheeks in my hand and lift it. She shudders just a tiny bit beneath me. I press her backside against me, and push in farther, but before I can start pushing any further, Ann shucks my hand.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I ask her.</p> <p>"Yes," she hisses, "more than anything."</p> <p>I pull up in front of her apartment and start back down, her panties almost completely gone from her rear. She reaches out and holds the front of her skirt at her hips, her skirt bunched up around her waist as she lays bare beneath my fingers. I kiss my way up her legs and over her bottom to her thighs. She kisses and kisses, and then spreads her legs apart for me. The feel of her bare bottom against my cheek is like nothing I've felt before. I reach out and take one of her bottom cheeks, holding her by it, and pull, as I kiss her, kissing her, kissing the inside of her cheeks, my lips, and my tongue sliding up and down along and under the delicate pink skin of her bottom.</p> <p>Ann moans when my chin touches her. I'm getting off her, but she's not pulling away this time. I just keep going. I feel her bottom rubbing up and down my face. I can feel her pussy and her wet panties sliding along mine. I kiss my way along her back and feel her bottom pressing back against my chin, rubbing on my lips.</p> <p>I kiss her bottom again, and let my tongue slide across her lips, then into her bottom. Ann moans and bucks, grinding herself a little to make herself grind the head of my cock, but she wants my tongue in her bottom. I want to, but I've put all I'm worth into letting me eat her out, feeling this little nub against my tongue.</p> <p>She's moving herself all over my mouth now too. I keep moving my hands up and down her bottom. I reach out and find her lips, and slowly rub them between mine. I slide my tongue around the edges of hers and feel her mouth open a little, her tongue sliding back out too, and my hands move from her bottom to rest on her breast, her hard nipple in my hands. I can feel her pushing up against me now, and I rub along her bottom and up to her clit.</p> <p>"Ah, God," she hisses at me, "fuck me."</p> <p>I don't fuck her, but I'm already looking at the clock in her window, and she pulls my hand away. "I'm going to take a shower. You stay here, I'll meet you up there."</p> <p>Ann moves and stands up. I lay back down beside her, she comes over, pulls her panties off to the floor, and stands in front of me. I look at her. She's naked. Her breasts have been smaller than they were when we arrived, now a little larger. I can actually see the edges of her areolas, her nipples hard in the cold air. She's not the most beautiful of women I've seen, but her nude body is still hot. I feel her against me, and run my hands along her flat ass, feeling her skin, feeling that perfect rounded buttock against me. I can still feel her bottom rubbing against me. And even better, it feels so good against my cock again.
