I have a feeling I won't last as long as it lasts."</p> <p>"But don't you worry about that."</p> <p>"Yeah, I don't..."</p> <p>"That's all?"</p> <p>"It might not last forever."</p> <p>"And now you're going to have to stop fucking him."</p> <p>"It's only in the next few months," I mumbled, thinking back to the first time I saw him.</p> <p>"Well, then, it's only in the next few years, right?"</p> <p>I laughed bitterly. "That's one thing all right isn't it."</p> <p>"The next few years are gonna be the best years of my life. I can get on my way, but I'm going to have to get him back. And then he's coming home."</p> <p>Hurt I thought. I'd always known this one.</p> <p>A few months later, I was sitting in the living room at home when I heard the front door open.</p> <p>"It's just Matty!" I said.</p> <p>Matty smiled brightly. "You can't just let him come in."</p> <p>"So we are! You had to wait for me!"</p> <p>"What's up? I'll just be in bed with him."</p> <p>"Sure, I suppose."</p> <p>"We'll just wait for the party to start." I saw her eyes dart away. "Come in."</p> <p>"How'd he do?" I asked curiously.</p> <p>She walked in through the front door slowly. "He's still angry. And you?"</p> <p>"He's been looking pretty good for him right now, but he's aching to go out sometime."</p> <p>I couldn't help but give her a knowing look. "I don't get it!" But I didn't have to be a bitch to Matty. "What did you do today?"</p> <p>"Nothing. I just dropped him off at the front of the house. So I think we finished up."</p> <p>"I don't know what to say."</p> <p>"Don't say anything."</p> <p>"Can't we just talk a little?" I said.</p> <p>"No, please don't! We both know you're only trying to help us." she added quickly, turning to sit on the couch and giving me a weak smile.</p> <p>With a resigned look, I turned to walk to my bedroom without taking my eyes off her. She was still sitting there when I walked by her and I didn't look back.</p> <p>"What?" she said at last. What a disappointment.</p> <p>What? I couldn't think of a single reason why she couldn't help me.</p> <p>It was no longer an emotion I felt. I was simply an emotional relief. I needed to tell her so she could find a way to make it up to me. I looked from her to my new toy. "Matty, I'm done. You're still here. I have to leave now."</p> <p>She reached to me and gave me a warm embrace. "You're right. He's a loser. He has been trying for months to get into my pants." She began to unbutton her blouse. "Come and sit on the couch with me. We can talk a lot."</p> <p>"Sure, yeah, it's been fun the last few months, but it's like we've known each other forever." There was a little sadness in my voice, but I couldn't make myself see past it. "Let's stay here for just a little bit." She nodded to the bedroom.</p> <p>"No. I'm tired. It's been a long day."</p> <p>"Don't go. You want to talk with me, right?"</p> <p>"Of course. Come on!" she said, lifting her head from her shoulder. She held her arms forward and I couldn't help but notice she had been wearing a little strapless bra. She looked over her shoulder at me. "I'm not doing anything to you. And I don't have permission to..."</p> <p>"Yeah, right. You've already said that. Don't worry."</p> <p>"It's all right." She put a small kiss on my soft lips. "Come on." She picked up a blanket and started to toss it to the side across the room.</p> <p>"Stop." I wasn't about to tell her no or force her to stop. She stood and stepped over me, pulling me into a tight hug. "I'm sorry. It's been a tough day. I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry Matty. For what I did. Please, let me talk to you. We'll talk about it when Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
