"I don't know. We've been married a long time."</p> <p>"You'll marry me?" I asked her. Her face lit up once again. "Does it mean we'll have another child?"</p> <p>"No," she assured me. "But you don't have to marry me. If you would like to marry me, I'll do the same."</p> <p>I wanted to say yes, but hesitated. I loved her dearly and there was no harm in telling her to marry me.</p> <p>"Of course," she giggled. "I'd love to be your woman. That's why we've been married so long."</p> <p>"But I thought—"</p> <p>"I know," was all she said.</p> <p>Her face was now flushed and her blue eyes were sparkling.</p> <p>"I know," I confessed.</p> <p>I had a sudden flashback to the wonderful feeling of her breasts against mine as we made love. There was a vague memory of a woman that we hadn't met yet; and then the memory disappeared as quickly as it had come.</p> <p>"Mmm," was the first she spoke. "I have a confession to make."</p> <p>I pulled her to me and kissed her. We kissed long and deep, our tongues trying to get each other wet. Our kissing was becoming more passionate with every minute that passed by, and my erection was building up. She broke the kiss long enough to say.</p> <p>"You sure have a lovely tongue," but she said nothing for a while. Finally I broke the kiss and looked her in the eyes.</p> <p>"Come to my bedroom. I want to make love with you."</p> <p>She took my arm and we hurried along the walkway to her bedroom. When we got to the bedroom she turned on the lights, turned around while still on her feet, and held out her arms for me. I quickly slipped off my pants and followed her. She pushed me against the wall, kissing my neck while she kneaded my breasts through the thin material of my bra. Then, without breaking our kiss, she slid it off, her lips nibbling at my nipples before moving down my stomach, her hands going under the waist of my dress. I was suddenly acutely aware of how damp my panties were, the coolness of her touch causing the dampness to increase.</p> <p>She slipped her hands inside the fabric and pulled upwards, easing the wet gusset off my legs, leaving me nude before her.</p> <p>"Yes," is all she said before dropping to her knees and taking my already-rigid cock into her mouth. It felt odd to have another woman's mouth on my cock, but she seemed to know exactly what to do, sucking the flesh between her teeth until the head peeked at the corners of her mouth. The feeling of her hot mouth almost overwhelmed me as her tongue gently slid over the length, before moving down to my balls, licking and teasing them. My erection throbbed in her mouth, filling her eyes with lust as I felt my cock swell even more. Suddenly I became aware of her right hand between her legs and a single finger rubbing against her engorged clit.</p> <p>"A penny for your thoughts," she said softly. "And yes, I will marry you," she added. "But you must make me your wife first, okay?"</p> <p>She paused and let me come to the point of no return as I watched her eyes. They were glazed with passion and desire and I felt a shudder of excitement at the sight of her being so beautiful.</p> <p>"I will have to trust you. Will you marry me and make love with me?"</p> <p>I nodded, my breathing still unsteady while her mouth continued to work my cock while I watched. Her hand seemed to move inside it and I could tell she was stroking herself. Then suddenly her lips moved to the tip of my cock, she kissed as she pulled the skin up against its surface and then slid her mouth to the head. She took a large handful of my spunk and brought it to her lips. Then she licked the head, savoring the taste of me, before lowering her head to take it again into her warm mouth. She repeated the process several times, until finally we had established a rhythm that required some of my cooperation. I had not expected to have to make such a big commitment to a lovely woman like her.</p> <p>At long last we stood there, she on her knees, me behind her, slowly stroking her hair as her hands slid back up my stomach as though she was adjusting my weight to her. She was a wonderful teacher, and I was a hopeless student. By the time my second ejaculation hit me, all the resistance left my mind, and, I think I said it so softly I almost didn't notice the sudden rise of my hips—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
