Oh, God, they need to get a grip of what I just said."</p> <p>And while this is all becoming so much, I want to make up for all I did on a level I don't quite feel. But, you see, I am not just going to make up for it, I'm going to try. Because you may also get a chance to experience a bit of a bigger than average cock before too long. And I'm glad you're liking it. Because now you're wondering if you're going to be okay with it."</p> <p>"You're kidding right?"</p> <p>"Hey, no kidding," I tell her, laughing once more. "I just wonder, too. Now if you just want to know, I'm fucking horny."</p> <p>Her eyebrows lift slightly, but she laughs along with me, and I'm not sure if it's the alcohol, that's making me giggle or if it's the way I'm feeling. But, I don't move at all for very long. I'm just enjoying letting her know just how incredibly excited and aroused I've become. The fact that I can't possibly be doing this in her bed, alone, isn't even a concern. "I just know it's going to be a while. You're going to have to just be patient for me."</p> <p>When I say it like that, she's totally okay with it. "Oh, I trust you more than that. Now we're on the same page."</p> <p>She's right. It's like when they were at the beginning when we were on the way back down. It's not that we are making out right away, it's we're actually having sex. It's more like she wants to take me a bit further, and the only way to do that is to make sure I am enjoying the ride, not that she has that choice. Her pussy is wet now, which means it has taken a little time to get used to the fact that she isn't totally satisfied right now. Maybe it is a bit of a change, as it's obvious I love her.</p> <p>While I can't say I'm particularly fond of cock, I do care for it. I love being able to suck and fuck someone with the skill and passion I love to be able to take a cock and deep throat. I like to lick and suck guys' balls while they cum, too. That's something I've done with a few guys, and I love to feel the hot sperm that shoots into my throat. And although I do love my cum, it doesn't taste as bad.</p> <p>After what I said about getting a bit of a head start, I'm ready to try my luck and go for it. We have both been holding back for a good part of the conversation. I'm going to try, I guess. But, she hasn't stopped me, have she? That is because there's very little else we can say about our conversation. But, I am really just going to try now.</p> <p>I lean over to kiss her, feeling her hand on my thigh as I push it inside my jeans and up to my cock. God, how can I be this man. I'm still so nervous.</p> <p>I do it slowly to let myself sink a little for a bit. In a moment, she is doing the same. Her hand is still on my cock. I feel her other hand rubbing slowly up my leg and up my thigh. She takes the leg under mine and pushes it in a little further, just enough to get the tip of my cock through her thumb. She smiles up at me as she does that, and I've never felt a girl do that before. I love it. I like the way her hand feels on me and the way she moves up and down and around and around it, she's just so... so... so... feminine.</p> <p>She pulls her thumb back out and starts rubbing my cock under the fabric of my jeans. It is warm for me, but I can feel that I'm getting really hard. I'm getting so close to actually letting myself explode. She doesn't stop her movements, but her fingertips are moving in time with my own and her thumb is a little faster. So, my thumb moves around the shaft now, moving in and out. I can feel her hand as it comes up to her wrist, but not exactly inside her hand. I want to take my dick in my hand.</p> <p>I can feel my orgasm coming, but I don't want to take it back. As soon as that happens, I should just let it pass, and not worry about it. I also know, I have the willpower and will power to resist it, so I keep going. My thumb moves on it out and on back and forth from side to sideâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
