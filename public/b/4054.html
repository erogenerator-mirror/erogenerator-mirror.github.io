I like it. It’s really special that way.” I was still feeling kind of guilty I didn’t make the first move towards this beautiful woman.</p> <p>She didn’t respond right away. It was pretty obvious that she still had feelings for me, but now she seemed to have abandoned those feelings. “No, it was nice.”</p> <p>“But you don’t really love me anymore.”</p> <p>“No, but I’m so confused now. You know, you know I’ve been in love with you for ten years now. And I’m really disappointed. And, I guess I’ve been very stupid.” She started to move towards me again, this time with a little more pressure. She looked at me and gave me a knowing smile. “You’re still young and the way your body is. It’s just that I haven’t had a decent man in nearly two decades. When I was young I’d just wanted to find a stud to bang in every hole. Now, I…I have the only one in my life right now and I really want a real man to share that pleasure with.”</p> <p>We continued to kiss for a while, and our bodies slowly melted together in a new place. I let my hands roam over her perfect body as she pulled my shirt tails free from my pants. She had on a long red satin bra that left nothing to the imagination.</p> <p>“Take off your shirt.” She almost purred, but she looked like she was going to argue. I had on an off white shirt, with a few buttons tied into a knot. I pulled my shirt off over my head, tossing it to a discarded shoe. “I still need to get you out of these pants.”</p> <p>She stepped back to admire the view from under her short blue skirt. “I’m sorry. I still can’t resist your body. I really think my body is too good to waste.” I kissed her as we stood in the middle of the room now, rubbing one another slowly and running my tongue along her lips.</p> <p>“You don’t have to do that any more. It feels good to do this to someone you love.”</p> <p>I leaned in for another kiss, then she pushed me backwards, and went to get a pair of sweat pants from the floor. “I’ll fix those later.” She pulled her shirt over her head and sat down next to me. Again, she took my hand in her own and pulled me into her arms, holding me tightly as the kissing heated up a bit.</p> <p>Our hands moved from fondling each other’s body to gently rubbing against each other's. In the dim light, I could see her breasts press against the fabric of her bra as she held me. As her kiss became more and more passionate, I felt my cock grow hard in her hands and her pussy moisten itself.</p> <p>I broke the kiss, looking directly into her eyes and asking, “How many hours ago did you think that we’d both fall in the shower before you could really make this the greatest thing ever?”</p> <p>She smiled, then leaned against me, pressing our chest together. “Just wait, I’m still you”, she giggled softly; as she kissed my chin; then her lips found mine. Our tongue came together, meeting each other in full as our bodies melded together.</p> <p>My cock had grown to almost twelve inches in her hands as she held onto me, pushing her body back onto mine, with the force of her kiss. Our hips grinded together, taking me in fully into her body as she grabbed my ass with both hands, pulling us towards each other with passion and desire.</p> <p>Her mouth opened and she moaned into my mouth as I felt the hard little clit of her clit pressing through the fabric of her panties. Her breasts were pressed up against my chest, and I felt her hands running up and down my back while our kiss continued. They were soft, and her skin felt amazingly sensual against my body.</p> <p>Her hands continued to pull me forward with each kiss, until we were sitting on my bed as we continued to touch each other. My arms were wrapped around her, our breasts touching, while our tongues played with one another. Her hands moved down to my ass, rubbing my ass again, just a bit more, then pushing her hips forward, sliding easily against my erect cock.</p> <p>I stopped kissing her and lifted us up a bit, still holding each other.
