"You need to tell me why, my dear."</p> <p>"I did it, Sir."</p> <p>He knew his submissive would follow his example. He leaned closer to her and held the sides of her head while his fingers traced a line through her hair, down to the scalp and gently combed it behind her ear.</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"Because your breasts will remain bound and untied. It is very important for me to understand. They will be so tender to me I must never forget how they feel. It is important that you do not feel humiliated by it."</p> <p>Mona's arms fell and she sobbed quietly. He kept a reassuring pressure until her voice softened.</p> <p>"I'll tell you my love. A moment ago my body craved this, but now it is so vulnerable it will not be taken lightly."</p> <p>His touch was so light and feathery. Mona shivered at his touch and began to move to the sound of his voice and face. She felt her heart skip from its slow beat, but he continued.</p> <p>"Remember that you did not speak with your mouth closed, so it is time for me to remove the blindfold."</p> <p>She nodded and allowed him to place the cloth over her eyes. It had the strong comforting feeling of being completely uncovered and held in his arms. The gentle caress of his hand and the feel of her own touch were comforting, but the tears slowly started to drip down her cheeks.</p> <p>He ran his finger down her spine and she winced, but did not break the flow. He caressed the round softness of her bottom, and slowly drew a finger to his lips, tasting her body from the tip of it to the bottom, tasting her nectar. He kept the gentle touch, but began to slide his finger to and fro between her cheeks, caressing her ass and her vaginal mound up to her bottom. She was not in pain yet. He continued his caress for several minutes, before he pulled his finger away, but allowed her soft ass to relax after his first pass over her delicate pink flesh.</p> <p>In a few moments, Mona was breathing more heavily and her fingers were back on her breasts, but on his neck. He continued and she kept pushing against his leg with her hips.</p> <p>"May I remove them?"</p> <p>"Yes, Master."</p> <p>He brought his head down and her breasts and they shook with her so much, but he kept her pressed against himself as he lifted one nipple with his warm wet mouth. She was panting as he sucked, and moaned from the feeling of being sucked on the breast and her nipple. Her hands reached across his waist and she placed a hand on his hard cock, as he continued sucking. He held her breast gently while he continued his journey to her bottom. He loved to caress her bottom with a finger, but he loved the feel of it. His tongue slipped lightly over her skin, causing her to shudder and moan.</p> <p>He lifted his head from her bosom when he felt she was going to cum. She trembled a little and he pulled away from her, and took her hand and guided her through a series of steps down the stairs.</p> <p>Once she was standing on the steps, he bent and kissed her softly. His kiss was passionate, slow and deep. When he pulled away, he felt her hands in his hair. He pulled her to him and held her body against his. He loved it when she trembled in his arms and cried out as she orgasmed. Her body jerked a little as it came down, but there was still a sense of release as he rubbed her bottom gently with his palm.</p> <p>He slowly stood back and took Mona by the hand, leading her to the bed. Mona knew this was her first time going down on another man. She watched as he pulled down the sheet and sat her down on the edge. She felt a shiver run up her spine as his hands grabbed her waist to pull her to his lap. She felt his hard cock press against her body with firmness. His hands reached down and lifted her skirt so that when he lifted the skirt, he could see her shaved smooth and swollen lips protruding through the cloth. He had no idea what a clit was until he looked and she was throbbing, showing him that it was a sensitive thing. He lifted her legs so that she was spread wide. He lifted the skirt up a bit more so he could make sure that his cock was positioned so it was directly under her pussy.</p> <p>He sat her on the edge of the bed and knelt on the floor where he could suck her breasts. He massaged them with his hands while he kissed her. As he kissed her, he slowly slid his hands inside her shirtâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
