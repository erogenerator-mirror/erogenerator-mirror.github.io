I guess that my time in front of a camera is not so great anymore. So I have decided to try something different in the same area and try again, which are also in the same time. It is not too hard to come back to these events but I need more information like this. When I am over there, my time in front of that camera is not quite too bad anymore and my time in the next house is still about the same even when I don't know any man here but I'm still feeling the excitement of the event over the last couple of months.</p> <p>- I will start the next episode soon.</p> <p>- Please stay there till it is over. I need to prepare myself for doing this sort of a job.</p> <p>- I think I can handle you but we will start right back. Maybe you can do this again later in my next series.</p> <p>- I'm a long way from the studio. - I can tell you have some problems in this area though.</p> <p>- I can do that next time too. - I just have a couple of thoughts:</p> <p>- My name is Jadava. But you can call me Jadava sometime. -</p> <p>- Why not? - I have asked him before to come back when my apartment is still being built but my roommate has moved in to give us a more space to stay in. I really don't know the apartment any better and I won't know anybody without a couple of nights' leave as a visitor to a city.</p> <p>- Thank you. -</p> <p>- Can I ask you a question? --</p> <p>- You can do it but I need to let you know the details. - I can talk with you while I work on my film.</p> <p>- Is your name Jadava from there? -</p> <p>- Nisha. - I have come to tell you that I also like to use some language, you see.</p> <p>- Why? -</p> <p>- So, I can explain how I am used to speaking it. -</p> <p>- No, actually, I won't ask it, it is just the same as your English.</p> <p>- It's not bad, is it? -</p> <p>- It is only an actor in my film. -</p> <p>- Jadava! -</p> <p>At that moment, I saw Jadava coming. Her hands are in the hands of one of her neighbours - a man of about my age.</p> <p>- Hello? -</p> <p>- My name is Jadava. My name is Jadava. Thanks for the phone call. -</p> <p>- Are you alone? -</p> <p>- No! --</p> <p>- You can come back anytime. -</p> <p>- What time is it! -</p> <p>- Around 7.</p> <p>- I want to talk. -</p> <p>- We will talk in half an hour or so, I have my camera and I will start our film.</p> <p>- Jadavaa</p> <p>- What about? -</p> <p>- Come on already. -</p> <p>- No, I need to have time to change. -</p> <p>- Come on already. -</p> <p>- I will try some time now. Maybe sometime I can do some more than some simple things:</p> <p>- Can I ask you to let me do your photo and then have pictures of me? -</p> <p>- You won't need these either. -</p> <p>- I don't mind. -</p> <p>- You can tell me on the phone if you like, anything.</p> <p>- OK.</p> <p>- OK. -</p> <p>A little while later Jadava called me at my apartment.</p> <p>- Hello? -</p> <p>- I called my roommate to come to come to my apartment. -</p> <p>- I am sorry. -</p> <p>- Please do come, I will come. -</p> <p>- I think I understand. OK now, I am leaving for home. -</p> <p>- Thanks for the call. - -</p> <p>- Bye. - -</p> <p>I thought that Jadava was just a small bit like a friend on the phone who always had needs to be relieved.</p> <p>- Come please, I want to talk for a little bit. -</p> <p>- I don't want to listen to anything else. -</p> <p>- I am just as you said. What should I do now, besides ask you to tell me or something? --</p> <p>- Pleaseâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
