"We are going to have to get you a hotel room, and we're only taking this weekend."</p> <p>"We know, and we'll give us lots to do," Kelli said, her eyes closing a little and her expression turning a little sad. "But I'm glad to have you in my life, even if it means you leave me for me. I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy the prospect."</p> <p>"So you're thinking I'll turn things into a sex thing, right," I replied, with a smirk on my face. "It just seemed to slip out earlier."</p> <p>"That's silly, isn't it? I don't even know you," Kelli said, sounding bitter.</p> <p>"Kylie, what are you talking about?" I asked, trying to convince her. "What are you on about? What can I do to make it up to you?"</p> <p>She sighed and looked away. "I'm just going to stay in the living room and play video games."</p> <p>"But I would love to see you again, and you'd really make our vacation possible," I replied, trying to sound as sincere as possible.</p> <p>She had a thoughtful look on her face that went from her eye lids for an instant to her forehead before she turned and looked up at me, and then she looked away. "That's what we agreed. It's just that, well, you're a lot bigger than your parents are. And I've got two and if you're not there, I'll be back by the end of the month."</p> <p>I got up to get refilled from the kegs that were just leaving, then I left Kelli and went back into the kitchen, where Kelli was fixing up a couple of things for her next get together. When she heard me leaving, she came up to me and gave me a big hug. I felt so relieved to be back with the person I'd been for the past year. She really had a way with words.</p> <p>"So do you want to know where this vacation is going?" she asked, when Kelli handed me the bag and the beer.</p> <p>"We're going to go back to the club and find out where we're going," I said. "I'm not sure it even matters anymore. The only way we'll be able to do anything else right now is with money."</p> <p>Kelli rolled her eyes again. "There are more people there than there are people, after what we've seen today," she said. "The money that I've been receiving from you's business is going into a bank account where it's safe, where it will never go."</p> <p>"You're right, Kelli," I agreed. "There is more money involved involved than just money, Kelli. I'm not getting anything because this is a vacation and I can do what I've started. The only other thing to do is find out how much you're willing to spend on yourself. I'd be lying if I said I wanted you to be my girlfriend."</p> <p>"Well, I don't want to spend all of that money on you," Kelli countered. "I'm not going to spend it all on you, but I want to spend it with you."</p> <p>The only thing I could tell Kelli was that I was willing to spend enough for whatever I could afford. But I also meant every word when I said that I wasn't leaving my mom for an old man to have sex with.</p> <p>"Well, I don't think I'd ever spend all of it on you," I said. "When I left the first time I'd rented a video arcade, I had an idea on how and where and when it would be used. I've been working for the last two years, and I know I'd have a great time watching you and your parents while they played together. But I'm too afraid of what it will take for you to find me. This is just a vacation for me and we're going to be with other people and I don't want to do something to hurt you with all of this money."</p> <p>Kelli was about to hug me again, but changed her mind when she saw that I had the same idea. "Don't worry about it, Kelli, this is just a vacation," I assured her. "I can find a hotel room. I can spend all this money on my family and friends that I'd never spend what I want all the time. Your parents are both going to be with us as long as they want to."</p> <p>Kelli nodded, and then looked back over her shoulder at me with her usual loving expression.
