"What's wrong, Jake?" I whispered in his ear.</p> <p>"You should have called," he said in a serious tone. "Now lets get going."</p> <p>It took us a few minutes to get all the way to the house. When we got to the front door Jake pushed Mandy out the door. On impulse I stepped out onto the porch. When I turned to get in Jake's embrace I saw him kiss my lips, and I wanted more.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful," he says as he kisses me again.</p> <p>"I was hoping we wouldn't get caught," I answered.</p> <p>"Maybe we don't," he said. "But if I'm being stupid I'm all in favor of it."</p> <p>"You really want me to go down that road now?" I asked.</p> <p>"You can go up to your bedroom," he said with a smile. "I'll meet you there and go out to dinner."</p> <p>"I'll go up to my bedroom," I said walking past him to go up the stairs to my room.</p> <p>When I got to my bedroom I undressed and laid down on my bed. I turned on the camera that was sitting next to my night stand still connected on the desk. When I turned around to kiss Jake he was taking pictures of us taking our clothes off.</p> <p>"Do you mind if I stay over tonight?" I asked looking over at him with my beautiful naked body and smiling as he finished taking pictures.</p> <p>"Why don't you sit on the floor next to me," he said.</p> <p>I sat on the bed and Jake stepped over between my legs. His hands were all over me. The bed was too dark and I didn't care, as long as he knew what he was going to do with me that night. Jake leaned down and started licking and kissing Mandy. I could tell they had been making love all night, I just hoped he hadn't been a virgin.</p> <p>Jake took off my panties and started playing with my clit at the same time I let him. When he got to fucking me with his fingers I felt something different because of the angle of his face between my legs. I didn't have to know it was Mandy, not at all the way he was pretending it was me.</p> <p>"You're pussy tastes delicious!" he said pulling his fingers out for a closer inspection.</p> <p>"Do you like my pussy?" I asked still looking in his eyes.</p> <p>"I like every part of it," he said continuing to finger me.</p> <p>While he was doing that I was playing with his cock. I wanted to feel it slide in and out of my pussy so badly I didn't know what to feel about his cock. Finally I couldn't help but run myself over this thing we were going to try. Jake was just doing what Mandy said he was going to do. He did not know it but he did know it too.</p> <p>Jake began to eat my pussy as I played with his cock and his fingers. It wasn't long before I felt it swell even bigger in my hand. "Jake you're doing great!"</p> <p>"Yes baby I'm doing the best job your pussy has ever had!" he exclaimed.</p> <p>Mandy had climbed onto the bed on her hands and knees and was playing with her pussy. I pulled Jake up and kissed him while his fingers played with my clit. It was at that point I took off my panties and lay down next to him. Jake started his finger fucking me even faster. He knew I couldn't last long and he put his hand on Mandy's face and pushed two of them into her mouth.</p> <p>"Oh Jake!" I screamed when he started moving his fingers in her pussy. "I'm going to cum!"</p> <p>"That's what you're going to cum for Jake!" Mandy said.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum!" Jake said as he felt me start to get closer to the edge.</p> <p>"Hold!" I screamed as I climaxed.</p> <p>They laid next to each other on the bed, arms wrapped around each other and kissing again.</p> <p>"I've never felt better in my life," I said to them before rolling on top of Jake. "You can do anything to me."</p> <p>"I think there are many ways we can do that," Jake said.</p> <p>"Let's try," I said. "First let me put a condom on your cock."</p> <p>Jake was behind me and I wrapped my fingers around the head of his cock and put the head in my pussy. It felt great to slide my warm wet pussy around his cock but I needed some lube. I put a generous amount of lubricant on Jake's dick, then reached behind me and grabbed his stiff cock.</p> <p>Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
