I said.</p> <p>"Okay," he said, and leaned forward, touching my face as his fingers ran in my hair, pulling softly. I leaned forward and kissed him again, with a growing excitement, and I cupped both of his hands in mine, as we broke the kiss, and I slid off the edge of the bed and into the bathroom, where I turned on a cold shower before turning off the shower.</p> <p>"Warm enough?" he said with a smile, as he took my body back and hugged me.</p> <p>"Better than cold," I replied. That was the only sound I could hear as he carried me into the bath, my hair clinging to my head as he leaned in for a kiss. I leaned my head back and closed my eyes, wanting to feel his lips on mine as their tongues gently wrestled, his hand slipping down to stroke my mound as his thumb parted my lips again, and I felt his finger slide easily into me, just a little while longer, as I had an orgasm.</p> <p>The bath was not cold and it was very well kept. I didn't bother to clean myself, just sat down in front of him, as his hands slid under me to cup my breasts, and he gently rubbed my nipples until they were hard as rocks. I leaned forward and kissed him lightly and softly, as I reached behind his head and slowly began to unbutton his shirt. When the last button was undone, he slid his hands out of my hair and slid the cloth lower, cupping my butt in his warm hands as he leaned forward and kissed me again, as his free hand slipped into my panties and his fingers began to play my clit and pussy lips.</p> <p>"Oh, J-J-J-Jaaat!" I moaned.</p> <p>"That's my girl!" he said, as he turned me around so my back was facing him, as he moved his body down and lifted my legs onto his shoulders. I felt his face move closer to my pussy, and then a tongue slide across my clit. "Oh, J-Jaaat," I moaned, and I pressed my hips back against his face. As I did, he pushed his index finger deep inside me, and I could feel his tongue circling against my hole, moving around and inside, as his finger was still slowly and lightly massaging my clit.</p> <p>"Jaan," I groaned as I felt my body begin to shudder, and I leaned my body into his hands.</p> <p>Suddenly, as suddenly the water turned on, he raised his finger.</p> <p>"Jaan!" I exclaimed, as I felt both of his hands sliding up my body to my boobs. This time his hand slipped under me to cup my mound as gently as if he could hardly feel my lips. My fingers slid down his chest, and I felt his hard cock as it pressed against my stomach. His right hand worked at my lips as he gently eased the head of his cock out of my mouth, and it slid up and down between my lips, letting me stroke the shaft as it moved up and down.</p> <p>While his fingers stroked, I leaned forward and lifted his left hand off my mound, and gently placed his finger between his thumb and forefinger.</p> <p>He gently began to caress my cheek as I moved my mouth forward, and our lips melted together, and I slipped his finger inside me to make him cum, his finger stroking my inside while his tongue stroked my clit. "Oh, Jaan," I gasped as he pulled his finger out of me, and I reached around and grabbed his stiff cock with one hand.</p> <p>"I could cum right there too," he said, and he lowered his right hand to my nipple. "That would make it worth the long wait, wouldn't it?" he said, as I took his rigid cock in both hands, and slowly began to stroke him to the point it was beginning to tingle, as the pleasure built within me.</p> <p>My hands caressed his shaft in long, slow strokes as my mouth went to his lips. As I stroked him, I could feel his fingers slowly slide downwardâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
