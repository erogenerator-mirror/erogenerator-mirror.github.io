Her eyes ran over several of the muscles on this one leg and even though it was well-rounded and shapely, the one in the black leather pants could not hide the outline of it.</p> <p>"I always thought you were a little older than me," this guy told her. "My name is George. And that's the man I found you with... you know my... your name isn't really important - he just gets on at an inn. But..."</p> <p>"Just a job..." she said, trying to play him, "but I thought you were all a bit young then, too..."</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm older..." he said.</p> <p>"...and I'm sorry for the way I just said it..." she said, with a little laugh, " I'm really sorry for making you feel that way..."</p> <p>"Oh, don't worry about it... I get it," he said.</p> <p>"How old are you, George?" she asked.</p> <p>"18," he answered. He laughed a little when she said that.</p> <p>"Oh, you shouldn't be smiling like that," she said, " I just thought that I'd ask if you'd ever given that up." The smile on his face made her realize how foolish her questions were getting him. Her mind drifted back to her time in college, when she had first done the same stuff to men, just to see how the men reacted. It was not very erotic, but it was fun to see how a man's reaction would react. She liked knowing that they were turned on by her.</p> <p>"Don't look at me like that," she told him, " I'm kidding." She laughed at her own joke, not looking at him.</p> <p>"I don't think I do..." he said, looking into his phone. He shook his head at the fact that she could not even see him from where he was sitting with his back against the fireplace. "We've been out on the town for almost 40 hours, and we've been on business trips. So, you should come with me..."</p> <p>"Oh, OK..." she said. She could see his face relax and the smile reappear as she said it, a little more of fear in her eyes. "You've obviously heard this, and you're probably tired of it already and can't sleep?"</p> <p>"Not really," he said. "I just really liked the first time I went out with you."</p> <p>"So what happened later? You were...?"</p> <p>"I was... having fun. I'm sorry for being too forward with you, I can really see now what you did today."</p> <p>"Really? And what about you?"</p> <p>"I was wondering if maybe you'd want to come back with me sometime," he suggested. He really was not sure, but he really liked the idea. She liked hearing his enthusiasm, too.</p> <p>"Well, maybe we could make a date, and then when we get back home, I'll let you know."</p> <p>"Oh, that would be kind of nice," he offered.</p> <p>"No way!" she said, surprising herself with the admission. She was not going to do that. But she didn't care if he was all right with seeing her in her bra and panties.</p> <p>"I'm just saying, if you're willing, I'd like to show you the way I drive..."</p> <p>"So long as you don't mind me looking..." she laughed again.</p> <p>"I know... that's fine, but if you're wondering, you can look... all you really need to know about how long we drive..." he said. His smile had returned, revealing his serious demeanor, but her mind told her not to worry.</p> <p>"Really? That would be awesome... but maybe you'd hate to drive home in the dark..." she joked. He did not answer for a minute or so, but his smile got bigger the longer she said it. She decided it was time to test this out.</p> <p>"What do you mean?" she said, with a bit of shock - it seemed to come to her mind.</p> <p>"Why don't you go to the bathroom - take out your underwear and put them in the suitcase. Then take them and the clothes over here." She was not surprised that he was already thinking her up like that - she was used to feeling it on him. And then she quickly went into the bathroom where she turned on the shower, turning the water to a nice light. She turned it on and sat on the toilet, thinking of everything they had doneâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
