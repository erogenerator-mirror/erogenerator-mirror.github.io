Perhaps I could give you a hand with things."</p> <p>This had not gone down well. If you wanted to be the one to do it, then go for it, and I was sure that if that was all you did, you could probably manage.</p> <p>I went back to the bed and put my fingers in my mouth, giving her a little tease before I lay down in the bed and took a hold of my member, waiting for your reaction.</p> <p>You moved in close and lay down on me. There was some soft talk for a few moments and then they came out in the open.</p> <p>I decided to try and be as gentle as I could. "Are we OK?" You asked. "I...I...I guess its...that's all I'm saying...just to try and..."</p> <p>I put my arms around you, and you lay back against me, sighing softly as we lay there.</p> <p>"I don't know...um...maybe it's just going too far..,"</p> <p>I put a hand up to cover your mouth again and laughed softly. This was an act, and a joke.</p> <p>"You didn't do it..." you said softly. "I'm flattered...and I'm happy for you."</p> <p>You slid your hands down to my buttocks and drew me to you, and then you leaned down and kissed me, running your tongue around the outside of my lips and in and out, caressing my whole body.</p> <p>If you liked all this you'd have to do was ask "No", but you did not.</p> <p>Then you began to kiss more boldly, your tongue probing at my mouth. I put one hand on the bed to hold back more of your kisses, and let you do whatever you could to me, knowing that this wasn't something you would let any way you would be able to control.</p> <p>You slid one hand down my body and lifted the front of mine, until it rested on your leg, but this only served to pull me in tighter once more.</p> <p>You began to kiss my jaw and eyelids, working it gently; then you began a bit lower, kissing my face and neck, taking your time in doing just what you had been making sure of.</p> <p>Finally you put one hand on the base of my cock and began to slide it up and down, the little "purr" that I make when you stroke me causes me to lose all its hardness and sensitivity.</p> <p>I pulled away gently. "I think it's time I helped you. You might want to lay down now."</p> <p>You lay beside me and put your arm across my chest as you slid down between my legs. You stroked me for a long while before you began to work your way down across my belly and thighs. Finally you got to a knee, just a few inches away from my cock, and you began to kiss it, sucking the underside, licking the base.</p> <p>You slid a hand slowly up my shaft, using the juices on it to spread down the outside and then up through my pubic hair, where it ended in the top of my manhood.</p> <p>You were smiling up at me as you did this, and I felt my cock twitch. I closed my eyes so that I could just see what you were doing as you brought your mouth up to cover my cock and then you began to suck softly with your tongue running it around the sensitive area just behind my crown. You continued to stroke me slowly, the head of my cock going between your thumb and finger, and all I could hear was your warm and soft sucking and soft caressing noises.</p> <p>By now I was so aroused that I would have given the slightest encouragement if I could. I was so hot I could feel the veins in my penis bulging and pulsing as I waited for you to take my cock into your mouth and then I felt your mouth descend gently. I don't think I'd had a cock in my mouth in years and when you began to go down, I almost lost it until I felt the warm wetness of your mouth enveloping me, and then I realized how good it felt.</p> <p>My cock twitched as your mouth went lower, and you went to your elbows and lay down with your head on my stomach, leaving your tongue swirling around me lightly and moving your mouth up and down with your hand.</p> <p>Slowly you began to move your head lower, taking me further between your lips, until I felt the tip of your tongue running up and down my prick which felt so good. Now you began to slide up and down the underside of my cock, which felt wonderful as you moved your lips up each side.</p> <p>The sensations got stronger and faster and my cock was getting wet as you moved your lips up and downâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
