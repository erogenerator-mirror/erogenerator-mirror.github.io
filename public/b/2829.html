She climbed up on her hands and knees and crawled across the soft carpet to the bed. She reached back and spread the cheeks of her ass on the bed and leaned over it, presenting herself with her cheeks spread wide.</p> <p>"Ready?" I asked her with a big smile.</p> <p>"Uh huh," she moaned, "right here, right now."</p> <p>I climbed up into the bed with her, pushing my cock up between her legs and stroking it between the lips of her pussy. As we fucked, the only parts of our bodies visible to the living room light were the two of us between my wife's legs, and our bodies touching, but not touching. When I was really near-to the point of penetration, I pulled her ass away from the bed and got off.</p> <p>"Want more?" I asked her.</p> <p>She looked at me from between her legs, and then said, "I think we're almost ready."</p> <p>I said, "It's so hot to watch you fuck a good looking man like that while you rub your pussy all over his face. What kind of a man would he let you do that?"</p> <p>"Well, I don't know. It's not like I really want to." She sighed. "But I'm in the mood. You can watch, if you want."</p> <p>I smiled, then leaned over her. I put my head between her legs and took the head of my cock into her. I was slowly, but firmly, slipping into her tight wet pussy. The sensation of the hard ridge that my cockhead slipped into her made the hairs on the back of her neck stand out, but she didn't seem to notice. A moan escaped her lips as I gently pushed into her. She moved her hips, meeting my thrusts to push myself deeper into her, then pressed her hips back.</p> <p>Once I was in her about halfway, I paused, just feeling the sensation of her body responding to me in waves. "Does that feel nice?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes," she responded. "Oh, you feel good."</p> <p>We made the most of our time together, slowly and gently fucking. I was stroking her pussy, as we fucked, and she was moving with me on our own. The feeling I got from her and from the feeling of my cock sliding in and out of her was almost enough to make me cum, too. Just when I thought I had reached a point that I couldn't hold back any more, I felt her pussy clamp down on my cock, as her body began to shudder. I pulled out of her, and got off the bed. She rolled over and got on her hands and knees. As she did, I was standing over her, my cock sticking straight up in the air, and her pussy. She didn't look at me when I turned and got into the position. I dropped my pants and then got behind her and pushed the head of my cock into her.</p> <p>"You're gonna do it now." I whispered in her ear.</p> <p>"Ohhh. Can you do it again?" she asked me.</p> <p>"Definitely. Can I fuck you again? The way you wanted it."</p> <p>"Yes, oh God, yes! More!" She wailed as I began to stroke inside her again.</p> <p>"I said, 'Let's make this last a while. OK?' And I meant it, too. I want you to want more. Can we make it last a while, too? A while of us fucking? I don't want to make it last long, not when we've just had the best fuck of our lives. We need the rest, now."</p> <p>She moaned back to me. "OK. I want you to fuck me, then, again. And I am ready for more. Please, please, please, please, take me, make me cum with your wonderful cock. PLEASE!"</p> <p>"I'm close, I'm close." I said with as much conviction as I could muster.</p> <p>Her legs and arms were quivering under me as I pumped into her once more. "Oh, yes, yes, yes!" I heard her moan when I finally climaxed. I pulled out and lay down next to her. As she came down, I kissed her mouth and neck, then her face. She was looking at me with a dreamy kind of look.</p> <p>"I'm so glad you're doing this again!" She said in a soft voice. "When you make me cum, that'll be all I'll ever be!"</p> <p>"That's all you'll ever be," I answered. I was stroking her cheek and ear with my fingers.</p> <p>"When I'm you, I'll think anything, anything, anything that goes on," I whispered inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
