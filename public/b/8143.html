I pulled my cock from my trousers and threw away the rest of my clothes, before crawling into the shower, my back against the wall. After a moment, I heard the shower turn off. I turned to face the showerhead and watched her. She just smiled. She took off her shirt and climbed into the shower, facing me. It's almost as she did that, as soon as she got in, she was naked. She gave us both a shy wave and turned to her bag, reaching in and removing two towels, handing over her clothes. She turned around, drying her hair with the last towel, before grabbing the second towel, which was soaked, and drying a bit more, before wrapping herself in those.</p> <p>"So, you'll never see me again." I said softly, and she just laughed.</p> <p>"I promise, no matter what."</p> <p>She turned away and headed for the stairs. It took almost 30 minutes to walk down the corridor, getting home to a bottle of wine and an early start to the afternoon, after some heavy, heavy kissing. The only thing on my mind was getting me out of those wet clothes and into that shower. I grabbed a bottle of wine and an empty glass, after putting on my shoes. I grabbed my purse and the keys from her bag. I checked, again and again about where she had gone as I walked slowly to the door. She was still wet, so nothing had dripped on the way to the car. She didn't even see the door open.</p> <p>"Oh! No, I'm not." she said, "I went for a walk. It's really cold here. I came this way because I wanted to, to see what I was getting myself into." I tried to sound nonchalant but I knew I was blushing to death. "And here I thought...." she said, "....we could..." She didn't finish, so by the time I walked up to her, I knew she was already in the shower. I closed the door, got in my car and started it, then headed to the pub, knowing that she wouldn't see me. I was in no mood to be around her though.</p> <p>"Hey, honey?" the guy at the pub called from the shadows, "We're opening a beer right?" Oh shit...I just said 'no' a second before I took a mouthful and threw the empty bottle into the back seat of my van before pulling it in my face.</p> <p>The beer was open, but no one else was in it. I felt bad and embarrassed, but I was also a little horny as well, so my jeans weren't really a problem. I was only wearing my boxers. After half a dozen drinks, I pulled away to go home. I was still very tipsy, so the beers quickly left me with something to think about. Once home, I stripped down to my boxers, then went to the bathroom to piss. I heard the toilet flush, so I closed my eyes and pretended to be looking at the mirror. After a few seconds, I opened the door and peeked in. There, staring back at me was my ex-wife. She was watching me, and had obviously started to undress, while keeping pace with me in the mirror. I turned around in surprise, but she stopped.</p> <p>"Wow," she said, "you look very sexy...you look so fucking sexy." I smiled, "Thank you for the compliment." I sat back in my chair, "So, how was it?"</p> <p>"I just wanted to make you feel good while we talked about our marriage. I wanted you to know how special it is with you." I couldn't resist, "And when you told me your marriage was over, I wanted to know. I wanted to know how special it would be with you when we get back together." She was looking at my face in the mirror now, so I kept my eyes on her. She reached out and touched my shoulder, "Don't worry honey, I'll be there for you."</p> <p>"Good. I'll just stay here until after the beer, and then I'll drive you back to your place." I thought she was joking, until she leaned over and started to kiss me on the mouth. When she did, I was a little confused, but then she unbuttoned my jeans and pulled them down and off. She started to kiss me again, and this time, after several minutes of kissing her way down my body, she slowly pushed forward. Without asking, she spread my legs and dropped to the floor, taking the whole of me into her mouth. I just sat there in shock as she worked, licking, sucking and fucking me with her mouth. I was already a little wound up from the liquor, but my inhibitions were not going to be much of a barrier. I had only ever gotten blow jobsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
