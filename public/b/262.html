I'm sitting on a couch when I hear a knock at the door. It's just like most nights. I'm going to be the night.</p> <p>I open the door and there she is! I look her over. She's wearing only a short nightie and black heels. She looked so lovely standing there holding a bag. She was smiling, so warm, and so desirable. Her makeup had been light. She had obviously been looking forward to me. Her hair was pulled up into a ponytail which looked great when she was nervous. For one brief moment I was struck by how hot she looked.</p> <p>"Well, goodnight!" She said. I can't begin to describe the feeling of power I felt sitting there. I'm sure it was her as well. We smiled at one another as we left together. She stepped back slightly towards the door before shutting it. I watched her walk across the living room. Her hips were swaying back and forth with each step. I was sure I was going to have a hard time keeping my hands off of her.</p> <p>I was just about to step back when she turned around and asked, "Is there any room for another party tonight?"</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I was just getting warmed up when you called. What's it about?"</p> <p>"We're taking out. They're taking a lot of women, and we've only done some kissing on the dance floor tonight. It really isn't a lot of men."</p> <p>I almost dropped my glass of wine. "You're right. Maybe I should stop by a little later. Come on!"</p> <p>I walked her over and sat her down on the couch. For a moment our eyes met briefly again. She smiled broadly and said, "I'm sorry." I pulled my shirt over my head and dropped to my knees to pull off my pants before kneeling next to her again.</p> <p>This time I stopped at her knees and gently kissed them. "Would you like to kiss me?"</p> <p>She looked up at me and smiled. "I'd love to kiss you," she said.</p> <p>I leaned forward, placed a lingering kiss on her lips. I gently bit down on them, then licked her lips where I heard her breathing quicken slightly. I moved my lips down to her neck, then continued to her breast. I ran my tongue lightly along its edge, tracing her nipple.</p> <p>She reached up, grabbed my belt, and tore the front of my pants down. We were now down to only my boxer briefs. Her hand reached through the opening of my briefs, grabbing my cock in her grip. She stroked it firmly, then leaned forward and lowered her mouth to mine. Her lips were soft and moist. She pulled her lips back, allowing her tongue to linger in it for a moment. She pulled back again, then took over stroking me. I thought her mouth was going to devour me.</p> <p>We were now fully dressed, I was still standing, but she had already slipped my briefs down to my ankles. She kneeled again and took me in her mouth. She pulled away slowly. She repeated the motion several times, then resumed her stroking. She looked over at me and then back at my cock.</p> <p>She pulled me closer to her. My cock was in her right hand, stroking her face. A couple of times she leaned forward and sucked the head of my cock, swirling her tongue around the crown. I could feel her hand on top of mine, stroking from underneath to around and over the ridges and ridges of my shaft. I moved my hand to join hers. I found her cheek, stroking down it to touch the top of her ear. She pulled my head down again and licked the tip as she stroked again and again up and down.</p> <p>"God, that feels good!" she said. "I've wanted this for so long," she continued with just her eyes looking into mine. Her fingers had now strayed between her thighs as she stroked my shaft. Her mouth was still working on my cock, but she was moving her hand from my chest down to my balls in slow circles.</p> <p>"Don't stop." I whispered softly. She continued sucking, slowly moving her hand up and down, occasionally licking around the crown or balls.</p> <p>"I'm gonna..." I couldn't speak as her lips encircled the shaft and began to stroke in rhythm with her mouth. At the same time, my hand came into contact with her breast. She pulled my hand back slightly, then stroked it as well. She was still sucking, but her hand was beginning to move as I moved my fingers under the thinâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
