It is part of a larger problem," she continued. "I have to decide what to do about my apartment. I'm living here with my family for two years. My husband died before we got here," she paused and then added, "I want to see what I can do with the house. I don't want to do it for a month or so and then throw the place into disrepair."</p> <p>"Well, I guess I could come over to your place one weekend, about once a month. If you're free, and if your business will carry you and I don't, I'd be happy to come over."</p> <p>"Well, I might even take you up on that," she smiled. "Can I say you're a hard working man. I'll have to call for a pizza, too."</p> <p>"Well, if that isn't what you want." He grinned, looking into her eyes. "But I'm interested in the rent," he added. She smiled. "Thanks, for looking out for me."</p> <p>"Oh, sure," she laughed. "It isn't the rent that's important though. The business and my family need it more than I do."</p> <p>"I'm glad you liked my place," he said sincerely. He moved quickly away from her as she sat back on the sofa and he leaned down to kiss her. Their lips met, they kissed passionately, their desire growing. Just like the first time, this time, she made it happen. He knew instinctively that this was an opportunity, a sexual one. He wanted more to possess and be with her in a way he would never have done before. He took her hand as they kissed and held it as her hand wrapped around him. Suddenly she pulled her hand out of his grasp and she stood up, turning around. Both looked at each expectantly. He reached out to take her hand as they embraced. She slid her arms around his waist, pulling him to her. He returned the embrace and began massaging her back. She began to move her hips against his and, for a moment, he almost fell of her when she reached down and ran her fingers across his penis through his pants. She looked into his eyes and smiled as she held him tight to her. He pulled her shirt over her head and laid her back on the sofa as he kissed her neck and up to her jaw. He felt her breast press against the fabric of her bra as he continued his trek slowly up her neck. He felt her nipple harden against his lips as he kissed it and pulled the bra away from her body. She shuddered as he gently nibbled her nipple and then began his descent between her breasts.</p> <p>"I've missed your touch," she said. "I missed having you between my legs while I was working on that old man's motorcycle. It felt so good that I could feel the vibrations run down my spine." She slid one hand down from his face, past his neck, down to where her hand gripped his penis. He felt his heart skip a beat as she reached below his jeans and felt the warmth and weight of his testicles. She pulled his hardness out of his jeans and began to gently stroke along his shaft. He felt as if he was at the most precipitated orgasm he had ever experienced. She pressed her mouth against his neck again and began kissing him again as he wrapped his hand tightly around her and stroked her nipple with the back of his finger.</p> <p>"I can't wait for that cock," she whispered. "Do you fuck me now?"</p> <p>"Yes," he said again.</p> <p>"Then, you better stop, then, before you go off. I want it bad and I want it NOW!"</p> <p>He grinned. "God, but I like your dirty mouth on me!" he winked as she took his hand and put it back in her shirt.</p> <p>She pulled her shirt up and over her head, tossing it into the living room. "I'll take them off later," she purred. She leaned back on the sofa, spreading her legs to allow him access. She closed her eyes as she pulled her legs apart. When his fingers came into contact with her sex lips, she moaned as her hands moved to his shoulders as her body writhed in pleasure. She slid her heels across his back as his fingers probed and then began to trace circles around her clitoris. She closed her eyes as she writhed in pleasure again and again. He continued his exploration as she spread her legs even wider. He felt the hot wetness of her juices cover his fingers as she came yet again. She was breathing hard, her breasts heaving against the fabric of her bra and she grabbed his hand as she rode her climax.</p> <p>Finally, both of them released their breath. Still in the throes of desire, they looked at each other as they regained composure.
