John said. "I'll call the agency now to get the details. I'll need to go back to the apartment so you can check this out now." John continued to push away from me while we talked.</p> <p>"Yeah, sure." I agreed.</p> <p>We walked back to the house, with John talking to Maria, and me asking her to meet me in the parking lot of the hotel. I headed towards my room. While I was still standing on the sidewalk, I heard Maria call out to me to come in, "John! Come!"</p> <p>John came over to me, and I told him to come in and lock the door, so as not to be disturbed. He smiled, and put his hands over mine to lead me towards the elevator. As soon as I walked inside, I felt her hands on me under my shirt, running her fingers over my nipples, which I noticed were rock hard. She slowly unbuttoned my shirt, and then I leaned towards her, kissing her lips with more passion. I pulled her shirt up, baring her beautiful breasts. They were the first I ever imagined breasts to feel; small firm, and the color of a milky white. She leaned into me, caressing my chest as we kissed passionately. She then slipped her tongue deep in my mouth, and slowly moved up along my jaw, neck, and ear.</p> <p>I pulled her in for a deep kiss, while I pulled my shirt off, exposing her breasts to me. John was still standing by the elevator. I pushed John down on the couch, and began to unbutton his jeans. He looked up at me, smiling, and gave me a wink before running his hands over his shorts, making me giggle. I was in my bikini again, and it did little to hide my pussy.</p> <p>I pulled John's shorts down, revealing to him that the sight of me and Maria had turned him on, and he was rock hard. I sat down next to him, my legs brushing up against my pussy. He told me to take off my bottoms, as I undid John's shirt, pulling it off. I then began to work on John's shorts, slowly working my fingernails up and down his back.</p> <p>He looked up at me with the most incredible grin he could muster. His hand ran through my hair. Maria had taken my top off, and began to undo my strings, which gave me a chance to see John's cock hanging just above the water, almost as long as I had felt it at that moment. By the look on his face, he had no problems with what I was doing.</p> <p>After my top was off, I took the bottom off, and pulled John's underwear down, revealing to him a shaved pussy. "So glad you're here" I smiled, while continuing to work on removing John's underwear. "So I'm guessing you want to taste me?" I asked.</p> <p>John stood up as if embarrassed, but Maria took off her bottoms as well, and I could see he was a little apprehensive at first, but then he began to kneel on the couch. I then moved to him, and gently worked my hands along his shoulders, down his back and between his legs.</p> <p>John's hands were still over mine, and I was on my knees, so I moved up between his legs. I then began to kiss his neck, and then down his chest, which John quickly moved his hands to. I got up and placed the head of his cock right in front of my mouth. He immediately removed his hands from my hair, and looked up at me as I began to lick his shaft, getting it completely wet. John's eyes were closed, but I could tell he was enjoying what was happening. I then took his shaft in my mouth, moving my tongue all over it as I was doing so. John leaned back as I began to move up and down on him again, taking about half the length of my cock each time I went down.</p> <p>I took him out of my mouth, and asked John to stand up from the couch. He did so, and I leaned forwards and kissed his lips. I then took his hand again, and began to lead him into the bedroom. Just as John had done, I sat down on the couch, and put a huge pillow over my ass. I then began to do some things like rolling him out of his underwear, and licking around the tip of his cock. Then I took the head in my mouth, and began to suck his head while I was sucking on the head. I loved sucking on John, as I had always done with his girlfriend.</p> <p>"Oh, fuck, you are one good cock sucker." John softly whispered. He then reached down and began to untie my bikini bottoms. I looked over at him, and he had a look of shockâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
