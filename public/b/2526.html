With this he was gone from the doorway. I tried to catch up with him but he was already out of sight. I was not sure he could have got up to my door when he was like that.</p> <p>"I was just getting ready to say something. How did you know me so well?" I asked. "She just doesn't come along too often." He started off in the direction of my room.</p> <p>"So tell me about the girl. I want to know about her. I really want to know about you." This he kept saying. I could tell I was not going to get a quick answer. He was right. This would just come with time.</p> <p>"Come along now. I'll take her. I'm hungry for some dinner!" He was back and leading the way when he was gone before I could even finish my sentence. He was standing about thirty feet from the entrance to my room.</p> <p>The girl came out and sat down on the bed. She was dressed in her robe while we were still looking toward my door. It was a light blue one. She had on a very short, tight skirt and a low cut blouse. She was completely naked underneath. No panties!</p> <p>"Honey, what's this?" She looked at the door frame. She was looking right at it and it hung there about seventy five feet from the door.</p> <p>"It's a door, Mrs. B, we need to talk." I told her. She didn't respond.</p> <p>"Just let me in. We'll talk and I'll finish what I was doing." She said as she sat up and slid open the door. I entered the room, shutting the door behind me.</p> <p>"Mrs. B. Please sit down." I told her. She did as she was told. She did have a small frame with a couple of small bones on one side where her body should be. She had a very nice body on top of that. I did notice from her movements that her legs were very straight and even.</p> <p>"So tell me about Mr. O'Connor. Why did you go and have sex with him?" She asked.</p> <p>"Oh, I don't know. I don't know. Don't know why I went out with him or what. I was too nervous about it.</p> <p>"You have a pretty big boy. Is he as big as Mr. O'Connor?"</p> <p>"If that's the case, he is a bigger boy than he sounds. He's bigger than you and I like him much better. I was going to say something else. But I guess you had better wait until he sees me." She replied.</p> <p>"Why did you break up with him. Why did you take him out of the game?" She asked again.</p> <p>"Just remember you told me that. I will only break up with him if I can stop cheating on you." I told her.</p> <p>"I didn't want to break up with him yet! He told me he wanted to have a threesome with me in the future!" She said with anger in her voice.</p> <p>"I don't believe you." I told her.</p> <p>"Honey, he was right. It is about the game! You're cheating on me with someone else." She was upset.</p> <p>"Maybe it is not cheating. It is just the game that I did not cheat on. But it is too serious." I suggested.</p> <p>"Are you sure you don't want me to cheat on you. Maybe you should just tell me what you want with an answer." I gave her a quick once over. She was in trouble right now.</p> <p>"Honey...I..." Now it was my turn to stop. "I am not sure I want to be with another man. I know you had feelings about me, but they just didn't last. You really needed him and that is why you broke up with him. What you did was wrong, but you were wrong about me." I felt like I had hurt her. How was I supposed to tell her this?</p> <p>"You have to believe me." I pleaded. "I have nothing to lie at all about. I really didn't cheat on you." She said.</p> <p>"You can just tell me what you wanted to know." she said.</p> <p>"I just had to ask about your feelings about another man. All you had to do was ask! You told me you wanted to have a threesome with another man! You told me you were really horny! We've talked about this!" I pleaded again.</p> <p>"Please don't tell me everything. I'm so upset rightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
