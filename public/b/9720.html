And I hope you're not upset with the whole thing."</p> <p>She had to agree though. He had really hurt her now because now he looked really angry.</p> <p>"I am not upset with you. I have a lot on my mind now though. Maybe a little of it might be true," he said as he got up.</p> <p>"You aren't upset with me?" she pleaded as he walked out into the main room. "I mean...how can I say no to you right now?"</p> <p>"If you don't agree, this all falls to your head. So here's my deal. If you ever cheat on the agreement, you're out." He walked out from behind the sofa and sat down.</p> <p>Cynthia went to him and put her arms around his thighs, resting her head on his thigh. He kissed her and then sat back in the chair.</p> <p>"Well, I'm out," she smiled. "I'm really not trying to cheat on anything or anything," she said.</p> <p>"I still got my message. You sure didn't think I was angry with you," he said.</p> <p>"I wasn't. I'm not angry. It's just...it's a little weird to think I really just fucked you. Is that what you're really worried about?"</p> <p>James stood up and came to where they were sitting. He looked down at her and said, "I'm a good man. You had no reason to doubt me. You were totally faithful to me. But you got into this whole mess and I just don't believe I'm going to be the one to get you pregnant. What happened here and now makes me very afraid."</p> <p>He took the chair they were in and sat down. He looked at her like he was going to say something but then he looked at his feet instead.</p> <p>"So you really don't think you have a choice? If you do, I can just go back to being the asshole that I am."</p> <p>"Actually, I still don't think you could," she said as she put her hands on her stomach.</p> <p>"That isn't quite true," he said. "It's really more like I think that if you have a choice and you want my permission to leave here, I'm the guy that you'd have to fuck. How would you feel knowing that I'm gone and you can go find me after a night of fun?"</p> <p>"I don't get it?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, I do," he said. "I don't think we should be living in a dreary house. We're living in an empty house. And we've been living like this for a long time. We can change our whole lives back to the way they were."</p> <p>She smiled at him.</p> <p>"So what does that say?" she said.</p> <p>"Well," he said. "You can use your right arm and elbow or your left and punch the wall. You're a big, strong woman. You should be able to do that." He didn't even get up or turn around. He just grabbed the sofa arm and pulled it close to Cynthia's head, then sat down. "Get you out of here, so I don't have to fight you over this."</p> <p>He stood up and let her pull her arms free. She reached up and started to put the other arm free.</p> <p>"Wait! I want you to stay," she said. "We can get our own place without getting a lawyer." She still hadn't moved.</p> <p>James looked at her with a face full of anger. "Is that what you think I'm trying to tell you? To keep this from the public?"</p> <p>"Of course not," she sighed. "I just don't want you to walk right out of this building."</p> <p>"If you say so," he said. "Then I'll stay."</p> <p>"Then why don't you stay," she said. "We can have a new life style or two."</p> <p>"But," he started. "I haven't really gotten laid since I was fifteen."</p> <p>"It's just sex," Cynthia snapped.</p> <p>"You're just being mean. No reason for me to stay."</p> <p>"No reason."</p> <p>Cynthia stared at him. She thought back to their first night together. They had spent it making out. She couldn't imagine what more they could have had than this. She felt cheated for cheating again but at the same time, she felt loved.</p> <p>She looked up at him and saw his eyes. They were dark with anger but he was smiling at her. She tried to fight it but it was no use. He was just smiling.</p> <p>"So you're leaving already?" she asked.</p> <p>He looked down at theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
