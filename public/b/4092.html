She moans on my cock as she feels me moving to and fro. My lips graze her ear as I say. " I'm going to give you a very special show I just can't wait to put my cock in your hot dripping pussy." That got her breathing heavier and faster. She moans as she feels me move my lips from her ear to her neck causing me to take a long hard lick from her shoulder to her chin, slowly from her ear to her lips.</p> <p>The smell of her intoxicating perfume causes me to groan as I move to the other ear.</p> <p>"You should let me do that," she says as she reaches for my hand.</p> <p>"I already have," I tell her as I move to her lips. I move a hand to her breasts, she moans her approval, and I stroke her soft, full breasts causing my cock to jump and her to whimper. I moan as I slide my hand over her body stopping with my hand at her waist. I take the hint and lower myself in one easy motion. In my mind I see us kissing. I see our tongues entwine as I move in. I feel her hips pushing back into me. I feel her body go ridged as we kiss for a few moments then I move back.</p> <p>I take both hands and slowly ease the head of my cock into her. Slowly.</p> <p>"Oh god." I hear her say between moans.</p> <p>Her hands push against my skin as her body wants more.</p> <p>"God yes," I moan.</p> <p>I feel her body tighten on me, "Tell me when to speed up," I tell her as I move to the point where I can see her face. She's trying her best not to laugh, but her eyes tell me that she's not laughing. I lean down to kiss her neck as I push in.</p> <p>"Oh god." She moans.</p> <p>I feel her body's reaction to me as she starts to move her hips to and from me. I feel her body go ridged as I do the same. I hear her pant a little as I push into her. "Ohh yeah," she mutters as I push further into her body, "fuck me."</p> <p>She starts screaming. "Fuck me," she repeats over and over as I move faster.</p> <p>"Oh god," I hear her say as she moves away and sits back on the bed. As she sits she grabs my hips and pulls me back into her as I go deeper.</p> <p>"Fuck me, fuck me," she whispers as I move faster and faster, "Fuck my nasty cunt," she says quietly as she holds me tight and starts fucking back at me.</p> <p>"Oh God, yes," I gasp as the first hot spurt of myself shoots into her.</p> <p>Our two moans intermingle as the first of the waves starts pushing us toward our climax.</p> <p>"Oh god," she screams as the waves of climax take her over.</p> <p>We hold each other close to each other as the waves subside, then we look into each other's eyes.</p> <p>"I love you." I whisper as I kiss her lips and she answers back.</p> <p>"I love you tooâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
