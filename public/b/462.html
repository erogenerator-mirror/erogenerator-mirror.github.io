He said and leaned back again. His expression had been serious as all his actions were serious, I could tell from his movements that there was no other explanation, nor any other way of putting it. "She is all mine, she will do anything. She'll do it willingly."</p> <p>"Anything, is it really?" I tried to remember, and I realized that I was trying to be nonchalant.</p> <p>"I know it's very strange to have to tell the whole group that you have a new girlfriend, that you are a virgin, but I am not sure you need to be embarrassed or anything."</p> <p>I thought for a moment, and then tried to give my reaction. "Oh...really? How should I be, you guys?"</p> <p>"We are all virgins." Matt said with a smile. He picked up my beer glass and offered it to me. I accepted it and felt myself suddenly lightheaded, my mind was back on the way to orgasm and what I could do to myself when I finally made it to the bedroom.</p> <p>I followed Matt into the bedroom and sat on the side of the bed with his cock bouncing up and down between his legs. I had no idea that I could let anything be held inside of me, could I? I couldn't.</p> <p>"Take off your pants and sit with the back of your legs against the headboard." Matt ordered, he was being kind of forceful, but I knew I couldn't do anything else. I could, though. I looked to the side and saw one of our little group of friends on the bed. I knew that she was naked underneath. The look on her face as she gazed at me...I saw her body, the way her nipples poked through the soft material of her night shirt with her breasts now rising and falling as she waited, her face just barely visible on either side of her. My mind was suddenly blank, and I looked over at her and then at the ceiling.</p> <p>"She has never let you touch her, you know." He said quietly. "Just her hand."</p> <p>"That's good." I nodded and felt the beginnings of an erection. Matt leaned over and took one hand from my back, and ran it down my spine, stopping to grab a handful of my now naked ass. "Does it feel good?" He asked, his voice barely above a whisper. I could hear his voice but not hear it. I nodded. He continued.</p> <p>"You might want to tell her that when she tells you too, you better be careful, I like to hear things from somebody who is a virgin." I heard the faint sound of panting and heard his breathing increase. "See, you are enjoying it aren't you?" He let go of my ass and reached down to cup and finger my nipple. He ran his other hand up and down my sides, over the silk sheets of my negligee, down my stomach, and through my long blonde hair. I felt the softness of his hand caressing me as his other hand moved around to my back and shoulders.</p> <p>"See?" He said softly. "Don't stop me." I let him caress me for a while longer, and then he leaned over and kissed me. I could feel his breath against my lips and then I felt him tongue slide against me and then he broke our kiss and his hands moved down my sides, back up, down, back up again...and then his tongue returned to its path.</p> <p>I was lost to him, completely oblivious to anything except my naked body and the fact that I was kissing him. I hadn't realized that we were making love until he moved slightly between my legs. His hand slid down my butt and the tips of his fingers touched my pussy lips. I shuddered. His fingers pushed into me.</p> <p>I opened my mouth slightly and moved my tongue into his ear, "I don't want to stop." I whispered. "I want to do this again, I want you to feel as good as I feel now."</p> <p>His head slowly moved back down to my chest. As he kissed each of my nipples, he slowly moved one hand down my belly, between my legs...</p> <p>I reached down and pushed my hand away. "Don't touch me, please! What am I supposed to do with you, when you do that to me?"</p> <p>"Do what you will with me." His voice was very deep, almost a whisper, but still audible. I felt the movement of his hips against mine as his hand finally made it's way to my pussy.</p> <p>"I want you to fuck me right now!"</p> <p>He stopped a split second behind me, but I felt him press against me. He kissed my neck and I felt his tongue as he slid against me. His tongue was rough, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
