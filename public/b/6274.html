I could feel myself getting close to an orgasm.</p> <p>"You're getting me all wet."</p> <p>"Me too," she responded. "It's probably for real."</p> <p>"Well you should be, now."</p> <p>Her face lit up in a look of approval and delight as I continued to rub her clitoris, bringing her to a point of almost pain, just enough to keep her close to the edge. Finally she asked me to stop. I reluctantly stopped and she turned to me.</p> <p>"It's your turn now, sweet thing." She looked at me questioningly.</p> <p>"It's okay, I've been watching you masturbate and I knew I would give you a really special orgasm."</p> <p>"Do you really?" She asked with a knowing smile on her face. "Would you like to give me one?"</p> <p>"You're on your own little toy girl."</p> <p>She smiled at me. "I think I'd like that."</p> <p>We both stood then, just looking around the restaurant. I went over to the counter to pay and we kissed before walking back to our table where we had arranged. I noticed that everyone seemed to stare at us as we sat down. She reached out and touched my hand, which was still in her lap.</p> <p>"Is it okay for me to stop this?"</p> <p>She pulled my hand out of her lap and looked at me seriously. "Yes, I would like that very much and I'd love you to show me how you really do it."</p> <p>I started to unbutton her blouse. "Let me help you out of it."</p> <p>She helped me get her blouse off, and before I could do anything she reached out and unbuttoned my pants and undid my belt. I helped her pull them and my shorts down and they slipped easily down my legs as I sat there in my underwear.</p> <p>My erection popped right up as I kicked my shoes off, and she took it in her hand and started to gently stroke it. We went back to our food and she returned to her coffee and started to eat again. I sat back, feeling very relaxed and enjoying her touch.</p> <p>"I'm still kind of naked."</p> <p>"It's okay, I'm still a little uncomfortable."</p> <p>"I didn't think so."</p> <p>"No, I mean it's not that. It feels really good."</p> <p>"Good? What about you?"</p> <p>"I really love it, you know. It turns me on."</p> <p>I started to relax, then noticed that her eyes had changed. They were closed and she seemed to be getting lost in the moment, something she rarely did for me. I thought of her as a good girl, a sexy woman with a wonderful body and I thought that I could easily fall in love with her. I looked around the table at all sorts of people and their eyes kept stopping on me, and I could see them looking at me. My heart was pounding a little harder and I was having difficulty keeping my gaze on her.</p> <p>She turned to look at me, now leaning forward and kissing me softly on the lips. She pulled away and looked at me for a long time, then smiled at me.</p> <p>"You really do love me," she said.</p> <p>I smiled and ran a hand up her skirt. "Is that okay with you?"</p> <p>"Yes, I really mean it."</p> <p>I slipped my hand up her skirt and found her clitoris. "Is this okay?"</p> <p>"If you like it, I guess I can take off my panties too. Are you sure?"</p> <p>"I'd love to feel you naked again."</p> <p>We kissed and I let my hand drift a little lower, and her skirt slid up her legs as she put her hand on my shirt and felt me bare chest. She was wearing plain brown panties that had a little lace trim across the top and a matching bra that hung down over my belly as my shirt fell down to my waist. She pulled my shirt off and we kissed again, her hand moving up and feeling my back. We went back to our food and ate as she looked around the restaurant for the perfect time to ask me. By now we were both very hot and excited, and she was moving to get up on the table and sit down between me and the waitress.</p> <p>After a couple of minutes, we got our food and she was back on her heels, holding the back of the chair as I got up off of the floor. We kissed again, and she pulled my panties down and kissed me harderâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
