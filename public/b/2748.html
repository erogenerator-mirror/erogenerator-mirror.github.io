She took his hands and guided them to her breasts. He cupped them gently and held them for a while. "But this way it is very easy, I do not have to hold anything up in these for myself. If you move, I will have to move your hands and make your breasts move all around. If I don't do this for myself, I will just move your hands back." She closed her eyes and lay back on the bed. "And then I can do it all at once."</p> <p>Tom, with one hand still wrapped around her breasts, moved his hands along her sides - he could feel her heart beat rapidly. He rubbed his hands down her sides and over her hips until he reached the top. He did that the same way while lifting her hips up, leaving himself between her legs. He did not try to get her whole body into his hands, but he could move slightly more with each movement. He could feel that his hard cock was pressing against the towel under her. He had to control his breathing to not start moving her hips, but it might have been because it would be too loud. But he would try anyway. He slowly and lightly rubbed her lips and gently blew on them. She jerked up, bringing her breasts over towards him. Tom was just getting into it, enjoying this beautiful sight. He kissed her soft lips, then softly blew again on her lips. He ran his tongue around her lips, tracing them along her upper lip. His hand slipped around her back and slipped onto her ass.</p> <p>He could feel her tense up, and he felt how far she was prepared to move. She didn't want to give him the chance, but if she couldn't move then she would just turn and move back away from him. Maybe she would have to give him a chance to push her ass instead. Tom moved his hand into the top leg of her skirt and slowly eased the skirt up her leg and off again. It did not stay on much longer, but it provided some protection from the hard-on he was getting. He reached down and felt the warm, wet lips of her pussy. It felt as good as he thought it would if they were dry. His finger slid over them and started to slip inside. She gasped at his contact - no, there was no need. Her legs closed around his hands and she moved her hips up to him, trying to get him inside her.</p> <p>Tom had no intention of putting anything else on - he slid his whole body forward, sliding his hard cock into the gap between her legs - her wet, hot pussy. He had her in his arms, with her pussy pressed against his swollen, hot cock. Her legs just kept on going until he hit bottom and they both froze for a minute. His hands felt so good on her body, so warm and soft, and wet, against his cock, too. They both froze at the same moment - their mouths were almost touching and their bodies were pressed together.</p> <p>They held each other like that for a moment. Tom began to rub her clit again - he moved his hand lower and began to rub her pussy lips over and through their juices, making them wetter - both of them were soaking wet now. And they were both so turned on that neither of them could have imagined anything more than the lovemaking to begin with with. So they just let it all happen, slowly, gently, in the most intimate way possible.</p> <p>Tom reached back for the bottle of lube and began to rub them into her. He could feel her wetness and the warmth of her body as he pressed the bottle against her. He could feel that she was ready and willing, and he was ready. In response he rubbed himself harder a bit. With his other hand he slipped a finger inside her. The warmth of her body was exciting and beautiful. The sensation of her in his hands and her body pressed against him - and his cock - - and his finger in her was enough to send him over the edge.</p> <p>Tom pushed in as far as he could, as far as he could, and felt the warm, wet, silky wetness of his finger. He could feel his own juices in her. He tried to do the same with his cock, but couldn't manage that - as he felt the pressure of his own orgasm. He was not close to his own orgasm because he wanted to last, but his body was still. When Tom finally pushed in deeper and felt himself coming in her, he heard a muffled "Yes" and felt his orgasm begin inside his body. He felt light with it, as the waves of orgasmic pleasure rocked his body. He was still as he felt himself come, feeling the release spread out over him. It was one of the best orgasms he could remember.</p> <p>It was just for a minute or so, they lay there in each other's arms, their heartsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
