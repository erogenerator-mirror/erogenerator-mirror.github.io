My girlfriend called me yesterday about this guy, he's a big shot guy, he just happens to be an amateur photographer, he's gonna be shooting in a few hours. You guys are the hottest thing I've ever seen."</p> <p>"You don't know about being a photographer, do you?"</p> <p>"No, but I can do better. Can it wait until tonight?"</p> <p>After dinner, we headed outside to head back to bed and rest up for the evening. After kissing her deeply, I rolled her over on her stomach and began to caress her back and butt.</p> <p>"Please, do it again."</p> <p>"Okay, but only if you promise me you won't turn into a pumpkin."</p> <p>I rolled onto my back and continued my onslaught, caressing, fondling, and enjoying the way the day had just unfolded. I kissed her ear and whispered,</p> <p>"Do you want me to be a pumpkin for you?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Good." I kissed her cheek and whispered as I moved her toward the edge of the table. I got comfortable as she squatted in front of me. I took off my boxers and my cock juts thickly from my body and she took the head in her mouth. She rubbed me with her tongue as she sucked gently. Her hand was busy as well. I let her suck me for a few minutes before I came, moaning in satisfaction. She took her mouth off me and said,</p> <p>"This would be something new you wouldn't believe."</p> <p>"I thought you said no pictures?"</p> <p>"Not really. Maybe I didn't. I'm not exactly famous, well, I'm not famous, but nobody comes up here for me like this."</p> <p>"Really? Well, come on, I'm starving."</p> <p>I helped her with the dishes with just her bare feet. My penis was throbbing and hard. She turned around and bent over. Without missing a beat, I took her pussy in my hands and parted it for her. I took my dick and placed the head to her slit. Slowly, I placed it into her opening, I let her push. And slowly she pushed down on my dick. Once it was in almost all the way, I started to fuck her. I knew she loved it. I pushed up and down. Every so often I would slip the head up into her. She would push back and then pull it back out. As her pussy was getting used to my dick, she would moan and tell how good it felt.</p> <p>When she could take no more, she pulled herself off me and got on all fours. I took position behind her and guided my cock as its head would enter her. Her pussy was ready, but I held back the moment when I wanted to savor her virginity. After a minute or two I rammed it home with one thrust. I didn't have any hymen left. I kept pumping as she screamed that she loved it. I started to fuck her hard as her orgasm got near. She felt her pussy contract and squeeze and knew I was there. As soon as she started to cum, my dick started to shoot my seed into her. We held each other close, not wanting to let go.</p> <p>I kissed her head and whispered,</p> <p>"Damn, this was good, I don't ever want this to end. I love you."</p> <p>I got on my back and we just fell asleep in each others armsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
