He was wrong. It opened in his mind to an interior view of the neighborhood where his father lived. There were a couple of houses across from his father's, separated by a sliver of a street, and the drive was made. He walked into the kitchen and looked around. The kitchen was as grand a picture as he could remember. The windows were huge in the kitchen and it was all the windows he remembered. No doubt he was going to have to buy a house. The refrigerator had a small window open, it would be good to take a dump from, but he knew that wasn't going to be necessary.</p> <p>Before he had time to gather his nerve, he heard his mother shout, "Hey, Honey! I've got an idea!"</p> <p>They'd left him the paper, but he'd be damned if he'd ever get the man to admit to being his father. He stood there in his mother's kitchen, frozen in silence as he tried to comprehend the fact that it had the same effect on him that it had in him. She hadn't even opened the door.</p> <p>"Are you doing something on the phone?" he asked.</p> <p>"Not yet, but you know I'm going to. I'll call later today to tell you what I've decided."</p> <p>He'd been so anxious that he was nearly out of his shoes when the phone at the door rang. It startled him at first, because a second had sounded, but with just a touch of hesitation he answered it. It was his dad, and he'd called him to tell him where they'd gone. He quickly looked around to see that the entire building was a disaster zone. It looked like it'd been set up like a dump truck; he'd been on the phone for almost an hour when his mom hadn't even opened the door. He sighed and hung up the phone, walking out of his mother's room to confront whoever they said could say to bring their kids over. He could never put two in front of one another, but his heart was breaking right then. Now he wanted to make love to her, not just talk about it.</p> <p>He knocked on his mother's door, and she opened her door.</p> <p>"You're home?" she asked, looking him all over in a t-shirt and gym shorts.</p> <p>"We're just getting started there," he said, turning on his heel to go back into his room to call his father and tell him what he was doing.</p> <p>"I've got to see to the washing, but I'll let Tom in the other room," she said, opening the door and letting him inside.</p> <p>She walked to the door and, just as he could tell she was expecting him to say what he was doing on the phone, she shut the door. Her face was expressionless, just barely concealing her shock as she looked at him.</p> <p>He closed the door, and she went back to her business. When he heard the phone sound, he looked up to see her standing with her arms crossed across her chest, staring straight down at him with her arms crossed. She was still talking and he turned to walk away.</p> <p>"Wait, Honey." she said. "I know you think I was just doing this as a favor, but I've gotta go. I'll talk to you later." She turned and ran after him, leaving him standing there, speechless, unsure of whether she could go through with it.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>As the months passed, Mark didn't want to talk about it anymore. It was as if he felt something was missing in his life forever. He felt nothing for anyone, but he knew he wouldn't want to think about dating again.</p> <p>He'd heard of guys going through a phase in each other, but none he knew of really fit things like this. He couldn't imagine a life in a gay bar or an adult store where guys were the only ones who got together with them to do shit.</p> <p>He took a quick look under the sink, washed his hands and got up in a hurry and started jogging when he saw a black BMW parked in front of the house.</p> <p>"Hello, Honey! How was your day? What are you doin', I missed you!"</p> <p>Mark was wearing a t-shirt with a tee-shirt, and he felt as if he were wearing the same shirt and shirt as anyone else.</p> <p>"Nothing special this time, really," he said, turning to go back into his room. "I just have to change."</p> <p>"I don't think you want to go into the house again," he saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
