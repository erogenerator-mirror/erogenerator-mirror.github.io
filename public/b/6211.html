She nodded and stood, her body swaying, almost in rhythm to his. He was taller than her, but his eyes looked up at her. "Here?"</p> <p>"Here?" She asked, confused.</p> <p>"In here, you can see right through me." He turned to a table beside the door.</p> <p>She followed, walking as she usually did when in the house, which made for a very sexy looking sway in her step.</p> <p>He had already stripped off his shirt, which he had placed on the edge of the chair. "So, you'll join me later." He paused a beat. "I hope you don't mind, but this is your first time." He said simply.</p> <p>"I don't mind. This is what I've dreamed about since I met you."</p> <p>"Why did you do this?"</p> <p>She smiled. "I don't know why, but I had to, in a way, and this was a way to make sense of it." He smiled. "You didn't have to..."</p> <p>And with that she walked towards him, naked under her dress. "I know, I was only half way there, but this is what I've fantasized about all day." She stopped in front of him. "We can't talk about this." He pulled her against his body, pressing his lips to hers. She returned the kiss, her arms sliding around his neck, her tongue dancing. "You've got amazing lips," she sighed.</p> <p>He pulled her to him, his tongue sliding its way gently into her mouth. She responded, sucking it, her hands going over his back, her fingers stroking his smooth skin. She moaned as he moved from her lips to her neck, and nibbled and licked her ear. "Mmmm, you're so beautiful," he groaned into her ear.</p> <p>She reached one hand around the front of his body, her fingers playing lightly with the hair on his chest. "I'm glad," she breathed, and began to unbutton his shirt, her hand pulling it out of his jeans, sliding over his shirt. "I thought we could have an awesome vacation." She undid the buttons, slowly sliding her hands down to his waist.</p> <p>He groaned in pleasure at her touch, his right hand sliding down behind her back to cup her ass. It felt hard and firm under his hand, but it also felt soft and warm, like someone else. His kisses became hot and passionate again as she pulled her shirt from her body.</p> <p>Sitting back in the armchair with a soft smile he looked at her, naked from the waist up. She was just as he remembered. Her body was soft and delicate, her breasts just firm enough to bounce in time with the motion of her hips. Her skin, which covered her stomach, went almost like cotton. Her breasts were small, just enough that she could be proud of them, and her nipples stood out a good half inch. They looked so pretty, he thought. He leaned forward to give a gentle nip, the small, hard nub at the end. He circled his tongue around it and gently massaged it in a circular motion, and moved his head down to the lower curve of her belly, then to the curve of her hips.</p> <p>She moaned when he kissed her belly button, and leaned back against the armrest of the chair. His hands slowly slid up her back, taking a deep breath while he was there. He kneaded her bottom with his hands, running them over her skin, over her hip, then back up over her waist. His hands began to slide higher, under her skirt, moving slowly, almost as if afraid to go far away.</p> <p>The fabric of her underwear was very thin, but not clingy enough to hide her arousal. Her hips began to undulate a bit as he caressed her, his fingers sliding to the hem of her panties, and lifting it slowly. She closed her eyes and leaned a bit forward as his fingers touched and then stroked her.</p> <p>Her hips pushed back against his fingers in an outward motion, trying, and failing, to move them out of the way. He pressed his cock against her, but she pushed him back.</p> <p>She turned her head, "We can't..." he started before she could finish him off.</p> <p>"I'm not done yet," she whispered. "You can touch me all you want."</p> <p>He felt the soft, warm skin of her thigh slide up his leg, sliding under his, under his balls.</p> <p>She turned slightly, leaning back onto the seat, spreading her legs so that he could see the soft valley between her thighsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
