Do you hear?"</p> <p>"Sure, it's the biggest one we have in my shop."</p> <p>The sound of metal scraping metal reverberated in the shop.</p> <p>"Come on, let's get out of here."</p> <p>The men gathered the luggage up and trundled it through the shop and into the shop. They were soon back in the office and on the phone again so it was a bit while since they had been in the shop.</p> <p>"Are we getting any more women in here then you expected?" asked an older lady who was just down the hall.</p> <p>"Yes, all of us are," said Frank. "How are your outfits going?"</p> <p>"This one has a nice touch," replied the old lady, "but we really want it to last. It's the last one and I want to see you as often as possible." She laughed before adding, "We think you are going to like this dress."</p> <p>"That dress is very sexy, you know," continued Frank. "The women in the place will be jealous of it. I think our little shop has got quite a list for you."</p> <p>The older lady smiled her approval. "I like the new look. Have you seen what kind of new dress I got for them?"</p> <p>"I've been to this shop before. You like the dress I wore?" asked Frank.</p> <p>"The dress is a size too small for me. I have been in this shop twice before and the dresses are just as sexy. It's called a "Hornet." I will have to try it one day," said the older lady. "I like the idea of going out and having that much fun, while going out and I can go to dinner out in the hotel."</p> <p>"I would hope that you would do that," replied Frank.</p> <p>"Yeah, that would be fun," laughed the woman.</p> <p>Frank and the ladies got back to the dressing room and began to change. Frank made sure the other guys took up most of the change. The dresses left long red and white stripes on the white, white, and black dresses. The one short, blue dress was the one they bought, the other shorter the one they donned. They both had matching blue panties under their matching bra. They put on a pair of red satin and silk underwear and put the matching bra on. Frank and the lady walked out of the dressing room wearing their matching red satin panties. There was already a crowd to watch the show.</p> <p>The ladies had brought a small table out for the ladies and the men that they met at the entrance to the dressing room. The ladies sat down to their table. It was a very large table. A round chair, and a small stool. A mirror was on the opposite side of the mirror so that they could observe the women. The first look at what was going on in the changing room was that of the man that was sitting behind the bar. He was staring at her, too, and his eyes were glued to her behind.</p> <p>"Excuse me, ladies," said the man who was watching their exchange.</p> <p>Frank and Frank asked him which one his wife was and they could just as easily tell the answer to that question by his eyes.</p> <p>"The man in the back of the bar says, 'We are here for the ladies and only the lady. We won't be disturbed.' Of course, he does not have any way to know any more who the lady is, either."</p> <p>The two gentleman were sitting in the stool with their arms around each other waiting for this to be over. The two gentlemen said, "That is very sweet of him."</p> <p>"As you are all so nice to us, we are very generous." He said it with a smile. Then they saw the woman that was standing in back waiting for them. She was smiling and looking like the other women in the boutique but without the same lipstick that they were going as they were trying to get the dress on.</p> <p>"Are you two going to the dinner with us?" demanded Frank.</p> <p>"Yes," answered Frank. He had been getting the dress in his shop all afternoon and he knew the shop owner very well. The shop was a good size so it was just right for the men to look at.</p> <p>"We are the shop of the men. We will be your ladies that you will be looking at," Frank said. "If you are wondering what the men are looking at all we will explain. That has nothing to do with what you are wearing."</p> <p>The woman in the front booth asked, "Where does this dress fit?"</p> <p>"That is the kind of dress that we have seen and what most would wear," said Frank.</p> <p>"Why do you want a different dress?" askedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
