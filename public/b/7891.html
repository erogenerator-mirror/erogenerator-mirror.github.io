I've missed you."</p> <p>"We can do it anytime we want. In any fashion we want."</p> <p>"Well, since you insist. I just wondered what you thought."</p> <p>"I've been thinking about it too. A lot."</p> <p>"Well, you know what we'll have to do, huh?"</p> <p>"You don't have to ask me that now."</p> <p>"If you would like..."</p> <p>"What would you like?"</p> <p>"I think we just need to find out, and take it right."</p> <p>He moved over toward her and began kissing her. He loved the way she reacted to his lips and tongue. He loved the way she tasted with every breath, in all of them. He loved it too and enjoyed the way she held his head and brought him to her. It was their first time. It was a first time for lovers too.</p> <p>They stayed in bed for a long time talking. They learned a lot about each other. They enjoyed each other's presence as they shared memories of the past. It was fun and very special.</p> <p>After that, they found out about other people.</p> <p>The girls discovered about each other and discovered they loved each other. There were only two couples in their lives. They met there in college and quickly became inseparable. In spite of their best efforts, their attraction for each other was so strong it could only last a few weeks before they had made love to each other. Their first love was a one minute, one on their first date in a week and then it was back with lots of kisses and embraces. She was his teacher in high school and they were just so in love. They were like that forever.</p> <p>The couple that met them that evening wasn't on the same stage anymore. They wanted to be in the same state that they were in. It felt so right and so right for them to be together again. Both knew they wouldn't ever be apart from each other. They had a lot to learn together. At the same time.</p> <p>The first date ended and the rest of the weeks came quickly. When they came together, their eyes and hands were more than just a few moments at the start. When they were together, they were not only in love, but also in lust. Every kiss they had was magical. Sometimes while they talked or kissed, she could feel his cock growing under her leg and that usually caused her to smile. Other times she could feel him slowly grow between her legs. Sometimes they were in bed as they were after hours together.</p> <p>There were not many other times in their life where she felt that he would stay faithful to her. That was a problem. He did seem to want her more. That made him the object of her love. He had been holding out on her, wanting to keep her. The first day the couple had moved to Texas, he had made her promise to not to marry him. She had promised. It had been the beginning of a friendship, but it had ended.</p> <p>She was so tempted, but she didn't get the chance. She couldn't bring herself to say no. She didn't want to say no in a room full of people. She didn't want to go home to her husband and see that he was dead.</p> <p>The first few weeks went by quickly but for some reason, things came quick. She had come home early from work to a quiet house. She was not in any hurry. She was hungry, tired, and ready to have a wild day of sex. She had come home to learn something new.</p> <p>At first she had felt alone when she sat alone in her bedroom at work. She had wanted to find a man to share this new adventure with and she was still single so she had tried not to feel alone. But she couldn't resist the temptation, especially when she thought it was time to get herself a new lover. One which she had missed.</p> <p>She did meet a new guy over in South Florida. She had talked with him briefly and found out his name was Pete. They found out that he was a year younger than she.</p> <p>Pete had found out right before he met her and he wanted her to move in with him. She agreed.</p> <p>The next day, Pete was at work waiting for him. As soon as he saw her he walked over. "Hi, gorgeous."</p> <p>"Hi."</p> <p>He could smell the fragrance of spring and pine trees. She put her hand out to shake his. She stood her hand out, and he could feel her heartbeat. He wanted to say it again. He wanted to touch her hands. He could feel the softness of her fingers. Pete held his breath as he looked at her. He wished he could feel her lips. He wanted to hear her moan as her lips touched his.</p> <p>"Where willâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
