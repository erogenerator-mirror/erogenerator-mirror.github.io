I heard a low, masculine voice say “Here, lets get you in my car,” as he opened the rear door to the taxi. He pulled out a set of keys and handed them to me.</p> <p>“This will give you a ride home,” he said.</p> <p>I thought he was just going to take the keys, but I felt his body lean against me and his lips press against mine, but they were soon pulled away as he said “I knew you would be wild. Just let the driver park your car.”</p> <p>Well, I did get the driver to park the car, but that meant I had to follow him out onto the road where I had to drive back up the road and back down the hill.</p> <p>I was in a parking spot right in front of his house in a short drive, as if it was far from there. It was as if I had to keep running. I felt his hand on the small of my back, just under the small of my ass and he pressed it into me until I felt the tip of his cock probing my dripping, wet pussy. He kept his lips on mine as if they were going out the door – not giving me room to breathe. He was driving me wild, his lips and tongue ravishing my bottom lip, then running down it onto my tongue as he began kissing and nibbling on my neck.</p> <p>I didn’t hear the house next door – it might have been around the bend, but I felt he wasn’t leaving any light on in there – and I started to get real scared, so I ran a little faster trying to find just one light so my back wouldn’t be totally out of sight. By the time I found the light we had gotten back on – at least it was the same spot from the house at first and if it happened to be the right spot – my nerves were on fire as well as my pussy juice was pouring out of it and there was no way anyone could see what we were doing at this moment.</p> <p>I heard my husband’s voice say “Take that skirt off.” as I felt him lift me off the ground and my skirt drop to my feet, where he immediately ran to my feet and lifted it up as if I hadn’t even taken off his own. He was almost to the door of the house, where he tossed my skirt on the ground as well and then ran off to his bedroom.</p> <p>I couldn’t believe I just ran back to my car in all my nakedness, feeling his eyes on me as I ran away, and he knew I was going to be totally alone at home! Oh my God! I thought to myself, I just ran home and fucked a stranger. I thought, I just fucked a man and now he told me I could have him any time I wanted—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
