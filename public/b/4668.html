"I'm forty. This isn't some stupid thing that I'll do for sex. This is not some silly religious talk. This is a man. A man. Some big cock that will make me feel loved." My hand went to his face.</p> <p>He smiled and his fingers traced the curve of my jaw.</p> <p>"You know what a lover is, baby?" he said softly in my ear, "a lover who cares for his woman. A man who wants to love and then, as he loves and then, as he loves and then, as he loves and then, as he loves and then, as he loves and then, as he loves and then, as he loves and then, as he loves and then, as he loves and then, when he loves and then, when he loves and then, when he loves and then..."</p> <p>My voice caught as my mouth dropped to his. The words poured out of my mouth without thought while my fingertips danced over his face. My eyes were closed and I imagined we were in another town. I closed my mouth and I could feel moisture on my cheeks and on my eyes. It was my hand sliding over the wet muscle of his face. He didn't move, didn't move his lips... or his tongue, he just remained motionless.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want to do this?" he said. His voice was rough as he asked me the question.</p> <p>"It's not about being gentle, it's about being good," I whispered into his ear, "because it's about what a lover is, for a better feeling than just giving and taking everything because you care and are good in bed and for that, so that whatever you love you care. I want to make love to you."</p> <p>"All right." My lips went for a kiss.</p> <p>My body tightened as the feeling of love touched me. I pulled him to me and felt like the softest, most precious thing that I had, even knowing I'd never be like this. I wanted him to do this to me.</p> <p>"Tell me what I should do," he asked.</p> <p>"It will be hard," I said, not sure what else to say. He knew and he knew.</p> <p>"Ask," he said, as if I was an ordinary person.</p> <p>"What else should I do?" I asked, "I can't decide what to do. Should I just tell him?"</p> <p>"What else?" he said.</p> <p>"Let's do it."</p> <p>"Is this really what you want?" he looked at me intently, "Can I do this?"</p> <p>I felt the softness of his hand between me and his body. His fingers were light; they felt soft and it didn't seem to be like his skin, except in heat, and it didn't seem to be a hair on my skin. My hand began to move.</p> <p>"I want you too" I said. "I know that you don't mean that much to me, but, if I did say that to you, in fact, if I didn't want to, what could I have said?" I felt my heart pounding as I spoke and, somehow, I knew what he was holding in his hands. He moved closer to me and his lips were still against mine. Our tongues danced as we kissed. I opened my lips a little and felt the softness of his lips. He took me again a moment later.</p> <p>"This isn't something you should do with anyone," I said.</p> <p>He laughed breathily into my mouth. Our kiss had been fierce. I felt his body pressed against me and it was electrifying! My fingertips had reached down and they stroked his soft skin as he pulled back. Again I could feel the hardness of his cock and when he moved back to me, I felt that same hardness against my lower body.</p> <p>In response, I pulled his face to mine and kissed him, pressing and pressing my lips against his as we kissed and kissed and kissed. His tongue met my own and the sweetness of our kiss melted into it. I felt the first of many orgasms that year and the first of many more were coming.</p> <p>When our passion seemed to have ebbed we pulled back for air and looked into each other's eyes. We smiled as we broke contact.</p> <p>"My turn," he said. He lifted me to sit on the couch. He dropped to his knees and pulled his hands to his lips. He ran them from my ankles, back up, to the tops of my thighs. I felt one hand on the inside of my right leg and another slide up to my thigh. As the fingers brushed my pubic hair, the other hand moved to touch my mound. There was no hurry.
