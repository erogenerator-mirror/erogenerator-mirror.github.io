So far, he'd been the only one who'd said "no", so that was about right. Then he looked up and smiled, "so it would be right this time, huh? So far, so good. I think you know my name, right?"</p> <p>"Of course I do," she smiled back, trying to hide the sadness she felt. Oh God, he'll hate me forever.</p> <p>And she could only shrug his way and go back home.</p> <p>And so he sat there like a big guy, his mind wandering. He was still in the moment after everything and not sure what to think or do. He'd just never really had an opportunity to have a conversation with a woman like this. He'd just been so damn busy, all day. After all, she was a beautiful, classy, attractive woman in all of her pretty, glamorous glory. If she looked good today, she had to be damn good, too, he thought, he just hadn't had the chance.</p> <p>"How could you say no?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don't say yes of course, but it's not because you didn't want things done," he smiled, "not really. But for the next hour, I thought about you a lot."</p> <p>Liz turned her head and looked up into his eyes and blushed.</p> <p>"I'm sorry. I guess I'm not used to being this way to begin with," she smiled weakly, "but I guess that's part of the way I've always been made."</p> <p>"You've got a way with words, Liz," he said, his voice not really taking the sting out of his comment, "because you never had that in your life."</p> <p>She bit back a laugh that she hadn't intended and looked down.</p> <p>He could feel himself go weak in the knees and it was a strange emotion. It started with a little laugh in his belly, just a little laugh.</p> <p>"Liz," he said again, with a little more confidence in his voice, "I have feelings for you."</p> <p>Liz looked at him quizzically and then back up at his eyes.</p> <p>"What do you say?" he asked.</p> <p>"You don't have to, Tom."</p> <p>"Yes, sweetheart, I can say that," he smiled, "although the way we came to this together can change both of us a lot. And if it is good for you, then it better for me, too. I'm willing to be with you for as long as you are willing."</p> <p>She didn't hesitate and said she wasn't sure about this, but she'd do whatever it was that she said. And she told him she'd come back for more, if that was what he'd like, and he liked that idea so much.</p> <p>"No," he answered, "I don't think we'll get to that soon. It's only fair, sweetheart, that you find out something you want."</p> <p>Liz thought for a few seconds and then took a step back. Tom was looking down at her like he couldn't believe what he was seeing.</p> <p>"So," she continued, "do you, Tom?"</p> <p>"Yes," he said, a little nervous. So it was up to her. She did not hesitate to take the risk, though. Her eyes lit up like a beacon, so intense that they almost looked to be shining. She knew that he was probably looking at her in a way that he was trying to find the path that she was looking for, one that she could follow.</p> <p>That was exactly what she was looking for. It was what would make her a good candidate for his company. She'd spent much of their relationship as the "young lady in the blue" type who was always around. She'd never really spent that much time as a date, but she'd also never really been able to keep up what a "young lady" was like before she'd met him.</p> <p>"So, the offer?" she asked, giving what she hoped was a challenging look, "is," she paused, "are we talking about an extended relationship?"</p> <p>"No way, Liz," he said, a little breathlessly, looking up, "It's just you," he added as he shrugged and tried to look down at her again, "and me."</p> <p>She smiled and she knew that he was going to take it as a dare, as soon as she got there. She'd even been willing to risk it, and though she was nervous about what she'd tell him, sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
