I knew we were right. I could feel his heavy sack swinging against my crotch. He lifted off me slowly. Before he plunged my body, I put my legs on his shoulders, feeling his weight press against me. I spread my legs and he went deeper, pulling back just a little, pushing in again, pushing the crown past the resistance...and he knew what to do. He slowly pushed in and I gasped. I pushed back against him, feeling our pubic bones grind together. It felt so good, the feeling of fullness, I don't know how long we held on to each other before he finally got the full length of it. He pressed in just a little harder and deeper, deeper still, until his pubes met every other inch, our pubes met each other, and we were both gasping for breath again. He held on to me, we had to hold onto each other.</p> <p>I felt so very full! My insides pulsed in his arms as he pounded me in rhythmic thrusts, I could feel his weight as he was moving in and out of me, but the sensation of his rigid meat inside was nothing like the feeling inside me, or the last time, with my husband. I leaned forward, resting my head on his broad chest.</p> <p>"So good," I whispered. We lay there for a minute, basking in the feeling and closeness of the moment, until I said, "Are you staying?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I think so. But we won't be far yet." He pulled out of me, rolling toward the edge of the bed. I pushed back and his softness made me shiver when he lifted my body and lay with me, pulling me close again, rubbing my chest and neck and shoulders and then down the line of my neck and shoulders, making me quiver with longing as I pulled his shirt off. "No, not yet," I said. He rubbed my stomach and I spread my legs and we touched lips and he rolled over onto his back on the bed.</p> <p>I straddled his hips, feeling the weight of the rigid cock beneath me as I slid over it, the thickness in my vagina spreading me like a thick warm cushion. It twitched as I slid down a little, feeling his soft pubes against me, rubbing the inside of my thighs. When I got back around to straddle his face, he began to rub my clitoris. "Oh, Jesus!" I whispered, as he licked. It felt so good to feel him lick me there! It was all I could do to hold my breath as his fingers dipped inside me again. I kept going down on him and his tongue never stopped working, licking, licking, plunging between mine.</p> <p>It couldn't last too long, or maybe it didn't, since he was thrusting up into my cunt faster and faster, and finally, he erupted inside, his cock swelling for release once more, pushing against my clitoris as he flooded me with his seed. He had to have been holding onto a condom, I realized, but just for a minute. I sat as he rolled over on top of me, our legs rubbing together again and again, and, when I opened my mouth, he was still inside me. One last squeeze of his cock and a few minutes later we were on his bed again, his arms around me, cuddling, kissing and rubbing. He was a sweet gentle lover, and when we eventually finished rolling apart and laying there on the bed, he kissed me and said, "I'm so glad you came along, too." I giggled and added, "I think we have a great relationshipâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
