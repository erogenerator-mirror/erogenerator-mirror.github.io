Is there any more?"</p> <p>"Oh yes, please let me give you a kiss."</p> <p>Cindy and I made light conversation for a few moments before Cindy got up and took my hand and put my hand on the front of her dress. I felt her boobs move and her nipples were erect. We finished talking and Cindy had pulled Linda for a kiss and she looked at her and said, "Would you like to try?"</p> <p>Linda looked at me and I said, "You're not getting anywhere else, do you know her?"</p> <p>Linda said, "That's okay. I feel a little bad for her, but we can always be a little wild."</p> <p>I looked at Cindy and she said, "If she was my girlfriend, would you love to do this with me?"</p> <p>I nodded.</p> <p>Linda looked at me again and said, "You're right as well. She'd love to be a fly on the walls. My sister is the best."</p> <p>"Well you have no excuse to be an ass about this."</p> <p>"I already told you, it's all a game, and I don't want to lose."</p> <p>Linda said, "Okay. If you promise to do anything that I say, I promise to put my feet up in the air and you can kiss my foot as you wish. Anyplace."</p> <p>Cindy got up and said, "I don't think that's a good idea. Besides, I would have liked to lick her pussy too. That way I can tell if your boyfriend did too."</p> <p>It was then I saw Linda raise her skirt and pull her panties to the side and said. "Linda, I think you're already wet."</p> <p>She said, "I'm so wet it hurts. I hope you don't mind me using my foot."</p> <p>Cindy was sitting on the back seat of the car, still looking at me as she stood in front of me with her feet up in the air. She started the car and said, "I'll rub my feet together. You just sit there and let me do the rest."</p> <p>"This might be fun." But then she looked at me and said, "You know, I was thinking the same thing!"</p> <p>"What? Are you sure?" My erection was making me nervous. It was starting to tent my underwear, which was now soaked and wet with Linda's pussy juice.</p> <p>"Okay, but do you see me naked?"</p> <p>"Yes, I know. Come on, open your legs so I could see how excited you are by my bare feet."</p> <p>Linda pulled a chair closer to Cindy and asked, "Okay, would you do that for me?"</p> <p>My wife was standing right in front of me and I had trouble seeing what was going on.</p> <p>Linda said, "I'll rub my feet on yours and play with the tip of your dick and make it go soft." She lifted a leg and put it on the arm rest of the big chair and sat back, spread her legs, and said, "Stroke that dick."</p> <p>Linda leaned over and started stroking my dick, looking me directly in the eyes as her hand slowly jerked up and down. I knew I couldn't hold it much longer and I was getting close.</p> <p>"Okay, now I'll put my feet up under that chair." Linda said, "Please let me rub my feet on your dick until you shoot all you've got in there."</p> <p>I couldn't hold it much longer and I shot a load, splashing against the dashboard.</p> <p>Linda stood up and said, "That worked too." and went back to the front of the car. I saw the red lights on the rear fender. She walked a little way.</p> <p>Linda got into the front passenger seat and said, "I'm glad that my husband had a beer before we left. Do you want a beer?"</p> <p>"No thank you. I think you just needed one."</p> <p>I took Cindy in my arms and hugged her. She leaned in and kissed me. Before she could turn I moved my mouth forward and kissed her neck from behind. That elicited a shiver which seemed to be from my wife.</p> <p>"Mmm, that felt good".</p> <p>Linda said, "What was that?"</p> <p>"Your nipples are hard. They were right on my chest just before your eyes rolled in my head. That's how they feel when you're excited."</p> <p>"Did I do that?"</p> <p>"Yes, yes you did".</p> <p>I released her for a second so we could get back on the roadâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
