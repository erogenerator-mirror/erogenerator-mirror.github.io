He was back. She felt the zipper being lowered and the tip of something being pressed into the crevice of her ass. The feeling was electric. She could feel herself opening, and taking his organ in. His hands reached around and squeezed either cheek, and she was glad for how long this was taking for him too. He was back inside her. The sound of the zip opening and one of his hands holding her waist pulled her more into him as he thrust into her, and both of them fell on to the bed.</p> <p>She could feel each motion inside her ass through the nylon of his shoes. She could hear his breathing and heard the noises his cock made. He was still fucking her, and she could sense every motion of his cock. It was slow like a man before a long piece of steel. She could actually feel every ridge of that marvelous cock inside. She could feel it sliding down inside her, as if he was going in and out of her. She was so deep inside that she could feel his balls against her clit.</p> <p>What had begun a slow, rhythmic fucking wasn't slow at all. It was an impulsive fuck, and he was fucking her as if it was a regular cock. It was slow and deliberate at first. There was no need to rush into the wild, wild fuck. It didn't take more than a few minutes to take over her body. He had her going, and just as she was heading for her orgasm, his pace slowed. His movements were shorter, and he was leaning forward against her body, still stroking her clit. She could feel his lips kissing her ear. His lips were soft against her skin. She could do so not know what it would feel like if she opened her legs and wrapped them around his hips and wrapped them around him. His cock had gone far inside her, and seemed to be moving her body in time with its own needs. Maybe it had been just the way he liked it when they were going to fuck. They were making love, but they weren't making love. It was more like a two body fuck, with a man's penis inside her ass instead of another man's cock in her hot, wet pussy. She knew it, she knew what it felt like, but she was still surprised at what was happening. He had been in her ass and in her pussy. She had never been fucked by an object.</p> <p>They weren't making love anymore. He was fucking her in her ass. But she couldn't be sure. His cock had remained buried inside her as her climax washed over her body. He was fucking her, and not in her ass, it was in her pussy, not in her mouth, not in her mouth. She was taking every inch of his cock into her pussy and in her asshole again and again, and in and out. Now that he was not a man, who had cum inside her, he was having fun, and he loved fucking her. Again and again, and the sensations were as intense as they had been before. She found her breathing becoming shorter. He could tell. He'd let her relax in this position, and didn't want either of them to move too soon. He had enjoyed fucking her. His fingers kept fucking her pussy as she climaxed. He hadn't felt that way in years. He was beginning to feel that way again.</p> <p>She was on the verge of coming again, and as soon as he knew it, he pulled out, not wanting to come in between her ass and pussy. She could feel the emptiness, and he moved forward and pushed the tip of his cock into her asshole. She reached around and squeezed her pussy muscles back as he started pushing, pushing all of himself into her ass. His cock pushed against the tightness of her anus. It began to hurt. She felt it push in as close to her body as she could take it. It was so big. It had seemed huge in her mouth before, but this was so much bigger. A sharp slap to her left butt cheek. She pushed back at him, as much as it was possible to keep pushing, and it kept coming in. It was huge. It was too big to feel so good around. The pain in her ass got sharper.</p> <p>"Ahem... I guess... you've learned very well!" Mark was smiling.</p> <p>She looked around at him. She was staring at the ceiling, but no one else was paying attention to them. The noise of his cock coming out of her ass slowly became louder and louder. Now this was what a man felt like when he was fucking her or she'd been with someone else. They were both moaning by now. Finally her orgasm was over. She felt numbness in her body. It hadn't been that deep, but it was enough. She opened her eyes and looked around. There was no other choice. She feltâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
