I began to moan...she stopped with one hand at my hip, and moved away from my body...</p> <p>"You are mine..." was all she said.</p> <p>I stood up now... she reached for my hard cock and began stroking it... she knew I loved being watched, I began to moan as she worked my cock...</p> <p>It didn't take long till I was as hard as an iron bar.</p> <p>"Lay down", she commanded.</p> <p>I laid down on the bed, and waited with just my head resting on the soft soft pillows...her tongue was running all round my lips and then across to my other cheek as she kissed this spot...the sensation was more than I could stand...</p> <p>She moved herself around so she was sitting on the edge of the bed, and then she began to move across my body...her head slowly moved across my body... She began to kiss my chest and stomach and then my stomach...moving upwards to my groin.</p> <p>It didn't take long till my shaft was completely stiff again... I could feel her hand sliding up and down the shaft as she cupped it in her hand... I could feel it moving in her hand as it slid back and forth...she looked me in the eyes as she continued to stroke it, and then I could feel her lips move down and take my cock into her warm, wet mouth...</p> <p>She moved up and down on my shaft several times over the next several minutes... my moans grew louder...I felt her take a deep breath as my hips lifted off the bed, and my hands were going all over her ass...I could feel my balls begin to tighten as she began to tighten with each stroke...my hands were clutching the sheets of the bed as I lifted the rest of the way up onto my toes...</p> <p>Just as I was going to tell her to stop, I was greeted with her mouth on my cock...the sensation of it going deeper...my groans grew louder, and soon I was going through the roof...the heat from her mouth and the tightness around it became unbearable...her hands gripped the sheet as her head flew back and forth with each stroke.</p> <p>I was getting harder and harder in her mouth...it was driving me crazy. She knew it and she kept it up...moving faster, and harder...and that's when I felt the first surge through my toes...I'm not sure her throat even seemed to have closed when it was opened...it was huge!</p> <p>I grabbed her by the hair and began to force it up and down. Her eyes were wide in surprise and yet she didn't seem to notice. But I was lost in a sea of sensations and I was lost in them... the softest tongue on my shaft, the sweetest mouth working it.</p> <p>I felt my balls tighten once more and I knew I was going to let go any time....I held and squeezed...I wanted to fuck away until this was over...</p> <p>I looked down to see her eyes roll back and her whole body shake as she swallowed every drop.</p> <p>She looked up at me and smiled, "Wow, you're even more turned on than I thought"</p> <p>"I love to be watched, and to cum."</p> <p>"You're not in a fair way," she said.</p> <p>"You don't have to worry about it, because I'm really in the mood."</p> <p>"Oh, I want to be watched, too."</p> <p>I kissed the side of her neck and trailed my hands down to her breasts...I couldn't wait to see them bouncing in the air. I had never touched a breast for real and I loved to feel their shape...It only took a minute or so to realize that both nipples were hard as rocks, and I wanted to suck them...</p> <p>I grabbed both of her nipples and began to gently knead and pull them...</p> <p>"Are you sure you don't mind, it makes a big difference to me how big it is?"</p> <p>"I just knew you would love it...I love to feel your mouth on my breasts."</p> <p>"There's no hurry. I want to play with them, too. Would you like for me to do that to you?"</p> <p>Her hands were reaching across the bed to my shoulders. I could feel her fingers inching to his pants as she rubbed herself and moved towards his hard cock. "It's your turn to make up your mind" as she reached for him... I watched her move around on the bed, pulling her panties down her leg as she lay on her back. I watched as she lifted her legs one at a time and pulled them to her chest, allowing him to slip it off. My mouth was watering to see her sexy body inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
