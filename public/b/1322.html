We can't just walk out this door."</p> <p>"Then we need to call in the first aid unit, and help her to get out of the hospital. Then we'll stay in touch, and work something out."</p> <p>"You already told me she's been to the top medical school. She should be a doctor. And besides, this won't seem too crazy. She might even like it. She might even like you."</p> <p>Sam's head snapped to his in shock, and then he felt someone's hand slide up his chest and over his pecs. He looked up to see Laura's expression, and in the instant that he saw that she was staring down at him, he felt like he was made of glass.</p> <p>Her lips brushed his ear and she whispered as her lips brushed it. "Honey? I just realized something. This girl really is good. I can't help but think she might be a good nurse, and you wouldn't like to be alone."</p> <p>Before Sam could comprehend what she'd been feeling, she was gone. He felt his chest tighten and he sat back on the couch, his hands sliding up the small of his back to gently squeeze. He watched Sam as he tried to gain some sort of composure, as the thought of Laura had been so far out of his experience back to back, it seemed like a little too long ago. "So, what do you do? I wouldn't take care of you if I was you? Not really. I've got a whole lot of work to do there to get you healthy, and I thought I'd be able to help, but I see how you're reacting. I think you might be an amazing nurse, but sometimes you just have to let go and enjoy yourself."</p> <p>Laura came back in, carrying a set of clothes she had retrieved from the back. She smiled sweetly at him, then took off her blouse as Sam sat there, unable to help himself. As he watched, she unbuttoned the buttons of her jeans as she pulled his shirt out of his pants, and then slid out of his shoes. The socks she was wearing were also taken off so that he was finally able to remove them.</p> <p>"Now you've got all kinds of work to complete," she said, moving to sit next to him on the couch. "And you don't have to go out of your way to help any of us. The medical people already know I'll be taking care of you. They've even done a preliminary scan on all your other injuries. Just make it about twenty-four hours. So if you want me to keep working on you, I'll just have to come in now. I can tell you're gonna get really, really, tired, but once you're on the mend, then you're all mine. I'm going to be your nurse, honey. And once you're back in the hospital, I'll work from home to give you a home run."</p> <p>The moment was broken by the snap of fingers. Laura slid under the table and started unbuckling Sam's pants. When she started, he felt like he'd been turned to mush, with the look of relief that seemed to radiate from his face. Her hands slid in, and undid his belt, sliding it down around him and then the button of his jeans. As Sam's cock sprung out, Laura grabbed it with a couple of fingers, and started moving her hand up and down. "H-h-hat...H-oh..." Sam moaned as Laura worked him into her hand. "I can't... Oh my..." He looked down at the scene, and began getting a little uncomfortable. "It hurts, Laura. What's wrong?"</p> <p>Laura took pity on him, and gently undid his pants, sliding them to the floor. Then she reached under the table, finding his cock in her hands, and gently moved her hand up and down. "You know we've got about twenty minutes. Just relax, and let yourself go. I'm going to be your nurse. Just relax and just enjoy it in what is now your home world. Don't worry about it. Just enjoy it."</p> <p>She stood up, and kissed him on the cheek as his hands slid up her sides. She smiled as he stroked the curves of her hips, and then began lifting her shirt off of her as he slid her pants down. When she had thrown it to the floor, she reached around, unfasten her bra strap, and slid it off. Her breasts, they felt as amazing as they looked, and her nipples got so hard they almost hurt. Her hand went down between her legs, and he couldn't help but touch them on their way to the floor, and watch her every movement. Laura's lips parted, and she moaned gently as she tasted every movement of Sam's handsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
