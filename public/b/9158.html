I sat down on the edge of it, and felt her hand reach over and begin stroking my upper arm and the tip of my breast. She rubbed her hand all over my chest and arms and then she slid her hand around my ribs to lightly rub my stomach. "Let me give you a massage that won't be too uncomfortable."</p> <p>I started to protest, but she quickly got up and started undressing. I felt my own breasts bouncing as she started to caress my breasts, pinching and rolling them as she pinched my nipples between her thumb and forefingers. Her fingers slowly slid down over my stomach to the hem of my shorts, and her finger slid down my thigh and between my legs and her fingers touched my clit and her finger slid all but a few inches up my hot slit before she stopped rubbing my clit and she looked down at me. "I think it's time we get you more comfortable."</p> <p>I sat up, and my hands slid around her shoulders and she leaned close as she turned her back so that I could massage her shoulders with my thumbs and she moved her arm around to my back and started to slide me back down beside her. I rolled around so that I was sitting on the edge of the bed as she leaned back against my breast and started to run her hands all over me. I could feel her breasts pressing against me and when she moved my upper arm she lifted one leg and slid it down the bed and over the end. I couldn't believe this was happening, but my inhibitions disappeared when she reached up from under my body and ran her hand down my stomach to my thighs. She slowly slid her hand along the inside of my thighs and began to stroke my lower lips. I opened up to her hand and she ran her fingers up and down my slit and then she ran into my hole and felt her own heat through her finger as she continued to pleasure herself with one hand and explore my body by running her finger around my clit, slowly pulling it all the way out before sliding it back in and pressing against my clit again. My body started to shake and I couldn't believe it. "That's it, that's right." She whispered.</p> <p>She ran her finger down me again, over my slit and then slipped it to my ass. I jumped involuntarily, and I knew she could feel how wet I was in fact. She slid her finger into my ass and I closed my eyes so I could feel her finger and see everything in the mirror in front of me. She slipped her finger out of my hole and slowly ran her finger around the outside and over the puckered skin. I felt my body relax as her finger slipped into me. It felt fantastic. She slid her finger even farther into me when she slid it out again, and again she slid a finger back into me and this time her finger was deeper inside me.</p> <p>Her finger was very large, and the feeling of her hand inside me made me ache, and she slid in and out slowly, as she slipped her finger out completely. Then she slid a finger in my pussy, and I felt her warm palm on my clit as her finger touched me. Slowly she slid it in and out and it didn't take long before I was moaning again and her finger was sliding in and out faster and faster. She leaned close to me and whispered. "Are you enjoying yourself?"</p> <p>I could barely respond, but her question let me know that she was sincere.</p> <p>She slid her fingers out of me and then her finger came around so my body was on display for her. "Are you ready to be pleasured?" Her question came out as a command. I nodded and she leaned forward again and slid her hand down and began to rub my clit. It felt awesome, and I couldn't wait until it was over. It felt so good that I grabbed her ass and pulled her body tight against me. She put her mouth to mine and said in a quiet voice. "I'm going to love using you again and in a long time. Is that okay?"</p> <p>I was moaning again as she rubbed me and nodded. "Are you ready for more?"</p> <p>I opened my eyes a bit and said. "I'll think about it."</p> <p>She slid her hands back to my ass and gently began to slide her finger in and out and then she had my ass move slightly upwards so it was almost in her mouth. "I want you to enjoy this experience as much as I enjoy using you." She was telling me as she slid her tongue slowly and deeply inside my mouth. "It's time your first time did it with others." I could feel her finger pushing against my assâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
