I asked.</p> <p>"You want a chance?"</p> <p>"More than ever. I've been waiting for over four years for the chance to do that."</p> <p>"That's wonderful, but can I have the chance?"</p> <p>"I want the chance too and if you can't, the offer's still open."</p> <p>"I can't!"</p> <p>"OK! I'll let you out if you want to make something of it."</p> <p>"The offer's still open!" she said, "but it's a nice way of saying, please don't break it off."</p> <p>"I'll be home tomorrow. I'll try not to make any more promises. I'm sorry I broke a little."</p> <p>"That's ok. I just wanted to tell you how much I loved you!" She was really crying. I kissed her again a little longer than the evening before, then kissed her again as we separated for the day.</p> <p>The next day was Sunday. As was our habit, I called and asked him if I could meet him for lunch after work, then pick her up at the bank when he picked me up, then on to go to the bank to pick her up. The plan was to meet for lunch on a Wednesday evening.</p> <p>Friday afternoon had started out like any other day; going to the bank, then going back to the house where we'd met the night before. As she left her car at his parents' place by the back door we shared a kiss, hand in hand, and then he headed out to meet me.</p> <p>When we got into my car I thought he was going to throw me down or doggy style and fuck the day away, but instead he took her into the house again.</p> <p>We were both hot and horny after sitting in the car together about 90 minutes. I pulled her into my bedroom and pushed her face up against my wall.</p> <p>"God, I don't want to be any longer than I need to be. You make me feel like I'm back inside myself!"</p> <p>"We'll try, but don't worry, I'll get my dick sucked and you can have your sweet ass."</p> <p>Then I stood behind her and slid my cock inside her hot wet pussy.</p> <p>"Ohhhh yesssss!"</p> <p>She wrapped her arms and legs around me in a tight hug, pulling me deeper into her than any man ever had.</p> <p>Pulling out slowly I reached a hand down her back to feel her round ass. Then I began to fuck her again.</p> <p>"Fuck me harder, harder!" Her cries of pleasure made me feel powerful, but felt as though she were in love with me. She was the one that was just happy.</p> <p>We fucked like that till she almost blacked out. I could feel her body trembling with each release of come.</p> <p>I pulled her off me, turned her around and had her climb on top of me. She guided my now hard dick back inside.</p> <p>She leaned back and fucked me as she did that. "It feels so good!" She said as she continued on me, then said, "I love to feel you inside." Then she added, "but don't come inside me!" And she slipped a finger in her ass, "I told you I'd do this!" Then she pushed them both in and licked her tongue all around and around them, then she said, "Fuck me harder..."</p> <p>Then she went all the way on top and did a few more thrusts. "Oh damn!" Then she got to the other side and licked her own juice from there. Then she looked me in the eye and said, "I want to come with you!"</p> <p>I reached one arm around her back, slid her toward me under the bed and in front of her ass, so that I could pull her up to one end. As she sat I helped her onto my lap, then got the dildo she had worn for me, and pushed it slowly into her sopping pussy. "Oh yes!" she said. She had just about time it to start again before she went off again, then she just rocked, and we kissed again. We didn't talk but we kissed and we fucked until she went off again and I knew I'd come again. I got dressed, went to her and she said, "I want another chance. It's not my honeymoon night. It's ours."</p> <p>As Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
