Then I looked up and saw her smile as I leaned down and started licking her sweet pussy lips. I ran my tongue right up her slit and she started to moan. My cock was rock hard again and I started to slowly slide my cock toward her hot, wet, pussy while I continued to lick her, licking up and down her thighs.</p> <p>Finally, my tongue got to her clit and began to tongue it. My tongue then moved inward, licking it up and down, then I slipped one finger into her pussy while continuing to lick her clit. It drove her crazy. "Oh, God, David, your tongue feels so good."</p> <p>I moved to her clit and sucked it into my mouth and began to move my finger in and out of her pussy while I continued to lick her pussy. As she moved her hips, I slid my finger slowly further into her body as I worked her pussy with my other hand.</p> <p>She was moaning continuously now and I felt a familiar pressure in her pussy, which told me she was getting close to an orgasm. I kept moving my finger slowly in and out while I moved my other hand to her clit. I began to press two of my fingers into her with some additional thrusting.</p> <p>As I knew she wanted, she would come as soon as I touched her clit, so I had to change my tactics. After a few minutes of this I slid my fingers around her pussy lips and up to her clit, massaging it. I did this a few times, alternating with my tongue as I slid in and out of her pussy. She was moaning continuously and I thought she was going to come almost any second.</p> <p>Suddenly, she reached down and spread her pussy lips for me. I smiled knowing she was ready for some more sexual attention and I was happy to oblige. I was about to thrust my fingers into her when she started to come, then she reached down and grabbed my cock.</p> <p>"Oh sweetie, fuck me now," she begged me. I started to slowly move my fingers in and out of her and she started to fuck my fingers as I moved my other hand from her clit.</p> <p>As she came, she began to moan while she held onto my finger. Then she moved and took hold of my cock as she slowly positioned it at the opening to her pussy. She smiled as she felt the head of my cock pressing against her opening.</p> <p>"Put it in slowly, please," she breathed. When I knew it was the right thing to do, I pushed inside of her and she slowly sat down on my cock, which was bigger than its normal half-inch thickness. Then, we kissed once more and this time she slid her pussy up and down my cock, causing it to move in and out of her. It was a wonderful feeling. She started slowly, moving her hips up and down, then she began to move up and down faster, which caused waves of pleasure to run through her entire body. "It feels like we've been lovers forever. You are the most beautiful lover I know."</p> <p>Before long, she was getting louder and moaning, "Yes, David, fuck me. Oh my God, yes. I want you to make love to me. Oh, yes, you have to make love to me. Fuck me David. Fuck me. Oh, you are so beautiful. I can't have any more love in me."</p> <p>My hands were on her firm ass and I began to move her in circles until we had an explosive rhythm. She wasn't about to break the speed of our motions. I kept fucking her, as she began to move, bucking her hips back at me and saying, "Yes, David, that's it. Fill me up, darling. I want more."</p> <p>Our tempo increased and then I was screaming and she was bucking hard for me, while she was crying for me. At the same time, I had another orgasm and she let out a scream again. At the same time, both of us began feeling weak, so we broke our rhythm and collapsed on the couch.</p> <p>We continued for a few more minutes, kissing each other and saying little things. Finally, she raised herself off me and we showered together. As we were washing each other, she asked, "So, are you going to take me to bed?"</p> <p>I replied, "Yes. I guess we'll see."</p> <p>We did and I said, "So, you want to give me a blowjob?"</p> <p>"Yes, I want you to go down on me and make me come while you lick my pussy." Before we knew it, we were both asleep, but we did talk about itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
