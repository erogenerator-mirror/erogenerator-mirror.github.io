I brought a glass of wine from the fridge. I handed it to him, then sat on his lap. We kissed once more, deeply and passionately. He ran his hands up my smooth legs, touching my skin with so much sensuality. I moaned at the feeling of his hand brushing against my soft, silky thighs. We talked about sex much more freely than is a normal conversationalist would. He took the glass of champagne from my hand then leaned up to kiss me once again.</p> <p>He wrapped his strong arms around me, then lifted me up, carrying me to the bedroom. I pushed away from him, my body trembling with anticipation. I placed my hands on his chest, stroking him, feeling the firmness beneath my fingertips. I pushed him back onto my soft couch, and slowly pulled off my dress. I was not wearing panties and my pussy lips were already moist. Before he undressed me completely, we both lay there on the couch, enjoying the intense feeling of our bodies on the soft leather.</p> <p>"Let's go to my bed," I begged, looking up at him. I undid his pants and slowly stood. I unbuttoned his pants and pulled them off slowly. I ran my hands over his soft cock, making it twitch. I looked him in the eye, wanting to make love to him and see how he would respond. I lowered his pants and reached forward to kiss him again, not letting his cock escape my lips. I gently pushed his lips aside with my hands. I looked into his eyes, and said, "Take my hand and slowly, slowly climb on top of me."</p> <p>He looked at me and said, "You are a very beautiful woman."</p> <p>I giggled then reached down to lift his shirt off, then reached behind him to unzip his pants. Soon, as we were both naked on my bed, I gently pressed my lips to his. He moaned when our lips met and he slowly pulled me to him. I could feel the heat of our bodies on each other and I began to rock my body against him. I caressed his beautiful chest, running my fingers through the sparse fur and teasing his nipples with my nails. I slid up so that I could rub my clit against his hardness.</p> <p>Suddenly, he pulled back from the kiss, and said, "I have to stop. It is my turn to surprise you."</p> <p>He climbed on top of me, rubbing his cock between my legs, teasing me with it. Then I felt his soft cock pushing against me once more. I spread my legs open for him as he lowered himself down on top of me. Now I could feel the heat of my pussy against the soft skin of his body. I felt his cock against mine and he slowly began to run his hands over my body, down my back to my ass, then up to caress my breasts. I closed my eyes to enjoy his touch. I could now feel how hard his cock was getting. I pressed my pussy harder against his body as I felt it pressing against his stomach. I then felt him pull his cock away and then felt him run his shaft across my pussy lips, rubbing his cock up and down, sliding across my wetness. Then he began to slide himself up and down between my wet lips, making me want to feel him fill my body, making me open for him. Suddenly he pulled back and moved over my body again, this time putting his body between my legs. This time he positioned his cock at my waiting pussy and pushed just the head inside, feeling how wet I was. I moaned as he slowly slid his cock in and out of my body, sliding over my body. I moaned and sighed as his cock slowly slid in and out of me.</p> <p>"It feels like the biggest cock I have ever had," I said softly, still grasping at his hands. I ran my fingers through his hair, then took my hand away from his. I grabbed his hair and pulled his face closer to mine, kissing him as we slowly fucked each other. We began to go faster, his cock sliding in and out of my body in ever deeper strokes, faster and stronger. I could feel my body tighten, my pussy walls clinging to the swollen length of his cock. My body began to tremble and a deep guttural moan escaped me. My body began to shudder and shake and I felt him deep inside, as he pulled my body hard against him. My entire body jerked and writhed against his body with all the pleasure of the orgasm. I could feel his cock moving in and out of my body as he continued to stroke his cock in and out of my body. Suddenly he thrust his cock deep inside me, filling me completely with his body. I moaned into hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
