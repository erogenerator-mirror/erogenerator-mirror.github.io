I kissed her back, trying to memorize something different around her mouth. Our kiss began to change from kissing back to more than kissing. Our bodies were soon rubbing together each time our mouths moved in sync. Her arms were around my neck, and my hands were on her thighs.</p> <p>My left leg was between hers, so I moved my knee between hers and her body could feel my leg on her thigh. I felt her thigh begin to rub up and down the length of it. I had to have more of her. I moved off top of her.</p> <p>“I know you think I'm gonna suck your cock tonight,” she said in her deep southern drawl. “But it’s getting close to our date night. Is that all right?” she pressed her lips against mine. “Are you ready?” she asked. She was so into this kiss.</p> <p>“Sure!” I agreed.</p> <p>“Okay, but you better start the party when we start it. I wanted you all ready to eat pussy first as soon as I got off the phone. If you are gonna eat me first, I’m gonna start getting all your dates hungry for me in a minute. You better start the party too.” As I kissed her I got off the bed and moved to the nightstand. I opened one of the drawers and pulled out the condoms along with my wallet and keys. I had never been in a motel before, but knew I never wanted to stop it. I got on the bed on my back, grabbed the condoms and a lube, walked behind her and slid the condom onto my cock.</p> <p>“I knew you weren’t going to go through with this. I heard all the guys out here on the phone when you came over here tonight. That’s why you did this, so you could drive them crazy. I heard you telling them no to the little bitches in the office on the phone. I’ve been there several nights. They won’t know I’m with you all night long. That just means you get to fuck some little sluts tonight. That just means this.”</p> <p>“That, is it!” I nodded, and then grabbed her hips and began to lift her up and down. She kept talking to me, telling me how big my dick was, how good it felt inside her, how tight her pussy felt and how fucking hot she was… She began to moan more, and as her lips were around my cock and her pussy was squeezing it, I could feel everything through my cock that I had just shot all over her, including the condom. “I didn’t tell you I was gonna be wearing them.” I said, as I pulled her hips back and sat her on my cock. I was going slow and gentle at first, wanting to build her in the process. After just a few minutes of that, she got up high enough to put my cock back inside her. She started to grind on me hard, moving her hips in the opposite direction of my thrusts. She had my legs around her and her hand had my cock inside her as we fucked fast and hard. It was getting hard to keep my hands off her body. And there she was, with only her face and mine in between the moans I was making. There it was, and it felt amazing. And oh, it felt like I was going to get an orgasm the first time we fucked.</p> <p>She was moving faster as we got closer to coming. With one last thrust, she came long and hard on me. And then she leaned forward and laid on top of me. We didn’t let go of each other until we were ready to leave. She leaned far off of me and we fell asleep with my cock inside her.</p> <p>When I woke in the morning, I looked into her eyes and we laughed. We’d fallen asleep together. There was a lot to tell when we were that drunk. We didn’t talk about it, but we did tell each other about every detail that had happened since we were in bed together. We knew it wouldn’t be a big deal, even with a guy. It was only sex, but what a relationship. We knew it didn’t mean anything, but we certainly were still having lots and lots more sex. This is probably not our last time making each other come, but it certainly was the first time we had done it with one each. This is the best sex that we’ve ever—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
