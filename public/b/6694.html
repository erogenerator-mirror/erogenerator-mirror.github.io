I was already hard but I was surprised it took a minute to get fully hard again.</p> <p>"I can't be done with you!" she said with a smile and moved her face close to mine. We kissed, long and lovingly, like the lovers we were.</p> <p>"I have a surprise for you," she said and pulled me into her. My dick was hard now and I started to pound her in the missionary position while she was bent over the seat in her dress. I looked down to see her ass sticking up, waiting for me to enter it. I moved my penis up and down, into her, getting wetter with each thrust. With each deep penetration her moans became louder and closer to the music of their coupling. Her body began to tremble, the motion of her hips more pronounced, and her moans louder too.</p> <p>Her wetness covered me and I was sure I would have gone down again, but we were in her. I could feel her body quivering, but it was a good one, not like before. It was a lot stronger. I could feel the muscles of her hips pulling with each thrust.

The next minute, I came deep inside of her, feeling her grip me with her ass. There was nothing I could do and then I collapsed on top of her.</p> <p>"Shit! What, I didn't!" I said.</p> <p>"You'll see," she said. We both laughed.</p> <p>"I should go and finish the wine," I said and we dressed again. "I think I owe you tonight."</p> <p>"Oh, it's not to bad. And there is never enough for all this," she said and got up.</p> <p>"No," I said and grabbed her arm. She looked at my face for a minute. "Shall we go to my room?" she asked. The thought of seeing the room made me smile. We took her to her room and stood inside, staring into each others eyes. We had a moment of silence.</p> <p>"Thank you for everything, Anna," I said and took her by the handâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
