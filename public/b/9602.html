This thing with the twins is not going to have a happy ending for him."</p> <p>"The twins? How did I meet them?" she asked.</p> <p>"Oh, uh, one is not exactly well behaved. They are just annoying."</p> <p>"You're saying they're not doing anything?" she asked.</p> <p>"Oh, they're not. But they are a couple of girls I just met. They're cute, not bad. They're my age."</p> <p>"And?"</p> <p>"I want to get back at them for stealing my boy. Maybe my husband might ask where I came from so he could do his best for me," I answered. At this the blonde smiled and ran her hand along both of my inner thighs. She lifted my skirt up and began to massage my clit. "You don't mind?"</p> <p>I couldn't answer her but I felt my breathing quicken. My pussy throbbed and I felt my legs give way as the orgasm welled up from deep inside me. Her finger rubbed my clitty faster and faster until it felt as if I'd burst into flames. I felt dizzy and went limp in her arms.</p> <p>"Oh, it's really nice," she cooed as she rubbed my clit harder. "I like that. Did I say something wrong?" she asked.</p> <p>"You don't have to say anything," I whispered in her ear. "You just said yes to his name."</p> <p>"Oh, it's okay. It felt good really. His dick is nice. We've shared him many times before. I've even sucked him off once but even that was with one thing at a time I promise. It's going to be okay."</p> <p>I held tightly to her as she continued to rub my clit. After a few moments I realized she was in full control. I closed my eyes and felt her tongue on my neck as her fingers worked more and more speed. I felt her mouth on me and she sucked gently, not biting, just gently holding me and making me feel every touch.</p> <p>"Oh my God!" she groaned when my orgasm peaked. "You cumming and all alone in a room like that? You're a virgin?" The look of surprise on her face and the way she looked in my eyes sent a jolt straight down the length of my body. How did she know? I felt self conscious but felt like her too. She continued to suck on my neck and stroke my clit as I began to come down from the high.</p> <p>"I'm sorry I asked," she said as she lifted her head and looked at me. "I wasn't talking about my age. I did it all while I watched you, but I should've thought I would." Looking into my eyes she licked her lips. "Your dick is hard."</p> <p>My body betrayed me at this statement. I felt my legs weaken as my orgasm rocked my body. She continued to suck softly as her other hand rubbed the area around my clit. I had never felt so close to another person as I felt myself falling headlong into another orgasm.</p> <p>The next few hours were my most erotic time. I had no idea where the sex or the story line came from but the sensations were unreal. My body was racked with a series of orgasms that left me delirious from the pleasure. My vagina pulsing with energy after the intensity of the experience. My thoughts turned to our time and the experience while I sat with a pillow under my head watching the stars. My clit was a throbbing hard, swollen and sensitive organ. My nipples ached aching and each wave of pleasure took my breath away. I felt alive, my body responded, and with each muscle contraction I felt that familiar tingle that signaled my impending orgasm.</p> <p>"I'm getting close. I want your cock inside me. Just hold off," I implored.</p> <p>"Okay," she said as she leaned back into the pillows she was draped on. She ran her finger along the ridges on my clit as if she was feeling each movement and feel. "I'd be okay with that. You aren't a virgin."</p> <p>My eyes drifted closed and I imagined I was about to feel a cock between me legs.</p> <p>"You are," I whispered as I held her legs down around her waist.</p> <p>"Yeah, and I've got that cock. Are you ready for that?" she asked.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, I've been ready for weeks. If it's okay we can do it now." She leaned down and took the head of my clitty into her mouth making me groan loudly.</p> <p>The thoughtâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
