Her legs spread wide and she lifted her hips, meeting with his own rhythm as he moved slowly into her, sliding deeper and deeper inside her with each pass of his dick. Her body tightened as he finally bottomed out, hitting her deepest spot. Her cunt tightened around his dick as he held himself still for a moment, then slowly he began to move, his thick body sliding smoothly into her moist depths as he started pumping into her slowly, his balls slapping against her. Her eyes were half closed as he watched her, his hands cupping her breasts as his lips moved against hers with his tongue, the sensations so intense that she was completely out of her mind with pleasure.</p> <p>His words, his slow, intense thrusts brought a slow smile to her lips as she started to rock against his hips faster, the vibrations from her moans flowing through her body, her hands moving to his back. She felt completely in control as her body responded to his movements as her head rolled back and her eyes closed as her own breathing became heavier as she felt herself on the precipice of a new orgasm. He wasn't going to let her cum without him, she didn't care that he was driving her to the brink and she was so totally in his power. She could feel him, felt the power as his long cock pushed into her as deep as it would go, the intensity of his thrusts as she felt him slam into her and her breasts rubbed up and down against his hot chest, her whole body tingling with the excitement. He was all hers, she knew it… it was too much...</p> <p>He was so close to her now, in the moonlight she could just make out a faint outline of his face as he lifted his mouth to kiss her. His eyes were focused on hers and she felt him, the force of his body, the pressure as he pressed against her… The pressure as he slowly sank his teeth into her neck, the pressure as his cock, the pressure as her body clung to him, the pressure and the heat as he pulled her body closer to him.</p> <p>The heat spread through her like wildfire, a fire as the cold night air caressed her as they melted together, the heat of the moment spreading through them as they both slowly and completely surrendered to their needs. As their passion overtook them she realized that she had forgotten how she had felt so long ago… and here she was, lying on the bed, naked beneath him and he was inside her… she almost forgot the fact of herself as she felt his body slowly moving between her legs as he pressed into her from behind, his hands on her breasts, his eyes on hers, and at last she felt his body tensing as he began to move within her.</p> <p>He held himself against her, his body pressed against hers as he held her as she lay beneath him. They were not one soul or mind, not even a body. No thought could exist within them, but all that there was in the universe had to be pure, even transcendent, and nothing could compare to it. He felt her pussy tighten around him, felt her body tense, felt her body start to rock as he leaned into her, and he heard her moans of pleasure over and over and they were soon joined by her own as he felt her body respond to his touch, responding fully to his thrust as his full length penetrated her.</p> <p>"I love you baby… oh my sweet little girl."</p> <p>Her words rang clear in her ears as pleasure filled her very being, and his own moans rang in his ears, and she couldn't think of anything else but him. Her own body, her whole being seemed to exist within him as his own orgasm crashed over her and she felt her own body move with the release of his orgasm, as his cock throbbed and throbbed within her as he pushed himself deeper inside her.</p> <p>He felt her body go completely rigid just as she felt herself come, and when he felt himself reach the end of his own orgasm, he also felt himself cum with her. Their bodies were joined tightly as they both felt each other and they heard their own breaths become ragged, but still they were joined as though they were one. They lay together for a moment as they both continued to feel themselves, but then he gently moved her so she was laying on her back, and slid his arms under her, his hands sliding around her while they moved, her arms hugging him as he lay on top of her, her legs wrapping around him, her hand sliding over his cock as he buried himself in her as deeply as they could, as long as it could go.</p> <p>They lay together for a long time then—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
