A bit of mutual selfishness makes up for it." He smiled and kissed her. "I've never been with anyone as passionate as you."</p> <p>"Good. I just wanted to know what kind of a guy you were. It wasn't your average college guy, you know. I only met you yesterday and I'd been with girls a lot."</p> <p>He kissed her again. "I've had plenty of women. I wasn't gay, and I wasn't stupid. I wouldn't do anything to hurt you."</p> <p>She smiled at him. "That's fine. That's why I want to know your name."</p> <p>"Eric. I am Eric." He laughed. "How old are you?"</p> <p>"I'm twenty-two." She said as they walked to the front of the bus. He was waiting for her, but couldn't look at her because of the bus.</p> <p>"Don't tell me you've had a roommate?"</p> <p>"No. We had that conversation in the bathroom. I thought it was too good to waste the information. And I didn't waste one bit."</p> <p>"Are you still in college?" He stared at her. She sat down and sighed.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Did you have a girlfriend?"</p> <p>"No, not anymore. Just got a new roommate a short while ago."</p> <p>"Why didn't you just leave?"</p> <p>She smiled.</p> <p>"I just needed a new relationship."</p> <p>"A relationship?"</p> <p>"Just like you. The relationship I have with you. We share everything." She looked at the floor, and then looked up at him. "So... you and me don't have a one-night stand?"</p> <p>He stared at her. Finally it came to him that she was actually serious.</p> <p>"I think that what I want is to share my life. We can't just get married like we did in high school. There's a real difference."</p> <p>She just stared at him, looking for an answer. He was still in shock. He didn't know what to say. But he knew.</p> <p>"I'm not a virgin. I've had sex with a lot of guys my age, probably a little more than most. I've also had sex with boys who are more fun since it's less expensive."</p> <p>"Is there any chance that you ever will want to have a relationship? I mean since I've known you..."</p> <p>"Not really, not really. I never actually had a boyfriend. Not for a long time, anyway. Now that the semester is over in college, I'm seeing a lot of attractive guys."</p> <p>"I am too." The bus had already come to a stop at her stop. "So... What about you? You've never had sex with a girl before?"</p> <p>She looked down at his empty glass and smiled. "Not really, not even to watch a porn." She took a sip of her wine. "Besides, I was with a guy before, who I met at the university." She smiled at him and leaned towards him. He put his hand in her lap and she smiled back.</p> <p>"I'm sorry about how you have to act around people." She leaned back. He reached for her hand, but she wouldn't let him.</p> <p>"Eric, let me," she said. "Let's not talk about it with anyone. You've never had a boyfriend or any kind of relationship. We can't just have a one-night stand. Please don't take this the wrong way."</p> <p>"If everything is nice, the relationship will have to change." He said and pulled her to him. It was as if he didn't have a care in the world.</p> <p>She wrapped her arms around him and felt his heart beat through his chest. He looked at her and smiled.</p> <p>"It's fine, honestly," he said and kissed her. She felt him harden in her hand. They kissed deeply, feeling each other's passion and hunger. They parted as they broke the kiss.</p> <p>"Eric, what are you doing?" She said. He looked at her and she saw the sparkle in his eyes.</p> <p>"Just kissing. It's not like I want to be around that girl I have a crush on."</p> <p>"I have to wonder if you are really that popular," she said with a grin. "And the boy you talk to is really smart too..."</p> <p>"Whoa, whoa," he said and took her hand. "Let me kiss that hot girl."</p> <p>His eyes were wide with excitementâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
