I was trying to regain some composure by thinking of the night before. I tried to focus on my work but I can still make an idiot out of myself. I looked at my watch and saw it was just about 9. I had time to get home and to shower before I was going to kill this man.</p> <p>As soon as I sat down to lunch my coworkers called to say they all had dinner ready to go and I could get ready and go pick them up at the restaurant. I put my food away and put out the trash to keep my sanity and went back out the door. My work was now done. I opened up my laptop and sent my email. As I finished getting ready and took my time looking at my email there was a message from her.</p> <p>Hello.</p> <p>I hope you enjoyed your evening. I hope you had a great time tonight. And I hope we will do it again.</p> <p>I just love having a date with an unexpected and beautiful woman.</p> <p>I can't wait and can't wait to see you again.</p> <p>Love,</p> <p>Lisa.</p> <p>She smiled to herself for a second before she closed up the message and placed it on her laptop. I had no idea what to do with it, but I did as she had asked, and sat in silence for a minute to take a moment to clear my head. In a minute I walked over to my desk and picked up the phone to speak to her.</p> <p>"I got it." I said before hanging up. I had to clear my head for a second.</p> <p>"Okay, you've got it." I said to myself, trying to come between Lisa and Rick. It finally clicked. It took everything I had left to not reach out for Lisa during that moment. I closed the phone up and went back to my work. I could feel my emotions building to the point of exploding again.</p> <p>I picked up the second file on the computer and opened it. This file was about ten minutes in length and very clean with little to no mention. I had printed the file and put it in to read through as soon as possible. As I finished up writing I was getting hot just reading this sentence of hers. She looked so beautiful to me and I couldn't even wait to see her again.</p> <p>I started to put my lunch into the fridge, when I heard a knock on my door.</p> <p>"I'm going into the den." Lisa said.</p> <p>"Ok, we can finish it here." I said, and got back into my chair.</p> <p>"Do you want to finish it before you go in?"</p> <p>"No, I want to finish the entire thing right away." I said in a tone of voice that made her feel so sexy.</p> <p>"That's a good decision, I'm trying to get you back to normal." She said.</p> <p>I got into my desk chair and pulled her towards me. As we locked lips I grabbed her ass and pulled her tight against my body. She was already hard again, and the feeling of her lips on mine was making me want to ravage her. I couldn't get enough of her mouth. My hand was on her back and I could feel the swell of her breasts as my fingers traced their way down her body.</p> <p>"I was thinking of leaving before we both ended up here." I whispered in her ear.</p> <p>"I was thinking of leaving myself." She whispered back as she leaned against me.</p> <p>"Yes you were. And you knew what I wanted."</p> <p>The kiss broke. It was only a simple peck on the lips before we turned back to the project. I could only take so much. There was just so much going on at work just one moment in time. It was a whirlwind that had me wanting to make love to every inch of it. It was a few minutes before the first text message got transferred.</p> <p>I didn't see the text until I got back from the elevator. I got back to my room, and closed the door and got in my bed. "What's up?" I said to myself as I began to drift off.</p> <p>Lisa was busy in the kitchen talking on her cell phone with her boyfriend in her mind. I wanted to stop her before she ended things again. I decided that this time I would wait to see if she was still thinking it through. My heart was beating so hard that it felt like it was going to jump out of my chest any second.</p> <p>I couldn't seem to take it anymore. Every time I felt like I just wanted to kiss her again for a minute or two it happened. I was fighting it, but it seemed to be winning theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
