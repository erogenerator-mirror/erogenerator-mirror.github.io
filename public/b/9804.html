I lowered my mouth over her clit and felt and tasted my wife's warm cream seeping into my nose.</p> <p>It would be my first orgasm of the day.</p> <p>She started bucking against my face. I had never been there before, but I knew what I liked. Soon it slowed and then her body went limp. I knew that I must have had a large orgasm and I stayed with her for several minutes.</p> <p>"Did you like that?" I asked her.</p> <p>She smiled at me and got up.</p> <p>"It was amazing," she said.</p> <p>"You better get back before you fall out again, or we'll be finished for the day, you know you enjoyed it don't you?" I asked.</p> <p>She grinned at me and replied: "I just wanted to say yes."</p> <p>"Don't worry about it," I said with a smile.</p> <p>As she was getting back up, she smiled at me and said: "Maybe tomorrow, maybe."</p> <p>"Maybe," I asked her.</p> <p>"How will you get off?" she asked me.</p> <p>I laughed and replied: "I know one night stands don't always mean it. I'm just happy to be home, to be your lover."</p> <p>"I want to make out with both of us to prove to you that we have been meant for each other," she said.</p> <p>I smiled and got up from the bed, and lay on my back. She lay on top of me, and I felt her warmth and her breasts against my chest as we embraced. Her breasts were firm and soft, and felt warm as she covered herself against me.</p> <p>"How many times will you be able to make love with me?" I asked her.</p> <p>"You better fuck me," she said as she lifted herself up, and straddled me.</p> <p>"I don't think I can start now," I said as I held her ass in the air and moved my cock up against her pussy lips.</p> <p>"Fuck me, and I will enjoy it as much as you do," she assured me.</p> <p>I had waited for some time for this. I was rock hard, and felt like I could put any man of any age on top of me. I placed my hands over her ass and spread her cheeks, and pushed my cock inside her.</p> <p>She wrapped her arms and legs around me, and pushed back onto my cock.</p> <p>"Oh God," she said in a hushed tone, "fuck, I can feel that monster of yours in my pussy."</p> <p>She was making me crazy.</p> <p>"Oh yes!"</p> <p>I moved and pounded my cock in and out of her pussy. She started moaning and then groaning. Eventually, we climaxed, and we hugged and kissed, still passionately but without tongues going.</p> <p>As I relaxed, she looked at me with a small smile, and licked her lips.</p> <p>"I think I'm going to get you into the sack," she said.</p> <p>As we went back to my bed, we kissed again and got into bed on our sides.</p> <p>"If you get yourself off, we probably won't need anymore foreplay," I said as we drifted off to sleep.</p> <p>When the sun was just about to rise, I got up to go to the bathroom. As I did that, I heard her say: "Come over here." Then she giggled.</p> <p>So I did.</p> <p>We lay there a bit, and then she was on top of me. We kissed, and she kissed my mouth with each pass.</p> <p>"I need to check on the babies," she said.</p> <p>"I know," I replied.</p> <p>She climbed off me, and got up and went into the bathroom. When she came back, she had a wet washcloth and hand towel. She sat down on the bed, which was a little wider than mine, and sat down by my legs.</p> <p>"They're beautiful," she said as she reached for them.</p> <p>We hugged again, and then she leaned in to kiss me. I put my hand on her hip.</p> <p>"I'm going to do something, then, that would turn you on something."</p> <p>She moved from the kiss and went to my side.</p> <p>I lay there, waiting, watching her as she put the washcloth down, and then started to rub my leg. She kissed her way up to my stomach and took about half of my cock in between her lips. Then she started to lick the tip of my prick and slowly kissedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
