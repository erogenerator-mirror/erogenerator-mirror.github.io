In the meantime he had some real work he needed to finish up.</p> <p>With that in mind he let the phone down and headed to the shower.</p> <p>It was a big day and he hoped it would have a happy ending.</p> <p>~</p> <p>*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p> <p>The next day, the last school day of the year, David spent a lot of time in his room, reading his work papers and re-reading them until he was back in his bedroom to get ready for school that day.</p> <p>And today was all day, and it really made him a very busy man. Not too many other kids were at school, but David had to do his part.</p> <p>After having the shower and shaving, he laid on his bed and took some time to think. He had told his mother he wouldn't be back for a couple of weeks and he certainly wasn't going to be. At twenty-five, he was used to being the center of attention, but it was always difficult for everyone to understand that he had already worked himself into a routine that he was used to.</p> <p>David looked back at his mirror to make sure how he looked. He still couldn't believe his eyes, but at that moment his self esteem and self-worth would probably get to the point of becoming self-assured. And he certainly wasn't complaining about it now.</p> <p>David had spent too much time in his closet lately, and his clothes were hanging in there. He had no idea what he was going to do with them after the shower. His mother had always used to tell his friends that he had to start out the same way so he could do it. He was beginning to realize the truth.</p> <p>But the truth really was far, far out from his self esteem. He did wonder about his parents, but was beginning to wonder who he loved too. And he didn't want to be that person anymore.</p> <p>Now he just wished he'd let it all go as his mom had. He didn't want to ruin whatever things he had started in his life. He wanted his parents. And he desperately needed some release. As he had with most of his family, he just needed to let it out and it had gone out, but his brother, his mother and her friends were never there.</p> <p>David loved his mom and, like in his life, he wasn't going crazy. Maybe, it was because she was so damn good with his mother's children and he wouldn't be disappointed. Maybe, he was just too immature in the way her life was and his mom had grown. Maybe if she ever saw him, she would tell someone who he'd done something wrong which was always the worst. Maybe, he wouldn't need a father. He was tired of looking after things on the spur of the moment so he just would do anything for himself, and he would never have to get that way ever again.</p> <p>~</p> <p>~</p> <p>At ten to two, David was home and had a glass or two of wine. He decided to go to bed for a few minutes and hit the scotch on the rocks. He sat on the edge of the bed and relaxed when he heard the garage door close behind him. He knew his mother had gone to bed.</p> <p>"Hey you, where do you want to put your things?" his mom asked, pulling her overnight bag out of the closet.</p> <p>"Oh that's easy. I'm sleeping for a couple of minutes and need to take care of a few things in the bathroom," David replied, getting up and quickly dressing to take a shower.</p> <p>"Have you had any dinner?" David asked as he walked into the kitchen to grab a glass of wine from the fridge.</p> <p>"Oh, right about that. Do you mind if I come out with dinner?"</p> <p>"Just a peck on the cheek," he said and he could tell that something wasn't right. "There's really not anyone else in the house."</p> <p>"Are you sure?" she asked in sudden concern.</p> <p>"Absolutely," he replied. "My parents are out and I don't want to upset their plans, even though I don't know what to do about it."</p> <p>"And if I have a chance to be alone with you all day, would you mind?" she asked.</p> <p>"No, I definitely don't mind."</p> <p>"So, what's up?" she asked, sitting down on the edge of the bed with her drink.</p> <p>"Sorry, but I really want to talk to you," he started.</p> <p>"Of course. I understand," she said quickly, "just keep your voice down and let itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
