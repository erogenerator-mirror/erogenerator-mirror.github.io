He was definitely a young black man with a big dick, but from what I could see, so did the other guy. I tried not to seem too interested in what the man was saying, because he was too much like most of the young black men I dated. I guess we all had our needs met.</p> <p>"What'd y'all doin' together?" I asked him as his eye brows began to furrow.</p> <p>"I don't know if it's a 'till you say 'tenin'," I said, "but it sure ain't no' more than I thought it was."</p> <p>"That's better," he replied, getting up and reaching over to hand someone else his drink. "Come sit around that table, and don' worry about me, buddy."</p> <p>It was one of those black men, so I had a feeling about him, I guess. I had already been at least partially blind to what was going on, because I couldn't focus my eyes from my vantage point. I tried to concentrate on the big fat guy seated below me, but it was getting pretty obvious. I began to feel light headed, and felt my cheeks flush.</p> <p>"Whoa there, boy," someone said behind me. "You gonna be all right?"</p> <p>I looked back in the direction of the man sitting near me. He was a tall, dark man. Even though he was wearing a tight dress shirt, tight jeans and sunglasses, he looked kind of scary.</p> <p>"I'm doing fine," I answered, trying not to sound too defensive, and not to make him think there was anything wrong. Then I looked back at the older black man sitting across from me. He had blond hair, and in fact, looked like he had a good body on him. He had been drinking quite a bit, and it looked like he had finished his third or fourth drink.</p> <p>"Come on over here, and sit across from me, dude," he ordered. "My dad's got more room, and I get to have a piece of white cock, right man?"</p> <p>I smiled at him, thinking that might not be such a bad thing to do. The more I tried to pull away from him, the harder it was going to be. I looked behind me to avoid the man that had been sitting right beside me. I looked back at the older man sitting behind me, and to my surprise, the man wasn't looking at me. He was looking at the older man sitting a little way in front. He was staring at the black guy sitting just a little way in front of me.</p> <p>'Oh, my God,' I thought, 'the kid must be about nine years old, and all the kids he's hanging out with are around here. The old guy is gay, and I'm going to be gay for the rest of my life'</p> <p>Suddenly it hit me, the kid didn't even know me. I don't think he had ever met anybody. He's just been with an aunt and a sister, and a nanny, and an actual mother. I watched him, as he watched a little black boy, and tried not to make eye contact. My first reaction to his looks was to throw the kid off, when he was like that. Then his face started to warm up though, and before I knew it another huge black man had appeared in line behind him, and was staring at the kid.</p> <p>That's when I finally thought how it would probably be worse for the kid if we got caught, if they saw what was going on in front of them. But then my thoughts flashed. I felt a stirring in my cock, and started to get hard in my shorts, and then all thoughts turned to what the kid looked like.</p> <p>The old man, who I had always called 'Dad' or 'Dana', was sitting on the couch in front of me, and he was staring at my crotch. The old man reached over and took the kid's hand, and slid back, so it seemed he was rubbing the kid's thigh, and looking up I could see that his eyes were looking at the crotch of my shorts.</p> <p>The more I stared at them, the more I felt a stirring between my legs, and I felt my cock swell. I felt embarrassed and ashamed, and realized that the kid had an erection.</p> <p>"Sorry about that; I was just watching," I offered, trying to ease my embarrassment, "it's just that men are pretty..." It didn't seem appropriate to put my hand on my crotch.</p> <p>"No problem, I'll take care of it, just take your time, dude," the young man replied, as he put his hand on my thigh, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
