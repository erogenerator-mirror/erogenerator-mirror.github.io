When I came out, she was standing in front of her dresser, still in her nightgown. She looked up at me and smiled, her eyes sparkling. I came up behind her and whispered in her ear, "It's okay, sweetie. It's okay."</p> <p>She looked at my face. "You're sure?"</p> <p>"I always want to come home."</p> <p>She looked at the clock. "Wow, it's 5:30. I didn't see you home for sometime, so I was wondering if you wanted to go to bed." She took out a packet of tissues from her drawer and ran her finger along the paper between my teeth.</p> <p>I took it from her and opened her nightgown. "Here," I said. "Do you remember the night you caught me naked at the party?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I remember." She reached her hand underneath my jaw, over my tongue and let out a low moan. "I didn't do anything, really," she said.</p> <p>I kissed the side of her neck. "I've got you."</p> <p>"Me too."</p> <p>"Where are we going tonight?"</p> <p>"I don't know. Are you coming along?"</p> <p>"I don't know."</p> <p>"Okay, why don't you walk into the bathroom with me?"</p> <p>She turned to me. "I'll go get ready." She started to leave. I held her hand. "Come to my room."</p> <p>"Hurry," she whispered, pulling me against her. I felt the tip of my penis against her moist center. "Go to him," I whispered in her ear.</p> <p>"I'm sure his cock would like me."</p> <p>"I haven't made a man of him yet," I whispered in her ear.</p> <p>"You haven't..."</p> <p>I kissed her on her neck. "No, baby, I haven't let a man inside me." I whispered back to her. "I'm sorry."</p> <p>She backed right up and kissed me. "I've loved being the woman in that story."</p> <p>I cupped her breast, feeling the nipple tighten. "Is it okay if I take my panties off?"</p> <p>"You can take them off," she said, and slid them off my body while she kissed me again. "Just take your panties off. Let me see that thing of yours you've got."</p> <p>When she was bare and sitting down, I took my panties off and slid the tip of my cock between her lips. I felt it twitch while she kissed me there. "I can't tell if it was the wine, the alcohol," I whispered. "Maybe I should just go."</p> <p>"I don't want to," she said. "I'll wait until it's over." She kissed my neck again and said, "Let's go to bed." She stood and held me close. "I could never do this to you."</p> <p>"I'm glad you didn't. I've never been with another man other than Roger. I don't see why we shouldn't explore each other."</p> <p>"Are you trying to seduce me for fun again?"</p> <p>I shrugged. "To say the least. I'm a good person, and if you're going to play the game, I might as well."</p> <p>"You're not, amigo, I swear." She kissed me again.</p> <p>I slipped two fingers inside her while we kissed. "You're already wet," I said.</p> <p>She groaned. "That's right. And he didn't touch me this time. Why don't we go to sleep." She took my hand and led me to her bedroom. We kissed again right there in the middle of the queen-size bed. My penis was already hard again with the combination of the wine and sexual intoxication and I knew I wasn't going to get much sleep tonight. And there's no fooling myself in that by going to sleep, so I pulled her on top of me in the middle of the bed. She kissed me again, then went between my legs and started sucking. I moaned to her, and she took the length of my rod in her mouth while looking up at me. All the while she was sucking my cock, she kept pushing her tits into my body as far as she could.</p> <p>I felt her tongue at work, licking the underside my cock while she stroked the sides with her hands. I felt a warm, wet sensation on my thighs, but no orgasm. As her lips pressed tight, I started moving my hips so she could reach my balls while she sucked on the tip of my cock. When I leaned up a little I looked down at her.
