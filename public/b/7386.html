I stepped back to sit on the edge of his bed. "Undress me." My hands trembled as I began to take off his clothes, taking time to give him subtle caresses with my fingertips, his chest, and back.</p> <p>He took me in his arms, kissing me passionately. "Now that we have that over with, we have something more to have in mind."</p> <p>He took a few steps toward me, stopping at the bed. He pulled a small box out of the closet, which I opened eagerly on its slow journey down his thigh. Opening the box, I saw a small wooden dildo, but did not see what he had in its box.</p> <p>"I think I may have misplaced this, Sir. I think it may come from somewhere." I picked it up, and held it in front of my face. It was a beautiful toy, which he slid between his lips with a chuckle.</p> <p>I reached down to my bed to pick up something from my dresser. "Have you been using this all night, Sir?" I asked, holding it to my face as I took a deep breath.</p> <p>"It will do." He pulled off his shirt and shirt, dropping them to the floor with his shoes. Next, he pulled down his jeans and boxers, stepping out of them quickly. He had a cock between his legs, about seven inches in length and thick, standing straight up. I stared as he moved to the side of the bed, and pulled his underwear to the ground. He put his socks on in a rush, and crawled up to straddle my lap in the most submissive posture I had ever seen.</p> <p>He grabbed my hand and brought it to the toy, placing it on one of his nipples, then lowering it to the other. The feeling of my hand on him was different from any I had with men, and even more so this time. It reminded me of the pain of men in the field. Instead of doing anything, I closed my eyes, reveling in the sensations. It took my mind off my need to have him for a little while.</p> <p>"That's good, little one. Let your body become a part of the experience," he said.</p> <p>He lowered his mouth to my nipples, licking and kissing them. His hands played with my breasts, tweaking my nipples as I felt a throb in my thighs, and moaned quietly.</p> <p>I felt him reach down to the toy, and rub the top in small circles, which made my pussy drip. "It's time, Sir." He raised himself up on the bed, pulling me up with him in the reverse position. He slid the toy in between my legs, and began to rub it on my clit, still with his mouth on mine. I felt weak in my knees, and knew I would do anything at that point to please this man.</p> <p>"What's the verdict, Sir." My breathing was getting faster and harder, knowing he wouldn't stop if I stopped.</p> <p>"It did," I answered, as if he would hear me. He pulled me up on his other side, and pressed the tip of the toy against my vagina. The shock that went through me made me jump.</p> <p>"The dildo will go in if that is what you want, Sir." He pushed the top half back in, and lifted my legs up over his, his hands on either side of me.</p> <p>"Oh, I want more . . ." I began, struggling to speak as he pulled out, and slammed the entire length in. I began to move my hips, and was rewarded with some of his own, which sent a little spurt into my pussy.</p> <p>I turned around and knelt, facing away from him and began to run my fingers through my hair. "What the hell are you doing?" His hand reached out toward my shoulder, but I raised it, holding our hands steady. "No, this is my job," I corrected him, as a second thought occurred to me that this might be something good after all.</p> <p>"I think we're going to try something a little different."</p> <p>"Like what?" I asked nervously, my fingers running along my neck.</p> <p>"I'm going to take your mouth."</p> <p>"I don't want to feel your teeth." It came out as a groan of frustration, but not a threat, only a question.</p> <p>"I don't understand what we're agreeing on." I took the hand that was playing with my breasts, and pulled it away from the hand to see. "Do as you are told. This isn't punishment. This is a time for you to let your submission and self-pity grow."</p> <p>"But the dildo â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
