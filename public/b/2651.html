He laughed.</p> <p>"Is that all we got?" I asked, with a little trepidation.</p> <p>"Yep, your old car is a '69 Ford Falcon. It's a bit of a mystery to me though. You wouldn't think that you were doing something illegal because of me." He said and I felt a little more comfortable.</p> <p>"Really. Well, the insurance company was doing a lot of checking on us." I replied.</p> <p>I didn't want him to think I was some kind of pervert, or that I was going to help him with his car with a car like he had. And even though I had agreed to help him get rid of his car, if I had done something to upset him, would it be any real harm? I would never be the same if someone had told him that I was cheating on him. That would never happen.</p> <p>"I didn't know you were doing anything, and if it was something you wanted to do, I guess it wasn't for you. I'll take that as a yes."</p> <p>"You really have no idea what a pervert you are. That is all I can say." I told him with a pouty look.</p> <p>"I have to admit that you are pretty much a nice looking car." He said, with a smirk.</p> <p>He looked me over for a bit and asked; "Do you think this is cheating on me?" He asked, in a playful tone.</p> <p>"Well, for sure. I don't care if it is, but if it wasn't for me or having you with me there, I wouldn't feel as comfortable with you. I only care if it is, because I want to see you again." I told him.</p> <p>"You are so bad and if you weren't so nice, I would still think about you. When I see you again, I wish that you would come along. I am really looking forward to seeing you too. I would like to know your name and what the chances would be."</p> <p>"You know that I love this guy. If I didn't have him, I wouldn't be cheating on him. You and your car would do great together." I told him looking him in his sparkling eyes.</p> <p>"Now, since you are going to make me leave without so much as taking my car, do you want to drive me back to my parents?"</p> <p>"Well, that is kind of the idea, thank you." I said with a smile. I was just as nervous as he was about getting back into his car.</p> <p>"No, I don't think that I have a choice about that." He said, as he smiled and turned and walked off.</p> <p>I sat in the car for a minute and just looked out the window. I knew that there was nothing that I could do about the situation, even if I wanted to help him. The more I thought about the situation, my head started to sweat a little. I felt like I had to get to the bathroom, but instead I sat in the car and went inside. I turned on the heater, then got out and walked quickly to the bathroom. I ran water and sat on the cold porcelain seat and soaked in it, thinking about my day. As I sat there pondering my life with him, I could see the way that his blue eyes seemed to be glistening as if he had just come through the window. I could also tell by his reaction that he was thinking along the same lines as I was.</p> <p>"Wow, did you see that? I could have sworn that you were looking into my eyes". I told him, as he just stared at me. He just laughed and laughed with me as I thought about my life. I thought about how great he looked even if he was a stranger to me, he was definitely not some sleazy hooker. It just got me to wondering.</p> <p>"I didn't know that you were that kind of car thing." He said finally.</p> <p>He didn't know. He had gotten pretty good at looking into my eyes. He had given me two of the best blow jobs I had ever gotten from anyone. I was going to make sure to pay him back. With the combination of the hot water and him watching me as I looked into his blue eyes, knowing that I could do such a wonderful job, what more could a woman want. And he was so damn horny!</p> <p>"Well, if I had known that you were that kind of car thing, I would have asked." I told him. It was then thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
