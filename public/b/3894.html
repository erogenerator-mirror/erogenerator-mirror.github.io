I asked. He looked up from my cock again. I was already so horny, and he seemed to know it.</p> <p>Taking my cock in his mouth for the first time ever, his tongue caressing the head and back, he asked me once again to be sure.</p> <p>"Oh, yes!" I responded, "It's all right."</p> <p>Then I saw my chance to try.</p> <p>I picked him up and sat him on the couch while he took in the sight. We both lay naked on our backs on the couch, and looked at each other. I reached down to his cock. He moaned and leaned his head back. I grabbed my cock and stroked it. He stared up at me with wide-open lust-mastered eyes.</p> <p>I rubbed the head, coating the underside with pre-cum. Then I slowly entered him.</p> <p>"Mmmmm..." he murmured, "So nice."</p> <p>I leaned forward and licked his lips. I could taste his cock on them, and loved the sensation. Then I started to pump him slowly in and out of his ass.</p> <p>He moaned with pleasure and grabbed the back of my head, pulling it into him. He arched his back and rocked his cock in and out of his friend's mouth.</p> <p>I leaned back and closed my eyes as his hot mouth felt wonderful as well as mine. I could feel his cock twitch inside me and felt his muscles tighten. He was getting closer and closer.</p> <p>I leaned forward, thrusting my cock back and forth into him. I pulled the sides of his mouth against mine, holding him in me at the same time. He moaned and grabbed my ass, pulling me into him.</p> <p>At the same time, my cock was pulsing and pulsing inside his tight ass. He rocked his hips back and forth into mine.</p> <p>"I'm gonna come," he muttered softly, and began thrusting back at me. His ass grabbed at the base of my cock and milked it dry of his come.</p> <p>I had no intention of letting him come. He had already come once this evening, and I hadn't, so I didn't have it tonight.</p> <p>I lifted him from his knees and kissed him, letting his cock slip from my ass. He smiled and put his arms about my neck.</p> <p>"Thank you, James," he murmured.</p> <p>"You don't have to say that," I responded. "That's not how a relationship works."</p> <p>I sat back on my haunches. I grabbed James's cock in my hand and pulled on it, making him raise his hips and thrust into my hand.</p> <p>"No... don't," he said. "It doesn't work that way."</p> <p>I smiled, and sat forward on the couch, reaching around with my free hand and feeling his hot cock. "It wouldn't hurt me too much to fuck it," I explained. "It's what a friend would do."</p> <p>He lay down on the couch and pulled me over him. He wrapped his arms around me as I straddled his hips. I leaned back toward him. I lowered myself on his cock. It slipped in past the tight barrier of my pussy lips, and he groaned.</p> <p>"Oh... God..." he whispered.</p> <p>"It's alright, too," I told him. "Just... stay still a sec."</p> <p>I began riding him. I let him lift me up off of him. I pulled his ass up against me.</p> <p>"I love to fuck you James," I admitted.</p> <p>We lay that way for a long moment. I began to feel his hard cock sliding in and out of my pussy. I held it and enjoyed the tightness. As we continued to move together, I felt him push back against me.</p> <p>Soon, we were all moving together, and he wrapped his legs around me. He thrust into me, and I held him still, holding him inside me as he pushed back again. He held my waist and pushed his hips up.</p> <p>I felt his cock begin to swell up again. He held it deep inside my pussy and began thrusting again. I began to moan and move my hips to meet him.</p> <p>"I love you," I hissed into his ear. I pressed my lips to his. "I love you more than you'll ever know."</p> <p>We remained motionless for a while. James held me in his arms. We kissed. We rocked our bodies together.</p> <p>"I love you," he said once again. "I love you so very much." He smiled at me.</p> <p>"I love you, too," I said, and we both got our breaths back.</p> <p>That was the weekend the three of usâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
