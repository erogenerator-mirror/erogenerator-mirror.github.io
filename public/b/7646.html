She had never seen anything before and yet she was enjoying it. This was the kind of sex she had hoped for. She put her hand on the glass.</p> <p>"It's pretty warm, doesn't it?" he asked.</p> <p>She blushed. She knew her hair had to come out a little more than this, but he said it as he had done a few times before and she said that that would help. She felt a little more embarrassed, but she put her arm on his thigh.</p> <p>"Sorry about that," he said, giving her some of his thigh to put on her hand so that he could see.</p> <p>It's ok. No one else should be looking at us."</p> <p>She felt the glass getting warmer as she did so. She didn't know how to remove it, she was not used to the outside temperature. She slowly pulled it back down again and put it away. As she did that, her hand moved inside the jacket a little and began to do a little more exploring. She could feel her breast under the fabric, and the curve of her nipple was clearly visible to him. It had been a few days since someone had seen those. She let her hand linger for a little longer as she thought of where it could go next. He didn't seem to notice, giving her what she was so proud of. He was looking very intently at the door as he worked out why she wasn't doing this more often. He took one hand and pulled up the outside of her skirt, then the other. He gave that one of his thumb a little squeeze, his eyes looking up to meet her eyes.</p> <p>She let out a little gasp. The coolness of the cold glass was making her nipples stiffen.</p> <p>He let out a low whistle. "Ah, that looks hot!"</p> <p>She quickly put her hand inside her jacket, moving it up to play with her nipple with that one. She heard him move a little more, moving her jacket open. Her nipple was now erect and she had to move her hand to adjust it in the tight fabric of it. While he did, she brought a hand down to her crotch, sliding her hand back up the outside of her skirt to caress herself. She moaned.</p> <p>The way he looked at her, she knew she was going to let him do what he did a lot. He was like an animal in heat. It was exciting her to know people looking at her, and knowing that she was giving them a show, and knowing that she could get them off before they even came. Her own excitement, though, made her feel dirty. It took everything she had not to touch herself as she watched him and her hand working. But it was better than all of that. She had never come this way with anyone before. The feeling turned her on.</p> <p>"Oh, fuck," she thought to herself.</p> <p>Her head bent towards his right hand and she let out a soft moan. Her whole body was shaking on the brink of orgasm.</p> <p>"Yeah. That's good. Harder," she whispered into his ear, trying to pull his hand even farther onto her as she tried to maintain control of herself.</p> <p>She closed her eyes and let her head back and enjoyed the feel of his hand, fingers moving over her body, but his other hand was moving down to her hip, pulling. He was pressing her against the wall and he was not letting up. He was going to make her come, and she loved it.</p> <p>"Uhnnn," she moaned. It felt incredible to have him there, touching her. He was moving his hand more and more, rubbing up onto her. It felt like his hand was stroking her for everything, and she did enjoy that. Her mouth stayed open, looking at him, letting him see and hear what she did. Her back began to arch and she let out a short, quick cry.</p> <p>"Uhnnn. Holy fuck! Shit!" she thought to herself. She looked at her breasts which were now covered in a sheen of sweat.</p> <p>She looked back at him. She was breathing hard, and her hair was flaking behind her. Her nipples were hard, like little pebbles on rocks. She knew if she would move now, he would have his hand on them, and she knew she couldn't and she would come.</p> <p>With a low cry, she came. As he kept his hand on her, he lifted a bit and rubbed her nipple again with his thumb. A little squirt of her pussy juice came out from her lips as she felt her orgasm building again in her body. His fingers were moving, stroking her now. His cock was throbbing with excitement, and he was slowly lifting and dropping her on the glass again and againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
