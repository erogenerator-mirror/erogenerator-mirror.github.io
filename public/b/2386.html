I was worried that once she got naked and she went to the bathroom she would be all embarrassed and ashamed and I'd see that little bit of shame on her face. If he found out, he'd have to find a way to tell her how a boy would do that, but knowing that it would send her to the toilet.</p> <p>I was in my own world and didn't think about being nude in front of all these people for one second. If all my plans went out the town and I showed her how a woman could enjoy it, I'd have probably done it too and it would have been fun. Now, all the stories I'd been given in the past about being seen doing things sexually by one or more of the college students that I knew, I was now living it and in a very private place with three naked women in the open air. It would be like going to a party with all the students, all the young men in attendance and most of them showing off a lot of their young bodies. There was nothing wrong with it and even though the young men weren't all that big and had a nice sized cock, it was still wrong for their mother to look at this and tell them that to come to a party and that she wasn't looking at anything.</p> <p>"Well, I think he'd have us all naked in front of all these people and there would be plenty of things for everyone to see. I'm not sure it's a good idea."</p> <p>"I don't like thinking that it's possible but it might have happened if you had told us to do that. We have to, or we wouldn't be here."</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I said. "I thought that you enjoyed it."</p> <p>"I don't," she said. "But it was fun. In fact, the fact that it was like a dream come true, I'd have had more fun if someone had let us do it. It was exciting and exciting. He has to get used to it."</p> <p>"Well," I mumbled," you could have waited until you were home. We might as well take our clothes off, since that is what you are doing, aren't you?"</p> <p>"Of course," she said. "It's exciting all the time and fun when we're home and I'd get excited."</p> <p>"Well, I'd love it if you took off your clothes and went to the bathroom."</p> <p>"Oh, my, I wouldn't mind that!" she said. "It's so exciting and exciting to feel all that naked and want it. I'd also like it if you'd let me wash your front." Without thinking about it, I blurted out what she had said: "There you go!"</p> <p>"Do you mean it?" She said. "It's embarrassing to be naked in front of all these boys?"</p> <p>"Yes," I said. "It's embarrassing to strip and let all the young men see what they didn't see last night. It's even more embarrassing for me to do this on the front, knowing that it would expose the whole front of my body."</p> <p>Before I finished that sentence, it occurred to me that she had spoken the word "your" in a quiet and loving way. What was she thinking? Was she thinking of getting naked herself and letting a bunch of young men expose her? "No!" I thought. She meant it. I mean, at least I know that she means it. Now I just had to decide what to do. I'd never done anything like this before and I didn't know what to do with the whole situation. But, with the thoughts and feelings of having this all the way in my head, and the other women at least in my head, there was now only one option left to do it. It wasn't a decision I made; it was a decision that could only change this whole evening by taking some of it in the next day.</p> <p>So, I did the only thing that could save me from embarrassment and a whole lot of having to do with how it would feel. I took my clothes off and took my cloths into the bathroom. When I got to her bedroom door I decided that even though she was right over there, it was a risk to do this. I knocked once and told her I had the room to myself. She opened the door and took her robe off and came out naked again. Then she just stood there looking at me and said, "Oh, youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
