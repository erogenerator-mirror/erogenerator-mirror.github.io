She just wanted to make sure she would come home smelling of sex and piss that day. She had a hard time staying focused.</p> <p>"Now get the table ready. Make sure your backside is still good. And bring your chair over here, so I can tie you down."</p> <p>She watched him carefully. He was very nice looking, with blonde streaks and dark skin. She could not be sure that was the reason for her not wearing panties. "I will be right back."</p> <p>She headed to the kitchen, and got a drink, and sat at the edge of the tub. She thought of a way to help him. While she was working, he walked into the bathroom. She had to bend over and bend for him. She saw she had a perfect ass. It was firm and smooth. She stood while he bent over to get the cloth, and when he had the cloth in his hand, she quickly reached behind, grabbing his penis and pulling it away from his body. She took it between her legs, and rubbed for him, feeling the softness. The water was cold, but she felt herself getting wetter as her excitement got stronger. She leaned back into the tub and put her hands behind her head.</p> <p>"You look lovely, honey. Do you know why I am bringing this up," he asked her.</p> <p>"I think I know sir," she answered, smiling.</p> <p>"Go back and work for me for a while, and then we can go eat and talk, and play," he said. He put down his towel, standing back and watching her. "But you cannot look, and I will not let you. You have to do as you are told. If you keep playing with your pussy, I won't let you come."</p> <p>In response, she reached up, cupping the firm globes of her ass and squeezed them.</p> <p>"Yes sir."</p> <p>He picked up the razor, and started to remove the hair that had grown between her legs. That was so much more sensitive than masturbation alone, she thought. He did this a few times and she was very close to cuming, and would then want to stop before it was too much longer. But his touch was so gentle, so careful. After he had completed the shave, he took her hand, pulled it up behind her, and began to run his fingertips up and down her outer labia. She knew this was a sensitive little button, and he had not touched it this before. She pushed against the plug that kept her pussy open. She closed her eyes and leaned back again. This time, she felt his warm hands run over them down her inner thighs. He slowly pushed two fingers inside her. He pushed his fingers in deeper, and she relaxed even more. After a few moments, he pulled them out completely, leaned forward and kissed her. It was a little odd, but nice.</p> <p>He held her, pulled up his knees and sat her in his lap. He looked at her again. "Is everything going to be alright?" he asked.</p> <p>"I think so," she said, smiling. "Can we take a shower? If you're not wet, I can take my bath."</p> <p>"That would be nice," he said. He stood up, and held her arms. He led her into the shower, turned it on, and closed the door before standing. He lifted her off her feet. He grabbed the soap and began to wash her body. She moaned as he soaped and washed her. After he was done, he handed her the soap for the second time. "How long is it going to take me to clean you?"</p> <p>"We should have some privacy," she responded.</p> <p>"I'm not going to take it slow. Please let me finish." His hands left her, and she felt him rub her shoulders. "I'm done with you," he said, reaching back to turn off the water. "I'm going to put on a towel, and we can continue here." She let him turn the water off, get out, and leave. But she wanted to be sure. She had made up her mind that she would go through with this with her body, and she would do exactly as he asked. She didn't have to wait anytime.</p> <p>That day had really taught her what it meant to be submissive. There was no going back to what happened, but as she got older, she was very careful when not being disciplined.
