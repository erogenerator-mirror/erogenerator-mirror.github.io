I took her into my arms, and we kissed, soft and sweet. After a bit, she broke the clinch, and said, "We shouldn't have done that."</p> <p>My heart melted. I said, "Oh really", and I said to her, "Well then you're in big trouble again, what can I do to help you out?" I took her into my arms again, and our mouths came together in a kiss that I could taste, almost enough to send me into ecstasy, she could feel the full length of me, pressing against her. The feeling alone was indescribable, and we broke it again.</p> <p>She said with a look of determination, "My god, you've got the most amazing cock. I couldn't be happier."</p> <p>At that, she pulled the robe from my body, and pulled me into the bedroom, laying me on the bed. She then lay down beside me, kissed me deeply again, and said, "I'm so wet," as she ran her fingers up and down my inner labia, while her fingers played in my folds. She brought her hand to my mouth, and said, "There's nothing more beautiful than a woman licking her own pussy juice."</p> <p>She took my hand, and brought it to my lips, again. Her finger played in my folds before slipping into my mouth. She removed her finger, and again brought it to her lips, and said in a sexy voice, "There's a lot of wetness there." I sucked my juices from her finger, tasting the juices, that were now flowing freely. She moved her finger up and down my slit several times, sliding a third finger in, adding more fluid, before entering my wetness. She moved my middle finger in and out a few times, and said, "I told you I could do it."</p> <p>She was in the zone now. She was ready with me. I got up slowly, and lay down beside her. We kissed for a while, and then she moved over me. I felt her pussy spread open, and her hands reach into my open robe, and she pulled on the ties, opening my robe fully, and revealing my naked body to her.</p> <p>I turned to look at her and said, "Why did you tell me I could touch you?" I kissed her and replied, "The only thing I want to put your finger in, is your own pussy." She kissed me, said, "And I want you to cum with me." I reached across to turn on the bedside lamp, a little more then needed. We kissed again, this time much more passionately. I reached over and began to massage her breasts. They were very beautiful. While massaging her breasts, both hands were exploring each other. She was moving her hands on my nipples, pulling and pinching. I was starting to have second thoughts. I stopped for a second, and said, "I have to pee." I pulled off the bed robe, and slid off the bed, down and retrieved a warm towel, and threw it on the floor. Leaving my side at the door, I got the bottle of perfume from the night stand, and returned the bed, taking off my robe. I walked over to the chair I brought from the bathroom downstairs. I poured a generous glob of perfume on her neck, and on my finger. I turned around, bent over, and kissed her deeply. "Mmmmm, that feels so good, I want more of that."</p> <p>I moved my ass over, so that I could reach between her legs, which were spread wide. I felt, for a moment, her fingers in my opening, and then she pulled back, and said,</p> <p>"Please."</p> <p>I put my finger to her lips. She sucked her own juice from my finger. "I want more." She said, "But first, we have to go." She took all the towels, but had her night gown on, and we walked out to the living room floor. We kissed and embraced one another. I looked down to her, and saw those marvelous breasts heaving up and down, as we held each other. I kissed her on the mouth, and she opened her mouth. We met in a passionate, deep, lip lock, our tongues exploring each other's mouths, for more then two, three. As I did, I moved my body over hers, kissing her, while my cock was sliding up and down her pussy. After what seemed like several minutes, she lifted me, and stood in the middle of the room, facing me. Then she bent, and took me in her mouth. I felt my first sensation of another woman's mouth, for she was much more experienced than I'd imagined, in how she could do me, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
