"After everything that happened you still don't get it. I think you are more confused than that. You are feeling pretty good. Do what you want to do. I want to look into your eyes.</p> <p>"But... I just want to be alone with you. I just want to be with you."</p> <p>"Why do you want to be with me?" I asked.</p> <p>"Because I'd like to be. I want to share you. I just love you more as your soulmate."</p> <p>It was one of those moments where a small part of me became one with my body telling me this was better than leaving you. I would have to ask you to talk to my wife about this. I had to think of something to respond. "Is there anything I can do to make this work?" I asked.</p> <p>My wife said, "Sure" as she got up and moved towards me. "Do you want the same treatment?"</p> <p>"Of course. What else can we do?" I answered.</p> <p>"We just don't have any toys. There is something you can do," she said as she opened some drawer in the bed and removed a small red ball.</p> <p>I looked at the small ball. It was very uncomfortable. "Can you get some lotion? Let me get this in and do it." and I helped her into it.</p> <p>I was now lying between her legs. I could feel her warm legs and her hands holding mine. "The worst is behind. I'm going to rub some out and we'll see soon," she said laughing as she rubbed some of the lotion over my chest.</p> <p>"I guess I could give you some more," I laughed.</p> <p>I got a bunch of my hands so she could rub and squeeze. She moved between my legs and I wrapped my hands around her so I had her. "You did very well," I told her as she smiled at me.</p> <p>"Thank you, I loved being yours. It was like you knew my mind from before. It was easy and I was just learning your body. I just needed to be around more." She said as she was rubbing my dick and balls.</p> <p>"So, you aren't going to leave it alone? Well, since your husband has already told you the good and bad side of sex. You will have to wait until marriage to meet him, so what's the harm."</p> <p>She nodded her agreement as I pulled down my boxers and dropped my legs back. She got a grip on my cock as she started to move her hand up and down. "So you like being tied up like that, then? And having your husband tied up?" she asked between strokes.</p> <p>I felt her tongue licking my cock. "It feels good. It feels good just a little bit, like when you have to hold something. But there's always you."</p> <p>She took my cock all the way into her mouth and started to bob up and down on me. Her mouth was just too much. She was trying to make me cum over and over again. But at this point I could use it as my last shot of the evening. I started to moan and she knew what I was thinking. She pulled off. "You'll have to take it easy though, you might start to cum."</p> <p>She sat up and I grabbed my half hard dick and started to jerk it. "I'm right behind you, you can't cum while you're tied."</p> <p>My wife leaned over and gave it a kiss. "I love it when you talk about how much I love being helpless, but it doesn't exactly hurt anyone."</p> <p>At that point I went in for the kill. A blowjob. My wife got a lot of practice. I was about to let loose and give her some more of my cream, but she stopped me.</p> <p>"Hold on a second, I'll get some lotion to ease you back." She grabbed a small tube from the drawer and held it out.</p> <p>I got ahold of the lotion and started to rub it into my feet trying to give her some more control. This was kind of stupid. I didn't want to cum yet. But I did want me to cum. I put lotion down on my arms and hands.</p> <p>I started to rub it in between my legs. And she could tell, I was moving my fingers down and up with my arms. "You can rub it on my breasts if you can get away with it," she said.</p> <p>"That's a no. I want you doing it," I said as I grabbed my dick.</p> <p>I started to rub it between myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
