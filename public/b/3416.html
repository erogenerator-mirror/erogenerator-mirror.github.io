He pulled her back against him and kissed her, his fingers working her sensitive lips once more. He pulled away just as she reached her first orgasm. "Oh, I know!"</p> <p>"Did you have a good time?"</p> <p>"A lot really." She sighed, then added, "I'm kind of a mess now."</p> <p>"I'll leave you to clean up. Are you going to clean up?"</p> <p>"If it's all right, yes."</p> <p>"Good." The two friends cleaned up in relative silence. When they were done, they got in their cars and headed home. When they got home, they stopped in to say 'hello'. They walked outside, took their bags, and went inside, taking turns asking the questions they didn't need answers from their parents.</p> <p>"Is it okay if your father wants to take us to dinner at least once a month?" Sarah asked the other.</p> <p>"Sure," the other replied. "I don't have any reservations about it. I'll wait upstairs for you."</p> <p>"Will we have time for sex?" "Do you think?"</p> <p>"It's all of us."</p> <p>"Will you come on down here with us?" Sarah's mother asked the two.</p> <p>"Yeah, but it might not be too much of a bother." Sarah answered.</p> <p>"It won't be. But," she added, "we'll be careful."</p> <p>Sarah left the other's house and rode to Helen's house. She parked in the lot behind Helen's house, got out of her car, and stepped off inside. Sarah's father and mother followed on an adjacent curb. Once inside, they all got into the back of the family room. Sarah turned the light off and they turned on every light in the house. They made their way to the back corner, where there was an end table to get some snacks. Both of Sarah's parents gave Sarah a hug and a hug, but she kept out of their way. She and Sarah's mother spent some time eating a tray of drinks together. Afterwards they both took their leave.</p> <p>Sarah's mother took her father's hand and said, "It's been such a wonderful month this year for you."</p> <p>"Mom, I know something good is going to come out of it this weekend. You need to stop by the pool this week."</p> <p>"How about Friday?"</p> <p>"I'll be there the whole day."</p> <p>"Will you come get us?" Her mother asked her. With a happy grin, Sarah's mother hugged Sarah.</p> <p>"That's not a problem," the mother said with a grin.</p> <p>"Sarah, you didn't have to go. You already have a date with Jim tonight."</p> <p>Sarah's mother raised her voice. "What about me? I was going to do more with you than that." She said, then added, "And, we're gonna have a lot of fun this week. We can just stay here and pick the right day."</p> <p>The two women looked at each other.</p> <p>Sarah's mother said, "I knew you would be. I can't wait until tomorrow."</p> <p>Sarah's father held her hands for a moment. "You can go. It's not like you have to be on the phone all day."</p> <p>"Thanks, Dad. You don't have to go." Sarah's mother said before she hugged Sarah again.</p> <p>Sarah's mother took her other hand and said, "Come on, come on up to the bedroom. I have to talk to you both about something." Sarah's father shook his head, then asked, "How bad is it?"</p> <p>The two women turned on the TV channel. Sarah told her father it was the perfect idea, but her mother looked at her and pointed a finger at her. She turned to her mother and asked, "Mom, why don't you and I go into the guest room and talk." They both nodded their heads, then they disappeared into the guest room.</p> <p>Sarah's father closed the door behind them then asked her mom, "Sarah honey, what are mom and dad talking about?"</p> <p>"I'm just telling Sarah she's going to be happy. Why don't you both come downstairs and sit down and talk for at least a half hour or so. I want to just hear your mom say it."</p> <p>"Mom?" Sarah's mother asked, her eyes wide.</p> <p>"Oh, my God!" Sarah's mother exclaimed. "I haven't heard one woman giggle in a long time!"</p> <p>Sarah's mother nodded her head as she finished talking.
