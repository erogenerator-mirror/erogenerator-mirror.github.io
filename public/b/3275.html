I asked him.</p> <p>"Yes," my boss replied.</p> <p>I asked him to tell us where he had gone to.</p> <p>Then came a brief answer that he had forgotten.</p> <p>I tried to follow his words in his head but of course he did not take that to mean that I had forgotten it.</p> <p>He then asked me what I thought and I knew that something was up. It was time for me to speak.</p> <p>"I don't want to tell you anything just yet?" I asked.</p> <p>Before he could react I decided to tell him everything about what was on my mind.</p> <p>"I was invited to the parties that have been hosted by the family and my boss. I know that everyone is going but I wanted to share something with you."</p> <p>"You are kidding! We have been at parties like that for the past five months or so and most of the people are not even talking to me."</p> <p>"Nonsense," I said. "They know that I am not here for that. I just wanted you to know that. But when we get to the parties I want you to talk to the people and listen. I love the attention I get from the people around me. I will go to other parties on a regular basis and even have a couple of male guests, but then most of them are guys who have nothing else than great parties. They can only be held while I am there."</p> <p>"So you were asked to attend the parties?" He asked.</p> <p>"Yes and yes and yes of course," I said, "so that is the reason that I was chosen. I am not looking forward to going into the world alone."</p> <p>"Oh no," he laughed. "You are the first person to leave the party after the party has been opened and is totally naked. There are too many naked people present, so I have to say that is not the end of that."</p> <p>"Yes," I said. "I have never been here but I love the attention. But now I am afraid that I will stay in the company of people."</p> <p>"I guess you are right," he said. "But if you want to come, we can go whenever you are comfortable with that."</p> <p>"No that's ok. It is not going to happen, but you could say that it is not so great. Just remember that I am with you forever."</p> <p>"Well, at the start it was just a group of friends, but after the party I think we made friends on a regular basis."</p> <p>"But now you have come to live here as well?" He asked. "That is really nice of you."</p> <p>I blushed and smiled. "Thank you," I sighed. Then I said, "I would still like to go."</p> <p>"Well I am sure that you are ready for this," he said.</p> <p>"Yes, but I am afraid," I replied. "There will be so many people here, not just me."</p> <p>"Let me put this together," he said. "Let's go to a club tonight and we can get acquainted."</p> <p>"I know where," I said.</p> <p>"Let's go here," he suggested.</p> <p>"You can't," I pleaded. "The club is closed. Everyone is home. The people have already decided that it is too far out for them to join the party."</p> <p>"True, but you just went so far as to go out there like that." He explained.</p> <p>"But I am getting a little worried," I insisted.</p> <p>"Well don't worry about that."</p> <p>Then we said our goodbyes and we left. Just minutes after we got to his home, there was a knock at my car door.</p> <p>It was a long two minutes for me to get through the door and then a few seconds to my dismay to find myself face to face with the beautiful Jim again. He had removed all of his clothes but he still made no pretense of it. We had been drinking wine when it started. During the time that we had been drinking we had made out on his living room couch. I started to get excited as he looked at me. He had removed his shirt and his pants were on the floor and I could see that his erect cock was pushing against the fabric of his underwear.</p> <p>He leaned in and kissed me. Not quite a passionate kiss, but almost like kissing a daughter. It was so good!</p> <p>"Hey," I said.
