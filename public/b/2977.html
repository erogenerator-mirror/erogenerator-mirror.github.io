Just as I thought. Did you have a change of heart? I mean, I wasn't upset about it. Really. It's not my place to talk about your sexlife. If you could just explain it to me, I would really understand."</p> <p>"I was, uh, well, you know," she said. "I'm just not sure where to begin. I had a couple of orgasms, but you know how much that means to me. And I just can't tell you why."</p> <p>I was silent for a minute. I could have asked her what she was thinking, but didn't as the feelings welled up in my mouth.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, Dan. I know that you can't understand why I did that. But I guess you could find out, at least a bit. It's not as bad as you think. The problem is that the only way that it's going to happen for us is if you just let me take advantage of it. We both know I can't."</p> <p>"We both know what is going to happen tonight. And I do respect that, I guess. But I really do need to get on with that. You really seem to like me and it will probably be really good."</p> <p>"I guess you're right about that. You seemed rather open to what was going to happen, and well, I was kind of excited about the idea. And I'm not as into sharing myself as you, or any of your friends. I just want you to know that there are other people in my life right now, Dan."</p> <p>"I just have to be sure that this is all a spur of the moment thing. You know there are other girls here?"</p> <p>"Yeah, me included. There are guys here too."</p> <p>"So, you like the idea. That's nice to hear from you. What the heck? Do you really want to do this?"</p> <p>"I'm not saying that I don't want to," I said, not bothering to put a finger on the subject. "But I do like the idea of sharing myself with you without feeling pressured. If it works out, then we can probably just do it."</p> <p>"Okay," she said, a little more cautiously than she had sounded.</p> <p>"But it's still awkward for you," I added.</p> <p>She seemed more relaxed now.</p> <p>"That's a big step for me. And, I still don't really know if it's going to work," I said, again without much conviction.</p> <p>She seemed to understand, but seemed to take a lot of pressure off of me. I just wished that she would leave me alone. It wasn't so much that I was thinking about her, and that I wanted her there. It was more that she was letting me down and making me feel more miserable than I already had.</p> <p>After much consideration and discussion, and a lot of patience, I said, "It's really going to be pretty hard for me to be honest with you. I guess I just wasn't ready to be involved with another girl in that way. I was really kind of excited before."</p> <p>"I understand," she said, leaning forward to kiss and hug me. I wrapped my arm around her waist and pulled her in. "And I guess it'll be a good time too. Just one more thing. If you really need me, can we go to your place and just go to sleep together? I don't think it would be wise."</p> <p>"Sure. There's an apartment about two miles from here. We can drive there together and I am sure we will get a room in the loft," I offered.</p> <p>"I guess it will be more comfortable there without the kids," she said.</p> <p>"We'll just have to be careful," I said. "We'll just do things, and you know it. It may just be awkward for me too. I guess it really depends on how we look at things, especially right now. I mean we are still in the same position. You can just get a room here when we get back."</p> <p>She looked disappointed. I felt a little sorry. I don't suppose there was anyone as young as her.</p> <p>"Just remember, I still love you," she said, and kissed me hard on my lips, right in front of the kids. "Besides, we both know what happens next. Just be sure to let me know if it doesn't work out for you."</p> <p>We got our stuff back and I went home. I wasn't quite sure what to make of the whole situation. At that point I still needed to go to sleep with another woman, and she was probably the only oneâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
