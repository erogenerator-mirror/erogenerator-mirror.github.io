Since it was my own house, it meant that I couldn't help but feel like a normal person; at least when I was on her level.</p> <p>After we ate we moved to a private table where we started the game. As soon as my hand was off of the table, she took my hand, guided me to the nearest chair, and sat me down.</p> <p>"Don't worry about anything. I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself."</p> <p>"I'm not taking care of anything, I just want to watch," I said with a smile.</p> <p>"It's ok. I'm happy with you. I'd much rather do it every night."</p> <p>"Can you be a gentleman, just take the time to enjoy yourself?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Not really. I like being watched, it's a beautiful day, and I want to see your reaction. I just know that's not fair to you. After last night, I don't think you could feel anything for me without being an idiot. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't."</p> <p>I took a deep breath as I placed my hand over hers and pressed it lightly on of mine.</p> <p>"I love you," I told her kissing the top of her head.</p> <p>"I love you too, but you know I can't. I just want to watch."</p> <p>"That's ok. I love you."</p> <p>She put her hand on mine and led it slowly back around to the other side of the table. She put her hand on top of mine and guided it over to her backside. She guided it back around to her pussy before pulling it back and making a little adjustment. When I looked up at her, she winked as I continued to gently stroke her pussy lips. "Your fingers look so good,"</p> <p>"Your pussy feels great," I replied.</p> <p>"And I love your cock."</p> <p>I couldn't help but chuckle.</p> <p>"So does mine. It's been so long that we both love to see it being pulled out of the other's body."</p> <p>"I wouldn't hold it against you," she said as she took my hand and led my fingers to her pussy, pushing them forward and down.</p> <p>"I wouldn't hold anything against you either if I could tell you to do this," I said as I put a second finger inside of her.</p> <p>My fingers began moving in a slow rhythm as I increased my pace. I sawed my fingers in and out in unison with her hand on mine.</p> <p>"Your penis makes my vagina feel so good. I love the feel of your hard cock in me."</p> <p>"I love what you do to me, baby."</p> <p>"Your vagina feels so good, the way you wrap your fingers around my fingers. I hope this is what you want, but I'd love to see you and make you feel good too."</p> <p>"I want to make you feel good, too."</p> <p>"You can talk about anything to me,"</p> <p>"Only about making me feel good."</p> <p>She leaned forward and kissed me quickly, leaving no question in her mind about how good my fingers felt inside of her. She lifted her legs to wrap around my waist as she began to play with my dick, which made my heart sink.</p> <p>"That's it baby, let it go," she whispered.</p> <p>I looked down at her as her hand slowly worked up and down my shaft. Every stroke making it harder and longer.</p> <p>"I'm getting close, give me a sec."</p> <p>As I waited for her to let my cock go, she looked up at me and smiled; holding that smile was enough to make me cum, but not as much as she wanted.</p> <p>"I want to cum in you, do me," she whispered leaning forward and pushing her pussy against my cock. "I want you to make me cum when I cum inside of you."</p> <p>"Ok," I answered as I reached forward and placed one finger on her clit. She lifted her leg up in the seat to allow me better access to her pussy.</p> <p>"Oh god yes. Oh god yes," she cried out as I took her clit into my mouth and gently began to suck on it sending little shivers into her lower bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
