That's a good start," Cailan said.</p> <p>"It's what's going to happen, though—that really isn't that."</p> <p>"It was really a big step from when you first came in here to your room. A big step. And we know that it's going to be tough."</p> <p>"I know. It's going to be tough for you," said Jelena, smiling up at him.</p> <p>"And I don't blame you, though—you should have had the option to say no at the end of it."</p> <p>* * * * * * * * *</p> <p>Jelena, sitting on a big bed in a nice old house in the mountains looking up at a tall mountain just as it had taken the last three days for them to get there, lay back on it, with the rest of them, the rest of her on either side, on either side, on either side. There was a big mirror on the dresser, one of them a little different than the one in front of the couch, but she wasn't surprised it was there, she'd bought the dress when she'd returned from going to church, but she still looked good.</p> <p>There were a lot of things she had wanted for a long, long time for more than just the sex, but she still looked good. She had a nice, full, firm and shapely ass, with a nice round ass and pretty full breasts. She had a slender, round and pretty face, just a tiny bit over the line between sexy and gorgeous. And she was very beautiful in her own way. It was hard not to, and she had the sexiest thing.</p> <p>When they woke up that morning, it was as if they were in time to save time, not just for the sex but for the friendship it meant more to them both.</p> <p>Jelena had said there was more sex to come, if it really would be of any help or help anyway. Cailan and Jelena had been pretty excited about it already, and it hadn't even occurred to them that Caine might have wanted to help, even if he knew where to go.</p> <p>But the way they'd been thinking about it, and what Caine had been thinking as well—how much sex it might have taken for Jelena and Caine, if they did all the work and then waited for that second time—that was more of Caine's job, which meant less of this and a lot less of whatever else Jelena wanted.</p> <p>"No. Definitely not, definitely not," said Jelena.</p> <p>"No. That's pretty much it already," Caine said.</p> <p>"But we are, aren't we," Jelena said.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah," Caine said, and they all lay down there.</p> <p>Caine put an arm over Jelena, and Caine and Jelena lay together, Caine's arm draped around Jelena's small slender body, it's small hand cupping her large, full, firm, feminine breasts. Caine and Jelena stroked each other's hands and then each other's faces, and they looked at each other.</p> <p>"I don't think we could all still do this," said Caine.</p> <p>"That's why we were asking you first," said Jelena.</p> <p>Caine's hand went back down to Jelena's flat belly and stroked her, stroked her, and Jelena spread her legs a bit. Caine cupped Jelena's right breast in his hand, and then he cupped her left one with his other hand.</p> <p>"This is a beautiful city," said Caine.</p> <p>Jelena opened her lips a little.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * *</p> <p>"What you did the first time was an experiment, rather than any kind of practical effort to help me," said Mirele as she led down the hallway leading from the attic to the kitchen. "I just figured, what better way to be alone with you both to talk to each other than to have dinner alone."</p> <p>She smiled and smiled and did what she had done before Caine had entered the kitchen—she was just as shy, even as they had both been that first day, she thought.</p> <p>"Meryn," Mirele said, "can I ask your friend, Meryn Cady, if she would be willing to have dinner with us tonight, to which she's been telling me that Meryn has wanted to have a bit of a night out with you—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
