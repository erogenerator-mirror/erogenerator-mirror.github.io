Alex felt himself begin to harden again. This was the most delicious feeling she'd ever felt. She ran her hands over his muscular chest, his ripples and flexes in his powerful shoulders and chest. His cock and balls were swollen beyond any doubt. He was so smooth and strong. Alex had just about gotten to the point where she wanted all her senses stimulated at once. She was ready to have him take her any way he wanted. She wanted to feel that big hard cock of his pounding her with his strong hands and slamming her like a wild thing. She loved that she could have him at her place for ever. She wanted him inside her every minute.</p> <p>He stroked her face more, the gentle caress of his fingers against her skin soft and smooth. His hand slid lower, brushing her collarbone, down to the small valley of her breasts. He cupped her soft breasts with his hand, sliding his fingers across her nipples which stood up stiff. She had such a tiny, delicate, round pair. Alex groaned when his fingers stroked both nipples, pushing the tiny nubs out.</p> <p>She bit her lip as his fingertips stroked and pinched her nipples, causing her eyes to roll up into the back of her head. Her arousal was growing. Her legs began to shake as she moved her body, his hand still cupping her tender breasts while his hand stroked her soft flesh, squeezing her lightly. She moaned again as his hand stroked up to stroke her belly, then to stroke her lower stomach. Then slowly slid lower until his finger had slipped between her thighs. He could feel her moist heat from just a touch, his finger teasing her outer labia before delving into her wetness. She began to grind against his fingers, her sex dripping onto his finger.</p> <p>Alex arched her back and bit her lip as his finger plunged deep into her swollen flesh, slowly pressing inside her. He could feel her hot wetness as she slid her wet fingers through his curls, teasing his lips, her nails. He stroked his finger slowly, circling her swollen clit at the top of her slit before slipping a second finger into her hole. His thumb gently caressed her wet entrance, pressing up between her slippery lips until she gave a little mewl of ecstasy with each stroke.</p> <p>"Come on," he murmured, pulling his fingers from her pussy. She was wet and slippery from her own arousal and the stimulation from his touch. He slipped his finger from her hand and she began to pant. "Come, Alex. Please."</p> <p>He took her hand between his and pressed it against his cock. She stroked him as she reached to feel the hard tip, her wet hand enveloping him firmly. "Come here," he said, and she followed his command. He held her against him, one arm wrapped around her back, another hand caressing the sensitive skin above his shaft. She leaned back against him, his fingers pressing up against the bottom of her clit, the hardness pressing into her flesh. She groaned softly as her body began to shake, almost imperceptibly, her need overriding her will.</p> <p>He stroked the underside of her chin with his finger as her hand worked the base of his cock, sliding its way to cup the warm, smooth flesh. His thumb stroked the small, erect clitoral bud as her other hand stroked him eagerly. His thumb slipped from her clit to press into her opening while his fingers stroked a second finger into her soft, wetness. She began to moan softly as her fingers found his erection, encircling the swollen flesh and gently pushing down toward him. Alex's body trembled as his fingers slid deeper into her wetness. Her mouth hung open, her eyes closed. Her knees pressed up against her chest with each stroke from her fingers. His hands held her in place as she reached to the bedside table to retrieve their toys.</p> <p>"Lie here," he said, his fingers spreading her cheeks. Alex watched his fingers open her tenderness and dip into her cunt. She was dripping wet and her body was shaking. He pushed her thighs farther apart with his free hand as she watched avidly as his fingers continued to caress her ass. Their eyes locked as he leaned down to her exposed opening and slowly pressed the tip of his tongue into her hole.</p> <p>Alex moaned softly as his tongue slid across her clit, then sucked it gently between his lips. A gasp escaped her lips at his tongue. His tongue began to lap at her hole with little circles, pushing deeper in her hole. She arched her back as her fingers clenched his hairâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
