And she gave me a quick kiss on the cheek as she left.</p> <p>I went home and spent the rest of the evening reading through the stories on line. At about seven in the morning I had to stop and call her cell. I picked up the phone and answered it. "Hi, I know you had to go. How are things going?"</p> <p>"I'm doing ok," I told her "just thinking about another night out"</p> <p>"Well," she said, "I'll be in touch. I should be back in about an hour then."</p> <p>I hung up the phone and got a shower, packed a bag and went out to the beach. I put on my flip-top and headed out to the beach. I found out why Mom had packed a picnic basket of stuff at home. It was a long ride down to the nearest barber shop, but there was plenty of beach and lots of shade.</p> <p>I headed back to my cabin, where I knew I was expected to find some work to get done. As it turned out I started looking for a job right off the line. I stopped at a convenience store on the way and got some things for supper, and spent the first half hour working out some of my fitness routine on the treadmill. Since I had just turned forty I figured I could get a couple hundred dollars or two each, which I was looking forward to do. As the minutes had passed I began to catch the occasional glimpse of my Mom's legs. I was beginning to look forward to seeing her more often.</p> <p>About mid-afternoon I was looking into the fridge and found the right kind of soda. I figured when Mom got home she might be wearing her workout shorts over her workout pants. It was the summer heat and the shorts would keep their heat in and stay firm enough after the workout to keep in shape for the summer. I decided to go ahead and take a long hot shower, after which I grabbed my towel and went to get dressed for my day away tomorrow. When I got downstairs I was startled to see everyone at the table.</p> <p>"Hey Mom," I said, "have you seen your dad?"</p> <p>"Uh, yeah," she said, smiling at me, "he's been gone for two days. He's in town on business."</p> <p>"Is he coming home?" I asked. "That's okay, is it?"</p> <p>"Well, no," she said, "but I've called my friends and we could go for a couple of drinks and get a few more things for dinner tonight."</p> <p>"We've got a few drinks and a bunch of food to cook, " I told her, "and you know what those things are?"</p> <p>"No, what do you know," she said, "I'm not a hooker. I'm an ordinary college student working for a job on a farm."</p> <p>"What," I asked, "are you going to do for a couple of hours then?"</p> <p>"No, not like right now," she said, "I want to find a good job and get my head down."</p> <p>I was pretty taken. "Come on over tomorrow. Let's go and spend our night" and I said, "that's great, too."</p> <p>"No, no, no. Don't go," she said, "please come with me."</p> <p>"Fine," I said, "if it is what you want."</p> <p>"Come on, we're going to have some fun," she said, "we're going too. What kind of fun might that be?"</p> <p>"You don't think we need a couple of drinks and an expensive restaurant and a couple of cheap cigars?"</p> <p>"Well, I don't even know what those are," she said as she picked up her purse and took out her cell, "there's one thing we always used when we got together."</p> <p>I looked at her and said, "So, you ever try to use your cell? Like, really use it?"</p> <p>She laughed and said, "You'll just have to be quiet about it."</p> <p>We went to town for a couple of drinks and a couple of the meals. I was sure we could get away with just a few drinks if I put my foot down enough. But I did some thinking and gave up.</p> <p>"So, have he had any offers?" she asked, "any plans when he does?"</p> <p>"None," I replied, "so this might have something to do with my cell," I thought.</p> <p>"So, is he married?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don't know he's married," I replied, "he had his own place."</p> <p>"What is married," she asked.</p> <p>"Well, some sort of convention," I saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
