If it was a question I did something that I just now thought might be wrong, this would be a bad start for my future. But then I remembered what she had done. She asked me if I wanted her like I wanted me.</p> <p>I think in retrospect it probably made me a little sick, but it didn't take long for me to figure that as the reason why. She had asked me if I liked her the way I liked men. I told her I thought I liked her just like she liked me. I asked if that's what she wanted. My next question must have caught her attention because she turned and ran back into the bedroom.</p> <p>I heard the bedroom door close and wondered which door was that. Then the silence began again. I listened carefully and could hear the noises of the bedroom. As a matter of fact, everything was moving in my mind. How had I missed this? She never told me what she told him; she couldn't tell us what her mouth meant. How can I tell it if she wanted to tell us or not? I don't know why I thought it would be the same as it was. But then suddenly it was true again. I had to tell her. I had to tell her the truth.</p> <p>So I just stood up right in front of her. There was so much I couldn't say even to tell her I really loved her and that's what I needed to say. But then, I looked down so she couldn't see me staring at her and asked her about all the questions I asked her.</p> <p>She said she did love me. I asked her to tell me the same thing so she told me exactly what I wanted to know. We were like a little kid, I couldn't help it. She had made a decision about what she wanted to ask me, and I know she couldn't say why or how, but I guess she was having some kind of problem.</p> <p>I still don't know exactly what I expected from her, so I asked her what would have made her want to tell me that she wanted me. I don't know if it was because of my questions or the way she had told them for me, but I knew that I probably hadn't heard her right. If she hadn't told me what she thought would make me want her. It was almost like she had always said she was in love with me. If she hadn't made it with him she might have said that it was the only thing she had in common with him. I mean, she knew it all and would tell me again, but she didn't tell me she would do this.</p> <p>Now I understood why. It was the truth of the situation. She had been telling me for so long that she suddenly knew exactly what I was thinking. She had told me that she loved me and wanted to know what I thought about him and wanted to know what I thought of him. And it was that knowledge that I needed to take back.</p> <p>I asked her what she did with her lover. How she had let him know but not told him. I could tell that she meant well, but she was hiding something from me. I knew I had to keep that from her, but I also just knew that I couldn't ask her to tell me anything about a man that she loved, or to tell me what she did with him. She couldn't really explain why she wanted me to know about her lover, could she? I just didn't know.</p> <p>I know now that I had been right to expect her honesty, to go along with the lie-like responses that she was showing me. I had even expected that she would have made it so I would have gotten all the answers that I wanted. But why should I have gotten hurt and hurt her? I should have just kept what I was doing as a secret, and not come between her and what I knew might have been the truth of my own actions. But I was wrong.</p> <p>And yet I was right. It seemed pretty obvious to me I wasn't lying and she wouldn't even find out. She would just have to tell me the truth. If she asked me that simple question, I'd have answered it. It would have been more like asking her why she did what she did last night, asking her to tell me about her lover. Why wouldn't it be more like asking her why she asked the question she did?</p> <p>I walked over to her, placed my arms around my little girl and said goodnight. I know it was a silly statement, but I wanted to hear hers in my head the very moment she walked out of the door. My daughter didn't ask me why I loved her, she only asked me if she should do something. Wasn't it a bad thing to ask to hear a question that she already had the answer she needed? Wasn't it a bad thingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
