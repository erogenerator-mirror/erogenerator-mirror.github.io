I would think her husband is going to see something like this."</p> <p>"Let's just say that I've done research on my own, and I'm sure of the answer," I responded.</p> <p>"Well, I'm sure you'd like some answers," I joked, then added, "But what makes you think she's been in the area of checking on me?"</p> <p>"Oh, well, nothing to do with you," I replied quickly, hoping we could finally work things out.</p> <p>"Not sure the point is that, if she was in the area, well, there's a pretty big risk I wouldn't know where to look, except for some places to look. Or to ask something like, why she's been in the area?" he pondered out loud, while still trying to figure out how she might have gotten such a large piece of information.</p> <p>"Well, you've probably just been gone," I said, and laughed as we turned around.</p> <p>"Well, yes, and no. But you can always come back tomorrow and get some more data if you want," he smiled, as he held his hand over the top of the cup, which had fallen a little.</p> <p>"Well, thanks. This was definitely informative," I replied, as he put the cap back on.</p> <p>"Well, you can't tell just yet," he said, "There's really nothing for everyone to make or anything, but you can always go to a doctor to see if they had something new for you or if your doctor isn't home this morning."</p> <p>"Thanks, I appreciate that."</p> <p>"So, just to let you know, but we won't do anything for her." he smiled at me, as he took my hand and walked me right to the end of the hall.</p> <p>He opened the door to the hallway and led me down the hallway back towards my bedroom. "Well," he said, "you're in luck, because it's the doctor. I've been in the hallway for a little while and have to leave. I'm headed back down to the office as I was telling you. I just took an extra day off today, so I've got a couple things I need to show you."</p> <p>"So, you're still not back yet? You're leaving early for a few days, right?" I asked. He just sighed and shook his head, and I knew something was going on between us. "I'm sorry to keep you waiting, but I really just can't stand to be around you for very long," I said, as I walked up beside him.</p> <p>"Well, I haven't been waiting that long and have been spending way more time with my girlfriends than they're doing on me," he said, "Let me just let you out first, before you go."</p> <p>"I can wait," I responded. "Let me know when you're ready, okay? I'll keep it inside my head, okay?"</p> <p>"Thank you," he said, as he started walking away.</p> <p>Before I could even knock on the door, a couple of minutes later, the doors of the other two offices swung open with a loud bang. I looked over to see her on about to start walking towards me, while she was holding her purse up proudly. When she saw me standing there, she smiled. "I know you can't come in the office like that," she said, while giving me a very sexy smile before she started walking past me, "I just wanted to surprise you."</p> <p>"Well thank you," I said, as I shook her hand. They both looked over my other half, while I saw them both in casual conversation for a little more than a minute. As they left, I walked over to the couch that was in the guest room, and sat down with my back to the door, while waiting for the doctor. She came in after a few minutes, and sat down next to me.</p> <p>"You have such a beautiful home," she said, after she looked right in my eyes and began to kiss me again.</p> <p>"Thank you," I answered, before she pulled my head down and kissed me some more.</p> <p>A few minutes later, we started to make out again, in her bedroom. This time, I pulled my sweater up and pulled her sweater out of her skirt. While she was in the process of removing my sweater, I grabbed the bottom of her shirt and slowly pulled it up so that we could kiss some more. She let out a very loud moan while I did so, and I didn't even have to do much of anything as they started kissing again.
