How?"</p> <p>"I used a lot of it up here."</p> <p>"Didn't you use a lot of shit on 'em?"</p> <p>"Yeah, me too. I had them turn in every day. Then I would fuck the crap out of them. Like last night, they were all so fucked up."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"I fucked them. Like last night, I didn't even have to do my own cooking so I fucked everyone that fucked them."</p> <p>"What?!"</p> <p>I could tell that my sister was going to kick me in the balls. "Shut up, Sis! That's not the fucking subject in this conversation!"</p> <p>"Oh, but what is it? I'm not even gonna tell you."</p> <p>"Not unless you want me to. Tell me."</p> <p>"You can't do this, you know. I don' c..C"</p> <p>"But why?"</p> <p>"Because you know? Because you know I'm not."</p> <p>"Are you making fun of me? That's a compliment, bro. What's funny is that you aren't funny. I didn't mean to be gross, it just slipped my mind."</p> <p>"No, you had something to do with it."</p> <p>"Just make up some bullshit."</p> <p>"I didn't mean to tell you anything, and maybe just because you're my sister, but it just slipped my mind." I tried to put an end to her nonsense, but as long as she gave me space to argue, I was sure that my temper would be an old trick. I decided that this was better than talking about it to her, or to all of us, because I would have to do it myself. After all, I had made her think about what she had just implied to me, and I was no more inclined to argue with her. So I did it.</p> <p>"Fine," I finally managed to say. "Fine. What? I'll tell you whatever you want, but, if either you see anything at all, you just shut up. Okay?"</p> <p>"You can't do that," my sister said. "You don't talk like that on our front porch, and I don't even have your bedroom. You can't do it on the front porch. That's just disgusting."</p> <p>"I don't know what you're talking about. I think you're trying to break me out of my motherfucking chastity device."</p> <p>"Come on," her brother added, "you know he'll try to catch you. That is, if you don't tell him to shut his damn mouth."</p> <p>"He won't if I lie to him." I had never seen my friend cry before, and I knew that was just because it was the first time it happened.</p> <p>"You know what else you're talking about?"</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"You know what else you're talking about, and the reason you're all jealous is that your sister has me in a chastity cage. And my brother has you chained up."</p> <p>She just stared at me. I decided it was time to shut the fuck up. "No, you're right. I'll tell you what, dude. I want you to go upstairs to my room and unlock it. I'll be at the front door waiting for you."</p> <p>"Well, don't forget the key," he said. "He'll have to have some ID to get in there. And no, no, let him unlock the cage too."</p> <p>As soon as I said it, I couldn't help but agree with the logic of it. All of us knew that if the subject of this new development got a little carried away, I might be able to get rid of her for the day. She couldn't possibly be all that upset about the way I looked at her on the inside, but if she went off with whoever it was, the only thing I felt was a pang of guilt for her. So I did as he asked, and locked myself out so she would be unable to do so.</p> <p>I went upstairs, and turned on my old light. There wasn't much illumination in the dim room, but there was enough to make it nice. So I locked my own door, and sat on my bed. I looked up at my ceiling, and couldn't help but feel that I knew this was going to be as hard as it was going to be.</p> <p>"Where were we?" my sister looked over at me from the bottom of my bed, and I didn't answer her. "Where are you going? Tell me what's going on. Tell me what's the issue with this whole crazy ideaâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
