You know I'm a virgin, right? I mean, I don't usually go that far with the guys I date, but I can sure as heck go for it sometimes.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I just thought it might be okay.</p> <p>Well, maybe I would have thought differently. Actually, he is kind of cute. He's got a great ass, and he's got some nice legs and a smile!</p> <p>"What? Really? How? Tell me more about him!</p> <p>"Well, he's young and pretty good looking, and he likes me to flirt with him while I'm working."</p> <p>"Do you know anything about this older guy? If you do, tell me," I said.</p> <p>Darrin smiled and said, "Well, I saw him on his way here. I was surprised to see him at the same time."</p> <p>I said, "He really is pretty. And he was very good-looking, too. He's about the same age as you, isn't he?"</p> <p>Darrin grinned and said, "Yeah, he's very well-looking, too. So what do you think about those old guys? He's really cute, maybe a little older than you. The guy really likes it when I flirt with him." He held up his hand and said, "Come on, I haven't been flirting with anyone else, and I'm sure that you'd like another turn." He gestured toward the bar.</p> <p>"What guy? No way! What's going on? I'm sure I don't want to hear the story of a college friend who's getting what I want, but I don't want them to think I'm a bad girl."</p> <p>Darrin grinned and said, "You'll see. Let me get his number, and we can go check this out." With that, Darrin was off.</p> <p>I took him right along the bar, and when he got there, he pulled a business card out of his pocket. "This isn't exactly a business card, but this is nice to look at," he said when he came up next to me. "I'm Darrin. I'm a junior at the University of Maine at U of M. I'd like to join the Marines with some friends some day."</p> <p>"No, I don't want some other guy, just you," I said. "Why don't we get a drink? I'm not going to leave, and I'm sure he appreciates that, but I was hoping he wouldn't mind if we just ordered drinks?"</p> <p>He took my hand and smiled. "I wouldn't mind, but I'm a little afraid. I'm a pretty big guy and have a lot of muscles. I just hope it doesn't burn my wrists or anything."</p> <p>"Not a problem, I'll take it," I said. "So, are you ready to go again, or did you decide to stay another night or something?"</p> <p>"Oh, no, I'm just not that interested in any of the guys and certainly not any of the girls, and what guy wouldn't want to watch you flirting with someone?" Darrin said. "Not that I am complaining. I'm not that much into flirting and I can't wait to show you a nice cock! It'd be so cool if the guy were my girlfriend!"</p> <p>We had downed more than a couple of rounds before Darrin picked up the drinks and walked us back to the table so his and the man's attention could be easily seen! And this time, Darrin got up and walked over to me as well.</p> <p>"What's he like and doesn't he have a penis?"</p> <p>"He doesn't have a penis," I said. "And I haven't even seen a nice cock in my time. It's about time we got a look at it. I'll bet he's only seven inches and he doesn't have any pubic hair. How about you?"</p> <p>"Six, I think," Darrin said, and then said "Six and a half inches, I think." Then, looking around the bar, when Darrin got to me, he said, "I can imagine if the guy ever really had a nice cock!"</p> <p>I started to laugh and said, "Oh, no, you don't have a nice cock. It's my boyfriend, I guess."</p> <p>"Well, he's pretty well equipped too, he says," Darrin said, and then said "Hey, why don't you show me your girlfriend? I mean, it'll be interesting to see what kind of effect that would have on the guy!"</p> <p>That caused us a lot of giggling and I said, "Wellâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
