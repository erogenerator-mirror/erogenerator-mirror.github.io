She was rubbing, lifting them up and squeezing them and pushing into me. She held them up and pulled back to rub and squeeze them and squeeze. They were swollen and I could feel the pressure on them. I leaned into her and whispered to her, "Keep those eyes still. Don't want you to cum too soon."</p> <p>I felt her fingers on the back of my dick, stroking up and down and pulling the skin back and forth and twisting around my dick. I was so sensitive after the first shot in my dick and the pressure was building. She started to run her other hand down around my balls and was teasing and rubbing the head and shaft of my cock with her fingers, feeling the pre-cum start to drip down the head of my dick. My hips started thrusting, wanting to plunge into her hand and then she let go and rubbed the rest of the cum into my balls. It had been a long time since I had cum and I was desperate to shoot and I felt myself ready for release but could not. I felt my legs trembling and the tension building in my body until I could stand it no longer and I shot four strong spurts straight at her tits. My head went back and my hips started bucking and I was shaking hard and moaning as I came. She let up some and I just let go and shot all four jets of hot cum deep inside her.</p> <p>She just leaned on my leg and we stayed there. Her tits were still hard as they got up off my lap and she rubbed her tits over them squeezing as she looked at them and said, "They're gorgeous."</p> <p>"Yeah my dick got all floppy, I can't believe I did that. This is just the first day of our new relationship. If you ever want to do this again, I'll be happy to keep in touch." I replied.</p> <p>She leaned her body on mine and held on to me a good bit and we both drifted off to sleepâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
