I walked into the family room and saw Mary. "Good morning, Honey," I said, "How are you today? Does everyone have a good day?"</p> <p>Mary smiled. We talked about her day and the school she had been in. I told her I also wanted to see if we could afford for her to come to the pool on another Saturday so we could go swimming. She agreed and we went back into the house to get some things for breakfast. When we got back to the house all the kids and my wife were already there. The pool girl was still lying down, though it looked much better. Mary introduced me to her, making a couple of comments about her appearance. She even complimented the fact that she had become such a good volleyball player and she really had a great tan.</p> <p>Her name was Kelly. We talked some more and I told her about Mary and what we had talked about last night. She asked me if I was happy to come to the pool with her and I said yes. We kissed and got things on from the kitchen. Mary suggested we get our swim suits on and then went downstairs to change. While Mary and I changed I got one of the suits that Kelly had brought. I looked pretty good, but I thought I looked pretty damn good. It showed off my big tits, but I thought I looked even better than I had on yesterday.</p> <p>Kelly and I started the pool again in the new suit. I took it off and threw it in the back, leaving it on until my swim suit got wet. As I was changing I stopped in the basement rec room, looking inside. Kelly was still naked and she turned to Kelly and they kissed. I quickly went back in and changed back as Kelly grabbed her suit and quickly changed back out. We both went down to the swimming pool and sat around as other people gathered around the table.</p> <p>About an hour later Kelly and I walked back into the rec room, talking a little. Just as we were leaving she said, "Why does everyone know that you have a new bathing suit?" She was dressed in a one-piece bikini. She was really good looking.</p> <p>"I think it is time for me to come home," I told Kelly. "I need to get a shower and change. I really have a lot of work to do."</p> <p>Kelly laughed and said, "I've got it done already. That is what friends are for. You must be getting ready."</p> <p>I looked at her and said, "Oh, yeah, that's right. I'll catch you later. I have to go. Do you do that often?"</p> <p>"Why, of course! What am I looking forward to."</p> <p>When we got back to the house, we all went back up on deck and sat out on one of the deck lounges. We relaxed and talked a little when we got up. We talked about the various things I had been doing over the last two weeks. The topic drifted to school and how she started and how she liked it. Her comments became more personal. She kept asking if I was going to be able to be a cheerleader and I said I wanted to try and do anything else I could.</p> <p>For her part, Kelly was doing a little better than I did so I gave her something I usually do and she did it. I took her back up to the house with me after our swim before we left for the pool. We got some stuff from the house down stairs and then went into our backyard. We had been talking most of the day and had moved upstairs to the pool area of the house. We did not get much sleep that night so I asked Kelly if she wanted to go down to the back of the house and do some swimming.</p> <p>She agreed and went away. When we got back down to the pool she walked up to the grill and made a couple of sandwiches for all of us. She came over to the outdoor bar and joined me for a couple of beers. It was about three in the afternoon when we were all starting that heat in the pool and I was feeling tired. Kelly and I decided to get another cold glass of wine when we finished that last bottle we'd had. About half an hour later both Kelly and I were feeling pretty good and we went in to our rooms to put our clothes on.</p> <p>We were sitting around talking when Mary came back from the kitchen. She was wearing that black, one-piece bikini that really showed off her body. She looked fantastic in it. She had on some white thigh high boots and was sitting on the deck chair. It was her favorite looking outfit to wear around the pool in some of the other outfits I had her do.</p> <p>She looked great and I could not control myself.</p> <p>"Hi," I said.
