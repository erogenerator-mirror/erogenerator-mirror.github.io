He looked down at her body and her legs. Her breasts were big with long red nipples. He licked her lips and his eyes watched. She smiled at him and he felt her wetness again. He lifted her pussy to his waiting mouth and he sucked her. The warmth and heat filled him again. He knew this time would bring him so much and he would love it to bring her too. He licked her hard and she moaned. They moved in a perfect triangle kissing one another. He began to kiss the creases of her neck. His lips covered her breast and he found her nipple and sucked it into his mouth</p> <p>She felt his cock harden against her and she moved her hips against him. She reached for his cock and felt it stiffen against her. He stopped and she begged, "Slow, please."</p> <p>He smiled and gently rubbed the head of his cock with her wetness. She moaned her need again. He slid back into her slowly and she arched her back. He entered her smoothly and she groaned. He pushed deeper then pulled out only to start again. She reached to him and they caressed each other.</p> <p>The waves of pleasure moved against one each other causing them to gasp and scream. Finally they began to quiver. Her orgasm erupted then he collapsed on her. He continued to lay down and she held a thigh over his and they hugged and kissed. He rolled over and they kissed and whispered and held each other. It took just a few minutes to gather her clothes and clean them. They dressed and the kiss was over. They went outside and watched a storm hit from the beach.</p> <p>He looked at her and she reached up and rubbed his lips. "See you for the next weekend?"</p> <p>"You bet." When they finally kissed and got dressed he walked her to her car.</p> <p><^,,>â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
