My voice dropped to a whisper and I closed my eyes, reveling in the pleasure. "I know another of us could use a good massage." My pussy spasmed at the thought, the one I'd been dreaming of for weeks. The thought of this tall gorgeous man's hands on my body stirred my passions in a way no one has ever done before. The thought of him pressing his hard cock deep inside my pussy caused a flood to leak out, creating a void of longing. He slowly lowered his head to mine, as his hands started to move down to my ass. His thumb made the contact against my anus, sliding up and down through the slickness of my pussy from my clitoris to my swollen pussy lips as he lowered down towards me.</p> <p>"Oh God yes. Touch me." He whispered in my ear. His tongue slipped inside my ear and he started to lick along the line between my ear and my neck. I reached out for more of his head. I could feel his chest against my breasts and suddenly my hand found his hard cock, running through his pubic hair and into the warmth of his lap. His hands were on my breasts again, the palm of his hand gently pressing against my nipples.</p> <p>"Is your pussy wet?" His voice was soft.</p> <p>"Yesssss." I cooed as he stroked the outside of my pussy lips with his fingers. "You have such a nice cock, Peter." His voice held a tinge of frustration as he spoke of his own cock in mind. I could tell that a part of it was the ache that filled my being. I wanted what he felt. I wanted to be made to feel desired and loved. I wanted to feel wanted, desired, loved. With an eager grin I said, "It is a good thing we have room to do that in our next room, because I am so glad we are alone."</p> <p>I rolled up on his body and slid my legs across his, pressing myself firmly against him. He wrapped his arms around me and we kissed, tongues dancing in each others mouths. His hands slipped up under my top and massaged my breasts, pinching and gently pulling on my nipples as we moved our bodies against one another.</p> <p>"Oh my." He moaned against my lips.</p> <p>He kissed me once more and moved his hand down and under my skirt. My pussy tingled as he lightly played with my clit. He stopped before he touched my pussy and moved back up to my face. He smiled again at my lust filled eyes. "Let me get comfortable." His face was level with mine, his lips inches from my own.</p> <p>He kissed me again, our mouths opening again to each other. I ran my hand down his chest as his hand caressed my breast again, this time his fingers circled my nipple. It stiffened underneath his touch and I felt his other hand begin to caress my other nipple, one hand caressing the other one.</p> <p>I ran my fingers through his silky auburn hair as our lips parted more. I wanted him to pull my top off and have me take it off, I wanted to taste his mouth. He released my nipple with his mouth and slowly kissed his way down to my navel. Slowly but surely, his kisses went to the top of my thigh, kissing his way back upward to my groin. He kissed again, leaving my sex aching for him to touch. His hands went to my ass. He pulled my knees up into the air, spreading my legs wide open so he could better access to my pussy.</p> <p>"Are you ready for that massage I ordered?" I felt my nipples throbbing and my pussy becoming damp. My eyes fluttered closed as he kissed, licked and nibbled his way up my thighs, never quite touching my pussy, but always teasing it in the most exciting ways. He gently kissed my right thigh before finally starting the massage he started before me. "You are so sexy." My words had no substance of meaning behind them, but they conveyed to me that I was the object of his lust and that he was giving pleasure to me. Peter slowly worked his way up my thigh, his hands caressing my buttocks. My legs opened wider to invite his access. When he finally reached my pussy lips, he paused. "Are you ready for that massage?" He said with a sly smile on his lips.</p> <p>When I nodded my consent I felt his tongue on the outer lips, starting at my knees. He licked my outer lips, pushing his tongue into my open hole. I moaned as he slowly tongue fucked my pussy and clit with his tongue. I lifted my knees up to make it easier for him to lick my pussy, which was dripping. His tongue teased my clit, flicking and nibbling on it slowly, while his two hands strokedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
