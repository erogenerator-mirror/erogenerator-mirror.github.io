He tried to think of the perfect picture she would have in his head, but there was no doubt that the moment was destined to be...a moment between his eyes, a moment where he'd have to be a part of the perfect moment.</p> <p>"You like?"</p> <p>She stepped forward more and wrapped her arms, resting her hands on his chest. Her breasts, she realized, were barely a handful, and she'd only covered them a little to accentuate the size of her tits, the rest she covered just enough to feel as if Jason was still naked. Her nipples tautened against the fabric, almost like pencil erasers against the taut fabric.</p> <p>He didn't say anything; he just stared at her. Jason had just made love to his wife in his office, in his house. The feeling of anticipation mixed with the rush of wanting to pull back just a little bit was so strong, but it wasn't exactly something it was supposed to be.</p> <p>"You know, you're the most perfect man a woman could ever be and it would have been easy to get married without trying. Now...you do it." she said it with a little laugh in her voice, but she couldn't stop it even if she wanted to.</p> <p>"It would have been easy to do. It was a miracle you ever did!" Jason was so caught up in all of that he might have missed the fact that she had a big, swollen, almost menacing, nipple on the other side of the room.</p> <p>"Well, you didn't have to have been around...oh shit...we never could have done it. That's not a very good place to start a marriage." The excitement in her voice was clearly heard. He felt it. This was it. This was the moment he'd been waiting on for the last two years: the moment when he would be truly in her debt.</p> <p>"I guess it makes sense you asked because I didn't answer. Did you like it? It was hard to imagine what might have happened between us if...if it did, doesn't it?" The smile that spread across her face as she said this brought Jason back to the moment.</p> <p>"No, I'm not going to be here for another 20 minutes, I'm going to have a long flight in a couple of days and then I'll get this trip off the ground."</p> <p>"Well, I guess it is time for you to get some real freedom and make a very big impression on women, that you already saw a half dozen times. I'm sure if I wasn't so tired it wouldn't even matter. If you were really tired you could probably sleep in a bed for at least a couple of hours." She knew he already had thoughts of sleeping in her bed, that she was about to sleep in a bed where she wouldn't actually be naked during the day, but if that was the case she certainly wasn't.</p> <p>Jason couldn't think of anything to say, just to see that she'd say yes, and he knew then, there would be no further debate. He'd already made his decision—and for what? He really liked her, as he knew his wife. But, in return for not leaving her body he'd made it clear in his office that he would do anything she asked. Even if she refused him anything. And in any case she never got back home until the next day.</p> <p>She stepped back and began undressing. Before he knew it she was completely naked, but before he could move he'd moved to the floor and was pulling her up into his arms. He kissed her again as he carried her into the bedroom.</p> <p>"I'll make you a deal, if I get to sleep with someone else tonight you'll stay." his hands moved all over her body just as quickly as she'd held them and he was practically on top of her, kissing her passionately. "I won't know if..."</p> <p>"What do you mean, 'if' and 'not' while you're..." Jason just stared into her eyes until he saw fear there in them, but he also saw excitement as well. He saw the fear in his eyes...a way of a man who knew he would never be able to resist any woman in his life.</p> <p>She saw desire in his eyes and knew he'd given himself totally to her. "Please, Jason, please..."</p> <p>"I...I could never..."</p> <p>"I know this means you're going to be uncomfortable sleeping in someone else's, but I can promise you that I won't leave you alone, even if you really don't know where you're going with that. You can be in a bed." She pulled her legs up and reached down between her legs as Jason pulled her tight into his arms. "It won't be unpleasant. I'll come by and pick you up—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
