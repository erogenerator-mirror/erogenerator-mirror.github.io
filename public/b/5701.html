I was surprised to hear myself say that. I guess after I had been with the other women, I still hadn't gotten what she had as my first encounter . I'd been so embarrassed at what I had done, I might as well say it.</p> <p>"My pleasure."</p> <p>I felt an inner glow about her response, the truth. Now as she looked me over, "You're pretty good at it, I can easily see why you liked it," she added.</p> <p>She came to a stop at the other door and opened it to take someone in her bedroom for me to suck on.</p> <p>I looked at her and she said, "I bet your roommate was happy to see you go." I wasn't able to answer that, but the image I saw in my mind. It seemed I was still a virgin, or maybe I had been that often. I felt my cock starting to harden and I started to push the door open.</p> <p>"No, you're going to be my new 'boyfriend' tonight, aren't you?" she said.</p> <p>I took a deep breath, "Yes."</p> <p>"It's hard, isn't it?" she added. "When was the last time you were with a woman?"</p> <p>"Yesterday, it was my senior year."</p> <p>"How old are you?" she asked, again.</p> <p>"18, why?"</p> <p>"Well after our first encounter, you just became my boyfriend."</p> <p>"Oh that was wonderful!" she said, reaching for her bra and throwing it on the floor and turning toward me. Her bra was so light and cool it actually felt cool to my skin. I stood in front of her wearing nothing. It felt so damn good feeling her body against mine as she walked. I wanted her to wrap her arms around me and hold me for a few minutes as I kissed at her neck. I wanted to look her in the eyes for hours, to see if she really felt like I did. I didn't want her to have to explain why I shouldn't feel like that.</p> <p>"Don't take long, I want you to watch me!" she responded as she slowly dropped to her knees. She grabbed my cock in her hands and began to lead me by it toward the bed. She gently laid me on the bed and crawled up between my legs and started rubbing and kissing my chest. I felt her fingers running through my chest hair as she pulled her lips to mine again and we kissed as we gently began to kiss again.</p> <p>She stopped and looked at me for a moment, then looked me over as she gently pushed her head on my chest and began to kiss my stomach to my pubes as she continued to kiss it's way up to my pubes. I looked down to see her soft lips starting to make their way to my balls. I looked down again at the sight of her beautiful face looking up at me while she kissed and kissed my balls. Her lips and tongue continued to slowly slide down my body. I could feel her hands rubbing my thighs and as she kissed the inside of each of my legs.</p> <p>She slowly lifted my legs up off the bed and gently began to kiss the inside of my thighs. I felt like I was floating around the room on a cloud as she started to kiss my soft lips again. When she started kissing my lips again, I leaned into her for one of the greatest and most sensuous kisses I had ever paid her. She looked up at me and then moved back down with her kisses, again kissing my lips.</p> <p>I felt like I couldn't believe what she was doing to me. I knew I was going to cum in less than thirty seconds! I felt like she was moving up and down my body, kissing every inch or more on her way up my legs. She looked at me again and smiled, "I told you I loved pleasing you," she said with a little laugh.</p> <p>She stopped her long kisses and continued, "Did I do well?"</p> <p>I thought for a moment, "If so, I think you had better start to enjoy it now!"</p> <p>She slowly lifted my legs, again kissing all the way up my legs as she kissed her way up my thighs and back to my mouth. I let my legs hang open as she lay me down on the bed. She moved up to kiss my chest again. I felt like a sexual goddess was having its way with me. I felt so free as she kissed me, loving me with her kisses and tongue. Suddenly, she pulled up on my nipple and said, "I want this to last forever."</p> <p>I felt her soft lips kiss just under my nipple as she said it. I could feel my nipple getting hard as she kissed all around it. When her lips made their way back up mine, she again kissed just under my ear and put her hand behindâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
