She started to moan again, her back arching just a little; his hand sliding down her belly to cup her cunt. He stroked the entire length of her slit, his fingers dipping deeper then dipping back in to play with the engorged lips of her pussy, feeling her muscles tighten.</p> <p>He started sucking her clit as he fingered her, moving his thumb all the way up to her g-spot while holding her ass in the air. He started fucking her with two fingers, his thumb still stroking around her clit, feeling her start to arch back towards him. His free hand slid down, moving down to her cunt then pushing two fingers between her lips, fucking her so hard that he could feel them pushing against the inner walls of her vagina.</p> <p>He started to finger-fuck her harder, twisting his hand over her clit and plunging into her hot wetness in time to his fingers thrusting deep into her cunt. His own body felt as though it would explode at any second but all at the same time, his cock throbbed with his mounting need. He knew she was almost there. His thumb moved harder in the tight wet channel of her cunt, sliding deeper towards her g-spot, where she was so sensitive now. Her whole body shuddered; her breath stopped as she let the pressure build from the incredible feeling of having her nipple between his teeth again. She started to cry out, her body arching as he squeezed her pussy tight with all his might, his thumb working her clit as his fingers fucked her. She arched her back as the intense orgasm swept through her body, her skin flushed, her cunt swollen and her nipples sensitive as she cried out his name, her breathing coming faster and louder. A long second later her pussy tightened in his hand as she cried out her orgasm, her thighs clamping around him from all the force of it coming.</p> <p>He pulled his hand away from her cunt, his fingers still thrusting as deep within her as he could make them go. Her whole body felt so sore, like she'd gone twenty years without a break. The last thing he wanted to do was hurt her. He just felt as though she might break right then but he didn't care. He'd never fuck a girl like that in his entire life.</p> <p>When she came back to Earth, she was lying on the bed, her legs still wide apart and eyes closed. Her hands were on her breasts, playing with her nipples, and she smiled at him. He smiled back. He'd cum twice that night and there was no rush. He wondered just how much of it he could hold back. She seemed content, sitting there looking content.</p> <p>"What?" she asked quietly. "Just how much? Did I really pass out?"</p> <p>He laughed. He was the best at that, the guy who could last. He didn't mind. Hell, he'd never had any complaints about how well he could last. He'd fucked both girls. She'd made him feel like the world's biggest stud in a while, and he loved fucking. That was when some hot air escaped him. He'd only just had sex with four separate girls at one stage. A dozen afternoons more.</p> <p>"You passed out? That's great!" he said appreciatively as he crawled back on the bed. "I thought I was going to kill you last time," he said, crawling into his own bed.</p> <p>"That was fucking fantastic!" she said, getting into her own bed, pulling the two pillows up against her head, snuggling up to him. "We really, really should do this a lot again."</p> <p>"Oh, I'll do whatever you want," he laughed and pulled her over him, spooning into her like he always did.</p> <p>"Just wait until next time," he growled as she drifted off to sleep.</p> <p>Chapter 6:</p> <p>The following morning, the two men got up early as usual, but they weren't alone. Maryanne came out of the master bedroom naked, her hair completely wild, her skin as pale as the rest of her. "Hey, where are you working this morning?" she asked the two of them.</p> <p>"Oh, just getting the last of my classes out of the lab," they both said, knowing full well they were in the room with their own.</p> <p>"Do you want to talk about last night?" Maryanne asked as she ran her hand down the front of his body, feeling his heat, thinking about the things they'd done.</p> <p>"No. You can stay like this until you wake up, then you can start again," his deep voice sounded so warm. "I just had to get a hold of myself, if I had a way to get back to the roomâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
