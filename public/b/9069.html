What are you thinking,” she teases. “You seem to have a hard time getting hard as well. I’m not going to go in the bathroom. I’m going to lay on the bed in the dark, get my legs wet and do it!”</p> <p>I lay on the bed. My head propped up on pillows. The bathroom door opened enough to peek out. Her nightgown was so skimpy she was sitting in a corner of the bathroom stall. She had her long legs crossed. Her breasts were heaving as her breath was coming in short, short bursts and she was moaning and panting and whimpering.</p> <p>She had slipped a finger deep within herself and was pushing it in and out in such a way that her hand was rubbing her clitoris furiously. I was so hard that it hurt. I wasn’t sure I could drive it through to her and not cum while she did what she did, but damn. I couldn’t help it. I’m sure that it was her finger that she was fucking herself in and out of.</p> <p>I could hear the squishing sound of her hand in her crotch. I couldn’t stay too long and not go in. I was having such a hard time getting off either. I wanted to keep this for as long as possible. So I rolled over on my bed face down on my back. Her breasts were heaving as she was panting and jerking her wet crotch up and down. Her nipples were a hard little nubs and her pussy was glistening wet with her slick juices. I wanted to cum. So I stopped playing and began to run my fingers all around. They were aching for me to touch them. I had to feel what I was going to do.</p> <p>I reached down and touched my swollen cock in its most intimate way. I was so hard it was as if I was going to explode in my hand.</p> <p>“Shit! There it is! I need it!”</p> <p>I’m not exactly sure if it was all the excitement of her fingering herself or the way that she was watching me playing with her pussy but she had a huge orgasm right there on the end of my cock. All I can say is that I was amazed how it could be as erotic as it was. But not to mention it was as if something wasn’t going on right at that very moment, but at the exact time at which it happened.</p> <p>After what seemed like forever she lay there breathing heavily. She had her hands between her legs cupping her breasts in her hand and gently rolling them as they heaved up and down. Her face was relaxed as she was enjoying her little finger in her pussy. She pulled her fingers out of her hole and spread her legs as wide as they would go—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
