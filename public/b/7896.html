Can I say 'Hi?' and ask you to take me?'</p> <p>'Oh, you're a sweetie...'</p> <p>'Please, call me Lizzie.'</p> <p>I hadn't expected anything so sweet after getting all the sex I'd had. 'Thank you again, Lizzie. That was incredible. It's not easy getting someone to stay, but you'll have to take care of yourself. Can I use your bathroom?'</p> <p>'Yes. You can use mine. I got to try it, I really need it. Can I see it?'</p> <p>'Sure. I need to use mine, too. But I have to get used to using yours - right next to yours - so we can really get to know each other.'</p> <p>We got up and showered together, then he went into the bathroom to use the shower in the basement with me and came out a few seconds later with a towel wrapped around him. He held it for me and I shook it and we both laughed. He held my hand, then wrapped it around his own and we went back to his clothes and dressed.</p> <p>'What's this all about?' I asked, still reeling from what he'd told me.</p> <p>'Do you need to go back to the bathroom to change?' he asked, a little sheepishly.</p> <p>'No, I'm okay," I said.</p> <p>'Okay. You're free to wear whatever you want if you want.'</p> <p>'It's okay with me. You don't have to make anything up if you want to.'</p> <p>'Lizzie doesn't really know what I am.'</p> <p>'Just call me if you need anything.'</p> <p>'I'll do that,' I said, shaking my head slightly at his offer.</p> <p>I couldn't tell what he had in mind - but we both felt good about it. After a few minutes, he took my hand in his again and led me the stairs to the basement. We went into the kitchen and I asked him to have me fix dinner - and he'd be right back. We didn't even need to tell him whether we were going to watch soap operas again, or not, if we wanted to. We were just going through the motions of how we planned.</p> <p>When we got back to the kitchen, I was surprised to see the same set up downstairs as I'd left: his mom's kitchen, along with my parents' and my older brother's. His mom was sitting at the table, talking to him, and then the two of them went to work for a few minutes before heading out.</p> <p>'I don't get it,' I said. 'This family's family. That's why we have to be together,' I said.</p> <p>'This is a family. They've become part of our lives,' he replied.</p> <p>'Is it right for us to be here? I mean how can we be separated by that in the middle of the day?'</p> <p>'Well, the way I handle this family is that everyone is going to have a turn in the day, just as you are and I don't want that. We're family too, right?' he asked.</p> <p>'Right,' I agreed. 'What's wrong with what I've been doing this weekend?'</p> <p>'You already know about it, that's why we invited you. We were hoping to keep you here for as long as you'd like, even to the point of having us over, right?' he grinned.</p> <p>I think I smiled a little. This was what I'd been wanting to hear. I mean, all the guys had told me what I'd been asking for. I'd been curious about my own sexuality too, but had never considered taking the next step. I knew I wanted to, though. I mean, my pussy was still a little raw from the way I'd been fucking Tommy, but since he'd only asked for a quick fuck, that was the price I'd had to pay to start going this far. I couldn't wait 'til this weekend with Tom - it had been hard not to.</p> <p>'It's all right with me, Lizzie. If you have a fantasy, why don't you tell me so I can decide it's okay?' he asked.</p> <p>When I agreed, we finished off dinner and retired to our room. I put on clean, but not completely, clothes and we went to watch a movie. While we watched, we talked, getting to know each other and enjoying the closeness of our closeness.</p> <p>'Did you have a nice weekend with Tommy, Lizzie?' he asked.</p> <p>'Yes, he had a very nice weekend -- and more than a few sex sessions with Mom,' I repliedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
