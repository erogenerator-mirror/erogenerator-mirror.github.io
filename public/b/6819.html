Maybe we should try it in a different angle.”</p> <p>He nodded and slipped his hands around my waist to pull me closer. Once we were both in position, the light slipped from the window in a way and our legs came together. I could feel his firm erection pressing against my sex and I could feel myself wanting to let him into me. A groan started to grow in my throat as I felt him push forward, and press his tip against my opening. He pushed just inside me until I felt like a small, tiny animal being held between a pack of small animals.</p> <p>“That feels so good.”</p> <p>I looked into his green eyes and could hear a lustful glint in the corner. I closed my eyes and tilted my pelvis to get a better feel of his penis at first, then opened my eyes again to watch. He had stopped moving and was watching me, a wide smile on his face as his cock slowly pressed into me. I opened my legs to give him a better access, feeling more vulnerable as he slipped inch after inch into me. With every inch he pulled back and pushed forward, stretching my walls a soft little. I tilted my pelvis in unison with his movements, feeling as if I was being sucked in a pussy, while he began sliding ever so slowly in and out, each stroke sending waves of pleasure through my body. My hands moved up to his head and I grabbed a fistful of his hair around his head as he slowly began to work himself into me.</p> <p>My eyes kept opening as he pushed himself deeper until he stopped himself from sliding further inside me. My fingers pulled in tight as my breathing increased as I began to feel myself getting closer. I could feel his cock in my back door and wanted more, desperately wanting him to fill me completely. The look on his face told me what I wanted and he began to slowly pull out all the way, pushing harder and harder into me. The sound of his hips colliding with my ass as his head pushed back against my crotch got me even hotter. I could feel my orgasm coming on and knew it couldn’t be short. I began to shake as he started to move faster. He seemed to sense my impending orgasm, and slowly began to thrust into me, fucking me as my orgasm shot through me. He kissed my cheek until I stopped shaking and opened my eyes to look at him. He smiled at me and leaned down to kiss me. A hand slid to my left breast and began to tease the tip of my nipple.</p> <p>“Tell me what you want.”</p> <p>“I want you in my mouth, anywhere, any way.”</p> <p>I was speechless for a moment. I never used to be so vulnerable. That moment had been the most erotic moment of my entire life, and I didn’t care what the hell was happening to me anymore. My body took over and I grabbed his head and mashed his lips into mine. He began a steady rhythm and we matched it perfectly. I could feel my orgasm approaching and my heart raced as he kept pushing faster, harder. I lifted him to sit in front of me so I could watch his body as he pumped himself into me. His balls slapped my bottom as he pressed himself into me over and over. Finally he was done, leaning forward on his arms as we looked deeply into each other’s eyes.</p> <p>“That was so good, I think I’m going to give you what you’re asking for.”</p> <p>I laughed, then kissed him and got out of the car. I knew he couldn’t handle the sight of me as I watched him, but felt no obligation to do anything different. Just as I drove away, I began to imagine some other man fucking me, taking me doggy style right there on the front of the driveway.
