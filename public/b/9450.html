"It's always okay to look at another man; there's nothing wrong with it, or anyone else," she smiled, and he smiled as well, feeling so pleased with himself, though a lot to give over as she was still so damn pretty and sexy. He had wanted her that way since he first met her, but had never felt the urge to try it for real. It was hard, but he had to admit he didn't give in. After a moment of awkwardness, he smiled back at her, and reached to kiss her gently on the cheek.</p> <p>"You make me feel so good, and warm," he told her, and kissed her lips gently. Her eyes were shining so brightly with happiness as she leaned up to kiss him. "That felt so good, I couldn't have made it better."</p> <p>"It's not a bad thing," she said, smiling up at him. "I've never been happier."</p> <p>"Me either," he agreed, kissing her lips, and she smiled back. "You've got to me pretty much the same and I'm glad you let me. I've never felt this way for anyone else, and it's not that bad, because you're beautiful."</p> <p>"My, I'm impressed!" she exclaimed, and ran her fingers down his body as they kissed. "You're good at that! I can't believe it!" She smiled and ran her hand down his back and squeezed his buttocks. "Oh," he replied, kissing her back. "You're so sexy and you're so sweet," he mused, and she laughed. "So sweet!" he concluded. "I'm so glad that you let me love you."</p> <p>"I want to be a little bit more, too?" she said slyly.</p> <p>"Mmm, I'm glad too!" he replied. "I want to be the best!" he told her, and moved both of their bodies so that he was straddling her as they kissed, their hands moving over each other. She felt so wonderful pressing herself against him, and he sighed and rubbed his hands over her curves.</p> <p>"It feels so good," she declared, as she ran her hands down his back. "What can I do to make you feel so good?" she asked, and he felt his erection pressing against her crotch through his jeans.</p> <p>"I want to make this more special for you," he told her, his voice husky. "Anything," he agreed.</p> <p>"How, by taking advantage of," she said, and ran her hands over his shirt, feeling his firm, pecs under her touch.</p> <p>"It's okay," he assured her. "I want to do this." He pushed up from her and helped remove his jacket, kissing her face and neck as he peeled the shirt from his head.</p> <p>She ran her fingers through his dark hair, and began to unbutton his shirt. "It only makes us feel good if we talk a little," she told him. "I'd like to do this a little bit first, though," she added. She kissed his chest, her tongue slipping between the buttons, and he grinned. "It'll make the whole experience sweeter." She took his chin with her hand, and looked into his handsome eyes. The look in them made him smile, and she grinned back.</p> <p>"That's good," she told him, pulling the buttons of his pants and his shorts off. She stared into his eyes for a minute, before she got to her knees, and moved her hands slowly up from his ankles. His penis, standing proudly from his body, was at her eye level as she moved her hands up, but continued on up, the heat coming from his chest through his jeans giving her some excitement. She touched his hardness, and then slowly slid her hands toward his waist, his head dropping to her chest where she kissed her way from his neck to the valley of his breasts.</p> <p>"There," she told him, looking up at him as she stroked his shaft. "Now, be happy that I'm here, and that I can take care of all of you."</p> <p>"Thank you," he said, and put his hands up her hair.</p> <p>"For the love of all the gods, how thoughtful!" she declared, then ran her hands over his chest. He couldn't tell if it was a tease to her, or anything, but he smiled and leaned him head against the softness of her breasts. "There, all the way down," he said, and she winced as his fingers tightened on her nipples. He leaned down and kissed her, running his lips over hers, before she pulled away.</p> <p>"Don't you dare take off the tie," he told her.
