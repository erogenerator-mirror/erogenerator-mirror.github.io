Oh, that’s so fucking good.” She leaned over, her tits hanging close to my cock, and licked the bottom end where it met the top of her lips and glistened with sweat, taking care to take the tip so it entered her mouth over and over, and then back out into her mouth in an upstroke, the glistening surface a little damp from her saliva. Her hands came up to massage her right breast gently as she began to stroke my cock ever faster, making it all that much better for her.

She kissed me softly.</p> <p>“So, are you sure you didn’t want to do this with me,” I whispered kissing her again.</p> <p>Karen shrugged, “Hell no, no it’s good to me,” she said.
