I was soooo hoping you and I could spend the next couple of days together in my bed. And I still want to know all about you." He leaned forward to kiss her once again and she leaned her head around him and kissed him. After that, their kiss and kiss, she turned her head around again and they kissed some more. They had a nice wet kiss the first time and after that, they made out like there was no tomorrow. As they kissed deeply again, Jessica ran her hands all over his chest and down his belly. After a moment, she reached between his legs and began to rub his hardening cock through his pants and she said, "Do you like that?"</p> <p>"Yes, I do." He responded.</p> <p>"And it's not just because you are hard," Jessica laughed, "but so much more because it turns you on." She pulled back to sit up in his lap and she slid her hand into his pants and began to stroke his still hard cock while watching his expression. He slid his own hands beneath her bra and cupped her breasts. He slowly rubbed each nipple through the thin fabric until both were hard and erect. Jessica watched as his head dipped and then slowly came back up to meet his eyes. His eyes were so intense and intense that she started to get nervous.</p> <p>"I... I have to do this. I can't just fuck you. You have to stop before we... make out." Jessica said quickly.</p> <p>"No. I mean," he stammered, "we could always... you know... get something to eat or... or something... and then... you know..." his voice trailed off and he looked around. "There's nowhere else we could go tonight and I'm so hard I probably could get a hard-on anyway." His cheeks blushed all the way to his eyes. Jessica's hand began to stroke faster and he leaned backwards so that he could kiss her more. Jessica felt his lips on hers and she kissed him back, feeling his body pressed against hers. In response, she rubbed his now hard cock faster through his pants. His body became stiff and his breathing quickened. Jessica kept up with his hands on her breasts and breasts again before taking his hand away. "Let me," she said, pulling down his pants and boxers. She dropped to her knees between his legs then, her warm head resting on his cock. He reached down with one hand to cup her head, his fingers lightly running through her hair. His fingers tangled in her hair and she let him pull her mouth down just a bit and then began to let the head of his cock slide into her mouth.</p> <p>"Oh." Jessica moaned and started to back up so that it was in her throat but he held her back as she came up. "I don't think we were on the right path here," she smiled up at him. After taking a minute or so to breathe again, she kissed him once more, pushing herself up on her knees onto his cock which was still in her mouth. Jessica took his head as far as she could into her throat and held there, letting his cock go in while her lips pulled up on it.</p> <p>"Oh," she said, her throat muscles working the head of his cock up and down. "Fuck my throat," she ordered with a look that was sexy and dangerous, "fuck my face, baby, fuck my face." He reached onto the bed, grabbing one of the vibrators from the nightstand, and Jessica leaned forward and put the head of the vibrator all the way inside of her mouth with her tongue sticking out just enough to get it wet. She pushed herself back a bit before lifting herself up and began to bob her head up and down again. He grabbed a fistful of her hair and her other hand reached up and tangled itself in the hair on her head, her own hands holding tightly against her head. He began to thrust his hips up at her as she continued at his pace, using her hair to get his cock deeper. His body stiffened, his eyes rolled back and his mouth hung open for a few moments before he went rigid and he came up on her. Jessica held his cock inside her mouth as he came and she sucked up all his juices, sucking up as much as she could. As he finally pulled out of her mouth, she looked up at his face and smiled, showing him how much she missed blowing him but she always enjoyed the taste of him. He wiped the last of the come off his lips and looked down at Jessica as if he just did a job and thanked her for a great night of sex that was definitely not something to repeat. He leaned forward again as she stood up from him.</p> <p>"So, how was the first sex," Jessica turned to him, "were weâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
