Her lips opened in a smile as she allowed her clit to be pushed through, the slick moisture spreading like heat through her body. I began to massage her clit, causing her to tremble.</p> <p>"Cum for me. Let me feel you cum. I want to feel you climax, too!"</p> <p>Our eyes locked together, my hand sliding over her clit, her fingers entwined inside my hair, we came and came. My head leaned back as my body shuddered and tensed with each wave of cum shooting from my cock. Our pulses were intense and our pulses lasted longer. It seemed like our orgasms began as only the most intense, each orgasm seemed as if it went on and on until it faded to nothing.</p> <p>My hand slipped free of her body and I looked down at her. I could see her chest heaving with each breath she took. I watched as she reached between her legs and grasped her hand, drawing it up to her lips where her lips glistened, she smiled and touched her own lips to mine. Our kisses became more passionate as our tongues entwined, exploring each others. Our lips separated. Then we exchanged saliva.</p> <p>It was almost like the first time we had made love, like it had always been just a moment ago. We broke our contact briefly and then quickly found our clothes and made it to the shower. We made it back to bed before being joined by the sounds of the shower going on in the other bedroom. We kissed once more before getting up and gathering our clothes and heading to my bedroom to get dressed and head out for dinner.</p> <p>After showering and dressed, we climbed the stairs of my house looking for a cab. When we looked in my kitchen, Sara got a cab already sitting on the seat beside me. With a knowing smile, she got into the driver's seat with the window next to me. I followed her to the passenger's door and then walked to the driver's side as she drove away. I noticed that she did a lap dance in my face. As she pulled away, she said loudly. "Thank you, sir." She leaned over and kissed me and smiled widely before exiting the car.</p> <p>As the car pulled away, she said to me, "Come on. I'll get your bag and I'll take you to Mr. White to meet the people from the bar." With that, she disappeared into the parking lot as I got on my bike and headed for the door. I opened the doors for her, walked her in to my large house across the street from the one we had been at before. I handed her a bag and she took the one from my house and disappeared again. When she reached the door, she kissed me full on the lips and said "Thank you for a wonderful evening. When you got home, I wanted to go see Mr. Wombert."</p> <p>I took my bag and followed her to the door. Once again we walked slowly across the street. Inside, I found it was really a large house, with a large garden and a back yard to the left. We pulled up to a gate across the front lawn and I got out to open it to let her in. Once inside, we found a door along the inside wall next to the kitchen window, the inside of which was a huge dining room where Sara was sitting.</p> <p>We sat down together, our hands interlocking, my head on her shoulder as we looked into the big house through the window. After a couple of drinks, our hands found their way to her lap as we kissed. My hands moved from her back to her bottom. As she continued to kiss me, I slid one hand under her blouse, one to the small of her back as our kiss continued. Suddenly, she broke the kiss, my cock quickly rising in erection, and I heard her say, through our kiss, "I want to see. Go inside."</p> <p>I led her into the main room and watched as she slid her blouse over her head. She then sat down on the sofa in one corner of the room. She pulled up her arms and pulled the sleeves from her shoulders and it fell to the sides. Her smallish breasts had a deep pinkish tint to them, almost to the color of her skin. They were not as large as Sara's, but were very shapely and full. I leaned over her, kissing her neck while her hands began to undo her skirt. I undid the zipper a little at a time, feeling her shiver as the skirt slid down her legs, and when she finished undressing, I put my hands around her and pulled her against me. I kissed her mouth, her chin and her nose, finally coming to rest on her lips. I felt her lips open and her lips met mine. Our tongues slowlyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
