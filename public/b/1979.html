It was amazing. He just kept me there. It was the best fuck I've ever had.'</p> <p>'That's great! Oh my God that was so exciting and I loved it.'</p> <p></p> <p>'You just didn't know the difference?'</p> <p>'Yeah. Well, it was the most pleasurable fuck I've ever had. It's been a while with you, and just seeing you was such a turn-on. And I can't wait to have all the fun!'</p> <p></p> <p>'This is amazing. I've never felt anything like that before. Not even my boyfriend did that before.'</p> <p>'Why? Does it feel that good?' he asked.</p> <p>'It sounds good. It's different. It feels awesome – and I think my pussy is getting really wet.'</p> <p>'Wow! I haven't done anything like that before.'</p> <p>'No. I came, I came really hard. It felt like I was squirting.'</p> <p>'Is that possible? If I did that I could get a boyfriend, but that's not a problem right?'</p> <p>'No. It just made me wetter. The thing about doing that with a boyfriend is that it's so much better with a woman instead of a guy!'</p> <p>"So you are actually having sex with a woman now. Was there a bit of a break up now? It is really intense for me to go that far before. We've had so many sex-filled hours." I didn't say anything. I was still trying to digest what I just said. My head was spinning with thought. "What about me? I didn't think this would go any further than that."</p> <p>"Not at all!"</p> <p>'And for your information, I was in love with you for as long as I was alive, and had since I was a teenager. Now that I know what I'm doing, I'm even more in love with this! And I know I can't go on like this.'</p> <p>"Just what did you think it was?' I asked.</p> <p>"Honey, I was in love with you, and you were the first real girlfriend I ever had. That's just what the rest of my relationships, well, with guys and girls have started to leave me for."</p> <p>'Wow! I am really confused. Is this what is happening? I have never imagined my girlfriend feeling as good as I do today.'</p> <p>'Well, you'll find out in a few weeks. You should take care of it before it goes any further.'</p> <p>"Now I have a question," I said.</p> <p>"Go ahead. I'm glad we're being open with each other. Did you have the courage to tell me?'</p> <p>I felt my face burning with shame.</p> <p>"Did you ask permission?" he said, trying his hardest to be stern, but failing miserably."</p> <p>"No!" I said. "I told you I'd answer. Now you have to ask me twice!"</p> <p>"No! You promised you'd answer if I ever asked!"</p> <p>"No it's because of what you saw. You have to tell me. I can't."</p> <p>"I am very serious."</p> <p>"What do you want me to tell you?"</p> <p></p> <p>I stared at him for a minute. I was trying to come up with something convincing.</p> <p>"I have to tell you this. I have been in love with someone for a long time and, well, for as long as I can, it hasn't been one person at any time since I've been intimate with a guy. I guess every guy in the world has their pick of the best girlfriends. I guess you just have to have your own pick of the best friends. I'm just doing what you told me to. I'm sorry if I didn't tell you before. I just didn't want to do anything that could jeopardise our relationship."</p> <p>He couldn't stop laughing.</p> <p>I just laughed and said "Yeah, right."</p> <p>"Then who is the best friend?"</p> <p></p> <p>I didn't answer him. I just laughed and said "I guess now that you're officially a best friend, we will make a great team."</p> <p>"What! Do you mean now that I'm a best friend?"</p> <p>"No! I meant now that you've moved in. We are closer than ever. Have you ever been alone with your girlfriend?"</p> <p>There wasn't really any point in trying not to be honest with him, which I had to try to overcome. "The first time I was with a girl, it was in my car."</p> <p>"Oh. Okay. I was just so nervous," he said—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
