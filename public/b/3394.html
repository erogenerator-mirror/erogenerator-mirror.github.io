He was on Viagra.</p> <p>****</p> <p>"Are you going to come back?"</p> <p>"Maybe."</p> <p>"But it doesn't have to end tonight," Shelly smiled and pulled into the parking lot of the restaurant. She was dressed very sexy. She was holding a bouquet of flowers and a smile. "See? I know it's my favorite thing to do." She saw him approaching and smiled. A tear trickled down her cheek. He looked back over his shoulder.</p> <p>"Where you going?"</p> <p>"In a little park with my co-workers," Shelly said. A pang of sadness flashed in his eyes.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>"So, what are you going to do today?"</p> <p>"I'll just be in town for a few days. That should give me plenty of time to pack. I want to leave before 9 am."</p> <p>"Oh, okay" He stood there for a moment admiring her as she took the two steps over to him. A moment later, they were in the car. "I hate to do this," she said with a smile.</p> <p>"Don't you want to come back?" She knew he did, but she wasn't ready to let on.</p> <p>"I don't know," she said, "maybe." He kissed her cheek. He had a plan. "I'll tell you when I get there."</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>The house was magnificent. The backyard was a bit more ornate than her own private garden. More comfortable looking, too. They parked in front.</p> <p>There was a beautiful wrought iron fence surrounding the house. The door was open and she could see the ocean. Her hand drifted to her mouth.</p> <p>"This is so nice... I really missed our backyard," he said.</p> <p>"Why? Are you cold?"</p> <p>"No, not really. It's a beautiful place."</p> <p>"I'll get warmed to the idea," he said, "if the temperature of the water is okay."</p> <p>"That would be cool."</p> <p>"Do you want me to bring a blanket with us?" He asked.</p> <p>"No. Let's do whatever we like."</p> <p>She smiled and turned to kiss him. They kissed. She felt his tongue run along her teeth as they held each other close. He was strong and forceful in his kisses. The way he moved himself against her made her so hot she could feel it in her bones, especially when she put her finger tips to his lips. Her body was alive, electric and wet.</p> <p>"Maybe we should have brought condoms."</p> <p>"I'm on the pill," He said. She smiled.</p> <p>He drove the car over to the house. She got out and closed the door. It was a great place. He followed her to the bedroom. She stripped off her robe and lay on the bed. He got naked and joined her for a few minutes. He had a nice body for a man. He moved on top of her. He kissed her for a few moments. Then he felt the warm liquid of a condom roll over his member. He entered her slowly and moved slowly. He had never been much of a lover. He was content to just stay inside as long as he wanted. She sighed and let out a moan and his body began to go limp. She looked at him. "It's okay,"</p> <p>"It's okay," he said.</p> <p>Shelly grabbed his ass and began to roll him on his back. She slid onto him and pushed him back. Looking into his eyes she began to ride him again. She felt his warm hand on her ass, but never made any attempt to touch her. The combination of his hand and now a condom on made her pussy tingle. "No," she said, "I've never been with a woman."</p> <p>"Don't worry, I can make you feel good," he said while giving her ass a playful slap. He began to thrust into her with full force, moving deeper every time. She could smell another man's aftershave as she rode him. When she couldn't hold back, she gave a loud moan. He thrust deeper with every push. He held himself tight against her, just to feel the moment. She could feel herself beginning to cum. He rubbed her clit and came inside her. They kissed a moment later when they could find the strength to move. He rolled off of her and rolled onto his back. She was on top of him and they smiled.</p> <p>"I have to go. But the time is right." They kissed for several minutes. They rested before going to bed. He asked her to call him if she was okayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
