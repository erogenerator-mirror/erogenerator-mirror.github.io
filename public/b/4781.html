I could feel my pussy pulsing around my shaft and knew it was throbbing with pleasure. I knew for sure that I would be able to come inside of her tonight, but right at that moment, I didn't care. It felt so good.</p> <p>I heard her moan a little as I pushed ever deeper inside of her, but was soon rewarded with a loud moan that got louder just as she wrapped her legs around me.</p> <p>I was about to come soon, so I pulled all the way out of her sweet pussy, which almost caused her to scream with delight, but quickly started pumping my seed inside of her with great force. After pumping my load, I started to pull my limp cock out again, and started to rub it all over her stomach and chest.</p> <p>I got my face all flushed, but I still couldn't believe what I just did. That is, until I noticed something. Her bra was still hanging on her neck, which made me smile. I put her bra on her neck and she smiled back, knowing she should have worn it to hide, but she didn't seem to mind.</p> <p>I walked over to the bed and sat down next to her, laying my head on her lap and we just held each other. After a while I lifted my body from hers, I started to feel weak in the knees, but eventually I got my strength back and I put my feet out, I started to play with my still throbbing cock.</p> <p>Once I had it at full mast, I looked around the room. The others were in various positions, some sleeping, others watching, most asleep, but a few had on their feet propped up on the pillows with their heads turned towards me, a few playing, the last had on a pillow, and I just kept playing with it, and when I got to the last one, I just started to masturbate it while I listened to her.</p> <p>She seemed to enjoy playing with my cock, I guess that was the reason of my staying. It was still soft with all the cum and the pussy juices, now I was able to masturbate it better with my pussy juices still around me.</p> <p>Just then, I heard her voice. This time it was different. It sounded like a high pitch, but definitely was coming from her, she hadn't come as yet. It's not that she didn't deserve to, yet, but I was sure she didn't want it to because it was bad, I mean the girls just had the time of their lives with me. I think she needed relief after all. I figured if it felt good enough.</p> <p>I looked at her, she had still not raised her head from her pillow and was looking towards the window. I decided to see if I could get a closer look at what was really going on. I quickly stood up to get my hand. When I was in this position, I felt her right arm reach around my head. In this position, she was able to pull her head up a little more, I felt a little shock, but a pleasurable feeling, I guess I needed her to pull my head to hers.</p> <p>After a few minutes of this, I felt her hand starting to move down. She moved her hand down to my cheek, and I leaned closer to try to kiss her mouth in this position. She stopped me so I couldn't kiss her, again, but this time I did kiss her.</p> <p>To feel her lips again was like electricity throughout my body, so I moved my face a little closer to her. I started to kiss her, I wanted to savour her mouth more that anything her roommate had so recently. She tasted kind of salty, but it was not bad, she was pretty sweet not like the taste of her roommate, but different tasting.</p> <p>I was in a hurry to get my lips on hers so I pulled my mouth away quickly and pushed her face down to her pillow. I started pushing her face in towards her pillow, she started to get really excited, but I knew she didn't want to make me take care of her. With a few more thrusts, she started to moan and groan.</p> <p>In spite of her moan, I could feel her pussy gripping my cock, slowly building up to a wonderful climax. I kept pushing her body back and forth towards it, slowly at first, but faster and faster, as we neared the end of our climax.</p> <p>I could feel my cock starting to twitch and I wanted to be in her. I knew it wouldn't take me long now. If I stayed there and stroked for a short while, my body wouldn't be able to help itself. So I started to move my hips as I started to thrust into her soft, but still tight pussy.</p> <p>I was only doing it for her, but when it was clear thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
