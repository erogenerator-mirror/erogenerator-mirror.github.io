It's been a long day and you're exhausted... I bet what we have is wonderful but it might be a little bit more than that."</p> <p>He grinned at me, "It sure is. But what will we do while we're here? Is there a reason for the trip into the city and the drive into town and to the theater to see?"</p> <p>"Don't you see there isn't much at home we could do. The shops will be interesting with most of the old stuff we bought over the past few years."</p> <p>My heart was skipping a beat and I looked at him questioningly. His lips brushed my cheek again as he said softly. "There's a reason we'll come here, baby." He slid down my body and I felt his fingers at my lips. The heat of his breath as he drew them between his teeth was like an electric charge that I had not experienced before. He whispered in my ear, "I don't think I got a hard on from watching you, but there sure will be something there."</p> <p>"Mmm, it looks like somebody's happy to be in someone else's business."</p> <p>"I think I got a bit of a soft-body there from last night." He gave it up with a smile.</p> <p>"I think it gets to you some."</p> <p>His head moved lower until my dick was at his lips. He let me slip through his tongue and began licking it. His mouth opened and his tongue slipped inside. I heard myself sigh and it was only then that I began to move toward the door. When we got back outside I saw him grinning up at me. He nodded and I kissed him. "It was incredible," I said.</p> <p>"It sure was." He smiled sheepishly.</p> <p>"We only did a bit more than that. You should really go to a movie like that. You're still so beautiful you couldn't possibly get enough before we left. I couldn't have had more though," he said. I smiled back with that grin.</p> <p>"Okay, I can do that. I can do that in an airplane."</p> <p>That was a nice way to put it and I was pretty damn proud of how I had let my confidence slip by.</p> <p>We headed back to him as I had thought. I wanted to know what my chances were so I could be a bigger part of this trip. Maybe the trip would turn a little upside-down.</p> <p>To be continued in Part 2â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
