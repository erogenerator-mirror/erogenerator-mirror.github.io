I leaned forwards and kissed her on the lips. She opened her mouth a bit as our tongues touched. "Mmmm." She moaned.</p> <p>She had begun moving her hips slightly in concert with my hand movements. My cock was hard and rubbing against the fabric of my pants. She pulled my boxers down and pulled the tip of my shaft against her soft lips. She began sliding down my swollen length. I felt her warm mouth slide all the way down. "Oh god," I moaned.</p> <p>Alyssa's soft tongue caressed my shaft as she slowly slid back up over and over again, letting her pussy envelop my tool. Her moans became louder the closer she approached her peak.</p> <p>I could feel my body tensing as my cock began to throb. I wanted to be inside of her. I wanted to fuck her all on my own. I tried to slow myself down and just enjoy feeling her soft warm body.</p> <p>With one hand my fingers traced the outline of her lips. I then pulled her down until the tip of my cock met her opening. "Alyssa." I whispered as I entered her warm soft pussy. Alyssa moaned with each inch she took in.</p> <p>I could feel her muscles tighten around my cock as she slowly sank onto me. I had never felt anything that felt this good before. "Oh god Alyssa." I moaned as she began to move up and down on my shaft. Her tongue found its way deeper between her lips and the sound of our lust filled moans filled the room. "Alyssa." I repeated her name.</p> <p>Her hands wrapped around my body as her soft flesh moved on my hard cock. I felt her wet heat surround my length as her pussy slid smoothly down my shaft. I slowly pushed my hips upwards, wanting to be as deep as I could. "Oh god." I moaned as she began to fuck me with her sweet pussy. Alyssa's tits shook around my body as her legs wrapped around my waist. My balls bounced as she slid up and down more rapidly. We continued to moan, groan, and make out as we made our way up to the top of the stairs.</p> <p>Her voice was breathy and husky. "I want you. I..." she whispered while she broke her kiss with me.</p> <p>I wanted to kiss her as well. I pulled her away from me and grabbed my dick. "I want you. I want to make you happy." I whispered.</p> <p>Alyssa smiled. "I'll be happy for you. I want you." she said softly.</p> <p>I placed her on the bed and I removed her shorts. I lifted her feet to my chest and placed them inside of my body. I kissed her feet before pushing her legs up higher. Her pussy opened for me, begging for my member. I placed her lips against mine in the middle as I lowered one foot to rest the other on her hip.</p> <p>I moved in and started stroking my cock while we began kissing. Her lips were softer than hers though she was more firm as her body shivered in pleasure. Her moans and kisses told every nerve in my body.</p> <p>"Oh yes." she cried softly. "Yes!"</p> <p>I took my fingers to her clit and found the bud. I began to stroke into her while I kissed her. My breathing increased as she pushed her pussy up against me while I continued to kiss her. I had no idea if this was what it would be like to experience a real lover. I loved everything that was happening now. I loved the feel of her soft body underneath me, the heat of the moment, the sound of her moans while we made love and she came more than I could possibly say.</p> <p>I leaned her back on the bed and climbed aboard her. I began to kiss my way down. We kissed and moaned as my cock pressed itself against her wet pussy. "Oh god." Alyssa moaned, "Fuck me. I want it." She took my dick into her pussy, "Fuck me hard."</p> <p>I began to thrust into her. I was not sure how much more I was going to last. The heat in my legs was incredible to the touch. The wetness that was around me was amazing. Her body was incredible to fuck. We kissed and fondled each other as we made love. I continued to kiss down her body until my mouth met her pussy. I slowly kissed down the length of her body in one motion.</p> <p>Alyssa's eyes were closed as the feelings of being filled with a dick brought on by a dick inside her body were amazing. As I reached her pussy I could feel it relax and open. She would pull me into her tightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
