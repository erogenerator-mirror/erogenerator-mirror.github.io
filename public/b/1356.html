He had to have seen what I was doing, because when I turned around the corner to go to the kitchen he said, "If you don't start to follow I'll have to tell mom." So I was going with him to follow dad, and a few minutes down she had already pulled herself together and was going to tell him.</p> <p>When I got to my bedroom I found a very dirty mirror and turned on the light. She was standing there, and I saw that she was wearing a skirt. I stood and looked at my reflection, and I can only guess that she had seen me and wanted to say something. The only thing that I thought I could do was say, "Are you looking at your reflection in the mirror? Why did you have to come to me dressed that way, and then ask you to do it again?" I thought I had said those words loud and clear. And, I did.</p> <p>"Well, mom, I guess you're looking at my reflection because that's all you're looking at, but you do look at me." I tried not to sound like I was trying to sound like I was trying to speak but I didn't. My arms and legs were shaking and I was afraid to turn around or speak. Finally I asked her what was wrong, and she started crying and had told me her problem. I wasn't sure what to say if I wanted to say what I really needed to say.</p> <p>After a few minutes of trying to soothe her she stopped crying and said, "My dad, I want to ask you something else." I said, "Of course you have to do it, what is it?" She stopped and said, "I mean, it's not like I just met you, and it's not like we're friends anymore." I said, "Well, I was, but if that was you, then it was you, and if it's not, then I shouldn't be doing it. I, I just can't." She said, "I mean, it's not like I saw you when I got here." I thought that it was going to be hard to talk with her like that and to continue the conversation without hurting my chances of getting another chance to talk with her. She just said, "I guess you're right. I mean, if we're not going to be friends, then I guess it's fine. What do you think?" So with that she closed the door, turned off the light, and went back on the sofa, with me coming in the next room.</p> <p>I went to my room and changed into a T-shirt and sweat pants and walked into the living room and sat down.</p> <p>"You better get dressed, as I've got some questions I need to ask you." I got up and went to the closet to get a pair of old cotton panties, I guess I looked like a girl who had to wear a bra in high school. I walked back out to the living room and sat down again.</p> <p>"OK, I don't know where to start this, but I'm not a little girl anymore when it comes to these kinds of questions. I mean if you go ahead and ask the questions, I'll just try to be honest, if you don't try to change the subject, it means that you'll end up having to ask a bunch of really complicated questions, like something stupid, because it's not like they would just be a quick fix or anything."</p> <p>"This was my fault. I shouldn't have made those comments. So, I'm trying to keep the conversation going, why don't you have questions you will want to know about, and I am trying to put out some light in the relationship, which at the moment is sort of in the past. It's not all sex or anything. It's just different to have all those different experiences with different people and different circumstances. If there is a common cause you should have a reason for a different path for you, like someone's relationship to be different, even if I wanted to change the subject or something."</p> <p>She sat there and looked at me. This man who had just told me that he wanted to see my mom dressed again, she thought, was trying to put me on, because I was putting her on. Of course I was putting her on, she just had a point.</p> <p>"Alright, but I don't want the subject too complicated. I really do want to set something straight and not to start at the beginning. So, my question first: Why did they put us together this way. Are you married?"</p> <p>"Yes, I am. I married a woman who wasn't happy. I don't know if she was happy, but I wasnâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
