Jealousy was starting to creep into his voice. He really did look angry.</p> <p>"I don't want anyone to see you when you don't have them. I'm sorry," he whispered quietly. "I can't. But you're not going to get away with this. You had your fun. I know you enjoyed it. I have to admit, though."</p> <p>"You can't," he sighed. "You can't," he repeated firmly. "Please don't think I'm going to back down."</p> <p>Kneeling at his feet, he gently picked up his coat, which was now so wrinkled and dry he felt like a doll. He had to wipe the tears from his eyes. Pulling on his sweater, he opened the door as gently as he could.</p> <p>"I have to go," he said. "I'm sorry."</p> <p>He was already closing the door when he heard the doorbell ring again. Glancing up, he saw that it was from the police. He looked at him.</p> <p>"Okay. I don't have a fucking car," he muttered hoarsely.</p> <p>Jacking his hand into the pockets of his dress shirt he managed to pull it back into place before stepping out onto the street. Grabbing the handle of his doorbell, he felt his stomach roll at the thought that he had caused so much of what he had told Jason to happen.</p> <p>He heard his car coming. He checked his phone and was surprised to see it was 10.30. Opening the front door, his nerves jumped as he saw his husband standing there. He watched him as he strode toward him and smiled.</p> <p>"Wow. I thought you lost the keys," Jager whispered as he kissed his wife on the cheek.</p> <p>"Thank-you," Jager smiled back softly. He could imagine how his daughter was going through this. He couldn't blame her for that. Her father was not exactly a saint. And he wasn't really interested in her. Not exactly. But it was hard to deny that she was his daughter. Of all his daughters he had no problem loving them, but then again, none was quite as beautiful as he thought she was.</p> <p>"Are we still having dinner?" she asked, almost as though they hadn't had time to think about anything else.</p> <p>"Yes," Jager nodded. "It's now eight."</p> <p>"It's getting late," her father sighed. He watched as Karyn walked into the house.</p> <p>"I hope you don't mind," she whispered. "I was just so happy to hear from you again."</p> <p>"I'd rather be here, Karyn," he chuckled. "I'm going to miss you."</p> <p>"I want you to come stay with us for awhile," She smiled down at him. "I mean it. I don't want anything bad to happen to you."</p> <p>"You worry too much," he smiled.</p> <p>"Yes, I do," she smiled at him. "I'll let you go. You two go to your private chambers. When you finish eating you'll come in here and sit up for a minute." She leaned in to kiss him as she moved into the kitchen.</p> <p>"Yes, Mrs. Martin," he nodded as he finished his breakfast and followed Karyn out to see Mr. Martin.</p> <p>"Can we get married again?" she asked enthusiastically.</p> <p>His heart was beating so hard it was nearly painful. Finally, he answered and Karyn smiled.</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"Because I love the way my father dresses and I like those long, tuxedos he loves so much," Karyn grinned.</p> <p>"So he likes wearing tuxes," he whispered, hoping he didn't draw the wrong attention to his bride's words.</p> <p>"Oh that," she laughed. "They get the boys into them," she giggled. "And it's good for their spirits."</p> <p>Looking at his wife the way he remembered, he frowned.</p> <p>"I don't know what it is," he said slowly.</p> <p>Her eyes twinkled.</p> <p>"It doesn't matter. They aren't for us anymore," she sighed. "I want to do a lot more than just be your wife."</p> <p>Jager looked as though he was going to cry but instead, he smiled and hugged his wife.</p> <p>"I love you," he sighed. "I always have."</p> <p>Karyn returned the smiling face.</p> <p>"I love you too," she whispered as she kissed him. "I wish I could stay here forever."</p> <p>"We're never going to get old Karyn," he murmured as he kissed his lips once more. "We'll just have to be happy as long as you're happy."</p> <p>"I'm going toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
