I mean it's me."</p> <p>He tried to calm her down but she was already rubbing her eyes.</p> <p>"Well, I'm not too comfortable about that."</p> <p>She laughed. She gave a little wry chuckle as she reached for a towel out of the tub. "You're not going to need to be bothered with me being naked around you."</p> <p>A mischievous, devilish smile crossed his face as she dried herself off. His eyes went wide as she moved out of his way, "Um, what?"</p> <p>"I'm just going to the bathroom."</p> <p>"Nah, I'll just get a cold shower."</p> <p>She laughed, "Oh, really? Why do you do that?"</p> <p>He shook his head. "It gets me more naked then if I were to have anything on while I'm in the shower."</p> <p>They both laughed as she started to dry herself off. When she got back to the bed, she was still rubbing her hands over her body as he sat there staring at her.</p> <p>"Aren't you going to be in bed next to me?"</p> <p>"If I was that, you wouldn't be able to sleep."</p> <p>"I can go to sleep if I wanted to, but it's not an everyday situation."</p> <p>"Oh, we'll see."</p> <p>He sat there, not moving but still staring at her beautiful body.</p> <p>"So... are you going to say something?"</p> <p>He stood up. Her nipples hardened instantly under the robe. He had the urge to take it off. "We'll see. I'm not going anywhere, I have a full house."</p> <p>At the sound of her voice he turned around and said, "But aren't you gonna tell me if you had on that suit?"</p> <p>A naughty grin spread across her face. She reached up and undid the tie so that he could see her bare shoulders. He took a step forward and took her into his arms. She rubbed her hands up and down his lean body as he gently kissed the side of her neck. His mouth made its way down the side of her neck, and kissed her on the side of her jaw. The feeling made her legs weak as he trailed kisses slowly to her ear, licking and sucking her ear lobe as her hand moved to his chest to gently rub and caress his growing cock through his pants. He took his hand to her side and slowly slid it down the side of her body, rubbing her hips and ass as she took his hand and guided it up the side of her body. He moved his mouth down to her neck and sucked it gently as his hands slid up to her nipples. She moaned and slid his way down to the bed. He smiled as he leaned over and whispered in her ear.</p> <p>"I want to eat you right here."</p> <p>He pulled her body back off the bed, sliding the robe off of her body and kissed her neck. He was looking up at her with lust in his eyes as he dropped her back down, her legs were still wrapped around his waist. He moved in between her legs, his fingers finding there way to the damp center of her. He pressed his tip against her wet pussy lips, then leaned forward and gently pushed inside her. The groan that escaped her mouth was all the encouragement he needed to push inside her. He watched as her lips opened to him as he slowly moved inside of her wetness. The sound of her moaning was all he needed to bring a moan from her and he leaned in to plant a kiss to her lips.</p> <p>When he broke the kiss, he turned her body and laid her down on the bed. He pushed inside of her quickly, she had no idea how long it had been since a guy came inside of her when she was with someone else. After a few moments, he pulled himself out as slowly as he could and watched as her eyes widened as he pushed into her. She let out a gasp as the feeling of the head entering her and the feeling of the long length rubbing against her clit made her arch her back, and move her hips. There was no slow motion, or long fast strokes to the rhythm of his hands as he pushed himself in and out of her wetness. It was hard against her clit and the feeling of his cock rubbing against it was enough to drive her crazy. He pulled himself out so that just the head of his cock was inside of her, leaving himself inside of her. The feelings of her orgasm were more than he could handle, he pulled himself completely out of her and turned himself around to thrust himself inside of her. For a while they used only one hand each, he wanted to make sure it didn't take long before they would be both off to one side.
