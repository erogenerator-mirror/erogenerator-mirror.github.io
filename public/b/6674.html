I know I look good, but I know I'm not the greatest looker either.</p> <p>"Don't give up on that," Jenny says leaning closer looking me up and down.</p> <p>"Jenny can see I'm not a bad looking guy, if I was a boy she'd be jealous." I tell her honestly.</p> <p>"So you'd like her to look at you?" Jenny said giggling so I know I couldn't be saying that.</p> <p>"Yeah I'd never ask Jenny to do that," I laugh. "So you wouldn't even be able to look at me? She'd know I wasn't a man."</p> <p>I laugh again and Jenny laughs too.</p> <p>"You like it," Jenny says leaning in.</p> <p>"I know you do, but I'm just the average guy." I tell her honestly. Jenny doesn't seem upset about all this.</p> <p>"Well you look like a guy, and you can't even do anything." She says.</p> <p>"Yeah I can," I tell her truthfully.</p> <p>"Well we should take off the sheets." Jenny says pulling them off. There's no reason to take them off now, it was just a little weird. Not exactly sexy or weird to look at either, but it felt like we were closer than before. I didn't care much for this.</p> <p>"Yeah we can." I say. Jenny comes closer to me and sits on the edge of the bed again. She pulls up her shirt and pulls down her pants and sits on the edge of the bed again. She puts her right foot on the floor next to my leg. I pull down the sheets and get them off the bed. Then I pull the bed up a little giving Jenny room to get out of bed. We have to crawl over here and I know she's feeling neglected. She smiles as she climbs on the bed pulling up her skirt up and onto her hips. She was just wearing a short skirt this morning. I could see her white panties through the white mesh lace of her underwear.</p> <p>I look down and saw her pubic hair through her panties. She has a little black landing strip that I always liked her to have. The landing strip is so white and shiny, you can even see a little white landing strip on the back side of her underwear. I had even seen a few freckles when we were out.</p> <p>She looks up at me and grabs my hand leading me to the side of the bed. I lay down and she pulls up my shirt, then climbs on top of me. She puts her underwear and my briefs around me and pulls my dick out of my pants. My dick isn't massive but it's a good size and it jumps out at her. She puts her left leg over mine pulling my pants down until my dick is between her legs.</p> <p>I kiss her lips then lower and lick up and down her lips.</p> <p>"Mmm you taste so good." I say as I get at her lips again. Jenny pushes my hand away and brings it up to the inside of her thigh. This time I stroke the inner part of her thigh and she moans a little and starts rubbing her clit.</p> <p>"Ahhh....I think I like this better." Jenny moans over my ear. I know she is turning into a girl, I can hear her breathing become quicker. She then kisses me.</p> <p>"We need to go up to my room and get a few clothes off. You know I like this. We haven't done this in a long time." She says laughing a little.</p> <p>"We need to." I say leaning in closer as our tongues dance with each other's. She continues to rub my dick up against her wet pussy. I pull her panties off freeing her.</p> <p>I continue to move my arms up her thighs and start rubbing her thighs, making her move her hips towards my dick. She pushes me away a little. "Come up here." She said. I get up and climb up.</p> <p>"Lay down on the bed." She says to me. I do and lay down next to her.</p> <p>"You are so wet. I thought I might come just looking at your body." She laughs.</p> <p>"Come over here." She says.</p> <p>I crawl over her to her and she pulls at my pants and pushes them and my underwear off. She spreads her legs wide and I'm able to move my lips up her stomach leaving my lips on her flat stomach. She spreads her arms out. I kiss her stomach while I slowly put my tongue between her lips. I slide my lips over her clit and she moans. I slide my fingers down her pussy. I keep a finger up in her and circle her clit with my tongue. I pull her hips closer to me. My other hand goes between her thighsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
