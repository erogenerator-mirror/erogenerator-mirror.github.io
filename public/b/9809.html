I need to talk to you. I want to tell you everything, because I'm trying to save my marriage. I don't want to lose you again. You can't replace me because I love to tease you - or at least play for you. I know that's wrong but I'm not saying it, it's just a fantasy. It is my husband, and I love him so much that I can't stop. And I love you. Maybe I will never look back, just as a matter of fact. I think - if you ever say one thing, I probably won't tell you.</p> <p>I understand if it's uncomfortable for you to hear it. I've had sex with two different men in my life - and I've had sex with more men in the last couple of years since my divorce, than I've had sex in 25 years. In fact, I have never been with five men in one day in each week. When I'm with you and you love me, that's so great, that I have to be crazy."</p> <p>At first he didn't react but when he continued, he let out a big sigh of relief, and continued, "It's a lot more than just sex."</p> <p>He paused for a full minute before he spoke up again, "Look I don't need to justify what I'm having with you. I love you. I'm not saying that I'm married, but I know I'm not a prude, that I can tell you how much I love you. You have to love me for that."</p> <p>I was about to answer when he interrupted, "Please don't tell me you want to sleep with me. That would be wrong."</p> <p>I took some time to think that he truly thought I was not serious, but after a couple of seconds he continued, "That was the first time. It was almost eight years ago. I've been with guys in my late fifties for almost a decade and most of them weren't very good. I think many of them are married and I guess you can't be my first."</p> <p>"I'm sorry. I know that. I'm just a bit surprised."</p> <p>"I didn't say I wasn't being faithful. But I really enjoy it, as I've said very, very much. I would like to have some time in your company."</p> <p>"Really? I don't know about that."</p> <p>"Sure. I'll call you. In the morning. We'll just text each other on the way to the bar."</p> <p>With that, he headed back to his room and I continued to think that it wasn't a good idea to tell him that I wasn't serious.</p> <p>I woke up Sunday morning in the best way possible. The morning sun was shining through the window. I got out of bed, checked my dresser before returning to the bed to get out my clothes.</p> <p>I didn't bother putting on my robe. I left it in the closet. When I went back to the dresser, I was surprised to see what had been laying down there the night before. I picked up the clothes and checked them. There was my robe, one of my bras and a pair of panties. I didn't even look at my underwear, for a few seconds.</p> <p>"Thank you. Oh, that felt good, didn't it?" As I turned to leave the room, I noticed him looking at me, still dressed as I was.</p> <p>"I was hoping for just one or two words, not four. Good morning." I told him and hurried out the door, just before I closed it, he held his hand out for me. With me turning him around, he stopped me.</p> <p>"Where's my robe?"</p> <p>"I don't know." He said as he grabbed my hand and led me into the bedroom. I put down the clothes on the bed then turned to face him, "What's going on at work?"</p> <p>He pulled me to him and kissed me, wrapping my robe around me. I kissed him back and felt him put his hand on my stomach, sliding gently up to my side. Then it was on my right breast, cupping it with his hand. When I felt his fingers circle my nipple, a jolt of electricity ran through my body.</p> <p>He kept kissing me until I couldn't take it anymore. I kissed him back, then pushed him away, pulling him close. We broke our kiss and I said, "Are you sure you want to do this?"</p> <p>He didn't know what to answer me, and just shrugged, I felt his body quivering when he said, "I want to."</p> <p>We started to undress each other again, each one in turn. First, he took off each of my shoesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
