Well, not really."</p> <p>"Oh, no panties you haven't seen before. And I have seen plenty of girls wearing panties at that gym."</p> <p>His voice was so deep that I could feel his heartbeat through the air. "I wasn't aware of that, you know, just an old boyfriend."</p> <p>"Oh, my. How old are you?"</p> <p>"Thirty-six." His hand slipped between us and into my panties. I had to close my eyes and shiver as he gently pushed in, making me take a second deep breath.</p> <p>"I've only been with a few other women. The last two were young. How old are you?"</p> <p>"Thirty-eight." I opened my eyes to see the familiar gleam of his, but his face was still hidden by his mustache. "I was raised to be proper but when I got married to you I realized that there was a good reason I had to wear panties under my dress."</p> <p>We were quiet for a moment and then he leaned in and kissed me softly. "You are special, my Angel. I really feel like I'm falling for you." His tongue lapped, first one and then the other. I had started to move toward his lips when he pulled away from me.</p> <p>He was looking into my eyes. "I'm very, very grateful for this. Thank you for giving me a chance." I was confused.</p> <p>"I'm glad you accepted my invitation to come to the beach with me today." I felt his arms going about my face. I was still too uncertain to trust his confidence. He looked at my face as he kissed me again. "Are you happy?" He asked.</p> <p>"Very much so." He was looking me up and down. "Are you going to wear panties while you're here?"</p> <p>I nodded, "I guess."</p> <p>"Good. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll stop and fetch you and the kids." His fingers found my panties under the satin fabric. He had started unbuttoning them on his way over to his bag and pulled the hem of them down a little, and then started pushing them down. I raised my bottom up for him and he pulled them off me slowly. I stood in front of him now, naked except for a thin white silk robe, a bit lower than the skirt I'd worn when we started the beach.</p> <p>"It's nice to see the kids out here." His tone was playful.</p> <p>I blushed at his attention, but didn't make a move to cover myself, which made him pause. He looked down at me and I felt a small shudder run through me at his touch. "Don't you want to know the story?" I nodded. He smiled.</p> <p>"When I got to the beach I could see about twenty feet of people at one end of the beach. I could hear them calling out our names, and I had to look to see who was calling us all. It was a little creepy but they had been on me for most of the day, getting me to go to the beach."</p> <p>I was feeling ashamed of how much we had shared and I realized that I probably did want to meet the people I had seen, maybe even the ones I didn't know. "And how would you know all this?"</p> <p>"Just by being in my apartment." He handed me his cell phone. "Just dial this number and you will have a new number. See you tomorrow, and no more lies and excuses. You will keep your word. Oh, and if you think there's one more thing, don't forget to bring a camera with you, I just came from the gym a few hours ago." He winked at me and then stood up and started to walk away.</p> <p>"But," I began. "If...if there's anything I can do to help..."</p> <p>"You can do whatever you want. You don't have to do anything. Just take whatever you want."</p> <p>It was all he said so I decided to try a little humor on him by smiling and showing some cleavage. "Can you get me a towel for the kids?"</p> <p>"I'll take that, I guess. There is a bottle of water in the other room so..."</p> <p>I followed him out to the back. There wasn't much left to do, but I just didn't want to give him the "I'm sorry" vibe. I put the other towel on the table near the sliding door which had to be ajar from here. It was about two inches thick, and looked like it would split me in two. There was a long narrow gap between the front and back of the door where a towel hung. I closed the door and handedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
