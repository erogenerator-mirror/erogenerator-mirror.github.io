He felt bad for having had to deal with a woman so young. She might have started out that way. He looked back at his computer and realized she had left the door open. Damn. What had happened in there? How on earth could he find her again, now that he was the head of the community? He saw her enter, still naked from the bath, and he turned back to get his magazine. He couldn't take anymore. He needed to make love to her right now. As he watched her walk towards the door, the front door unlocked, and he saw her get in and close it. He went to open the door for her, but the handle turned and locked. He heard her say, "Why don't you come back for a minute, I want to help you finish up, please?" and it took him a second to get over his fear, to be more confident that he could get away with walking her to that house and not calling the cops, and even worse, fucking her instead. Maybe she just wanted him to stay. That's what she said. He walked out, without looking back, and started looking all over the place. He knew she had gone to a friend's house before he got there, but it's hard to imagine it never working out. He thought about leaving, but realized that the neighbors wouldn't bother stopping by to see if she was coming back. If that was her way, he was going to take advantage of it.</p> <p>He found her room, undressed and made his way to it. On the way there, he checked her room and found she had left a spare key for him to use. So, what now? His head, the clothes. He heard, "Let me help you", and walked towards her room. "You can't give me anything, just put the key in the drawer". "Not in your room, in yours", she insisted.</p> <p>He felt relieved that the key would still be in her hand when she finally got out of the shower, and he left her in just a towel. She came back, nude, in a moment or less and looked at him again with lust in her eyes. Her nipples were hard and her pussy wet. He walked right up to her and kissed her on her lips, right on her mouth, and as she started to kiss him back he felt his own nakedness being grabbed. He grabbed a firm handful of her beautiful firm ass and pulled her to him and as she opened her mouth to suck his tongue he sucked hers. She tasted so good, so good. She grabbed his cock and began to stroke it while she suckled his tongue. He got hard as her hand kept moving it up and down, squeezing it firmly while she continued to suck. They were fucking her mouth and tongue like there was no tomorrow, until he felt her take his cock out her mouth and take his balls one by one into her mouth, and then start her sucking on his cock again. He lifted her off the floor so that she was on top, her legs over his shoulders, while she rode him. His hands were free now, and he felt her own cunt as she came, and let his come drip on her pussy. They lay there like that for about twenty seconds, both naked. "God, that was great". He took her back into the bathroom, and made her clean herself off in the shower. He had never wanted anything hotter in his life.</p> <p>The next morning, she went out as usual the time came and everything was normal, even though they had gotten carried away in the shower. After breakfast, she looked at him quizzically. "What happened last night, do you remember?"</p> <p>He smiled and replied, "Yes, and I did it to you, as part of it. I did you first", and she smiled.</p> <p>"Let me ask you something. When I was in there last night, if I had walked in on me, would you have let me into your room at all?" He had never done that.</p> <p>"Hmmm, if you only knew", she said, "but I have a confession to make. I had no idea. But when I checked in on you last night, I saw your cock out of the corner of my eye". She then told him of his earlier sexual acts with her.</p> <p>"If that is the answer to your questions, then no more."</p> <p>"Well, what I'm asking of you is that if I stay at my house for another 4 days, that you let me into your room, undress and fuck me silly all day, let me stay that way, on and on and on. I agree with you on that last point, or else you would have me locked in your bedroom in the morningâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
