His lips closed about hers again and he leaned down for a taste. He wanted her to be wet and eager for him. "I'll leave that to you. But I'll leave this to you."</p> <p>"I'm going to leave yours to him," she told him. "I think you're going to have fun with him."</p> <p>"I'm going to go with him," he told her. "Because I'm going to have fun with you."</p> <p>"I know you will. But right now, I want you inside me."</p> <p>They kissed again for a few moments, but he didn't pull back just yet. He wanted to do just that. Her body tightened again. She moaned, knowing what she wanted. She couldn't take it anymore! She wrapped her legs around him and pulled him inside her again, pushing him against her. His fingers teased her nipples, the roughness and tautness exciting as he felt her body react to his touch.</p> <p>"Do you know what that is, sweet thing?" she purred.</p> <p>"Mmm."</p> <p>He laughed. "You could ask." He lowered himself carefully onto her, feeling the walls of her pussy contract around him, knowing that she'd be very ready for him by the time he was done. She reached up and pulled him down to kiss him. His cock slid easily back into her, and she moaned again. He kissed her neck a little as he started to move again and she moaned loudly. "Oh god, that feels so good! Don't stop!"</p> <p>"You just want to cum inside me again, aren't you?" she said playfully.</p> <p>He kissed her again, and answered her, "Yes!" When he pulled away from her, she knew he was done. "Wait," she spoke to him. "I want you to come inside me again." He moved his hand to place it on her breast again. She moaned. His hand moved it slowly, teasingly, and he began to roll her nipple. His breathing became quicker as he moved his hand, and he felt the wetness inside her.</p> <p>"Are you going to cum inside me again?" she asked. His fingers teased her hard nipple, and he groaned as he tried to push back against her.</p> <p>"Yes," he moaned. "I'll come inside you again," he told her once this last statement was out of his mouth. He moved his fingers against her hardening nipple, feeling her body jerk with the touch again, and she groaned louder.</p> <p>"Is that good?" she asked him. The voice on the phone was the same one she felt in his body, as well as in hers. It seemed to be in her and her words weren't helping.</p> <p>"Yes," he answered her with a groan. His hand moved from her breast, making it hard for her to speak as her other hand reached for the front of himself. He groaned again as he touched her skin, the wetness and warmth of her arousal flowing over him as he touched her.</p> <p>"Are you going to do me again?" he asked the voice. The man on the other end was obviously watching the two of them. He had his pants pushed down with his other hand, his face smiling down at their motionless fucking.</p> <p>"I'm going to do you again," he told her again. The man's voice came in a whisper this time. "Doing her, I meant, not you, but you." He was so excited to hear him calling her a whore again. "Do you know what that is?"</p> <p>"No, baby," her voice was tight with the strain of needing him inside of her again.</p> <p>"She did it again," his hand slid down her body again. He could smell her; fresh, not fresh, not fresh, not fresh! It brought an excitement to him that he didn't feel in him the night before. There was no shame. She was as sexy as him. His mouth began to water as he watched himself with the man on the phone.</p> <p>"Are you wet again?" he groaned. She wanted him to touch her again. "Do you have a condom?" His fingers slid inside of her again. She didn't need to tell him to lie down and wait. He wasn't the shy virgin he was that night. "Do you need a chance, sweet thing?" He continued to whisper. He was so turned on as he touched her, the hardness of his erection inside her again. "Is this what it feels like with him?" Her fingers played with her clit as he slid inside.</p> <p>"I...I...." he felt himself tighten and knew that she was getting close again.
