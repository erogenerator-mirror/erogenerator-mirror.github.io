I looked up at my wife and my eye was level with her nipple. She gave it a slight tug and a slight pull as it hardened. She looked up at me to make sure I couldn't see her smile. Then she looked down at her nipples and started rubbing them slowly, up, down, and back again. The look on her face was one of anticipation and sexual arousal and I knew she was getting turned on again. I kept my gaze on the floor for several minutes as my wife's eyes never seemed to leave my cock. Finally she looked up at my cock, raised her hand and stroked my shaft a few times and said, "Look at that, Jim. I'd say you've got at least nine inches in there."</p> <p>I nodded in agreement. "I do," I said, "it looks as long as you have a nice fat dick." She took me by the hand and led me to the bedroom. Then she sat down and started spreading lubricant all over my cock and balls. She put down a washcloth and squirted it on my cock, making sure it wasn't too wet. She took the washcloth back over to the bathroom, put her hand over mine and said, "Shower."</p> <p>When we got to the bathroom there was quite a difference, I mean we had the whole place to ourselves. I turned on the shower and the warm shower water as we got it on. She gave me the same hand shower. She was still stroking me through the water as we waited. The shower curtain pulled apart as she was pulling it open. She took the soap suds and ran her hands over me. It was warm and felt soothing on my skin. She started lathering it up with some sort of lather and I could feel her fingers running through my pubic hair. She stroked my balls as she did, and with the water running over them she knew what I liked. After a while the water was clean and started to get me all excited. By now we were both really turned on, I turned her around and did her doggy style. She got her legs in and I got my feet on the floor behind her. I turned her on her back on the shower floor and spread her legs wide and rammed my full length into her. She moaned and grabbed handfuls of the shower-head and started thrusting back at me in rhythm with my hips. This girl knew how to fuck! I looked down to see my cock fucking her pussy. I could see the wetness that ran down her legs. Her expression was a bit of surprise as she realized my cock was sliding in and out of her with ease. My own orgasm was still on its way. Then, after a few minutes of this intense fucking, she whispered in my ear, "Can I... uh, could you... uh... can you come... uh, Jim? Please, Jim,?" Then she got one more good stroke onto my cock as I was getting ready to come before she got the last bit!</p> <p>I felt my sperm starting to boil up through my testicles as I pounded her fast. She was still thrusting the shower head like she was in another position to fuck. Then she wrapped the sudsy wash cloth over my cock and started to really get me going again. After a half dozen strokes I was coming again. We finished showering as I started to climb out on her. She said to help me out of the shower. I did just as she said and stepped with me out of the large walk-in closet. She took me by the hand and we hurried to the bedroom. It was still pretty wet after we put on our bathrobes. She threw me over her face and told me to ride her. I started fucking her as she started to bounce her hips up like a doggy. I put my cock back in her pussy as I felt her start to come with me. I couldn't hold it any longer as I shot a load into my wife. "Cumming!" my wife said, as she came too. We both collapsed in a heap on the bed panting. We got ourselves together and had yet another glass of wine. Then we just laid there as we slowly came down from a fantastic orgasm.</p> <p>When we got off the bed I was just in sweats over her, lying in bed with her on the bed. We never said a word during that hour. She said something to me and I got them a towel. She dried herself off and we laid there on the bed holding each other. She kissed me lightly on the lips. "That was the best sex I've had. It was incredible. Would it be possible for us to do it again?" I thought for a minute. "Well, you know that we don't have to be married anymore. If you want to, we could. We could meet for lunchâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
