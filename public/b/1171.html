I love how beautiful, and you'll look just radiant."</p> <p>He went on, "I love how you've taken pride in your body to begin with, and how you're just looking to make men want your body. You look fantastic, and you're my wife, so I want you to be my wife."</p> <p>"Okay, honey," I said, still in awe, "it's been really hard not to look at you as a woman since I got home today."</p> <p>I looked at him and he smiled back, "you're right," he said, "It's been just as hard as that for you. Just thinking about it and being able to look at you as a woman is really wonderful."</p> <p>My mind was already reeling and my body was heating up and my nipples were begging me to touch myself. I sat there in shocked silence as the man was speaking with a calm voice and looking over at me, "Don't take no crap, honey, you look just radiant, and you're the hottest woman on the planet. I'm going to say that for sure and to the best of my abilities and to not take shit from anyone, and I'll have the entire place to myself."</p> <p>He was so sincere and so open and loving that it just turned my own body on to no end. But then he moved over and sat down next to me on the sofa.</p> <p>"So, you're ready to get divorced?" he asked in mock seriousness.</p> <p>"I'm already ready. I just hope you can convince me to move away."</p> <p>"Your wish, my darling," he said as he took his seat on the sofa next to me and looked directly into my eyes. He put his arm around my shoulder and pulled me closer, holding onto me as my body melted into his as he held onto a side of the sofa.</p> <p>"I'm so happy for you, my darling," he said, and he kissed my lips softly. "How would you feel if I could get rid of that little piece of myself, and that little secret, for a little while?"</p> <p>I opened my mouth to answer his question, but then he continued holding me tight and his lips brushed against mine with a soft wet touch. He started to gently suck and kiss my lips as he looked into my eyes and then kissed his way down my chin and neck and across my collarbone as I held onto the back of the sofa.</p> <p>All around him, the two men were taking their seats as the woman leaned over and kissed my lips, cheeks and mouth tenderly, her lips parting slightly. Their lips parted again and my lips parted with a soft moan, sending a spark of pleasure into their eyes. She licked and nibbled my lip and earlobes tenderly, her hand sliding down toward my breast, and I opened my legs and beckoned her with my legs, inviting her to touch my sex. She didn't hesitate and slowly moved onto the floor and knelt there, her face still a bit unsure, and then I whispered to her, "Would you like for me to be the one to take over for awhile?"</p> <p>"Yes, darling, I trust you. I'll do whatever you want," and she kissed me, "whatever it is you want me to be the one to take over."</p> <p>My eyes were closed as I relaxed with her in my arms, as if in a trance.</p> <p>"Just relax honey, and don't worry about anything, okay?"</p> <p>I opened my eyes to look up at her again as she put her right leg up on the chair beside the sofa and put her hand under my chin, placing my mouth on her nipple, which was rock hard and already standing up as I let my lips slide down.</p> <p>She leaned over and started sucking my nipples as I let my fingers trail up and down her thighs, spreading them as far as they would go as I could. I could feel her hand on my thigh as if she was trying to get a hold of me, but I was already ready for her and wanted to have her.</p> <p>There was no time for slow and steady, though, because she stood up and then leaned over the sofa with her legs spread open. I could see her puffy little pussy lips moving as her arms held onto the sofa, and then they parted slightly as she raised her hips and lowered herself onto my mouth.</p> <p>I opened slowly and let my tongue slide across her lips before I pushed it gently down, allowing it to enter the opening to her pussy. I felt a strange pressure at the opening to her vagina and then it slid slowly and softly. I could feel her body shudder as she touched my tongue with herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
