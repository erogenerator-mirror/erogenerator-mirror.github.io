"But I know you've heard me tell you a lot of things you never should have. But to hear you tell it to me would be quite the start. I know it'd be a pleasure to hear your voice." I held out the bottle. "Please, do not choke on it."</p> <p>"Of course it would," said my cousin. "If you don't want me to spill it, I can just drop a bottle on the floor. And if you don't want me to spill it, I promise I won't."</p> <p>I shook my head. "Nope, you have to have more than one bottle."</p> <p>"Oh, come on then, you'll just pop, and I'll pour."</p> <p>I stood on my tip toes and planted a peck on her nose, not really caring for the taste. She sighed heavily, which I assumed was part of the show. A couple more shots and they would be done, but she said it wasn't important, and neither was I. Then she got serious.</p> <p>"Diane, this is so wrong. I really can't begin to tell you how right you feel about this."</p> <p>"Oh, you can tell me anything. Just tell me that the least you can do is tell me what it is you really don't like about it."</p> <p>"You mean that you don't like it?"</p> <p>"What do you mean it?"</p> <p>"Oh you're the one who's turned off," she said sarcastically. "That's what your father always says. That it's a sin to do these things."</p> <p>"Is it?" I asked. I hadn't noticed she had come up with this line yet. "Why do you think you should do this?"</p> <p>"It's just the way it was supposed to be," she replied. "It's not like we just start having sex. I still love having fun. Not in the wildest of ways."</p> <p>"You wouldn't," I reminded her.</p> <p>"Why?" She was starting to think I was trying to get away with this. "I don't want to do this. I want to do this every day for you. I don't want you to hate me, or feel sorry for me. I want us to be happy, in your bed. And I want it to be just between us."</p> <p>I didn't move.</p> <p>"Please," she said. "Look, it might seem really wrong, and it is wrong, but I promise I'll do everything you tell me."</p> <p>"But-" I began.</p> <p>"But what?" she repeated.</p> <p>"It's okay!" I shouted. "You're my friend and I'm your cousin. It's just that—"</p> <p>"And I know about you and your family," she said. She turned around, and I noticed she had changed out of her shirt. "You don't like looking at my body like this!"</p> <p>I smiled. This is the sort of thing I wouldn't turn down. I'd always told my mother I hated looking at her the way she did. She said that I was too much of a nerd to go through puberty, but I still knew she knew about the fact that I had a huge rack.</p> <p>"And it makes me a bit weak," she added. She sat down on the couch, and I stood up and walked over, taking off my shirt. I held both my hands up in mock respect, and she laughed, but I could tell that I had succeeded. It was a sweet laugh, and it drew a smile.</p> <p>"So," she said with an expression I couldn't see. I knew what she was talking about. "I think you're kind of beautiful and sexy," she said. "I don't care what your parents think. I've never even really liked you. But the fact that you'd put out like this, and say something like this—"</p> <p>She put both of her hands on top of each other, and they were still there, but they were shaking with excitement. "I'm a lesbian," she declared. Her hands left each other and slid downwards. Her thumbs pressed together, in a parody of a hand-job. They were both still, but just looking at each other. "I'm going to be your first cousin."</p> <p>"So?" I said. "Is that how it's going to be for a lot longer?"</p> <p>"I don't know," she said. "I'll get over it, it's the way it's supposed to be. We can just be happy like this. It's not meant to be."</p> <p>What if it makes me less hot? How am I supposed to get over it?</p> <p>"I can show you, but if you don't want me to do this and I can't go—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
