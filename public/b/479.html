It seemed like she was looking for someone. I closed my eyes, and thought perhaps she was more than just her mom.</p> <p>"It's okay, sweetie," she breathed. "You can stay. You can stay in here forever. You won't be hungry. I'm really hungry, and there's plenty here to have."</p> <p>The words were a surprise to me. I felt a little like she'd said I could change places. But I wasn't looking to change back, since I was still just a kid. And yet there was this strange and powerful energy in the air that seemed unfamiliar, but very, very familiar. I'm pretty sure it was that which I was feeling.</p> <p>I closed my eyes and let the warm, comforting words flood my mind. I was not about to let anything be interpreted by it, so I simply allowed it to wash over me.</p> <p>"That's right, honey, come in here," she purred again. I opened my eyes in a flash of light, and saw her standing in front of me, with her head down, and a mischievous grin on her face.</p> <p>"Come in here," she said again, and this time there was a hint of mischief. I didn't know her name, but my imagination couldn't possibly get off my back any clearer than it had already been, and I was trying to imagine her and me here together together. I was being a little frightened at the idea of making love in some way, but I guess I had always been able to be, and now my body was just a conduit for that sensation.</p> <p>"Now, sweetie, get your ass into position," she said. Again I thought maybe she was just teasing, but for some reason I was just happy. I didn't realize that if I leaned forward that I'd be putting my hands over the table, and in that position I actually had something to hold onto. It seemed like I'd been right where I'd left off last winter, when she was teaching me to eat.</p> <p>She was moving closer and closer, and I knew she was watching me. I was being watched, and I didn't try to hide my face anymore. I just felt like I was watching her.</p> <p>"Put your hands on the table," she said softly in my ear. "You really should learn manners."</p> <p>I was not sure if she was referring to me and what I was doing, but her actions were making me feel better. "Do you like that?" she purred.</p> <p>"I don't know if I..."</p> <p>"Then come on, sweetie. Just do as you're told."</p> <p>"But..."</p> <p>She put a finger on my lips.</p> <p>"Please come in here and sit with me for a second, because I really want you to do more than just watch."</p> <p>I could feel my pulse accelerate. I was about to say so. But she wasn't looking at me again, at least not for the first time. She was looking right into my eyes, and I saw her move her hand away from my mouth. Then the warmth of her touch made me so weak I stumbled over my words.</p> <p>"Please, Mommy, sit down," I said softly.</p> <p>I heard her laugh.</p> <p>"I don't need your money! What are you smiling about?"</p> <p>I started to say something, but she placed a finger to her lips, and cut me off before I could get a word out.</p> <p>"Oh no baby, I just heard about your needs and I'm going to let your needs be your demands. Now just sit there a minute."</p> <p>She was not going to say anything, not at all. No, I don't know what I was thinking, that maybe it was something else entirely, a more primal instinct, but this was a part of the game, a part of it where I was forced to get comfortable with my body, as though I had some innate control over it. But all of that melted away, as though there was no more purpose in my desires at that point, even if they came from some sort of primal force. I just sat there, unable to move.</p> <p>She was talking with some sort of sexual tone, but I couldn't tell what it was. Maybe she was enjoying having my body out in the open in public with her eyes riveted on me. Perhaps it was feeling the warm glow of desire, or maybe it was just so far beyond my conscious control, I couldn't tell what it was. It was all too far from my comfort zone.</p> <p>Suddenly, she moved closer to me and said, "So little baby, you can doâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
