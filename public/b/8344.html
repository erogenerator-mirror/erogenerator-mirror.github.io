Are you coming to see this woman again, soon?" the nurse asked. She sounded cheerful, but also seemed a bit sad. I just knew she'd never be the kind of nurse that would go off and leave a patient. I wasn't sure how I felt about that. But before I could do anything else I felt her hands on my shoulders. I don't know who I was expecting, but she was being very friendly and even trying to push me down into the chair. At first I thought she was upset. That's how we met when I came to the hospital but now I realized it's because of her.</p> <p>"What is this?" I asked her, still feeling a bit uneasy at that moment.</p> <p>"Relieving my fears while I waited tables at a coffee shop across the street. You know how hard and busy this week is!" she said, smiling at me and holding me in her hands. I just stared into this beautiful woman's eyes, wondering what it would be like to kiss her. It felt so wonderful to have her there, touching, caressing, kissing, licking, sucking and rubbing.</p> <p>"Yeah, this sucks!" I said and just smiled at her. We began a slow journey down the block to the coffee shop, and as we got closer, it was as if we weren't actually in public but someone could walk by. We got a table right away and the conversation began. We chatted about various topics, and I realized that I didn't really know which to focus my attention on.</p> <p>"So what do you usually do, right here in the cafeteria after the shift?" she asked me, holding the hand of this young nurse that didn't look old enough to be her daughter.</p> <p>"Eh, I don't really know, probably the same places as usual. Mostly, just look into the window and watch the people on the bus."</p> <p>"You look like you want to do that?" she asked, seeming concerned, since she had her left arm around my waist.</p> <p>"Oh, right, yeah, why don't you get a cup of coffee while I finish up my shift. This looks like a nice place, isn't it?"</p> <p>She smiled at me; it was a warm smile, one that showed she's pretty excited. I noticed the white blouse she was wearing a bit larger than what she normally carried with her, but at the same time, that was a nice change. The top of her breast was very pale, and the contrast from her blonde hair was a little bit striking. I noticed that she was wearing a short jacket that covered her chest, and the hem of it made her mid-calf legs look quite long.</p> <p>"Uh, thanks!" I said quickly, not sure if I should have said anything else.</p> <p>"Why thank you," she said in return and handed me a mug of coffee from her tray. "I didn't realize you worked anywhere but here." I sat it at the table, trying to hold back the surge of feeling that came over me.</p> <p>"I used to be in the library when I could have done this!" my friend said as she took out her tablet and typed on it. "I'm not too bad looking in a hospital gown if I do say so myself."</p> <p>"I can't believe you used to work in this town," I whispered, leaning back in my chair and feeling my face flush. "It looks pretty big in here."</p> <p>There was just no point in making it awkward, and I just leaned back and continued to look away. I watched as this young nurse talked with her friend and I found myself trying to look over the other end of a coffee table. It wasn't until I caught the first glimpse of her that I saw my body language change.</p> <p>"Uh, I think you're all done here."</p> <p>"Oh, no, you're not!" she said, not smiling like she knew how I did when she started talking to me. Then she looked me up and down and added. "You look great!"</p> <p>"Thanks, you're sweet!" I heard myself smiling back at her.</p> <p>"Do you mind if I keep you from being too loud?" One of our regular customers asked. I'm sure she was just joking with me</p> <p>"Sure," I finally turned to see who was taking my order and saw a young man that looked as if he wanted to pick up, so I figured I would let him take my order. It quickly became apparent that he was just about to turn his head when I stopped him.</p> <p>"I'd be more than happy to have any coffee left in the tray," I said to him as I began to pick up my order. He just looked at me awkwardly, probably asking whether something was wrong.</p> <p>"I'll be out in a moment," I told him as Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
