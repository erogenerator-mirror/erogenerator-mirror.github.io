I told her and helped her.</p> <p>I made us drinks, which tasted good to me and she took a long drink, then passed me mine.</p> <p>"That wasn't so hard was it?" she asked me.</p> <p>"It sure was. How many men are here that you wouldn't love to be with?" I asked her.</p> <p>"I have not been with a man in over a year, and you just showed me it. I guess I will find a man in a day!" Kelly gushed at me.</p> <p>"Where are you from Kelly?" I asked her.</p> <p>"New York. My name is Kelly and it's my first time here. It is about 1 hour from San Francisco to El Cortez. That's about it!" She exclaimed.</p> <p>"We have to use the hotel room. Let's get inside and see if we can find a good guy in there!" I said pointing at the bar.</p> <p>"You aren't married?" Kelly asked as she walked inside and looked around.</p> <p>"Nope. Why?" she asked, not really expecting to be talking to me about it. I just went with it that I don't smoke but I am a good person.</p> <p>"You are too kind of a gentleman. Is that some kind of commitment or something?" she asked.</p> <p>"No, not for either. I just thought it would be easier if we were in a relationship." I said.</p> <p>She laughed with me, then looked at the bar and smiled. "I am sure you have found some man that you would like to be with. I think that is all the time you have been with guys that you've had. It will be nice to find some guy that you like to be with!" she said.</p> <p>"Yes I have, and some of them are a bit of a pain in the ass. I just can't help it! My girlfriends are all over me, asking me about anything!" I told her in an exasperated voice.</p> <p>"I think you would like to be with a MAN, just with me there!" she smiled and ran back into the bar to sit down.</p> <p>I went and got the room key and went back into the bar.</p> <p>"This way!" I told her as I closed the door.</p> <p>We took the elevator upstairs and walked into the room. The room was huge, at least a king or four, and huge! We took our clothes off and threw them into a corner. We looked around and found a single bed with a soft-sided pillow and some drawers that I was sure were used for other things.</p> <p>"What do you want me to do?" I asked her.</p> <p>"You want to look at something else?" she said.</p> <p>"I have no problem just doing it for the first time in my life!" I told her.</p> <p>"That is so cool! A bed just can't do for everything!" Kelly exclaimed.</p> <p>"You like all of this, it really makes me feel a lot better," I told her.</p> <p>"It really can't hurt!" she exclaimed.</p> <p>"I don't know if I am being honest to you," I admitted.</p> <p>"It can if you are willing to do the same thing that I did. But I don't give a damn if you think it will hurt," I said her.</p> <p>Kelly didn't answer right away, just looked at me and smiled. I started to caress her left breast slowly. Her body shivered with pleasure at my touch. "This is so nice, it could be fun, but it is not!" she said.</p> <p>I caressed the softness of her left breast further and lower. Kelly moaned as I gently cupped her bare mound and then slid a finger down to her wet slit. She shuddered and closed her eyes at the same time. "I can do it." she whispered to me.</p> <p>I continued on my journey down her firm body until I reached her flat stomach. Kelly was wearing a pair of flimsy shorts and a sports bra. I felt a shiver go through her lower body as my head moved closer and closer to her center. "I think you could do it", she told me and pulled me closer. Her hands found the button of my shorts and she unfastened the button with ease. The zipper was quickly undone. My shorts were soon down around my ankles.</p> <p>Kelly's small right breast looked so nice, I couldn't wait to kiss it. I put my hands on them, kneading them softly.
