That was all I could say. I loved him, how could I say that? I mean, I did cum and I still want this, but my body will make the decision. My mouth still craves his cock and yet it doesn't feel bad enough for now.</p> <p>A small moan of pleasure and arousal escapes from my lips. "Mmmm yes baby, you're cumming." I moan again as I feel him grow harder and harder with his fingers between my legs. God it feels so wonderful. All I want is to feel him cum, to feel him slide deep inside and feel him fill me with his cum, so I can feel it.</p> <p>"I love your cock." I moan and press my face up close to his. I hear him groan loudly. "OHhhhhh fuuuuccckkkk fuckkkk yeeeaaaah!" The first one was coming and I'm surprised I'm starting off as well.</p> <p>My first shot shoots a little up on my nose before it hits the top of my mouth. His next blast hits my tongue. The next shot lands on my tongue. Each one lands in my mouth on my closed mouth. The cum slowly coats my tongue and then slide down to the back of my throat. I swallow as he pulls out to his cock head and I begin to lick up his sperm.</p> <p>"Oh baby!" I moan as he pushes his cock against my lips. I lick and suck, taking more of his hot seed from him and loving the taste and the texture. He pulls out and I slide my mouth off his cock head.</p> <p>"God you taste so good baby, and I know you love being my cum slut."</p> <p>I don't say anything, or hesitate, I just hold him. I love how he touches me, I love him touching me, even when he's not there, I get that feeling, every time I get his touch it's just so damn good. He reaches down to pull me up and he kisses me for a long moment and then he gets up again.</p> <p>"That was so good and I have one more thing to do." He says and he turns around, putting his hands on the bed as he rises. I know what that might be, and I watch him go, wondering what he thinks about it.</p> <p>I do wonder what that might be though and I can't wait to wait.</p> <p>Chapter Six:</p> <p>I get up and sit in front of the computer thinking about it. The thought of being a slut, what is really happening to me, is something I never thought I would ever be able to be.</p> <p>The computer comes to life as I see the screen from my computer's monitor. It's been quite a while. What the hell does the software do?</p> <p>The screen comes up as I enter the information and the display says 'New Message' it said. 'All new messages from Mr. Smith' as it says, and I have already put them all under 'New Message'.</p> <p>So what has that got to do with me, all he has to do is click the buttons and then the message comes to lifeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
