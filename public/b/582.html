His cock sank in deeper, stretching her as it penetrated her, a feeling she'd always found arousing and exciting and which quickly turned to pleasure when he pressed himself against the sensitive skin at the top of her pussy, feeling his balls bump against her ass. Her pussy clenched around it, gripping, as she felt the first of his strokes, he pressing himself all the way inside her. As they held the position, she slowly rotated her hips up and down, meeting him, taking him all the way to the root of his cock - making him pause as she brought her legs up and back again, rubbing along the base of his cock as his movements started to quicken, making them both feel their arousal increase rapidly as it was the most erotic thing he'd ever felt.</p> <p>Suddenly, he withdrew his cock completely and began to slide his fingers back and forth over hers, rubbing his thumb against her clit, feeling her body shiver as his fingers came into contact with her pussy's swollen lips. He stroked her again, then, gripping her tightly around her waist, he pulled her up, so she was lying on his chest with his cock buried inside her.</p> <p>They started to make love again, slowly, with long slow strokes that they'd both become accustomed to. The next one was even better, his hand on her thigh moving up to her mound, then to her breasts, tweaking her nipples until they were hard and erect before taking her nipples between his teeth and chewing on them, pulling them until they were completely out of his mouth before releasing them again. He did that once or twice more, and she began to moan, her hips rising to meet him as her pussy spread to accommodate him.</p> <p>Just as with the first orgasm she began to ride him quickly, her body taking control over her once more, but as he began fucking her with long slow strokes, she began screaming with her first orgasm of the evening, cumming almost continuously. As he moved his cock deep inside her again, he felt his thumb at her clit, rolling it back and forth, her hips lifting to meet him each time he plunged deep inside her and fucked her with slow strokes, knowing she was a woman who craved pleasure.</p> <p>She cried out again and the first orgasm hit her like a freight train, her whole body shaking, her knees clamping around his waist, her muscles tightening and bunching on his cock, making it even harder to do what he wanted her to do. As he began to fuck her again with the same rhythm, she began to moan again; her body going into spasms around his cock while she came again and again, his thumb moving faster over her hood until she couldn't help herself, as she came again, he felt her body shaking and then quivering, her pussy gripping his cock so tightly he could feel himself almost ready to explode when she screamed out, her body shaking even harder and her legs pumping up and down on his chest for all she was worth until her shaking subsided.</p> <p>As the first waves of her orgasm subsided, with a shuddering sigh, she sat still for a moment and, as he withdrew her cock from her pussy and began to stroke the sensitive skin where it joined her pussy, she heard him moan, the sound a signal for her to let go, knowing it meant she wanted him to cum to her. She knew that he wanted to cum to her, too... he had already cum once... and so she wanted it again, regardless of his own need to cum. As the throbbing of his cock faded, he began to lift his hips to meet hers again, and she moaned again as she felt him slam deep inside her, her body responding to him with its own, her pussy tightening its grip on his body and she felt his balls contract and his cock swell inside her, and she heard him moaning himself, his own body jerking as his cock shot its hot load deep inside her.</p> <p>They held each other as the tremors continued through their climaxes, her heart fluttering, their breathing coming quickly, feeling each other's bodies shudder as tremors ran through them. She felt every pulse of his cock as it pulsed against her, the softness of his chest against her breasts and his heart racing as they held each other, just as they always had, but now it was her turn again, as he rolled her onto her back, as he kissed, teased and caressed and kissed and kissed her until the tremors passed and she was completely still, until she felt his warm weight again on top of her, as he rubbed the tip of her swollen clit with his thumb, feeling himself harden again inside her as he kissed her.</p> <p>"I think we got it," he whispered, as his cock slipped out of her for aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
