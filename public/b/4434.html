She was thankful there were no other patrons nearby.</p> <p>"You want to go up to my room?" His eyes followed her as she made her way up the stairs, a bit of a smirk on her face. "I'll take that as a yes. But just for a little fun, what did you have in mind?"</p> <p>"Just to keep you company while I'm at work." Was that a double entendre or an honest hint that you'd want to come out to the motel with her? "I can use the bathroom."</p> <p>He looked over his shoulder and said "See you in the morning."</p> <p>She gave him a half giggle, "I'll take your offer."</p> <p>He leaned over and kissed her on the cheek before starting up the stairs. "Thanks for the show, Sara."</p> <p>With that he started to climb the final flight, his hand finding her bare, soft cheek. He paused in the doorway to look at her while he finished his cigarette before continuing to smoke and sip his beer. "I'm not going to say anything to anybody."</p> <p>"You should not be drinking or smoking." She smiled as she entered the bathroom, the first thing she did as she finished the shower was make sure to turn a little steam on in case she had to go to her husband's office.</p> <p>He closed the door as soon as he heard the water running.</p> <p>"Sorry, I only have thirty minutes. I'll have my coat, I'll be right down. And, we can be together in the shower together the rest of the day." And she smiled a knowing smile.</p> <p>He was just about to enter her stall when he heard the door lock. And to think the whole world was her shower, he'd never want to get this chance again.</p> <p>He finished his drink and slipped out. Not wishing to waste his time.</p> <p>It was a hot, sunny day. He was the middle of the night. Her bathroom was across the street from the office but he knew he didn't get in the city before noon.</p> <p>His shoes hit the pavement. He'd been in the habit of making his way up to the office, where she waited to collect her coat on the counter. It was nearly seven.</p> <p>He sat at the desk with a small coffee mug filled with his own strong scotch. The office seemed a little out of place, compared to the hotel that was across the street. That was probably what she'd been trying to say, or so he'd hoped, but he would have said something else.</p> <p>She was standing in the doorway to the bathroom. Her skirt still wrapped around her, his eyes were drawn to her bare arms as her shoulders moved as she approached him. He could see the curve of her arm. The movement meant she was swaying seductively. He glanced at her chest and could see that the material had risen higher and her nipples were straining the soft fabric of her bra.</p> <p>"Can we finish in here in the shower?" Her words didn't matter if she meant a quick wash, or a long wet kiss. He could see the smile playing across her lips and knew she was serious. They didn't last long, both having to re-arrange something. But, they were just too sexy.</p> <p>"Sure," she replied, standing at the base of the glass door. She held her hands out, taking him by the hand as he stood, following her up. "Are you sure?"</p> <p>She had a hand up the back of his jacket hem, lifting his tee shirt in the process, heaving into her hand as he did his best to lift the material with his other hand. It wasn't a big deal, he'd managed to wear it. The jacket went off in his haste to get the jacket off.</p> <p>He'd worn it for a purpose, knowing she didn't like it. But she couldn't help but see the large tent forming in his trunks. "I'll take that as a yes."</p> <p>She smiled and pulled him closer, kissing him on the neck as his hand made its way to cup her ass. "Let's not waste a chance."</p> <p>She stepped closer, kissing his neck again. "Let's put my jacket back on." She pressed closer into him, her head bent from the side and her lips seeking his.</p> <p>"Let me finish getting some things set up first."</p> <p>She released him and helped him off his jacket while he removed his shirt. It fit a little snug against her body but was no problem, as his jeans seemed to hold in the fact that they were more than just jeans.
