I'm going to offer you an opportunity to spend a few weeks with me. And that will include some clothing for you."</p> <p>I'm trying not to sound like I'm doing this on my own, but I can still see a chance where the other shoe might fall. I guess we are getting a bit more aggressive with our relationship, but that's probably as far as I'll ever get. The way it is, I don't have much of an advantage in the bedroom, since I'm always pretty flexible and have very little self discipline when it comes to sex.</p> <p>"Uh...OK, but do it in person. But you won't have to do the stripping," I point out in the most reasonable of terms. "I mean...you can wear your clothes when you come over and over to the store. It's not like it changes anything. They just let me show off my body, so I don't really get all naked all the time."</p> <p>"That sounds great. I'll be right there with you!" She adds enthusiastically.</p> <p>"I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to this place!" I assure her. "But I should warn you, you have to keep in mind that you can't do this without me being there. And I promise to be at your disposal. There's a chance we can be friends this weekend, and that might give that back to you some time when you'll get a chance to see me. It's just a business deal."</p> <p>"Sounds good to me. But do you have any instructions?" she asks, her eyes sparkling as she looks at me.</p> <p>"Uh, no," I reply, but don't hesitate to add, "There's no pressure to do anything when you're with me, but you have nothing to hide. You'll do as I say without doing anything that you're not comfortable with. You're just the one who gets to watch this deal, and whatever happens, happens. If you don't like it, you don't have to."</p> <p>"Ok, it sounds great," she says, and we both turn to go. "But I'm sure I'll be able to keep this conversation private."</p> <p>"That's right," I say, patting her ass to emphasize the sentiment. "In fact, I think we have another chance to work this out."</p> <p>"Oh my God! You're right! We have to get some stuff together!" she says, excitedly. "I really am looking forward to this."</p> <p>I smile and shake my head in agreement, and nod to her as the two of us drive along the river. When we get inside, we immediately turn on the lights and go into the bedroom. We don't even bother unbuttoning our dresses while we are there first, though when we first shed them, we make quite certain we don't take any time at all to remove anything.</p> <p>"Just be quiet," I instruct her, when the lighting becomes dim and we take our time undressing. "No one will interrupt, even if they know we're going to be naked together. The more clothes we take, the bigger this will be. You'll be the center of attention."</p> <p>"Ok, I guess," she says, and goes to put her dress back on.</p> <p>"I need a little something for the trip from here," I suggest, pulling my t-shirt over my head, the fabric sliding over my skin even as I do it, "so let's let's get a little more comfortable. Why don't you put some of my shirt on with your bra underneath? That way you can keep me from getting too distracted."</p> <p>"You got it," she says as she turns around to help me get my shirt back on, "I can't keep getting distracted just by putting my clothes on."</p> <p>I smile and tell her, "It's more fun when you get distracted, than it is standing in front of a stranger wearing nothing but a t-shirt," and I lead her back to the bed and get back between her legs, taking my place between her legs.</p> <p>"Oh, that feels so good," she moans, and I can see her juices beginning to form on her pussy as we sit a while looking at her. I take my time licking, tasting, and teasing her pussy with my tongue while playing with her nipples and massaging my hands along side hers.</p> <p>She grabs the back of my hair as I continue moving my tongue deeper, and I feel her pull on my hair, encouraging me inside her body as a sign that she wants me to continue doing what I'm doing. Her body trembles and quivers under my tongue as she moans and grinds her legs against my head, holding my head to her mound while the other three fingers of my right hand find themselves in her pussyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
