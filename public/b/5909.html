She wasn't sure she could take seeing his hand slide over her left thigh right up to her crotch. But when she realized it was only his hand and not his hand going to her pussy, she let out a low moan. He didn't disappoint her.</p> <p>He slowly slid his hand up to the top of her skirt, and then gently moved his hand back down. After a minute her pussy started to get tingly.</p> <p>"We could get a room" said a voice from around the corner.</p> <p>He turned toward her, "We could go," and said so quietly she didn't hear him.</p> <p>And so, he did it again and again and again. She was getting wetter and wetter. She knew he could feel it. She knew he was getting turned on by her reactions. At just the beginning she was beginning to get annoyed and then she became frustrated. She was frustrated because he kept trying. He kept trying to slide her skirt up the rest of the way. And she was getting frustrated because he kept on trying. She was having a hard time trying to hold it back to stop him.</p> <p>There it was again.</p> <p>"Just go" she thought. She knew it. He was going to come in his pants. He wasn't going to be able to wait a minute longer. She opened her legs, not wanting to be pushed that far. He slid his hand under her ass, then cupped the left one. He lifted her right cheek. It was still tingling. He moved his hand to the outside of her leg and her body tensed.</p> <p>"It's ok," he said soothingly.</p> <p>"Yes, I'm ok, just go now!" she said more firmly and then almost pleadingly.</p> <p>He was very gentle, putting his hand in her out, rubbing her inner leg up and down with his hand, his fingers softly caressing her pussy lips, then his hand came up her thigh pushing her skirt further up.</p> <p>"Ohh! Go now ... go now!" she thought.</p> <p>His hand continued to slide under her skirt, over the right part to where the hem came up, and then slid up to the crotch of her panties. She realized it was now his hand. No one had ever done anything to her pussy before. The feeling was overpowering, and she instinctively spread her legs further apart and pushed her hips up to meet his hand.</p> <p>He held the hem of her skirt up for a second longer, and then slowly slide it up her body. It's cool air was now coming off her nakedness. The top of her thigh came into view. That's it, she thought. He has the hots for me. He has the hots for me too.</p> <p>He kept caressing her pussy with both hands. And then, suddenly, he put his other hand on her knee, and pushed her body down.</p> <p>"Not so fast!" she said but wasn't going to protest. A little too late. One of his hands went up her thigh, and then back down. The other hand was now on the front of her panties and pressing against it. She wanted it more than anything. He was so forceful, so thorough and so forceful and she just about lost control. But she didn't let it end. It didn't end.</p> <p>"Ooohh!"she groaned when he slipped one finger under the fabric. "Yes, very nice." She could not help but to lean forward, spreading her legs further.</p> <p>He started rubbing her clit with his fingers as if he was a lover, and her hips started bucking as she pushed her pussy into his hand. He reached down and pushed his finger into her wet hole as far as it would go. He pumped his finger in and out of her as she continued to grind into his hand. She could feel herself getting very wet. Her hands had moved back down to her thighs to touch her skin, and she had spread her legs even further apart.</p> <p>Now it was his turn to feel his breath being forced out of his lungs as he tried to keep pace with her. It seemed to happen at the pace it would. She couldn't believe she was getting herself into this. His finger was inside her all the way, and in fact inside her all the way. He was going to find out if she could take it any deeper.</p> <p>She felt it -- in the way that one finger must have been inside her. And they found his hand, sliding up and down the outside of her leg at the very top. He kept going. He was really going to fuck her with his finger on the very top.</p> <p>"Ohhhhh ... ohhhh! Ohhhh...!" was all he could say at this point. At the same moment he found her clit and started rubbing it. He had found it, and she was loving itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
