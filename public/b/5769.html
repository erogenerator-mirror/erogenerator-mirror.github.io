Her face was bright red with embarrassment. She had never been told that she was beautiful without being ashamed. Sophie knew it was silly. She had never thought a person of means could be attractive, but now that the question was settled it seemed that there were other facets of Sophie's personality that most people had not considered. This was why she had a friend. This was all for her. This was all for her.</p> <p>Sophie did love a man that did not mean to be selfish. She had met an understanding and caring man, though at that time she had been the one who took advantage of the situation. She had spent time with the one man whose actions meant something different than it did to her. It is hard to describe, but she felt it. Her heart raced as she pictured him licking her pussy. His lips felt like warm oil and she wished that he would kiss it. It was so much better to be kissed, instead of having a cock. If she had been able to control herself, she would have done what she wanted, but if she had had to be so selfish as to do this, and this was a huge risk, the risk was too great, and if she was so selfish, then there wouldn't have got through to her with it.</p> <p>Sophie reached over with her free hand for the vibrator. She touched the tip and started it. It vibrated like little butterflies in her stomach. She tried to imagine what the vibrations were doing to her clit was doing to him, she wished she could feel the vibrations all through her body.</p> <p>She heard the door open and closed again from the noise of it, but she knew that Sophie had gone back to the kitchen to get something ready. As she lay there waiting for the vibrator to take off this awkward situation with another person; her hand, and now with someone else playing with her pussy, she imagined it was one of the other men who she would be. "Would it help?" she wondered to herself, "Would it make him feel good?"</p> <p>Sophie arrived with a tray filled with the few things that she wanted to make and some clothes. She brought the tray over as she was leaving and handed a hand towel over to Sophie. "Just a sec," she told the girl. Sophie was dressed in a pair of tight leggings, but had removed the jumper in order to wear only their underwear, which she was wearing underneath. Her face was flushed bright pink and her eyes were sparkling with excitement.</p> <p>Sophie placed the clothes on the bed. "Don't change," she admonished Sophie. "Don't lose any of it." The clothes didn't look as if they should have gone, but they did, and Sophie's face glowed bright pink as if some of the colors had been chosen. When Sophie had put the clothes in the car, she had seen that if she turned around, she still saw her eyes, but she no longer saw the look of innocence that she had seen the first night she walked up to the apartment. "Don't let him down now, will you Sophie?" she purred in her best girl's accent. The sound was all it took for Sophie to jump. She had barely taken one step into the bedroom before her lips found Sophie's. The moment the kiss ended, Sophie pulled the other girl closer and the kiss was deep and passionate, but just as she expected from this position, Sophie had her lips so close to Sophie's that they seemed impossible to stop. Every time they were kissing, the kiss seemed to go on forever. She was just as eager to kiss her friend as to lick her. Not that their kiss had changed anything. The kissing had just escalated even more, and Sophie was eager to try to kiss Sophie's nipples. Sophie's tongue, and when the man's tongue touched her nipple, she almost screamed for joy.</p> <p>She would have fallen to the bed with an orgasm, but she controlled herself, keeping her eyes on the ceiling mirror which would now be looking back at her over Sophie's shoulder as she laid there in pleasure. She looked back over her shoulder towards the apartment door and could see him, his hand stroking his cock as she watched. She quickly covered her mouth with her hands to stifle her scream.</p> <p>They stood up and walked into the apartment. He had changed out of his uniform and dressed for work on a new day. Sophie went out and got her own key and unlocked the door to the apartment. Sophie stopped and turned to her. "Is he still here?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes," Sophie chuckled. "He's upstairs. He'll be down to the car by now if he doesn't mind." She led the way into the apartment again, and took Sophie's arm and lead her to the lounge chair. "Lie down." Sophie didn't argue this time. She leaned over the bed andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
