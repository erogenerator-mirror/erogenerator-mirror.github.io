He pulled her back, not so much with her in front of him, but with her bent on the hot tub railing. Then he flipped her over, her back pressing into the cold stone. His legs were locked behind her and she knew she wasn't doing a very good job of that. He stood up, his hands going to her waist and she watched as his eyes went slowly over her body, his touch still tender from her earlier. He reached down, feeling her hips again, sliding a finger between her lips, rubbing her clit lightly and she almost howled at the contact. He continued to play with her pussy, slipping a finger deeper between her lips, rubbing her clit with his finger tip. Her body shook with the contact, feeling another release coming, the pressure building once more.</p> <p>He stepped out of the water, coming around to kneel in front of her, leaning forward to kiss her. Softly he nibbled on her bottom lip teasing her. His hand slid down over her ribs, down over her stomach, and down to her mound, his fingers sliding into her pussy lips. She came instantly, with a low rasping moan. Taking her chin in his hand and pulling, he forced her to look into his eyes.</p> <p>'Yes', she gasped, her eyes still heavy with lust.</p> <p>'Yes what?' he asked, holding out his other hand.</p> <p>'Yes I want you inside me, inside my hot little cunny.' Her breath hissed in the water as waves of relief washed over her.</p> <p>He smiled, bending closer to her pussy. He lifted her leg, lifting it over both of his shoulders and letting her weight rest firmly on the railing as he lined himself up with her body. He pressed into her, spreading her lips wide as he leaned forward, her hands in his hair pulling him harder into her. He slowly pulled out, teasing her lips before pushing back in. Her hands grabbed his ass, pulling him in tight as he slowly began to slide into her. His hands tangled in her hair, pulling his head back slightly. Her lips found his neck, he could feel her teeth scrape against him lightly for just a second, his hands running through hers as he kissed her. She met him back, her nails lightly scraping on his ass, pulling him deeper inside her. Her legs wrapped themselves around his waist, pulling him in even closer. He held himself there as he felt her nails dig into him as he started to slide out and in again, picking up the pace. Her ass rose into the air, his hands digging into her flesh as he slid in again. His body pressed hard against her, his fingers sliding deep into her as each move pushed her body closer to the edge. This slow but constant, he wanted more and more of her.</p> <p>As he slowly pushed himself in and out of her, her nails had gone down his ass, drawing a finger in between them. They had been rubbing against each other as this slow fucking began, but that finger now had found his anus. She had never toyed with something he did this much before, but the way her body responded to his was unbelievable. His finger slipped into his ass as he felt the finger slip through, finding his prostate. He could feel it rising, his own pleasure building, and feeling the pressure on cock was amazing. His own finger slid into his own ass. Her fingers were now doing the same magic, pulling on his cock with increased urgency.</p> <p>Her body tensed as her orgasm approached. He pulled out and pressed back into her, his cock sliding into her pussy as his fingers were doing a similar job in her body. He knew it was coming, her body tightened around his finger, her breath caught, pulling from her lungs. It seemed like it would never stop. His cock began to spasm, his cock felt like it was going to explode. He knew he had never had anything like this before, and he knew that he wouldn't be able to keep this up for long. He stopped pushing and leaned back, his knees hitting the edge of the hot tub. Her legs slipped off him and came through the hot water as he stood. He wrapped his arms around her, resting his head on her chest, she could tell he was still hard. She loved the feeling of his cock between her legs, the feeling of the cool water between them. He lifted himself to his knees and took ahold of her thighs as he pressed them back against his chest as his weight lowered himself on the pool deck. He held his cock against her pussy as he slid inside her, her hand coming to his face. She was on top now, her lips pressing to him, her tongue reaching up and rubbing over his lips, as she lowered herself onto him. His eyes never left hers as she began to slowly ride him. He could feel her body onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
