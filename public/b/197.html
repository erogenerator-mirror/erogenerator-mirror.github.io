"If I do, I'll just be a little angry and feel like I've been hurt and hurt a lot, but it will be worth it to feel that way."</p> <p>She began to slowly move her arms down again as she ran the bar back up and down her body. I could barely hear anything as I watched her in the mirror and as I watched her moving her arms, moving around I could hear just how soft and silky she was.</p> <p>She moved so slowly that I really couldn't tell whether she was still moving or not and she began to use the bar of soap on her front again. I wondered if she had planned this, what caused me to leave her and when I heard her moan she must have really liked it because she just kept doing it. The more she moved to her hands and arms the more her voice got higher and higher with each second.</p> <p>Finally I felt it. Her legs opened slightly and I could feel her pussy getting wet. With each move of her arm I could hear her breathing getting heavier and she was moaning more and more. I began to move a little so the pressure of her lips made her arch. With every move the weight from her arms seemed to lift, her legs spread farther apart.</p> <p>It was hard to tell with the light in the mirror, but I could tell that her pussy was wet and warm. Her body was so completely relaxed that it was just a little ticklish. I looked at the mirror to see her looking down again in the mirror but she was still moving so much.</p> <p>At the bottom of the bed it seemed like a minute or two before she was fully out of breath and I could hear her let out a little yelp.</p> <p>"That was nice," she said. "There are lots of things I liked about what you have been doing this weekend."</p> <p>It was then that I noticed that she had her bra off and was slowly rubbing herself. "I'm guessing that was one of those 'good to keep,' 'good to make love' things?" she asked.</p> <p>"I guess," I said, looking back at her. "But you still have much better places to go."</p> <p>"Oh, you can be such a pervert," she said. "You could do that for me, too."</p> <p>As she said that she began to lightly run her fingers up her stomach and over her breasts, slowly circling each one and then slowly working her way to her nipples which seemed to get larger. When she finally cupped them in her hands, I could clearly see the outlines of her areolas. I had to turn to the right and look at her face, but her eyes were closed and I heard a little moan.</p> <p>As I looked back, I saw her fingers working her nipples and she was moaning even more. I knew she was about to cum. The thought was just enough to push me over the edge and my own cock grew hard. I began to stroke harder as I watched her fingers working furiously under her bra.</p> <p>I saw her body respond to me, as if she was having an orgasm and her skin began to tingle. I could feel her pussy start to spasm and she let out a little scream as she came.</p> <p>As a part of me felt like I was having this conversation with some guy that I did not know, another part of me wondered what all had gotten into this weekend. I didn't want to get a hard-on thinking it was some guy getting into some hot sex because of what I was watching. But it was not enough to make me feel good about myself. It still felt hot.</p> <p>It was then that the other part of my brain, which I could feel in the mirror, decided I needed to hear back from Susan. I stood up, pulled her to me, put my arms around her, and whispered, "I've thought about how I might take care of you."</p> <p>She leaned back and just smiled and said, "Good."</p> <p>I kissed her on the neck and she ran her fingers through my chest hair. I continued kissing her as slowly I worked my way down her neck and onto her breasts. I pulled back from her slowly, letting her get her breath. With the last drops of water I ran the back of one hand down her stomach to her belly button before moving down to her pussy. She was obviously very wet and I could hear her breathing as the water hit her skin.</p> <p>I slowly ran one finger back up her slit to the top of her lips between my finger and thumb and slid the wetness back down along her slit to her ass. That helped lubricate her a bit and I began to insert my fingers into her. It wasn't as wet as I had imagined, but I was still in the right position when the first wave hit. I felt a twinge, but Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
