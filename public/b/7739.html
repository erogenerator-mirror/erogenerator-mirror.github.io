I didn't stop until my tongue slid completely from her asshole to her clit. I licked and sucked it, pulling it in as if it were a tiny penis. I took it between my lips and sucked on it until she moaned. My fingers probed into her pussy, finding her clit and began to rub it back and forth.</p> <p>"Oh, god, I'm so close already. Oh, please...," she said, trying to force an orgasm from her body.</p> <p>I ignored her request and began thrusting my tongue up into her. It felt as if someone had turned on a switch and was making her body react to the pleasures that I was giving her. She moaned and cried out as she orgasmed all over my mouth. I was getting so excited from eating her asshole I could barely breathe. But the vibrations from her orgasms pushed me over the top, and the feeling of my own climax began to shoot up my cock and down her thighs. I felt the first spray of my hot cum against her thigh, and my hands gripped her hips as I tried to catch as much of it as I could.</p> <p>She moaned and said "Oh, god, it felt as if I had shot out my own cum all over your beautiful face. Thank you, baby. Thank you so much." And she fell onto my chest, still clutching her pussy. I was still hard, and we lay there and kissed for the longest time. I thought I would fall asleep, too, because she suddenly pulled herself up so that she was lying above me.</p> <p>The kiss was wonderful. I caressed her soft skin, kissing her shoulders and arms. I kissed her everywhere on her neck and on down to her breasts, which in turn, were wonderfully covered in her own juices. "I love doing this to you," I said. And she grinned in reply.</p> <p>"I think you do, too, don't you?" she whispered. Then, almost reluctantly, she began to move lower on my stomach. Slowly, gently, she began to move her pussy up and down my hard cock. She took it into her hand and pulled it up and down. I closed my eyes. She watched as she got me nice and hard again. Slowly, she stroked me until I was fully hard again and then lowered herself down so that her pussy was just above my cock. She reached to her pussy and touched my tip with her pussy, and then lowered herself down to the base of my cock. Slowly lowering herself onto me, making little movements with her pussy. She felt me up against her clit, pushing down with her and making herself harder. Then she let me drop a little on the bed.</p> <p>"I want you to fuck me, Jake, now," she said.</p> <p>I was still a little stunned. I was not at all surprised. I felt something as I moved my hips up into her pussy. At first, I saw that I was fucking in her ass. But, then I realized she was fucking something inside her. Her legs wrapped around my ass, pulling me into her. I could feel her orgasm coming, almost as soon as she felt that. She leaned down and we kissed again, and she smiled as our lips parted. Her eyes were still open, but they were glinting up at me as we kissed. Slowly, she began to move up and down my hard cock.</p> <p>"I want you to fuck my ass, right now, Jake."</p> <p>She looked up at me and then down at my cock as it disappeared into her. She took a step back away from me, and I saw she was holding something. It was a strap-on dildo, long and curved, but with the cock in it it could look like a cock. And it looked like it was moving, too. She looked at me and raised her leg. I took it away from her and put it inside the dildo harness.</p> <p>She smiled again as she moved on top of me. I felt the dildo press against my ass as we embraced, moving against each other. I put my hands under her and massaged her breasts. They felt as soft as they looked. She moved down until her pussy was poised just above me. Then she grabbed my cock and pushed it down into her pussy, so that it entered herself. She was a little surprised at the feeling of having a cock in her pussy, but it was quite enough.</p> <p>She began to move her hips as she pushed her body down onto mine. "Oh, yes!" moaned my wife as we were kissing again. The dildo was pushing into me, feeling the same way. She began to moan and cried out as I felt an orgasm starting to build. As I felt my balls tightening I began to thrust up into herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
