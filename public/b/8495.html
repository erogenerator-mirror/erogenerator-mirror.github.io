The bed shifted and she felt me lift her a little, and then I slid in. She let out a tiny scream and I took that as just a warning, I drove it in hard and fast as if I were about to punish her for hurting me. I felt the bed shift again, then the movement of her legs. I leaned back and took her hand and pushed her on top of me so she was now on top of me. I rolled her hips, and it got her so excited she came. She started pumping and it felt nice, but the feeling didn't last long. By this time my dick was fully hard again, and with the movement of her hips and movements I knew I could hold off long enough to feel her release some of the pressure she was feeling just a few seconds before. She was breathing laboriously, and I was not sure if it was because of the fear of what might come next or whatever. When the first shot hit her the intensity was so strong I couldn't hold off much longer. I started pumping the full load into her, and a lot of it got past the top of her as it splashed across her belly and her breasts like it hurt. I pumped her again and she started bucking, and then I stopped, feeling my dick start to go down. Then I pushed back up, and I held onto her.</p> <p>"No don't stop," I said, and she didn't stop. I thought for I was able to hold it, but my stomach was a little heavy and I just lay there on her. She could have fallen asleep again, but I knew she was just too happy to move.</p> <p>"It was a pleasure. Thank you," and it was, and I kissed that face that only made me happy to the world.</p> <p>And I never knew what I was doing with myself as an equal, even.</p> <p>And I didn't know that it was for the best.</p> <p>++++++++++++++++++â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
