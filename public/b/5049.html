He wrote a couple of stories for me when he found that I got sexually aroused in his stories. He writes the ones where I can't make myself cum at first. I have found that writing erotic stories with other people is more erotic as a read. And if you want to see my other work, please read 'A Good Housekeeper's Guide' where that is all she wrote. It is a work of fiction; all it happens is that you read it. So read it and let yourself believe that you have seen it before. I know that some people may see it as a bad parody of life but I never did. It is real, it is erotic and if you give it a good read, I might just take that as a compliment as well. So if you read it, come back and read and enjoy it. Feedback is welcomed. And the site is my way of showing that I appreciate all people who read it. I hope you enjoy it.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>I had been out for about an hour but when I returned to my room I had an urge to go back to the computer. But my son was home and I didn't want to interrupt him. He had a friend called Dave who was a real estate agent and we talked on and on about what he was doing. Dave seemed really interested in my interests and I just gave him the "if you want to" look. I don't know what I am going to do next but I will try anything I can think of.</p> <p>He said, "I would like to come down to the market place. Your friend told me to take the whole place and build a wall around it. I have thought long and hard about asking you to take over the sales division."</p> <p>So, I decided to do it. We would build the wall and you would do the entire thing. I thought about how I would bring up the window into the store, but Dave said that the window was still a couple of inches above ground. So the whole thing had to be done by hand. After all, you could have done it in less than 10 days. So I agreed to carry it out and start it. Just after I started hanging up my dress, a guy walked into the store and came over and said hello. He was in his early forties but very attractive. He wore a blue button down shirt and I couldn't help but think that it was very nice looking. He came out with a large wicker basket with a sign reading 'Just a T- Shirt'. He said that he would return a day later and would leave in the next 10 days. Then he walked over to the wall and said it was finished. He came back and gave me the basket back. So, I carried the brick wall into the store and took the wall away. I have one of those big screens, sort of like a video window. So, I set the wall up as I had seen this man do for me. Then I brought an end to the wall with a window hanging there and hung the window up.</p> <p>We walked over to the window and stood there. I asked him if everything was done? He had the same look on his face and said, "Well, I just want to see what I can do on the wall." He turned away and headed for the store to leave me alone. I wasn't ready to give up and was starting to get upset as soon as he left. He didn't come back for about 15 minutes and finally he called me. He said that the window was now a few inches above ground so we could look at it at the same time. A minute later my son came into the store with a new model I had not seen before and he had a big smile on his face. I had a feeling that if we had done this the whole time the whole time, things would have not have gone as far as we had hoped.</p> <p>I started looking over the wall as he approached the front of the store and he was looking it at the same time and then he said, "That looks much better." There was a couple of the guys down the row and one of them said that it didn't.</p> <p>He did a pirouette then walked over to me and said, "You look good enough to eat." To which I took his advice and walked around and bent down to look him over. His eyes went wide and he looked away for a second. Then I looked down at his legs and his feet were really nice. I stood back up to give him and him a better look. But I didn't give him any of the attention or I would have lost my confidence.</p> <p>As I was thinking that, the door to the back of the store opened and in walked my son. He was standing in front of me in a skirt that fell to about mid thigh.
