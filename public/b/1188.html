Well, we can talk tomorrow while the food and drinks are getting ready in the meantime.'</p> <p>I smiled at that last bit of information.</p> <p>'Good.'</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>After the meal and the drinks, I took in what I could of the sights. The grounds, the art galleries, even the swimming pools were all great, and even the shops were crowded with displays of every kind imaginable. After a while, I decided I needed a drink as I didn't want to be sweltering with the night air all over me, and then decided to get a glass of wine from one of the stalls while I waited for the drinks.</p> <p>As I sipped my wine I noticed that there was a small crowd of women in the lobby, and when I walked behind a curtain separating the stalls from the lobby, I noticed that the woman that I had first noticed was standing by a table, having made the reservation. It was just the two of us.</p> <p>After the wine had flowed I took my empty glass and stood there. I think it was just as well that the lady with the small glass had taken her eyes off me and not looked at me before. I took a quick sip of my wine and then asked, "So, what do you do for fun, then?"</p> <p>"I'm pretty good," the lady answered. "I'm just getting to know guys. Well, like I do with guys; I find them attractive too."</p> <p>Her reply startled me, but after a moment I just smiled at her.</p> <p>"What was that all about?" I asked her.</p> <p>"I wanted to know what you liked about me," she replied. "Besides, you're only going to get your one night stands tonight!"</p> <p>We laughed. She and I had always been more sexual than boyfriend and girlfriend and sometimes we had even started to experiment just to get into bed.</p> <p>After a few more minutes of laughing about the little adventure we had shared, her companion came down and asked if she could use the bathroom, and as I watched her walk away she turned back toward me with that same smile, so much it looked like it never left her lips, and said, "Of course."</p> <p>With that my companion came forward and reached for me, pulling me toward the center of the small bathroom, then turned on the light, and just stood there staring at me with her mouth slightly open. She was wearing black stockings that stopped just below her knees, but had a slight sheen just enough to make them stand out against her legs. The sheer fabric was just the right amount to reveal her shapely legs, highlighted by the black straps of her sheer bra.</p> <p>I could feel my penis get harder. She smiled at the effect her stocking were having on me. "I hope I'm not too much older than you!" she said, with a smile that didn't leave a trace of humor on her face, though her voice somehow seemed to bring that same warmth with a trace of innocence, and her eyes.</p> <p>"No, no I'm quite the good looking dude," I said, reaching out and taking her in my arms, kissing her deeply on the mouth. There was no way I could say no without sounding like my penis was as big as it is when I have got the courage to speak. This time she did, but she broke away from me after a moment, leaving me with a smile on her face, while she slipped out of the bathroom and walked toward the small bathroom where I had been staying.</p> <p>In the next restroom I had had more wine, but at this point I was feeling a little tipsy. I made my way back to the bar and decided to have another drink, leaving a lot more for the ladies that were available. The night had just started and I was pretty tired. I went back and asked why. The bartender pointed out the restroom. I ordered another glass of wine and another for myself, and sat with a glass of wine for myself while I waited.</p> <p>About half an hour went by, when I heard the women walking down the hall. As my eyes adjusted to the dark I could make out they walked toward the restroom together, and when they got to the end of the hallway I heard them both say, "I guess the food is ready."</p> <p>After that they came back into the bar and walked into the bathroom together. I figured they were going to get rid of their bra, but they did not. My heart was beating faster. I decided to wait a few more minutes and see how long it took them. What if they told their lovers about the bathroom door and it would not work? I wanted to see if they were going toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
