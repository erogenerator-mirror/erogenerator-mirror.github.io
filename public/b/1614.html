We kissed warmly, his tongue exploring my mouth and his hands sliding down my backside and up under my dress.</p> <p>I broke our embrace, gasping for breath as my head fell back onto the tree. His hand traced softly along my legs, my skirt slid back and forth over my thighs. He had slipped off my panties and it felt deliciously wicked. His touch sent electrifying pulses up my spine, sending goose bumps across my body.</p> <p>"I've never done this before," he said, his fingers sliding along my slit. "Do you?"</p> <p>"Never touched another woman in my wildest, most forbidden dreams," I mumbled, my head lolling to one side. My skirt was bunched around my waist, my thighs parted, and he held my pussy open with one hand while he slipped a finger inside me.</p> <p>"You're tight," he smiled, his mouth nuzzling my neck. His finger was slick with my wetness. "Does it hurt?" he asked. I shook my head side to side. His finger moved deeper inside me, deeper than before, and his warm breath teased my skin.</p> <p>"It does at first," I whispered. "He did this to you as soon as we got here," I explained. "It hurt," I added with a giggle.</p> <p>He chuckled. He put his finger to his lips. "No, this time it will be even worse," he said. He kissed my inner thigh as he slipped a second finger inside me.</p> <p>"Ooh...," I moaned. "Oh...," I cried, "O...O," my head twisting from side to side as his fingers stroked my insides. He pushed them in and out, moving them around inside my vagina, then withdrew them again, his wet tongue sliding out and up to moisten my lips. I gasped at the exquisite contact.</p> <p>"This time," he said gently, "I'll fuck you." He lifted my panties off and threw them over his shoulder, then dropped them to the ground and took both my legs into his hands as he moved forward to sit on my thigh.</p> <p>He placed his cock at my pussy lips, his cock head sliding back and forth through my wetness, circling and parting the lips of my pussy. He was watching the expression on my face, his eyes following his cock as he pressed forward, filling me until my thighs were pressed together. He pulled back and looked me in the eye as he thrust his cock into me.</p> <p>"Oh god, yes, that feels amazing," I breathed. He was inside me, completely, and I felt his throbbing cock sliding into me. I closed my eyes and leaned back against the tree.</p> <p>"Just like this," he whispered into my ear, his breath hot against it, his lips moving closer to it. My neck flushed bright red with passion as he took my chin between his thumb and forefinger and gently tugged my hair. I opened my eyes slowly, my heart beating fast in my chest. He kissed me, slow and lingering.</p> <p>"I'm going to fuck you like this," he said simply. He slid a hand behind my neck and brought his mouth down to mine, his tongue probing and prodding against my lips. He slipped another finger inside me, then another, and I moaned into his mouth.</p> <p>"Please," was all I could get out in a whisper. His cock was pulsing inside me, throbbing, deep, stretching. There was no finesse, no teasing, just a demanding burning desire to be pounded and filled as he was pumping me in and out. I held him close, wrapping my legs around him and pulling me close as he moved his hips forward to impale me on his cock. The head of his cock rested against the entrance to my womb and he reached his hand inside to finger my clit as he fucked me.</p> <p>"Harder," I breathed. "Fuck me harder," I urged. "I'm close."</p> <p>"I want to hurt you," he whispered against my mouth as he rocked my body. His lips crushed mine as his fingers began to move faster inside me. "I'm going to fuck you like this, if you want me to," he hissed into my ear. "I've always wanted to... " I gasped, my chest heaving as my orgasm approached. He kissed the top of my shoulder, his teeth nibbling against my nipple as he fucked me harder. I put my hands in the back of his hair, my eyes closed, loving the feel of him inside me as his fingers danced inside me. I closed my eyes, lost in the sensation. He kissed me, his tongue dancing with mine in one long lingering kiss.
