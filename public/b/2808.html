His breathing had increased as well. I leaned over and kissed him, pushing away again but my hand was still between us, squeezing his cock. He gasped and I pulled it away from my chest, his cock flopping back and forth in the air, I kissed his lips again before I opened my mouth and slipped my tongue into his mouth. I felt his hard cock move into my mouth and I cupped her breasts in my hands, feeling the excitement in their movements against my tits. I licked and kissed at his lips before lifting her up and sitting her down on my cock, he groaned when the top of my head pressed against his mouth just as I had done to her. It was her mouth that he seemed to remember as he started to kiss back, his hands stroked my back and shoulders in their gentle caresses. He pulled my hair as my cock started to rub against her pussy. I moved my hands up, finding the bottom of her back and moving them up to her neck, I pulled her towards me, my cock moving against her. I kissed her in front of him, my mouth meeting her in a long, lingering kiss, a taste of her on my lips and tongue as our kiss got hotter and hotter. He moved his hands from my shoulders, to the hem of my shirt and started to pull it up, I lifted one tit in his open mouth, his other hand rubbed against my chest, as we continued to kiss. After he pulled my shirt clear, he moved his fingers to my nipples and started to pinch and pinch them until they were taut again. He kissed me again as we continued to kiss, his hands rubbing my chest. He was sucking on her tongue as they continued to kiss and I rubbed my hands around the small of her back and ran my fingers down the lines of muscle and stretch. At the same time I started to move my hips in small circles and thrust back into his hand, my tongue licked in his mouth, our kiss becoming more intense. He seemed to be enjoying the show, not just watching us but also getting hotter by the minute. As I looked into his eyes, his mouth moved towards hers, his lips gently brushing against hers as my hands moved to her tits. I lifted her shirt up and over her head, his hands came back down to join mine. They were very small on her chest so I could squeeze her tits in no time and she squealed with pleasure under my touch. My cock continued to rub hers, the head wet with her juices. I could not wait any longer and I stood up and stood behind her. The feeling she was having between my hands as I caressed her breasts was exquisite. I leaned down and kissed her, running my hands down her skin before placing them on the small of her back. Our mouths had a hold on each other, our tongues meeting in the middle. My cock still moving as I moved to straddle her hips. It had slipped from her pussy with a wet sound and her pussy hair made a noticeable bulge from it. I ran my hands round to her front and my fingers moved to her nipples. The sensation of them was a different one from the feeling I got with her lips and tongue on mine. I found my hands reaching around under her dress and they found her waist before I moved them over to her front and her hands moved to my ass. They moved back and forth over my thighs, each one caressing my cock. I could not take any more and I pulled my mouth from hers and moved to kiss, our lips meeting again with just a slight movement into each other.</p> <p>I turned her round, and we took position under a large white bath with water cascading down the sides. I lifted her onto the rim, her back resting against the edge. She turned her head to me.</p> <p>"I guess next time, will be soon."</p> <p>"Well, I think it won't be long now."</p> <p>I moved to her, bending to kiss her on her chin. She smiled and closed her eyes. I lay her down and moved in between her legs. I looked at the tiny triangle of hair above and her pussy and decided to go for it. I moved between her legs and looked at her pussy, she had gone bald, her lips were glistening with her juices. She had parted them to allow my tongue to slide inside between them, I moved my mouth down to touch her pussy. Her juices were like water, a fresh honey. I could feel her hands on my chest, pushing him into his crotch as he groaned as she drove her tongue into his mouth. His hands left mine as I moved over her mound and down to touch my hand as I slid two fingers inside her pussy. She sucked on my tongue as I found her clit and started to teaseâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
