"You know, it's a very interesting car."</p> <p>"Oh I do, it's a very interesting car," she confirmed.</p> <p>I looked at the driver's license. "Wow, that looks like one of those fancy cars," I said, smiling.</p> <p>"Oh I don't know about fancy cars; I guess its just an old car from when I was in my thirties, something I can't afford."</p> <p>I had to laugh. "I've seen a lot of them," I said.</p> <p>"Oh yes, a lot," she said.</p> <p>I noticed a few cars were parked on the street. That made my wife laugh. And, it made me laugh. I had to control what I said. I decided to play around a little bit.</p> <p>"Where is your husband?" She inquired.</p> <p>"I went on a business trip, he's a businessman I guess. I was on the way home so I thought I'd stop." I smiled.</p> <p>"Well, I've heard some stories about your visit. Are you married, do you really enjoy driving as well?" She asked me.</p> <p>I thought for a moment. "Not really, no."</p> <p>"You're a very nice man Mr. Martin. I'd like to see you again."</p> <p>I had a sudden thought. "Do you really want to see me again?"</p> <p>She looked at me, as if to judge my answer. She seemed to be taking the first step in the direction I wanted. She seemed to be thinking about it for a few seconds.</p> <p>"Well, I'd like to, I really like what you have to make it happen." She said.</p> <p>"Well," I said, "I just can't see myself driving again. I'm not one of the big truck drivers, you know."</p> <p>She was thinking of an answer. "That's nice," she said. "I can only assume you enjoy driving."</p> <p>"Yes, it's nice."</p> <p>"You do enjoy driving, don't you?" she said.</p> <p>I smiled. "Yeah, I do."</p> <p>"Can you tell me about yourself?" She asked.</p> <p>"Yes, of course I can, I really like to drive." With that reply she turned and leaned on me, her arm around my waist.</p> <p>"You could say that." She stated. "Come on, I'll show you where my office is." I opened the door, she took my hand and led me in to her office. I felt like I would fall off as she closed the door.</p> <p>"Oh this is nice." She said as she led me into the office. "Would you like something to drink?" she asked. "We have a cold iced tea?" She asked. I had no idea what she was getting at, but I was not going to let her off easy. "I'll take this, it's really cold."</p> <p>"No, not ice. You won't be able to stop the snow. Here, drink this." I handed her the tea, I really thought I might be out of my mind with this.</p> <p>"Now we're getting somewhere. I can see there is no ice. You would like to get some, I know it would be nice." She said.</p> <p>"Yes, I'm really excited to get ice." I replied.</p> <p>"Me too. Your coffee is cold."</p> <p>"Okay, I don't normally drink coffee, but I'm not going to drink it now. Let's get started then."</p> <p>"There we are," she said, "I guess I won't be staying for too long."</p> <p>I watched her. She could have gone and had an early start. But, she had an advantage. She had her jacket off, and was showing quite a bit of cleavage as she leaned on me. Even though she was just forty-four years old, I was seeing that she had aged and was really, really sexy in her professional sense. She really did look like she would pass for forty years old. Her jacket was open, and some cleavage showed when she leaned back, her cleavage looked like it might spill out of the sleeves. The jacket was open just two buttons above the upper portion of a blouse. This left her blouse just above the waistline of her skirt. Her skirt was about mid-thigh. It was dark blue, like the top two buttons of her blouse. It was low cut and could easily be pulled off without making an effort to cover up. Her legs were crossed in front, almost as if she was showing off the skirt. And, her feet wereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
