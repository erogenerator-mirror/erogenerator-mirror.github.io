Her hand was on mine as we began to slowly kiss. When our tongues became close I cupped her breast in my hands and gently squeezed it. It felt wonderful. My hand moved in small circles over the erect nipple. Her mouth continued to suck on mine and I gently nibbled on the lips of her pussy. After a while of touching each other our bodies began to become hot and sweaty. She began to caress my balls and gently tugged my cock. After a while we stopped kissing. I moved round to the other side and began to un-zip her dress while still sucking on the nipple. She helped me get the dress off. It fell to the floor. It was now I who wanted to see her naked. I gently unclasped her bra and removed it. Her breasts stood proud and firm with large pink nipples. I leaned over and began to suck in her right breast, the nipple was thick and hard. At the same time I slid my hand down to her pussy. She spread her legs and I could feel her wet lips were swollen. My fingers slipped easily into her.</p> <p>I rubbed and massaged her clit with a slow cadence which seemed to turn her on more and more.</p> <p>“You like it like that don’t you?”</p> <p>“Yes, yes, yes.”</p> <p>That seemed to excite her even more. She was now moving so very sensuously that I could do virtually anything to her. I continued to stroke her clit, sliding in and out of her pussy. I was now in the zone as her moans and cries got louder and more passionate. She pulled at my cock, trying to get me inside her. I withdrew from her to let just the tip slide out of her. Then I slowly entered her again, until my pubes slapped hers together. She began to move backwards on the bed. As I began to fuck her, slowly at first then faster, she screamed and shouted my name. After about five minutes of love making I was ready to blow and told her to lay down on her side. I moved around until I was in front of her and lay on my side. I moved my hand up her thigh and caressed her clit with the tip of my finger on each stroke. This pushed her over the edge. She cried out and then squealed and orgasmed as she held onto my finger with her pussy. There were some minor hiccups of her body, but they didn’t cause any pain. We lay still for a long time and we just looked at each other. There were smiles in all three of our face. I got out of bed and went in and got a cloth to clean up the mess we had created. I returned with a pillow top pillow and covered my head. Before we could touch each other again all three of us were falling asleep. The next thing I knew we were naked on the bed, kissing, sucking and caressing each other’s bodies. I was stroking her breasts while she was sucking on mine. After all the foreplay I really got into the mood and it was then that we knew there was only one thing we wanted as our passions began to raise. We fucked like mad for several minutes and then began to feel that familiar feeling. We climaxed together again and then just lay panting with me trying to gather my thoughts so I could talk about this afternoon’s events without ruining the experience for either of us.</p> <p>It was almost an hour before the two of us got up to get shower. When we emerged from the bathroom she was still in the same position. We walked hand in hand, each of us looking a little wobbly after how long we had been walking and having the time of our lives. My friend, who had helped me pick out the suit, sat her down again and began to wash her too.</p> <p>“You are a lucky man. I feel for you both”</p> <p>“How did we do?”</p> <p>“It is still a learning process. But it sure is the most exciting thing we have ever done. I have not thought things could move this far that fast.”</p> <p>“Did it mean anything?”</p> <p>“No not at all. It was all about us. It was the thrill of the moment really. I know that you know that the most intense thing a woman can do is to ask her partner to make love to her. I think you both experienced it that way.”</p> <p>“I can’t remember the exact moment in the day when we had that experience so intense. We made love on a bed in a motel room. It happened in a hotel room and in a restaurant. Yes, it was exciting, but the best for us—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
