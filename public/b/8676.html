I was taken aback when she stood right in front of me and turned to reach my side. She did it slowly and seductively. I could tell from her hands how much she wanted it and desire on her face, her chest rising and falling like the wind on a warm night. I moved forward slowly, feeling my pulse racing. Just when I thought I was going to explode right there, she stepped back and started again.</p> <p>She slowly turned back to me, slowly putting a foot up my leg to rest her foot on my thigh. When she bent her foot, leaving her knee and leg in contact with the front of my thigh I felt my heart stop. I was completely taken aback. I had known this woman before, of all of us but when I went to the bar and saw her standing in front of me naked, I knew. Suddenly, I wanted her even more than I'd wanted my wife since I'd watched her being humiliated. I stood up, my cock straining like it had never gone. She turned again to face me, still bent over my leg, her face hidden by her hair.</p> <p>"Let me," she said quietly. I hesitated for a second, waiting for her permission, then slowly reached out and slowly pulled her arm down to her side, exposing her tit. She let go of her hair, but not her arm. I reached out and slipped my hand under hers and cupped her tit again. I was mesmerized with how it felt. The softness of her skin. The softness of her breath.</p> <p>I slipped my hand up her arm and over her shoulder, my skin hot on her smooth skin. I slowly started to trace my fingertips up and down the side of her forearm, her arm starting to move slightly. I felt her tremble slightly and she moved her hips just slightly forward. I turned the other hand around and moved up to her other arm and gave her hand a gentle squeeze. After my first squeeze, she turned to face me. I couldn't get her to look at me as I reached down and put my hand over her mouth. It was a shock to my system as my mind reeled at how I couldn't resist.</p> <p>"You said something to me." My voice was barely audible. My hand was wet. My body shivered as I touched her, then I felt her shake as if she were afraid to move my hand. "Are you sure you want me to make this a threesome with you and him?" I was stunned at myself for daring to ask her. "Oh, that's okay", she whispered, "I'll make sure he comes." She kissed me, her mouth warm and full of passion. I leaned towards her as she slid one of her arms around my neck and her other hand ran down the side of my cheek until she touched my ear. I leaned forward and ran my tongue over her ear. She shivered again and I pulled back my lips and kissed her again. Her eyes were still closed as she tilted her head back. I knew she couldn't hold on to me so I pulled away from her and sat back down on the couch, my fingers still in her mouth. She leaned over me and kissed me again.</p> <p>"I want to make you come a lot today". She said this last one quietly. She pulled my hand out of her mouth and took my hand in her own. She put my hand back where mine had been, and she leaned towards me again. She kissed me again and her mouth had taken on an erotic, sensual, erotic shape as she opened her lips and her tongue touched my lips. As she slid her tongue into my mouth, our bodies were touching. Slowly it started to feel like a dream as she slowly slipped my head towards the side of the couch, her hand coming up on the top of my head as my ear brushed against her neck. I reached up and put my hands on her shoulders, running my hands over her bare skin, moving in little circular motions. Her tits were still heaving as our breathing became synchronized. She pushed me back slightly, my cock throbbing in my pants. "Come on, you're not even touching your hand. You're not even looking at me", she said softly. I reached down and unzipped my pants, my cock now throbbing and hard. She slid her hand under the elastic in the top of my pants and I lifted my ass, wanting to get that hand to explore me. I lifted my cock to her hand and kissed it, then slid my hand slowly over her breasts, caressing her hard nipples. My fingers flicked her pussy, and she moaned as she pulled my free hand across her shoulder. I turned us around so I could put her back on the couch, her leg over mine as she lay there, her hand still under mine. She had put her legs over mineâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
