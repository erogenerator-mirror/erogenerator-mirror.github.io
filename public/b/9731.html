"So beautiful to be here. When he saw you the first time, he said he would pay to see it in some color, which we found out he doesn't care for, so if it were still beautiful, he would do it."</p> <p>"What color? How will I look when he pays?" I asked.</p> <p>He didn't answer. He leaned forward and kissed her on the mouth. He kissed her lips with a passion she had never felt before and she responded with a hunger of her own. He pushed his tongue inside her mouth, exploring it as if he had never tasted anything so sweet or arousing. She was as horny as I was, and I felt like we would both fuck us both tonight. She pulled away slightly to kiss him again at the corner of his mouth.</p> <p>"Now what?" she asked.</p> <p>"Now, we get to the bedroom," he replied. "Before we do anything else, I want to give you a kiss goodnight."</p> <p>He ran the tip of his tongue up and down her lip lightly and she leaned backward, pushing her hips backwards.</p> <p>"What do you think you're doing?" she laughed as she kicked off her sandals. The sun's light was beginning to make its warm caress from the pool's roof.</p> <p>"I was just playing with my pussy."</p> <p>"I didn't mean anything by it," she said as she undid her shorts.</p> <p>She let them fall to the rocks and stepped out of them. She leaned forward to kiss his neck, which was so sexy it made me want to strip out of my pants right there. He stepped forward to kiss her again and she held onto his shoulders to keep herself out of the water. He kissed her breasts through the fabric and she moaned. I could hear the squish as he reached around with one hand and undid some of the buttons to her blouse. She pushed her chest forward against his head and looked up at him, smiling. She raised a leg over his own, spreading herself open for him to play. I walked across with my own clothes as quickly as I could.</p> <p>"You're right," I said as I picked up Jenny's shorts and slipped them and Jenny's panties back on. "That was a good sign."</p> <p>"I wish I could be here with you all the time," she smiled.</p> <p>She lifted up and leaned back as he turned her so that her back and hips were against the side of the pool. She put her legs on his chest, her knees bent, and her hands holding onto his shoulders. She had a look of rapture on her face.</p> <p>We were quiet as he pulled her into the shallow end of the pool, her back, her chest, her lips, the top of her head, her breasts, and her legs. I kissed her lips again and she parted her mouth, her tongue pushing along mine for I know, one for my own.</p> <p>"Do you still want to cum? You know it's time to stop talking and just fuck me, don't you? Do you like to watch me?"</p> <p>She pulled herself on top of him, his hand still caressing her back. She looked down at his lips on her neck and he nodded slowly. They kissed once more as he pressed them harder and she pushed backwards, impaling herself, moving up and down on his cock until he was nearly inside her, and held himself there until she slowly stopped moving off of him.</p> <p>She turned her head and kissed me. "We're going to make you beg for it," she said as she moved away.</p> <p>She stepped forward and pulled me from the swim side of the pool and we embraced in the pool for a minute or so. The water was cooler from the heat and we laughed as we got out.</p> <p>"You're going to make me come to my senses for two seconds," she laughed.</p> <p>"Me too," I smiled.</p> <p>We walked quickly to the house and he put my clothes into the bathroom without asking if I'd let him. He took off his clothes as I had and we climbed into the bed and lay there. Her thighs had spread wide for him as he got ready. I lay on my back and slid my right leg across his left. He had put her head on my stomach as we lay in the warm water. I felt him slide her wet skin under my leg. I held both her arms to keep mine open for his pleasure. She turned them sideways as I took the cue and put it to her.</p> <p>She sat up and leaned toward him and he slid up behind her, her back to mine as he held her. We slowly kissed and I felt his erection push against myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
