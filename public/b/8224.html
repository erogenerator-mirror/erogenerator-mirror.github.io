She turned toward him and leaned back. With a soft "Oh," she closed her eyes as he kissed her forehead, her face and her neck. As her arms tightened their grip around him she smiled and tilted her head up toward his again.</p> <p>He ran his hands down the back of her body and began to unhook each of the straps holding up her dress. She could feel his cock get harder as he pulled the straps off, and her body felt the cool air tease her and make her nipples tighten. Her body stiffened at the thought of his fingers brushing over them. He reached behind her and felt the bottom of his cock, and then brought his lips to her shoulder. She shivered and let out a little moan as she heard his hand rub over her pussy. His fingers danced across her lips as he rubbed her, and she felt her hips begin to push up against his touch as she gasped and spread her legs a little wider. He ran a hand from the back of her neck down over her spine, and pulled the dress up around her waist so she was completely exposed. Her ass felt like it was on fire with the fabric of the dress and the skin tight fabric. The feeling of his fingers moving on her pussy excited her with each movement. She wanted to be touched, wanted him to touch her, wanted him to make her come!</p> <p>He stepped away from her, and with a mischievous grin, she watched him walk across the room towards what she imagined was an easy and private table. With her feet still on the platform and her heels still on the floor she sat up on the soft surface of one of the tables as she waited for him. As he walked across the room, her eyes followed his curves.</p> <p>As he approached the table she sat up on it and felt the warmth of the fireplace. Standing behind her she looked over her shoulder at the table, and saw him reach down and undo the snap of her bikini top.</p> <p>"Oh! That's easier!" she laughed, as she reached for the top and began to untie it. She could smell his cologne, and felt it wash over her.</p> <p>"You know, I'm a little surprised," she said as she continued to tug on the top.</p> <p>"Is it really necessary, or would you like to take a break?" He asked as he pulled her to him. His hands stroked her breasts and pinched her nipples.</p> <p>"Oh, if it's necessary. I would love to go back to the table, but no. I'd go back to my book if I could read my lips!" Her eyes met his. "You have a very talented mouth!" She smiled. "Thank you!" she said as she slowly undid the knot of her bikini bottom. Without wasting any more time she reached down and pulled the bikini over her head. She felt his fingers stroke her nipples again, and he bent to give them a little sucking. She let out a moan, and felt his cock twitch at how horny she was making him.</p> <p>"I'm gonna be in the mood for something else, now," he said as he stood up, and began to walk around the table. She giggled and said, "Wow, that feels so, nice!" as she continued to caress her hard nipples.</p> <p>As he made his way around the table she continued to caress her hard nipples, and then leaned down to run a hand over his stomach and legs. As he approached her slowly he leaned his head down, and then gently kissed her neck and her shoulders.</p> <p>"I'll need to see your legs, first," she said, and reached up her arms and around his ass. "You don't have to do that if it makes me uncomfortable," she said as she caressed his cheek and neck. "No, I want to be able to look at you," she said as she held his cock in her hand and moved up closer to him.</p> <p>"We don't need to do that," he said with a smile. "I'm just having some fun. We're alone in here, and that's what we were there for!"</p> <p>"That's very sound of you!" she moaned at how he was talking to her, and how he knew exactly what he wanted.</p> <p>It was her first time touching him, and she felt a small thrill run through her at the thought of him touching her. He bent his mouth to her ear and whispered, "Do you like to be touched and kissed, by another man?"</p> <p>"I wouldn't mind any of the other men touching me at all!" she said as she pulled her hands back along his thighs, and reached back to grab his cock. "Why don't you touch me justâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
