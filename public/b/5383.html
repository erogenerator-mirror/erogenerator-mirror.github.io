She got up and put on her best outfit, which consisted of a thin, short dress that left just enough of her cleavage to make the wearer see. Soph couldn't help but look for her friend's face.</p> <p>"So," she asked, as she walked over to John, "does that mean you're going to have a good time?"</p> <p>"Yeah, my girlfriend here wants to go to the party," explained John, "and we aren't going to miss anything."</p> <p>"It's fun," added Sophia, "but I think I'll like this one a little more."</p> <p>Heather was feeling very sexy tonight. Her dress hugged her body so tightly that there were very little to see in it. She was wearing a short beige skirt that was split up the front with a thin band. It went well up to the very bottom of her ass but didn't quite reach the top. She wore a pale yellow silk top that had thin spaghetti straps on both sides and barely covered her tits. The dress was cut so high it was transparent. She wore a white blouse with a scoop neck and it looked even better out that way. The top didn't have a lot of buttons so it looked like she was wearing a long necked blouse. At the front the top barely reached her crotch. The top was so short that it barely covered her cleavage and came only a couple of inches above the bottom of her ass. The top was so thin that it just barely held onto her tits in the front and not much below. Her tits were so large that it was impossible to wear a bra.</p> <p>John and Sophia both stared openly while he went through his list, leaving Heather and Soph alone. After looking at John's list she went ahead with the list. "How much is it supposed to take?" asked Sophia. "I'm not going to be able to go to the next party."</p> <p>"It takes five hours to get to the last event, three hours of partying," replied John. "You have to sleep in a different bed every night."</p> <p>Everyone knew he was right. Heather and Soph agreed together but they had to get up before they could get to the event. The day after graduation Heather and Soph took a vacation to an island in the Caribbean. The next two days went smoothly but they weren't all that happy. Heather was the first one to arrive. She would wake up in the morning and go to her room to change for the party. John was the next one out of bed to go to the party the second day. He couldn't even wait until the party to get out of bed to get ready. By the time Heather arrived the next night, she was ready for the party.</p> <p>John was nervous. He had a feeling that Sophia and Heather wouldn't even get to the party. He was too nervous to go.</p> <p>After the first hour, John's stomach was doing the talking when Sophia and Heather came back around one in the afternoon, wearing a light blue summer dress. They were both dressed up in very tiny pink bikini panties and matching bra. John could hear something that sounded like heels clicking on the tile floor and something hard. John could sense that something was in the air.</p> <p>Sophia looked over at him and said, "I didn't think you were ready to get to the party yet."</p> <p>"I just came up to get some juice," John said. "I was feeling better after you left."</p> <p>"Me too," said Sophia, "or you're going to be sick."</p> <p>"Yeah, I know," said John. "I'm just going to go grab some juice."</p> <p>"Don't get into the fridge," said Sophia. "If you get lucky, you can pick that hard thing up."</p> <p>Sophia took John by the elbow and started walking into the living room. She had a look of nervousness on her face and John was beginning to relax. Sophia had just put on a couple of glasses of juice and was standing at John's room door taking a sip. She couldn't have looked anything more gorgeous. John couldn't help but feel that he was falling in love with Sophia.</p> <p>When they reached John, Sophia put her glass down on a dining table. John's eyes were wide.</p> <p>"That's the hard thing," said Sophia. "It's like I'm in your shoes and you don't seem to feel in control."</p> <p>Sophia leaned in closer to John and placed her hands on his chest. Her hands reached down and she began to kneed his nipples through his shirt. John started to get excited. Sophia got up a little and stood in front of John and took her sweater off, tossing it to one side. She took her panties off and started to step back out of her pants.</p> <p>John was speechless.
