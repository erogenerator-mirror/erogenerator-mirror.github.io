The birds were singing and the scent of the roses was filling the room, the breeze was blowing over the window and the room was so warm and inviting.</p> <p>My heart was racing and my breath quicken and I was trembling a little but I kept saying "Thank you" over and over as I walked, my thighs were wet, my panties were dripping and my clitty was hard as a rock and as I approached the door I started to shiver.</p> <p>I had my first "pussy massage" at a swingers club, and that was only a few weeks ago.</p> <p>When I opened the door and stood there, all I could think of was my new friend and then I thought of what I had to say!</p> <p>I turned back to the doorway, I was still trembling but I turned back the door and closed it quickly then went back upstairs.</p> <p>When I woke Sunday morning, my bed didn't smell of my perfume, I was out, my back was wet.</p> <p>I had slept so well that night that I was really excited by the thought of what I had to say as I got ready for work.</p> <p>As I was leaving work, I ran into my old friend in the department store she had gone to last week when she came home from the coast, who was a little bummed out by her "no sex" rule.</p> <p>We had been talking and when I told her what we had talked about and she thought this was a good idea, she asked, "Well if you were going to keep that "pussy" rule of 'keep it down,' then we need to have a talk. "Pussy, pussy, you can't use the word pussy," you need to use the name."</p> <p>I looked at her like she was nuts, but what the hell, I had heard that word often enough over the years and it had just never stuck.</p> <p>So, I asked her, what now?"</p> <p>"Fuck," she replied, "Fuck me."</p> <p>Well that wasn't a problem, as she had always liked and wanted me to please her, I guess she really wanted me to give it.</p> <p>"I've been having such a good time, it was all the sex talk I needed to pass the week."</p> <p>She nodded and told me she just needed a break for an hour or two.</p> <p>We went to our usual coffee shop and had a couple of coffee and snacks together at one point.</p> <p>It was then I remembered that the "Pussy" rule had to be changed the previous week. I thought it was the first time I would remember the "pussy rule" but now it seemed like that had hit home for me.</p> <p>The first part of me got a feeling that it would be fun.</p> <p>I thought it would be fun too, I started working on making my decision in less than a week.</p> <p>It was a tough week with a couple of things.</p> <p>One day in the park, I parked a bench on the edge of a big hill in the middle of the park; there didn't seem to be so many cars in the park.</p> <p>I had just made a mental note to buy a big double ended one when I saw her coming down the park, so I turned around and had a better view of her. It didn't take long for my dick to start getting hard and as it did so, I could see it starting to poke through the zipper of my shorts, I didn't even care that a nice young girl was walking by, she looked at me and I just gave her a look like, Fuck, I want to do that again, then the sun rises, so the thought crossed my mind as I walked by her.</p> <p>As I crossed to her a girl was walking by, but she came up to me and asked if I was okay, "I was just thinking about you."</p> <p>I smiled back at her, "Yea, I think you looked fine" so we just looked at each other and then I realized she was smiling at me.</p> <p>So after she said, "You sure are good looking, are you sure you want to go out like that? "I didn't want to, "you are too young" I would never fuck my girlfriend, or get married, I wanted someone that wanted me.</p> <p>I had no illusions, she was just a sweet young thing that had wanted to experience some sex, to have some young man in her life, that didn't mean she wanted me.</p> <p>I started to tell her that it didn't matter.</p> <p>Instead, I just got out a bunch of my "no sexâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
