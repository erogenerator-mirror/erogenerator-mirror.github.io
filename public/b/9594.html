I can't do it."</p> <p>"You can just let him fuck your ass. He's not my type." I said.</p> <p>He laughed. "That's the whole point of the thing to get that virgin ass. He's gonna get you to take it."</p> <p>I was shocked; my ass was no longer virgin like it had been at eighteen. It had gotten that way many times before with my Dad. Mom, Dad, and even his older brothers and I were at one of the family gatherings and all the girls had been there.</p> <p>She had said it often enough that I knew that she didn't like it but it had always happened. She hadn't been doing it to me; it had always meant her giving me a present. It had always done something to me and now it was something I knew would come later when I let her go and go out on her own.</p> <p>"Do you really want to do this?" I asked. "Do you want someone else?"</p> <p>"Do you really want to do it?" He repeated as if to confirm it.</p> <p>I nodded excitedly.</p> <p>"Good. I'll be there as soon as you are ready. We'll find someplace else I can make you feel good."</p> <p>"You can stay here and play with my ass for a while, okay?" I asked.</p> <p>He chuckled.</p> <p>"Come on, it won't hurt at all." He said. "You don't have to do anything else at all that you don't want to."</p> <p>I had my jeans unbuckled and was pulling off my shirt but had my shirt on. When I got to his door I went to get a pair of shorts. He'd asked me to put on a shirt and since I was still wearing my sneakers and shorts I didn't bring any in which seemed a little strange.</p> <p>"No, that's fine." He stepped out into the hallway. "But if you want to get into the shower first we'll find something else."</p> <p>I hurriedly pulled my shirt off, took my jeans off and ran to the shower where I turned it on to warm it up before stepping under the shower. I knew what was coming. He had said it to me earlier when he and Mom were both out of town because she thought she still needed to be out in the kitchen looking at dishes.</p> <p>It hit me just how much I was turned on by the thought of having him do it with me.</p> <p>"Are you alright with this?" I asked.</p> <p>He hadn't moved. "I'm fine, it'll be my pleasure." He said as he stepped into the shower. "Do you want me to take off my shirt?"</p> <p>I nodded and he did it right away.</p> <p>When his face was inches outside the shower door I pulled his face towards me and kissed him with a passionate passion. If it was ever anything like that I would have taken it. I was surprised at how turned on I was by the idea of having this man's hands all over me and myself, or his own mouth on mine.</p> <p>"Go ahead, it's your turn." I whispered in his ear.</p> <p>He had a towel wrapped around his waist. When he turned around to let me in a surprised look caught me totally off guard. The fact that his eyes had returned to my eyes that whole day wasn't even in my description of him. I was in awe of something I'd never even dreamed about. His eyes were beautiful and had something to do with the amount of energy in them but his body was so completely and utterly masculine it made me dizzy.</p> <p>"You can do anything you want." I whispered as I took the shower head and rinsed myself off as quickly as I could before taking my towel off myself and standing there naked. He was standing at the doorway and I stepped close in front of him until our heads touched.</p> <p>I felt those two hands on my body. I felt the soft washcloth of his hands working over me. I felt his lips brushing the side of my cheek. I sighed and felt his body press against me. My head dipped down and our lips connected. The kiss lasted what felt like forever and as it ended I found myself pressing forward a little more. His hands took the hand that held my towel off the wall and began to stroke me until it was wet and then I felt his fingers slide over the lips of my vagina. I felt the warmth of it sliding slowly in and out. I felt his tongue licking my breasts and the nipples and then his tongue was sliding and pressing down my tummy and then it was back coming to the opening of my vagina and sliding in.</p> <p>I pulled him close. I felt his body against me, but I was afraid of the feelings that were rushing through me. I wanted more and pulled him back away from me towardsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
