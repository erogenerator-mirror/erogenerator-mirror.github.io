I can see it in you, I can see it in you. Is that why you're all mine?"</p> <p>I nodded again.</p> <p>"I don't want to hurt you. I really don't."</p> <p>"That's very kind, but I really like it when you are rough with me. I'm just a beginner."</p> <p>I could feel that I couldn't stop myself taking her. I was hers. And she wanted to own me.</p> <p>"And I like you, too, right? That's all I want you to know. I want to be yours." Her words were almost as true as my own, but I wondered if she was also really telling me I was her.</p> <p>She seemed to sense that something wasn't quite right. She pulled away from me and pulled up her panties. I was stunned, but excited, at the same time. She slid onto the bed on top of me and kissed me.</p> <p>"I'm going to enjoy teaching you the same things you are learning. Just let your head hang back and let it happen, baby." She was smiling now, and there was a look on her face that changed to what I realized it had. I was in her bed, on her bed. I was doing things that she had never even suggested I do.</p> <p>But with the newness of the newness, it was still a little strange, having done these things that had her so close to me.</p> <p>I pulled her to me and kissed her.</p> <p>"I've wanted that for years."</p> <p>She looked at me, a little scared. "I've never been with a woman before so I guess I'm a little scared."</p> <p>"I promise you, I never will be a woman or a man. I'd love to be a woman." I held her to me and kissed her again.</p> <p>"I think we can make this just be an experience for both of us." she looked down at me, at my naked body. "I'd do anything for the first time, if you've got a mind to. It's so sexy to know that you don't have to ask me to do anything you don't want me to do."</p> <p>Suddenly, she was naked too, and lying next to me. Without a word, I lay there as she began to suck my nipples, while running her hands over my body.</p> <p>"It's hard to resist you any more, baby. It's very hard."</p> <p>Her hands began to massage my body as she kissed me and then moved lower to my pussy. I wanted to tell her to stop, to take it slow. I hadn't meant it that way. I really, really, really wanted to feel her touch me. I'd never had any one touch me like this. "It's like your fingers. They have such a nice feel."</p> <p>"They're like your big cock, isn't it baby?"</p> <p>I couldn't answer because she would have to come up onto her elbows and be facing me. She kissed me again, this time, and began to finger me as her own mouth covered my breasts. I felt something go down between my legs, and a finger slid around my hole, then slid down to the opening and then inside me. My first experience of penetration was with my own fingers before.</p> <p>She seemed very, very gentle. She had to know that she liked to be on top, that she could be the one doing the taking. I wasn't being forced or made to be her, but it was nice that she wanted to be in control. For a second or two, I was thinking that maybe I wanted to be the one doing the taking, but I had a feeling that I couldn't be the one getting off in the middle of those words. And then I felt her climb up on me. Her head looked beautiful, and it looked so real, like someone had really done this before. Her breasts were hanging down towards me, and her eyes were looking right at me.</p> <p>Her legs pressed against both sides of mine and I felt like she was looking right at me, looking into me. In her face was a look so soft and honest, with her face and lips touching and then kissing. I wanted to think how I hated to be the one getting off or having my own orgasm. It felt good to be on top. I wanted to be her in control of everything. I wanted to be the one giving her pleasure, and I wanted to be her in control of everything.</p> <p>She was still on top. She didn't make meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
