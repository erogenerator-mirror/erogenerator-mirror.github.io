But if we're going to the club you're going to have to come first."</p> <p>"That'll be our only option, at least for the first evening. And if I refuse you a dance it's over before I lose interest."</p> <p>My heart was suddenly thumping in my chest like a jackknifed bass drum. It was as if she'd just come to a decision on a decision. I don't know why. But at that moment it was too late. I was going to have a great time with my new lover.</p> <p>"Come with me."</p> <p>I lead her downstairs to the second floor and a dimly lit door. It was a dim light with soft music.</p> <p>"Now we're even," I said.</p> <p>She followed me down a narrow hallway, past the bathroom, past the kitchen area. I opened the door and there was a beautiful bedroom decorated with a large bed with a satin canopy bedspread on the bed. I opened my door and took in her body in all its beauty. She was slender in the center, but curvy for her age. The only thing she didn't have on was that transparent silk robe which barely covers her ample breasts and it was obvious she was braless beneath.</p> <p>Her legs were long and shapely. Her taut stomach was taut and accentuated by a pair of large black high-heeled sandals. Her dark hair was gathered into a pony-tail which was secured in a loose knot with a single lock. The contrast of everything made her look even more irresistible.</p> <p>"Don't think I've not seen enough of you tonight, honey."</p> <p>"You're a great lover, Jack."</p> <p>"And sweetie, I've never met this woman before, but if it's what you want then..."</p> <p>"I want to be your lover, baby," she whispered in my ear. She'd put that down to a dreamy quality. She pulled me close, our lips met. We started kissing like a couple newlyweds. Her lips were soft and delicate. Her tongue gently caressed my lower lip. It was not a long kiss. But I held her close, our bodies entwined together. We kissed with intensity and my cock hardened uncomfortably in my shorts.</p> <p>"Mmm, honey," she moaned. "You just made me feel so good."</p> <p>"I've never felt that way with anyone before."</p> <p>She kissed me again, deeply, and her touch was electric. Our tongues intertwined, explored each other with care and desire. She broke the kiss to pull away from me and then she began unbuttoning my white shirt. When the top fell open my pecs were straining against my pecs for all it's worth. She pulled at the waistband of my shorts and helped get them down. I stepped out of them and she took some boxers with them and started at my ankles. She pulled them off and my cock sprung out, standing thick and erect in all its majestic glory.</p> <p>"That's a big cock," she said breathlessly, looking at it and licking her lips.</p> <p>"It's so thick too."</p> <p>"I think you've seen far bigger."</p> <p>She climbed onto the bed and pushed me back on the mattress. Her body was naked, the rest of her skin was silky and flawless, a tangle of golden strands down to her waist. In her hand was her most prized possession: a penis.</p> <p>She took that into her mouth and I could no longer control myself. She sucked me down her throat, deep and suctiony. All the while, the look on her face mirrored my face, my eyes, my mouth.</p> <p>"Ah, I've been waiting for just this, huh?"</p> <p>"For what, honey?"</p> <p>"For this," she cried, and her head bobbed up and down.</p> <p>I began to fuck her mouth, the speed and force increasing with each stroke. Her pace grew faster and faster. She was sucking the head like in her dream. The heat from her mouth was palpable and I knew I would not last much longer. Her eyes were sparkling as she sucked my cock.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah!" I screamed, and I erupted into her waiting mouth.</p> <p>Her lips and tongue were sucking me until I was completely spent.</p> <p>She pulled away after swallowing all that had spilled inside her mouth. My cock remained hard and erect. It must have glistened with her saliva.</p> <p>"Wow!" was her alluring responseâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
