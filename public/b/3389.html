Be nice. Oh, God, I'm cumming again!" she moaned out loud.</p> <p>"Fuck, you're big!" he moaned. "I can tell how much you've missed this. Go slow. We don't want to cum too fast so we don't hurt."</p> <p>It was a little scary to be using the word "hurting" as an adjective this way, but he wasn't about to give up anytime soon: not while she continued to suck. She did it again, and this time he felt her fingers sliding up and down him. He groaned aloud and thrust a little harder into her mouth.</p> <p>Suddenly, the gag pulled out with a sound. He pulled out of her mouth quickly, trying to steady himself so as not to hurt her. He ran his fingers along the side of her soft mouth and over her cheek. She smiled at him, then put her tongue out.</p> <p>"I want you back in my mouth," he told her.</p> <p>"Mmm, I love to suck you, Brad," she answered and got back to work.</p> <p>He had to hold his breath. It was a bit awkward to do it but she pulled it off again with a loud moan this time, and went back to sucking, stroking, sucking and running her tongue all over his cock. He kept on panting. He closed his eyes so he could imagine her lips sucking on him and it felt so good. He knew he wasn't going to last a long time when she took his cock back into her mouth.</p> <p>Then she sat up to look at him, and said, "Ohmigod. I've wanted to do 69 with you."</p> <p>"I think I like 69 with you, too," he said.</p> <p>"You're not too happy about this?" she asked.</p> <p>"I'm fine. I'll tell you in bed."</p> <p>She smiled and stood up. "I can't believe I still can move. It feels so fucking good."</p> <p>"It does," he said with a laugh. "I'll have to tell you what I want to say. But I'll have to leave it up to you. Besides which, you're giving me too much space right now."</p> <p>He put his hands on her back and pushed. At first she resisted but soon followed to get him to move a bit. He let go a little and she pushed against his chest with her ass. He pulled back some and put a finger in her pussy, making her groan. He licked his finger with his tongue and then stuck it in her ass. They started to work each other with their tongues.</p> <p>"That's good," she growled, as he fingered her cunt and finger fucked his ass.</p> <p>"I want more, Brad. I want some of your cock again."</p> <p>"Not in my mouth," he said sternly, pushing her back. She laughed and then he moved her off of him and knelt between her legs.</p> <p>"I can't reach your sweet cock, Brad," she said, reaching down again. "But I can give it to you."</p> <p>"No. I want to do it to you for real too."</p> <p>She smiled sweetly at him and said she would do anything he asked.</p> <p>He moved forward and put his cock at her pussy. She pushed against him, moving him in. He moved slowly, wanting the long, slow fuck which she was giving him. But finally he got tired and moved back, pushing into her.</p> <p>She said, "That's a little too much," then started to move a little in and out of him. "Oh yeah, fuck that's good. Fuck me, Brad. Fuck my cunt with your big cock again. That's better."</p> <p>"You're such a horny girl," he said. "I'm going to cum too soon when I fuck you."</p> <p>She groaned again and said "Wait, I want you in my ass."</p> <p>"Don't worry," he said. "It may take a little longer, too."</p> <p>Her body shuddered and tensed suddenly, and her body tensed. She let out a scream, followed by another and a third and before she was sure it was one of them, they came together into one hot, wet, orgasm, shooting cum into the air, one after the other.</p> <p>He moved away and told her to lay down. She moved onto her side, then he went with her. When they were both satisfied, she wrapped her arms round him. He kissed her tenderly on the lips.</p> <p>"My god, I'm so glad we did this. You did a good job."</p> <p>"You have no idea."</p> <p>-</p> <p>Brad, with his wife, was the last to leaveâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
