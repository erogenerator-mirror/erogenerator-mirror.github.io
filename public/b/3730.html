The boys rose and gathered their clothes. Alex made sure the water in the pool was still a bit cold so they would be more relaxed when they got out.</p> <p>The five men sat down in the tub as Alex and my pet came out. "I feel better knowing I have you."</p> <p>"Thank you, Sir," said my pet. "Your hand felt wonderful."</p> <p>"Thank you, Sir," said my pet.</p> <p>The boys cleaned themselves and then Alex and I helped the other boys shower. The boys had also washed their hair and had gotten the water going. Alex and I helped rinse off and join the others.</p> <p>When we were done we all took a quick shower and got dressed again. Alex and I helped the boys in a small room and they were then taken over to the door. I looked at them and smiled. This was one of the nicest, most comfortable, and the most special moments of my life. I thought for a moment about what a beautiful and amazing day it had been. "It was my greatest day ever." I thought. When we got out of the showers and gotten dressed and out of the shower, Alex and I went to our room. We stripped and then got into bed. I turned off the light and then kissed Alex and then me.</p> <p>"I love you, Sir." I said, gently pushing her back. "Sleep now." She replied.</p> <p>Alex then rolled on top of me and we both kissed. The kiss was warm, sensual, and full of purpose. I could sense the excitement in Alex as she kissed me. The passion that had been between us only moments before was building in this kiss. Our bodies ground together as the passion in the kiss intensified and we finally came together.</p> <p>Alex reached down and rubbed her clit against my leg as my legs spread. Her fingers entered me as another orgasm began to wash over me. I reached down and rubbed my clit as she pressed her finger harder into my pussy. I could feel my orgasm as her finger was entering me deeply.</p> <p>I reached down and touched my clit as she pressed her finger deeper while continuing to rub at me. I could feel the rush of my orgasm as it swept over me, spreading out through my entire body. "Mmm," I said. "Thank you, Sir."</p> <p>Alex smiled. "It's my pleasure."</p> <p>We lay there, cuddled together in the bed for a while, still holding each other, letting our bodies recover. I gently pushed Alex off me. She got off the bed and stood beside me, looking down at me. "Thank you, Sir." She said. Her hand reached to my face and stroked my cheeks and eyebrows.</p> <p>I turned over to look up at her. She wore a soft smile. "Thank you, Sir." She said, softly.</p> <p>It took all of the resolve in my heart to allow her to be mine while at the same time, still holding my face. I reached out and touched her face gently, tenderly. Her eyes were shining in the dim light of the room's room. It felt like a thousand light years. "I love you, Sir." She said as her hand closed around my wrist that her finger rested on my cheek. I smiled back and kissed her hand.</p> <p>She sat on the bed and we kissed for a while and she pulled me to her. Our kiss got softer as our desire ran though our minds. Alex had stopped playing with her own body earlier that day and now she needed to share her needs with me.</p> <p>"I need to lie down, Sir." She said, in a soft voice.</p> <p>I nodded and held her. I gently stroked her face with my finger tips as she lay on top of me. I pulled her to me and kissed her. I held her close and felt the warmth of her body as it lay against mine. She pushed her fingers into my hair and I kissed her again. I was so content that it didn't even occur to me to move. My whole body had been filled with desire all of the time. I had never been so happy.</p> <p>As our kisses became deeper, her hips began to move on me as my hands moved down to stroke her sides and her ass cheeks. My lover's kisses led down to her neck and her shoulders. Her breath and body reacted as she began pulling me into her. Her body moved back as my fingers moved down her body until they touched her breast. I cupped her breast and gave her nipple a slight pinch.</p> <p>She pulled my mouth back as she raised her head to look at me. "Yes," she said. "Oh Master," she said as her bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
