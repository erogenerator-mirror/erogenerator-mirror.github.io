It's so nice to have someone to get to know. You always have been a very nice person."</p> <p>There was a moment of silence.</p> <p>"You're being nice. I'm just a poor soul, to be selfish like that."</p> <p>"Yes I guess you are right. I did start drinking some before coming here."</p> <p>"And I thought you were really nice. Not as nice as you really are, but certainly nicer to be around."</p> <p>"Please, could you give me a break for a second. I'm getting hungry and just want to know if we can have lunch."</p> <p>"I'm afraid you've got more than half of your dinner here already. I want to get to know you and get to know you properly."</p> <p>"Why thank you for offering to come with me. I'm so hungry and I'm worried about how you're going to survive without someone to cook for."</p> <p>"That sounds like a really good plan. What do you mean about helping me?"</p> <p>"Nothing. Not really. I just know that I could really cook for you."</p> <p>"Thank you."</p> <p>Dinner started again. The meal was really great. We didn't really mind how our families would be feeling. Dessert was a nice surprise. We ended up having sex while taking our baths.</p> <p>Afterwards, we talked about the evening and the girls seemed pleased with ourselves.</p> <p>"You have to tell me you weren't honest with me about that one." Anna said.</p> <p>"I was honest with you. It didn't take long before you gave me a hard time."</p> <p>"I didn't mean to say the words. Actually you sounded nice just like I hoped you would. I just wanted to see how you would be when you were sober."</p> <p>"I was hoping you would. I also loved the thought of having a nice meal with you. Maybe you'll want to come back."</p> <p>"Oh, I really need to run. I should probably make a late start on the kitchen."</p> <p>I was glad she had let me go for a minute earlier and took me home. After a long night of talking and drinking the girls had me very tired. As I was going to go check on them later, I heard the sound of voices and saw a couple coming out.</p> <p>"Mom!" said Denise.</p> <p>"Hi Mom! I'm ready for you!"</p> <p>"Oh, honey! You look gorgeous!" was all she could reply.</p> <p>I saw how Denise's eyes kept glancing from Denise to me. She really liked looking at Denise. Her eyes were usually pretty neutral. But now they were more often like we just stared and smiled. And her stare was very sexual. That made Denise's eyes really shine more than anything else. It also helped me to get her to move in with us when she needed to talk to others.</p> <p>"Well, I told you, it's going to be a long night and I'll be back later."</p> <p>"That's better. See you all later." She finished with a hug and a peck on my cheek.</p> <p>I headed out to the garden just as our parents were getting in to their car and started driving. We got to their house about three minutes after they were going in. They had a great pool and sauna. I didn't pay much attention to the driveway, thinking it was another one of Denise's memories of her family. She had it cleaned up pretty good. She was pretty comfortable in a bathing suit but wore it down.</p> <p>"So let's make sure the house is clear, so I can show you around."</p> <p>Denise was taking her mother to dinner. It was a quiet affair. There was a few things, like who would be with whom, but mostly talking about who came into their lives. She was a pretty good cook. She had a great sense of humor. We would have a good time.</p> <p>We arrived home about two hours later. Denise was still in a pretty good mood and seemed a lot more relaxed around me that I would have liked. She was always so outgoing. She always put her things away when we needed to be alone. It was a relief to see her calm down. We could talk for a bit. It was very exciting. She was telling me all of the little things about life in New York. It was a beautiful city and I loved living there for her. I knew what she was thinking and I felt lucky just to have her around.</p> <p>We finally decided to go to bed early. I wanted to lay in bed for a while as we talked. She had to work again tomorrow and wanted the three of us to be together for that night's sex.
