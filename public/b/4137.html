You’re one of the best…”</p> <p>At my surprise, she dropped her paper and started to laugh. “You want to do a little dirty?” She asked, looking me up and down in what could only be considered a “come hither look.” When no answer was forthcoming, she stuck her tongue out at me, and began to walk away from me. I felt like laughing. “Now I don’t have all day.” I exclaimed as I hurried to catch up. When I got to my desk, where I had taken my suit while leaving the meeting that day, I glanced at my watch.</p> <p>At 5:00 AM, my name was called, followed by one of the female secretaries, giving me a polite wave. With my appointment time, I took a quick shower, made sure my ass was still tight in my silk panties, to cover up the bruises I had received earlier. And, I got to work.</p> <p>As the afternoon sun filtered through the window, it started to rain gently. It was dark, and I realized a few things. First, I hadn’t really gotten dressed to leave the office hours before. Second, I had forgotten to pack my jacket, and now, as well as a scarf over my shoulders, I had put my jacket on in the store. After I turned out the lights and went out the door, I called out to the parking lot to see where I could get home, leaving my note of my goodbyes in my hand. Once at home, I called out to my sister, which resulted in her answering her phone on the second ring.</p> <p>“What you gonna do about your mother? Did she ever tell you how great it is to have someone at home that doesn’t really have to be her to handle stuff, you know?” She teased with her laughter.</p> <p>“I don’t really hear much from our mother for the last year.” I laughed, feeling the first stirrings of a smile start to form.</p> <p>“You should give me another chance.” She purred, placing her phone into her purse.</p> <p>I stood for a few seconds, and looked at myself in the mirror, as I had done for her over the past few weeks. My hands were trembling, partly because it felt as if I was trembling with pleasure at what I was about to do to her. As I leaned back in my chair, I felt my nipples start to stiffen. I wanted so badly to wrap them around my nipples and push them into my chest, but I hadn’t even made it back to my room. I was just going to get an opportunity to get one up against the wall, as I imagined some kind of magic device there to make me beg so very hard.</p> <p>I opened the door to the first floor, and heard laughter. “I guess that is what I should do.” Was the exclamation I made at her. I didn’t even hear anything. I wanted an instant response, as I headed towards it. I was still undecided though, if I was going to do anything at all with her. My mind kept going over the many times we’d had sex in the past year. I never once thought that she would have been so turned on, and when I was doing the same thing to her, I couldn’t tell if she had ever been vocal enough. In fact, she never asked me if I had enjoyed her oral pleasuring. I can still remember her saying something about never letting a man fuck her, until I’ve been with her. I have no idea how I was going to act now, but I knew this was the time. I could do whatever I wanted with her; I could kiss and touch, and I could fuck her. I didn’t know what I was going to do with that.</p> <p>I heard, “Good evening sweetheart.” I turned towards her, knowing that she was just about to go away again. I could feel her eyes on my back, and my heart did not skip a beat. Her hands slid up my stomach and slowly started to undo my blouse. My fingers started to slip the fabric of the dress off, just as a man would do for a woman during foreplay, as if it’s—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
