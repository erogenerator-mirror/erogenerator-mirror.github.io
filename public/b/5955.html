She's never had one that was so big yet wasn't too small and not too big in her mind. I felt like an idiot. Well it would have been stupid too, not to go for a blowjob but as it was, I didn't get to see my girlfriend's eyes looking down at my manly appendage pointing straight ahead at her. She was blushing furiously again and looking at my face in the same way. She looked around nervously to see if anyone else was still there so she turned and headed for the restroom. By the time she came back she was completely lost in thought and looked a little embarrassed.</p> <p>"Sorry about being a stupid bitch but I just didn't think you were a gay guy," she said.</p> <p>I smiled weakly and said, "That's okay. It's pretty cute to have sex with you. We can go all out for the drive back," I said.</p> <p>She smiled and said, "Let's hurry and go. I feel pretty worn out," and walked into the bathroom again.</p> <p>The car was still on the road and she still had about 10 minutes left. She climbed in while I drove and I put her skirt up and we started kissing and touching each other. I felt her hands on my breasts and her fingers in my pussy as I felt her fingers running up and down my crack. Suddenly my dress was pushed up and I felt one of her soft hands slip inside it. She started to knead and tease my nipples and I felt that familiar tingle in my groin. It didn't take long for her to get as worked up as she seemed to. She worked my panties off with one hand and I raised my hips to allow her better access. When she pushed two fingers inside of my pussy and rubbed my clit I couldn't hold back and her mouth clamped over my nipple and sucked hard. My climax was approaching and I couldn't have cared less or not if I still felt like that. The feeling of her mouth on my other nipple set my body off and I knew I wouldn't hold back any more. That first climax had left me feeling dizzy and weak and my legs felt like jelly. I was going to lose it. I'd forgotten all about it.</p> <p>I reached out for my wallet to pay and found the pen. I grabbed the paper money and tossed the bill on the dashboard. I walked back into her stall and saw a little sign on the stall door that said 'WOW'. She smiled a little sheepishly and I felt sorry for her. I turned to head back to the car while she got hers and looked at the sign again while we kissed. I heard the voice say, "Can we pull up behind the restaurant?"</p> <p>I said, "Sure. We'll go slow, it's nice."</p> <p>We drove in silence all the way to the restaurant. When we got to the parking area I got out and walked around the front to the back to join her. We leaned in to kiss, again kissing, before she reached out and pulled me tight against her body. One of her hands rested on my breast and the other was working on my pussy. I felt my orgasm building up as she rubbed me and pulled me toward the table. Once we sat down, we moved into a more comfortable position where we were both exposed and were a little more comfortable touching. Our tongues danced with each other as I felt her fingers work my pussy and her tits jiggle every time she rubbed my clit. We both took turns sucking each others tongues as I felt her warm fingers rub her button and I sucked it into my mouth. I was lost in sensations I never felt with her and my orgasm was getting close. If I hadn't been holding back, I'd have thrown up while kissing her and she knew it so she took advantage of my distraction and squeezed both my tits with her other hand until I yelled, "Cumming", which set her off and she started to cum too.</p> <p>She looked up and saw my face and smiled. She got up and went to the bathroom, came back and pulled my skirt up. A few more fingers went inside my dripping pussy and she stopped and turned around to help me out of them. She leaned over to me and we kissed once again while I fingered myself up and down to one point. We came again and I nearly fainted but kept on pushing them aside. We got ourselves together and I kissed her again and we headed back to the restaurant.</p> <p>We got back to the car after the parking lot as normal and headed home with the whole evening left. We hadn't even had a cigarette yet.</p> <p>I'd have to try to find a way to do that againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
