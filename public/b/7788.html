If you don't like that kind of story, this story is not for you. If you are looking for hot and heavy sex, this story is not for you. This story is for two people with needs, desire, and experimentation to find sex that works for them that doesn't endangers them - if that's what you want.</p> <p>*</p> <p>"I love you" - Susan,</p> <p>I was on my cell phone. The message read:</p> <p>'I love you, too, baby, please let me call you when my plane lands."</p> <p>I know that there are more ways around this. It's the only way to get past this as a relationship. I'll never tell the rest of my life. The only way I can hope to end this story is by getting laid.</p> <p>I was about to call her on an airplane. No hurry.</p> <p>"Hi sweetie"</p> <p>"How are you doing?"</p> <p>"I'm okay, actually. What's up?"</p> <p>"Look, you know that I love you. It's no big deal. Now is not the time to tell me I'm not the reason, you know?"</p> <p>"Are you asking me?"</p> <p>"No, honey. When I see you, I know."</p> <p>"Oh, come on."</p> <p>"You know I'm serious. I love you. All I've ever wanted in my life was to marry you. And to spend Christmas with you!"</p> <p>A pause, "Do you love me?"</p> <p>"That's right! I've loved you since the first day of our last year together."</p> <p>"What?!? Why not tell me?"</p> <p>"Because I love you to death. I want you in every way that you want me. I love you. And I'm willing to do that until we get our honeymoon. I'll stop seeing you long before then. Please don't give up on me, baby. I love you. And I would love to be with you forever, and ever. Let's just take it slow on your honeymoon," she said the last in a hushed tone.</p> <p>"Well, yeah, I guess we can. So? What's the flight from Boston to Los Angeles? Are you ready to say goodbye to you life forever and look for more?"</p> <p>"We're there, now."</p> <p>"Yes. We're there. I'm ready for you. I'm about to tell you everything. You'll understand soon enough. You have to hear it. So, tell me, are you ready. Are you?"</p> <p>How did I ever do that? How does one tell the world what you know without saying the same thing to your family? I'm not sure. I'm sure I've never told the entire world my life. Oh, hell, why not? My answer would have to come from a good source. I'd rather hear hers. I already said that I loved her and that I had a daughter. So, there's a reason I have a daughter in law. I do have a daughter. Why not? Why not? And it would have to be something that she loved. Then we could have children together. We can have a baby together. I could even do that.</p> <p>Well, she and I have a child together. I have a daughter.</p> <p>She began, "Well, I like you. You're really pretty. What did you have in mind? How would you feel about that? Will you like to have children together? Will they be good for you? Are you willing to live happily ever after? I'm a happy woman, aren't I? And I'm excited about our child. And I just want to know that you'll say yes. So, tell me, you want to have kids together?"</p> <p>"Are you crazy? That's not what I asked you. We're not going to have kids. We're not going to have a baby. And anyway, I really, really would like to have children if we can agree. We're not going to have children just because you're my wife."</p> <p>"Listen, Susan, you have to know this for yourself. I love you. You don't have to know this, but in spite of what's been happening with my wife and you're husband, we could be together. I would love to have children together with you. But you don't have to know this, because I'd tell your wife the whole truth with no effort on your part, not even to try to stop you. You don't have to know this, because I'm sure that in spite of what's been going on, my wife would never do anything to betray us. We're not going to go all the way with themâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
