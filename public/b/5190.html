He got up and went to retrieve the box of tissues, returning with two. He stood beside me holding them in his large hand.</p> <p>"There's no need now," I said. He looked at me for a moment and then took the tissues. "Are you sure you're okay?"</p> <p>"Just come with me," he said and led me to the sofa. He held me in his arms for a long time while he stroked my hair. He broke off the kiss and moved to sit next to me, looking at his box of tissues.</p> <p>"This is nice," he said. "You didn't have the chance to kiss me after I saw your tits with that tape. I love you."</p> <p>My head was still against his chest, my arms around his waist. "I love you, too," I said, and it was a strange emotion I could not explain.</p> <p>I got back onto the sofa and he sat down next to me and held my right hand. "What are you doing?" I asked, looking up at him. He rubbed his hand gently along the back of my hand. "Are you serious?"</p> <p>"Why would I say I love you? Besides, you know the only reason I want you is to go down on me."</p> <p>"Yes, I guess so," I said. "Because, I love you."</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>I nodded. "I was just hoping you would."</p> <p>"You know, I don't have to," he said. "Just put it in me."</p> <p>It didn't take long. One quick motion and I was sitting on his lap, my arms wrapped around his neck. When I sat, I rested my upper arms on his chest. I wrapped my legs around his sides and I rested my head on his chest. We kissed again.</p> <p>He started slowly, kissing, nibbling, then sucking my lower lip. "Mmm...that's so nice," I moaned.</p> <p>He continued the pattern and I enjoyed it. The kiss became longer and longer. When our lips parted, I kissed his neck, his shoulders. My right hand was touching his chest where his heart beat. I took his right hand to my right breast and pressed it against it. He took my nipple between his thumb and forefinger, rolling it, gently, gently. I squirmed beneath him. I moved his head to my right breast and he licked my nipple, then moved to my left. I let him explore my body as he kissed and licked my tits. When my legs loosened a little, he moved himself to lay next to me. He wrapped one large arm around me, keeping the other in his lap.</p> <p>I got into a more relaxed mood and I felt much warmer as I lay back in his arms. We didn't move except to run our finger tips through each other's hair. He had the softness of his breath tickling me, a light touch that made me shiver.</p> <p>"Does it feel good?" he asked.</p> <p>"So far," I said. "It feels good."</p> <p>I moved my right hand and stroked his cheek with my fingers. "Would you like to feel what it looks like?" I teased.</p> <p>"Yes," he said. His hand found the center of my breast and massaged my nipple. I felt his finger on my nipple with a slow rhythmic motion. "It's nice," I said, taking his hand in mine and running it over my nipple. "You must really like it?"</p> <p>"Yes," he said. His hand slid slowly over my nipple, and in a slow circle. "It's good."</p> <p>"Let's try it," I said. I sat up, sliding my hands down his sides and pulling his cock through his shorts. When his hand met my breasts, I pulled his cock out of his shorts and wrapped my hand around it. I started to stroke him with both hands, watching the expression of our hands on his cock. He moved his left leg over mine. My leg was now wrapped around his cock, and I watched as it swelled just a little.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," he said with a moan. "You're beautiful."</p> <p>I continued to stroke him as I kissed him. I took his right hand and put two fingers into he middle finger on my right hand. He started to move them around, pulling them up and down, and when they touched the hood of my clitoris, my body jerked. "Yes," I said. "Oh, yes."</p> <p>I kissed him, moving his hand into the middle, pressing my chest into his. I moved his fingers a little closer to my clitoris, and his finger stroked it more gently.
