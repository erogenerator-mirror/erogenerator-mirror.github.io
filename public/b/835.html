I said. "We could have finished earlier if we had more clothes, we've got plenty of food in the house."</p> <p>"No, I meant it. If we got an extra shower and put the food away, we would be ready for a change."</p> <p>"How did you get here? Where are the guys?" I asked. She looked at some of the other guys and started explaining the events of the day. "You guys are going to the mall again, so I brought along my clothes." "No, wait a minute," I said. She stood up and started to get dressed. "I guess we still should get out of here, huh?"</p> <p>She got dressed in a few minutes and we walked back to our car. My dad stopped us at the stop sign and said we needed clothes. She changed too and I just had to ask. "If you really want to take this, why don't you come back to the house? You know the rules? No one will bother. They're just going to watch us, don't they?"</p> <p>"They probably will," she said.</p> <p>"No they won't. Those are just my kids, not his, okay?" He said. He was right. The rules were still clear, but I could always stop us. I just drove with them and went home. On the way there she looked around and said, "you look nice out there." I felt stupid. Here we are walking around naked in a seedy bar, and a bunch of friends saw us naked, and we had a drink for dinner.</p> <p>"Thanks for the drink, sweetheart. I feel a bit naughty." I took her hand and the couple walked a bit faster. I kept looking at her and said, "How do you feel right now?"</p> <p>"Not really horny," she said. "I still have the clothes on." She turned around and sat on the stool. "Let's go up to my room." She opened the door and reached into the purse I'd dropped out of the front seat. She held the small overnight bag by her feet so she'd be sure to pull it out, too, before I left.</p> <p>After walking up to her room her room was dark, since there was only the back of one car, but she kept her door open. She turned on the light and asked, "Where are the others?"</p> <p>"Well, there are a couple of guys in the front seat, and the couple in the back two or three rows ahead of us."</p> <p>"Okay, we'll head over there."</p> <p>"Great." I followed her up the steps and opened the door. We got our clothes on and headed back.</p> <p>We stopped at a gas station and picked up the gas for the car. We went to a Walmart store and got out our car keys. She pulled her purse out of the back pocket and handed me mine.</p> <p>"Let's finish getting everything in the car," she said. "See what kind of mess we made in the back." She got out her keys, unlocked my door and took off her shoes. Then she took the money from her purse, opened the purse and saw her money. "No, that's it!" she said. "This is all yours, I'm out of money. Let's finish, too."</p> <p>Our car drove out of the store and they didn't even bother to stop to talk. We drove around a block, then stopped and came back down a block and parked. I got out and put my clothes on. She went out the front door and returned in a minute with a fresh jacket. She said, "The door is closed."</p> <p>She went outside and shut the door, saying, "Come on, let's see this side of the room."</p> <p>We walked down the dark hallway, stopping in the middle, then went up to her room where the door to the right was locked. It didn't matter, she had her keys in her other hand and was leading the way. We got to the door and opened it slightly. There was a couple of guys sitting in the living room. They had their backs against a kitchen chair and their heads turned in my direction.</p> <p>They watched us walking down the hallway, obviously waiting for the answer to their questions. I opened the door so my shoes were in front of the door, then opened it wider, then stepped back and watched her walk slowly, carefully. They didn't hear the shoes until they'd disappeared, then two pairs disappeared.</p> <p>Two pairs appeared on two fronts, the ones I was about to see. One was very big, the one she wore was about eight inches tall, maybe higher. The other belonged to a smaller pair. We stopped by the front door again. We saw the smaller pairsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
