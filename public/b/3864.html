Her pussy clamped down on me then, holding me still inside her as she thrashed wildly on the bed. I could now thrust my hips in and out now. As I thrust into her, she arched her back a little as if to pull more of something. This caused me to start to cum. My cock twitched inside her. As she started to come down from her high I could feel another orgasm growing.</p> <p>She pulled her ankles over my shoulders and pushed me in the air again. She came again, moaning as she came. I was still coming as I moved between her legs then, burying my cock into her as far as I could go. Her soft moaning filled the room as I fucked her. Her legs fell to either side of my head as her head came to rest on her upper arms. Her hands pulled me to her and held me in her, my cock sliding easily into her sopping wet pussy. As our bodies became one, as her hips started another orgasm, her lips pressed flat on my mouth kissing me.</p> <p>I felt her pussy contract rhythmically around me as she came. Her legs loosened at first, letting go of my head then, lowering back down to the bed. The feeling of her pussy squeezing me sent me over the top and I pumped jet after jet into her pussy. I held myself in, still fully hard and thrusting wildly into her. Her hips started a rhythmic motion under me. She pulled my face down to hers and they kissed deeply. I continued to fuck her. After ten years I still could fuck her and still enjoy them as much as she did.</p> <p>Finally we both fell back onto the bed. Her legs parted on each side of me as I lay between them. She cupped my face with one hand as they kissed. I cupped her tit with the other. Our kiss intensified until she pushed me away. She lay down on my chest and pulled my ear to her mouth to kiss me with long, slow wet kisses. It was a wonderful kiss and we fell asleep in a passionate embrace.</p> <p>I don't know if it was the rest of the sex that she experienced or that she was thinking of me and my body and my cock during it. Either way, we were still together as we were.</p> <p></p> <p>The endâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
