When is your trip over?"</p> <p>Jill looked down at her hands which had been gripping the edges of the chair and then looked back up. "Oh. He'll be here in a few minutes. I should probably get going. I'm so glad we have that vacation to do." Jill's hand moved toward the front door and she gave it no thought. She closed her eyes and tried to concentrate on the work that had just been done on the computer.</p> <p>"There is only so much you can do. I'll call you later today. I'll be waiting for you."</p> <p>Jill closed up her book and picked it up and left her office feeling a bit better. She had a very good feeling about why she was doing this because of the things he asked her to do. At the end of the day, she had the entire world watching her and she had no idea how to begin. She made a mental note and sent it away with her own journal. Just as she picked up her phone, she was called directly to her office by the office manager.</p> <p>"Miss Anderson, sir is today's meeting with Miss Breen working?"</p> <p>"That's fine. You have one right there. Please hold on long enough.</p> <p>"No, sir. This meeting is about all of us."</p> <p>"I see, Miss Breen." He was still just as stern with her in-office and she did not like it. She knew at least a little about the company and what was required to do what she was doing here. She was also aware that other employees who did whatever they were required to are also permitted to have what they wanted to do. She wondered at that thought for a moment until then.</p> <p>"Very well, I shall have that meeting."</p> <p>"Good. Please have a seat and we'll begin with some work and enjoy it."</p> <p>Breen had called all the others at several times already knowing that his meeting would begin soon but he did not want his secretary to know that before they finished. He had also heard that when the meeting was finished, he would have the meeting in his office in a matter of minutes.</p> <p>"Jill," he began, "please start."</p> <p>Jill started to speak but stopped. If she was going to say 'yes' to him, she wanted it right this second.</p> <p>"Yes, Sir, I will start now."</p> <p>Breen went back to the folder that she was now writing. "Jill, I think this is important. I'm afraid this is about the way you think a person will act toward you."</p> <p>Jill was trying to think again. She wondered if she could ask for an answer? "Why?" she asked.</p> <p>"First of all, that person is no longer your employee, in which case it is obvious that you are a very attractive woman and you can be very desirable."</p> <p>"Does anyone know how to stop me from talking?"</p> <p>"It is entirely possible," said Breen. "However, if you do, then we should not hesitate to ask you."</p> <p>"Okay, I guess then. What is your problem?" asked Jill.</p> <p>Breen took a page from Jill's book and looked it over. "Miss Breen works on the website that I run for a friend. In fact, I've told her about your background and she just doesn't know how to approach you. Your employer thinks if a beautiful woman has the desire and desire that she has that she should hire you. In my opinion, we women need to be told that we must have a strong work ethic. I think you are intelligent and a very smart woman."</p> <p>Jill was starting to feel better about herself. "That is true. I think I made it clear, Sir. I didn't have any intention of going to a restaurant with someone else."</p> <p>Breen looked up at her and smiled. "You are the person that I am after. I believe that you need to feel the love, attention, and desire that I can give to you."</p> <p>"Thank you, Your Highness." Jill's smile turned to a blush that matched her mood. She took a sip of her drink and looked at Breen with a puzzled look and then looked at the other woman. They had been trying for so long to look into each other's eyes that it seemed unnecessary to ask questions of them. Just then, a man came out of the building at high speed into her office. His face was covered with a smudge of sweat and his lips looked as if they were going to split in two. Finally, he sat back and cleared his throat and looked up at Jill. "I guess that the dinner meeting is over.
