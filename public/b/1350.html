If he stopped talking his cock was still hard and throbbing. I couldn't believe the feelings I was feeling now. The excitement of being watched while being naked was really getting to me, but the desire was still there. I didn't want him to think I was weird and run away; because I truly wasn't anymore. I wanted him to think that he didn't own me anymore but that he could do anything to me he wanted to me.</p> <p>He wasn't being a complete ass. He made me feel good but at the same time, I was feeling so guilty about what had just happened that it was killing me.</p> <p>"We're gonna do what ever you want." He said.</p> <p>"Like what ever you want."</p> <p>"You already know that. Isn't there any other way I can get it up?" He asked with a sly grin. "You're already my slave."</p> <p>"No." I answered meekly</p> <p>"Do you want to be my slave, my slave?"</p> <p>I couldn't really answer him because the emotion I felt for him was still there but I still didn't know what it was. I didn't want this and I certainly didn't want to be his. I had no way of knowing my feelings for him.</p> <p>I leaned over and kissed his cheek as I slid off of the couch and started walking to the bathroom. I went and turned the shower on before joining in with him. He was naked and his muscular body glistening in the light. This time I decided to go with him. He was already hard as fuck so I wasn't going to complain. I sat down on the wet tile of the bathroom floor as he stood in front of me. His hands came up to my breasts and he ran his fingers through my already erect nipples. He started to kiss down my body, teasing the top of my thigh and up my leg just a bit. He worked his way to the base of my cock, taking some of my length in his mouth. I could feel the head of his cock sliding along the top. When the head of his cock touched my leg a shiver went through me. He ran his tongue up the side of my cock and around my head before moving his mouth back down taking my entire length in his. His jaw flexed slightly forcing my cock deeper into his mouth. My hands had moved behind his head when he moved his mouth off of me. My cock was throbbing and begging for more.</p> <p>I moved forward so I was able to get a full grip on both sides of his head and pulled him back. He was so deep in my mouth that I could feel my thighs touch his body. I pushed back onto him, not wanting him to move out of the way. I loved sucking cock. I loved every second of it. Just as I found myself looking to his face for approval, he opened his eyes and looked down on me as my hands gripped his head, trying to get him back down to me. When he pulled himself back away from me, I felt him slowly slide his hand around my body, feeling my hardness. He kept stroking me as he slid his hand down between us, feeling me move on him. Then I felt it, as he slid his finger across my lips. I took hold of his hand with my left hand and guided it back to the base of my cock. I didn't have to tell him anything, it made his mouth feel incredible to touch, to use his mouth on me.</p> <p>He was still stroking my cock, watching me. I kept thinking that he had the same idea, he needed to have it in him, he wanted it in his mouth. I let my hand slide down slightly, pulling him closer to me. He was about to kiss him again when he stopped, not ready this time. I was going to have trouble breathing just from the way he was holding me.</p> <p>"Do you want to be my slave?" He asked, letting me feel his words.</p> <p>"God yes."</p> <p>"Then get on your hands and knees, slave."</p> <p>I got up as he commanded and he reached one hand down from my cock and guided me to lie on my stomach. He knelt behind me, spreading my legs as far as they would go. I could feel his warm breath on my ass as he took me in his hand. He started to push my cock up and down at the same time he lowered his face in my tight ass hole, sucking the head of my cock. His warm lips felt so good surrounding my cock and just when I was thinking I wouldn't be getting a mouthful of his sweet tasting spit, he took me in his mouth. I felt the entire length of my cock disappear in his mouth. His warm tongue caressed me as the pressure of him pushed me closerâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
