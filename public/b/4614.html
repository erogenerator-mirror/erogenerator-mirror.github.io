Alex didn't reply verbally or verbally or physically, but he just kept her in his arms, kissing her forehead, the tip of her nose, neck, the tips of her ears, and every once and a while reaching up to feel and squeeze her breasts as they pressed against each other in their embrace.</p> <p>"Mm I think that might be a good idea."</p> <p>"I'd feel a lot better about it if you did." They kissed again. "But I don't know. I mean this is the first time I have done anything like this with a man, right?" She looked around as she said it, but couldn't see who looked at her, they were both focused on their own activities. "Oh, I am glad we do this. There's no need to be embarrassed. My brother won't be home for weeks."</p> <p>"It's alright," She hugged him tight. "I don't think Alex is going to be angry."</p> <p>"No, he's fine. After all, we've been spending the last couple of months without someone to do anything with either of us this weekend."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm not going to be embarrassed. I'm not ready to just take a shower in the summer and just throw that towel over our clothes. I know I'll want to be clean and sexy for him, or anything else for that matter."</p> <p>"I am. And anyway, don't rush it," he said and kissed her again before they got out of bed.</p> <p>Alex went into the bathroom and changed into a robe. While she was in the bathroom and was getting ready to leave, she felt something. Something strong pressing and massaging, it felt like someone was sliding something through her body.</p> <p>She had no idea what was really happening and didn't know who was doing it. Her heart pounded and she tried to concentrate on her own actions as she was forced into the bedroom. A soft moan escaped her lips, and a hand slid slowly around her ankle, up her calf, and up her thigh. Alex gasped as a finger rubbed over her pussy, slipping softly down between her lips until it slipped up her ass crack and dipped into her anus. She started humping the finger as it dipped between her legs, causing the robe to fall open, giving him a better glimpse of her naked breasts.</p> <p>Alex couldn't believe how turned on she was already, her body was already on fire with arousal and she didn't even know it. It was her first time to have sex, and it wasn't because of any kind of man. It was more than that, but Alex had already experienced it, from her own fingers rubbing her pussy, down to her own fingers, and between their own fingers. She looked around in disbelief as if being discovered naked in public with a stranger, and the thought was so sexy, so erotic.</p> <p>Alex opened the bathroom door and stepped inside, grabbing on to the bathroom door handle. She was about to go back into the room when she felt something rub along her crotch and realized it was the strap on cock she had tried with a toy with a friend who did anal sex for it. Alex was still trying her best to concentrate on what she could not see when she felt it slip between her legs and rest in between her labia.</p> <p>Alex moaned and leaned back, spreading her legs to provide the angle of the cock and begin sliding it up and down her pussy lips. With her other hand she reached behind her and pulled her own nipples as she used her legs to drive the fake cock against her swollen clit. Alex let her fingers slide over the other one, feeling it respond to her own rhythm.</p> <p>Within a few minutes she was on the brink of cumming as her hips began their slow movement, then paused mid-motion as her orgasm overtook her. Alex's hips moved slightly with each thrust but she didn't need to move her hips to make it happen.</p> <p>For Alex, the release was more than she needed to cum, her orgasm was nothing short of a release from an earth-shattering experience. Alex leaned against the wall with the dick sticking straight up in the air, pressing on her clit and feeling what her body took to be a massive orgasm.</p> <p>It was more than Alex imagined possible feeling, more than anything she could ever imagine. It was an experience she had for so long, and now that it hit her she couldn't ever want anything like what it was: She loved it. The feeling of the cock pushing in and out as her own orgasm took control of her. Alex was just as hard, if not harder, than she thought she was. Alex wrapped her legs around the fake cock and pulled it in for the final time.</p> <p>Alex finally had control of her body and she rolled over so she was faced away from the door. She leaned back against the wall with the cock resting on herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
