"Where... how... where are you? What's happened?" he exclaimed, running over to stand behind the desk.</p> <p>"I am a nurse," she said, leaning forward with a smile. "So I will probably never hear you talk again."</p> <p>"What you... what do you say I go and see about getting back on my feet again..." he trailed off.</p> <p>"What? Are you happy now? " she asked. "That is why I came over. I was getting tired."</p> <p>It was strange. That strange feeling. I felt guilty and a little guilty... maybe this was all just a bad dream. He was too young for that. And he's dead because of all the drugs we made him take. I guess I should go find him."</p> <p>"No, I'm sorry." he looked at her, worried. "We can't lose him after all they did. And besides I wanted you back." He held up a finger.</p> <p>"Noooo! I don't want to be... with you anymore... in the morning... how about you call and let me take my pills for a while." She smiled shyly.</p> <p>"No..." he put his hands on her shoulders. "I'm sorry. I would have had to wait for you to let me finish."</p> <p>"How about I come over and take mine now? And you can see for yourself what I have been showing." She winked at him.</p> <p>"OK, but...." He pulled her up and she hugged him. "I'm... I'm scared..." he whispered as he leaned over and kissed her lips. "I need to stop now."</p> <p>"Don't stop... right now..." she was crying, and he pressed her back against the edge of the desk.</p> <p>"Baby, don't go so slow," he said. "It's been too long since I have been with a woman. I still have time to save you. Even if we never come again. No matter what... please make me stop..." Her words were so soft he could kiss her even better than last night. And he would never get up from his bed for anything. He had to admit that he was just feeling the need to take her. She was beautiful and so smart. And his hormones were pounding so hard and fast. He started pumping his hips and she held on to his ass. The feeling of her so wet... she was so smooth... so warm.</p> <p>"I'm scared," he breathed in her ear. "It's been so long...." She moved away to see him, still on top of the desk.</p> <p>"Yes, it's been all too long... " she put her hands on his chest, smiling nervously. "Baby... you don't know what you are talking about..." he kissed her neck and back again. Her hand moved along his chest. She pulled on his shirt, and suddenly he got up off the desk.</p> <p>Naked, he walked over to where she sat and looked at her. He walked over to her side of the desk, and she put her arms around his neck, and leaned towards him so he could get a better view of her. "Baby... we... we can't..." she said, trembling.</p> <p>"Come with me," he breathed in her ear. "My job is not done yet. I will see to things for you after I return. "He reached out and cupped her breast. "Are you sure you want me to stop?" He kissed her neck again, and she moaned. He kneed them and squeezed gently. They looked at each other's faces. He kissed her deeply again and put an arm around her waist. "You are very beautiful," he said in her ear. "I didn't know you were interested."</p> <p>She bit his earlobe. "I want you to know that, you are very much... in love with one of the most beautiful women I have ever met." She kissed him deeply again and his hands were holding her. He kissed her breasts all over before finally pushing out of his jeans and moving his hand up to her ass and cupping it in his fingers, then up her back, he was on his knees and was pulling her back towards him. He pulled up her shirt to expose her breasts, and with that she put her hands behind his neck and pulled him down to her face. She kissed him deeply, and he held up her face with his hand; he kept kissing her face all the way; she wrapped her long nails on the back of his neck and pulled him closer. He pulled up her bra, and took her breasts in his hands; each breast was small like her, but with a small areola on their end, and her nipples were darker now.
