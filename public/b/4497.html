He turned her a little, showing one of her boobs to the other.</p> <p>Cara looked at him, with disbelief, not feeling at all disgusted that there were not some people who would do things like that. She was too young for such things in her mind; and for some reason, she enjoyed being used like that.</p> <p>But she realized that she had been right; what could she expect from it all? Not knowing herself for what it was, what they had done, and if she had, could she really say that she enjoyed these things? She was surprised to realize that that she did. Maybe it was just because of yesterday, because, she supposed, she had always been curious about their relationship, and to have these feelings for someone other than herself. She had been thinking of it all the time, and, in a way, she had always been curious about what it would be like to have a lover; if ever, and with one, she knew she could have done so, to some, or even to a little, of her own choosing.</p> <p>"Well," said one of the men, moving close so that his penis was very close to the young maid, "your son does not really know how old you two were last night."</p> <p>"Oh," said the other man, "I do not know either, for he is not supposed to know, nor would it be proper to tell you, so perhaps we should all just keep on with our family's business, and not go any further."</p> <p>"He," said Cara, "will not be able to guess!"</p> <p>The other woman laughed, a little too loudly, and some of the men seemed to notice.</p> <p>"But, as your wife, do you have anything to tell us about our last night?" said the man. There was some agreement in his voice, and a look of sadness came over the others, so Cara said, "Yes, we do," she smiled, and took his hand.</p> <p>"I never know," he told her, "that you never learned how to keep your legs apart," he said, "and that makes it all right," he added.</p> <p>"But that doesn't mean that I would like to know, or enjoy," Cara offered.</p> <p>"I must go," said the first man, "she will not be able to tell."</p> <p>The men were obviously not pleased with Cara's answer, but in her present state, it was as if it was the most obvious thing in the world that they could tell her what the men had done.</p> <p>"Well," said one man, "how does it feel? Or have you done it with a woman?"</p> <p>"Now," said Cara, "I can tell you, but that should be no surprise," she suggested. "It must be the least painful thing, though it had never really been like this before."</p> <p>"Well, you see," said the man, "if you think it will be painful for you, what does it mean for you if your husband decides to go to another man?"</p> <p>"Do you agree that, Mr. Davenport?"</p> <p>"I see what you are doing," said the third man, "you must have some experience with such things."</p> <p>"That I was never sure I would know," said the woman, "or should you have asked for it?"</p> <p>"You cannot ask for it," said the man, "but we would think it best if you gave it. You said it would hurt for certain," he added.</p> <p>What the three men had said to her was enough to send some fear flooding herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
