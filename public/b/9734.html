I was so proud and she was looking a great deal closer to me. She was wearing a simple button-and-down shirt, with a nice blazer around her chest. Her short brown hair was loose, but a little longer than mine, and she had a nice, healthy tan, and, to top it all off, she had this very sexy smile that could melt any man's heart.</p> <p>"Okay," she said, suddenly. "I'm sorry, Mark. I didn't mean to upset you."</p> <p>"It's fine. We need to talk, don't you think?"</p> <p>"I...uh, well, if it's ok with you guys, we need to talk."</p> <p>"Well, you have your own problems to take care of," I said. And I reached out and touched her thigh.</p> <p>"Mark, I can't..." she said, looking down and looking at something on the floor.</p> <p>"Mark, come get help. I won't say anything."</p> <p>She nodded and got up and rushed to the bedroom to get dressed, then she hurried to the bathroom and started a shower. Within minutes she came out and looked down at me with an embarrassed expression on her face – she had thought I was her boyfriend.</p> <p>She stepped into the water and said, "Well, you look so nice," and put her arms around me.</p> <p>"It's not too warm, is it?" I asked.</p> <p>"No, it was the truth."</p> <p>"No it wasn't. It was...it was...I don't know what to call it. It sounds wrong, but it didn't feel wrong at all."</p> <p>"I think there's something to be said for it, too," I said.</p> <p>"Maybe."</p> <p>"Are you okay? If you're not, we can do this again," I said, looking at her.</p> <p>"If you're doing whatever you're doing now...yes - again."</p> <p>"I'd love to, but I think it's best if I wait until it'll be over, so you can go home," I said.</p> <p>She got out the shower, got dressed, and we sat on the couch and talked. I told her how much I really loved her, how much I felt special for her, and how lucky I am to know someone who is so happy and so happy to be with me.</p> <p>"I'm so glad I'm here with you," she said. "I didn't want to talk about it."</p> <p>"Please don't. It's more about how hard it will be for you to explain why you feel this way about me and that, just as I feel about you..." I added.</p> <p>"Mark, it's been really weird for a long time, that's for sure. And, no, it's not easy."</p> <p>"Oh, but I could, at least for a change, and we can work through this together."</p> <p>She looked at me and smiled, then she took my hand. "Let's go upstairs and I'll get you set out for work and you can pick out the stuff you need today. I'm gonna take a quick bath and then pick you up tomorrow. Is that okay if I bring the stuff?"</p> <p>"Of course," I answered, giving her a warm smile. "We'll go shopping tomorrow, but right now I need to finish packing some clothes out and I'm gonna go hang out with my friends."</p> <p>"Okay, babe. I won't worry. So, are you ready to go home with me?" she asked, smiling that radiant smile.</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm ready. Just not sure this is the right time."</p> <p>***********************</p> <p>I didn't know what to wear, as of yet. So that's how I was dressed. It was a cute blue blouse with a nice, thin, lightweight skirt, so it was a little shorter than what I was wearing. But, really, it was all to good to look good, so I went out to the car wearing a pair of black, strapless, and very short, tight slacks. I went home to change and went directly to my room so I could get my bag out to make my move. I changed into the slacks and then went out to get some dinner, and some drinks. I walked into the den as the lights were down, and was standing near the television, waiting for her reaction. I was actually looking to see what she would be wearing. Well, I was actually looking for her reaction to our conversation, and for any reaction I wasn't able to get out of—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
