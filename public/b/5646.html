Don't you remember? He's going to be there, as well."</p> <p>Doris didn't even say anything; she was a little surprised but glad to hear what Doris had to say. "Thank you. You and your son just made me so happy. I just hope this isn't a one time thing. I want to be a good girl for you."</p> <p>"Do you want me to take you home with me? You can use my car; it's insured."</p> <p>"I'm not that kind of girl."</p> <p>"I didn't say you were or weren't," said Doris as she grabbed the key to the door and they both stepped inside. She knew that had happened many times now, and as a mother, she felt she had to be the tough one, and she wasn't too surprised by his reaction. They went up into one of those large bedrooms and as they were waiting for the guest to return from work, Doris took his hand and guided him to lie on the bed with her right hand.</p> <p>As he watched her, he couldn't bring himself to object, and as she led him back to his bedroom, he found that he was still completely erect, and as soon as she closed the door she said. "Let's put these shoes on and get this nightgown on so that you can look at you in a different light."</p> <p>Doris was right, they were all the sexual lamps she had, but she did put a pair on and began to pull the nightgown up. She could tell that he didn't believe her, and as soon as she was done she asked him. "Will you please come up for a minute. I have something else we have to tell you." Without looking around, she got back on her hands and knees and turned toward the doorway at the end of the bed. After her husband had returned to work, she moved to change position. "I love the way you look."</p> <p>"I could use a drink or two from the bar," he said.</p> <p>"Or maybe you could help me get dressed."</p> <p>"What do you think's my shirt and bottom for the day?"</p> <p>"You look great."</p> <p>"Thanks," she said and turned again to see her husband standing in the hall looking at his wife. She was wearing a blouse that buttoned from top to bottom, and with just a wisp of a skirt on top of it, she looked fantastic. "I can't believe it's really you."</p> <p>"I didn't realize it would be you," he said as he walked over to her. He took her face and looked in her eyes. "Why didn't you come in here at all?"</p> <p>Her reply was to take his shirt in her hand and pull it off and throw it on the floor behind her. She could feel him standing there as she tossed his shirt over. "I have something to tell you about me. So, how did it work?"</p> <p>"It was easy to slip into the chair."</p> <p>"Can you tell me what it took?"</p> <p>"There's nothing in there that makes me feel comfortable."</p> <p>"What's not to do, is lie back and relax. What happened in your dream doesn't really count."</p> <p>"And what about your son?"</p> <p>"When he comes home, he'll find me in my bra or, if I'm not too drunk, in my panties. He knows that I like women in underwear and he won't be mad if I do it."</p> <p>"Well, you got me."</p> <p>"That's what I want."</p> <p>"Oh, you make me sound like a slut."</p> <p>"You're a slut. It's a sin to be so open to the world. I've got to tell you something else. You can't tell your son about this, can you."</p> <p>"Why not?"</p> <p>"Because that would be too embarrassing. So, what happens now?"</p> <p>"I tell him. Then I'm going home and I don't bother him for a while."</p> <p>"Oh," he said as she said it, but she quickly said it againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
