It made me feel as if I was finally free, and I needed to give that a piece."</p> <p>He smiled, and leaned in to kiss me. A brief kiss, but nothing much more. Soon our mouths were locked on, and our bodies pressed against each other as we made out. It began, with hands wandering up and down our backs and between our open thighs. We stopped kissing for a moment, and looked down at our hands resting on each other. He was stroking my thigh, moving from the softness of my pussy up to my hips where he brushed his hand against me. His touch turned electric.</p> <p>In time to turn out the lights, we began removing each other clothes, and to begin our sex. He slowly and lovingly undressed me. I lay on top of him as he took care of my cock and balls, and the feeling of his skin at my cock as he rubbed his shaft. It felt good, and I wanted more; but his mouth had to remain the same. I laid my head in his neck, and felt his tongue slide around the ridge of my ear. He put some lotion on, and began massaging his hands into my back. He moved one hand to my ass, sliding it up and down, and occasionally to my balls. He took me deeper into his mouth and sucked me in, pushing back into him, making wet slurping noises. After he had slid his finger in my cunt, he turned me on my side, lying on my back, and started massaging my balls and ass, while kissing my ass. After having played with, and been penetrated, I began to feel my orgasm rising. He was a pro at this game, and I loved the feeling of his finger moving in and out of me.</p> <p>He got up off the bed, bringing a dildo with him, and we both used the dildo together to enjoy the sensation. It was wonderful, and I was having the time of my life. Our orgasms came more quickly, and we spent many hours masturbating together. We were both exhausted after our intense sex, and he fell back asleep with me.</p> <p>I awoke, and lay there for a few minutes, reveling in the wonderful feeling of being completely and totally satisfied. And then, feeling guilty, I quickly got up and went to the bathroom, washing myself.</p> <p>As I came in the room, his head was turned toward me. "My God, what have I done," I thought. "I can't do this." He was still naked, and I noticed he had a very hard cock, which made me wonder if I would be able to handle him. I stripped off my panties, and climbed into the shower. He was already in and had already showered, and turned out all lights. He dried himself off, and led me out to the bed where we began kissing, and fondling each other. I could feel his hard cock pressing against my lower back and ass. He was not yet hard, and his pre-cum made my ass slick with his cum. He moved between my legs, and rubbed his cock up and down my slit. I could feel his head pushing into me, and just barely felt it stretching my pussy lips, and I felt the wetness of my labia as it slid along his shaft. I spread my legs wider, wanting him deeper into me. After several seconds of stretching my pussy lips, he suddenly slid his rigid rod all the way in. He stayed there for a couple seconds, and I felt him fill me with his hard dick.</p> <p>I took a moment to consider what it felt like to be filled by him. Then suddenly, and seemingly out of nowhere, he rolled to the side leaving my pussy entirely full of his dick, which was still fully imbedded with the end of it still resting just outside my pussy.</p> <p>"I know you want to do it again," he said. "Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere." I lay there and listened to his breathing and his hips thrusting inside my cunt. I could feel him moving around in my body, and I could feel my own juices covering his shaft as he thrust into my cunt, creating a new channel for him. He pulled my legs up onto his shoulders, and began humping me. The more I moved back against him while he fucked me, the higher his penetration became. He moved his hips against my ass, feeling the softness of my ass as it slid on his pelvis. I looked down to see his body moving in unison with mine, and I could see his eyes darken with arousal. I knew I wanted him as much as I did, so I began slowly rotating my cunt on his dick, with hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
