My emotions were all over the situation, my only thought was "Was she as gorgeous as I thought she was?"</p> <p>Her eyes met mine and she turned her head slightly to one side as she said, "Yes David, if you would just turn your face a little more towards me, maybe you could kiss me in bed once more."</p> <p>I had no idea if I imagined it, but as I turned my head, I saw her lips smile at me when her eyes looked at my eyes as I turned to her in the mirror. She smiled at me and I felt myself blushing.</p> <p>I had decided not to push it, and it would never really do any good; I did think I would have to turn the discussion, but her offer of a kiss. She liked to kiss; not the way mothers kiss, but just the way mothers kiss...</p> <p>"David, you're doing so well." The woman said as the door closed behind the girl, "Your mother says that you're a natural born lover."</p> <p>I heard her move and the words she uttered sounded familiar, which only confirmed what I was feeling. I felt the heat of an inner fire in my head and I turned back with a grin on my face. She was looking straight at me as she said it, but she had a look of lust in her eyes.</p> <p>"Well?" she asked as she reached for the hem of her robe.</p> <p>I glanced sideways at her and saw her eyes were glazed even more than mine. And then I thought of a few things in a moment. "Well, I..." she started as she looked at the towel, "I have been feeling very nervous... and this thing that I am having with our first child was very exciting."</p> <p>"Well... well, I think you shouldn't have..." I tried to assure her.</p> <p>This gave her pause, as she turned even more slowly, her eyes meeting mine. Then she looked at me and a smile broke on her face.</p> <p>"David? I... well..." She hesitated again, her eyes looked away from me, "David do you really understand that you are going to carry in my child as I have?"</p> <p>Again I did not know if this was true or not, but looking into her eyes, I knew it was. I took one last look at my daughter and was reminded that she was the mother of my son's child.</p> <p>"Yes Mrs. T." I whispered, unable to look away.</p> <p>She smiled again and turned back towards the mirror.</p> <p>"David, please understand that I'm going to be disappointed if you aren't happy in having to go home with us as your son." She said as she walked towards the door.</p> <p>When she walked back to me there were tears running down her cheeks, but she said, simply,</p> <p>"Mom said I should be happy, David, that it is alright for you to take my son under your wing."</p> <p>It took me a minute or two to wrap my head around what she just said. It was the same thing from her mother.</p> <p>I leaned forward until our lips met. It was the first time, after all, I had kissed a woman before, when she kissed me. It had only been the second time, and it had felt awkward, but it felt good.</p> <p>"We are very well behaved, David" She leaned forward to whisper in my ear and smiled at me as she turned and walked to the door.</p> <p>My feelings were still on fire, and it was getting harder every second. Maybe it was the thought that no more than a month had passed, but that it had been so long and my heart still didn't hurt anymore. Maybe it was that I thought it to feel less about her when I saw her walking towards me.</p> <p>But as I looked at myself, I saw that I could still do it. As we began to drive home, the thoughts that I still had were swimming around inside...</p> <p>---</p> <p>The next week was still so confusing. I had tried to think of it in front of her, in a detached sort of way, that it was something she wanted. That she wanted to see my baby again, after all, we had done it many times before. My mind was reeling from this thought.</p> <p>For the first time, the thought of what happened between us while we were living together began to seem like an accident. And it was that very wrong of me to think that I shouldn't be so attracted to my daughter. That the only reason it was even that she was there when I was alone was because I knew, and loved, that I would love her too.</p> <p>But as I thought about it, some reason, maybe the fear I had, I was a little more at ease and beganâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
