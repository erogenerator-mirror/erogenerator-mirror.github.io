I stepped out from the bushes and approached the door. I had just opened the latch when I was attacked by a pair of women. I stood their in the doorway and felt my groin contract in anticipation of my next move. I looked around and spotted Tom, my friend who had helped me up to the bedroom before I had come in.</p> <p>He looked at my new found friend and said, "I heard what you were doing, it sounds like you saw a ghost but I'm not the one who saw it, can I come in and say hello?"</p> <p>He walked into the room and said, "Well at least that's what I wanted to hear, so I did say hello to you."</p> <p>He walked over to me and said, "This has taken the edge off my mood, I'm glad I came through tonight, because I want to be in your company again, even if it means that I'm going to fuck his brains out right in front of you tonight."</p> <p>Then he walked away and left me standing there with my hand behind my back and his cock in my crotch and feeling the effect of each word as each step we went down. And at the same time, I was imagining what it would be like to be between those strong legs. I reached down and took his cock in my hand and held it while I bent down in front of him until his cock head touched my lips. I could barely breathe and knew that it must be very difficult for me to breathe, but as I sucked up and down his hardness, I could feel it beginning to swell in my mouth when he took his hand from my hair and moved me down to where I was kneeling on the carpet where he stepped back enough to get a good look before continuing his direction. Just the feel of his cock head against my lips made my body shudder with each passing second. I knew that what I wanted would be even better and hoped that he would be as eager to satisfy my most basic needs as I was.</p> <p>I kept my eye on his cock and thought to myself what a beautiful man he was. It didn't take me long to realize that his body had an entirely different kind of muscle under there. Just seeing his muscles move told me something about him he knew. I was in awe of him.</p> <p>He took his cock in one hand, gently stroking it up and down and then leaning back and looked down at me again, giving him a slight smile before getting down on his knees before me. He looked at my body and saw that I was as turned on as I was. He took his cock in both hands and began to rub the head over my pussy lips, spreading my juices over my lips so that it would be easier to slide over them and let me feel every inch as it slid over them. I was soaking his fingers now, and I couldn't wait any longer to have his cock inside me. I closed my eyes and leaned back to let him do this for a while, and to relax my body and let him do what he wanted. I wanted it to feel like it would never end. He must have been a master at knowing my body and he never said a word as he slid his cock into my steaming cunt.</p> <p>To say that he was moving in and out of me was a statement of fact, and my legs began to shake all over. I felt so alive, like I had just discovered the sexual depths of a world of my own and could do anything to it. It wasn't long before there was a low groan from my chest that I was able to turn into a loud moan when he pushed hard into my clit and began to pound into me. He kept this up and then slowed down before giving me the chance to get back on my feet, but even that seemed to be enough to set me over the edge to cum and so I just fell to my knees as he continued to thrust in my cunt. There was no stopping now. I started to lick the head of his cock as it entered and exited my mouth, trying to get as much of it in my mouth as I could so I could keep up while I could suck on it. My fingers found another cock and wrapped around it as his ass started to move back and forth. And if he was enjoying this, then he seemed to be enjoying it very, as did I. As I had seen in almost every porn flick, I found he enjoyed doing this. Having me so wet and swollen with my mouth sucking on his cock was so intense. His fingers reached up and he played with my ass.</p> <p>We were both sweating at this point, and I couldn't tell whether it was from the hot sun or the sexual heat coming from inside our room.
