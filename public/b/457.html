It looks pretty nice too." He had his shirt off, and had his head around again. "I know it's hot," he said with an exaggerated pout.</p> <p>"I thought you said you wouldn't be here, that you were going to have a quick shower."</p> <p>"I don't know if showering with no one to watch me wash out would be that much fun without people coming along. Besides I'm not going to get in trouble if you see me with a towel around my waist."</p> <p>"I think after that, I think it's ok," Josh said.</p> <p>"Just to let you know that I am going to go in that shower right now and wash the chlorine off."</p> <p>"I'll go ahead if you want," Josh said, "and don't worry about it."</p> <p>"What do you mean by that? That I have to clean up at home?"</p> <p>"Yeah, my dad made me clean up. That is his job. He is in charge of cooking around the kitchen. I don't even think he did my dad a very good job and there was a bit of a mess in the kitchen when he worked."</p> <p>"I thought mom and dad had the house cleaned up by now. They just didn't think you had enough time."</p> <p>"That would be ok with me, I figured we could have a couple days alone."</p> <p>"We just met yesterday, so it doesn't sound like much anyway. I will give you two a couple days together, just to test the waters."</p> <p>That brought an idea into his mind. He wanted to watch me shower with someone that I knew, it looked like my dad too and he even got a kick out of watching me masturbate to me naked in his family room with my father watching. He would be home in less than ten days, and then he would be free of mom for Christmas, New Years, and the last of their vacation. He didn't know, he couldn't bring himself to admit it to himself, but he had to at least get into the shower. The idea of watching me in the shower or in a movie gave him a hard on. He pulled in to the driveway to the front door and found his friend, his uncle, there.</p> <p>"Hey there, baby," he said. He had a large goofy smile on his face, it looked even more goofy with their eyes locked together. He smiled in acknowledgement and turned to go in. "Dad, Josh."</p> <p>"It's good to see you again, my son." He was still smiling, and his eyes still had a smile, "This must be your dad," he said, "I heard he was working on a commercial."</p> <p>"Hi, Josh," he said, "You are so happy to see me." He had a huge heart on his face too, he was smiling and laughing through the whole exchange.</p> <p>As he finished coming out, his uncle ran over and hugged him tightly. "He really is just looking out for you Josh, my uncle," he said, "And I know it is only a matter of time before you start the business and we won't have to work so hard to keep our family together."</p> <p>"Yeah," Josh said.</p> <p>"I know, I'm happy you feel like you are being a good son again. I just wish I could do the same for you."</p> <p>"I hope you're ok with my dad in there." Josh replied.</p> <p>"Of course I'm glad to hear it, I told him that he should be a good father to you and that we are going to help you grow some of the weight off your mom, we just want you to get back to a normal healthy self."</p> <p>"I'm going to have another shower with him. Just let me get my clothes."</p> <p>Josh chuckled to himself. His brother wasn't his only uncle. He couldn't tell the father, but he told him about it and Josh had to agree with that. If they were going to be parents of his own, they knew that it would have to be something they would really want. Josh could help with getting him a couple hours of quality time with him and some of the money he owed his dad.</p> <p>"What do you say dad?"</p> <p>"We might be spending the evening," he said, "You would go to bed early."</p> <p>"Sounds like a good idea, it should be interesting," he said. "Come on, I'll get your stuff." He opened the door of the truck, opened the driver's door, and helped him out. He took his helmet off and waved her to help carry in her gear. Josh helped her back into the house.
