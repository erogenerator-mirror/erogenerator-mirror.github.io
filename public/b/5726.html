I mean, well, you're not mad are you? Well, maybe a bit. But no, I'm not mad at him. I'm not even mad that he's staring at me and looking at my boobs. I'm mad that I let him look at my tits. So what? I'm glad I let him look," she said, smiling again.</p> <p>"So what? And just what's going to happen tomorrow?" Tim said, getting up.</p> <p>"Well, we were sitting around the house, and he got up, and he pulled down those jeans and just stared at me. And I looked down, and it was all kinda funny. I don't know, what the heck, what have I done? I'm not gay because I've just had sex with a strange guy," she said.</p> <p>Tim got himself up a bit, and went in the kitchen. He came back in the room with two glasses, and they sat down and took a sip.</p> <p>"So, I mean, is this some kind of joke or an accusation or something?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, no funny business. And what's going on the guy's all the way over here? Did you tell him?" she said.</p> <p>Tim looked at the way she spoke, and said, "Yeah, right, he just looked at me for a minute, and looked back over at me and smiled again. I mean, that was funny. The guy looked at me, you know, and then he just smiled. That was weird, not like I thought. I think I looked at that guy in a funny way."</p> <p>"Are you sure it wasn't some random stranger touching you?" she asked, smiling.</p> <p>"No, no, I'm sure it was just him looking at me. He's a guy. He's just looking at my boobs, not you. It isn't like I'm a kid looking at his wife or anything," he said.</p> <p>"So, it was more a... sexual thing then? And then did you guys like him?" she asked him.</p> <p>"I don't know," Tim said.</p> <p>"Well, it was kinda... hot when he looked at me, wasn't it? So, what's going on? I mean, you know, we said all this stuff," she said.</p> <p>"Yeah, well, it's pretty obvious that I've got some nerve. And, um, I'm not like, I don't know why they'd just look at that guy again, but then I saw his face go up, and he was smiling. Then I saw his hand touch my... my breast. Then he just looked, and the next thing I know, he's just kissing me on the cheek, and I kissed him back and then..."</p> <p>Tim was embarrassed at himself, but at the same time he was glad to not just be getting his ass kicked. There were plenty of gay guys who were more or less straight than that. And a couple of them could have gotten him to do that, but Tim didn't want to see any of that crap again.</p> <p>"But, I mean, I'll admit that he really looked at me, and I can't blame him. I'm not a kid anymore, I can be older and wiser."</p> <p>"You should check out girls your age, you know, older men," Tim said.</p> <p>"Well, what do you mean?" she said.</p> <p>"Well, look at you," Tim said.</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Yeah, really. Look at him. You know, he's not exactly skinny, but he's not fat, either. You'd think he was old. You are like, in your early fifties. It's all the guys around here are guys in their sixties and seventies, right? Guys looking at you. Look at you, you seem to be younger, and even though you're older, still hot. I mean, is that what you want?"</p> <p>Tim looked at her in amazement. "How?"</p> <p>"Well, let me tell you, don't get me wrong. I'm not a kid anymore, I just do what guys tell me to do. That means I do things like this. But now that I think about it, I might be able to do things. But I'm not sure the guys around here seem gay and interested."</p> <p>"So, you're not going to..."</p> <p>Tim sat there with a dumbfounded expression on his face. She was right. She was not going to tell him that she was a lesbian.</p> <p>"That's up to you."</p> <p>"Yeah, right," she said. "So.
