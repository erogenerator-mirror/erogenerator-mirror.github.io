"You’re mine."</p> <p>He kisses me as I start to grind against him.</p> <p>"Do you like fucking my big cock?" His words come out slightly strained.</p> <p>"Oh yes, you feel so fucking big," I tell him as I try to move slowly up and down on him to keep his cock in my pussy. I love feeling him go in and out of me, so full, so big as I feel him fill me completely.</p> <p>"You’re so fucking tight," he groans as he pushes me back down, „God you’re so fucking wet!”</p> <p>I start to ride him harder and faster, feeling his cock hit my g-spot in the right position each time.</p> <p>„That’s it you fucking slut," he groans as he kisses me hard, “I love it when you fuck like this," he moans as he runs his fingers through my hair as he pushes me down in the bed.</p> <p>I feel the wet warmth of him on me as he slips in me, „fuck yes, you feel so fucking good," he moans as I feel his fingers sliding up and down my crack. I spread my legs as he starts to slide in and out of me, slowly at first, sliding his cock back out, then sliding it in, slowly moving towards the top now, he kisses my neck while he starts to pump slowly in and out of me. His hands slide up my body to slide my shirt up above my belly button, he kisses me as he plays with my nipples and I start to rub my hands down his back and down his sexy thighs, feeling his cock fill me so completely. A few pumps more and I feel him tighten as he cums, the feel of his cum on my pussy sends me over the edge and I cum hard on his cock, making his eyes roll in the back of his head. He doesn’t slow and I can feel each spurt of cum deep inside of me as he fills me up.</p> <p>He falls on me, his lips on my ear as we both drift off to sleep.</p> <p>The next morning is pretty awkward. As he is leaving he tells me to tell him everything when he comes back for me. It has been about 15 minutes and I can see the door is open a crack. I look up to see who it is and almost cum when we both saw her.</p> <p>„This is my wife," he says. I feel a thrill of excitement run through my body, I can feel my nipples getting hard, I can feel his cum drip out of me and down my cleft. "This is her best friend, Melissa.”</p> <p>He tells me his story as soon as he walks in the door as I can’t believe how great she looks in her bikini.</p> <p>„Your name is Melissa," he tells me as he hugs me against him from behind. "Is that better?"</p> <p>I smile back at him and whisper „My god, yes!"</p> <p>„I was your best friend?" I blush then giggle as he gives me my second chance so I can't tell if he saw my boobs.</p> <p>„Well it’s ok with me," he says, "but you look even sexier in those things than normal." He pulls me closer to him and caresses me again with his hands.</p> <p>"I always have to make these little outfits for you." He pulls me closer to him, leans in and presses those soft lips against mine, „just remember, you’ll be my slut."</p> <p>He kisses me again and then walks out of the door. I pull him into my arms and hug him, kissing him as we slip off to bed. As we fall asleep a strange feeling starts in the pit of my stomach. It’s all I can do not to cry in his arms. I have felt it before in the past, not that my mom had a lot to do with it; just that it was a sexual thing and we had to stop it. I have fantasized about it since it started; just to stop it and just for him to do what he told me he would before we had sex.</p> <p>I woke up late the next morning feeling so good, I can still feel his cum on my thighs as I lie there for a few minutes. I know I still had to tell him. I start to slowly get up, feel him kiss me again as I stand on tiptoe to kiss him, but it starts to scare me, the idea of telling him all the terrible things I have done but not being able to do the things I had done with him.</p> <p>I look over to the clock, it is 5:59—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
