It's ok just watch and enjoy. He smiled back as his thumb circled the engorged helmet. She looked at the other guys' face and slowly began to unbutton his shirt. A light moan escaped her lips as she slid the shirt off his shoulders and her eyes widened when she saw his torso. The dark tan of his chest was the first to disappear as his nipples hardened. She loved her first real breasts. Her soft hands slid over his abs and she was pleased to see the veins along his chest. He pulled his shirt from his pants and threw it on the bench beside him.</p> <p>He moved closer to her and she took a deep breath. Her lips slid over his head softly as his body moved closer and he inhaled sharply. She ran her tongue along his shaft as her lips sealed around it and she looked up smiling. She pulled him into her mouth slowly, loving every second of it. His hand came up to her head and with gentle pressure he began to pump his hips. She loved the feel of his hands, his gentle strength. With each thrust she could feel the bulge of his cock as it rubbed against her lips. He pushed her down against the bench as he drove his cock harder and faster inside of her as his fingers fumbled about searching for something to pleasure. Her hands reached for his hips and her fingers tangled in his thick hair.</p> <p>As his finger dug into her hair he began to thrust deeper into her mouth and she let out a moan as she felt him filling her. She was wet, hot and ready. Her clit was swollen and her breathing came in short, sharp bursts of ecstasy. Then she felt him move his hand from her hair and she opened her eyes to see him taking her from behind in the dark. His big arms surrounded her waist as he thrust deep, hard and fast into her mouth as his thumb began to rub her clit. The moans she heard coming through the speakers grew louder and she tried to pull away. Her eyes met his own as he began to thrust harder and deeper. The sound of his breathing told her he loved her and as her fingers clawed at his chest her orgasm exploded from her. Her own loud screams of pleasure echoed around the crowded room.</p> <p>When her body finally stopped quivering she looked up to see him smiling down at her. Her lips felt empty, stretched and swollen as he pulled her toward him. Her eyes fluttered shut and she kissed his lips with the taste of herself clinging to them. His hands found their way up her body and once again she felt his strong hands squeeze her breasts. She gasped as he began to run his thumb over her nipple, making her gasp again. The sound of her deep moans filled the empty space of the room, she felt his thumb on her clit as he began to run it over the opening to her pussy. He knew she was ready and he felt her tremble as she reached for him. He pulled her down gently toward him and she wrapped her legs around his waist as he entered her once again. Their lips kissed and then kissed and then kissed as their bodies tensed and tensed until they were ready to burst.</p> <p>His cock plunged into her hard as they moved together and then began to piston in and out. The only sound was their moans until their pleasure burst from them. He knew his climax was near and pulled out of her as he held himself on his arms, watching her as she lay against him. She was trembling beneath him and his cock began to get hard again as he ran his hand over her nipples. He knew their juices were running down toward his balls and he was sure he could see them glisten in the light of the room.</p> <p>As they lay there a few moments longer, kissing and rubbing each other with the softness of the sheets covered wall, he reached for her hand and guided it to his cock. He felt it slide into her hand gently. He smiled as he watched as her fingers closed around his cock as he lowered his lips to hers. As his tongue touched hers their mouths opened and they began to kiss passionately. His cock now deep inside of her, he began to thrust harder and faster as he felt her breasts and nipples rub against his chest. Their moans and cries filled the air and as they came together a powerful orgasm gripped them. All of their limbs were tingling from the experience and as he was close he pulled out of her and kissed her lips. She looked up at him and reached between his legs to take his cock in her hand. Moving her body so that their bodies were on top of each other they kissed and rubbed each others' body as he held her face and kissed her neck.</p> <p>They laid there for a few minutes and then he started to move a bit.
