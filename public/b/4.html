That old lady said this is the best thing for you,"</p> <p>"Well, I did try a bit of work on it some years ago," I laughed.</p> <p>"Really? I knew you were a guy, and you know why you are here," she asked me.</p> <p>"Well, maybe I can see why you had some good advice," I smiled and reached down to my pants.</p> <p>"Well, if you don't mind, why don't you go ahead and see my friend," I told her. I was a little embarrassed, and it was difficult, considering I had just had my last orgasm with my wife. She was still wearing her black miniskirt. I stood up, and she immediately started walking towards me. She was about 6' tall, and was very slim. Her tits looked amazing, with her short black hair which was cut into a pony tail, which gave her a very good "girls body".</p> <p>"I was hoping you would go for a swim today,"</p> <p>"I was going to just get started if I had anything else, no problem," I said.</p> <p>We started walking, not really talking about anything else, just just talking. I could not see why she would have any interest in having a swim this day, and her skirt was very short, but not so much that I could not tell from her boobs. I got a little hard just listening to her, and thinking about what we had just done.</p> <p>"Are you a little curious about my husband?" she asked.</p> <p>"Kind of, but not really. I just don't think I could tell," I said. She walked over and knelt in front of me. I could feel the air on my crotch, she knew instantly. I put my hand on her head and she started to stroke my cock.</p> <p>"So, why did you stop, but tell me, how does it feel to have someone else's tongue licking your cock?" she asked me.</p> <p>"It kind of turned me on, but not the same as you."</p> <p>"But I could tell you liked it, and that you love being touched by other men," she said slowly. I had not felt this way about another man. I could feel her fingers running along the head of my cock, just over and around it.</p> <p>"I really do, but it gets hard to tell. At first you just let me show you some things, but it gets easier to tell you after a while," I told her. Maybe the shock was a bit of a shock. I thought I was going to lose it then.</p> <p>"I think that I need some help to tell you something," she asked me. As I was thinking about it, she leaned forward and took the head of my cock in her mouth. It wasn't an erotic situation, but it was quite a pleasure. I just let her suck on the head of my cock for a few minutes. Then she pushed it away, and said, "You did say this was the best thing for you. Would you mind, or if I just lie down, I think it was time for me to rest," she said very bluntly. I did it, just so I could tell how much it was turning me on, but I didn't see her lying down, or putting her pussy lips on my cock. It just turned me on more.</p> <p>"Well. How do I tell you what you really want?" she asked me. Before I could answer she stood up and took both hands and wrapped her arms around me and kissed me fully on the mouth. It felt very sexy, and almost like she was still drunk from our last make out session. As I put my arms around her, she kept pressing her body against mine, and started pressing me backwards to lay down. I didn't want to move, and didn't want to kiss her like I wanted to fuck her, but I couldn't. I let her slide down so she would be on top, and kissed her on the cheek, but she didn't stop me. I felt her soft breasts against my chest and her stomach pressing up against my cock. It was very different than when I was with my wife. It felt like she wanted it so bad. My hands moved down to her ass, and started to massage the flesh all around it.</p> <p>She slowly moved herself around, putting one leg on either side of me. I felt her hot breath over my face, and heard her whisper to me, "You look so wonderful lying there, I just need to take this slow. You are so beautiful."</p> <p>I felt her fingers gently massage the cheeks of my ass, and I closed my eyes. "Just relax and let me take you," she whispered. Again her fingers started to work on my ass, then slid down to my balls and started to rub themâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
