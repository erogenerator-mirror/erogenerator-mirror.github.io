I hesitated a moment, but then, without protest, I quickly unzipped my dress, pulled down my panties, removed my bra and stepped out of my panties. Mr. Williams handed me a box, and then said, "There you go, now take it and set it on the table, and leave it there."</p> <p>I opened the box, and found it was empty! How in the world did Miss Humbert know I was holding a box of my clothes? Mr. Williams walked away. I looked around for more of my clothes, but they were missing!</p> <p>"I don't own you, do you understand?" Mr. Williams said loudly as he walked back to his room with another box.</p> <p>I stood back in shock, and then I knew what Mr. Williams meant! My father wanted me to have all my clothes! I looked again. Was there something wrong with me? I was naked! My daddy was going to give me all my clothes! My face blushed. "I've gone shopping today, and I bought a few things. There you go, my car is yours to carry all day! But I don't own you, do you understand?" With that, Mr. Williams closed his door and left the room while I ran to my bedroom and changed into my clothes. I put on my school uniform, a short skirt, and an almost see through blouse. In the bedroom, I looked all over the dresser for my father's clothes. I found my father's clothes in its plain yellow trash bag (yes, I know, but he is a boy!) I hurried back to my room, and threw my clothes on the floor. I sat down in front of my dresser and put them there.</p> <p>I took my shoes all the time, because I had little time to myself, and it was going to be bad. I was going to be stuck with Mr. Williams, no use trying to leave things like this behind, and no use going home and looking at him. The whole situation was going to kill me! I had to go out as soon as he was done with me. I would call down on him! I looked at my phone - I looked at my dad's phone - and there was a message. The message said, "Come visit me tomorrow, come by every Sunday."</p> <p>I looked at the phone, it was my daddy! I had just gone through the worst day of my life! I started to pick up my panties, and then I stopped. I looked at the panties - I thought they were dirty! Yes, I had just cum, but they were full of sperm! I couldn't just throw them out! I put the panties in the trash bag, and closed it back up. It took several seconds for everything to settle down. "Yes, yes of course I do," Mr. Williams said, "come to see me tomorrow. I have been away for the evening, and I'll see you tomorrow."</p> <p>I rushed to the door as he called out. "Oh, I didn't mean to take your panties!" I said, "I just forgot, you'll see me tomorrow!" He didn't respond, and the phone went dead. I jumped all over myself to go in his room, but I couldn't move! I was naked, and I didn't know what to do! I ran to my bed, grabbed a turtleneck from the closet and threw it on. I sat on my bed for a moment and tried to calm myself, to stop thinking, but the turtleneck hurt! I picked it up, and looked it over, and realized I was dressed as I had left my clothes behind. Could he have seen me? What would he want if he caught me? I sat there a few moments, in my turtleneck, until I felt something on my leg. I pulled my feet up. I looked at it, and saw that there was no panties in it! I had dropped everything! I sat there a moment, trying to calm my mind. I looked under the turtleneck, and pulled it up off the floor, and out the front. It was my father! I opened the front, and it was my daddy! I started to cry, and I couldn't take anymore. I looked at my father's clothes. Oh, no! There was no panties! Where did they come from? What was I supposed to do? Did what Mr. Williams was saying mean anything to my life? I looked at my dresser, and there was my panties, and I went back to bed!</p> <p>When I woke up the next morning, I saw a turtleneck on the floor. I looked in the mirror. What would my dad say! I grabbed my turtleneck and put it on, but the turtleneck felt weird on meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
