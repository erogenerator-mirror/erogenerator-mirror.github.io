"And you better fuck him when this is a regular occurrence, because he has got a whole new set of expectations," I could hear the nervous little girl voice that often accompanied these talks.</p> <p>That was what I would have done had I not been in that situation. Now it was time for just a bit of a break for me and I had to have a quick word with my boyfriend.</p> <p>As this scenario went through my head, I couldn't really think of what to say. This whole scene was way too much for me to handle. So I decided to play it by ear and to go back to talking to my boyfriend.</p> <p>"I'm just waiting for your friend up stairs," I said as I stepped off the bus and turned towards the bus station. "I want to get this over with quickly and then maybe get on with a new relationship that just happens."</p> <p>"Oh," she said as she came back and sat down, "and you are going to wait for me?"</p> <p>As I left the bus, she grabbed my arm and pulled me closer into her. "I'm going to take a quick shower, and you can wait in front, too," she said, "I'm going to meet you in the lobby in just a minute," as she winked at me and left the bus.</p> <p>In a few minutes later, there was my boyfriend walking down the sidewalk towards us with her hand firmly pressed into my shorts. He stopped just before me and stared with interest at my breasts, even though I couldn't understand his reaction. I had to look away to keep from revealing my naked breasts to him.</p> <p>"You look like someone who has got to use a washcloth in the rain," he told me.</p> <p>"Yeah," I replied, "but I'm not really used to that."</p> <p>"You know, you always have got to wear something really sexy," he said, and I blushed a little more than usual.</p> <p>He took the washcloth that had fallen off of her left breast just as we got to the lobby. She told me to take my time and to let him take a good look at my body. I started by taking off my clothes.</p> <p>When I was done, I reached down into the pockets of my shorts and pulled out my panties. I was trying to think up a pretty lame plan to get him to take my panties off, but it was futile. He followed my lead, and I got him to stand right next to me.</p> <p>By now, I was completely naked from the waist down and he could clearly see the outline of my trimmed landing strip of pubic hair. He took my hand and pulled me along as the elevator bell began to ring once again.</p> <p>I stepped out of both my shorts, which I had slipped on as I put my hands on my knees, and walked towards the elevator, my breasts swaying with each step.</p> <p>We rode a few floors before the door opened. "Oh, that's an amazing experience," was all I could get out to him, when the elevator door shut and he pulled me towards him and kissed me.</p> <p>Then he turned me around to face him but I was still sitting on the lobby floor. By now, we had our arms around each other. I pushed him off of my body and said "No!" as he reached down and pulled me back down onto the floor. We kissed each other fiercely as we felt the elevator begin to slow. Thankfully, our knees were rubbing together in time to our kisses. I could feel his erection through his pants.</p> <p>He broke first. "Wow, that was nice," he said, with a grin, and he released me. He pulled one of the buttons on my shirt aside and took his shirt off. He pulled my shirt up over my tits and off, leaving me naked on the floor. Then he kissed me again.</p> <p>He pulled me up to him and pressed me down on the rug directly under the coffee table. He lifted my legs up over his shoulders and started to lower himself into me, taking his time and not going fast. He stopped just when he was completely inside me and was holding still inside me.</p> <p>He kissed his way up to my neck and up to my ear. He gently kissed between my ear and neck as he whispered to me, "I love you, sweet one, and I'm so sorry for this whole thing but I can't take it anymore."</p> <p>He kissed the nape of my neck and then moved to my mouth for I couldn't tell just how long they kissed. As soon as he started to move his hips, his penis slipped out of my pussy and he lowered me onto the rug and began to fuck me.</p> <p>He stopped abruptly as if heâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
