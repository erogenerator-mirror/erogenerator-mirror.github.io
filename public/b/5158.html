He liked it when she would reach for something and run her fingers through or even brush his face. He loved what he saw. They didn’t say a word to each other but they talked about it. They both liked it when they talked about it and talked about it. She felt it when he did or said her name whenever they talked about sex. He just listened to her as she talked about it in a way and he knew it from doing to and talking to her.</p> <p>He had her stand before him and she wanted to look into his eyes. She knew they could look into each other’s eyes and she loved how he looked into them. She told him how much she enjoyed her new relationship with him, but he wouldn’t let her. She would have to tell him. He told her he would never do anything else with her, that she had to tell him. She told him how the sex with him was a new thing.</p> <p>She smiled at him and said, “This is getting to be more than a two months wait.”</p> <p>He said, “Yes it is.”</p> <p>It was almost noon, and he was looking forward to getting home but first he had to put some distance between them and get home. He said, “I have a reservation.”</p> <p>She said, “Are you sure?”</p> <p>He had to put distance between them and it made a difference. As he approached her, she just stared at him with those big brown eyes and he couldn’t contain how much he wanted her. She seemed almost hypnotized and as he approached she asked, “Would you please show me where to eat?”</p> <p>He gave her a knowing smile and said, “Are we in private?”</p> <p>She looked at his crotch and he was hard. She reached into his shorts and got some of her wetness that was leaking across the material. She pulled a finger to her lips and sucked it. He took in a sharp breath as her finger touched his cock. She looked up at him and smiled and said, “Take your clothes off.”</p> <p>He undid his belt and his pants and they dropped to the floor. She turned around and he saw her perfect body. She had small breasts with large nipples that poked out at almost a 36C cup which she had pierced. Her neatly trimmed bush and her pussy hair were perfect.</p> <p>He reached for her to help her put her things away and they stood on the bed together. He pulled her close and felt her breasts with his hand. Her skin was so smooth and soft. He leaned down and put his lips on hers, sliding his tongue into her mouth. Her kiss surprised him so much but he loved the feel of her lips on his and that she wanted to taste her own taste on his mouth.</p> <p>They kissed for a long time and as he slid his hand down between them feeling her wetness and knowing it was his. He took her hand and put it on his stiff cock. She had a dreamy look on her face so that her eyes were looking at it from all angles. He loved how she stroked him while they kissed. She told him how bad she wanted to taste what she had and he would take her. He was sure there would be many times when she would be so nasty with him but right now she had nothing but pleasure and desire. He couldn’t wait. Their kiss was hot and moist but just as he put his hand to her pubic hair and she pushed down on his hand and he thought she would have a huge orgasm just from that. She kept pushing on his hand and he thought he was going to go crazy. Finally her body started to tense and she opened one eye and asked, “Can I come now?”</p> <p>He smiled and kissed her and he knew he loved her. She loved him and they would spend quite a while in those terms. He just nodded in agreement and they were both too caught up and wanting one of the most sexual things they could have. With her on top of him she felt the bed moving and she looked on. There were two people on the bed and she could hear the moans of ecstasy.</p> <p>She started to move in rhythm slowly and she felt her body heat up along with the heat between them. She was going to let him make her come. That’s what she wanted and with both of them she wanted to do just that. She wanted to touch and feel his large hard cock as he pumped his hips up so that she could feel his cock inside her. He could feel his cock move inside her and his hand started to caress her breasts which were swollen and ready. Her hand came—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
