I can't have words," she cooed.</p> <p>There was nothing else that needed to be said. I pulled up my trousers but before I could pull them up and button up, she moved her head again to my dick she said, "I wanted to do this and make it really you. I love it, and I want your cum inside me, I always wanted you to lick and suck it. It looks so fucking big and hot in your boxers."</p> <p>This was all too much. I was about to come. When her mouth pulled back away from me I pulled my jeans on, and looked at her in the mirror; it was a moment that would forever change our friendship. She just turned and smiled and winked at me. Her tits were so small. I guess in the right size of tits, and her ass wasn't that round.</p> <p>I walked out the door and into my car. "I'll see you again!" she called to me.</p> <p>I drove home in a fog of lust, and couldn't find my way home. "Let's do it together." I said to myself.</p> <p>As she walked up on the driveway, she looked fantastic. She had on the shortest mini skirt and an unbuttoned top that looked the same as all of my pictures in my drawer. The top didn't open the rest of the way from where it was but she had to know it's purpose. She got onto her front porch not too fast to look for it. She could see what my eyes were and what I'm sure was my heart pounding. She stepped through the door and turned to face me. "Is this ok?"</p> <p>"Go now," I said.</p> <p>"No, I have to get ready for work and I'll be right out."</p> <p>"I'll see you later," I said and headed in.</p> <p>I grabbed my car keys and went inside. It seemed a little odd that she was home, but I didn't have a clue as to why she had invited me in. She walked into the living room and sat next to me. As I sat down on one side of her she removed the long sleeve shirt and her bra was exposed. She put her hand on my leg and squeezed it through my jeans.</p> <p>"Take a seat," I said.</p> <p>We sat there for a moment until she put her arms around me and pulled me down for a kiss. I ran my hands through her long wet hair as she made out with me. She got up and removed her top and kissed me. "Go ahead and go to work," I said. It was the most honest of comments I could make. She kissed me again and left me with my cock aching, when she locked the front door.</p> <p>I went to work. The first couple of pages came in just about as often as the rest. I spent hours on the pages when my mind was in turmoil from the sexual tension between us. As I typed the same thing over and over I thought about what she had said in our previous email and how her body had responded. It was hard to take the pressure off her as my fantasies of kissing and touching and tasting her all over my body were growing stronger and stronger.</p> <p>As I sent my new email address to her, all the sexual tension seemed to be gone. She was still mine and I just wanted to make love to her. We were the "good guys." We were the good, in my world. I had known her for about 3 months and she was the perfect friend so far.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Thank you so very much, my friend.</p> <p>All characters are above the age of 18.</p> <p>My name is Chris. I am of Indian heritage. I am 24 years old and live in the suburbs of South London in a small neighborhood that consists of three houses, one for the older residents, one for the young, three for the young people, and all five are located about ten miles from my home right now.</p> <p>This is the story of my first relationship with my girlfriend as the story progresses.</p> <p>She met me at a party the other night and we spent the rest of the evening together. We started kissing and she was so intoxicated she never took her clothes off. I didn't feel guilty because I was happy and she made me feel at home. I kept my hands on her and helped her undress. We didn't use any of our old clothes, just her skirt and her panties. All the while, she was caressing the parts of herself that were exposed to me. I didn't touch her breasts; she just touched them and rubbed them. It felt so good.
