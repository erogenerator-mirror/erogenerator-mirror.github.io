She had a black ribbon around her neck, and her white teeth glowed brightly in the twilight. Her skin was flawless, and his sister's black string bikini revealed the curves of her breasts; she looked like some exotic fruit. Her dark brown hair was fanned out above her head, and her breasts pressed against the fabric. She had long eyelashes, and her face was made up with delicate make-up; her long silky hair was held tightly in place by a tight-fitting black string.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, honey," he told her, taking the picture with shaking hands, "I thought we were gonna have to share it."</p> <p>"Don't bother with that, honey," she purred, smiling up, "It's nothing. It's the most erotic thing anyone has ever seen, and I don't care how it looks. I feel like a sex goddess right now."</p> <p>"There have been things I've been aching for," he said, "I just can't think what to do," he went on, "just go out and have an amazing time. If I can go through with this, I know I'll never be able to go home without it."</p> <p>She was already half-way to her room with the lights off, and when he walked in the front door the second time he thought he'd lost it. There he found her lying on her bed, covered face down with a sheet so tight around her belly that her breasts were pushed up into an enticing position. He couldn't resist the temptation to lift the sheet off her; she looked incredibly sexy in that skimpy bikini. As he stood there, breathing heavily, he looked down at himself. He hadn't really been expecting anything like this of all people, let alone her. He had hoped she wouldn't feel so at ease, so sexy that a casual touch made her feel all hot and slutty and wild. The look on her face caused him to feel almost as if he should throw the sheet off, but she lay there, looking at him, and for a long moment looked at him.</p> <p>She didn't want him to take it off; she wanted to feel this man who was just as aroused as she was. He started feeling a bit strange. He felt his groin tighten, the tent in his shorts was very obvious. Was he really going to do this for her? He felt a little uncomfortable but couldn't get his head around the fact that he might just do it for the sake of having sex, he wasn't sure he knew if it was actually going to happen. He decided to take the step up a bit and reached for the bottom of the sheet. He felt a strong urge to just lift the sheet up and start undressing her. Even though he was thinking of doing it right, he couldn't really be sure if this was really a good idea or not. But, he didn't need to worry, she was the one making the decision.</p> <p>Her body seemed to be doing the right thing; her breasts moved up and down as she moaned and rolled onto her side. He kept feeling more of the urge to just pull up the sheet, but his hands remained on her, and when he lifted her arm she groaned out and lay her head back against the pillowed end of the bed. He felt more than a little awkward about it, but his erection was pushing all the way up his shorts as his heart jumped into his throat. It had been three months since the start of their relationship, and now it was time to give her that relief. He slowly let her arm go; she looked up at him, and with a big grin, grabbed his hand and put it on her breast. He was surprised, but was able to wrap his finger round the hard bud. He watched as he made circular movements along her breast, moving his finger slowly back and forth while he played with her. She closed her eyes and murmured, "It feels so good when you touch me like that," before he slid further down into the crevice between her breasts.</p> <p>"Are you touching your pussy right now?" he asked with a raised eyebrow.</p> <p>She rolled over on the bed, and she looked so good lying there. He didn't hesitate to pull his shorts down and move himself over so he could be comfortable. She turned over to watch him, and he noticed right away that she was staring at his erection. She was still in her pajamas and she was right up against his leg; she looked so incredibly sexy, and his mouth watered every time he saw her face. He started taking off his shirt when she said, "Come on," and pulled him onto the bed with herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
