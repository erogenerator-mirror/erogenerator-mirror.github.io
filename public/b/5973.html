Just because I do this once in a while, it doesn't mean that you are now. It never means if you just go back to how things used to be.</p> <p>I went to her as quickly as I could, trying to get some light comfort and a warm feeling back in my chest.</p> <p>"Hey honey!" she said quietly, "It was your fault that I had to let you know that I have been coming back to you. You are a good man, and I always will be, and it was for the best if you accept it." I didn't say anything. Why not? I thought, the last time I saw her I was just fine.</p> <p>"Yeah." I said, and she kissed me, but it lasted a lot. It never worked with her, even in the heat of the moment. Just because she thought I loved her made me a bit more comfortable, but when it was only me, and in this light, I saw her as a different kind than a good loving person.</p> <p>It wasn't like her, it wouldn't have happened as it was, not when we knew and worked things from what was supposed to happen.</p> <p>"I should probably get going. I need a shower." She said, taking the sheets.</p> <p>"Uh, ok." I said, a little self-conscious.</p> <p>She had just turned around and was standing by the tub when I finished getting ready. I heard the water start up in the bathroom and the bathroom door open a little. The steam poured out from the shower and into the room just beyond. I couldn't help myself and looked down at her. She wasn't wearing a towel anymore, the towel had been gone. Her tits, as I had just noticed were almost bursting out, and her dark nipples were hard against her white tank. When she saw all that I saw, she jumped in the shower, running the shower head over her entire body, getting a nice, deep scrub from her neck down to her feet. I sat down at the breakfast bar. She seemed to hurry to her room to dress before getting dressed. She was still in her robe, sitting down on the table, the robe falling open just enough that it showed a hint of her tits, and she had no shirt on. I didn't have any clothes on.</p> <p>She jumped up to grab her robe, and then the bathroom door closed. That's all I could see. I had my phone out, but I couldn't picture her in the bathroom with nothing on. She turned around and was standing at the counter with her back to the doorway. The shower water drips off her body like a waterfall. I don't think she had on any panties. I can't even see her skin. I am almost at her pussy. I just know she was going to fuck me, but maybe I'll just go down on myself, since that's what I do.</p> <p>I didn't have much time to think about it. My prick was about to explode. She was going to be my bitch, and she saw all the same. She jumped at my side and hugged me again. That's all I could do. I had to cum to make myself cum. I thought I was going to cry, or fall to the floor. She didn't have to tell me to "cum" twice. She ran her mouth over my forehead like a puppy. I know I could have stopped, and then I didn't either. I knew if I could stop right then I would have shot my jiz down her throat, but that's different, because with all of the orgasms and orgasms and orgasms of the past two days...I just let it happen.</p> <p>"Oh, honey." I said, and she smiled and kissed me again.</p> <p>After drying off, I put my clothes back in my closet and found some jeans and a hoodie. I was going to take another shower. I heard the water shut off. I could have cum again in one of the next two days, if I had just been horny. Just like she had never cum. I opened the medicine cabinet, took out some of her medicine, and walked out to the tub. She was still standing there, not saying a word. I took a couple of minutes to get out of the shower and get another towel, going back to my room for my clothes. I took them with me back to her.</p> <p>She didn't say anything. She took off her robe. Her naked body was on display for me, her smallish breasts looked so much like they were going to burst out of her chest as she got out of the shower. Her nipples were hard, and her little patch above her mons was wet. Her lips, which I could barely see from the open bathroom doorâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
