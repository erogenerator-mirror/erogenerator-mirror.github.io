I asked. "I can't go on this journey as soon as I can."</p> <p>"No, but you're going to have to," she replied, moving her legs to open her thighs a little more.</p> <p>"I don't see what difference does it make?" I countered. "She's a good girl."</p> <p>"I'm an honest virgin, and I'll not be another of her high school sweethearts," she said. "So just tell me; do you want to have a baby?"</p> <p>"Yes," I responded. "I want to have a baby with you."</p> <p>"I'm sure you're sure," she said. "Can you talk me into it?"</p> <p>"I'll have to," I replied. "We're going to do it."</p> <p>"Just don't get me pregnant," she said.</p> <p>"You're the one who said you wanted to have sex with a guy," I reminded her.</p> <p>"I said 'no.' I have no intention of having children," she replied. I was about to agree to her offer when she leaned on her elbows and faced me, and kissed me lightly on the mouth. The heat of our body pressing together like that was heavenly. I could feel her nipples harden through the thin material of her top. She looked down at herself and saw that the buttons of her top were a little undone. She pulled them back up to hold them as she leaned back, exposing herself.</p> <p>I felt as if I were in a dream. "This has never happened before," I whispered. "This is different."</p> <p>"You're still my hero," she replied. "This is real. I've had sex, but I never get to touch another woman."</p> <p>We kissed again and undid another button to the side. Her hips were moving, pressing against my lower abdomen.</p> <p>"No," she laughed. "It's just this, I'm afraid we'll lose the baby. But I'll let you do this anytime you want."</p> <p>I started to undo the last of the buttons, when she grabbed my wrist. "Wait," she said. "I want it to be for you."</p> <p>Her tone changed as she added, "Let me help you."</p> <p>She pulled my top off, revealing my chest. I was flat on my back with my hands supporting me like a baby. Her eyes moved slowly over me as her eyes locked on my nipples. She ran her fingers over them, then pulled the nipples and pulled upward. The contrast between those two beautiful mounds made me shiver. Finally, I was standing completely naked in front of her. She quickly stripped and had me lay on the bed. I could see her face between my legs, with her head leaning on her right elbow. Her hands held my arms down just above my shoulder blades. Then, her mouth descended into my pussy, licking it just a little bit. I started to arch my hips upward into her face.</p> <p>"Oh no, not with your cock in me," I protested.</p> <p>"Just stay like that and just relax, and you'll only be doing it for me," she said.</p> <p>"My pussy is not for you," I moaned. It's for you," she said, pressing her body just a little bit closer to mine.</p> <p>"You're really wet," she said. "If I would have known what to do it would have saved all of this trouble." Her tongue moved quickly over my clit. "Oh God, it tastes so good," I said.</p> <p>Her tongue moved around just a touch, and I had to close my eyes and moan in excitement. She licked it, then moved to my opening. Her fingers rubbed it for a while, then entered me quickly, and pushed in further, as if to increase the pleasure I could feel from her. The feelings were amazing, but I couldn't help but notice the wetness I was causing on her leg as she worked her tongue over it.</p> <p>I felt my legs starting to shake, she quickly withdrew her face from my pussy. "Don't look so happy," I begged.</p> <p>She didn't. She knelt next to me on the bed, her left leg out straight and her hands resting on my thighs. She kissed my legs, running her tongue down the length of my thigh. She could take her time. She had me on edge now. Her lips moved closer to my pussy, and she put them on my thighs and parted them as she kissed the inside of my thigh. A tremor ran through my body. She brought her lips up to my pussy, and slowly put them on my outer lips. That excited me even more. She continued to teaseâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
