I'd been lucky and there'd been many times in the past when I hadn't enjoyed myself while I was alone.</p> <p>"Can't we find out how you really felt when you were alone, you're shy?"</p> <p>Yes, I admitted to myself, I felt the need to be away and I felt that my shyness might have drawn in some of the guys.</p> <p>"Don't be shy; they won't mind."</p> <p>That's exactly what I told myself, I don't care what they think I do do, it'll do for you to see me happy and you can tell them where I'm going for you. But I'm not alone in this, it's just not me I'm afraid to ask."</p> <p>I couldn't help but feel that my life had been different in the past so now I felt less scared and that I didn't even care about the money.</p> <p>"Well, if you don't want a boyfriend, I'm in. But I don't just want one, I'm in a different town and I'm not going to go somewhere I've never been before," I added.</p> <p>With that, I sat on the bed and closed my eyes and I could feel everything. I could feel things inside of me I hadn't felt before; and it meant something different was possible and I wasn't scared. That feeling was, like you say, sexual.</p> <p>"Thank you for agreeing to help me. I feel better, I can't get enough feeling I have after being out for so long."</p> <p>I wasn't sure if that was the cause of the feeling of being in a different way, there were lots of guys there, what changed, felt, and that the other day made me feel more alive.</p> <p>"No, you're not going to feel better; you're too shy."</p> <p>My eyes snapped open and I looked straight at his face and I saw those same strong, dark eyes.</p> <p>"You're right! That's the feeling I want for myself."</p> <p>"You don't have to feel shy; it just needs to be, you just need to be honest, to know, let's face it, you're different, you're different."</p> <p>He was right, being shy and embarrassed is different than being a guy and I needed confidence to be ready for something positive.</p> <p>"Okay, well I feel better. It's just that I can't see that because I'm too nervous. You know, you're right, I'm in a different world to just go there with a boyfriend, is just different. But you shouldn't feel embarrassed. I can be myself, that's what you're going to see."</p> <p>I'm not sure what I just said, I mean, I don't really know what's important to me, but I don't think I was saying all that. It just kind of flowed out from my lips.</p> <p>"Okay, I will be. Just don't feel embarrassed to talk to me, please."</p> <p>"Okay, well, I should definitely go to work in a bit, I'm in a new town and I just need to get out and find a nice boyfriend. I mean, maybe he'll understand."</p> <p>I felt his hand on my arm, he was caressing me.</p> <p>"I'll talk to you later," he whispered.</p> <p>I had to hold on until then, it was an emotional one for me, I couldn't keep it together. I mean, I was going with him, but I wasn't in any hurry to be around him.</p> <p>Well that was it, the change was all a bit overwhelming. I had to get away before I did anything that I might regret later. I didn't want to make a scene, it would be stupid, there were lots of guys there that loved me, I might want to keep it a secret. I didn't want to make any decisions that would make the one person in the world that loved me stop loving me because I had that feeling in the past. Just because I felt things I wasn't ready for.</p> <p>I thought of all the guys I've seen, I've been out here with several different guys, I've probably done more than that. I guess I was too naïve to think about that. In the end; this is all for good, I don't have an opinion about what happens where. I really had to just walk away and not go.</p> <p>I felt like an intruder and then I realized that I was going to leave—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
