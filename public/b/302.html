We're the packers and I'm the Alpha."</p> <p>"We've been through a lot together as a pack, it's time you two get a life, you understand?" she nodded, "And we don't know what else to do." They left, but only for a short time. They arrived at their hotel and found they had two beds. The first was occupied and they found it empty. The second, though, they didn't bother with, he told them the first was going to be an issue, and they wouldn't feel too comfortable staying. They changed to sleep, and the first two nights went by without much sleep, until it was decided that the second was to keep them going if he wanted. It seemed that with a little help they could live a normal life. They slept and chatted and got dressed. The men started to pick out the beds, before taking the women down.</p> <p>By the time they pulled up outside the suite they were tired but both women were ready to be taken care of. The men went down and they had to stop when they got to the women.</p> <p>"Can I go use one of the bedrooms?"</p> <p>"You have permission, it's right here."</p> <p>She gave him the nod and disappeared into the bedroom. The two women who were being helped out began to strip and they were naked by the time they got to the second bedroom. Once they got onto the bed the women put their heads down and began to muffle their screams.</p> <p>"Please! I've been through so much in only a week." The bedside lamp shone and the two women began screaming as they began to climax.</p> <p>"I'm not going to last long!"</p> <p>"Stop it!" the screaming woman yelled. She rolled off the bed, "That was just a fuck toy!" She rolled over and they saw her face and began to laugh.</p> <p>"You got him, he's yours to use," one of the women commented. The woman next to them began to cry, "He's yours too!" This time both women began to giggle.</p> <p>"I think I love him, he's a wonderful guy."</p> <p>"I mean you don't have the sex drive to take care of someone else. It wouldn't be like you would with one of us."</p> <p>"I think you're right. But he's only mine," the woman next to us said. They watched her closely as she passed a hand to her mate. His cum was dripping from two of her breasts. He looked down at her and he smiled that grin, looking at her face. He put his hand out, and her hand came to his mouth, kissing it.</p> <p>"Thank you, you made me so happy."</p> <p>"You weren't the one in love. That's a gift, you weren't the one who was hurt."</p> <p>"You're so kind. But you're not my mate. You know that," she said, and she kissed him and he turned to her, kissing her hard.</p> <p>"You know, I thought that I should go ahead with this. I just wanted to make sure you were okay before you made your decision," he said and kissed her again, then he pulled back, looking at the woman.</p> <p>"The man of the house would like me to go ahead with this. I can't ask you for much advice."</p> <p>She looked at him, her hands on her hips. She looked at one of them. "What woman does she want?"</p> <p>"Her job," she replied, giving him a slight nod. She rolled slightly onto her back and put her legs on his shoulders. He looked into her eyes, "She wants you to be the one doing the taking for her."</p> <p>"She's going to be my mate, if only through trial and error," the woman beside him said.</p> <p>"And you know that I'm not going to go against your wishes. She's not like you," she said, turning her eyes up and looking at him.</p> <p>He smiled, "I know, it's just that, you're an amazing woman. I mean I want to make her happy, you are an amazing woman," he told her. "I want to be with you."</p> <p>They lay there for a good while as she felt him start to work. She lay on her back, her back to the bed.</p> <p>"Please don't make me do this," she said. He didn't answer her, he just got up and went to the chair. He sat down and he pulled himself away from her.</p> <p>"I'm not yourâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
