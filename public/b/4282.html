"Can you bring your bag around?"</p> <p>"Sure Daddy, let's go."</p> <p>Mason led the two girls out on the porch, and he noticed the girls' eyes. They smiled at him, as he grabbed his bags and followed us by the porch steps. The girls were laughing and talking, as they headed to the front door. Before we got to the front door, Mason grabbed Sara's hand and practically dragged her away saying, "Let's go." He turned and looked at me with a raised eyebrow. "Where'd you learn to do this, Daddy?"</p> <p>"Just a little... from some of my own experience, Mom," I teased, "But that's only the start."</p> <p>Mason just chuckled, and we followed him up the wooden staircase that had turned into the garage. We were right next to the large living room, as it had a full basement, with a TV and bookcase, and several old boxes. It was just the place we needed to be in our new life.</p> <p>"My God, we're in Mom's dungeon," I said aloud, just as Sara asked "Can you see anything?"</p> <p>Mason just chuckled, and said, "Yes, there's a good place."</p> <p>Mason stopped, as he looked at me and asked, "Do you think that's the basement? My God it must be scary."</p> <p>I looked at him as I shook my head. "I don't think so, Daddy, this is just the beginning," I said with a grin. "My friends have their own dungeon, when I get up."</p> <p>We continued walking toward the house. We had turned onto the porch, and were at the door, and Mason stopped. "Mason? Can I call you Daddy?"</p> <p>Mason was standing at the door, leaning against the wall with a small smile on his face. He looked at me and said, "Yes, baby, call me Daddy." He turned and walked back toward me, and I was afraid he was leaving, but I was too far gone to worry about that. I walked on in a daze, as the door opened and there were two people in the house.</p> <p>As they walked in, there eyes seemed to be glued to me as my Daddy entered the living room and looked at me from time to time. He looked me over from head to toe, as he smiled and said, "Hello you, I'm Mason. I see you're upstairs."</p> <p>"Hi, Daddy," I said, blushing as I continued to stand by the far wall. "I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing, but it's just going to make things more exciting."</p> <p>Mason, looked me over carefully and said, "I don't think we'd want to have things in such a dungeon that they'd be too exciting to handle."</p> <p>I looked up at him, smiled nervously, and said, "Mason, I just want to be with you all day tomorrow...." I looked around at people watching us, a million questions racing through my mind. Would I be able to do this? I knew we had just started, and could wait for that first night before making our plan. I didn't plan on being able to come at all. My heart dropped at the thought.</p> <p>"Well, you can't, can you?" Mason asked, as he looked at what I was standing near. He looked at her face as she stood there looking him up and down. She smiled as she looked at our smiles before taking a step forward. "Let's get you showered, and then we can leave, won't you?"</p> <p>Mason followed her into the shower stall, and we both watched her as she took off her clothes, her eyes looking at me from time to time as she did. Once she was completely nude, she stepped into the shower, and I followed. I saw her face, and that look before she looked at Mason. She smiled at me as she looked at Mason. "Mason, do you remember the way you were looking at Sara, when you saw us having sex?" I nodded as I reached in and stroked her cheek with my finger. She smiled as she smiled at me. "And, you saw me, when you looked at Sara as you were having sex with Mom."</p> <p>Mason chuckled as he looked at my hand, and said, "I remembered you looking at me, when you saw Sara watching us."</p> <p>I smiled as I looked at him. "I don't see you looking at her. Do you want to do something?"</p> <p>Mason looked over at me and replied, "I'll be right there. I don't want to miss an opportunity, so let's get started."</p> <p>Mâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
