I insisted.</p> <p>Kate was blushing a little. "Because, I want to make something special for you."</p> <p>"Oh," I smiled and stepped towards her. "I understand."</p> <p>Kate giggled and stepped towards me. She had her arms around my neck. She had her legs around my waist as we had been walking. I could feel her legs on mine and her breasts press into my back.</p> <p>"Thank you!" She gushed as she held me and we walked down the street and up towards the building. After that, we headed inside. "You can come with the first door on the right," Kate said.</p> <p>"I'll just follow you, I'm so excited," I said. "So excited that I feel like we're going to take off this shirt!"</p> <p>Kate laughed. "No way, you're going to have to catch me before that!" She said as she pressed her lips against mine.</p> <p>"But, I will," I said with a laugh. We turned one corner of the hotel, and Kate walked me along the hallway. "Just think of all this clothing you're going to buy next time, and..." I stepped in to a large room with a king-size flat bed. Kate was already undressing as we entered the room. She went quickly to her dressing room. She came right back to the bed.</p> <p>"What are you wearing?" I asked. "It looks like...like an...Oh, crap!"</p> <p>Kate had already turned around in bed. Her dress was a red tank top. The front was held in place by spaghetti straps. Her breasts were spilling over the neckline of the top. The top had dark little straps that went down her cleavage. The top scooped deeply from both sides of her neck to the first third of an inch!</p> <p>I had caught myself staring a little before. "A friend of mine made me some...surprising stuff in Japan! It's...like a little...secret, okay?" Kate's eyes were staring me directly into my eyes.</p> <p>"That's okay, it was really meant that you'd have these, I bought them for you," Kate said with a giggle.</p> <p>Kate slowly reached under her sweater. She slid it down her arms, causing a white, lacy bra. Her hands went down to her breasts. Her small breasts were firm and sat high on her chest. When she started to pull her bra down, the straps slipped off her shoulders.</p> <p>Kate was taking her time to unhook her bra and it fell to the floor next to her dress. I took in the beautiful sight of her bra and nipples. I wanted to caress them myself, to suckle on them and worship them with my lips.</p> <p>But, the last thing that I wanted to do was ruin these underwear.</p> <p>"Here," Kate said as she unbuttoned her jeans, "here." She slipped the jeans down her hips and off her feet. Now she sat on the bed facing me.</p> <p>Kate took off her panties and tossed them out the window. She was completely shaved! I was speechless.</p> <p>"Well, you see," Kate said with a small tone of disbelief, "I can't stop looking at you!"</p> <p>This is one thing about Kate I hadn't considered. The way she moved, the look in her eyes, the way her body was shaking with excitement, her head turned away the whole time, the look in her eyes was almost hypnotic.</p> <p>"Come on, take me to bed, but get your clothes off. I want to see you."</p> <p>I knew that I needed to have Kate inside of me right then, inside of my body as much as she did. "Oh, come on," I said, reaching for her.</p> <p>"Not here! Not now, you won't see anything."</p> <p>But I had no intentions of not leaving the bed, so I slid the gown off and let her see it. Her eyes were glistening as she took in the sight of the white satin.</p> <p>"Wow," she breathed as she looked up into my eyes, "This is amazing!"</p> <p>I reached for her hand and pulled her close.</p> <p>I started to undress. I was taking off my shirt. I wanted her to touch me, to see if I was really as sexy as she told me to be. I wanted to tell her how pretty and beautiful she was, how perfect her soft hair was on the inside of her mouth, how pretty her eyes looked, and how much she loved to kiss and lick.</p> <p>But, I felt Kate's hand between us asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
