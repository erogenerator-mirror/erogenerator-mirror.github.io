He'd tried, and it was still early, but he'd had some luck, and found that he was still having fun. It was not as though they had an exclusive relationship... no. But still. This had to end. Then it was all gone.</p> <p>"Are you coming up to my room?" He answered the phone.</p> <p>"Soon." It hadn't even come up on the extension, but his mother answered a few seconds later, and he could swear that she just smiled.</p> <p>"Good. I was looking forward to coming up and seeing you. You've still got a long session in mind and I'll keep you company for just a few minutes. It'll save on my fees so you'll get it for free."</p> <p>"Sure, babe."</p> <p>"Great."</p> <p>A few minutes later, he hung up, tossed down his cell phone and ran off into the hall and through the front door. He was going to look for the right clothes for a quickie with his mother and then go off to his room... he felt like his heart was going to beat through his chest as soon as he got out of bed, but he still had plans.</p> <p>He'd come to his room, and she'd gone to her room the next morning... with no way she was in her bra and panties. They were already discarded so he was going to have to make a quick run for them, then he'd grab a pair in the morning as well. Maybe when he got out of work he'd try that again, but he'd only be gone for two days, and then he would get his chance to look at some sexy lingerie, and then go home and jerk off... he didn't know it, but he was pretty sure that he couldn't wait.</p> <p>He started to rummage through the closet for the things he needed... and he found a blouse and slacks. That was okay. He didn't need the outfit he had on, but it would definitely be worth it. He had tried it on and looked like it made for a woman in stockings and heels, but it wasn't something that a man could wear in the presence of a woman. But then, he wasn't about to have his mother wearing it and, besides, it was probably enough. He'd also decided that he would leave on the stockings and heels, if things went that way.</p> <p>* *</p> <p>The last thing he heard when he knocked on her bedroom door was her voice. "Is everything okay with you?"</p> <p>He heard the words "yes" and "I'm really sorry, but you just got up... it's about the morning break. I'll give you the key to the store room and we'll go... you're okay..."</p> <p>He let her in, and took one last look around, and walked to her room. He knew he looked a good size when he got up to her bedroom. Her room was tastefully decorated, with simple, elegant furniture and high, artful furniture. It was definitely a girl's room, as every single thing was a girl's. He was very glad he got her the key... and he sure did feel like a little boy. A girl is a girl, he knew it... but his mother did.</p> <p>He'd had a good day on the phone too, and then another one himself, but they were still a long time. He hoped for a little longer, though, since he could really spend a lot of time on his computer and looking at porn. They really did work for him, though... he could always email them, and it was fun to see a boy's reaction on his phone. At least to have a good feeling on the Internet. And they were better at it than he was.</p> <p>He decided to wait a few minutes and get off before he made anything more of a sound, though. He knew it was time to head off for the store room and then leave. He wanted to make sure he was not interrupting anything in the room, right away. There was one last thing he wanted to do before he got off before he got distracted.</p> <p>He decided to check the rest of her rooms. She had to have a key. There had to be something on her door when they got home. She must have a lot of room to work around. It was just a little way up past her door, so he wouldn't have to check it. When it did open, there was nothing on anything inside, just a pair of pants and a t-shirt laying there. Not panties or bra. He quickly pulled the shirt up and put a quick look on the door knob, and as he did, he saw that it was locked. When he knocked again, she didn't respond.
