It was almost an animalistic snarl with a tone of menace. Before I could react, it was gone.</p> <p>"I have no way of knowing what you are, but I don't understand why you are telling her no. I think you may have brought some trouble to your friend," I said, trying to understand the person who had spoken to me. She looked back at me with a strange mix of defiance and terror in her eyes. I decided to back off a little and help her with my questions.</p> <p>"You had me worried, Sir," she said in a small, scared voice, "please, you must be the Master. You must understand that my time with you will not leave me. I just wish to help make up for my little accident which happened to me while I was out of the country. You may call me the Master, by the way." She sounded so anxious, I wanted some reassurance, but had to continue to try to understand what she was telling me.</p> <p>"I am sorry, but you are right. I want to get to know you better. I'm in your debt, Sir. I didn't mean to hurt you in any way. My intentions are honorable and only you understand. If you were hurt, I would have stopped. I mean, you were hurt because you couldn't tell me what you were feeling. I never felt like this before. I'm not so sure about my intentions but I believe I'm wrong, so do not worry. And I hope you don't mind if I call you what I call Sir. Do you understand?</p> <p>She began telling me what she had wanted to say in detail and I listened intently to her. I was fascinated by her, and the way she was talking. Her voice filled with uncertainty, and the fear the whole time she was talking to me. I watched the expressions on her face with an open-mouthed stare. She was lost in thought and emotion. I was in control, and had to control her. I wanted to do my best to make her happy and secure her life.</p> <p>"You like my name," she said softly, "I'm Sam, by the way. I love to learn. I was just beginning to discover it, and wondered how and what you thought I was."</p> <p>"Is that why you are calling me a slut," I asked, somewhat intrigued by her statement, "Is it something you would say if I looked at you?" I had hoped for more.</p> <p>"Actually," she said slowly, "No ... I can't. It's not necessary. It's personal. I only care about you and I don't think I would like to do anything wrong. I don't care why you put yourself above me in this. I don't know why you were hurt at all. I just want to know what makes you what you are now. Are you sure you want me to please you and to be your slave?"</p> <p>"Of course, if you would just listen to what you had to say. I have no problem. The situation I am in is as different as it is unusual," I added, looking at her for a long moment, "and I don't think the last thing I would ever want was for you to think I was something you had not enjoyed. So I will do what you say, if you can find the words to say it back to me."</p> <p>"I will do whatever you ask, Sir," she said. "Your wish is my command."</p> <p>Before she left, she reached over to me and took my face in her hands. She spoke very softly, almost in a dreamlike voice, "You may have a good time. I will make sure that your friend and I enjoy it the rest of your life as your slaves."</p> <p>"Don't be too long," I said seriously, "I need to make sure that you enjoy what we are about too. I'm sure we can spend some more time together before we can have sex."</p> <p>"Of course we will," she said with a smile, "I'm not sure I can keep my hands for very long without feeling self-conscious, Sir."</p> <p>"I'm sure you can," I agreed, "now that you will have some time to yourself, we'll see where it leads."</p> <p>After having my eyes examined, I led her back to her car, and drove back to my home. She was hesitant, but we seemed to make a lot of progress. After about the fourth or fifth try, I suggested we go inside. She was eager to do it on her own and we set up a dinner in the living room.</p> <p>While we were enjoying each others food, some of the questions that had been asked around the past few days began to come back to me.
