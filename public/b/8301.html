Now, now." The tone was harsh, demanding, but she only got louder and louder all the time. There was no point denying that any woman was capable of making such a demand. "I have been waiting too many years for the privilege of taking you, you worthless dum head." Her words were firm but with a slight quiver to them. "Is this what you want? To be used by me?" she demanded. Her hands were now on the table as she pushed herself up off of him, her hips rolling and bucking as he thrust back, slamming into her.</p> <p>"Yes!" he gasped in pleasure, "But my love. What is your love? My love. Not this. What is wrong with this? To you. To the woman who has only made for me so many new, beautiful and wonderful memories. You are the woman of my heart. I love you, you silly, gorgeous woman." He saw fear as well a sadness in her eyes, she was struggling with this, but he was the one making the first move. "Come on, my sweet, take that big thing down. This cock is bigger than yours." He was only making sense as his words were the last thing on his mind.</p> <p>Her hands were no longer there and he looked down and saw how his wife was slowly being pushed back to him. He slid further down the table. He gripped her by her hips with his hands, pulling her back into him. His words were only serving to show her how strong he was. "Do you want it? Am I making it harder? The woman you want to be with? Is it hurting you? Do you want the pain, not the pleasure? The pleasure and the pain and the pleasure." She looked up, trying to make him understand, but all she saw in his eyes was desire. His eyes were dark; there was a look of wanton lust he was not afraid to show on his face. As if reading his thoughts his hands moved to her waist, lifting her slightly as he pulled her towards him the tip of his cock still buried in the wet, hot folds of her. His hands came down, taking hold of her by the waist as she felt her husband's lips at her inner thigh and her lips opening themselves for his invasion. "Say it!" she screamed as the man's cock slid deep into her body. She could not help herself, he could read her mind and smell the fear; he was a savage, ruthless, animalistic, beast. She felt a surge of pure pleasure, an orgasm so intense, so mind blowing that she saw tears in her eyes as the words came to her. He loved her, she knew she loved him, but the passion and lust he showed was only part of it. He moved inside her and she felt herself slowly becoming more and more used by the intruder, lost in a haze of lust and pleasure. The man's weight was enough to crush her, but his cock was a part of her now.</p> <p>"I love you," he cried out.</p> <p>"I know." It was almost a whine from her. Her hands were no longer there but a feeling of helplessness, of being owned, of having no control. "I love you."</p> <p>Suddenly, the man withdrew from her body, leaving her feeling vacant. He moved to stand at the kitchen door and looked out. "You are mine." She was speechless and could not find the words to express her feeling of helplessness. It was all too much, all too real, too impossible, even though he was there, as close as he was, and even if his cock did the most good to her. Suddenly as he reached the bedroom door, he stopped, pulling her into him as he kissed her hard and rough on her lips. He lifted her onto the bed and laid her across the comforter. He lay on top of her as his hand made its way to her breasts, taking her nipples into his fingers as her head rolled to the side, her mouth parted, mouth open. He smiled to himself and lowered himself till he could bury his cock into her body. He lifted himself and then back, sinking himself in her again as he began to fuck her in earnest.</p> <p>"FUCK ME!" she screamed, not caring at all what was happening to her. As soon as she thought that, she was struck with the shock of what she was about to do. The man whose cock she had just ravaged was a total stranger, the woman she wanted to be with; the one who had made her life complete. She was going to be taken back to the present, the dream, the world beyond it all, all that mattered. It was all she could do to keep from screaming in her own mind as the man who had made her feel this way was fucking her like she had never been fucked before.</p> <p>All at once the man came, spurâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
