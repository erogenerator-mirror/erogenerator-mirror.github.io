A single finger slowly pulled up the hem of her little black skirt to expose the bare skin of her smooth, toned thigh. Her breathing, deep and shallow, began to become heavy and heavy, until his finger was all the way up her skirt and on her bare leg and then she was suddenly aware he was looking at her and smiled widely. Her breasts were now thrust out firmly, her nipples were hard, pointing the full length of her body. She felt his face press to her neck, just a fraction of an inch away from her skin.</p> <p>She closed her eyes and leaned forward slightly. Her skirt was now hiked up almost to her hips and he could just barely see the tops of her black panties. Her eyes remained closed as he leaned over and licked the side of it. She felt his lips brush against her shoulder. Her lips were still sealed to him, but now he opened his mouth and brushed back over her and she felt his tongue slide out for a moment.</p> <p>She felt his hands sliding up over her hips and lower waist and she felt his fingers slip under the elastic waistband of her panties. His fingers stroked her briefly from side to side as he began stroking her softly across her thighs. He lifted her skirt up further and she opened her eyes briefly. He was looking at her now, her panties pulled completely away from her, her ass thrust out even more for him, completely exposed. She loved her panties almost as much as she loved her ass. The panties had always been completely pulled up her leg, so that they were a little more substantial when she bent over. Now her panties were held up by two of his long fingers and sliding up the inside of her thigh as his mouth moved over her.</p> <p>It was like she was in the middle of an electrical current and it could be very intense. He felt her hips move in response to his touch and he reached up and pulled her closer to him and let his long finger slide deep into her very wet pussy. His tongue moved over her skin lightly as he caressed her through the fabric of her panties. Her eyes opened fully and her mouth fell open and she saw him standing and he lowered his head back to her. They kissed again deeply and passionately, their tongues swirling over each other's mouths in slow, rhythmic movements.</p> <p>She was surprised when his lips moved over her mouth, not just her lips, but her chin, her lips and her tongue. As he moved over her she couldn't believe it. She was completely overwhelmed with his presence. His skin was a very soft, sensual and sensual touch. He lifted her chin, looking her in the eye, before kissing her, his hands holding her hips. She could feel herself trembling. He looked into her eyes, her eyes closed in an expression so beautiful, so soft. The look in his eyes was so pure and so vulnerable. It was as if he were looking at her, and it made her feel special to be completely vulnerable to him.</p> <p>His lips moved down her face to her neck and his tongue made circles around her neck, her earlobe and her throat. She felt his hands begin to slide over her body. He gently unbuttoned her jacket and slipped it off. She felt his hands slip her sweater off of her and her bra followed. He pressed himself against those full breasts that she loved so much and was amazed at the way they slid with him. She felt so full and so very sexual, she wanted to feel those breasts against her.</p> <p>She felt his hand move higher and begin to cup her breasts, squeezing and teasing her nipples until they were solid. His fingers pressed lightly against her panties where they found the seam between the lips of her pussy. She gasped as one finger went just under her clit and the other slowly slid up inside her pussy lips, gently searching. She could not believe how excited she was just having the first touch. Her pussy was dripping wet. She felt his fingers slide lower still and slip around her panties, pulling them down slightly before sliding smoothly over her pussy. Her body almost convulsed at the sudden contact with bare skin, but her mind was completely lost.</p> <p>His hands moved back up to hers and he guided them over her body, leaving them to rest on her hips. She knew that he wanted her to move her hand down to touch the base of it, but for the moment she held nothing back. His body looked so perfect like that. It was the size of her ass and had curves in all the right places too, like her head had been on an upside-down "V" on TV.</p> <p>She felt his hand leave her hips for a moment, she was aware of the movement, but she didn't care. It felt so good to touch him again. She leaned forward and felt the backâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
