What do you think?"</p> <p>"I think this will be fun. If it comes to it."</p> <p>"You know I have always fantasized about you having such sexual relations."</p> <p>She laughs and adds, "The girls, um, I mean all four of them at the same time, would like to fuck her."</p> <p>"And just in case you want to."</p> <p>"Yes, please."</p> <p>I smile. "I want to also get your mind off those other things."</p> <p>"I'm sure you're not finished yet."</p> <p>A moment later we walk into the bedroom and walk back to the bed. I kneel down and kiss her. I run my hands over her body. I love the way her flesh is hard and her stomach is smooth. Her breasts are very pale and her nipples are small. She pulls at me.</p> <p>"Take me, take me now."</p> <p>I stand and take off my clothing. I see her in the mirror and smile. I lie on the bed and let her join me. We start kissing again and I remove her bikini top and feel her breasts press against my chest. I slide my hands down from her back and feel her breasts. She moans as she feels my fingers running over her skin and her stomach quivers as I slide my fingers beneath the elastic of her bottoms.</p> <p>She kisses me again and we lie on the bed. I'm on top of her and her breasts are on my chest as if they had a mind of their own. Our bodies are as close as friends would be when they were together. Her nipples hard and puckered, I run my fingers over them and then cup her ass cheek in my hand. I can feel my cock against her and slide it down a bit until it grazes over her slit. "God," she says.</p> <p>I roll off her and roll on my side so I am facing her back. She kisses the back of my neck and down to my ear. I can feel her tongue on my lobe and she pushes her tongue into my ear. The feeling is electric. Her breath on my ear as she blows on me. The feeling is a warm and erotic one.</p> <p>She kisses her way down my body, leaving a trail as she goes, down my chest, down my stomach and to my cock. She gently kisses it as it is growing in my stomach. She puts her hands on my body as she kisses and licks her way down. The feeling is overwhelming and I sigh in ecstasy. She kisses my balls as they become covered in her saliva. Her tongue on them while moving up to my cock, swirling all around it. I put my hands to her soft, smooth ass and hold her as she continues to lick me. She loves it when I do this to her. The feeling is mutual.</p> <p>She licks all around my shaft and then works her way down. My cock is now ready and she engulfs it with her mouth. She feels my shaft inside of her and starts to move up and down. She starts to moan as I am entering her throat. She loves to do this. The feeling of my cock in her mouth sends the right signals to her pussy. Her moaning seems to reach another level and she is starting to climax again. She pushes her head up and down on my cock, and I can feel my own release rising. I tell her to stop and I roll off her. We lie there and take in the feeling of the other person on either side of us.</p> <p>We don't say anything as we hold hands and kiss tenderly. I say to her that it is her turn next. She smiles and says her turn for sex is already up. We laugh and we continue to fondle each other. She slides down on the bed and takes me in her mouth. She is a quick learner. She licks and sucks my cock and balls taking the time to really enjoy it. I tell her she is my favorite part of the night. She replies with a "yes I like too." She has great enthusiasm, and she gets my orgasm off without using her hands.</p> <p>The feeling of her hand on my cock takes me back and I am in heaven. As I near my orgasm so does she. She slides her hand down and starts to lightly massage my balls for a while. She gently strokes her hand down the shaft and up again. The feeling of her hand against my balls is incredible. She goes back to my cock and sucks me back in. As her hand continues to move my cock in her mouth I tell her to stop. She looks disappointed and I say to her, "You know I have never told you that." She looks surprised and I reply, "Don't mind me."</p> <p>She smiles and says, "What are you talking about?"</p> <p>"Don't youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
