The sight of her sucking and tonguing my dick was incredible. It wasn't nearly as much as it had been, just enough to make me want to be the one in control. Katie went back to her own work on my balls, licking and sucking one and then the other as her fingers continued to probe my anus.</p> <p>Her thumb began to rub my perineum, gently teasing out the tightness there. It was so sensitive. I tried to relax, and Katie took advantage of it by pushing the tip of her middle finger directly against my rim. I let out a gasp of pleasure- at the contact it wasn't enough, the tip of her finger slipped inside and I was startled. I tried to move my hips, but couldn't with our positions, so I held myself in place as she explored me further, working her finger into the second knuckle.</p> <p>Katie pulled her finger back and looked up at me. 'Relax, honey,' she murmured. 'Just relax.' She moved back down the length of the sofa to a small shelf on which stood the black, velvet dildo. She picked up the phallus and began to slide herself over the top of it. I could only see her hand, which seemed so soft and well-coordinated to be sliding up and down the length of a large shaft that was in her hand. She lifted her left leg and spread herself as far apart as her thigh would allow. She watched me watch her as she took her left hand and began working the tip of the dildo along its length, her other running along the shaft.</p> <p>As the dildo grew and I saw the tip slowly disappear inside her pussy, so my attention was on Katie's pussy, I took a deep breath. I've never been so aroused that I thought the feeling would overwhelm every fiber of my own being as I watched my wife being fucked by another man.</p> <p>Katie began to push herself up and down on the shaft. I could only imagine that we weren't the only man in the world getting a good look. I heard myself emit a low groan as her pussy enveloped me. My dick was so hard it hurt, but the sight of my wife's sex-starved body plowing into another man's was like being tied up to rope with ropes.</p> <p>After a few minutes of watching my lovely wife being used by another man, I took the hint. I moved around on the sofa and pushed her forward and over it, which lifted her tits to offer the tops for me to suck them. I pulled her left nipple with my lips and gently bit its tip as I reached my right hand between her legs and began stroking it. Her body tensed as she realized a stranger's fingers were exploring her. We watched each other as she was lifted off the dildo and dropped by another man's hands so they could explore her more intimately.</p> <p>My wife's eyes were closed now – she was letting out little moans and sighs as she felt the fingers working her pussy; it wouldn't be long before I was rewarded by a finger inside her. Her eyes were still closed, but she wasn't moving her hips in any particular rhythm anymore – just letting me pleasure her. I felt her pussy muscles begin to tighten around my dick as she prepared for another explosive orgasm – she was loving it. She seemed to enjoy it enough to hold my own in check, but I wasn't about to give up until I was in control once again.</p> <p>I wanted to take it up a notch – I had to! Katie had been sopping wet. Her hands had been in their own gear, playing with her body.</p> <p>'Please, Jack. Please fuck me. I need to feel you inside me.' She was panting heavily now, trying to concentrate on what the other man in front of her was doing to her.</p> <p>'You want this? You need this? I've been with a few different women, and I'll be your first. I just hope it's good enough to make you cum. I haven't cum like this before, but I want to make you mine.' A smile curved her lips at my words, just like Katie's had many times before. It was more of a challenge than an offering. I saw her eyes widen as she continued to play with herself even as we watched a third man, dressed in black, stand nearby.</p> <p>The thought of being controlled like this crossed my mind: I have to be the center of attention when the man behind me takes control.</p> <p>Her mind raced. She started to beg, not just for him to take her, but for them to fuck her. She couldn't believe what was happening. A thrill ran through her. She was enjoying it to the point where she thought she might even cum without—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
