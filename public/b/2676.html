She said quietly. After several more thrusts I felt my cock head expand a little as my sperm-laden balls contracted. As I erupted inside her warm pussy, I had a small orgasm, as well, and my hands dropped to her breasts and squeezed the two globes as I unloaded.</p> <p>"Oh, Daddy!" she cried out.</p> <p>We cuddled as we rested. And I noticed that she was crying again.</p> <p>"What's the matter, darling! Did she hurt you?"</p> <p>"Hurt me? Yes! She is my lover! She was a whore. And I didn't do what I did! Please, don't put it past her!"</p> <p>"Hush! I don't think it has to be that way. What woman would want a good man like you?"</p> <p>"Yes!"</p> <p>We cuddled until we fell asleep. I lay on my back on the couch while she cuddled next to me on her back. It was as if one day we were in love and that we had no need of the other's presence. It was as if we had a love that we had never before had. I was totally infatuated with my daughter. I was looking forward to becoming her lover.</p> <p>***</p> <p>I did the honors of having a wonderful dinner with the two best friends of my wife's that I had been having some problems with. We had a lovely dinner. The wine was delicious, the conversation engaging and engaging. It was clear that we both felt the same way. I noticed her looking at me.</p> <p>The conversation became increasingly sexually charged. I was feeling very comfortable with my daughter. She had no worries about the future because she was a wonderful and beautiful woman. I didn't mind being with her in that way because I never had to worry about anything like that. I had felt the same way with Helen.</p> <p>We had dinner and I saw all the other couples for the first time. There were twenty other young ladies with their husbands, some married and some single. Then a number of wives were on the other side. After dinner we all went back to our own rooms for some rest.</p> <p>There in the dark, we kissed and touched and caressed each other until we fell asleep.</p> <p>The next day, we went to the courthouse and took my daughter's clothes and her keys. I carried hers into the courthouse and I gave them to my daughter. I had some trouble walking, so I grabbed my daughter's dress and panties and helped her with her dress and panties again then I gave them to her husband. She sat on a corner bench and I placed her panties on his nose as I had done all day.</p> <p>I got dressed and left. By this time I was already a thousand miles away from my daughter.</p> <p>I drove to my daughter's college and took my car, so I didn't have to worry. The first couple of miles on the road I couldn't find a motel in the far side of the state. I drove for a few miles until I saw a motel and I parked.</p> <p>We found a motel by the lake and I went inside and closed the door. She came into my arms and immediately I kissed her deeply. We made small talk, and then we went to her bed. Once I got there she climbed onto the bed and I climbed onto the second bed and we made love for the first time that night. Afterwards we slept very well.</p> <p>A while later we began to think about what we were going to do when our daughter left for college. We both felt we needed to be able to continue, and that we needed to remain friends forever, because we both felt we needed that more every day of our lives. Our relationship was growing, and I was hoping in time our relationship would be better than that.</p> <p>We both knew that she wanted a permanent relationship with me so that we could be alone and we would never be apart again. We needed the reassurance that our relationship had been built to last, as it was now. But we also knew that at some point she would leave our relationship for a better one, because she felt it would forever be a one time thing. Now was that time?</p> <p>It was now ten days before she was scheduled to graduate. We still knew it had to wait. We were so happy to have our relationship back. We were always so happy when it was a one time event. Now though, for some strange reason we were both hoping, looking forward to that night, to be together again.</p> <p>We had a very long day that day, but we were also thinking deeply. We knew we wanted to be together again, but we also knew that it was a possibility. I realized on the very first day we began making love, and we found a rhythm that suited us. We enjoyed each other and we loved each other.
