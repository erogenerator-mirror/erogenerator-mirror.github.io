I can always start slow but I want to make her wet so she's ready for it soon."</p> <p>"She's ready for it soon?" I asked with a grin.</p> <p>"Yes, please baby, hurry"</p> <p>I felt his hand run down my back and start rubbing it. I arched my back and pushed my body into his hand a little more. The muscles in my stomach and groin tightened then relaxed, my face turned into a big smile as the pleasure slowly made its way up to my brain. "She likes it slow, she likes it hard, she likes something fast, she likes it soft, soft and slow" I said softly.</p> <p>"Ok, that's just what we want, now we can start to make her wet"</p> <p>I felt the hand on my bum cheeks start stroking them. I arched my back more and started pushing them apart. My head swam. His hand ran up my thigh towards my pussy. I spread my legs apart for him as we both got a little closer.</p> <p>I felt his hands slide back into my panties, slowly, his fingers slid up my pussy lips, rubbing them slightly, I spread my legs as wide as possible and pushed them even wider, I moved my hips slightly and pushed my self back, opening myself fully to his fingers.</p> <p>He pulled out his middle finger and slid it into my pussy, slowly, slowly, slowly, I moaned, and he started to finger fuck me again. I pushed back with my body and pushed up for him again. My lips parted and closed in tune with my body as I pushed back against him trying to feel him deeper. I tried to feel as he slid in, deeper, but it was only a half an inch, and he just pushed that to the side. Finally he pulled out and ran his finger along my open lips, I was moaning again. He slid his finger in and out a little in a rhythm before sliding it back in again and doing it again this time. I pulled back again. My body was in absolute bliss, and when he hit something I started again.</p> <p>His fingers were still in me and he started again, his thumb rubbing my clit, circling it then running his finger over it, making me even wetter. I started to get wetter, my breathing was getting ragged. My back arched more with the pleasure, he pulled his finger out of me, and ran it round my lips again and into my pussy again. I felt his thumb touch me but instead of going in, he slipped his finger back inside, it just slid in.</p> <p>His thumb had moved to my clit and he started to rub it in slow circles as his other hand continued to run around my clit. I felt a wave of pure pleasure sweep over me, then suddenly I felt something new to him. He rubbed and squeezed my clit with his thumb as his finger slid down further into my pussy. It was an inch bigger in my pussy than his finger, something amazing. He started to slide his thumb in as his finger came out, moving it to side and then back to the tip. He did this for a while as his fingers rubbed me, the pressure in my pussy built and he rubbed me faster. I tried to push back harder to make it happen, to feel as much of him as I could without losing my mind.</p> <p>"Oh baby, I love it so much. Can I kiss you now?" he asked.</p> <p>I almost came right then, it was the most beautiful thing I had seen, he had kissed me. His breath was hot and I could feel his heart beat.</p> <p>"No, I have to go, I have to get dressed, I want to go to a concert tomorrow.</p> <p>My breath caught in my throat. His lips touched mine, he kissed my lips then my chin and then my neck. I was just about cumming again when he pulled away.</p> <p>"No, no, no, you're not ready yet" he said with an evil look.</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Yes, really," I said "I have to get home ok?"</p> <p>"Just one more thing"</p> <p>"Ok" I replied, "Can I kiss you? "</p> <p>"Sure" he said "I'd like that"</p> <p>"You're the boss now."</p> <p>I had thought it, I was the boss, and now we were both just lying in bed, naked, in total bliss.</p> <p>"Ok" I said "come again tomorrow then? "</p> <p>He looked at his watch, "7"</p> <p>Just as he said his name the phone rang, I put the phone down and looked at him "Who wants you to speak with todayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
