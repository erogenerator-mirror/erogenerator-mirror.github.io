You like that?" She asked.</p> <p>"Oh yes, Mistress." He croaked</p> <p>"I'm glad you like it, honey. I've wanted to do this for so long." She smiled. She pulled him slowly against her lips, sucking the tip into her mouth. "Does that excited you? Hmmm? Does it turn you on to fuck a beautiful woman? Your wife? Is she excited to please you? Can you imagine fucking a gorgeous woman? A hot woman? Does your wife like to be pleased?"</p> <p>"Yes," he cried, his body writhing as he begged. His orgasm overtook his senses. She held him still with her mouth, sucking gently as he came in waves, his climax slowly ebbing with each breath. Her hands felt incredible as he squeezed his legs together in orgasm, pressing himself hard against her. As she released his dick, she ran her hands down the outside of his legs, her fingers moving in small circles around his throbbing member. His hips were still pumping slowly in rhythm with his hips.</p> <p>"Mm, that's it. Fuck me." She encouraged.</p> <p>His body relaxed and shivered as his climax slowly returned.</p> <p>"You did very good," she said as she slid from the bed and turned to get his wet mouth.</p> <p>"You're not going anywhere," he joked, sucking gently on her lower lip and running his tongue up and down the top of her face before kissing her full on the mouth for several minutes. Her arms wrapped around his head as their mouths came together, kissing passionately and passionately. Both had a desire for the other, yet neither felt the desire to be intimate.</p> <p>"Let me show you something," she said with a grin, crawling back to the bed and taking his semi-erect dick into her mouth. She started bobbing her head, the soft warm skin of her cheeks gliding around. After only a minute, she pulled off and climbed up on the bed, facing away from him. He reached into the nightstand and took some lubricant.</p> <p>"Kneel," he said as he squeezed a huge dollop of it onto his fingers, and then into the back of her throat. She moaned as he pushed up against it and then started a steady pressure as he forced her body forward; forcing her to take his cock in both her mouth and her cunt. He took more of it into her, feeling how much she pushed back against him as she swallowed. Her lips wrapped around the base of his dick as she pulled it out, feeling how slick his skin was as he ran his fingers through her ponytail. As he pushed, he heard her moan again as the head of his cock disappeared into her throat. As she pulled him out, he felt her tongue slide up along the underside of his dick, feeling the smooth skin of her lips and cheeks surrounding his cock. It pushed him to the edge, as she swirled her bottom lip in a tight circle on the top of his cock, tickling his tip with her tongue. He groaned as his balls tightened as he felt himself growing hard; the pressure building up as he prepared to cum.</p> <p>"Ohhh, Goddessesssss," he cried out as he pushed down harder against her. She felt him start to shudder and knew what it was that he needed to cum. She moved her hand to her clit and pulled on it slightly, causing it to swell and pulsate against her hand. She pushed faster as she felt him tighten and saw him wince as he came, his hot sperm shooting into her mouth. As soon as his cum stopped, she kept her lips tight against his dick and released him. His fingers moved, pulling her hair away from her face as he watched the glistening strings of his cum drip over her chin, her neck, and across her tits. She wiped it up with her hand as she watched, then licked it off. He was still coming down, but he was recovering as he sat up in the pillows. She crawled up to him, giving him a long lingering kiss on the mouth.</p> <p>"Do you feel better now?" She asked.</p> <p>"Oh yes, Mistress, it does." He laughed.</p> <p>"Now that we are back to normal, I think you will get plenty of rest and then you can give me a massage." She leaned in to gently kiss his earlobe and then his cheek. Then she pushed off him and stood before him. She reached up and pulled his shoes off and then his pants as she undid his pants. His member sprung upward and slapped her in the mouth as she pulled them off and then pushed him down on the bed. She crawled up so she could run her hands all over him making him shiver. She ran her breasts in circles before finally taking his throbbing cock and running her hands all over him before letting himself breathe again.
