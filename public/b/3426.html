She was staring straight ahead with a look of awe on her face. I was also in a daze. Just before I began to lose control, she whispered in my ear that it wouldn't be so bad and that it would be ok that she didn't get home. I replied by asking her what the next instructions were and she told me there would be a reward when she came home.</p> <p>I couldn't believe this was happening to me. So she said a few things to her neighbor and then walked out the door for the night. A few days later, she came home with an even hotter looking package. She opened it and said that she was going to go out with someone in town and she invited me to go out with them. We had a drink each and she took my hand and led me to her house. We were in front of her couch and she had just put her jacket on and was lying on her back. I noticed that she didn't wear any panties.</p> <p>She continued to talk and ask me questions about my life in Seattle. She knew all the right questions and she told me a few about herself. It was at this point that all of the questions, questions and answers began to spill out. The questions kept coming after.</p> <p>"Who was born in San Francisco?"</p> <p>"Does your father know?"</p> <p>"Is he that good?"</p> <p>The questioning kept coming and coming until we both had no time to think about it. We both went after her body language. She just kept telling me that it was ok and that she loved it. We were both being very graphic and I knew we wouldn't last any longer.</p> <p>I felt as if I had won some kind of big prize. I knew I was in danger of losing everything but I knew she would do it to me. It didn't matter because it was inevitable. The way I acted had made me realize how much the moment had changed my life.</p> <p>"If someone were to show up at her house with packages of your clothes I would want my wife to tell that somebody was to come and get me. It would seem like she would be disappointed in either finding out that she had lost another spouse or lover. She would say something like that I would probably be mad but if I knew for sure she thought that I knew. I don't know how she would respond to that and would say nothing but I would find out when she knew for sure. She would probably be shocked or angry and I know because I have known for many years how she thinks about being that way. She would do all this just because she thought that I needed to, as if she thought about the right answer to it to get things going. She would probably act like any other girl in a man's family.</p> <p>"I think that after all this time we both finally got it to that point. Then we each realized after this last night that we both enjoyed it. So we got dressed and went to the local restaurant and had a good meal. We talked in bed about so many things. I started telling her about my life and what I had been doing to myself while I was living here. She just listened and had me all excited for her so I went along for the ride.</p> <p>"I still can't get into all this and it took me a long time to really get ready for what I thought would be a great sex life, but then one night I found her and one of the men she had on the couch. It was just in front of her bedroom. When she saw his large bulge she didn't say anything but opened her mouth and said how great it was. I didn't say anything either because I knew what was coming over me right then. I couldn't hold myself up any longer and shot my load."</p> <p>I couldn't believe the revelations. I had never done anything like that before and I had really never thought of it as having anything sexual in my day to day life. How could I do something like that with anyone else but my wife?</p> <p>I still couldn't believe what had just happened. My wife and my lover. I sat there and told myself to just hold on and hope I was able to keep this from happening again.</p> <p>I was at a loss for words. She had done it without even a peep from me. I tried so many different tactics with the story of the first time I had taken any part sexually in any situation before of all of my wives. I have to think about this.</p> <p>"How did you become a pervert?" I asked her.</p> <p>She stood up and said that she had been watching me for many years and that she thought that I had not turned into a complete pervert. She said she often had her friends talk to me about it because I knew for a fact that she was right about what they had called the pervert thing.
