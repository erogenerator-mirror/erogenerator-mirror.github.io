I thought I would make a beeline for the back door.</p> <p>I was going to turn around and start to run to the door but I just lost my balance and my feet fell to the floor.</p> <p>I was in a world of pain. Everything was wrong. I just kept saying that I couldn't be with someone because it was just wrong because my body told me I shouldn't be with someone. I tried to sit down. I sat down. I tried to take everything that I was thinking and seeing and everything that was inside my body in. I couldn't look at the people. I couldn't look at the pictures of them because of everything that had to be at least a mile in their heads. But I just couldn't do it. I wasn't there anymore. I was there only where I needed to be. I was there now when he had to go away. I was there at the altar of his destruction. I was there that night.</p> <p>I just slumped back against the wall and slowly fell to my knees. I was dead to the world.</p> <p>I tried to hold on to hold on to control my body back. I held on to the world that I had been in and couldn't fight off. My mind was blank. My vision was red. My vision was black.</p> <p>I felt like I was going to be sick. I thought I was going to vomit so I just laid there trying to get control of myself. I guess I felt that I could control my legs which really wasn't doing anything to get my legs down. I could have been able to control my legs but there was no way I was going to go home. I didn't even have his number.</p> <p>I could hardly stand still. My body was shaking. It was all I could do to keep from collapsing on the ground. My legs were flailing all over the place. My head was in complete fear. I couldn't even look at myself. I just wanted to crawl into his big box and die with relief. I was trying to catch my breath. My feet were still flailing but not like before. It was like I was caught with my legs in a vice. They had given way beneath my body because of what I had just done.</p> <p>My body was moving all over the place. All the way down, I think because my legs were moving allover. I didn't know it at the time but my body was moving through my veins. My limbs were feeling like they were getting heavier but I couldn't move them. It was like I was being propelled through them. My legs kept shaking as though I was trying to pull them down further.</p> <p>I could feel the world slipping around me. It was a horrible nightmare. I couldn't move my arms. I couldn't move my limbs. But my body kept moving as though it was trying for stability in the universe. It was moving as though I was going to die. My heart was beating too fast. My head felt as though it had stopped. I thought it was going to fall. My body was flailing as though I was a giant robot ready for a run. I felt like I was going to be sick right now.
