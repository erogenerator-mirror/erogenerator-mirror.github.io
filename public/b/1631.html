"That's not that it is." He paused, unsure of what to say or do. He didn't want to hurt her in any way. "I'm not sure that's such a good idea." He looked down at her breasts. "I want nothing more to do with it," he said. "Do you have someplace you would like to go?" He looked into her eyes, trying to gauge her mood. Not that she was upset. "Well, there is this hotel in the downtown area." He turned and headed toward the hotel. He hadn't come this far for himself, he decided, so that would be no long trip. It wasn't an easy thing to do, and he knew she wouldn't stay at his place on her own.</p> <p>"It's almost closing time," she said. She turned to look at him. "I'm really glad you came," she said. She turned and walked toward the restroom. He followed her in. "So, did you decide to come down tonight?" she asked. She was standing in the middle of the room. "I know it's kind of noisy in there," she said. "Let me go change." He watched as she walked out, then started to close the door. He couldn't believe it, but she never shut the door. He opened it, and stared at her. Standing in the middle of the room, looking as sexy as he had ever seen her, was her husband. "Oh, my," he said, running his eyes up and down her body. "She has a very nice body," he said.</p> <p>"Thanks," she said and stepped away from him. She held her hand out to him. "Come over here," she said. He looked at her and saw that she was not very tall. She was maybe five or six feet. He stepped forward and she grabbed him and pulled him into a hug. "Are you a big boy now?" she asked him. He smiled. "I don't think so, but I'm willing to learn. And I want you...all of you...to come to one o'clock tonight. The lights have changed, but there shouldn't be much traffic." He stood, smiling. "My husband will be here, in a minute." The house was dark, and he was amazed that she was so quiet.</p> <p>She walked him into the restroom and they walked together into the light. He undressed before she sat on the toilet and started to take off his clothes. She grabbed him and pulled him toward the bathroom. He had a big, hard tent in his pants that she could hold without looking up. She had only been in the restroom a couple minutes, when he walked out of it and started to take off the rest of his clothes. She watched him, seeing the bulge in his pants move slowly down. She could feel her pussy gushing with excitement at the thought of seeing him naked, and she quickly turned away from him. "I'm sorry," she said, trying to pull away. "I just...I don't know if...I'm not sure I can...I mean...let me go," she said, turning her body and pulling him in front of her.</p> <p>His hands were all over her before he even took in her face. Her mouth was soft and moist, and she kissed him hard, her tongue slipping between his lips. She broke the kiss and looked into his eyes. "I can't, I'm so not into kissing anymore." He looked back and down at her. She still had her hand on his face, but she pulled it away, pulling herself away from his gaze.</p> <p>"I really am sorry, but I don't think I can," she said. She dropped to her knees between his legs and pulled his erection right up against his belly. "I know I haven't had sex in a couple years, but..." she said. "Would you mind if I did this for you?" her voice was soft, barely audible. He felt it and nodded. He wasn't sure where this was leading—some place they hadn't had sex in for the past few months, at least not in public. His cock had never really gone soft; just standing to attention. She quickly took his cock in her mouth, swirling her tongue around the crown and then starting it's decent in her mouth. She pulled up and her lips and tongue went back down his shaft, this time taking every inch of him into my throat. She held him there, for a few moments, before moving up again. He looked down and watched her mouth slide back down his shaft, her cheeks hollowing as it did so. "You sure you want to take it in there? In the ass?" she asked. "I like the thought of it," he said. "Really do," she said. She held onto to his balls as she took him—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
