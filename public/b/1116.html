It was a freedom she had never had or wanted and she also knew it was something that was possible for a relationship to survive in those circumstances. She needed what was needed.</p> <p>She had to admit that there was a real strength that she could feel about the two relationships. She would take the time to make one up to her.</p> <p>She knew that was a dangerous thing for a young woman of her sexuality to take, but she did.</p> <p>She needed to keep her independence, at least until those two relationships turned into something more and with her own freedom. She needed an honest and open relationship to the point that the sexual tension between them could grow, develop and evolve.</p> <p>For her it didn't have to be monogamous at all. No one could just take the kids for a week.</p> <p>She needed to have a loving and open relationship with someone. That said she had to find out who that person was.</p> <p>For her to be honest and open she had to find a good person, who would help her.</p> <p>Chapter One</p> <p>Ricky lay there between Lisa's legs, watching his girlfriend's pink puffy pussy lips rise and fall with each breath.</p> <p>"I think that I'm starting to lose it," he thought.</p> <p>"Just do what it takes. This isn't just a sex experience," he told himself.</p> <p>"I really do love her. And if we're in for an event like this I do love her too."</p> <p>His dick hardened in his pants. He had a good feeling that he would take whatever he could get from Lisa's body. He felt like he needed to cum.</p> <p>His heart was pounding in his chest. He reached over and pulled out of her grasp. He felt a wetness between her thighs.</p> <p>He saw Lisa's hand move beneath his to his crotch. She gripped it and rubbed his erection.</p> <p>Her head arched back and her eyes closed.</p> <p>"God," he thought. "She looks so beautiful. And I need to get back there and be with her."</p> <p>Ricky took a moment to admire her beautiful, naked body for the first time. He found himself mesmerized by her. He loved the contrast.</p> <p>His eyes drank in her perfect figure, naked, with smooth pale skin. She had large, high breasts, with hard nipples that puckered up when she was excited. He longed for her to touch them, to play with them. To touch them in public, anywhere. To lick them.</p> <p>Ricky was a little jealous of her. He wondered what was going through his friend's mind. He had tried to make it as far out as possible without losing his friend's girlfriend to his desires. Now it was different with Lisa.</p> <p>She was a beautiful girl. And she was his girlfriend. So if the situation warranted him coming back for whatever he could get.</p> <p>Ricky lifted up to Lisa with his cock out and she turned to get her feet on the bed. She pulled her legs up and spread them. She looked even more beautiful up close.</p> <p>Ricky ran his hand along her wet wet pussy and she was very wet. He inserted two fingers inside her. He was in heaven. He couldn't believe that what he was doing was really happening.</p> <p>"Fuck me," Lisa asked.</p> <p>Ricky smiled and lowered his body between her legs. He loved the feeling of her pussy engulfing his cock. She moaned as he entered her hole once again. He loved feeling his cock slide into her tight hole. His orgasm was close.</p> <p>Ricky kept pumping his cock into Lisa's pussy. His breathing got faster and he had trouble standing up. He tried to remain put with her and kept going as long as he could. But after his orgasm hit his body shook violently and he felt her pussy tighten around his cock again before he was finished.</p> <p>He collapsed over her, feeling exhausted physically.</p> <p>Ricky looked down at her, and Lisa smiled up at him.</p> <p>"You cum a lot."</p> <p>Ricky laughed. "You're so beautiful."</p> <p>"I'm glad," Lisa said.</p> <p>"That was a weird thing for me to do," Ricky said.</p> <p>Lisa laughed. "I thought I was having a good time."</p> <p>Ricky just smiled.</p> <p>Lisa reached up and took his hand into hers. "We'll go next time."</p> <p>"And next. I'm glad to see you again Lisa," he told her.</p> <p>"I'm glad too," she replied.</p> <p>The following week was a blur.</p> <p>Ricky could barely get the image of Lisa in his mind.
