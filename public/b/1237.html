I smiled and hugged him tight.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>Saturday afternoon, Alex lay in bed, with the sound of the water splashing in the garden. He was naked; still erect - I'd fucked him just like that twice but, in the morning, twice more..., and then all night.</p> <p>He was a wonderful lover, a quick one as well. He'd fucked me for hours, and I loved every minute! When we got out of bed, he lay next to me, cuddling up to my arm and murmuring to me.</p> <p>'I could fuck you all day,' he said in a husky voice, 'all day, and all night, and I could fuck you all night and we would be fucking each other all night! I might even let you suck me, too!' He sounded like he wanted more...'But first I've got to pee!' I wanted to cum again, so I rolled him over on his back. We shared the water bottle, and I climbed and climbed on top of him.</p> <p>We kissed, and I was going for his neck and shoulders, his broad chest, his flat stomach. We both liked it, and I liked going on top. He liked it too. I rolled over so I was on my hands and knees, facing away from him. I spread my legs, offering my bottom in tempting invitation. I watched the water go down, and the yellow stream trickle out and down between my buttocks. I loved fucking him from behind...'I didn't want you to feel jealous that I was having that with you?'</p> <p>My eyes met his, and I nodded, so he'd seen me in the mirror as I'd stood up. That's how I like it, and that made me hot. He got up and got another bottle of water from the side table and came forward, and squirt some on my bottom.</p> <p>'Wet me, then come inside me!' I said. I wanted to have my bottom fucked. I really wanted to feel him come inside me!</p> <p>My lover bent forward and, on his knees, put his hand, like he could reach it, under my bottom, and started to massage it. 'You are a horny girl..., you really are,' he said. I laughed. 'You know I love to let you do that,' he said.</p> <p>'Your turn now, then,' I said. He looked at me, and I kissed him. 'And I'm not going to wait until next time to get some pussy,' I said.</p> <p>We snuggled together in the bedroom and talked a bit. Alex turned to me. 'You ready to be a lesbian, Laura? I want you to go up to my room, take off your panties and lay in bed...'</p> <p>I giggled. 'Sure, darling. I might even suck you, if you want.'</p> <p>'Go ahead but, you look so good.' He got out of bed, went through to the bathroom, got a drink and a towel for he used for toiletries, and returned. I saw his cock, I just wished I could suck it. I'd seen it before, though it looked nice, I had no idea how big it was. He was naked.</p> <p>'Lie down, darling,' I said to him. He lay. I knelt behind him, put my head in the valley his buttocks, and, again, took his cock. I kissed and licked it, and kissed it again, and again, then I licked all over it, sucked on it, kissed it, kissed it....'</p> <p>'Mmm, it feels good, Laura. Now give it to me, please.' It felt good in my mouth. It was so stiff! I wanted it inside me.</p> <p>The next couple of words I've never told you were:</p> <p>Suck me!'</p> <p>'Suck my dick, please!'</p> <p>'Please do! I really can't think of anything I'd rather, darling. Suck me, please.'</p> <p>So, I gave Alex's cock a good suck, I got him as hard as a rock! I liked him - my lover - not just with my mouth. His cock was nice... but I had to tease it a bit. It was a nice, wet, slippery sensation! After a few strokes I kissed the tip, licked his balls, and took his cock back into my mouth. I knew he was ready for more action, especially now that I'd had enough teasing. I took him deep into my mouth, and I licked and sucked his balls. He was rock solid!</p> <p>After a short while I was ready for more of his wonderful cock.
