I told her about my ex and I dated my neighbor, a woman named Judy. A woman I had sex with and loved. At first I didn't see her as a woman, but as I did my thoughts got to more like a fantasy.</p> <p>I asked her to come with me on one of the tours. She thought it would be a good idea. She got naked on the bottom seat while I climbed in. She had just had sex with two men. We talked about our pasts, about our fears, our feelings, our fantasies. We talked about how my wife's relationship with her friends had changed, how we still got together and what we felt about the marriage. This was the first week of the anniversary weekend.</p> <p>I went and had lunch with Judy for a while until I saw a flyer on the computer screen. It was one that I had received about a year and a half ago. It reminded me of my high school days, a couple's history lesson in History. The picture showed two couples in a hotel room, and I was stunned to see they looked at each other's wives differently.</p> <p>Judy came over and we had to have sex before she could even think about that. The pictures showed us sitting with another man, and he was talking about them and about their sex life. The other couple were getting it on in bed as Judy sat next to me and watched. We had to have watched that. I had to take the damn thing out of my pants in front of Judy!</p> <p>It was so exciting in a way. We watched the couple on the other hand that looked directly and unabashed at one another. We talked about things like that forever.</p> <p>Judy began to get more excited. She had one finger in my pussy while kissing me and sucking on my earlobe. Our talking became more explicit when we touched each other's bodies and explored our private parts. Judy came twice, but was not able to do more than finger me.</p> <p>I was wet inside, but my pussy was so sensitive right now. She was breathing so hard from the excitement I was feeling. We were both breathing hard until we finally got quiet. I looked to my door and saw that the window was opened about 30 to 40 feet away. I knew they would see me now, but I still wanted more. I began to caress myself again while kissing Judy.</p> <p>I was so turned on that I wanted to do something else, but my hand was in no hurry. A few moments later I was on the floor with Judy between my legs. She put her face on my pussy and began to lick my pussy from bottom to top. I reached out for the back of her head and pulled her down on me for a deeper kiss.</p> <p>While doing this she was running her hand up and down my legs. I had a raging hard-on and she was stroking it, getting it hard. Judy leaned down and put it in her mouth and sucked on it while rubbing her own. After licking and kissing some more, Judy got up and got between my legs. Before I knew it she had my hard-on in her face. She was sucking on me and stroking my dick while we kissed. She moved her finger up and down my cock making it harder. I leaned back and closed my eyes as if I was totally immersed in the moment and couldn't do anything except let myself go into her mouth.</p> <p>We kissed a few more times before she took my hand and put it on her pussy and put my finger into her to feel how wet she was. Judy got the whole bed wet so that it only took a few moments to make her very wet. I slipped my finger in and out of her pussy with ease.</p> <p>We spent some time lying together in bed. After a while we got up and went to the bathroom to get ready for dinner. We had to talk about how it felt for us to have sex. It was a lot of talking, but we each wanted a chance to be with our new husband, the other for the rest of the night.</p> <p>We cleaned off after a shower. I still had the taste of Judy in my mouth, but this time I didn't swallow. I kissed her, and we tasted our secretions. This time we had more of our lips to our mouth than we did our tongues. Our hands were exploring each other's bodies when we heard them. A couple were making love on their bed in the direction of the bedroom door.</p> <p>Judy turned to me and we stood kissing for a few moments while they were fucking each other. We kissed each other, I put her feet on my shoulders as she was squatting over me. My cock was hard as a hammer. Judy slowly put her pussy on my rod, making sure it was deep where I was going, but not on my balls. It was the most eroticâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
