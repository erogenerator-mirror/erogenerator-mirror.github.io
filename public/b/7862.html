The feeling of her firm little hand in my hand. She pulled back towards me again and this time, my grip was so firm, I would have thought she would let go. She took my hand and pulled me down towards her. I was nervous, wanting to go and run away but her grip was firm. I didn't have much of a choice did she?</p> <p>I didn't expect that. As much as I had thought that I would let her take me, I never thought that I would find my lips meeting hers. Now, I thought, I was going to kiss my beautiful mother! And so, as I approached the edge of the pool my mother stepped down from the pool. Her body was magnificent, tanned and sleek, her body hair a thick black drape. Her tan line enhanced by her bikini top was clearly visible as I gazed down at her. I looked up at her face and could see the surprise in her eyes.</p> <p>"M-M-Mom?!" I stammered.</p> <p>She laughed at my expression.</p> <p>"Honey, there's a lot of other people here."</p> <p>"Yeah, Mom's here."</p> <p>"Is there some one else?"</p> <p>"Yeah," I said with a sheepish look on my face.</p> <p>Her hand was still on my arm, stroking it, her little hand still under mine.</p> <p>"Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it."</p> <p>"Okay," I responded, knowing that my mother was not upset or embarrassed in any way about what she had just seen.</p> <p>She let my arm go. Looking up at me, she said, "Come on, honey. I just want to see you to your bedroom."</p> <p>Her words caught me off guard. She did not look upset or embarrassed at the fact she had just watched me getting off. They gave me the confidence to take my mind off what I had just heard.</p> <p>I followed my mom up the hallway, trying to decide which bed she wanted. When I finally saw her room, I felt a little less apprehensive.</p> <p>"Take your time, honey." She smiled and pulled me into the room. "Go ahead and take your time."</p> <p>I followed her into her bedroom. I was about to take a shower when mom closed the door to her room behind me and took it all in. Her body glowed in the light of the moon, I could see she had taken off her bikini top on the trip, making her breasts stand out even more against the material.</p> <p>I followed her, standing in front of her, not sure of what to do. This was not what my mother expected, she just saw it and wanted me to move into her bedroom again.</p> <p>I stepped over to her and put my arms around her. "I love you," I told her quietly.</p> <p>My hand stroked her back as I embraced her, feeling the warmth of her body against me.</p> <p>"I love you too, honey. I want you every moment of the week and every hour of tomorrow. I want you to feel complete happiness. I want you to be happy in the morning. Come to me whenever you want to have a cup of coffee and talk."</p> <p>As I said this last part, I felt her hands on my bare chest, brushing my hair.</p> <p>"This is the way that I always say my love to you when we wake up. But I really love you this morning."</p> <p>I smiled at her words and she gave me a quick kiss and headed for the bathroom. I started to follow and she reached out to me. "Come to me when you're ready." She called and I let her lead me to the bathroom.</p> <p>I walked into the small bathroom and sat on the top step that went down into the bedroom. I sat waiting, wondering what she had thought. She was in her robe, brushing her long blonde hair back again and she was looking a little surprised when I came into the room.</p> <p>"Well, I heard things." I spoke to her as we sat in the tub.</p> <p>"Yeah ... what do you mean? I'm sorry."</p> <p>"Well, I didn't think we were going to come into the tub and get it in one piece. I figured you would need to do it without your bathing suit."</p> <p>"It's not like that."</p> <p>"But it sure does, doesn't it?"</p> <p>"Sometimes, it is."</p> <p>"So what's the big deal?"</p> <p>"I'm no dummy. I am one of those people with all these feelings. You know, feelings that go straight into my blood."</p> <p>"Well, let's get this water off and get into the tub, shall we?" I took the tub and sat.
