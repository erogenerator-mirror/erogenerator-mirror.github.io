Take a chance."</p> <p>"I'll take it," I smiled, shaking my head and looking at him. "But, I'll be careful, won't I?" I said.</p> <p>"Of course you will, sweetie," he said, looking at me again, "I'll always look at that pretty face every time I'm around you." I laughed softly. "It's like being the happiest man in the world," I smiled. I glanced at the clock. "Oh, god, it's almost nine!"</p> <p>"It's one o'clock," he said, putting down the phone and turning around to face me. "So, you're going to be late for work?" I said, taking his hand. "It won't be that bad," he said, sliding it down my arm and taking my fingers in his. "I've watched you," he said as he held my hand in his. He pulled me over to the couch, sitting me down and taking my shoes off as he did so. He sat down on the other side of me and took off his shirt, grinning at me. He kicked off his shoes, then stood up and pulled my sweater over my head. As I turned to take off my blouse, I saw him lean over to kiss me. My nipples became hard against him as our kisses became harder and deeper and our tongues began to explore each other, running together and exploring each other's bodies. He had his arms around me, holding me down from behind as we kissed, slowly pulling my shirt off slowly, then pulling me back against him as we kissed. He pulled me back up until I felt the bed beneath me and the soft hair around my pussy brush against his cock.</p> <p>"Oh fuck," I moaned.</p> <p>"I haven't had this much time, sweetheart," Michael said, still kissing me. He kissed his way down my body, kissing every inch of me as he was making his way toward my pussy. He took off my shoes one by one, removing my socks one by one, sliding his hands up my legs, taking off his shirt as well, finally tossing his shirt aside and running his hands over my body. He slid his fingers inside me, one, then two, slowly entering me, making them disappear again as he did. After a few moments, he slid my skirt off, leaving me in my bra and panties. Then, I felt his fingers inside me, slowly entering me while he ran his tongue over mine and into my mouth, swirling in and out in a way that drove my arousal up into the stratosphere and I felt myself quivering with sexual sensation. I knew where he was going with this and, without having to force myself to speak, just said, "Michael?"</p> <p>He pulled his cock out of his jeans and was kneeling between my legs. I'm pretty sure he wasn't that far over his ten or so years, even after I was done, and then, I'd never seen his cock in all that time. It turned me on to see it and feel it, to be able to tell how big it was and just what it was that looked so good with a nice, beautiful cock in my hands. "It's so big," I said and reached down with my hand. He just smiled and held himself up towards me a little, sliding himself inside me again as if his mind was having trouble with the idea of pushing himself right up inside that tight little pussy that he and he and I had been talking about so often.</p> <p>"God!" he said softly, holding himself up for a moment while I caressed my thighs, the only part of me that hadn't been touching it yet, "you're so wet!" I nodded, smiling, and he slowly slid himself out and held himself up for me so we could both look at it. "God, you've really got that thing inside you," he said and I reached my fingers out to stroke it slowly. "I didn't realize you had such a tight pussy there." He began to move in and out of me, his cock working against my clit in counterpoint; I could feel the muscles in his ass and the head of it pressing against my cervix as he pumped himself into me. He was smiling as he fucked me, his eyes staring at me the whole time, his breath coming in deep gasps and I loved the way he looked like he was enjoying himself as much as I was. The look on his face told me that just as much as what I was feeling, his own eyes telling me that he was. His hips began to pump faster, his balls slapping against me in rhythm with his strokes and I pushed forward on him to meet him.</p> <p>"Oh! Michael!"
