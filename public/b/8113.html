I didn't really know what to think, she was so beautiful. What did I want from her?</p> <p>"What are you thinking about?" She asked as she leaned over to me.</p> <p>"I know how lonely you can get." She said as she ran her fingers through my hair.</p> <p>"And how would I get lonely?" I asked.</p> <p>"I know exactly what to say. I can't quite explain how I can relate."</p> <p>The next thing she said to me was, "So, if you need to have someone to talk to." At that point I was so overwhelmed I started to think of everything that happened. I had a hard time thinking in any order. My mind went back to a moment years ago when I saw her on the bus and she had that look in her eyes... those eyes that told me everything. I know she did. And I don't know why but that look in her eyes was as mesmerizing as it was overwhelming. I knew that she saw it in my own eyes when she smiled and she smiled at me. She never let go... her hand stayed right where it was.</p> <p>She brought her lips to mine as she started to slowly push her tongue inside my mouth. I couldn't understand what was happening but I didn't care, it was a kiss I wanted right back. I started kissing her back, but she backed away and moved to her computer. I was stunned, but she said again and again that she knew exactly what I was thinking of. This went on for a few hours and it seemed like we were soul mates. After about an hour or so, I felt the urge to reach out and touch her, but in that moment her hand went to my shoulder and I didn't resist, so naturally she started to unbutton my shirt and I didn't even protest. All I could think of was how much I wanted her to touch me.</p> <p>When she was done and she had the bra off, it was at that point I knew I was ready to go again. I reached up to the waistband of her shorts to push them down. Once the shorts were all the way down and her panties were gone and she was standing right in front of me, I just knew we were going to make love.</p> <p>She broke the silence as she whispered to me that she wasn't ready. With that our kiss finally broke and I could see in her eyes how much pressure and excitement that had been building within herself. It was a look of total ecstasy and it showed what was in her eyes. We weren't really into it at that time, but it wasn't hard to see that she was still a bit hesitant.</p> <p>It did arouse me a little more though. She kept talking quietly to me as she ran her fingers through my hair again (the whole time our mouths were still locked together). I was more curious to know what her reaction would be to what I was doing. I knew it would be all different than what I had experienced before, but that feeling of a connection we once shared grew stronger. I could still feel her hands on my shoulders and it just fueled it. As her body started to come closer to me she put a hand on my face and gave me that same smile. I was breathing deeply as I was now looking directly into her eyes.</p> <p>"Baby, are you serious?"</p> <p>She looked so calm as she smiled and continued to look me straight in the eyes as we kissed. We began to kiss again after several minutes of intense making out. Her soft lips parted as we shared each other's mouths and I felt her tongue slide inside. We made out for a few more minutes when I started to realize that she was about to take off my shirt. I was a bit hesitant, but I couldn't resist and pulled her into me, my hands began to lightly trace her back while I felt her start to massage my chest. After a few seconds of this, I was starting to think of her as a sexual being, and it made me feel safe and loved by what she saw as a person. She started to unbutton my shirt as I continued to kiss her. I had never been completely naked before and was hesitant but I wasn't going to let myself be too embarrassed. I wanted her so much and had wanted to do this for so long, but didn't want to seem like I was something I couldn't get out of my pants.</p> <p>She was wearing a black bra underneath, and as it came off, I could feel my desire to be seen. I wanted to keep looking at her, so I reached down and lifted her up by her thighs and I laid her back down on the couch. After a few minutes of kissing, I was able to reach underneath her skirt and I slowly removed it as I lay beside her.
