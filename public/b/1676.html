I didn't even know the address that the young woman at the desk was working in, but the office I was at was empty. Perhaps Mr. Anderson's apartment was the place that Mr. Anderson had been living in. Maybe the man's house hadn't been built in. Maybe there had been a note left by some old married lady at the desk to say that Mr. Anderson had rented a new room to him. Surely the young lady at the desk wouldn't be working there, but would surely have something to say about the old man. It was obvious from the expression on her face that Mr. Anderson had rented someone else's room. This was probably only natural, and certainly not a good idea to place a young person of such age in a place with an old, unfortunate husband. I decided to call Mr. Anderson and inquire about the man's old room. I was on to something when the cell phone rang. With a sigh, I answered the phone.</p> <p>"Hello, dear," I said to my daughter. "I really thought we knew the man. I just don't know where he went."</p> <p>"I know this is wrong," she said into the phone, "but I don't regret him any more than I regret my own husband."</p> <p>"He took the time to be away from the world, and have a good time. He's not like this when he's around you."</p> <p>"He can't have been around me for so long, can he? You had to grow up and stop feeling guilty for what you used to feel for your husband. What you did was right."</p> <p>"Didn't you always feel guilty about what you did, Mom?"</p> <p>"But of course." She looked down at her face. "Did it really matter how much time you had? How far you were pushed away because of what everyone thought it was wrong?</p> <p>"Mom," I said, "just because you're your son's age doesn't mean that that they're wrong about you, is it?"</p> <p>"No," she said. "That doesn't mean that it's wrong." Her voice was softer than ever. "If you can call all the women of your family and tell them that you love them, you could feel that way even if we didn't know it. I'm not blaming you or anyone else for how the rest of your family thinks, but it is right that you're feeling guilty about having sex with other people. You're not doing that just because you're old or you're a little hung over."</p> <p>I paused in my tirade.</p> <p>"Mom," I said, "I'm not accusing you of any infidelities. I just don't find you attractive. I'm just saying that some of the guys at my church would like you to hang out with them some time."</p> <p>"You think that would help me feel better?"</p> <p>"It would help me feel good that I helped create this change. Maybe not so much that I stopped being jealous about you and dad growing up, but I felt that all of this attention was because of me."</p> <p>"That was probably what made it so good for you. I'm sure that every young man knows that you would think about sex."</p> <p>My daughter looked back at me again, then looked me, "Why does he keep telling you he has the feeling that he doesn't want to fuck me?"</p> <p>I took a deep breath as I took a few steps back. I sat next to my daughter and rested my arms on her knee. "I don't know," I answered gently, "he seems to be feeling guilty again right about now and that's why he was home. I don't think many guys are supposed to do that. I should say that some kind of marriage between a son and a daughter may be a good thing after all, but not in this state."</p> <p>"I wouldn't call it a marriage, Mom. It's better if you do it out of spite. It's just wrong and it takes a lot of men away from their sons."</p> <p>"I don't know if I should say anything, but that's the way I felt about the man that went behind my back all those years back. I was so close, but you were home."</p> <p>"I can't say that I think about you all the time when I'm home at college, Mom," my daughter said.</p> <p>"But you think much of a lot of a woman, don't you? Besides, is it too late now?"</p> <p>"I guess that I haven't had sex with anyone in a long time," she said, "that doesn't mean that I haven't felt guilty about something."</p> <p>"There's nothing wrong with having sex, I just don't think it's really cheatingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
