I'm famished" "Mmmmmm!" came the reply.</p> <p>They carried on with their normal banter as they each finished the last of the wine and cleared away, leaving only each other behind to eat and relax.</p> <p>After the wine was done they decided to order some food from the buffet table and enjoy a drink at their favourite pub before going home. They had their meal, sat eating their meals, chatting and joking and eventually, just like before, the wine started to wear off. They were still chatting and joking, they'd had enough of the conversation so it was time for bed. They both wanted to do nothing else else than spoon themselves down in the bed together but, before they got up to go to the bathroom, Linda stopped herself.</p> <p>"Oh no!" she said firmly. "You're getting up to something. I'm up here and you're up to something."</p> <p>She turned back into her favourite place. It was her favourite bed. She'd taken her nightie off so as to not cause herself any suspicion of being caught or caught with a light on. It was so relaxing and luxurious that as soon as she started to get out of bed, she would have fallen asleep with a warm sensation between her legs. That feeling, that feeling between her legs! It sent waves of pleasure through her as she lay in the middle of her bed, just feeling the pressure between her legs and that feeling was making her wetter and wetter.</p> <p>She just lay there, just waiting for whatever was going to happen as, with the lights of the room suddenly going out. As it was, she could hear Linda's breathing and could even feel the breeze on her. When at last the bedroom door finally opened and she found herself in Linda's bed, her head was resting on the pillow as she tried to find the source of her new partner of love.</p> <p>She didn't know that she was holding out as long as she might, but somehow her body responded to Linda's touch and then Linda's as they slowly rolled onto their side with her on her side and her head on Linda's right shoulder. When they had all of themselves under control they got up on their knees and, with the knowledge that there was no way they should start again, they both got into position. Their heads found Linda's shoulder as she leaned on her left elbow with her head on her left shoulder. They kissed again, long and gently, their bodies moving together as they both felt the other's mouth on their cheeks and hair.</p> <p>Their tongues danced with each other and the feeling of the other's skin on theirs. There was no finesse to it other than what it was, it really was just sex and it was. The moment their mouths broke apart and they turned their heads to each other and, as they both turned to speak, the words just slid right down each others throat without even being said. "I've wanted you too, ever since we started having sex. I'm so sorry if..." she choked on the words as she had never said to anyone. "I'm so sorry that it was wrong and-" she looked at her. "I've just never asked for or expected anything else. I've just been used, abused and -" she looked at her again. "I had to have you, now. If it was your idea, then I..."</p> <p>The only thing that mattered was that she had loved, had loved and had been loved all her life, but how could anyone else love her in that way? There was no one but themselves that she had wanted to be with. No one but herself as she had been since that day started. And even if she hadn't wanted to admit it or try to tell herself to stop, she had found herself trying not to have those feelings for anyone else. She found herself wondering if the things she had done in front of her had just been a game to see where things would go, or if she could change them if she felt she couldn't, but just how quickly there were changes happening after all this time.</p> <p>So she wanted this and she could almost see himself wanting that too, if only this once, just to just see this again. She was, at that moment, so utterly in love with her Linda was so close to her that there was no question how she could be for anyone else but herself.</p> <p>She felt the kiss of that kiss and she felt her heart flutter just as rapidly as hers, more than that and even more so. She felt her body being pressed onto the bed as she felt a little movement, just as there was a little motion with her head and it was definitely just to her. She just felt forlornly close to this person, a lover in need of her but in need of someone else as well, someone to cherish and who really caredâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
