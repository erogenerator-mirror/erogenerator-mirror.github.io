"Don't say it. That would be silly."</p> <p>He grinned again. "We have all night. We've got our priorities straight and clean."</p> <p>"What do I do?"</p> <p>"I've got a list of stuff to do when I get done, but only from this point on," he told her. "If anything goes wrong... that I may want..."</p> <p>"What," Amanda said, looking aghast. "What do you mean by 'is this what this means?'?"</p> <p>Scott nodded. "It's how everyone works together, isn't it?" He smiled. "What you get is nothing but pleasure, and nothing more. Everything is a part of your life, and when you go off the grid you won't have a time to spend with anyone but yourself!" He said with a laugh. "You have fun too!"</p> <p>Amanda looked at him with a puzzled expression on her face. "You," she asked with another question. "Don't you think you should... you've done enough..."</p> <p>Scott grinned again. "You should get on with it. Have a good time."</p> <p>He felt her smile, just as he'd felt it earlier, and then gave her a playful squeeze. She put her arms around his neck and kissed him on the lips. He had no idea how to respond or enjoy her in the way she did. But he leaned down and gave her a quick peck.</p> <p>"Hey, that's a pretty good start!" he told her. "Now, how about a quick lesson before we get started?"</p> <p>"Ooh, yes," she giggled to him. "But where's the fun in that?"</p> <p>Scott sighed. He had wanted to start something special with Amanda; there was a reason that sex was an important part of his existence. Sex was a part of it. It had nothing to do with Amanda and the things she did that made him feel special, and that wasn't to say sex was out of the question. As long as he could just have Amanda, he probably would, and the sex wouldn't really be too uncomfortable after all. No matter how much her sexual proclivities had become to him; it hadn't mattered how intense his enjoyment was with her.</p> <p>Instead, they had been left with awkward, lingering awkwardness until now. He could tell by the look on her face that she was considering it more than just a quickie.</p> <p>"Oh, I don't have all night," she replied with a smirk. "I'm tired, though," she told him. "Not to mention, it's a little late for some fun!"</p> <p>"Sure," Scott said in reply. He leaned her back against the headboard, pulling her closer and running his hands around her hips, before pulling himself to her and kissing her full on the mouth. They kissed for nearly a minute, just catching their breath as they enjoyed each other's mouth.</p> <p>He could feel her body against him and his heartbeat quickening as she pressed her body against his. He broke the kiss to pull her into his arms.</p> <p>"Sorry," he said softly. "Is that a problem?"</p> <p>Amanda nodded. Although much of her clothing seemed to have been lost from her dress now, she was naked underneath it: the rest of her was just as open as before. She put one arm around his neck and the other rested around his waist as they kissed passionately. After a minute, she kissed his cheek. "It's fine," she told him. "Just... hold on a while longer."</p> <p>After a few moments, she broke the kiss and began to unbutton his shirt. As she pulled it off, Scott reached behind to cup a breast and massage it softly before kissing the nipple again. He could feel her chest heave as she became more and more excited, and he could feel her breath quicken. The sight of that excited him immensely, and it made him even hotter. He lifted her onto the bed, and as he lay on top of her, she guided his cock in between her legs and slowly guided it into her.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," she sighed to him. "Fuck me!"</p> <p>Scott grinned. "I thought we were going to do this from this bed."</p> <p>"Mhmm," she said with a giggle. "The bed's not that short. We don't have all night, after all." Before she could finish her sentence, Scott was fully in her. The bed was big enough for just both of them, and it felt really good to her now. For her part, she was lost in the sensation of his cock, which felt so good between her legs. It felt like he was inside of her, rather than stretching her.</p> <p>Scottâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
