All I knew was that something was still a step away from going back there with her and the consequences of this would be too harsh to contemplate.</p> <p>I leaned in to hug her as a tear trickled down I just couldn't help it. I squeezed her tightly and said, "Karen, I was so angry with you earlier and now I want us to be really honest."</p> <p>Karen's hand covered mine and she said, "I know baby, but we have to do this quickly and with some urgency."</p> <p>She wrapped her arms around me and pulled us close to each other and said, "We better do that and get our shit together right now before I leave."</p> <p>I looked up into her eyes and just said, "We have to plan our moves now and be ready when we do everything."</p> <p>Karen kissed me on the lips and said, "I want us to be together as often as we can manage."</p> <p>I nodded and she looked at me and smiled and said, "Yes I will."</p> <p>I leaned over and rested my head on her shoulder and said, "We can't be with just my folks,"</p> <p>Karen giggled and squeezed me tighter and said, "I know, but I don't want to be left out. Please be my good man, I'm so excited."</p> <p>We slowly walked the rest of the way back to the truck and I let her slip inside the truck and I opened the door for her and said, "I'll be in the front, you just sit there for a moment."</p> <p>Karen jumped in and I was out in a flash and she sat in the cab and I sat in the seat facing the front. I pulled out the blanket and the bottle of wine and handed it to Karen. She took it and we went to a spot beside her.</p> <p>Karen took my hand and said, "Baby, you're already feeling much better now. You and I both know that we could never get it back."</p> <p>I looked at her and kissed her nose saying, "You're the only thing I want right now, you're the only thing I love about you and now you have made me love you."</p> <p>She smiled and gently put her hands on my back and leaned over and kissed me and said, "Okay, I'll never deny the love you are giving me and when you're with me I want you to know that I'm with you, in every way."</p> <p>I looked into her eyes again and she continued, "We need to figure out a way to make you happy, baby brother."</p> <p>I looked at her again and said, "You want me to be happy and to feel happy and to love you too, huh, Karen?"</p> <p>She smiled and replied, "You're right, I do want you love me because I love you and because of our relationship, but I want to make you happy to say it. I love you, I love you, I love to be with you," and she kissed my lips hard saying, "Please me, I love you."</p> <p>I grinned and then kissed her again and said, "I love you, too."</p> <p>I reached down and gently touched her breast with the tip of my finger and said, "I know honey, you probably think you can't get me aroused enough to do it again, but you're right."</p> <p>I grinned and said, "I can't get you aroused enough not to make love to you again, that is if you want me to."</p> <p>She just gave a huge smile and said, "I do love you so much. You're the first one to ever do anything like that and maybe the last."</p> <p>I reached over to the nightstand and picked up a bottle of lotion that was laid out on the floor. I looked at Karen and said, "Baby, what are we waiting for?"</p> <p>She smiled and said, "I've got a present for you."</p> <p>I kissed her on the lips and smiled down and said, "I'll be right back, baby."</p> <p>I got up and took my pants and shoes off and walked to the back of the truck and sat on the tailgate. I got a fresh washcloth and dried it off. I got down on my knees and took her knees and lifted her legs up to my shoulders and I started the water and got down on my knees and worked the lotion in with my mouth and hands and massaged her thighs and feet.</p> <p>Karen held my head tightly against her pussy and pushed it into her pussy and I moved in and sucked on her clit and used the whole of my mouth and tongue to make a wonderful meal of sex. She began to moan and hump my mouth and it felt so good.
