Go get her ready for me. Come back whenever you're ready," Alex says with a big grin on his face.</p> <p>As he stands up to go get his shirt, Mike quickly stops him.</p> <p>"Wait. We're on a date and I'd love to do this again. But now just so we can get to a point where we don't have a problem," Mike says with a big smile on his face.</p> <p>"I understand. I really want to."</p> <p>"I know you do. And I just wanted you to think a little bit about a couple of things right now," Alex says with a big smile.</p> <p>As he walks to get his shirt, Mike takes a quick glance back and sees that he's gone. His heart starts to skip a bit as he runs back to the office for her bra in the small cabinet nearby. His stomach is doing flip-flops and his cheeks are feeling a bit flushed.</p> <p>"So...are you just going to stand there or do you want to move on to something else right then?" Mike ask with a smile.</p> <p>Alex walks over and drops his pants and boxers leaving him naked and on a small kitchen floor. Mike walks over and takes Alex in his arms.</p> <p>"Do you feel better now?" he says slowly moving his lips against hers.</p> <p>"Oh yes."</p> <p>"Then go. Do not stop. Tell her how much you think about it. She will love you for letting her be with another woman."</p> <p>"I will do whatever you say." Alex says with a mischievous grin on his face.</p> <p>"Ok, I guess. As long as you know that I really want to do this," Alex says with a naughty smile, as he stands up and walks back to her.</p> <p>"I'm really looking forward to it," Alex says with a sweet and loving smile.</p> <p>"Good. I know you're ok with this, but I'm kind of nervous because I don't really know what it will feel like. If you don't want it, you have to make it happen. I only want you to think this through and then I want you to let go. I know that's hard to do at first, since you still haven't given that any credence yet," she says with a smirk.</p> <p>Mike looks to Alex for any clue as how to proceed.</p> <p>"Ok, so...what is really going on?" he asks.</p> <p>Mike leans back to watch as Alex moves her body forward, sitting on the counter in front of Mike's chair and begins to unbuckle his jeans. "I'm glad you're going to let me take care of that," she says leaning back and moving a foot to spread her legs just a little. "Here goes nothing."</p> <p>She guides Mike's large hand along her leg and down to her knee. As Mike continues to move his hand slowly back up, Alex gets ready and starts to stroke away. Mike could feel how wet she has become and as Mike's hand starts to stroke up, he could feel her rubbing her thighs and calves. Alex's breathing quickens and her breast are pushing forward and up with each movement. Alex's eyes are closed as she lets out a soft moan and slides her hands forward and down her own body, feeling the thin fabric of her tank top and bra as her breathing quickens even more.</p> <p>"That feels wonderful," she says as her hands start to move on themselves. "I hope everything is ok. Can I touch?" she asks.</p> <p>Mike feels a small shudder and his back straightens just a little. He's almost there now and he can't wait until the first time she'll let him feel what real physical contact is. Alex starts to move her legs a bit and Mike's breathing quickens.</p> <p>"I'll let you touch but not too close. Just keep moving. Keep going," she whispers.</p> <p>Mike continues to stroke the upper part of her legs as she leans forward and puts one of her hands flat on the counter. Her other hand starts to tease on her breast and Mike can feel a soft spot she had a lot of success finding. His mind is on the sensation of touching Alex and this makes Mike's cock strain against his boxers and his balls start to tingle as he watches her. She's starting to move downâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
