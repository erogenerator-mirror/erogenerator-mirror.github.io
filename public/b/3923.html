You snicker. No, I'm all for it. You take a chance, I guess.</p> <p>"You'd better get started" I say, still giggling. I slide into position, leaning back against you. My hand comes up and strokes my pussy as I reach between my legs and rub my clit. I close my eyes and moan in pleasure. Slowly, your fingers slide in and out of my pussy, your thumb sliding up to my clit. Your thumb moves in circles over it as your finger presses on my g-spot. I'm getting close again. You pull your head away from me for a moment. I groan out loud.</p> <p>"You sure do have a lot of stamina" You say as you grab my hips and roll me over. I'm not sure I can do it as my face turns redder with pleasure. With that, you slide your cock into my pussy, pulling out until I'm afraid you're going to hit my cervix. I feel so full. My nails can't stay long like that. Your cock is so thick in me. It's a pleasure unlike anything I've ever felt before. You slide in and out with long, strong strokes. You start picking up speed as I reach between my legs and start fingering my clit.</p> <p>I'm losing myself in the feeling of your cock rubbing across my g-spot. You pick up the pace and soon I'm on the verge of another orgasm. You're not going to be far behind. I can feel my walls tightening around you, wanting more. Knowing that I might be out of control makes it that much harder for me to control myself. I'm so close, close to the edge. "Oh, fuck," I whimper as I explode under your thrusting cock. I'm just about there.</p> <p>You pull out of me, and then you move up onto the bed next to me. You lift me onto your lap, and grab one of my breasts and roll onto me. I kiss your chin and lick your ear.</p> <p>"Ready"</p> <p>"Mmmmm"</p> <p>As you kiss me I start grinding myself on your cock again. You reach your hands around me and start teasing my clit. I'm cumming once more for you. "Not yet" You say as you pull your cock from my pussy. I turn onto my side facing you. My breasts jiggle, I reach out and grab your cock, rubbing the head back and forth against my pussy lips. I slip a finger into my pussy and start the slow, steady pace of fucking myself. My hips thrust hard back and forth as I start to grind my clit into the base of your cock. Your cock twitches as it slips against it. I look up at you and see a light dawning in your eyes. You kiss me.</p> <p>"I want you now!" He says, leaning over to kiss me deeply.</p> <p>"Fuck me" I say, taking his cock back in my hand and rubbing your head against my pussy. As I slowly press on him I can feel the ridge of your cock head start to rub against my cervix. You put your arm around me and lift me off of you. As you do I get on my knees, looking at your cock as I slide down and take you into my mouth. I bob my head up and down on your cock, taking your whole length in and out gently. I hear you groan. I look up to you.</p> <p>"You're going to make me cum!" You say, holding my hips as firmly as you can. My tongue flicks against your cock head as you push me back down and start fucking in and out slowly, my teeth clamping down as I try to resist sucking on you. I want to make you cum. You pull my hips to your, pushing down hard as your cock plunges deep into me. I feel it, you thrust up so hard against me, I scream out as you cum. I try to pull off of you but you hold me up, holding me as you fuck me. Just as I'm about to cum my body starts to tremble.</p> <p>"Cumming!" I scream as your cock thrust into my mouth as your cum shoots down my throat. You're still coming down as your cock starts to soften. My pussy starts to clench and spasm again as I orgasm around your shaft, squeezing your cock so tightly as it pulses and pulses inside of me. Your hips jerking against me. I'm still coming down.</p> <p>I'm still coming down. I'm not sure what the time is. I have no idea how much time has gone by. Time seems to be frozen in the same room as I have fallen right through my orgasm. I'm still rubbing your head, your cock, your pelvis. After what feels like an eternity, my hips start to move againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
