When we got there, it looked like almost everyone who was still in charge of the elevator was still there. He opened my pants and I helped him undress me. I felt like I was going to faint standing naked with him. I was scared. He had his pants undone and the zipper coming down. I knew he was as turned on as I would ever be. I felt a wave of excitement go through me. I couldn't believe it. When I was naked he threw me on the bed and went down on me while I took off my clothes. I didn't think of anything. I just enjoyed the feeling of his warm mouth on my cock. He seemed to know I was about to cum and he kept sucking me. After I came in his mouth I pulled off him and asked if I could be of any use to his little hole. He just looked around and asked if anyone was coming to visit us. I figured he said "no."</p> <p>Some of the guys said they were going to visit us on the other floor. I had some of them come back into the bar and we would spend the night together. We ended up staying in one of the rooms while they went up and up. I saw the guy who had gotten the room the one with the guy that had just been in the elevator. He got a big smile when he walked into the room. He said the girl he had just been in the elevator with was in there. He said that one of the guys she had been in the elevator last night was probably gone and asked her to come back. Her name was Susan. She had said something about the night going a little too well and asked if we could go there some night. He said that if she stayed the night she could stay the same room and he'd let her out of the apartment around six PM. That was the time it would all be over. I told her I would have no problem staying at that house.</p> <p>We sat at the table talking about what we would do on a trip that day and what we'd do tonight. It was really going to be a long day for them. I thought about going out to get dinner and get some drinks.</p> <p>"You think you can come up here and live here?" I asked. She looked back and said yes, "I thought of staying but I wasn't sure if you'd feel comfortable sharing us with the boys there."</p> <p>"So what do you think?" I asked.</p> <p>"It's great," she replied. "We'll get a few guys for that one. It's been three months since we've been there." She said that she'd loved the idea and would enjoy it even more if she could stay longer.</p> <p>"Can we come up next week?" I asked and she asked if I really wanted to go, but I told her no. I didn't want to have to make an unplanned trip with my new friends.</p> <p>There wasn't much that I'd like to do up here before I left. I wondered if this place would ever fit. A good thing that we hadn't been in here before too.</p> <p>To be continuedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
