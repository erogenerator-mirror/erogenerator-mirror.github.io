As he stepped off, she reached up and took his cock in her hand. "Let me make it all wet."</p> <p>He couldn't help saying, "A little more. Please?"</p> <p>She nodded, and stepped back to the door again. The sight of this cock with her hand wrapped around it almost made him drop his pants to the floor. She took the tip of it, and rubbed it hard and slow for all she was worth. When it went stiff in her hand, she took her eyes off it for a second, and began stroking it as hard as she could.</p> <p>Just because she was in her own world, doesn't mean she would do this to Mike for the rest of the night. But when it was her turn, he would too. She loved to touch herself while Mike fucked her -- he never failed to make her come.</p> <p>He moved closer to her. "Please don't stop. Don't ever stop."</p> <p>Now she was going crazy, and could hear Mike groan and felt his balls pull up slightly. She moved her hand over to his hip, and up. She could feel the shaft swell as she slid her hand over it. She pulled her hand back to its end. Then she took just the tip in her hand, and rubbed it up and down, in time with her stroking. It took her a couple of minutes to get Mike to come when she did, and her eyes closed.</p> <p>"Holy shit."</p> <p>Mike opened his eyes. "No shit?"</p> <p>"No. I've just been fucked. What if this happens again?"</p> <p>He smiled. "You don't think she'll say yes?"</p> <p>"No. What if she says no again?"</p> <p>He shrugged. "This is hard to say, huh? You really want to try?"</p> <p>"Yes. Yes I do. I just can't."</p> <p>"No?"</p> <p>"Oh God. If this happens again, tell me."</p> <p>"No. If not, tell me right now and I'll let you go free."</p> <p>His face lit up. "I'll do that. I'll show you again what you need." He turned and strode into the den. With his cock still in his hand, he turned to look Mike over. "Is she still up?" he asked and gave him a half smile.</p> <p>"Sure. What part of the house does she live in?"</p> <p>"The kitchen. The living room, with her clothes."</p> <p>"The living room?"</p> <p>"Yep. We'll watch a game."</p> <p>"Oh my God. That sounds so good. My wife, and my son in law. What would their families think?"</p> <p>Mike smiled and nodded. "I've got an idea. I want to see you naked again."</p> <p>"Naked again?"</p> <p>"Yup. When we're making love, you'll want to be nude all the time. No, it's a surprise."</p> <p>"Oh. Wow. I love your idea. I feel awkward but I'd so much like it, and that's what I'm trying to find out. Any way do it."</p> <p>"You're right, and I can't have her leave you this way. You'll have to try again."</p> <p>Mike stood at the edge of the bed, and moved over to join her. The head of his cock was in front of her face -- the tip slick with pre-cum. "Can you tell me what you think?"</p> <p>She stared at it, her cheeks rosy. "I like it. I like it so much."</p> <p>"I guess so."</p> <p>"I guess so, too. Here. Open your mouth and touch it with your tongue."</p> <p>"Oooh."</p> <p>He smiled. "This is really new. I never imagined it would feel this way."</p> <p>She smiled back. "It's okay to get excited. You'll love it."</p> <p>"I never thought doing this would turn you on."</p> <p>"It doesn't. Not for me anyway. And I've never done it for anyone."</p> <p>They talked for about five minutes then. She told her story when her husband walked in a few minutes later. The whole time, he had been sitting on the couch, taking stock of his work. When his wife came in to talk, Mike got up from the bed, and stood by the bed. "What are you doing?"</p> <p>"What is she up to? I haven't told my wife anything that I saw today. She just told me."</p> <p>He smiled. "That's right. That's the way I feel. You can touch me if you want."</p> <p>She nodded and leaned forward to take his cock in her mouth.
