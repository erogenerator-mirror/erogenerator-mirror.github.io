He wondered aloud.</p> <p>The secretary greeted him with a warm smile. She was as attractive as hell and more than handsome, in her own way.</p> <p>She was short and slender.</p> <p>When he noticed her, he was struck by how well her clothing fit her. Though she'd had a rather plain appearance that night, her tight figure looked even more so on the bed as she swayed her hips. He noticed that she had been wearing a loose fitting summer dress that she'd left over a month or so ago.</p> <p>"We don't expect you to know where you're going to go after work." Her deep gravely voice reminded him of his own wife's voice when he and his partner were working that way at the gym.</p> <p>"Don't worry, I'll take your word for it." He replied quickly.</p> <p>His wife, on the other hand, could easily get the whole store to go somewhere that night in a hurry.</p> <p>"I'm glad you came!" She smiled as if she were happy for him.</p> <p>As his wife put her things away and put out a small bottle of perfume that she was now only wearing when he was working, he smiled and walked out the door to go on his way.</p> <p>Chapter 14</p> <p>As he entered the back garden of a large two-story home, her breath caught and her face turned bright red as she recognized the smell of her husband's perfume.</p> <p>"How the... how am I going to get in if I'm a husband who doesn't know where he's going to go at this time of the day when I have to work? How am I going to be able to find a way to make him go away like this before the day is out."</p> <p>That had been the case for the last three days as she drove him out to find a suitable young man, while he drove her out at night.</p> <p>She'd come home and gone to the gym in her new dress, which was, if anything, just shorter and tighter around her than it did when she was at home.</p> <p>She came home with all kinds of things. Her new dress, a long, black stretch skirt and her new bra and panties all in place for the day. It was a lovely day for an early autumn as she had gone all day to the gym. She'd also gotten some sun lotion and some of her other things to wear under her dress before her date.</p> <p>Before they had entered her house, she'd stood for a couple minutes by the bathroom window and she hadn't even turned on the faucet, yet.</p> <p>When he arrived home from work, he'd taken her outside and asked her to come inside and change into something a bit more revealing, like a blouse, or a skirt. Although she had never worn a bra to work in his car, there she was, standing in the kitchen of a modest apartment trying to decide if she should dress up for his date.</p> <p>"There are some things upstairs that you need to pick up." She told him with a smile.</p> <p>He was taken aback by her forwardness, as he saw that her breasts and skirt had come off in such a short time. He'd expected a little more out of her tonight, that she'd change for him, but she was clearly nervous about going out in full-on attire.</p> <p>Even though he knew that it wouldn't do anything to make him want to take her out once she showed up and did what he felt was a good time. He'd come home, he'd fuck her, and then, if she was comfortable enough, he could make love to her some more, in a place where he could control her, without any of the emotional barriers.</p> <p>But he remembered that he was going to a business meeting that he'd be accompanying his wife to for the last time tonight. He'd left all of his money for their dinner, for their anniversary, and just as he'd been planning to pay her back the day after the divorce, he figured he'd probably have enough to go home himself, leaving a deposit that she would have to pay the bills if she refused to pay his bills.</p> <p>Now that she was here and he'd seen her, with him having been so close since he entered the home, he had no sense of direction anymore. He knew that it was likely that she'd never want to see him again, he thought.</p> <p>He put out his hand for her to take, but just as soon as he did, she walked away instead.</p> <p>Later that morning, as they sat at the kitchen table, he took her hand in his and looked at herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
