It's because I have so much desire that it's not too hard to take you. It's just what you want. It's just a little something we talk about at night."</p> <p>She nodded, smiling up as she spoke. "What was that, honey?"</p> <p>"It was something simple."</p> <p>"Oh." She shook her head.</p> <p>He kissed her forehead. "There was no hesitation. All that was in your eyes was curiosity and desire. You've never felt anything that way for us, never."</p> <p>"Oh, baby, that's incredible. Please don't do that again."</p> <p>"If you weren't my daughter, it would be impossible. We're both adults. Don't be afraid of us. Just trust us."</p> <p>"Wellllll... I guess I'm not sure," she said.</p> <p>"Trust me, baby," he assured her. "You're a very special young lady."</p> <p>"You can count on me to know how I'm doing." She kissed him in turn, licking his lip.</p> <p>His hand went to her waist once again, and when she stopped kissing him, he reached for the zip to her skirt.</p> <p>In a flash, she was standing in front of him, skirt and all. She turned her back to him, and he slid his hand inside the waistband of her panties. It was very warm to the touch, and when she gasped, he found it to be all too moist.</p> <p>She shivered, then put her hand down to his erection, which was already raging hard. He cupped her sex, which was hot and soaked. He slid one finger into the wet opening, but the girl was still surprised by the thick girth of his cock, which only made her need him more. His finger slid out, and he smeared it around her clitoris. She gasped when he rubbed it and his finger slid back in, wet against her sensitive spot. She pressed against him, taking the head of his cock in her hand.</p> <p>He teased a little, rubbing his member in circles.</p> <p>"Ohh... oh, God... please." Her eyes were closed in bliss, and she could feel every inch of him rub against her.</p> <p>"You're so wet," he groaned.</p> <p>"I never wanted anything so badly." She opened her eyes and met his gaze. "It felt so good..."</p> <p>He ran his fingers up and down her damp passage, and she moaned. She took his head in her hand and guided him inside. "Oh, honey... oh, god... I don't think I'm supposed to be doing this... it feels so... so... nice..."</p> <p>"Yes," he crooned. "It feels good..."</p> <p>She didn't, but he did. His eyes were closed as he slid into her, then closed once more as he pulled his fingers out. His hips were still grinding against hers as he slid back in, and she held onto him, guiding his cock into her. She was slick with their sex, and his hand was slick with her juices.</p> <p>It took all of his strength to hold himself in. He could hardly move, as the girl had placed him in the perfect position with himself stuffed in. Her wet and tight walls were so hot around him. She was so different than the women he'd fucked, and he had never had anyone that took his full weight. He didn't know if he was taking her at her most basic of places, or if he did it just right.</p> <p>His fingers traced her clit as she moved under him. When she suddenly grabbed him and came, she cried out, feeling him start to move within her. "I'm cumming, too! I'm cumm... Oh..." She shuddered and came again, squeezing him so that there was no way he was going to pull out of her just yet.</p> <p>When they came down from their climaxes, he withdrew his penis and took her hand. She slid herself up to sit on the edge of the bed, and he pulled her to him, kissing her passionately. "God, that was delicious. I can't get enough of you."</p> <p>She chuckled against his mouth. "You're a treasure," she exclaimed. "Just don't do something so fast."</p> <p>She reached to her tote bag, and fished around for her cell phone. He did the same, and she put down her hand. "Do not take my calls, please. Do not call the girls. If your father asks you to stay here, I'll have you out of doors."</p> <p>"I think you understand."</p> <p>She smiled. "Just think," she said.
