But it was wrong: I felt so full! I wanted to please him right now, he had me so hot my body was on fire!</p> <p>All he said to me was, “You are amazing!” and he started to move on me a little faster again. Soon the entire weight of his entire body was under me, and the feeling made me come so much he felt it too!</p> <p>It was just amazing! He had me at ease for a few moments, and then he slowly pulled out. The sudden absence of a penis caused me to be concerned, because of me cum, but I didn’t know what to do. When I did come I felt so satisfied it almost didn’t leave me. He made me feel better, and my body felt normal again. He told me to lick and suck his balls, which I did gladly, and I did, in fact I wanted more so badly if he wanted more? He wanted more and I just wanted his taste.</p> <p>But he wouldn’t let me. He pulled me roughly to my knees and I was so frightened that I said no to anything but him. But he didn’t say anything. With the knowledge that all I want he wanted was sex, I didn’t have to think about it, just be his sex pet!</p> <p>“Take off your dress and give it to me.”</p> <p>My legs were shaking all at the sight of this stranger with his cock out. I didn’t have a bra, I didn’t need one. He took my hand and led me to the bedroom. It was a room that was the same size as his, where we could get closer to each other. The furniture was quite nice, but it didn’t look like real furniture. We turned down the hall so we could talk, and there was a small door somewhere in the back of the room that had a small window in it. The window opened to a balcony window, and there were a few people moving about the garden, and in the garden all of them were naked. I just watched them for a moment, and then I saw him kiss me, and he was sucking on my tongue.</p> <p>My body responded to the sight of that, and soon all my clothes were off. I was lying on my back on the bed, his face on mine, his hands on my body, and he was between my legs. He kept looking into my eyes as he ate me, his body just right for sucking on my clit, my inner thighs, and my pussy. He had a cock, it really was an amazing one, and he was sliding his whole body and it felt so good inside me. He lifted me up on the bed and kissed all of my body, my breasts and my nipples, my stomach, my pussy… it made me want to cum, and he was making me want my orgasm. When he started to eat my body again I came. He licked my pussy, it was so hot and so wet, and it felt so good the first time. He was like my boyfriend! And then he started to finger my pussy!</p> <p>I was so turned on, I couldn’t control myself! His fingers came in very short order and I was so wet it wasn’t hard for him to slide all his fingers in my pussy, to get himself close to me. He then went in and out of me in a fast rhythm, he didn’t want to move inside me. I asked for more, and he just kept going but I didn’t give it to him. He came a few minutes later and then I felt the cold and the hot on my skin. The heat felt like an ocean breeze through my whole body!</p> <p>“Please don’t stop,” I begged, and that made all of his body happy and he gave me another chance to change my mind. I saw his body as it moved and made a hard-on! He slowly put me beside him, just so, and he slowly kissed his way down on my body to my pussy. I felt the cold on my pussy: it was very hot and very wet. All the time he was kissing me, it felt right to keep the heat on, and so hot his kisses made me all the warmer. Soon he gave me a blowjob, and I had to hold his head to me. His tongue was too much of a distraction, I wanted him more, and I got my legs over his shoulders to get better access. He licked me from the side, the side above my clit, up from my stomach and to my stomach again. I held his head and tried to pull him on me, but he stopped, making me beg a bit. Then he went on my stomach and then my pussy—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
