And for you, I don't know what's got into me!"</p> <p>"I've got something better in mind for you."</p> <p>"And I hope you like me," I said, "I like you." My head swam at the thought. But she was talking more about my penis, now, and I needed to hear what she had to tell me. It was almost as if an answer to everything that was, to be sure, completely true, the truth. I wanted to, no I needed to hear it.</p> <p>"Yes," I said.</p> <p>"Tell me what you like, David. Don't be shy about it, because we both know you've given me a lot of very good feedback. And you really didn't waste any time explaining what you really like or what you would like to try. How do you feel about my blowjob?"</p> <p>"Ooooh, you're dirty!" I gasped.</p> <p>"I'll have to think about it for a while."</p> <p>"I don't know what to say! I've been thinking about it for weeks!"</p> <p>"I want to show you!"</p> <p>"What about me?"</p> <p>"I need to give you pleasure!" I said.</p> <p>"How do you want to give me pleasure?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don't know. How about I show you how I like it."</p> <p>"That sounds so wonderful!" I could barely say it.</p> <p>"And you can help me."</p> <p>I had to say it first, because the whole thing took over too much of my thoughts. And I just wasn't as brave as I had been. But all of a sudden that idea struck with both a thrill and a dread. "I can't do that!" I said, "I can't..."</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she said, "but you have to admit that you liked being my first. You have to admit you like it." I nodded nervously. "Now that you know, you can show me what you enjoyed doing this afternoon. Come by back at one o'clock."</p> <p>*</p> <p>When I arrived at Helen's place, the house was completely deserted, except for a couple of cars parked there. I knocked on the door and Helen answered the door. When she saw me, she smiled and said,</p> <p>"Let me in."</p> <p>"No, no, let me in quickly. I feel like I am intruding, and I can wait."</p> <p>She took the first step before I had an opportunity. She moved closer, and we embraced. Her arms went around my neck, and we kissed. It was a soft one, gentle yet passionate. But no tongue. Not a tongue with a taste of a woman's saliva. But that kind of tongue could be, in my case. It was not a woman's tongue, but that kind of tongue you use to wash the wound out of your mouth by a man. But that kind of tongue was not one you used, for it would not have come to the surface of that tongue with only a single action. It did not seek to taste. It did not beg for anything from you. It just wanted to come to you. The kind of tongue that is so unlike the kind that's not yours could not be mine and not be yours. Was that the kind you really wanted? Of course you wanted it, but you couldn't feel it for yourself, not though. You could. Helen could feel how hard I was for her. So could she. But she still did not want to be inside in my arms. I reached down and tried to rub her again. But she pulled back, and said,</p> <p>"Go on, David, let's get a drink together." I smiled, got a beer, and followed her.</p> <p>*</p> <p>We went to the lounge, where there were a couple of lounge chairs and a TV on the TV. Not my idea, but what was handy is that the TV was on. She sat on one, took the beer bottle with her and we sat there. Then she put her arm around me and we kissed again. It was an almost erotic, sweet and erotic kiss. I caressed her cheek, then her neck. I was thinking about how it felt inside my own hand, inside her blouse and my fingers, inside her bra, inside those sweet little brasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
