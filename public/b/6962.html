"Come with me," I said.</p> <p>We went to her house, and parked next to the door. We held hands across the door, and I helped her up the steps. As we walked, I felt the warmth of her body under the thin tassel top, with the slight dampness in the hair. It felt wonderful! The thought of where we were going made me feel light to me, and not just because we had gotten away from home, but because we had both been so frightened of getting caught, as a result of our first encounter. We went up three flights of stairs into her house, and I led her to her bedroom. Once there she closed the door and turned to face me. She was all of 5' 3" tall, with long blonde hair, blue eyes staring me in the face. It took every ounce of my strength to resist the urge to kiss her.</p> <p>"Let's see what you've got." I pulled her t-shirt off, and I saw her firm, round breasts before my eyes. She was wearing a pair of loose slacks, so I pulled them off, and then I dropped my own clothing. She stepped right up against me, and I reached up and pulled her into me in a crushing hug. She broke off for a moment, and said, "That hurt." I said, "You didn't let go did you?" She shook her head, still in my embrace, "No, not much."</p> <p>"I can understand," I said as I began to unbuckle my belt.</p> <p>"You're gonna be in for it later." I pulled her up against me, and said "I think I'm going to take a shower, just to let you settle." As she followed me through the doorway, she looked at me, and smiled. "I hope you have a bathroom just for me tonight."</p> <p>"Hm! Yeah, I do."</p> <p>I went into the bathroom, and told her to get her clothes on, and I'd meet her in the hallway outside the bathroom in about ten minutes, which was about 15 minutes away. She was still standing by the door, looking at my bedroom door. While she did that, I undid my belt, slid my jeans off, then my boxers. I was already excited! I felt an overwhelming sense of relief, realizing that she would be back there to enjoy some of my kinky stuff tonight. But, then she came rushing in! She had this big smile on her face! All we could say to that was "damn"!</p> <p>"My door is always open! Here," I grabbed her hand and lead her to the hallway. "On your way, babe."</p> <p>I opened the bathroom door, and she entered in a hurry! As she moved past me, I pulled her into my body, and started kissing her. As we kissed, my hands found her nipples again, and then the inside of her thighs. She broke the kiss, and reached down to touch her pussy. As I took that first step, she began to moan, and I slid a finger inside her folds. She reached down with her hand, and pulled my finger out before I could penetrate her. "Mmm, I like that!" she said. I pulled her hand away, and then began kissing her again. I slid a finger inside her folds again, and rubbed her clit, and she began to moan again, then push back into my hand.</p> <p>"That's a good girl," I said. "And, we still got five minutes before Jenna gets to fuck you. That's what you wanted to say," I said, as I slowly pulled my fingers from her pussy. She was still a little wet now, and she pulled her hand from me and then pulled me toward her. We kissed again, as we moved from one room to another.</p> <p>She broke free, and told me to get on the bed. Before I did, we got each other's clothes off, and fell on it with her. She lifted me, facing her, with her knees next to my hips, and kissed me long and hard. We started off slow, with first the right, and then the left breast, rubbing the erect nipples together. After a while, she started to make love to my breasts with her tongue, while I ran the fingers of both hands over her nipples. We got into the sixty-nine at last, and she started to work her hand back and forth between my legs. It felt so good, to have someone else there to pleasure me so totally right next to me, who had been my first lover, and I was the first to have sex with a woman. We really went at it for a long time, until I started to feel faint from excitement. And I pulled apart for a moment, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
