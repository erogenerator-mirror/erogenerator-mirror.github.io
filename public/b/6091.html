Maybe she just wanted some sort of sexual release. I had no idea how to reply.</p> <p>“I don’t know if I should ever find out.” I responded sheepishly.</p> <p>“I wouldn’t ever tell anyone about this.” She started to move from her seat. “But I have to confess that I love sex. I don’t want anyone else to feel inadequate about that. Besides, you can’t hold back for too long too bad. I will probably be more comfortable if you do.”</p> <p>With that, Mary walked to the center of the living room. She removed her jeans and stood there totally naked.</p> <p>“So, are you ready for some sex now? Go over and sit down and let me watch you masturbate right next to me,” she said.</p> <p>I sat down right next to her. She unzipped my jeans and pulled out my already stiff member. She leaned over and kissed my dick right on her lips. My dick was still in her mouth and I felt myself getting harder. She slowly, and so gently, began sucking the tip and licking the shaft. As the saliva from her mouth ran down into my pubic area, she began moaning slightly. She would lick me about about a half inch and kiss the tip of my cock as it passed between her lips. When we separated for a moment, she said, “I love sucking your cock. I can’t believe you still come so much after such a long time!” and started to slide her lips up and down my dick. I tried to concentrate on the movie that we were watching but she kept going. “What’s the matter with you? That feels so good! Don’t you want to make love!” she said as she put a finger to my lips to indicate she was talking to me. I just nodded. This woman was really going to make me happy!</p> <p>I couldn’t help but tell her how much she had meant what she said about me being her partner. She looked me straight in the eyes and said, “You can touch her if you want too!”</p> <p>I immediately thought of her hand on mine there, her words against mine. I slid my hand down her body until I was cupping her pussy, her lips just barely touching her finger tips. I placed her finger tips gently on her nipples and gave one a squeeze. Then, I placed the tip of my tongue on the tip of her finger and gently began sucking it. Her response was that of her own finger. I felt her legs part slightly and I slid my tongue into her cleft and gently bit her clit. I felt her tense slightly and then relax as I began to lap the tip of her finger. I moved my mouth over her finger and felt it gently caressing my tongue, as my tongue slipped into her pussy. She began to breathe more easily as I did this.</p> <p>Mary was a very passionate woman. I guess that is why she had made me promise not to make any noise while making out. I felt Mary’s hand gently caressing my dick, occasionally reaching between my legs to rub me through my underwear.</p> <p>I felt her free hand slip under my shirt, and gently caress my balls. Then, she quickly unfastened my jeans and slid them down my legs. I stood there for a moment allowing her to undress me. The feeling of her hand caressing my cock was wonderful and I was feeling a strong tingle in my balls. I stood there for a minute, enjoying the feeling.</p> <p>Mary reached up and unbuttoned the first button of my shirt. She pulled it off of me and slowly slid my shirt off, as well as dropping it to the floor. Our eyes locked in a lustful gaze. We looked at each other for a while. Her hand on my chest, her lips on my chin, her bare breasts under my clothes, my hands caressing her body, exploring it. Then, her head began to move downward.</p> <p>“Honey” she began, “I just wanted to see if you’d like to touch me again. I want to feel you inside me.”</p> <p>My dick was already hard but standing proudly under her dress. I knelt down and began caressing her thighs. Her skin was surprisingly soft and velvety.</p> <p>“I’m a virgin,” she said in a soft whisper. “Don’t even think about giving me your cherry—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
