This is a lot different from what we usually do. We're just going to try it and what happens is up to the individual."</p> <p>"I can guess. Is it OK if we just go to the bathroom?"</p> <p>"It doesn't have to be for me to do anything, but if you're more uncomfortable and if I go too slow there, that's OK."</p> <p>"I have no problem with that."</p> <p>It's the first time that we've ever let the camera in and she was standing there staring at it, as though she was waiting for an answer. That's the kind of look I get when I like to see some detail. This time was no different.</p> <p>"It feels kinda weird to take your clothes off now, but if you need to..."</p> <p>"I'm good. It just feels weird doing it. It feels weird to get myself naked in front of you. There's nothing wrong with it in this kind of a situation."</p> <p>"I don't know what you're asking for. We're just getting started."</p> <p>"We've gone a little farther with each other already and I'm sure I won't be complaining, but I think we need to go someplace that'll be fun and to have a good time."</p> <p>A girl walked in the door and said, "Hey. Thanks for the help in getting the stuff out this weekend. I hope we don't get in the way of our first time here. I'm so glad you'll join us."</p> <p>"I'll try."</p> <p>We left about four in the morning and decided the fun wouldn't hurt for a while. I picked up some of the stuff, took it back to the room and went directly back to the bathroom. By then I had almost all of my clothes off and had taken a shower. I made sure the water was nice and cold and sat down, getting my clothes off. By the time I finished, it was around ten or eleven. I got dressed and was about to go back to the room when he walked in. I stopped him and said, "Thanks again for letting us come," as he walked in.</p> <p>"I wanted to be extra nice to you today, Mr."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm so glad you came. I think you're looking pretty good yourself."</p> <p>"Thanks. I don't know about Mr. Jorina, but I'm feeling pretty relaxed and ready to be here."</p> <p>"Come in and sit on the bed and I'll make us the breakfast. We'd like nothing more than just some fresh air in the morning."</p> <p>"Can I start for you? I'm starving."</p> <p>"We'll save that for later. Right now, I'd like more coffee."</p> <p>I went and got a cup and came back with two small cups and a plate of breakfast. I put the plates in the sink and added a little mocha to the water. The aroma of cinnamon and hot sausage sausage wafted through the room.</p> <p>I sat down in one of the chairs and asked, "How does it feel to be on your feet again?"</p> <p>He laughed and said, "I haven't changed my mind about that since it started. Your feet feel nicer. I was just thinking out loud."</p> <p>I didn't answer him, just held out my hand like I was going to say something. I think he took the chance that by saying something to get his mind off the idea that it was actually time to start taking his shoes off and get to work. As it was, our conversation seemed to linger a little longer than it had because all I heard was, "Well, at least you're not walking around naked."</p> <p>"Oh. I'm not. I just think I should wear the other clothes."</p> <p>"Come on, you don't have to go. I've been doing this a lot longer than you. How about you show me your butt then?"</p> <p>"It's OK, really. It's the least I can do. I've had lots of guys like that, and a lot of girls and lots of men."</p> <p>"I still don't know what's going on with you but it's all about how it feels to have a big dick up your butt."</p> <p>"Don't be so sure. I've never had a guy do that before. I guess I can get used to it. Let me up and I'll prove it to you."</p> <p>"That would be a first."</p> <p>After a nice breakfast and coffee we had gone out to the living room where we had a couple more beers. I showed him the sofa and said, "I guess we aren't going to get as far as the sofa and I'd like to see where that goes."</p> <p>"That'd be great. I just love it in the arms of youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
