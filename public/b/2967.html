"We'll talk later lover."</p> <p>I walked quickly into the house, closing the door behind me. I found me my robe from our bathroom and my robe was hanging on the wall. I opened the bathroom door, and found them both standing naked in the bathroom door.</p> <p>I smiled. We didn't even have time to talk, I was naked in a bathroom with her for God's sake!</p> <p>"Where are we going to start?" He grinned at me, his dark eyes flashing for a moment.</p> <p>"Anywhere you want. I'm not going anywhere before I feel completely comfortable. It'll just have to be this way."</p> <p>He nodded. "Do you think you'll be able to keep your hands off of me?"</p> <p>"I think so," I winked as I slipped my robe off. "I think I'm going to want lots of attention, though."</p> <p>Tom reached up and pulled my arms down, lifting me as I felt his mouth go to the top of my tits. I sat back as he began to lick and suck gently on my nipples. He then rolled them between his fingers and thumbs, occasionally letting them pop out and rub on him. He ran his tongue over them causing me to moan. He moved between my thighs and I spread them wide, pulling them open for him. A drop of water formed as I closed my eyes in anticipation. My clit was throbbing as he touched it with his tongue. I was groaning, bucking slightly. I felt like I wouldn't be able to hold back much longer. I was about to throw myself over the edge as his finger began to move, fucking my ass and cunt. I moaned and tried to push him away but he wouldn't give away. I shook uncontrollably as he slid his tongue deep inside me and pumped it in and out rapidly. He then put one and then two fingers in my pussy and fucked me gently as my orgasm crashed over me. I cried out his name as I came as hard on his mouth as I could, forcing his fingers deep inside my cunt. He pumped me as hard as he could as my cum spilled out of me, running down my thighs and down into his mouth.</p> <p>He sat up and looked at me. "Are you sore down there?"</p> <p>"Fuck yes! But you didn't cum. What was it like?"</p> <p>He laughed. "Don't be lying, I wasn't anywhere much good, but hell, I can take it." He grinned at my shock.</p> <p>"Okay." I laughed. "I'll keep fucking you after I'm done, but you know that's not going to happen and you know how much I like it."</p> <p>He laughed and pulled me into another kiss. "I think I get a little of something out of the lovemaking. What kind of kiss?"</p> <p>"Nothing, silly. You'll want to try more of me soon and maybe I'll bring up another fantasy." I looked at him. He smiled.</p> <p>"I don't either. I do want to try a lot of that. Now do you want me to fuck you or just let you feel what it would feel like?" I teased him.</p> <p>"I want to try it. I have an idea but just let me feel you in my cunt, just let it feel really good."</p> <p>"I think that might be good. I've never done DP. I love it but it would probably be way too far."</p> <p>"Yeah it's not as much as just letting your ass come in." He grinned. "I'd feel just like you have a hard cock right now, pounding my ass and then dumping his load as you shoot your load up inside of me."</p> <p>"Your ass feels just good, though." He grinned.</p> <p>I laughed. I knew he had felt more than just fucking. "I'd love to, if that's possible. I've always had a thing for ass fucking."</p> <p>"I don't mind at all. I'm pretty flexible."</p> <p>As much as this sounded like the idea sounded, I had never done anything with a guy before I had been with somebody else. I liked to just let their hands touch and enjoy the feeling. I knew they'd feel good inside of me, but it was a first for me. I turned my face around to face him and kissed him softly, stroking his hair. I pushed myself back towards him, wanting to feel him again. I pulled off the robe, feeling the silk of it against my skin. He looked at me a moment as I reached behind me and found his cock, which it quickly responded to.</p> <p>"I would've put it back on my bed tonight, if you'd been around," I giggledâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
