"Did you notice something in those papers I asked you to take?"</p> <p>"Um," I said, still on weak knees. "Yeah, I didn't know that. But I can't tell you what that was."</p> <p>"'Mekka'?"</p> <p>"Mekka," I nodded numbly. "Can you tell me what it is?"</p> <p>"Yes," he said. "I can tell you. It's the way we should have made all this."</p> <p>"Is it any more out of the way? Can we take this into the open?"</p> <p>"Yes," he said. "This is all very out of the way. You need to trust me to keep this from other people, like you and I, and keep this from going against your marriage."</p> <p>After another few seconds, I realized that this was what I wanted. "Then let's make it as public as I can," I thought. "And I want you to let me keep this from going against my marriage."</p> <p>"If that means staying married to that bastard, that's just what I'll do," he added, grinning.</p> <p>"I think we should go on vacation," I told him, "so we can spend the whole day together in our tropical paradise if this goes against our marriage."</p> <p>"You'll have to do something to keep us safe," he agreed, getting out of the cab. "But I guess that we better take this inside, to make sure I don't get anything out of there. Let's go."</p> <p>He unlocked the door and we walked inside, down the hallway, and went straight to my room and closed and locked the door. It was all I could do to remain focused on my task. I'd never thought of this situation as sexual or romantic or erotic. Yet I wasn't exactly prepared to lose my job.</p> <p>I walked into my bedroom and found him kneeling on the bed waiting patiently for me. I was pretty sure there wasn't anything to worry about. If I didn't like it, I could always tell him. Besides, this was the best part of our deal. I'd had so much to think about that day. I had a very healthy sex drive and I'd felt completely fulfilled a few minutes before, and yet it still seemed like it was far away at best. It seemed to have something to do with things he needed to make it work.</p> <p>"Hi, honey," he said. "Did you want to come stay all day?"</p> <p>I'd always enjoyed his ability to communicate with me, and now that I knew for sure that there was nothing that was wrong, I was looking forward to having some time with him. I smiled and nodded my approval at his answer.</p> <p>"And what would you like to do, honey?" he queried. "Do you have any idea what you're going to be wearing?"</p> <p>"Yes, I'm wearing this," I smiled. "Just because you're going to keep me all day."</p> <p>"It's about time you got home, honey," he smiled. "And you're very, very welcome."</p> <p>"And I didn't have my purse with me," I told him. "But I can grab something for you."</p> <p>"And I'll keep you warm," he said, kissing my cheek. "And warm with me."</p> <p>"Yes, love," I agreed with him. I could feel the muscles in my legs grow taut as the words passed my lips in a seductive tone.</p> <p>"Do you have everything you asked?" he said, a note of sarcasm in his voice. I could feel that his confidence and knowledge was coming back. He was really giving that impression.</p> <p>"Yes," I replied. "Very much. I'll keep everything you asked. It would be nice to keep something special for you."</p> <p>"Do you want me to wait for you while you're at the office," he teased.</p> <p>"No, wait for me," I replied. I'd been waiting for this all day, and now I was ready to play. "Do you want me to finish undressing for you?"</p> <p>"Yes," he replied. His voice lowered and he looked seriously serious. This was really getting to me. It was one of those moments where you always see a different person but at the same time you can't quite tell that person apart. His tone had been seductive yet commanding, and there was something to it. It wasn't a challenge, was actually kind of a sexy, dangerous edge to his voice.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want me to," I questioned. I didn't want him to think that would be the way I'd respond if he asked me to undâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
