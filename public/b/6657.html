Kate's eyes fluttered shut, and she turned to watch for a moment and found herself suddenly looking into the other woman's eyes. Her lips quirked in a smile, and the pair leaned over again to be hugged briefly before retreating again into the shade.</p> <p>"I see you had your last few beers already?"</p> <p>"Yep," Kate nodded, looking at the two women, "not too much, is it?"</p> <p>"Nope, nothing in the way of liquor," Kate shrugged, "though a bottle of wine tonight is definitely something to come," she smiled as she looked around. "A man has to have one bottle a night to be good enough to drink," she mumbled out. "I'll just turn back," Kate said, not bothering to turn back. "I'm gonna be fine," she promised her ex's best friend in a voice that didn't quite carry.</p> <p>The brunette pulled the bottle from the side of the pool, and took long deep draws on the red coloured liquid before throwing it into the ocean. The sound of the ocean filled her ears, and she smiled around in her head. She'd known that in high school, she might be a little wilder, but even so, she was still a little reserved... and a bit of a tomboy. And a lot of fun.</p> <p>"It is a nice summer," she mumbled quietly, and Kate smiled and waved her off, "I've missed it," Kate laughed.</p> <p>Her hand fell away to the sand, and Kate dipped her arms onto the pool with a splash. She looked up as the waves crashed against the water, and saw Kate standing in the pool. Her hand still held out for a moment, before Kate stood, the bottle in one hand, and turned to face her.</p> <p>"You really did something for me yesterday," she smiled warmly as it hit her as their lips met.</p> <p>"You do?"</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"I really did something for you today. I really do," Kate said, before leaning in again. "I really did," Kate kissed her again, more passionately than before, her hands coming up to gently brush her fingers through Kate's dark tresses. She felt a jolt of excitement shoot through her, and Kate's hand slid down over her chest to the small of her back to steady herself. "Come on," she said, once she broke the kiss, "this way."</p> <p>Kate followed Kate, and as they broke away, they stepped out of the pool - her arms held behind her and wrists together - until it was her turn to reach into it. Kate pulled out a blindfold and wrapped it around Kate's eyes. She sat down in the cool sand of the edge of the pool, the water tickling her bare chest as Kate slipped the strap over her eyes. The water cascaded down over her face, her arms askew, and her head bent back as Kate tied her blonde hair into a ponytail.</p> <p>"This will keep you warm," her friend said, as she stepped closer, "and I'll keep you busy."</p> <p>Kate gave another shy smile as the two women stepped to the fence and began working. With the blindfold on, Kate sat down on a rock near the edge of the pool. Kate got a bucket of cool, warm water and placed it beside her, pouring some into her hand before sitting down next to her friend. Their lips pressed to each other, tongues dancing as the sounds of the water playing over their ears filled the air.</p> <p>"That water feels good, doesn't it?" Kate whispered, as they made out, and Kate felt the tension in her body begin to build. Kate could feel her body warming and relaxing, and her mind started fighting through the fear of being caught by her own brother. It hadn't been worth it - the sight of her best friend getting pleasured - to make her mind think about that.</p> <p>"I'm glad we stopped last night, and now that we're making the connection, I wish I had," Kate sighed.</p> <p>"Me too," Kate said, and Kate kissed her again as they moved to the ground. As they kissed, their hands found each other, their legs intertwining in the moist grass beneath them. "You know," Kate started to say, "we need to talk about sex."</p> <p>"I know," Kate nodded, as her hands drifted down her body once more. She could feel her breasts rising and falling as she held Kate, and her hands dipped down into her own panties, pressing their moist skin together softly. "I guess we need to," Kate trailed off, blushing at her lack of inhibition.</p> <p>"It's alright, I'm not going to do it," Kate kissed her cheek, and they fell on the grass together, the cool grassâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
