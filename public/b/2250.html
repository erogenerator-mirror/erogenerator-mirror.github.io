"Do you have a boyfriend?"</p> <p>"No," she replied honestly.</p> <p>"But your husband? We might be the biggest couple on the planet," I said.</p> <p>"He's only a student. I don't want to take on any responsibilities. It's about as close as you can come getting," she replied.</p> <p>I nodded my head and got out of the car.</p> <p>"You can leave at the end of the block, take your shoes off, and put them on the other side if you feel like it," she said. "It'll be fun. I know what I must look like down there, and I plan on showing it off a lot," she said as I opened the door.</p> <p>As soon as I closed the door a guy opened the door for me and pulled me into his arms.</p> <p>"Hey you!" he said to me, before he stepped back and dropped to his knees.</p> <p>The moment that he got his shorts down, and exposed himself to me, his mouth was busy, and a big mouthful filled. The guy was at least 8 inches. Maybe 9, maybe 10, but that's nothing compared to a cock. It was rock hard, the head was swollen, and the shaft was shiny with precum. As I stared at his cock, I had no idea just how big it really is, and the taste of his juice made me want to get my hands and mouth on that.</p> <p>I wanted to lick every inch of it, to drink it all in. But I knew I wouldn't be able to.</p> <p>"You have no choice," I said as he pulled me to him.</p> <p>When we were kissing and being touched, his cock was almost completely hard. I felt a pang of jealousy, but that was quickly overshadowed by a feeling of excitement. It was as if I could feel the very core of a man from inside out.</p> <p>"There are other ways to get to know," I said as we broke our first embrace. "I bet you would like that, wouldn't you?"</p> <p>"I'd die to do it."</p> <p>"Good!" I said. "And for a change, you can call me Sandy," I suggested.</p> <p>A few seconds later, both of us were kissing again, and I was running my hands all over his ass and thighs. He pulled his shorts off and began to work his way up to his cock. There was a small drop of precum on the end, but it didn't appear large. I watched it as it formed before my eyes. The whole scene excited me.</p> <p>"I've always had a thing for shaved heads," I said to him. "I'd love to eat your cock and balls while you blow me," I added.</p> <p>My own cock felt hard, and I could easily tell that I was going to lose it anyway. I was getting turned on. It wasn't even close to the point of being uncomfortable. I could feel his tongue licking the head of my cock, and at the same time I could feel a sense of eroticism. My hands were running all over his ass and thighs, as he got me to the point where my cock was begging for the attention. It was just so incredible. I was going to blow him without anyone.</p> <p>Sandy took me deeper into his mouth as I pressed forward. His head bobbed rapidly as I fucked his tonsils. Within a few minutes, I felt the pressure start to building in my balls. He pulled his mouth off my cock, then held it there for just a second. His eyes widened at that, and then he smiled, and then he moved his hands slowly, back a bit, and held the base of my shaft.</p> <p>He took his sweet time making a long lick and swallowing of the head of my cock, and I thought I was going to die of joy and ecstasy at the same moment. I had no control, of what was happening.</p> <p>I started to cum. A torrent of sperm shot out my prick, right into Sandy's waiting mouth. He kept my cock in his mouth until the feeling subsided, and then pulled off as if I had done it before.</p> <p>Sandy wiped my cock, and then cleaned me. He leaned over to kiss me on the lips. His hand caressed the front of my pants and ran down into the crack of my ass. His hand rested on my right pant leg as I pulled away from him.</p> <p>"Come on," he said as we walked to his car. "I can't believe how much you turn me on."</p> <p>"I could tell that you liked it," I said. "I think it's only fair thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
