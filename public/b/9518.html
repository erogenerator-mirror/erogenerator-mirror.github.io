"I want a good look at you and I'm not going to take chances."</p> <p>"I'm glad you enjoyed the night," he said then paused as his hand dropped. "My arm is starting to hurt from holding you steady... you're doing okay."</p> <p>"Thanks," I said, and then reached over and kissed his cheek. "I think you're right, I did enjoy being held close."</p> <p>"I'm sorry about the hand hanger... it's not going back to normal. It will happen again and again. Just don't ask, just trust me."</p> <p>We talked for a while longer and before I knew it the party was winding back. I had spent the last few years waiting for the perfect one, and that one day was it. It's a beautiful day like every other day of our lives. For the first time in the last year the time had gone by fast enough for us.</p> <p>Our party was a great affair. We played guitar, drum and pop as a group, danced with old friends at many of the clubs and generally took what we could get. We got a lot of questions about the club we went to and where it was headed but that's the first story of tonight's story!</p> <p>I was sitting on one of the leather seats with Matt, his body on my lap and his arms around my neck. We had started out talking about our careers and careers and things in general and I told Matt the whole story. We talked like long lost friends, and at one point I got so excited I nearly fell over. At that point I was in heaven! We had a good laugh and it seemed like a good idea at first. Then just as we were getting too close I blurted out what we had done over the years and what we had tried. Before I knew it he had moved my face in close and I could see the excitement building in him as well.</p> <p>"My God," I finally said. "I don't know... what the hell did you think I was doing over there?"</p> <p>I knew he needed to calm down and he needed me to calm him down. He must have felt that I was having second thoughts because he pulled me to him and hugged me. Before I knew it we were hugging each other and he was crying. I reached over and put my arm around his head when he suddenly pulled away.</p> <p>"What's wrong, Matt" I said. "How could you ever possibly be interested in me like that?"</p> <p>"Don't worry, I don't even know what I was thinking. I love you," he told me, the tears in his eyes falling down to my cheek.</p> <p>"I know you don't... but I just didn't know..." I told him.</p> <p>"I don't care you don't... I love you too," he told me.</p> <p>I think I was in tears myself because they stopped. It felt so good to be held by my lover again. I had a man, a man I loved so deeply and I felt like I was falling in love with my body and him. I was so relieved when Matt finally stopped sobbing and looked into my eyes.</p> <p>"That was so incredible, baby," he told me. "I never expected it for me to enjoy it so much. Don't get me wrong... it was awesome. I loved dancing with you and I hope you did too."</p> <p>"Mmm, thanks... I think I do... I don't want to be too much of a lezzer," I told him. "I didn't realize I missed it that much either."</p> <p>I know Matt had to think I was joking as well as me, but I said a few more things that only I could tell him about my dreams, my fantasies and about my love life. He did listen to each of my rants and seemed genuinely grateful after they were said and they meant something and I truly felt as though I had found a way to give myself a second chance. We stayed in bed that night and slept well. The next day I spent with my boy and we had a good discussion.</p> <p>Before he left I told him I loved him with all my heart. This evening was just the beginning of the night I planned for it! It turned out to be so wonderful that the next day I told him about what happened and that I felt as I would ever feel. I told Matt everything... all of it, even the sex. His reaction the first time we had a threesome was so wonderful... he loved it and I love it!</p> <p>We began getting together three or four more times a month to see if we would ever repeat the event. Matt would come over to my apartmentâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
