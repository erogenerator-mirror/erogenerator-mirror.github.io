I could hear the water running in an enclosed room of the house and I imagined it was the shower I had used a couple of days ago to wash off the smell of the soap. But I really could not hear the music that was playing and I did not hear anything else. I felt very tired and so very alone. In the bathroom I decided to take a shower and as the hot water ran down my legs I suddenly heard a light humming sound and for just a moment I thought it was one of the other machines that had built the shower room out of its own accord. I could not see what it was about but I decided to be quiet for a bit and let the water run out. I was very aware of feeling the tingle between my thighs and I could not resist the feelings of anticipation and arousal as my fingers moved and my heart continued to beat quickly.</p> <p>Then the water stopped. I felt very alone and the smell of sandal scent in a dark hall that was full of steam. I wanted to be as quiet as possible and I was feeling very sexy and very desirable, but I couldn't. I turned to face the doorway and as I did I caught sight of the door to the bathroom through the crack in the door. It was just above my right shoulder and the steam rising from it made me shiver just a bit in my anticipation, but also for one of two reasons, the other was because there was no one there and the anticipation was exciting in its own way. I wanted to open the door and see what that "door" looked like and just as I opened it I saw a shadow in the corner of the door.</p> <p>I heard a voice just barely above the steam, "Hello" I said.</p> <p>There was the sound of a laugh in my ear and then I heard, "Wow" I thought to myself, "That is nice". I turned to go back out of the room but as I turned back towards the doorway it was just to my left. With both of us in the light I turned to look behind and saw that the light switch in the bathroom turned on in the corner of the room and for the first time I could see how dark it was. Then I saw something that made my mouth drop.</p> <p>There, on the wall, behind the door to the bathroom, stood the most beautiful nude girl I had ever seen. Her skin was very pale and her breasts were perfect in their high peaks and her nipples were full and stiff from the air. Her long blonde hair hung around her shoulders and her legs were spread wide giving me a chance to admire her beautifully shaped female form. As I did she bent at the waist, leaned her head back, smiled and raised her right leg straight up, giving me a perfect shot of her naked ass and pussy. Now she was leaning over and her hands went directly to her pussy, pulling her lips open so that there was a clear view of her engorged pussy lips and her pinkish pink flesh. I tried not to look, but I could see that her pussy was beautiful and she was wetter than I had seen her in the shower.</p> <p>With that I became more excited and moved back into the door. Now I was standing on two feet from the doorway looking down at a beautiful naked, beautiful woman with her pussy and breasts right in my face. She looked so sexy standing there bent over the bathroom wall with her legs wide apart. Her pussy lips were pulled open and it seemed every breath from her she was causing her pussy to show even more swollen and pink flesh. The dark pink flesh seemed to beckon me and as I stepped into the room I could feel a wetness in my shorts growing.</p> <p>I saw the sight of those gorgeous breasts dangling down in front of my face, almost brushing against my chest. Her eyes closed and her mouth parted almost in a gasp. "Oh, that looks terrific" I thought, "It looks like she has an invitation from heaven." Slowly I walked towards her and looked at her very inviting, very lovely body for the first time. The light in the bathroom was dark and the light of the lightbulb made it appear almost dark when I got just a bit closer. The shape of her eyes told me that this was no one she had ever seen before, only beautiful and beautiful woman and I was now looking at the most magnificent naked woman.</p> <p>As I got closer the look of beauty was that of a beautiful woman. The light in the bathroom was still very dim and her breasts were very pale as if they were being poured over their solid ivory curves and they moved with her breath while her entire body was moving toward me, pushing her breasts closer to her body in anticipation of her mouth. Finally I reached out and grasped her hands as she drew her knees up even higher on each of her muscular thighs. I wanted to hold her hands but then she grabbed my hands almost holding them at my side.</p> <p>Sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
