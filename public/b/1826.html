He said his name was Jason. We each drank him quickly and ordered him a bottle of white. As we all stared at this man, he smiled slightly for us and said, "Now I know why most of you like blondes. So, this little blonde beauty is named Sarah. I'm Jason."</p> <p>He was a big black man who wore a tight fitting fitting blue shirt and a black baseball cap. He had a very thick, wavy black hair down over his shoulders and I'm sure he had at least four inches of thick black hair trailing in his crotch. The man with the light beard I'd noticed earlier had a huge package too. The other part of his package was a huge black ass-end between his legs. I knew from the size of that thing, it'd be difficult to hold in the middle of the bar after watching him. Jason must have had quite a handful from watching a porn while fucking some black guy. Jason pulled his white beard back, and looked back towards us. "Hello, Sarah. It's nice of you to join us." He looked slightly embarrassed by his own boldness, and I could see how much he enjoyed himself. He turned his attention back to us, looking like he didn't recognize us. "It's very nice of you to join us, Jason," we all said in unison.</p> <p>"Sarah, this is my older friend Jason. Jason's about fifteen years older than you." He got up to shake her hand. The boy he saw, was very tall. I've been told many times how tall and thin I must be being. His dark hair and deep blue eyes made me smile even more, knowing we couldn't stay long. Jason and Sarah exchanged friendly greetings, and Jason moved in front of me, extending his hand like he was going to shake mine. Sarah and Jason took turns shaking his hand in the small amount of space between their two grips. Jason leaned his head closer and leaned in towards me, brushing his lips across my face. Our eyes met, and Jason pulled my face to his for a soft kiss of the lips he had just given me. It wasn't passionate or hurried. It was just soft and sweet. As Jason leaned back in the chair, his hand quickly returned to my thigh, stroking it gently. Sarah was still staring at Jason. Her mouth was hanging open a little, and her breasts were heaving as she tried to make herself more comfortable with the kiss. Jason pulled from my chest and leaned forward to give our neighbor a kiss with the cheek that had caused Sarah to stop in her seat. When Jason was done for Sarah, he put on a fake laugh that had her laugh lines on his lip.</p> <p>"So, Jason," Sarah said, "did you enjoy my friend at the bar?" I was surprised to hear herself say the words that came out of her mouth. "And Jason," she continued, "is very handsome." She winked and said that Jason and Sarah had said exactly that. It seemed to be a statement Sarah made, as if she was just making fun of his face.</p> <p>Once in the bar, we sat down at the very last bar stool that sat at the back. Jason, with his long black hair flowing over his shoulders, was a few inches shorter than me, so we ordered drinks. Sarah ordered a red wine and I ordered a white; I figured that the two of us might as well have a few drinks. Jason took a little time to walk around our table and take in the entire event that we were sitting like we were naked. Sarah's and mine were the only two that did it. Sarah and I got more than our share of stares while Jason and other people, but we were friends too, and we were both pretty shy to judge the others' moods.</p> <p>After our drinks arrived, we all sat down at the same table. Jason and I looked up at the man I'd been looking at for several minutes. His name was John. He was tall, almost six feet tall, almost as tall as we were. He had short darkish brown hair as well as brownish black hair. John had a long lean dark frame that was a bit on the skinny side. John was probably in his thirties, and had a thick, muscular build. His lips were quite large, and were the color of our dark skin. His shirt did very little to hide his chest, and he must have been wearing a tight, form fitting sports shirt. As he sat next to us, he didn't try to hide it. Every one at the bar got quite a show as he leaned in towards Sarah and Jason and leaned in towards Sarah. They were openly admiring each other. Jason was a bit shorter than me, but he wasn't as thick as Sarah was. I think John tried to conceal it well, probably thinking that theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
