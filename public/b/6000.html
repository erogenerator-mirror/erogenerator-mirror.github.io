Yes, the best lay, my best friend with a killer body, wasn't lying. I turned on the light and gazed at my sexy blonde goddess of all women. At 39 she looked younger than her 31 years but she had kept her curves in pretty good shape. A tiny 5-4.</p> <p>I stripped off my clothes and sat on the bed. I pulled the comforter from the bed and wrapped it around me. I closed my eyes and smiled. Slowly my right leg began to crawl towards the edge of the bed and onto the floor. I slowly turned my legs and let them fall onto the bed. As soon as I was in position I took my legs in my hands and spread them wide. I placed my feet firmly on the foot board so that they were touching the floor.</p> <p>"You're absolutely stunning. Your body is so sexy."</p> <p>"Thanks!" I replied. It had been several months since I had been with a good woman and I wanted to make a statement. I hadn't seen her naked yet, my last visit to her house had been to her mother's house. The whole scene had been a turn-on and with one more move of my foot on the floor I knew that I could go from a nice flat stomach to a nicely proportioned woman.</p> <p>"I'm going to enjoy this. You're beautiful."</p> <p>"Then get undressed. Come and lie down and I'll fix you up."</p> <p>As she stood up from the bathroom, I noticed that her large breasts stood out proudly and her nipples were dark brown, not the pinkish brown of the rest of her body but her nipple had a large areola on one side. On the opposite side appeared to be pronounced areolas.</p> <p>She walked towards me and began pulling off her shirt. "David, please undress," she said.</p> <p>I stood up and slid off my t-shirt and threw it to the side. As I lowered her pants, I ran my hand along her left thigh and up to her pussy. I took two fingers from my right hand and slid them inside of her. She squealed at the contact.</p> <p>"I missed this," I said.</p> <p>"Oh fuck me, David. Please fuck me."</p> <p>As I continued to fondle her with one hand and fingered her pussy with the other I began to kiss and lick her nipples. I slowly worked down her chest and ran my tongue down her flat stomach and to her belly button. I began to kiss her lower tummy as I slid my fingers back through my slippery sex. She squealed once again when I reached the end of her belly button. I began to lick her belly button as she reached down with her right hand and placed my head between her legs where it immediately became erect.</p> <p>With her panties now off she was completely naked. I lowered myself between her legs taking her by the hips as I moved myself between her thighs. As I slid into her wetness I kissed her stomach and slowly worked my way down to her sweet spot. I was just out of her reach when she grabbed my face in her hands and pulled me up towards her. As I slid my lips over hers she sucked her vaginal lubricant into her hot mouth. As she continued to move her mouth over mine and held my face in her hands she pushed her tongue inside of my mouth.</p> <p>I didn't know if she was ready for me to stay with her or if she was going to take the risk.</p> <p>"Honey, can I ask you something?" she asked.</p> <p>"Of course you can," I responded with a smile.</p> <p>She giggled.</p> <p>"Just because you brought me like a baby doesn't mean anything about how amazing you are. What's it about you that I find hard?"</p> <p>"I guess there's no such thing as hard."</p> <p>To my surprise, she continued to run her fingers through my hair.</p> <p>"Do you think I am as good looking as you?"</p> <p>"I think you are beautiful."</p> <p>"Thanks but no, I didn't know. I never asked and you know it."</p> <p>She laughed.</p> <p>"Would you like to know for me?" she asked with a sexy smile.</p> <p>"If I did it would you do the same for me?"</p> <p>"Of course I would. It's the best thing I've done and the best woman on earth."</p> <p>I leaned in and kissed her in response.</p> <p>"You're beautiful." I replied.</p> <p>She smiled again.</p> <p>"Thank you, David," she replied with a warm smile.</p> <p>I began to move in and out of her as she kept herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
