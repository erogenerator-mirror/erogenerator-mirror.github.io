"Just think what would happen after you were gone. What would you then do?"</p> <p>"I... think...that I could get into the habit of taking care of our kids so they could be better cared for," I replied. "I'd probably be able to keep my head down like that without causing any problems. Wouldn't that be so bad?"</p> <p>"It is," she agreed. "It would make the kids so happy to have you around."</p> <p>"I can do that."</p> <p>She thought about it a bit then smiled and walked me to the door. "See you around," she said. "Bye!"</p> <p>I thanked her, told her goodbye and left her.</p> <p>That Friday morning I got out of bed at 5:00 to give the kids time to go to school, then walked to the door and stood at the edge for about 15 seconds. A light came on and I smiled then waved and headed down the hallway. I opened the door in a flash to head to the office. A bit later and I found Karen, Karen's best friend, sitting at the photocopier with the others who had already gone to the store. I smiled then told her that things weren't good and said to let 'em go. She nodded and I walked off. "It is a nice office," she said. "Good weather there," she added.</p> <p>I spent the rest of the day doing the same as Karen. It was a nice change from the normal routine and I was relieved when Karen told me that the office door would only be open once it got dark. We had the time in the afternoon until 7:00.</p> <p>I got ready and had already gotten ready for school just before 7:00. At lunch, I went home with a little bit of excitement. At 6:00 I came out, closed the office door, took the kids out for their lunch, and went to lock myself in the bedroom. "I'm going to go get supper ready so I can do that," I said as I pulled on my robe around my waist. I walked down to the livingroom that I knew would be the most comfortable to face up to the children after their school day and got a glass of water as I got the children ready.</p> <p>"Boys and girls? Yes please."</p> <p>I set the trays of food down on the coffee table in the livingroom and looked at them as they sat. Karen had her back to me and the kids stared, even though they were in the middle of lunch. "I was going to have something for them," she said as she looked at the kids. "I figured we could have something on that day."</p> <p>Boys.</p> <p>Now I've got to say that for many years I've had Karen; we've dated, and I've dated a couple of times, but we never got that far. She's a good mother; she's a great wife, if you get my drift. I'm just not as happy in bed with her either as I am with you. She's the life of the family; she's the good life, and you can be happy with her. She's the perfect wife and mother, with the best part of her personality. I'm not exactly a cuckold so it's a big ego boost for me that she likes it when she knows that what she's doing is pleasing you. I really have feelings of that nature that she doesn't. I was not about to cheat on her by letting the kids see just how I felt.</p> <p>I got them a couple of drinks and then walked back out to the kitchen. Karen was looking at the kids with a concerned look on her face. "Have you done anything today?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes I did, actually."</p> <p>"Good," I said, "because I would like you to help us. Come to my room right away if you want to." She took a half and followed me across the hall.</p> <p>Karen was already standing on the stairs taking another drink of water when I got to the bedroom. "Where should I get this?" I asked pulling down the bed covers on the bed.</p> <p>"Put it over your head," she said walking to the closet.</p> <p>"I don't know."</p> <p>"Come over here and just lay on the bed."</p> <p>I followed her over and lay on my side on the bed. We were right by the bed, but at the foot was a long, narrow mirror. I looked closely at the mirror. My cock had completely deflated because I didn't know how long this had been going on. I took a sip of water, then looked at the mirror, then back at Karen. She came straight into the bathroom with the mirror on the back of the door. "Turn around and lean against the wall over here for a minute," she told meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
