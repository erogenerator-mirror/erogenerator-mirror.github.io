It was then, as she climbed up onto the bed on all fours, his eyes widened in surprise, as she held the hem of her thong away from her sex. He was stunned until she slowly pulled it down over her hips, and dropped it to the floor, followed by her blouse. She lay back, and he stood up next to her, kissing her again. Taking his cock in her hand, she guided it to her moist sex, and with one slow thrust was in, then out, then in again, over and over again. His hands were on her breasts, stroking her nipples while she took his cock inside her.</p> <p>After a half hour of this erotic torture, they both got very excited. He couldn't hold back much less ejaculate if he was any more concerned with having her on their third or fourth session alone in the evening. As she lay on the mattress beside him, stroking him under the pillow, he saw his wife lay on her back under the afghan. Her head rested on a pillow, and her legs were slightly parted showing him her sex. He smiled at his wife.</p> <p>"What did you think about," he asked, "that I could bring you two over now?" As they both looked at the closed bedroom door, he wondered about the possibility that they would see him. He thought about it, and was surprised to realize he really wanted to have sex with them, and that he wanted to have her naked.</p> <p>"God, yes," he replied.</p> <p>"Well, at least we know how you came about doing it, don't we?" he asked.</p> <p>"You, too," she replied, "and we can talk about it when we're alone."</p> <p>"As much as I'd love to do this, I can't," he began to say.</p> <p>She moved over him. "There's more," she said, "and you'll have to decide if it's for you." As he kissed her, she lowered herself on him. "That's why I'm here," she said softly.</p> <p>As his swollen cock penetrated her, she murmured, "Are you ready," she said. "I'm so ready, and you're going so far that my pussy is going to suck your cock dry," she told him, holding her body on hers with both hands.</p> <p>"Yes," he said, "I'm ready."</p> <p>"Then," her voice was deep and husky, "and we'll talk later."</p> <p>She smiled. "Now," she said.</p> <p>In all of their years together, she had never mentioned her sexuality to him. He had considered a few times before, but always stopped himself. He really did not know this was his wife. She was his wife, his mother of the bride, his wife to be, and his mother to keep, and they would make everything that went on between them that way. They had a sexual relationship that neither would define, but that was what they had chosen for themselves, and no one would ever feel comfortable leaving such a relationship.</p> <p>Their sex life has been great. But their lovemaking was special, and they realized that there was nothing they could possibly do about it. After his ex-wife went on a cruise and was gone a month, he had to go to his buddies in Denver, so he did not get to see his mother. They had gotten so excited at the thought that they both came to him at the same time. As his orgasm started in his balls, and he fired his load, they both climaxed simultaneously, then fell asleep, each with an arm around the other until he realized that he could not tell whether it was a long and good night, or if it was a short and pleasant oneâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
