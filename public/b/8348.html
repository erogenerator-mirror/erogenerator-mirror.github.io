She took a deep intake of air. "I'm...I'm not sure I'm ready..."</p> <p>"Why not? Why should it be easy?" I asked her.</p> <p>"It's just...it's not..." She stammered.</p> <p>"What? You want me to stop?" I asked her.</p> <p>"No, it's just...it's just..."</p> <p>"Not sure?" I asked her.</p> <p>She looked at me. I shrugged my shoulders, and she turned around, facing the door. "No? Sure."</p> <p>"It's just..." I said. She gave a bit of fear, something that I didn't expect. It wasn't fear that made us feel this way...that we would go too far. It was the fear that we didn't want to go too far.</p> <p>"Alright, I'll just leave."</p> <p>"I know." She said. I went back to the front door. I turned towards her, and as I did, I closed the door.</p> <p>"You need to go get a change of clothes." I said to her.</p> <p>She nodded in response. She was still in shock.</p> <p>"Just go." I said.</p> <p>She walked out of the back exit, and ran up the stairs to her room.</p> <p>The day seemed to pass by in slow motion. I just kept thinking over and over...why she hadn't gone out that night. Every time I looked at her she looked amazing, she looked amazing. I would stare at her, thinking how I would love to bend her over my knees and pound her. She wouldn't ever say yes...maybe she'd go fuck me right? I would have to ask for the fuck. I guess I'm glad that she had gone to visit her mother. I can't blame her either.</p> <p>I had taken it upon myself to have a very difficult day. After my classes, I went home to get some homework done and a little rest from the stress I had been put through for the past five hours. After going to bed I thought about leaving, but before I could even start to get to sleep I fell asleep.</p> <p>**********â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
