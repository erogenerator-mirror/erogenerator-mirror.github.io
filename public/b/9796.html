The walls looked like they could be cobwebs, with a series of iron gates at the corners.</p> <p>"You do?"</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>She led me to a large couch, which had a long sofa style back and chair, also an antique coffee table. A single chair rested on the floor and a large, circular sofa covered the end. The sofa's long legs were slung over the back and back in the chair, along with the armrest, where her right leg was propped up on the seat.</p> <p>I felt that I couldn't see her anywhere. As I walked to the left, she opened her arms again.</p> <p>"Come on."</p> <p>I held out a hand and she took it, guiding me between her knees again until my cock brushed against her pussy as I stood.</p> <p>I felt like a man. A woman. The woman I had kissed and felt, I didn't want to feel like, but had wanted to for the past week, that we had not been friends. But I hadn't thought about it.</p> <p>"How's this?" she asked me as I approached her, her eyes flicking downward as my cock brushed against her belly. "Do you like?" she asked, her voice husky, seductive.</p> <p>"God, yes," I murmured, as I stood between her legs, feeling her hands on my knees.</p> <p>She was very excited. So much wet juice. I was already moving again towards getting there, slowly, feeling the movement as it made my skin rub all over hers, as she raised her knee a little and opened her legs slightly before she pushed my hands away. I backed myself up until my cock head nudged her pussy again and we were in front of her mouth.</p> <p>She looked up and smiled. "How do I do that, lover?" she teased, lowering herself on her knees and opening her mouth in a small, wide oval. Without saying anything, I slowly lowered my head, licking slowly along it. My mouth never left her pussy, no way I could move my tongue much as I would have on a real cock, but, oh God, I needed to taste her again. I raised my mouth up and slowly pulled her knees apart with my hands while I kissed her left thigh. I slowly started to lick my way upward toward where her knee was.</p> <p>"Hmmmm, that's good," she said as I finally reached her pussy, my tongue pressing against her wet hairless outer lips. "Oh yes! Oh yes! Oh... yes," she said again, moving her hips so my tongue could go deeper inside, pushing in until her thighs rested against my ears, and I could hear her voice again. "Aaaaaahhhh..."</p> <p>She reached down and started squeezing and caressing my balls and pushing towards my asshole, as I licked my way back up to her clit, my tongue going in circles around it. She stopped again and pushed my head against her pussy again.</p> <p>"It tastes good..." she said, again pushing my head down so I had to put my tongue into her again, this time into her slit and her lips sucked on it slightly, her juices running out of her and coating my tongue. She had no choice, as if to say, "Do it." When her clit was in the right spot, I pressed my tongue as deep in and on it as I could.</p> <p>"Oh, oh, OH, oh-ah-ah," she kept saying. "Ah-h-h-h. Now, now, please, now, now," I felt her hands on my head and the force of her hips rubbing as she pushed me off.</p> <p>I didn't say anything, just looked up at her and smiled at her. The intensity inside her made me dizzy.</p> <p>"Come sit down," I said as I sat on the floor. "We can do this right, don't go anywhere, I love it," I smiled.</p> <p>"I'm not that heavy," she giggled. "My feet are getting so sore."</p> <p>"That's normal, I love this, it feels so good, you just have to relax."</p> <p>She began to rub her feet together, her feet and her toes almost touching, as I moved behind and lay my head down on the carpet. I felt her pull her legs further back over mine.</p> <p>I felt her start to kiss my shoulder, my neck, my chest, the side of my right breast. I felt another touch. I thought 'I am wet."</p> <p>She lifted my shirt so I could feel that smooth wet skin with both handsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
