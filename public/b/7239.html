"Sit on my lap," she insisted. "It will be easier for you to lie down."</p> <p>When I complied she put her hand on my arm and we both sat down on the couch. After a few minutes I started to feel a little sleepy, but my eyes kept seeing the sights and sights of her naked body. I had lost track of time as we sat there, me feeling as though I was watching more than the nakedness of her. I was aware of every curve and detail of her body and every movement she made. I could see her naked breasts with their hard nipples; I could feel her bare ass cheek on top my thigh. I found myself staring at her beautiful breasts, and as she leaned forward so her ass cheeks brushed against my skin. I didn't care about looking, I didn't care about anything but how she felt.</p> <p>While her breath brushed my face and she whispered "God," all of her movements became almost trance like.</p> <p>She leaned forward to kiss me.</p> <p>I could have done more but I didn't want to. I didn't want to do anything but kiss her lips and touch her body.</p> <p>Her lips felt so soft and tasted like candy. Her mouth was full and she was moist. After a couple minutes her lips parted and she kissed my mouth softly. I felt my cock throbbing.</p> <p>Her hands were moving up and down my thighs, almost stroking me. Her fingers found the front of my pants and found me throbbing. She pulled my belt button and undid my pants button. They hung loosely in front of my erection. She tugged my pants down to my thighs, leaving me on a chair, legs spread slightly apart.</p> <p>She continued to kiss my mouth with the tip of her tongue exploring every vein and fold as if she had been there before. I reached between her legs and felt the warmth and wetness as she started to open herself up.</p> <p>I continued to feel the warm air through the open window on her naked pussy, the scent of her arousal enveloping me as it filled my nostrils.</p> <p>She brought her mouth to my neck where she took a finger from my pants and brought it to her clitoris, where she used the finger tip to caress her clit. I felt my cock throb again so hard I thought she would break free from my lap. "Oh my," she said to me "You make me lose control like that."</p> <p>My cock was as hard as steel and I didn't know if I was going to come. I felt something else; there it was, in her pussy, it was my cock. "Oh God!" I couldn't believe this was happening; her finger was on her clitoris and I was in her for the second time! She put one hand on the back of the couch to steady herself and put one finger into me for the penetration into her. The finger seemed to go in and out almost like the cock. This time she didn't stop; she kept going. Her body moved against mine as if she wanted to move all of me to her. She was moving in me and I kept moving.</p> <p>"Don't stop!" I cried out so I wouldn't cry from her touch.</p> <p>My cum was about to get out; the pressure building in my balls and in their contents.</p> <p>"I need to cum."</p> <p>"No, not yet." She was on the brink of it.</p> <p>"I need to cum." I pulled her up so she was sitting on me. As I lifted her I felt a hand on the back of one of her feet. In her shoes she was nearly perfect. She let go of the car. I lifted her back up the rest of the way, her legs wrapping around me. The feel of her pussy made my cock throb. I could feel her nipples hard as they rubbed each of my thighs.</p> <p>I lifted myself up so I was on my knees, and then I was between her legs. With one motion I slid my cock right into her cunt. The warm wetness inside of her was like fire on my cock and as I did it, she let go of her hair to push her hair back behind her face.</p> <p>She was ready and there was a cock, I wanted my first real one inside of her.</p> <p>"Don't pull out baby, I'm ready."</p> <p>Without saying a word, I felt her mouth around the head of my cock as she wrapped her legs around me as I drove back into her.</p> <p>It didn't take long for this to happen: her cunt muscles sucking my cock hard as she went upâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
