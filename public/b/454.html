The thought of the possibility of an unplanned pregnancy was too much, too scary, too exciting. He was always so cautious and cautious. I knew how good this feeling was. I knew how very excited the prospect was, just like it was exciting it felt so wonderful. His eyes seemed to be locked into my vision as I stared, mesmerized and excited as I was. The fear of getting caught sent me over the edge. His own body began to react and I felt my body shake with excitement. The fear left me, as did his eyes. He held my gaze, his face was a mask of love, desire, excitement…I could see myself in his eyes…</p> <p>But I didn't want him to know, of course, no, I didn't. He didn't trust me either, so he'd never know. I was scared, but the thought of the possibility of the danger of pregnancy was exciting too. I felt as horny as I had for 20 years. I had the feeling that I could feel myself quivering with excitement, trembling with excitement, feeling the tingle in my belly, and thinking of my father all over again, again again. I wanted all he'd have if he'd known. I wanted his cock, his love, his life…the excitement and the need for him to be good…and so many other things…I just wanted him to know he was the one for me.</p> <p>He let me look for a while, but I didn't want his eyes roaming my body, my chest, my bottom, my lips. I knew he was watching.</p> <p>"I want to make you feel good, baby," he said huskily, "it feels so good, I'm so wet right now. Does that feel good, Baby…do you feel good…?"</p> <p>"Yes," I said quietly "It feels good, that feels good."</p> <p>He kissed my lips, the cheeks, my face, my forehead, my eyelids; he lifted my face. I smiled, then he kissed me deeply and slowly. God, it felt incredible, the feeling of his lips on mine. He tasted like mint as he kissed me and then he ran his tongue across my lips and licked me. I pulled him closer, and we kissed each other so long and hard, our tongues were entwined in the warm water. I felt myself sliding in the water with the warm water. My skin was so soft. His hands roamed over my body, over my breasts, lower, down between my legs and I felt him spread them.</p> <p>"No don't," I teased him. He understood; he wanted to slide down lower, between my legs, but I turned and laid back against the side of the hot tub. He moved between my legs and positioned himself over me. "Are you sure?" I whispered to him. "You don't have to."</p> <p>"I want you," he said, "I want you to feel pleasure as much as you do from having me in the water with you. It's so good, I really want you too."</p> <p>I could see he was going to be more gentle. But I wasn't going to get away with it. He would probably enjoy it too…I wanted him to do whatever he wanted with me. He kissed me deeply, as his fingers spread my legs open. I felt his hot breath, so hot in fact, it made me shiver. He could smell me, feel my musky, spicy perfume and feel the heat of my wet sex. He took his time working with his tongue, moving it up and down my lips, slowly opening them as he searched out the fleshy folds of my labia. I felt him taking a few small flicks as he did, and I began moving my hips to encourage him.</p> <p>He took a breast and sucked it, and then he reached up with fingers and ran them over my nipples. I moved my hips against him and he slid one finger into my sex as he slid the other hand between my legs and began feeling for my entrance. I was so wet and he could tell.</p> <p>He pulled his hand away when he slid both inside me and began searching. He could feel the wetness. He pressed into me, feeling the heat.</p> <p>"I want you, now Baby!" He whispered in my ear. "I want it."</p> <p>"Ok," I whispered back. "Be careful"</p> <p>We got our suits on. I stood with my legs together and his shoulders as we kissed each other. I leaned on the edge of the hot tub, and he moved over me to sit in the opposite end. He reached over and gently ran his hand across my belly, up to my breasts. He pulled me gently to him, and kissed me again.</p> <p>He kissed me everywhere, everywhere and everything he touched. His fingers stroked—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
