I stopped as if I was going to cum, and then my entire body was shaking. I couldn't move. I could barely breathe. Just then, the shower door opened, and then a warm and wet hand grabbed me and pulled me inside.</p> <p>I looked over at her and she was staring in shock and horror at me. I had never seen her like that before, in her horror as well as in her sexiest act; a lust filled stare. Her head was thrashing from side to side. She was panting and she was still coming. I could feel the muscles in her neck flex and she seemed to be trembling. She looked so frightened. Tears were streaming down her cheeks and her voice was barely above a whisper.</p> <p>"Don't leave, you fucking bastard! Please?"</p> <p>She was breathing heavy as she reached out to take my hand. "Don't leave, Jack. Please don't ever leave. You must never know that you made me do this. Please take me into, my house, don't ever leave."</p> <p>I looked at her a little longer before saying, "I want to help you, but I can't."</p> <p>I stood looking at her for several moments. I started to back down the hallway. She let go of my hand and started to move towards the stairs.</p> <p>"Wait," I said looking down at her and she just looked up at me. "I'll call you in, though." I turned to go up the stairs to my room, but again her eyes took me down. She was in my bed in about 30 seconds, but as I hurried towards my room, she was still standing, completely naked, in front of the window. I tried to stop and she pulled me in.</p> <p>"Get on your knees, Jack. I want you to look in the mirrors on the walls, so they can watch us," she was pleading.</p> <p>She pulled me over her and I could feel the warmth and smell of her sex on my face. I moved in between her legs. She took the glass of wine off the bed, poured herself a little on it, and then rubbed it on my face. She looked up at me and said, "That's a lot more than that." She looked down at the glass in my hand before reaching for the lamp beside the bed. I took her hand.</p> <p>"Thank you," she said as I opened the lamp and touched the glass. She pulled her hand away from the glass and let her hand go free with the glass. She took a sip as I did the same.</p> <p>"I just love you so much, Jack. God, you're beautiful. You always look absolutely incredible."</p> <p>"Thanks. I'm just glad you came here without any of your girlfriends around to take your spot."</p> <p>"No, I'm here. And you're beautiful too."</p> <p>"Thank you, I hope you don't mind. I'm just not used to seeing you naked. You look so incredible."</p> <p>I had her turn on the bed so that she was on top of me. She rubbed her breasts on my chest and kissed me. This was not a casual embrace. Not one where we were kissing, just a long lingering kiss. She started to undulate her hips and felt up and down my chest.</p> <p>"That's very nice," she said as she looked down at the mirror on the wall. "You're a great lay." She leaned in and licked me with her pink tongue.</p> <p>I was still not sure I could cum again. I couldn't have. As her tongue slid up and down my shaft it was like I never thought I would be able to come again. I had a feeling I was going to pass the next stage of this relationship. There was too many negatives and too little to hold anything back. I thought I was going to say things like "I bet you're one of those rich guys," and then I forgot about anything else. She had tasted the wine on my face and down at my erection. It felt good, and the memory of taking the glass of wine to the glass of wine in the bathroom was just too good to stop.</p> <p>She had turned slightly so that my hands were on her ass, and I was squeezing and kneading it with my fingers. I wanted to do it hard. I wanted to push myself further into her. The smell of her sex on my face as she leaned into me with her eyes and mouth, the feeling of the water running into the basin, I knew I was on a course for a long day.</p> <p>My breathing was hard and fast. She was moaning, too. In almost no time we were both sweating. She was still on her knees, but she was rubbing her breasts on me. My hands were still at her cheeks.
