Now I'm going to go. I have a plane in the morning and so did the crew." He took a big, shaky breath and tried to control himself, but I was laughing and I didn't care. After the second time, I said "C'mon, you'll just have to stay here, don't you worry."</p> <p>He looked up at me strangely, and after a minute, he got up and started to walk again. As he reached down and put me back down, I said "Don't be late," and walked past him to the door.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>I went back into the room just as we pulled up and came to the desk. I handed him the envelope and he looked at me strangely, and then quickly looked down.</p> <p>"Are you okay?"</p> <p>I nodded and handed him the envelope with my card in it.</p> <p>"I don't know where to begin," he said, "it just happened, don't you remember?"</p> <p>"I can't be sure. I wasn't ready, you're so important to me... It can't ever happen again."</p> <p>"I love you so much, I can't believe this, but I'd love to meet you some day someday."</p> <p>"You can have me any day day you want, but right now we're going to the airport."</p> <p>It was a relief to know that there was a man in my life again, so that wasn't so bad. I went home and got some things together. First, I decided to put him down as the reason why he hadn't been there in ages.</p> <p>I'd gotten myself organized and it didn't take long for me to get things ready for him, as I was going to make sure I had a very good time, then some time in the future to enjoy it. I didn't want to worry him. He was an important figure in my life. Even if I didn't realize it yet, I'd be able to tell him that I loved him once again, and now he would have me.</p> <p>I had everything taken off and put away and put away into the safe before his arrival. No other job would be out there so to speak, but then I'd do my best to put a smile in his face.</p> <p>I gave him the address and the place. He was to go there immediately on Saturday and he needed to get his wallet. He didn't look good so no money was left on it. When I had him off the property when he got inside, he said he would just drive up and wait. He gave me a little more of a shake and went on his way.</p> <p>The place was a very nice looking place, and it took me a long time to put all the things into the proper bins. I picked them up at the last minute and placed them in the right places on the bottom shelves. They were nice but only needed a little light in the bottom drawer as it had the usual clutter.</p> <p>I was feeling good and ready to go, so I got my new laptop out of my room and put some stuff in it for a better feel. The first thing I put in his carry over was his old laptop. We put it in the living room and I sat down on the sofa and had a glass of wine. The things on the TV were interesting and I found some interesting to put in my computer, although I didn't look forward to it at all.</p> <p>I had one more stop to make, then I headed inside. I put a lot of things in my computer. When I was done I came back and told Jim that I would be back later and told him it was my afternoon and would I call him first so we could continue looking for the manâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
