"Are you ok?" I asked her. She nodded her head. "What's going on?" I asked, confused.</p> <p>"I'm so sorry..." she began and stopped. Finally she looked up at me, "Mike, I'm really sorry. I...I didn't want to do this..if you didn't want to see my, er, my...my stuff...this morning." And with that she leaned toward me and then back to work.</p> <p>My curiosity and curiosity got the best of me and while I was watching my wife slowly unbutton herself, I moved toward her. I held her by the shoulders and pulled her back until almost our entire body was on the floor. She leaned over to help me undo her blouse and I watched as her full breasts became exposed to my view for the first time. I noticed that her nipples were hard as well. I felt her hand brush across my chest and then up to take my dick in her hand. "I think this might get a little uncomfortable..." she murmured as she stroked my manhood. It was then that I noticed she had pulled my shoes off and thrown them on the floor.</p> <p>She was standing in front of me, fully naked, and I wondered if she were wearing a bra or panties. "I don't think I'm ready for this to get out yet," she said, "but...please don't stop..."</p> <p>I moved around so that her back was to me and then moved to kneel next to her on the carpet on my hands and knees. I watched in fascinated as she slowly unzipped and unzipped her pants. I heard the first part of those pants being unzipped. And then I noticed that she had kicked them off to the side. She had left her panties in the car and now they were on the floor with her shoes. "They're off too." I said as I took a hand from her shoulder and guided her hand to hold my dick. She felt it stiffen.</p> <p>Finally she pushed me back on the floor and straddled me, taking my cock in her hand and positioning it at her pussy. She took one of her hands and pulled me tightly into her, sliding me in a few inches and then pulling out almost all the way just then. I felt the head of my dick touch her outer lips and she turned onto her back, exposing my dick for all the world to see. "See?" I asked, "You're not finished." And I pushed my tip just beyond her outer lips. She was still watching the view from the street light above and I pressed my dick up even further, pressing on it as she lifted herself. "I like this" she moaned when I was all the way in. And then we both lowered ourselves until my pubic hair was over hers and it pressed up into the middle. This new position caused the head of my cock to press into her cervix. "Oh, yes," I urged her as I started a steady stroke that would keep her on the edge all morning long. "You're so tight..." I continued as I felt her body tightening under me in response. When I heard her moan, "Mike, I...I can't believe you're doing this." And I knew she wasn't enjoying it when I was doing it. I kept pumping and as I approached orgasm she began to cum again. And again until they were silent and we both just held onto the feelings in both our bodies.</p> <p>We collapsed next to each other on the bed, completely exhausted and completely satisfied. I pulled her close and tried to get her hands in, but she stopped me. "No, Mike, we shouldn't have done that."</p> <p>"Maybe we should get dressed again. Just leave the shoes on," I suggested, "or maybe we should just take a shower."</p> <p>"No, we're fine," she gasped, "We can both shower here when we're done." She moved her hands from my chest and slipped them into her shirt. As she buttoned her shirt she said, "Mike, I'm so happy, I almost want you to kiss me again."</p> <p>"No, no, don't do it." I said softly. I moved my head toward her and she took hold of my head gently. She lifted my chin and then kissed me, not gently and then more passionately than before. When we parted she looked at me, kissed me again, and then said, "Let me give you one last present." Taking my hand she pulled me toward the bathroom and then into the shower to hold me while we were drying off. While we finished brushing our teeth and got ready for bed I asked her, "Why don't just shower together?"</p> <p>"We don't have any towels." she saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
