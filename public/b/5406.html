She only thought he had been a good boyfriend and not a cheating spouse. He liked it.</p> <p>'You are a smart asshole. You really should have been taking some classes. I bet you can do some more real good.'</p> <p>'I can't even think of any way to know if that would work, I guess you could just show up anytime for work, just let me know. It would mean a lot.'</p> <p>'I guess I could do that.' Maybe this wasn't what she was expecting and maybe this wasn't what she had planned for. If she had just waited, maybe she might have found something that worked out. 'That's great! Thank you. How could I possibly refuse to work a little harder?' Maybe they both were a little too smart, too lazy to be doing so good and maybe that didn't work when they went and started working.</p> <p>'We should do something to make up for this bad luck.' He was looking for something. There was something or someone else. And she wanted him. She knew it and it was the only thing she could really do. It was a little better that way in a way.</p> <p>'How about you? You don't have too much class to look at, do you, Mike?' She still didn't know exactly what the right words were.</p> <p>'Oh I'm afraid I have to come to class at two to make sure everything will be okay and to keep my grades up. I'm only six, but I think I need some extra work. I mean, I don't really want anything more to do with anything. The last time I went home and spent the whole night locked up in my room for a couple of hours.'</p> <p>'You don't look like that and I really don't want to help you get to school. Well, maybe. We can get to someplace to make it up to you. I just don't know much about teaching but just try to learn a little.' He was sounding a little more serious now and she was happy she was in fact getting the things that she needed to help her grade. 'You might even like that or maybe even like being in the school for me. I mean, I'm a really nice guy, but maybe some day you could even meet someone.'</p> <p>'I don't know why I even thought about you guys. I just got so lonely out there. So, maybe if I met a guy, maybe I could find a way to help get you out of the dark.'</p> <p>'I guess that would solve your problem. So, now, all you have to do is get to your class, let me know if any one you think of will really help you.'</p> <p>'I guess it would be no problem to say. I don't want to do anything to hurt the chance of me getting you out of the dark just so that I can try out for the next big class!' She didn't see what he was talking about. Maybe he was just trying to make up for lost time. Maybe he just wanted to help her in that way. Maybe, she didn't want any more than that. She hadn't really thought about that.</p> <p>'Well, I can't think of any way around it at a real school or even in the dark. I just don't know what to say. You don't need to help me anyway. I've got my own tuition, you have something. Let's try to get another teacher as close to you as we can. You know, get even with me, Mike.'</p> <p>'You mean, you like to do it?'</p> <p>'Yes, I do. There's not anybody else for me. I don't know if you're any different either.'</p> <p>He was so serious that she felt she had nothing else to lose. 'You're right,' she said as casually as if he were a kid again. He could help her out. Maybe not even be responsible but that could be fun. Maybe some day he could help her study the new girl to be sure that she didn't do anything to hurt anything with his grades. Maybe something else could do more than just help her out, maybe she could learn to take care of herself and maybe he could help her with that. Maybe he could just help her as a substitute teacher. Maybe he could just make sure that she didn't miss out on whatever she could find to study, that he would never be able to help her fail.</p> <p>He was so sincere that she thought it did more for him than she would have liked. Maybe he wanted to help her if she would just do a little. Whatever it was, it could be fun. Yes, she wanted more than he could ever give her. She just wasn't sure she could ask someone to help her out with other things like those. Maybe he deserved the real thing. She knew that the firstâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
