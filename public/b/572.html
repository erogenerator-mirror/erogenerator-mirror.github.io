Right now I'm at home, relaxing."</p> <p>"How is your mother?"</p> <p>"I think I need to check on the new developments with the two of you. I may need to visit you," she smiled.</p> <p>He got up to leave and called the police department as she was talking on the phone to her mother. The three friends were in the lobby after about fifteen minutes waiting for their mother to answer the call. The officer came out to get them, looking at the detective with a frown.</p> <p>"You're a good cop, officer," said the officer as he checked his clipboard.</p> <p>"Thanks. If you get this man in court, he will be charged with a murder. The prosecutor says he's a former member, and a self-defense attorney. So I can't really recommend any more charges."</p> <p>The policeman smiled and asked, "Where should I go for bail money?"</p> <p>"My lawyer will probably be up to me. I can show you where you will be arraigned for the trial, and I'll call you later."</p> <p>"Thank you. I love to help."</p> <p>He picked up his car keys from the ground and followed the detective into the police station, where he parked at a side entrance. The detective walked around in front of the desk and picked them up. The detective sat the keys on the desk.</p> <p>"If there is anything special that your lawyer can do, please mail it to me as soon as you can. He will write it up for you, on a notarized form. I will sign for your bail, please."</p> <p>The detective got out of the car. He walked back to the car to open the door for the woman.</p> <p>"Thank you very much. This is my car," the detective added with a grin. He gave the car keys for the woman to follow and walked back into the office.</p> <p>"I have your lawyer's number in my cell," the detective said. "He wants me to call."</p> <p>It took him several minutes to return the car to the parking area in front of the house. He gave his car keys to the woman to follow. She stepped across the porch with her arm open for him. He leaned over the foyer and helped her up to stand again. He opened her door for her and guided her into the house. The police woman stepped into the foyer, closed the door and got in his car while the detective followed in behind.</p> <p>It was late at night before their neighbors, Jack and Karen, came into the house. The detectives saw a light going on in their living room, so they went in and sat at their computers for a couple of hours. They had just logged into the Internet and found a couple of new accounts for their attorney's, so they did this. They found some other items, including some new financial information concerning their boss. Jack and Karen spent most of their time in each other's arms. The detective kept watching to see if Jack and his wife noticed. The detective did. He even got an idea that he may have been doing too. At the end of their work hours, Jack was surprised when Karen called into the bedroom after everyone had gone into the other room and had sex.</p> <p>"This is something new," she said. She kissed Jack on the lips and walked over to meet him. Jack's eyes went wide as she slipped her tongue between his lips and kissed him deeply. She could taste the juices of both their sex into his mouth. She looked into his eyes, and he saw her watching him, waiting to see his reaction. Jack was nervous and excited and eager for her to go further.</p> <p>"It's all right," she said, as she took him by the hand and led him to the guest bedroom. She unbuttoned and removed her dress. Jack saw that he was undressing her and he could hardly wait to feel her skin. The man's penis was hard and long and thick. Jack kissed Karen deeply as he slid his hand into her panties to stroke her. He slid her panties down her legs and knelt down to pull them down and off her legs. He then kissed her naked bottom as she lay there naked next to him. He turned around and kissed her bottom again as he reached under the bed and got his belt and panties off the floor. He got off the bed to grab the waistband of his pants.</p> <p>He kissed the backs of Karen's thighs, working them out of their slacks until they were free. He pushed both their pants down and off of them. Karen lifted the front of her legs to help him pull them down to where they were folded over so that her knees were on her chest. He rubbed his cock a few times up and down her wet folds, teasing her wetness.</p> <p>"Please fuck me," she gasped.</p> <p>Jack stepped over the endâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
