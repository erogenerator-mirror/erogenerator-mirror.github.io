Then I felt a cool breeze as she pulled my head up by my pony tail and then her lips kissed me. I felt her tongue press between my lips and taste the sweetness of my lip gloss. She kissed me again, and gently pushed me down on the bed. Her body lay on top of mine and I felt both her lips and her breasts on my face. Her tongue slid out to tease my lips again as she ran it across between my lips, and then she softly sucked on my bottom lip before pulling her head back and smiling wickedly. After several minutes, we laid naked and on the bed for several hours.</p> <p>I have no idea how long it was before we finally went to sleep. I awoke still naked, she was still sleeping, and my hands found their way to her warm bare breast. Her nightgown was still on, as was hers and I fondled one. The feeling between her legs was amazing. She rolled over toward me as I kissed and caressed her breasts, finally sucking her swollen nipples into my mouth as I ran my hand between her legs. Her hand pulled my hand from her breasts and rubbed my face, her breathing began to quicken. She began to moan louder as she kissed my face before pulling my lips to her in a gentle kiss. Her hips began to rock against my fingers as I continued to kiss her breasts until she became impatient for me to give her a climax. I gently pushed her back, as I had done with her breasts, and we both rose from the bed. I lifted her legs and spread them to bring her thighs out of the way, before sliding my cock into her waiting and pulsating pussy. It was as if we were both in sync with each other. I continued to thrust in and out of her as she raised my legs in the air on her outstretched arms and her legs opened to grant both access. She began to moan and gasp as my cock slid in and out of her. With each thrust I could feel my balls slapping with her pubic bone. Her lips were on my chin before I could suck her clit, as I knew I wouldn't be able to last long. I could feel her muscles clenching on my prick as she orgasmed almost as soon as her pussy released her juice all over my cock.</p> <p>As she lay recovering, I felt her hands reaching up to caress my balls and to pull my cock from deep inside her cunt. Without letting my own release, she brought her pussy to my face and licked it. I licked hers, our combined juices mingled with mine and she tasted wonderful. She slowly moved around on the bed as I kissed my way back to her hips and thighs and kissed up them.</p> <p>I took her left ankle between my lips and licked up one side and down the other of her thigh. I licked her outer lips and pressed the flat of my tongue just inside her lips. I moved my tong down and began to stroke her inner lips with my tongue, gently sucking on each lip. This caused her to cry out with pleasure. I sucked on her lips again, as far as the lips would allow. This elicited a small squeal.</p> <p>I began to tease her clit. Using just the tip of my tongue, I slowly took it between my teeth to lightly flick it as it stood like a rock. The sensation made her sigh, as it was now time to bring me out of my own sleep. I sucked her clit, drawing it between my lips. Soon she felt herself being pushed up to a sitting position as I continued to flick it, my tongue continuing to flick it ever so lightly. She began to buck herself as her breath became faster and faster. Her eyes rolled back into her head as her whole body began to shake as she let out one long loud animal like moan. She went on humping herself in a frenzy as I sucked her clit.</p> <p>My lips and tongue worked her clit. Her body moved against the bed as I slowly sucked on her clit, drawing it and then releasing it. Her moans and whimpers were like music to my ears and her pussy was still pulsating. Soon I stopped for a moment allowing her to calm down for a while, as still she continued to run her hands over my face and down my neck and chest. When she lay beside me, still breathing slightly shallow, I could feel the orgasm still rolling over me as I lay beside her with her leg still draped over me. She slowly moved to rest her head on my shoulder. We lay there, both exhausted, her head in my neck and my hand on her breast. I could feel her heartbeat pulsate between us, again and again. We lay there for a long time, until she moved her hand to rest on my chest. We smiled to each other, just briefly, before getting up to get a drink of water, as she did soâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
