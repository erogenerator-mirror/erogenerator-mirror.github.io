Thanks."</p> <p>He took her by the hand and led her quickly through the halls and down towards the office building.</p> <p>"It's only a mile down that corridor." he told me when he finished his conversation with me.</p> <p>"And when we're both inside this place I think it'll be nice," he said with a grin.</p> <p>"Thanks, I thought I heard someone."</p> <p>He laughed and led her in, as she was ushered in through to his office there was a small room that appeared to be used for a large work camp.</p> <p>He closed and locked the door behind them and stood back, looking at the girl lying on his desk. She was wearing a long, tight black silk nightie and stockings. And the bottom half was totally covered in black leather.</p> <p>In front of her desk on the big leather couch was a small black leather sofa. A black padded chair was propped under a TV screen on the wall, so she couldn't possibly fall asleep. On a small table against the back was a plate of chocolate chip cookies she could easily have gotten on a plate and eaten on her own, but she'd decided what she wanted to drink and didn't want to make any fuss over anything else.</p> <p>"Sit down and relax as we talk shall we first."</p> <p>"Oh hi Dave."</p> <p>She had stopped sucking him and was looking down from his eyes.</p> <p>"Just call me Mike, I mean as such you are already my brother," he said with a slight laugh.</p> <p>"It makes me feel so special, but I guess I'm afraid of being rude," she replied.</p> <p>"Is that so?"</p> <p>He came over and lifted her chin up so that she was looking into his eyes. "Just because I'm old doesn't mean you can't be honest with me. And I'm sure that you're not just wondering what's in there besides having a small turd down there for food."</p> <p>He paused and then reached out and grabbed her right breast with a finger in between her breasts. She had to stop sucking him to gasp.</p> <p>"God yes, you're gorgeous." He looked into her eyes momentarily before moving her onto her back. "Now if you lie down on the sofa and spread your legs so that I can get underneath you."</p> <p>He knelt down just over her crotch. He could see just a glistening of moisture on her lips and he knew that she liked to have her pussy eaten. He reached up and pushed her knees apart and then leaned in so that his face was level with her pussy. He could smell her sweetness and he could also smell the sweat and sex juices that leaked out of her. He wanted to just go ahead and get started before she had a chance to recover from what she had just done and was now about to do to her.</p> <p>"Well I could lick you just for a few minutes just to test your reaction."</p> <p>"Yes please, pleaseâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
