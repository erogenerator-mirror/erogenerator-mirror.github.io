You're my hero and you made me smile."</p> <p>"I'm glad that you're taking things slowly."</p> <p>He chuckled as he began to nibble lightly on her neck.</p> <p>"You're being such a darling. I have to confess that I'm worried that my dick will tear itself free."</p> <p>"You might want to relax now. You'll enjoy this. I'm going to make you very happy."</p> <p>He took her head and guided it down. His face was buried in her hair and he began to gently kiss it. He kissed and licked her neck making her squirm against the sheets. He nibbled on her earlobe and whispered, "I love you. I love you too." He pressed her against him and began to gently, almost painfully, grind his hips against her.</p> <p>Carrie loved the feel of him inside her. "I can't believe how I feel right now."</p> <p>John began to whisper in her ear, "What's wrong with you?"</p> <p>"Nothing really."</p> <p>"I know you feel the same way because, well, as we're going to be in bed."</p> <p>Carrie sat up and kissed him. "Why? What's wrong?"</p> <p>"Oh, I don't know." John looked a little embarrassed as he spoke. "I guess that I just kind of wanted it to happen this way."</p> <p>Carrie sat up and looked at him. "I want it too."</p> <p>He laughed. "Just a little bit. The way we have been...uh...being so gentle and loving. Does that make sense?"</p> <p>"As your hero, I want you to get comfortable. You've got a beautiful body and I've got a sweet mind. And I haven't cum yet either."</p> <p>"But you're still a little boy."</p> <p>"No I'm not, but I do enjoy being with you, and you're making me very happy."</p> <p>"Is that a problem?"</p> <p>"No, I think it's pretty exciting."</p> <p>John kissed the top of her head and then turned her to face him. "I can't say I find you sexually desirable." He kissed her.</p> <p>She laughed as she sat up and said, "I don't think I ever liked being with you."</p> <p>"You're not the first woman that I've met who wouldn't go down on me."</p> <p>"I wish you didn't have to." This time she was deadly serious. "You know that you can't say no to a lover."</p> <p>A light went off in John's head.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"I mean that, I don't have to tell you. I have to be honest and say that I enjoyed everything I did with you."</p> <p>"I guess that counts."</p> <p>"You're right."</p> <p>"Okay," John said, "so what now?"</p> <p>"There's only one place we can be in bed."</p> <p>"Oh?"</p> <p>"Yeah, there's a place that you've never been."</p> <p>"What's that?"</p> <p>"There's a place where, between us."</p> <p>There was no arguing with that.</p> <p>John climbed on top of her and she wrapped her legs around his waist and pulled him in.</p> <p>"I love you." He was grinning as he took her in his arms.</p> <p>"I love you too."</p> <p>The next day at work were a little different. There were no more meetings than usual, or in public. Carried away were the various meetings or presentations that the team made before their meetings ended. There was no one else to talk to. Nobody else in the office even glanced at the clock. The only thing that went through John's mind when he and Carrie were going to be in bed was her. They were going to do it.</p> <p>The only change was that it would be different now. It would be all about her. She had decided to leave. And she had left John alone. She had left him and for a moment it felt like she was just going to disappearâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
