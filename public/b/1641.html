We went about in the other room to finish our drinks and when we walked back to the bedroom I couldn't stop thinking about her and what just happened. I couldn't take my mind off of her every time I looked at her. It was too much. I took a few paces up the stairs and took her by the hand and she followed me. She grabbed the bottom of my shirt and pulled it up and over my head exposing my body to her. She leaned in and kissed me deeply and started unbuttoning and unzipping my pants. I kissed her hard down her neck and down her chest as we walked to the bedroom to get our clothes off together. We walked quickly the three steps to the bed and she dropped to her knees and slowly pulled my pants off and tossed them to the hamper.</p> <p>She reached up and took the head of my cock into her mouth, and started sucking very hungrily on just the head. She ran her tongue all around the head of my cock and sucked softly into her mouth as she slowly slid my cock into her mouth. I pulled her up by the shoulders and kissed her right on the lips. She broke the kiss and looked to me for approval.</p> <p>"Fuck her," she said in a breathy voice "Fuck her hard!"</p> <p>I stepped back from her and pulled my shirt off quickly, then pushed up her skirt. She stood there with a very sexy look on her face. It was amazing that I'd spent so much time fantasizing about her, even if only for a couple of hours. She was soaking wet as I entered her and immediately began kissing her again.</p> <p>"Oh yes!" she moaned "Fuck me, Steve"</p> <p>We kissed some more as I leaned her into the headboard and she wrapped her legs around me and started grinding her hips against mine. She started moaning and thrusting against me harder, as if she was trying to have a second orgasm while we did it. She was so wet and slick and so slippery that we easily slid easily into her, and we started thrusting with wild abandon as I started banging her hard against the headboard. Faster and harder, she grabbed at my ass and squeezed me hard, but it felt so wonderful. I was going to lose it soon too.</p> <p>"Are you going to cum," I whispered into her ear.</p> <p>"Oh yes," she said "I'm going to," and she grabbed me tight and ground her hips into mine. "Oh god Steve!" she groaned "Cum with me"</p> <p>I grabbed her around the hips and gave her just enough time to pull out of her and take a big breath. We stood there, panting and breathing hard for a moment, as we caught our breath. We slowly started to fall to the bed and she fell on top of me and her tits pressed into my chest.</p> <p>We lay there for a while, neither of us wanting to move, just feeling each other's warmth and being completely in each other's arms. We finally rolled over onto my back and she rolled on top of me. She straddled the headboard and looked at me. We kissed several times before she crawled upwards. We kissed long and wet before she started to lower herself onto me. I wasn't sure what she was going to do with her legs but she didn't stop kissing me, I could feel her heat and her wetness and it made the whole experience seem so intense.</p> <p>"Are you sure you can do this," I said</p> <p>"This is really my first time" she replied, "I know you will love it. I've been waiting a long time for this time, and now that it's here I couldn't be happier. I want to fuck you so hard and hard you won't be able to walk for a few days!"</p> <p>And she did. I could barely feel her through the sheet, but she was so hot and so wet I couldn't hold back. I could feel her vagina muscles contracting around my cock inside of her as she sat on top of me.</p> <p>She collapsed on my chest and we lay there for a long time savoring the feeling of our bodies touching, just one person. I could feel myself going soft in her and realized we just came in the night. I didn't realize that she was even more turned on than before, when we were kissing our lovemaking had only been a light kiss. I guess she wasn't sure how much she wanted this to happen, but she didn't stop as she started humping up and down onto me at her pace. She was gasping a little as she rode me with determination and determination that was so intense, until I finally rolled her over and we kissed.</p> <p>Afterwards we rolled to our sides together and looked at each other.</p> <p>"I'll never forget thisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
