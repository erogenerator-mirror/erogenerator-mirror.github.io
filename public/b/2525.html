I reached up and grabbed his ears, pulling him down even further. His breathing deepened and a shudder went through me. His hot breath burned my cheek. I slid my hands up over his head and rested them behind his head and he slowly turned his head toward me, still gripping tightly to my cheek. He kissed my forehead and then the top of my eyelid, his lips brushing my ear, and kissed it lightly on the underside of it and then leaned down again, pressing a hot kiss to the back of my neck. His fingers tightened again.</p> <p>God, I was wet.</p> <p>I opened my eyes, gazing into his face and he smiled before looking back up. He smiled then. This time.</p> <p>He leaned in toward me, putting his knee down, and I reached up with my arms to wrap my arms around him. He wrapped his arms around me and I tilted my face upward toward his and we kissed. It was a long, slow, hungry, hungry, passion filled kiss. He drew away from us.</p> <p>"Don't get me wrong. We're not done yet, kitten," he said. He was grinning now and he put a hand on my cheek and kissed my forehead, right shoulder to the right and I watched it drop and the side of his face and the top of his ear, and I felt his fingers move. He had a finger in my slit and he started playing with me.</p> <p>"Hmmmm," I managed to choke out, the sound barely audible above the noise of the rain. He pulled away and pulled up his shirt. I reached down with my tongue, tasting as he did and found my lips opened wetly just before his finger had left my wetness. I ran my tongue around the ring, and he said, "Just the tip." I nodded, and felt him lean towards me and he kissed me again. I felt his hand slide up my leg and he felt around my inner thigh and then up the other thigh, then up the other leg at the same time. I opened my knees a bit to accommodate him, and he lifted my leg to his lap and he started pulling down his pants. By now I was trembling, and felt his cock pressing up against his thigh and he grabbed my leg and pulled me up, and as he sat up to release me, I felt the tip of his swollen member at the entrance to me.</p> <p>I arched my back off the couch, and he ran his finger over the entrance to my wet slit, wetting it up before he gently pushed into me. We moved together, rhythmically working our hips. With long, smooth strokes, he moved up and down against me. I grabbed at his butt, pulling him down closer to me and kissed him again. His lips were soft and warm against mine and I licked my own lips as we continued to move. I moaned softly, and he groaned.</p> <p>My eyes wandered to a nearby wall. I moved my hips slightly and ran my fingers through his hair. I ran my fingers through his hair, and I leaned into him, putting my hands on his sides and leaning against him and rubbing myself against him, moaning as we moved, his hand now in his pocket, and pushing down on me.</p> <p>Just before I was sure I was going to come, I felt him thrust into me hard, hard and fast and the sound of his hips hitting mine echoed through the apartment. I bit my lip and moaned as my orgasm rushed forth from between my legs and washed over me. I couldn't help it, and felt myself shudder against him as he buried himself into me and felt my walls convulse around his throbbing tool. He held himself there, still embedded inside me, but my orgasm subsiding and he pulled out and sat up.</p> <p>"That was the best fuck I have had in years," he said. With my head resting on his shoulder, I looked up at him. He looked over toward me from the wall. His fingers traced up my face and down my neck. I rolled toward him, pulling my knees to my chest. He leaned up and kissed me softly on the lips. He was a bit worried, but he didn't say anything. He wrapped my arms around my body and held me back to the wall for a second and looked over to ceiling again.</p> <p>"You were amazing," he said. I looked up at him, a little worried.</p> <p>"I don't mean to be too harsh," I laughed, "but we need to be honest." I smiled at him and he leaned up and kissed me again. I wrapped my arms around his head against my body and let him pull my lips to his and kiss me in the way he'd always done with me. We slowly pulled away, and he laid me down beside him. I leaned up against himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
