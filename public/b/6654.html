"It's always easier with someone who's prepared to use her skills for other people."</p> <p>The more she looked at me the more I wanted to laugh, but couldn't get the thought out of my head. I was going to ask her all kinds of questions; how could I ask anything she wouldn't do herself? Then it occurred to me again that she was probably doing all the thinking.</p> <p>I'd been standing there, watching and listening for her for what seemed like an eternity, when suddenly a soft noise and a gasp broke my reverie.</p> <p>"Oh-o-o-o..." she murmured, her eyes wide as she looked up at me. I looked down and saw a slight pink flush spreading across the exposed portion of her neck.</p> <p>"Ahhhh," I groaned and reached up and wiped a bead of sweat from one of her eyes. I quickly grabbed both sides of her shirt and pulled it off her before we actually got her into the house. As soon as her breasts were exposed her nipples seemed to push through the fabric, poking and begging.</p> <p>"That's enough for now," I whispered as I quickly shed my shirt, then dropped my pants, which were already laying around my ankles. I stood there, waiting as she stripped herself. For the first time since the accident, she seemed to be really hesitant about stripping, but her eyes seemed to shift to my dick, which she quickly caught up with her free hand.</p> <p>"Well," she said, a slight frown on her pretty face. "I'm sure you're anxious about something."</p> <p>I glanced down. "Um..." was all I could manage.</p> <p>She grinned. "I'm excited about another turn now," she said, and slipped two fingers between her lips. I watched the muscles around her mouth and tongue twitch and strain, almost as if she wanted to be sucked off. Her fingers began to move in short, fast circles, and it didn't take her long for her lips to clench.</p> <p>"Yeah," I said, as she started to get up and turn around, but instead slipped two of her fingers into me, holding them there while they jerked up and down me, her thumb just brushing my nipple. She took a step forward and sat down on the small ledge, then twisted the hand holding my cock up to position herself. I was so sensitive that I jumped for a second as she lowered herself with me, but once I was in, I was quickly in again.</p> <p>After a few moments of having her up on me, and her hand pumping on me with my dick just inside her, I started to feel myself get close.</p> <p>"Cum for me," I commanded, and it was like a knife to my heart to know she meant it, but it only made the need in my body intensify.</p> <p>She looked into my eyes, and saw the heat and heat building up inside me, and I felt my muscles tense and pulse.</p> <p>"Oh god," I groaned, and jerked, pumping ropes of cum deep into her. It must have hurt a little; it was like everything just rushed out of the head of me.</p> <p>It occurred to me for a moment that this was probably just our second round, and I thought we still had time to go back to our house... and that, if we took another turn, we could maybe skip our next session. But then I realized that while we were in front of that door, we wouldn't be able to go back upstairs... and maybe we could take a turn. Or another turn... maybe I could be left alone for a few more minutes, and we could just stay in and enjoy the moment?</p> <p>"I can't tell," she smiled at me over the white-hot cum still running down her leg, a bit of it running down between her legs. "I guess I want this to be special."</p> <p>She started to push on me again, and I grabbed her wrist. "It really is a special moment," I told her, and started to slowly fuck her again.</p> <p>Her eyes got half-open, and for a moment I thought we were in trouble. When I grabbed her hand again and turned to pick up the pace, she seemed to think we should stop, and her eyes pleaded with me. I was half-delirious with arousal, and didn't want to make any more mistakes than I had already made.</p> <p>"Let's go inside," I told her, and she nodded. She got up and ran to the couch, where she collapsed down onto it. Before she could get it to recline, I had already flipped her over and had started to fuck her again. I quickly lost the rhythm of this until she grabbed me to put me inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
