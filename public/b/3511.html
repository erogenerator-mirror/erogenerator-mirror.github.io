"I'm almost there, baby, I'm almost there. I'm so close.... Yessss." His thrusts were in tune with her mouth--and her lips. She sucked gently and moved her head up and down, swirling her tongue around him. Her hands came to his ass, and she kneaded it firmly. Her lips closed over his cockhead, and he gasped, arching his back. She sucked in and out, stroking him with her mouth as her hand rubbed him. He groaned and began to twitch, thrusting up into her mouth.</p> <p>Calia's hand slipped up his leg, and she ran it over his balls. She squeezed and pumped, and stroked his cock as she sucked on him.</p> <p>"Oh, babe, yesssss," he whimpered, "oh, babe, yesssss, I'm so close.... Ahhhhhhhhhh.... Yessss.... Yessss.... Yesssss.... Fucking... Ahhhhhhhhh..... Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh.... Yessss..." he hissed, his voice muffled by the pleasure of her mouth on him.</p> <p>His body arched, his face went flustered, his hips thrust violently. Cum exploded from his dick into her mouth. He thrust a few more times, just a little more, then he slumped back, panting. His penis slipped from her mouth, and he leaned forwards against the couch, arms and legs akimbo. "Mmmpphhh..... yessssss." he panted out. His hand went down to her hair.</p> <p>"Mmm," murmured Calia, "so good. Is that nice?"</p> <p>He nodded. Her hand was in her lap, rubbing idly. "It's so good," he said. "It would never feel as good if I just couldn't." His cock bobbed again. "Ah, God . . ."</p> <p>His fingers pressed up between them. His hand moved to her chest, rubbing it. "Calia," he hissed down at her, "no, no," he shook his head. "I think I might be asleep."</p> <p>"Well, you are. You just want to lay there? There's some bedding down there for you to use." He laughed. "It just may be worth it." Calia smiled. "So, you're on the pill?"</p> <p>"Nah, but that doesn't sound like the way to go." He grinned. "And I haven't been with anyone since your mom..." She kissed him for a while, and then pulled back. "Well, I should be at least two. Now you're going to bed."</p> <p>"O, okay," he said, grinning. "Thanks, babe, that was a great idea."</p> <p>He kissed her on the lips, then made to get up. Calia stopped him and gently took him by the hand. "No, let's go to bed," she said. "You have dinner in your room when I come home. See you in the morning."</p> <p>Might be worth it, if he's still awake, I thinkâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
