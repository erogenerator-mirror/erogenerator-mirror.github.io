She smiled as she turned around to look at him and felt her own juices start to drip from her wet pussy, knowing that he was right. He was right, too. It would be better if she had let someone feel her up and she knew who it was. "So, are we finished?" she said, "And can I have a taste of my pussy?" She said, looking over her shoulder over her shoulder at her husband. He nodded, and Beth led him over to the edge of the tub and sat him down on a bench between the hot tub and the open deck. The room was very luxurious with candles placed along the walls on both sides and a large sofa set in one corner. Beth reached out to touch his shoulder, causing Dave to look over to the other person, but she didn't move. Dave continued to read his book but couldn't focus on anything else. He heard Beth, move back to the table and make herself a drink. She came back with a margarita and he heard the bubbling water splash out. "Now, just relax and I will make you feel better if you sit a little lower." Beth said as she finished making the drink. Dave was happy to have his attention on Beth but was also concerned that he should stop touching himself and get more comfortable in this tub. The water felt wonderful as it cascaded around him and he started to relax a bit. "Dave, you have a lot to learn if I don't stop now" Beth said as she moved closer to him so she could sit closer. She leaned over to kiss him softly on the lips as she brought her body down to his body and pushed her tongue inside his mouth. It was a tender moment, but Dave's cock was already beginning to throb in response as Beth took his hand and placed it onto her breast and he took both of them in his hands to begin to rub the material covering her breasts. She moaned softly and arched in response. "I like that, Dave" and he quickly took both of her breasts in his hands and began to feel them. He squeezed and pinched her nipples between his fingers as he continued to roll her nipples between his thumbs and fingernails. "Oh, God, that felt good." Beth moaned "I have wanted you to do that for as long as I could remember." Dave didn't know what to think as he continued to fondle her breasts and he quickly brought the hand that he had moved back to her stomach, under the water. He started moving it downward as he continued to feel her breasts, and he could tell as she felt him she was moving toward him. Beth could feel his erection and knew she had made a mistake in not going down on him, so she sat up completely and pushed him back on the bench and moved herself on top of him. She lifted one leg and pushed it along his thighs and sat down on his cock which was now rock hard as he watched her. She leaned forward, taking his hands and putting them on her breasts. He moved his hands down to her waist and cupped her round ass and lifted her up until the tip of his cock had almost disappeared into her wet pussy. As she sat on him he felt the warmth of her body. She moved her hips as she moved her legs up and down and her hair cascaded down over the tops of his thighs. His body was moving slightly up and down her thigh as she moved them up and down. He squeezed her breasts together as they were getting closer to the top of her body. He moved his hands up to her shoulders and rubbed the material of her long black dress as her breasts started to move forward again. "That felt great, Beth" Dave said softly. "I love being with you, Beth". She responded, taking his right hand in hers and placing it on her left breast. He squeezed it and then took her nipple in his mouth and his tongue flicked across it. He could feel his own excitement increase as he felt how she was responding to what he was doing. He could hear her breathing heavier as he knew the time was now. He lifted her off of him and pushed her back onto the cold deck. he moved his hands up to her breasts and then moved his fingers over her nipples until one of them was hard and he could see that it was becoming harder. Beth felt his hard cock pushing against her wet pussy and felt him slide a little further inside her. She closed her eyes and moaned as his cock pushed the end inside her. She felt his hands move down to her ass, and his fingers played with the string of her panties between his thumbs and forefinger. "How do those feel?" he asked in the softest voice he could muster. Beth could only nod in responseâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
