He had been working on this for a while, and he was ready for it.</p> <p>"I'm always happy to help my family." she replied.</p> <p>The two men exchanged kisses in front of the others and left together.</p> <p>The ride home was uneventful, but it was not to be. They talked for hours; he was glad for the break, as it showed that he was the right man.</p> <p>They made it back on time; they would take the rest of the way back at the same time, but it would be a few minutes before they had time to talk again.</p> <p>She pulled her skirt and panties out before she unlocked the door and started for it. As she ran to the car, it hit her in the stomach as she turned and saw him standing there with a large grin on his face.</p> <p>"I was wondering when you were going to get back. I have a surprise planned." They began kissing, feeling each other's lips.</p> <p>"I want you so much. It feels like I've dreamed of this for years."</p> <p>"You know that I have to leave, so can you let me come in for a minute?"</p> <p>"Sure, I'll be back in a minute."</p> <p>She quickly took off and opened the door of the car and got in.</p> <p>"I missed you," she said.</p> <p>He said, "I missed you too."</p> <p>They spent another hour and then stopped at the diner, where they got breakfast on the patio instead.</p> <p>"Do you remember how I used to make a special request for some food, and we would go out to my car after our second date?"</p> <p>"Yes, I remember."</p> <p>A few minutes later, they were back at her car in the garage.</p> <p>"I told my parents that you were not coming back, so I had to take all my things."</p> <p>The next morning was no different. He did not stop driving, but instead asked if she would like him to come on back to his home.</p> <p>"It's not that, I just need you for some time. So, will you come back to my place?" he asked. She was stunned.</p> <p>"I mean, come on."</p> <p>"Sure, I want to go some more."</p> <p>This was too much, she agreed. "Fine, I will come. We can start from tomorrow, okay?"</p> <p>He agreed and pulled on her seat, and they headed back to the apartment.</p> <p>"I can't wait to show you."</p> <p>"Well, I guess that we should change our plans." as she was talking she was stroking his erection, making him harder.</p> <p>They finished breakfast and moved out.</p> <p>"Would you like something to drink, when we get home?"</p> <p>When they came home, they decided on a cup of Merlot, and sat at the breakfast table, talking about the night before. The last thing she said before she went to bed turned on was how exciting it was to have an 8 in her hand as they stood by each other as she touched and kissed it. She was in her thong panties, ready and willing herself to do this as she rubbed the head against her panties, before she let herself slide down as he pressed it against her slit. They both fell asleep in their sleep, each feeling more content as it went on.</p> <p>They awoke on Sunday morning to the sounds of heavy rain coming through the windows.</p> <p>He said, "It's over lunch and we should stop to eat. I really wanted to talk to you about tomorrow, but I can't."</p> <p>She gave him a quick kiss, before walking out the door, knowing he would come home tonight.</p> <p>They had sex that night at least two more times, that night his hand on her ass as she rubbed his cock as he fingered her asshole for a few minutes. They fell asleep, holding each other, making love that nightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
