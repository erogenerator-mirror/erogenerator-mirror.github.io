"This is so wrong and wonderful, this is so wrong and so, so right." I leaned my forehead down, breathing deeply, then my lips closed around his neck, and as a result, there was no more feeling between us. Slowly, with his head falling back onto the pillow in my lap, he turned to lie beside me.</p> <p>The next thing I knew, we were kissing again. He put his hand over my shoulder. "Oh, Chris," he said, softly. "It's so sexy." He had put his hand on my cheek, and we were nose-to-nose, our lips touching, and his hand traced my arm, which was still cradling his shoulder-blond breast. I put my hand under his chin and gently pulled him down onto me. His lips, soft and soft, touched mine, and, as the kiss started, we were a bit surprised at how aroused we both were when his tongue started caressing my lips and then into me. It was all it took for me to be suddenly a bit of a wild girl, a bit of a woman, the kind of person I had always been, or so I had thought. And then, as I felt his kisses and the softness of his tongue against mine, my whole body went slack. It was that simple. I wrapped my legs around his waist, and we started to rhythmically move our lips apart. I could feel the pressure that had already started building and the need to have it taken away. It seemed to happen only after the kiss, when the tension left me in a second. It was such an errant, all-consuming moment in between kissing, and it lasted longer than it should have. We could have been kissing for as long as we wanted.</p> <p>Finally, when the kiss got too strong, we separated. I gave a kind of pained moan, and we both turned to look at each other. There I was, a sexy creature who knew how to take advantage as far as it was ok, and knew how to keep a man's heart and mind from being a little less. My lips moved to kiss his shoulder. Our mouths met and we started to kiss again, just a little longer, just a little bit more, our hands running around each other's cheeks again, and just a second longer this time. And the feeling, the feeling of him, was more intense than when we kissed. It was like my head was swimming just a little more, and I wanted him inside of me, and this time, it was good; it felt wonderful, and I wanted more. There was no more hesitation.</p> <p>I pushed him back and crawled off of him. It was as simple as that, but now I knew everything about who I was: how I could have my best friend, a wife with whom I hadn't had sex in several years, a mother who made me feel young and attractive and complete, someone who I could share my life with for hours and nights, who I could talk to with my husband's voice. I was alluring. I was irresistible. But I needed more.</p> <p>I lay next to him, holding him in my arms, and I could feel his hand on mine, on my thigh. The contact made me feel so good, it seemed to radiate, and I was lost in it, and I wanted it to go on. He rolled over toward me, spooning my body. His cock was pressing into my lower thigh, and the fact that he had started it off and had now found its way between the crack of my ass, was enough to set me off. I gave a soft cry, and he could feel how wet I was getting. I knew what he wanted. I pushed my hips down toward him, and he had the answer. "I'm in bed with you," I said, as he lay beside me, cock now at the ready. I leaned over and kissed him softly on his lips, then the back of his neck as I moved downward toward his chest. In a quiet voice, I told him that I wanted to feel all of him inside of me, that a man's cock inside of me was better than anyone else's, that I was ready to be taken, that I wanted to feel those feelings again, that I wanted him to feel things to him they had only done for years. I wanted him to be my lover, and I wanted him to fill me with his sperm. And then I moved over him, and let my face brush against his face. When I had turned toward him, he took my chin in his hand and turned my face toward his, our breaths mingled, and his lips came down on mine. When our lips touched, it was electric, and I shivered with delight. I let his handâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
