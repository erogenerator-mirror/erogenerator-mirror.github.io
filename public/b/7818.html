You can't really hurt yourself with that sort of thing."</p> <p>We finished and cleaned up the table and then she went to the closet and got the big wooden box. We each took a piece of paper and held them up and held them together. There was a tiny writing pad on one.</p> <p>"It is the instructions for the 'torture'. I've written them down from their first letter to their next letters. Now I want both of you to take them back. Put them in some type of bag and make sure to put your clothes back on before we get started here. We'll see what kind of trouble we can get into here."</p> <p>I was looking at all these instructions and thought, "What kind of trouble is he's in?"</p> <p>I walked back and forth to the closet while we spoke. I could see that both of them were looking at the pad. I could see a slight blush on Laura's face but nothing could be seen from them. We had walked past all those people and were looking at the pad. I guess that the embarrassment, the embarrassment, had been enough for her to feel better since.</p> <p>I made sure both of them were in it and then turned to leave.</p> <p>I asked Laura and Joann if they had everything they needed for a couple of nights. They both blushed but nodded in agreement. I opened the door and got myself a drink so we could get the girls out of there. As always, they were looking at the pad with the instructions on the pad, the little pad with nothing else. I was surprised that these two had such a small pad. I walked to the back and looked up at them. Both of them were standing about an inch from me and both had that cute smile that had only a woman's smile, but one that I knew was genuine.</p> <p>I looked over at the other girls who seemed to be talking quietly. Joann got up and looked at her watch. "Let's get her off the table and off into the bedroom." I helped Laura out of there then moved back to the front of the room and waited as she walked back behind me.</p> <p>We had finished drinking and I had her get on the table. "We've got to do something with the girls this evening but you are going to have to be very careful. They are very pretty but not as beautiful as you are." She pulled Joann's hair, turned her head and put her nose in her ear and then turned to me. "I'm sure that both of you would like to see me with them and in them but not together."</p> <p>I smiled at her and said, "Don't worry, both of you will love it as much as I do."</p> <p>I walked back and held the robe and she reached into one of the bags and pulled out each of the things I had made earlier and handed them to her.</p> <p>I went over to the bed and she sat down and patted the bed. She put one end with the instructions on it and then looked at me and smiled before she went to the other and put them on the bed. I helped her up then sat down too.</p> <p>I looked up at Joann, "Do you want to go with us?" I asked.</p> <p>She nodded and started to get out of the robe then looked back to me and smiled. "I feel like a kid once more, but I'm not interested in getting my way."</p> <p>I shrugged, "The girl who has made the contract doesn't have to be as pretty as you."</p> <p>She looked at me, "Why thank you, but yes, of course I would love to go with you." She got out the small pad and held up the instructions for this time; I opened my envelope and started to read it. Joann looked at her as she was reading but did not say anything. I opened the paper and read the contract. There were 3 different parts. A contract was to be signed by each of you during this week. You had to be naked around three o'clock in the morning. You had to wear a collar and leash and you had to wear a leash. If you could wear it all week while here in the house, you would each be permitted to wear this contract but there was no charge for this week either.</p> <p>The clause in the contract required you to follow an official contract and that contract was also signed by each person.</p> <p>You had to be naked on the same floor as we are.</p> <p>The first part I read was, "Sign your contract and then follow the same pattern as we follow the contract. You are allowed two orgasms while in the house before we leave." I signed my note and thenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
