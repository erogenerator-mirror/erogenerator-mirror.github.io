"What time is it?"</p> <p>"I'll get here soon!" I said. She looked at my face. "I'm not sure I could wait."</p> <p>"Me either!" she said. "But just... I'm not sure I'd be happy. I'd have to come back every weekend and do this for fun and games." I smiled.</p> <p>"Well, I guess you could just... uh... if you really, really want me to. I wouldn't want to hurt your feelings." She looked up at me with a smirk.</p> <p>"You've already hurt them, though..." I said with a grin before I broke into a bigger grin.</p> <p>Before she could respond, I had been up to her bedroom and was standing in front of it, looking at my phone.</p> <p>"You really should," I said as I took it off. She looked at it, then at my face.</p> <p>"What?" she said. I looked at her like I was going to ask something stupid, but then shook my head no.</p> <p>"Well, I'm thinking," I said as I sat down on the bed, "that maybe you're not even ready to do this."</p> <p>"Well, I'm not sure I'm ready..."</p> <p>"So..." I said. Her face turned toward me then she leaned to face me. I turned to her as I leaned to her, our lips coming together. Instinctively, we made our way closer until our noses touched. We made a soft, timid smile. I leaned in to kiss her, but quickly put my tongue to the back of her mouth. We made out while she slowly undid my pants and pulled them off. I felt her hands in my boxer-briefs as she fumbled with my belt and opened my robe.</p> <p>As we kissed, we found each other's room. While we were kissing, she managed to lift my undershirt out of the way, then grabbed my boxer-briefs and yanked them down over my hips, along with my shorts. She stood up then, and I lifted her up into my arms and carried her up the hallway to her room.</p> <p>"Wait!" I said as I kicked open her door. "I don't have a key."</p> <p>As she laughed, I picked her up and threw her on the bed. She giggled as I carried her over to the bed. She lay there, her head resting on a pillow, her arms spread out at the sides. I kicked my shoes off, and then undid my belt as I walked toward the bed and laid her back.</p> <p>"I'm not sure I can..." she started</p> <p>"Don't you worry about me," I said.</p> <p>I slid her blouse over her head, and undid her bra, revealing her beautiful B cups. I took a nipple into my mouth, and sucked it lovingly. I began to kiss my way down her stomach, past her bellybutton, then to the outside of her panties. As I worked my way down her thighs I started to unbutton her jeans.</p> <p>"Just get them off," she said.</p> <p>I quickly and deftly unzipped her jeans and slid them down. They landed on the floor around her ankles, leaving just a pair of blue cotton panties on. She lay on the bed, panting slightly.</p> <p>"I thought you could get dressed," I said as I ran my hands lightly over her.</p> <p>Lying there, I began to slide my hands down over her back, then up her sides, to her hips, to her stomach. I began to trace my fingers lightly around her panties, then slowly slid them down, revealing her beautiful round ass. She pushed her ass up toward me, and I pushed my hand forward, gently touching the lips of her pussy. We both giggled.</p> <p>I moved my head lower... slowly. I kissed her thighs in front of her as I slid her panties down. As they came off her feet and she kicked her shoes off, I kissed on the inside of them.</p> <p>"Oh, God!" she sighed. She arched her back slightly as I ran my tongue lightly between her pussy lips.</p> <p>"I'm going to start with some kisses," I said, and moved my mouth to her belly button. I kissed that area as my fingers lightly traced circles around her pussy lips. My lips were on her clit and I could feel the soft bumps as I brushed my lips at first.</p> <p>"Oh! Oh! Fuck!" she said and sighed as I ran the flat of my tongue up and down, over her clit.</p> <p>Then I ran my wet lips down the center of her pussy and around her hole, and as I did, I slipped my middle finger inside her. She let out a soft, quiet, "Ohâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
