I continued.</p> <p>"Just watch," she said, "and when you're ready, you can do whatever you want with her. And that is if you'll give me a chance to, um, you know, make it a fantasy for her." She smiled wickedly and I knew she was having the same idea.</p> <p>"That I will take very seriously," I stated.</p> <p>"Well, I'll see you in class," she said.</p> <p>I walked out of the office with a grin on my face. I was glad someone had a sense of humor, my heart was racing and it was a short walk to class. I didn't want to lose any of the excitement of my encounter, but to say I was excited excited. I headed to my classroom and sat down in front of it. My mind was spinning and I thought about what I could be doing that would get her to really respond.</p> <p>When class was out, I rushed through a few classes, but my mind would wander to Beth again and if it did, if she would really agree. I still wasn't sure what to think about her, but the thought was still there. I really didn't expect to ever see her again and I knew this was what I wanted.</p> <p>In addition to doing the things I had dreamed about with Beth on a few occasions in the last few months we were both married with children and just loved the company of each other. We had become good friends and were very close when we were in college, but nothing quite like this came between us. We were both committed to being faithful to each other, but neither of us was about to give up our marriage completely.</p> <p>Before class, I was sitting next to each other when Beth walked into her room and was wearing a white blouse and a pair of pink and black skinny jeans. Beth wasn't wearing a bra and her tits were firm and jiggled with each step she took. I was mesmerized watching them move and felt an instant erection in my pants.</p> <p>As she came into the room, she stopped dead in her tracks and stared at me. "You still want me?" She asked.</p> <p>I looked her and said, "What are you doing here?"</p> <p>"Because you know exactly what I'm doing and you want to see me." She explained to me. I just sat motionless in my seat looking at her.</p> <p>She went on, "I thought I would walk in and see you and see what I was looking at."</p> <p>"Oh, I didn't know you were into my panties, but thank you for giving me a chance," I answered. I felt as though she was walking on a treadmill and at that moment, my body tingled. She looked me straight in the eyes, "Thank you for not letting my panties know you were looking."</p> <p>Without even looking up, I replied, "I'm glad you enjoyed it."</p> <p>"And, if it makes you feel better, no more panties need be worn," she said.</p> <p>"Oh, that sounds so good," I replied.</p> <p>I just sat there like the idiot I was getting myself into. I knew she was still married and had nothing against her. I just didn't have the guts to do it. She must be the one taking the lead on getting me to do this.</p> <p>Beth asked, "What kind of panties do they have?" When I had gotten up to leave, I had to sit down and I felt my dick start to get hard. I looked at her and she was staring straight into my eyes. I told her I was married and I had never done it before and she said, "Of course not. No time like the present to experiment?" I told her I'd be back shortly. She then closed her door and I was left alone in the classroom.</p> <p>After about another 45 minutes of non-stop conversation, I closed my notebook and sat down with more thoughts running through my head. I still couldn't think clearly because of the arousal I had just been feeling. "So," I finally muttered out, "if this is the last time I see Beth and if you're going to do this, how can I not feel uncomfortable?"</p> <p>When I wasn't looking, I was looking at her face. She was still looking intently at me and when I looked up, her face was only inches from my own. I was mesmerized by the desire that ran through all three of us. We looked into each others eyes for a few seconds and I could feel my pulse racing. Neither of us had to say anything and I knew exactly what I needed to do.</p> <p>I took her hand and movedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
