Uuugggghhhhhhh!"</p> <p>Her own pussy clamped the other side of Bob's cock. My friend's body tensed. Her body shook with pleasure. Bob's hands pulled her up and into an upright position, holding her back, as he plunged deeply into her as he came.</p> <p>As their orgasms subsided, Bob lifted her off his cock. She lay down on the sofa, gasping in a breath as she did, her legs slightly apart from him. Her head hung down in a daze. My girlfriend looked so sexy.</p> <p>Looking at my friends naked, we all knew we would have a great time with her. She had just started to come around.</p> <p>She had to sit up again and look back at us, as we each slowly removed our clothes. Bob dropped his pants and we both stood naked in front of her.</p> <p>Catching my eye, she looked over at us.</p> <p>"I want us to be naked." I said.</p> <p>My friends nodded and took off their clothes. We couldn't help but notice that their cocks were pointing up in the air as they moved toward her. I wasn't sure that the feeling of our hot naked bodies together was mutual.</p> <p>Backing up against me, Bob said "You have to try these. Now."</p> <p>His body was firm and muscular and his dick was big -- very hard and long. I looked at the head of his member, just barely touching my hand. I grabbed it and moved my hand up and down. He was already leaking. I held it up, and moved it back to my hand. It was thick, and his precum oozed from it. My cock stood straight up from it.</p> <p>Beside us, my girlfriend had turned toward Bob and said "Kiss me."</p> <p>The look in her eyes was lust. She smiled and extended her tongue. Our eyes met and I looked into hers.</p> <p>They kissed briefly, then she said "Oh, God, I've wanted you so badly!"</p> <p>The excitement in my own eyes at her words was also heightened. I moved into the embrace. My friend grabbed my cock, and put it in her mouth.</p> <p>It wasn't hard, but it was nice. I was surprised, as she had never done anything like this before. She licked and sucked my shaft as I had done to hers. I moved my hands over her chest, and squeezed her tits. She put her hands over mine and guided them over the sides of her breasts.</p> <p>My cock was starting to lose stiffness as I was touching her. My friend moved over, and straddled Bob's thigh. He pulled her hips to his own, and started to kiss her breasts.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" she asked.</p> <p>"Just a kiss." I whispered, as I moved my hips against hers.</p> <p>She responded. I moved one hand up his leg, and began to rub his cock up and down. I looked over to see that my boyfriend had his cock in her other hand. Watching her and Bob kiss, and rubbing his cock and cock together, brought me to my second hard-on, a fact that I'd missed so long.</p> <p>As I began to stroke the inside of Bob's thigh, he stopped kissing her and said "Kiss me."</p> <p>I put my hands on her hips and slowly guided myself toward her. We parted our mouths.</p> <p>His lips were soft and warm and moist and inviting. I found myself wanting him. His lips seemed to be demanding entry. My heart was pounding in my chest as I put my hands around the back of her head and put my cock into her mouth. It was much softer than hers, and very warm and moist, as she pulled me down toward her lips. We kissed, and then sucked each others tongue, as she took his cock back into her mouth.</p> <p>I moved my other hand around to her back, and rubbed it as I moved my hips. I moved my dick into her. I was very wet, and her pussy was tighter than mine. I moved my hips back and forth, with each forward motion feeling her clench her muscles around me. I was amazed at the sensations of our lips pressed against each other. She was so sweet, and there was nothing else that I wanted more right now. As my hands explored her back and neck, she started sucking on me more eagerly. I moved my hips further up, feeling her clench around me more deeply. We began to go faster, and she moaned a deeper moan when he kissed the place where our tongues had joined.</p> <p>I pulled back slightly, and moved my head to the side so that I could see his cock moving between her breasts.
