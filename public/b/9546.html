I yelped and pushed back against him as he began to explore me with his tongue. I felt the tip of his tongue poke into my hole as his finger circled around my bud. I squealed as he pulled it out and thrust it back in. I arched my back as he flicked my clit in and out with his finger, and a moment later I was coming again, screaming and tossing about. He pulled his finger out of my ass, and my pussy began to pulsate over everything he had.</p> <p>"Good girl…that was very good." he said as he rubbed my body with his hand. He smiled, and kissed me gently as I came down from the high, and kissed his ear.</p> <p>"Are you ready to take my cock?" he asked.</p> <p>I nodded, and he pulled away from me.</p> <p>"Strip and stand up." he commanded as he stepped towards me. I stood still as he took the ropes from the nightstand and tied my ankles to the bed. Again he repeated the process, this time taking the other ankle, and looping it through the headboard so I was now secured to the bed. He tied my other ankle, and the rest of my body to the bed too.</p> <p>He stood a moment before he undressed. I couldn't see, or care – he'd been doing this to me for a month, I guess. He climbed in the bed, and lay beside me.</p> <p>"You were ready for me yesterday didn't you?" he asked. He began caressing my breast, and began kissing me again.</p> <p>"Yes. I wasn't ready just yet. What took you so long?" he asked. I couldn't believe how good he felt as he slid his hands over me and massaged my clit, before pulling away from kissing me. He teased my tits, my stomach, my thighs… and eventually I finally gave in to his kisses. He teased my pussy as my fingers danced over my body.</p> <p>He made my body writhe and buck as his fingers teased my clit, my back, my stomach… and finally my nipples. He pressed into me as he squeezed my breasts, and I loved it. My eyes were closed. His mouth covered mine again, and I felt his tongue probe into my mouth. I licked his lips. He pulled away.</p> <p>"Tell me how much you want to cum, slave. I knew that you craved it, and that you needed this. I want to hear you beg and plead for release. Do it. Cum for me." His voice was harsh in my ear, "Show me how much you needed this."</p> <p>I bit my lip, and my nails began to trail through his chest again as my fingers dug their way into the thin fabric of his shirt. He lifted his chest slightly off the bed and pulled it up over his head, freeing my hands. I was still in my bra.</p> <p>"Please don't be so rough. Make me do so. You don't have the patience to take it from me…you don't have the patience to take this from me." he whispered, running his fingers into my hair. Before I knew it, I felt him push his dick down my slit, and felt it begin to stretch me out. I pushed back into his hardness.</p> <p>"Oh, yes…you're so tight," he hissed in my ear. I felt his fingers tighten on my nipples, and he pulled them away from my body. He pinched my clit then, tugged on them before pulling them away. I felt a burning sensation burn down from my belly to my aching pussy. "Do you want it harder?" he asked, and I nodded. His fingers curled up and began to slide in and out. He pulled down on the chain as he fucked me, and with a twist, I felt the chain fall to the floor.</p> <p>"Harder, baby. Scream into my open mouth. Scream for your master." I screamed out as my body rocked from the intensity of what he was doing to me. "Don't move! Fuck me! Please, I need you, I need you to fuck me!" I was screaming at all these words, and he wasn't even stroking. He was not stopping.</p> <p>"Do it! Please, master." I moaned, as my body began to shake uncontrollably, and I was moaning continuously as he took me to the edge of orgasm again. I felt his fingers slide down to my ass, and began to probe. I could feel the tips of his fingers as he rubbed over my entrance. He began pushing them in and out as he continued to pleasure me. The sensation was incredible, but I knew I had to have more. I raised my body off—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
