As I had anticipated, she had a small mole on left cheek. I continued to tease her, leaning over slightly, moving the edge of her bikini top until she raised her arms and let the material fall at her waist. Still teasingly, I could feel her smile as she arched her spine, and lifted her small hand. My eyes were riveted on her cleavage, and I could see her nipples puckered and erect through her swimsuit.</p> <p>I pulled her to me, gently but firmly, as I took a large handful of her hair and, turning the back of her head to me, I placed my mouth on hers to kiss her deeply. She responded willingly, pushing her hot mound into my thigh, letting her breasts, covered in soft, silky satin lingerie move slightly against my leg, and my cock began to redden uncontrollably. My lips left hers and moved down to brush the tip of her tongue over it. Her tongue slid over it, gently. At the contact, I looked down to see an unmistakable bulge. Her face was flushed with excitement, and her eyes were closed. I smiled as I took her hand and moved it to my cock. She squeezed it lightly, giving it a slight squeeze and a gentle rub through my shorts as she continued to rub her tongue against the head as our tongues continued their passionate kissing. I reached down and slid my hand into the leg hole of her swimsuit, and under it to rub the palm of my hand over her protruding stomach and then up the underside to rub her soft tits through her swimsuit. Her breath became ragged and her nipples began pushing harder against the fabric and my hand. After a while of teasing her, I moved my hand back down to her breasts and pulled the string in between them, causing the sides of her swimsuit to separate and expose her areola to my fingers. She spread her legs slightly, allowing me complete access to her. We continued kissing, both of us breathing heavily, our eyes closed, enjoying the sensations that were going on between our legs. Finally, she pulled away, breathless and flushed. We stood looking at each other for a moment, smiling. I stepped away and we embraced, sharing a soft, wet kiss.</p> <p>"That was wonderful, Tom," she said.</p> <p>"It sure was, " I replied.</p> <p>We held each other for a moment. I held onto her and she squeezed me tight, almost crushing our chests together. We pulled apart with our arms and kissed tenderly, letting our lust and excitement get the better of us. We smiled at each other and continued to caress each other. My cock was pressed against her thigh and her bikini bottom was pulled back slightly as I held her. She broke the embrace and pulled me down the hall to her bedroom, where we continued to touch each other as we undressed each other with our eyes.</p> <p>We sat on the bed as she turned off the lamp in her room and I knelt, kneeling on the floor. I pulled her closer to me as she reached behind her to take off her suit. Together we began to unbutton and remove her top, freeing her breasts and stomach. We continued to do this for a few moments until her arms gave way and she had just removed her bikini bottom. She spread her legs and allowed my head between them. I reached down and placed my hands on her thighs. My thumbs caressed her outer folds, my fingers running along her soft sides as I gently lowered my head into her pussy. I closed my lips around her clit, then licked her to a standing erection and finally to the hilt of her lips.</p> <p>"Oh, god," she moaned as she felt my tongue slide up and down her opening, taking her clit between my lips as I suckled it. Her hands were on my head at the same time. She held me to her while she began to writhe beneath me. I took advantage of that by plunging two fingers into her as my tongue continued to stimulate her clit. She moaned softly, and began to rise in her rocking motion. I sensed she was on the verge of coming, and began to feel the tremors run through her thighs, to the point of pain. I sensed she was close. She pulled my head to her and brought my lips to her breast as she came, and I continued to suck her clit as her trembling got stronger. She came to a complete stop as she stopped moving. The tremors subsided and I looked up at her, her eyes staring into mine. I looked down to see that her tits were still exposed, her nipples hard and erect, her chest heaving. She was breathing heavily as I slowly raised myself. As I reached out my hands to rub over her naked body, she reached out her arms and pulled me with her.</p> <p>"Don't stop here, Tom." she whisperedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
