The sun is going down on us."</p> <p>"And what of Mr. G?" I continued to talk to her.</p> <p>She shrugged her shoulder but looked at me, her eyes pleading.</p> <p>"Mr. G is going to take care of me - you get up on this ledge and put your hand on my leg. Then you lay down on her lap."</p> <p>The mention of Mrs. G's name stirred her, making her legs twinge. I turned the hot tub back on to a warmer setting and helped her up her legs and arms before placing them back down on the ledge.</p> <p>"I'm wet, Mrs. G," I said. "It would be too cold to sit in here."</p> <p>"Thank you." There was a feeling of warmth.</p> <p>A couple of minutes of talking on the glass surface in front of the window, and then we heard Mrs. G say "Gretchen, do I have to leave your panties on? Mr. G is going to like it."</p> <p>She looked up and was disappointed. "Oh, I should stay."</p> <p>"Oh, no," said Mrs. G. "He's not going to be able to take care of you, I don't want him to take care of you. He'll be too excited. I need to know what to do."</p> <p>"Don't I get a say in this?" She asked.</p> <p>"Of course," I said. "It feels quite natural. It is a privilege to be the man of the house," I said. "It's just a part of the house."</p> <p>"I don't mind doing it - I love my husband. I didn't think I could do it, that was all." Mrs. G sounded sad, the sound of her voice sounding distant and far away.</p> <p>"It's OK," I said. "It's not a chore. I'll keep your knickers on."</p> <p>I put some of the lemonade on the ledge to warm it up and knelt back in the open to let her lay back on the ledge on her stomach. At first she didn't lift her bottom up or stretch her legs out to the side so I went back to the window.</p> <p>"I'll take care of them. They do look warm - and it feels good to warm yourself. Do whatever you like and I'll leave them over your head."</p> <p>I laid the glass on the ledge and watched and listened. I felt a sudden warmth, as if she were a hot steam. It wasn't long before the heat from my body grew and my legs began to get warm.</p> <p>"You have a nice body there," said Mrs. G. "Nice and young," she added. "Why do you get it?"</p> <p>"It helps me get into things," I responded. "It's really quite a boost when you are on a ladder."</p> <p>"It sure helps," she said.</p> <p>"Thank you - it means a lot."</p> <p>She lifted herself until she could look at my crotch. She was breathing a little faster and her eyes were staring at me. I watched her, unable to look away. Mrs. G had an idea, and she turned her head, putting the glasses in my hand and leaned back on her elbow. Her arm rose up, and her fingers began to play with my nipple. I tried not to make a noise, not wanting to make a scene, even if we had already finished our glass of lemonade. That would have been silly.</p> <p>"Just lie down and I'll make the next move," Mrs. G said.</p> <p>She grabbed my cock, and began stroking it. "Your penis is very big and thick - you'd love for me to suck it, wouldn't you?" I nodded while I tried to catch my breath.</p> <p>"I don't have any lube, is that OK?"</p> <p>"Well, of course."</p> <p>"I just can't get your cock that big."</p> <p>I shook my head. Even as I'd already found out - it only took a bit of lube, and the skin just brushed over the outside to rub around. After a while she had me at the edge of my skin, then slipped me out, still stroking me.</p> <p>"It's very warm now," she said, "my legs are a bit wobbly."</p> <p>"You're doing a good job on my penis," I said. "It's getting bigger,"</p> <p>"My husband's penis is just getting bigger."</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yes," I said. "He always does something like this to me, I think."</p> <p>"Like what?"</p> <p>"I can't answer - I don't know."</p> <p>"I do know," said Mrsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
