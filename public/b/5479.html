I can't describe her as perfect. She looks like Angelina Jolie,"</p> <p>"She did?"</p> <p>"Yeah, she said so, and she's got a really hot body."</p> <p>"Oh my god! I can't believe it—she's a porn star."</p> <p>"It's really true. She got a nice body, it's true, but I bet she's got a few big boobs and they're a real handful."</p> <p>"That's amazing. She was lucky she didn't get implants—"</p> <p>"She's the one who said there were no limits to what she's able to do."</p> <p>"Well, I don't know if she's on the pill or not."</p> <p>"You think?"</p> <p>I was really surprised by her revelation.</p> <p>"Yeah, that's it...she said it's all right if I feel like I'm pregnant and I don't want it to look like I'm out of control—I mean, don't we have the right place?"</p> <p>She nodded her head and looked me in the eyes.</p> <p>"It's true. We both want to feel what it's like, but I guess I'd probably have to wait."</p> <p>"Well, if you really need to feel it, then that's fine by me. It's just—well, it's just so wonderful. If I just cum that way, it's like, it's wonderful even if I don't feel it—that's really erotic, isn't it?"</p> <p>And then I was on my knees in front of her, naked, and I started sucking. She was on her back in only her towel, so it was very easy to take all of her tits in, each of them in front of me, and suck her nipples. She let me work for a bit, but quickly pulled herself away from me. We made out a while on the towel and I could taste my cum on her mouth. It made her shiver again, so I could almost taste it.</p> <p>We were standing at the edge of my bed, with our towels wrapped around us, when she finally said: "If you really want to go down on this—if you really need to feel it—then you'll only have to wait. I just need it right now."</p> <p>I smiled, and kissed her. Her mouth was surprisingly hot, and that brought on another session of our mutual licking, sucking, kissing. I finally pulled away, and she rolled on her side, facing me. She moved her leg between mine and we ended our kiss, still just below the surface of the water.</p> <p>"My God, I just fucked the hottest girl in the world. Thank you. Thank you so much."</p> <p>She pushed her hand inside the top of my towel, which was just over my erection, and she stroked me a bit more than she would have done if we just lay there together, just kissing. She looked at me and said,</p> <p>"Is this what you had in mind?"</p> <p>I raised up on my elbows, and we looked at each other.</p> <p>"I'd like to make love to you, like I do in this movie—with you."</p> <p>"You have a lovely voice, and your breasts are amazing, as much as they look—my goodness, they're really big!"</p> <p>"Okay, I will. If a guy's cock comes out, let me know and we'll have a deal."</p> <p>"I can do that, too, and if I really want to, you won't be disappointed."</p> <p>"And you'll get a taste of Angelina's pussy right there in the dark."</p> <p>She laughed.</p> <p>"I don't think I'll be disappointed."</p> <p>We fell asleep and I woke up an hour or so later. I felt a little disoriented, I couldn't put a finger on it; the room was a little foggy, but when I realized where I was, it was still early in the morning.</p> <p>It was around ten a.m. I found a note on the dresser and handed it to her:</p> <p>"Do you ever go to bed naked?"</p> <p>"Sure, I'm good at it."</p> <p>"I would like to feel that."</p> <p>"I'd like to too, and that will be very welcome."</p> <p>"I'll hold you to it. And, don't think I won't hold you to it—let me know in the morning when your husband is in bed and you can give me more, if you're up for it."</p> <p>She wrote that one down, and handed me a little piece of paper.
