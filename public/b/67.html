"I'm so horny I could do with a good massage," she replied in a soft tone.</p> <p>Mistress was looking up at me over the top of her glasses as she said this. I was amazed and flattered. My heart was going hammer-to beat in my chest as my submissive purred softly into my ear.</p> <p>"Mmmmm, I'm glad you enjoyed your massage," I said with a grin as I turned towards the shower and helped her to her feet as well.</p> <p>"Please let me get this massage warmed up, sir," she said, with a shy smile. "It feels soooooooooo good to have a nice masseur."</p> <p>"Your hands are so soft and delicate you know how to use them all the right ways, pet," I said as I helped her wash her body. "I think your body is much better than your head, Mistress," I told her as I turned her back to me.</p> <p>She slid her hands down and started to gently rub my erection through my pants as she worked for my collarbones. I moaned at her touch. She giggled, and gave it another soft stroke. She worked her hands down to my cock, giving it a gentle tug, then releasing it.</p> <p>"Mmmm, sir, if you're as good with your hands as they seem to be with that whip in the corner of your room that dungeon, I wonder if you could use a whip?" she told me.</p> <p>"It's a little more than that," I answered her. "But there's no need to worry about a whipping, pet, because I'll be very angry if you try and let me catch a break," I told her as she gently stroked my shaft.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she mumbled. "I'm so turned on by the idea of being whipped like that. I really want it," she added, as she leaned forward, giving me a sensuous kiss on the lips.</p> <p>"Would you let me see what a whip is like that is more appropriate?" I asked her as I handed her my stiff leather strap, and the barbells.</p> <p>"Yes, sir, I could let you whip me," she replied, as she bent down to kiss the barbells one at a time.</p> <p>"May I see," I asked her as I handed her my whip.</p> <p>"Yes, it's better with a real whip than a plastic ruler," she replied as she turned back towards me with her head lowered down.</p> <p>She spread her legs open and wrapped her hands around the edge of the desk as I knelt with my legs spread and my cock throbbing so hard I thought I was going to rip through my pants.</p> <p>I got up, walked over to a mirror on the wall of the shower and turned the handle to start the water. I walked back into the main bathroom and turned on the shower and stepped under the spray then the shower, and then I adjusted my erection.</p> <p>"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh, I could do something like this all day with a whip, sir," she moaned as I moved to the shower and turned the shower on.</p> <p>My eyes were glued to the shape of her swollen cunt lips, which were so wet they were glistening in the mirror. She stepped into the shower, wrapped her arms around my neck, kissed my mouth with a passion I had never been known for. We kissed with passion, lust, and urgency. I pushed her back, stood in front of her and looked into her eyes as I ran my lips down her cleft, over her clit, and then down to lick it very lightly. She put her hands on my head and pushed my face down hard into her swollen pussy lips.</p> <p>I started flicking the whip in my hand, flicking the tip between her lips. Then she got hold of my hair and pulled at it, pulling on the top of my head to keep it in place. She lifted her leg so the tip of my nose got closer to her clit as she let her other leg go down and pull it up toward her chest. Her hand kept sliding over me as she pressed my head against her as she climaxed. It seemed like an eternity before she pushed my face away, turned around, and kissed my lips with an urgency.</p> <p>"Please, sir, may I please come down," she said, still breathless.</p> <p>"Of course you may, pet," I replied as I turned the shower off.</p> <p>We got into a sixty-nine, with us facing each other with our faces in each other's thighs. We both enjoyed the pleasure of licking each other's pussies, which made our orgasms great. It was the kind that a couple can go on forever. It was wonderful to feel my Mistress lickingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
