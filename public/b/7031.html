"I want you to look at the window and see if they are any different. You want to know how much I love you."</p> <p>I opened my eyes and saw her face and I felt the heat from her.</p> <p>"Kiss me."</p> <p>I did.</p> <p>My other hand caressed her hair. She opened her mouth and I gently sucked it before bringing it to mine. Her tongue sought mine. "I love you, too."</p> <p>I loved seeing her in her naked state without trying to cover her. And I couldn't help smiling as I did.</p> <p>"I can't even describe how happy I am to see you here with me."</p> <p>"Can you ever see or feel you again?"</p> <p>I thought a few moments and then added "can I kiss you again?"</p> <p>"It takes a while and sometimes it takes a lot of effort."</p> <p>"But I think we would look good together."</p> <p>She smiled at the thought. "That is something I don't really have right now. I am so excited I can barely sit still. I want to kiss you all night long."</p> <p>"Do me a huge favor."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"I want to show you how much I love you."</p> <p>"You sure don't want to get a date with me?"</p> <p>"I want to go somewhere and have my hands all over you." And she was right.</p> <p>We kissed a lot that night. I couldn't get enough. My hands roamed over her. She felt so good. We ended up on her bed, kissing again. She reached down and stroked my rapidly hardening cock. She had the thought in mind to lick her own wetness off. My hand on her breast played with the nipple, rubbing it and pinching it. I turned her on her back, pushing her legs apart. I kissed along her legs and moved up toward her pussy. I was so wet it was almost painful. I ran my tongue along her outer lips. Slowly I spread her lips and touched her clitoris. I slowly teased her. Then I went down to my target. She began to buck against my face. She had started to buck and when she did I knew she was really close. I began to suck harder on her clit.</p> <p>"Oh! Don't stop. Oh! Oh! Oh! Ohhhhhh. My! Ahhhhhhhh!"</p> <p>She bucked as if she was in a daze and her legs locked around my head. She was shaking so hard I thought she might actually fall. I kept going until she came again and it was a powerful orgasm.</p> <p>Not too long afterward. Not too much longer.</p> <p>"Are you still hard?"</p> <p>"Yesssss!"</p> <p>"Can I turn over?"</p> <p>"How do you want it?"</p> <p>"On your back."</p> <p>I turned on my back and she straddled me. She stroked my hardness while she lowered herself onto it. I could tell she was wet but she didn't slide all the way down. I didn't move for quite some time. My hard cock pressed against the back of her abdomen. In a half minute or so she was all the way down on me. She held herself still while we kissed and she came and came and came. I held her with my cock still hard. As her hips started to rise and fall her pussy squeezed me. She was really hot. I knew I wouldn't last long.</p> <p>"Baby, I'm going to cum soon. We'd better speed right up or you'll start to get uncomfortable."</p> <p>"I'm ready."</p> <p>She moved more quickly on me. After about a minute I was ready to cum and she slowed again to just letting me get off.</p> <p>It didn't take us long. We came together and we lay there for a good minute. I told her about what we had just done. "Are you happy that you shared me with someone you didn't know?"</p> <p>"Yes. Very. And yes, I am happy too. Why do you think I didn't know how to tell anyone? I really didn't know how to tell you and I was never supposed to let anyone know."</p> <p>"Are you sure I didn't tell anyone about how we did?"</p> <p>"No, sweetheart."</p> <p>"I'm not worried about it, because you were my first."</p> <p>After her third climax, she moved off me and into the bathrobe and we showered and got dressed and then went out into the kitchen and had dinner and talked and had a few drinks and then got a cigarette and we were back home.
