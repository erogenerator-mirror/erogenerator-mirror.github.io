She had a playful smirk. "He says he doesn't mind but you're really too heavy for me. I know I'm going to have to change."</p> <p>I was glad of the opportunity to tell her so but it just so happened to be one in a million. "I like having you here." I added to that with a devilish grin.</p> <p>"You're funny," she said, and that sent a shiver up and down my spine.</p> <p>"You're really really nice, and so is you." I wasn't sure what she meant when she said we were "making love." I thought it was time to start looking to a new beginning. The next day she walked over to my workstation a few minutes later. "Are you coming in for work?" I was already up and walking when she got me on my feet.</p> <p>"Yeah, I have a meeting," I said as she walked me to the door.</p> <p>"No you don't, you know the meeting. There's no meeting today."</p> <p>"Yeah, well, I'm going to be late."</p> <p>"I know, but you have to," she said as she locked the door and got in my truck. It was early to work so we drove to the city park where we both enjoyed a little privacy when it was just one car in the park. She drove me over the shoulder to a park bench about halfway between an employee lot and one of the office gates.</p> <p>"So let's talk," I said. "What do we talk about?"</p> <p>"You want to work with me on this project?" She put her head down on the bench.</p> <p>"Well, yeah, but it's still not really a project."</p> <p>She looked at my face. "Why are you so interested in getting in to make me mad?" She was in her sixties and her face had changed some. She stared hard at me as she spoke. "I'm a teacher!" she cried at some point. "Why couldn't I see myself changing back?"</p> <p>"I'm sorry, but that's not the point, is it?"</p> <p>"I don't mean you."</p> <p>"No, but I'll change that if you change me." She looked at me. "Please be honest with me."</p> <p>"I'm not sure I should be the one doing this with a man," I said. "For one, he's not like you."</p> <p>"I know, I got caught up in the moment too quick."</p> <p>"Well, I'm so in love with you." My mouth fell open and then dropped. "You really love my cock?"</p> <p>"God yes," she said. "I wanted to do this with you for years, and that guy you were working with, well, his name was Jim and it was so easy." It took me a moment to comprehend her words. "Well, it wasn't easy. He didn't want to take me for granted but he was pretty arrogant. He called me all kinds of names. That was what he wanted. I told him I loved to fuck and told him, even though it was really degrading, in front of you."</p> <p>"That was it?" I was stunned at the turn of events. She was telling me that I would have had to fuck Jim's boss if she was going to work with him and now she wasn't going to come right out and say so. "Why didn't you just tell me?"</p> <p>"Because there's no such thing as a 'good boy' in the workplace now," she said. "And Jim was too weak to be allowed to come in here. He wanted me to give him what he wanted. I told no. I kept saying no, but it never worked." she went on, "He told me he didn't understand, so I ended up fucking him." She took a deep breath.</p> <p>"You've got to be kidding?"</p> <p>"No, and if he really liked it then he wouldn't come out."</p> <p>We drove for several more blocks. I had been driving since we started and had come to a stop in the front of the city park. We got out and I took her back to the train station and waited inside. We got off work at the station. She didn't go back into work.</p> <p>"There are going to be a lot more people in town than there are people in the office over here."</p> <p>She laughed. "I know it's going to be busy but some of the men on the board of a freight building are going to be out here tonight. We'll have them inside shortly.
