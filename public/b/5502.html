"I just wanted to do something really important to you." He tried to smile but couldn't help feeling a little silly. "I want you to fuck me. I want to give you everything that's in our marriage and I'm your willing sub, for you."</p> <p>"Are you sure you want it that well?"</p> <p>In answer, she reached down and slowly pulled off her panties, letting them pool by her ankles on the sofa, then stood and sat down, her legs spread and waiting. She leaned back comfortably with her legs wide and pulled her arms behind her, her head back and her chin on her forearms, offering her breasts to him as her hand found its own way to her wet and puffed-up pussy and she began to toy with herself, her hips moving back and forth like a fish with her fingers. "Ooooh, that's nice," she cooed as she began to slide a finger slowly into herself. "Fuck me," she told him before she pulled away, "fuck with my cock!" She had never had sex with her husband, and as she did so he looked at her as she lay there. He knew he liked her, but had no doubt that she would never be able to do what she had said, nor do what she had asked, and he wanted to know if it would be alright.</p> <p>He took her by the hand and slowly stood, taking her with him as he went, making his way toward her bedroom. Once they were safely between their respective doors, he walked to her. "You're so fucking sexy," he said as he put his hands on her shoulders and led her toward the bed. She looked at him for a moment and took a deep breath before turning to face him.</p> <p>He kissed her, first on the lips, then her forehead and finally her eyes, before beginning to unbutton her blouse. As he reached her waist, he felt more than saw her hands reach behind him, her body responding with its own sensations as she pulled his shirt from his jeans and pulled his arms towards her. She ran her hands over his back, feeling his broad shoulders and the muscles in them. He lifted her onto the bed, leaving her still straddled on his lap, her breasts still exposed. She reached behind her back for the button to his jeans, unzipped them and reached inside, freeing his erection as it stood proudly upright under its self-abuse.</p> <p>He dropped her off his lap, her legs still on the bed and, standing, faced away from her, pulled his pants off, his cock brushing against her buttocks as he did so. He helped her roll over onto her back and slid his trousers from around his ankles, throwing them away with a flourish over her body, revealing to her what he wanted to do next. She lifted her knees, her legs spread and beckoning him to her.</p> <p>He slid forward on the bed and slid her legs apart, his face hovering above her where the soft hair that covered her pussy spread slightly, his eyes fixed on her body. He saw her pussy lips, red and swollen, open and waiting, her clitty erect in the dim light, poking out from between her nether lips. He reached up to gently stroke the hairless skin between her pussy and ass as his tongue ran over her lips, licking them as he pushed one of his own to her. Finally he ran the flat of his tongue across her clitoris, the tip flicking over that little nub and sending her into spasms of pleasure. He worked himself with his tongue over her clitty until she was groaning, unable to stand it any longer and had to wrap her legs over his waist and pull him to her as he reached for his cock, pushing it into her eager pussy as he felt herself slowly begin to tighten around him. Just as easily, it felt like she was holding him inside her, as she was moving with him. She couldn't see him as he kissed her all over, even her nipples and his mouth were just as wonderful, if not better, than the last time she'd had him inside her.</p> <p>Then he pulled back, wanting to prolong the moment, and watched her as she lay there. Her face was flushed, her lips quivering, her eyes still looking at him as she looked at him. He began to ease himself out of her, moving only slightly as he went, just the tip of his cock still inside her, the swollen head parting the lips as he brought himself back to his knees. Once at her legs, he ran his hands up her legs, finding a warm and firm cushion and pulling her right foot across to his left knee and then the left, placing her foot on his shoulder. He lifted his head, his mouth kissing her with his hands on her waist. He pushed himself back in and he watched her face as heâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
