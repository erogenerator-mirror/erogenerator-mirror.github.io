I kissed her temple softly for a few moments and then I knelt down and kissed her face, her lips, her eyes, her nose, and finally her lips. She kissed me back enthusiastically. "You're a natural," she said. "I love knowing you are here."</p> <p>"You are too."</p> <p>"But my love is like the ocean," she continued, "and it's so nice to be at the end of it. I never really felt as alone with a man as I did with you now."</p> <p>"You are the ultimate love, but now you can truly explore all the things men and women can do together."</p> <p>"You're the best husband ever!" she giggled, then went on, "I mean that! I have never been able to thank a man enough for all that he did for me and he always wanted more and I know he did too. He would do anything to have me again and now I'm in bed with you and I'm happy."</p> <p>She laid her head on my chest and hugged herself, holding me tight and murmuring in my ear, "Yes. I do love you, and I want to make love to you again, anytime you want. I just hope I can come in to your arms for real."</p> <p>I held her up like that, her body pressed against me and she held me close and kissed my face and neck and chest, then reached down and cupped my balls in her hand and gently caressed them. "Yes, my love, let me do that," I said, "Please do that for me."</p> <p>"As you wish," she smiled. "Maybe later after this we're just in bed and you're going to enjoy me again. I think that's where we would like to stay."</p> <p>I kissed her lips and she turned onto her side and looked up at me with a smile on her face. I held her and stroked her face. I felt a rush just remembering the past six months and the pleasure that I felt at that moment. She held me tightly and said, "I'm going to go get up and we'll try to get some sleep. We don't have the same number of hours a week."</p> <p>She was gone and I knew she was in trouble. She took my hand and led me to the bathroom, where she stood up and faced me in the mirror. "Thank you so much for being so good to me," she said softly, then kissed me again. "I love you and I hope you're going to have a wonderful life and I'll try too, but I just don't know about getting you pregnant."</p> <p>"I'm doing my best to be more compatible," I told her, "but I just feel like I'm going to be an invalid all of the time."</p> <p>Sandy came back into the bathroom wearing her jeans and a t-shirt. She had put some lotion on her legs and had them glistening with her juices. She looked so happy and so much more beautiful than in her previous days that I thought I'd die just looking at her. She was smiling and looking at herself in the mirror. "You look great," she said at last. "Thank you." She reached in her purse and pulled out some hair ties and began untying them. I put my hands on her shoulders for balance and she stood up and then moved her hands to her sides. It took us at the same time. Then her hands started to unfasten the buttons on her shirt. I helped her and it was off. The sight of her naked and beautiful body, beautiful, sexy, desirable, and available made my cock hard. I took off my shirt and we stood there together, both topless. I felt Sandy reach down and take my cock in both hands, then she undid her bra and reached down to my belt. I unzipped my pants and began freeing my cock, which sprang back to life. Sandy leaned in and kissed me and then she pushed me back against the bathroom wall and bent over to open the shower door. I was behind her, my cock sliding into her, then she reached back and guided me into her.</p> <p>It was wonderful. I was able to hold still for several moments and I fucked her slowly, knowing that I was about to cum. When my orgasm began, I looked into the mirror and saw Sandy just staring with her arms wrapped around me as she kissed me. "God!" I yelled. "How are you going to get pregnant?" She just looked at me lovingly as her head came up and back in a smile.</p> <p>"I told you." She said, her voice soft but firm.
