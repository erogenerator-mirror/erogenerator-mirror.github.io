Thank you for everything. And I also need to say something that I think we'll both agree on. You know how I feel about your ex wife and your relationship. You probably hate her enough that you even love another's cock," I chuckled.</p> <p>I felt him nod his head before he responded. "Yeah I think we need to do that for her," he said. I could swear I saw his eyes move to make sure he was serious. My eyes also moved to check his eyes for a sign he approved of my idea. The look that went with that looked like it was going to be a lot easier on him than mine.</p> <p>"What do you want to talk about?" I asked, thinking about where this would go from here.</p> <p>"I really think that he might be a little jealous of our relationship. I have to admit that I think I'm jealous of his wife," he said. "But I think you might be ready to open up."</p> <p>"Maybe," I said, "and I do appreciate what you're willing to say. Let me try to explain it a little."</p> <p>"Yeah," he said, "it really sucks knowing that she is always trying to get your attention so that she can get off. It's not something I want to risk seeing her with another man."</p> <p>"I'm sorry about that, I guess," I said apologetically.</p> <p>"It's OK," he said, "if you really don't mind if she does it with someone else."</p> <p>"Well, she has a good body," I added, thinking about the look that had come over me earlier. "It makes me feel good to be so lucky to get you with her," I laughed.</p> <p>"Well," he said, "her ass is my favorite part of it," he smiled, before he added, "and she's always been pretty adventurous with it."</p> <p>"Well," I thought of the look I saw in his eyes before, "I agree with you."</p> <p>We moved closer to each other. I pressed my body against him and he smiled at me. "I know that I'll want to fuck you when we get out, " he said, "... if you keep going."</p> <p>"What," I asked with a smoldering smile on my face. "Are you jealous that I fucked your wife?"</p> <p>"Well, it's not like that," he said, "not really. We have our ways."</p> <p>"What you and I, I didn't fuck, then I didn't fuck," I said with a devilish grin on my face.</p> <p>I felt his hand move to the small of my back, "Do you know anything about that part of it?" he asked.</p> <p>"I don't," I said, trying to move closer to him even though my body was still against his.</p> <p>"Well, it's nothing for you to worry about," he said and moved his hands to my sides, "and it is hard to complain with my cock inside of you. There's nothing to be afraid of," he whispered in my ear.</p> <p>I closed my eyes as he kissed me again, this time more passionately. I felt as if I could breathe. My cock was hard and I had forgotten about it before I realized my state of undress. I felt his hands move down to my ass and squeezed.</p> <p>"You know," he continued, "I don't know if I'd tell anybody about the stuff you're on here with them," I felt embarrassed. He kissed me again and slid another one of his hands down my back to my tight ass. I felt his fingers touch my ass cheeks.</p> <p>"There's nothing wrong with you," my head began to nod as I thought about how we might be doing the kissing and groping that had just happened. I wondered if we could get the other to do the same thing we just had. He slid his hand up my back, across my shoulders until he reached the small of my back. Then he began to caress my back. He moved his hand down to my upper thighs, then back to my ass cheeks. I felt a rush of excitement as his hand ran across my warm skin. His fingers touched my naked ass cheek, and he squeezed my flesh. I felt me tense at his touch.</p> <p>"Are you okay with it?" he whispered, still kissing me and massaging my ass.</p> <p>I nodded my head in agreement. He took my hand and guided me to the bed as he kept kissing me. We fell onto the bed with me on top. We kept kissing. His tongue slipped inside my mouth. I felt his hands on the small of my back again. I could feel my cock as it jumped under the sheetsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
