She loved it when Bobby sucked on her clit and her little nubbin as he slid his tongue all the way inside her, and she loved when it was Bobby's cock that was doing the same to her.</p> <p>They had been together long enough for them to make love and get each other off twice, but that did not give her the same pleasure she was feeling when she was with him. The difference was that a cock was different and she felt that she was in her own little world compared to Bobby's.</p> <p>Mia could feel Bobby's cock begin to get hard again. She opened her legs wider and reached down between them to guide his shaft to her hole.</p> <p>"Let's switch places," she said.</p> <p>"I wish you could be on both sides again," Bobby said. "You look so sexy and so hot... and you can fuck me, can't you?"</p> <p>"Mmmm, I do," she said and moved her hips against him as her head lay on his left shoulder.</p> <p>Bobby watched her and couldn't resist slipping his fingers into her pussy. Mia moaned softly at the sensation, her hands grabbing the sheets of the bed as she lifted herself up an inch and then sank back down.</p> <p>Bobby could sense her getting closer to her own orgasm as she pressed her hips harder against him and squeezed his cock. He knew she was going to cum soon and so he lifted his head to look at her face.</p> <p>"I don't have time, Bobby. I have to go soon," she said.</p> <p>"That's okay," he said as he turned his head so that he could kiss her. "You can do this, baby."</p> <p>Bobby eased Mia back down onto his cock until her ass was against his stomach and he was buried inside her and it made her hips jerk against him. She reached down between them and found his shaft hard and ready for more. She guided his cock towards her pussy as the head slipped past her outer lips and into her hole.</p> <p>"Fuck, Mia," was all Bobby got before she grabbed his shaft and pulled it back toward her. "Oh my God! That feels so good!"</p> <p>Mia laughed and held onto his hips as Bobby began thrusting in and out; getting in her and loving every second. She had never felt anything so wonderful. Her hips began to move in time with Bobby's thrusting as he reached over to her pussy. His fingers found her clit and he began rubbing it and Mia began to moan louder.</p> <p>"Oh, Bobby! Right there! It's too good!" she moaned. "It's going to make me cum!"</p> <p>"Go, baby," was all Bobby could say. He could feel that she was about to cum and he didn't want to stop.</p> <p>Mia began to thrust herself back at him, matching his thrusts. The room was filled with the wet slap as both of them slapped each other hard.</p> <p>"Bobby," she yelled as she climaxed.</p> <p>"Ohh, BABY-OH, FUCK!"</p> <p>Bobby felt her body shudder against him as he pulled himself out of her. They were both gasping for air as they finished their orgasm with him on top.</p> <p>Bobby lifted himself off her and was able to look down at Mia as she sat on his stomach to catch her breath. He moved off the bed and took her hand and helped her gather up the bed cover from the floor and then went to the shower and added his own to the mix.</p> <p>Bobby looked at her sleeping face and smiled, "I'll come back at any time after you have cum," he added.</p> <p>"I can't wait until tomorrow morning for you to be mine again," she whispered.</p> <p>"I can't wait either. I've never had a sex that intense before and I'm dying to, but the more the merrier," he replied.</p> <p>He watched her sleep for a few moments before he got out and went back to the bedroom. When he got back to the bed he felt his heart beating a little faster knowing that Mia would be joining him again soon.</p> <p>-end-â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
