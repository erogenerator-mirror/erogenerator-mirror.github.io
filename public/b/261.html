I said to him.</p> <p>"Do you really want to go back there?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes, please do." I assured him.</p> <p>We took a brief stroll back to the house. As we were walking up the steps I reached over and took his hand and turned to face him. "Come on." I said, and we headed right up to the front door, my mind was racing, what were we thinking... what was I... would he really come willingly? Would I even be able to ask the question?</p> <p>"That's ok." he whispered.</p> <p>"What is?" I asked, I needed to know.</p> <p>"I'm not gonna have sex with you again until you're twenty," he said.</p> <p>I looked back at him surprised and a little concerned. "Are you still going to be in town a while?"</p> <p>"I'm off right now," he responded, "So are you still in town?"</p> <p>"I thought I would head back tomorrow," I answered, "But I guess it's gonna be a few more days." There was an awkward silence between us as we reached the front door.</p> <p>"Well, I'll see you then," I said as I put my arm around his shoulder, "And goodnight, good night." I turned the key in the lock and we heard it click as the latch closed. We reached the front door and we looked at each other. I knew that whatever was to be between us, we were both to blame for getting carried away. I knew that if we didn't stop it now or the night would never be the same. But I also knew something didn't feel right about it now. And as I looked at him again, the image of the night went through my mind. His hands were on my hips pulling me tight against his now throbbing cock. I looked up at him and put my palm over his lips as I felt his hand move to one of my breasts. My breath caught as he reached down and began gently massaging my nipple through my blouse. I leaned back a little and rested my head on his shoulder as he felt my breast through my blouse and bra.</p> <p>"This is exactly what I think you're planning on making me do all night long." he said in a husky voice as he brought his other hand to me and began pulling on my earlobe as I began breathing faster. As he felt that I pushed my head back and opened my eyes. "What are you doing?" I said, "I can't... I can't be doing such a thing."</p> <p>His hand moved to my side, and he leaned down and kissed me. Our kiss was tender, but it started somewhere deep inside. His lips moved as his hand moved up and down my side. I moaned at the feeling of his hand moving over me. Our hands moved together feeling each other's bodies. When I felt the bulge in the front of his pants, I looked up at him.</p> <p>"Please... make love to me while I..." I almost started saying.</p> <p>"Oh... I don't know... I want you," he said as if I knew what he was talking about.</p> <p>"Then do it," I breathed. He looked at me with passion as his fingers began to work on my nipples. "Take off her blouse," I commanded him.</p> <p>He removed my blouse and unbuttoned my skirt before reaching inside my bra. He lifted me up and kissed me again. As our bodies met and began sliding up and down, we kissed even more ferociously. His hand was moving through the hair that had fallen over my breast as our kisses grew more passionate; I could feel what it felt like the way his fingers played with my erect nipple. When I finally pushed his head away, I reached down and began massaging his balls with one hand, the other still on my pussy. He moaned and grabbed my waist as my hand moved back to his cock. I felt it stiffen in my hand at the touch of my fingers across his skin. When I looked up at him again, he was looking down at me with those big blue eyes. They were as soft as his hands had been. I leaned forward and put my lips on his.</p> <p>That kiss... I've wanted to do that... ever since he and I were on our first date. I kissed him back. I started moving my hands over his skin, feeling him move beneath my hands. Slowly, I worked my skirt and blouse off my shoulders and let it drop to the floor. I then moved to the front of his body, kissing him again as his hands went immediately to my body, undoing my bra strap, setting it on the floor beside him. My hands moved across the front of his jeansâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
