I loved her and she loved me. I think she's a total slut.</p> <p>"I need to go check on the kids. I'll call you when I can arrange things. But not today. Just stay calm."</p> <p>She walked out into the hallway.</p> <p>"Oh fuck."</p> <p>She was back. I followed her down the hall, down the short hallway and up toward the back of the apartment complex. I kept a wary eye on the building. She was right behind me.</p> <p>"I love you Mike. I'm sorry I scared you. I didn't mean for that talk to come at all. Did you have to come all this way?"</p> <p>I felt guilty. I knew she could tell this was a mistake. I was a good guy. She was a slut. But I wasn't sure she was wrong about the family.</p> <p>"No. No I didn't. Come on let's go get some food. We're going back to your room."</p> <p>She hugged me from behind, making me think her breasts were smashed against my chest. I put my arms around her. I loved her.</p> <p>"I won't tell anyone about anything you tell me," I told her gently.</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>It might have been a one word response. I still don't think so.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>A few days later:</p> <p>I had just made dinner and was just finishing doing dishes when the doorbell ran over. I was on the computer at home when she opened the door. She was wearing a black negligee. It was cut very low in front, and was very short, but she was definitely showing an ample portion of her legs. My wife was always careful not to dress inappropriately. What did happen tonight was all my imagination had dreamed up.</p> <p>"Here is food Mike."</p> <p>She was already standing in the kitchen, looking around at the table.</p> <p>I handed her the food and she stood up.</p> <p>"I'm hungry," she said. She held out her hand and we clasped hands and turned toward each other. Our clothes hit the ground and I couldn't help noticing her ample breasts push forward when she pulled me into her hug. When I kissed her, I felt desire.</p> <p>When we broke, I took the initiative and stepped into her embrace, kissing her with more energy than I could remember. It felt great, as if we had always enjoyed each other's mouths. Our breasts smashed together. I put my hands under her breasts and pressed them together, so my nipples rubbed into hers. Her lips moved in a way that was more demanding and aggressive. Her tongue pushed into my lips; my mouth opened and met hers. Our tongues were entwined and dancing all around each other. She was hot and the kissing made me want to do even more. Her hands moved down from my chest to the side of my waist. Her fingers pulled the bottom of my shirt up until it was all the way up. Her fingers moved inside the elastic and found my nipples.</p> <p>I helped her work the shirt and she worked her hands in the bottom of my shirt. Her right hand moved up to me, and she found my right breast and held it. I didn't want her fingers to move further so I pulled her toward me so my nipple would come out. We continued our embrace. Her left hand moved higher and found the edge of my shorts. I moved my hips forward when she found my cock in the open space between our bodies.</p> <p>I could feel precum running down my crack as her fingers rubbed my balls under the elastic and her left hand pulled the shorts down. I looked at the house. There had to be at least ten people in front of the door.</p> <p>In a moment, we had removed our clothes, but she kept her legs closed. She moved her body closer to me so I could easily see her pussy. The thin material of her negligee did nothing to cover her. I put my one leg over hers so my cock would rest against my thigh. She leaned into me and pulled my head forward. I kissed her right above her right ear and nibbled on the ear lobe. It sent shivers through her body.</p> <p>I kissed her earlobe again, and kissed the top of her ear and moved my hips against her. She pushed into me and my cock made contact with her crotch. She pulled me against her. I could feel the heat on the surface of our flesh. She rubbed her crotch against me and my cock felt even better.</p> <p>I was on cloud nine. I couldn't tell if something was going on that night, but I knew it would be a memorable night. I wanted to see her in action. It had been a long time since I had seen her naked.</p> <p>I was surprised when she pulled back and ran her fingers overâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
