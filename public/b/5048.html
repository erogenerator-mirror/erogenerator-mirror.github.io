They were the first to arrive at the restaurant. When they were seated at the table they were met immediately by a table of two with a woman seated between them.</p> <p>"You know this is kind of crazy" she said.</p> <p>"You never know," replied one of the men as he poured more wine, "it is a celebration of old times."</p> <p>"Now I understand," said Cindy." It is just as well, at least I will make it up to my boyfriend when we get home."</p> <p>"So do you want to join me in the men's bathroom?" asked the woman, looking over at Cindy with a quizzical look.</p> <p>"Not at the moment. It seems like a good time for us to get to know each other," replied Cindy.</p> <p>"We're ready to start with you now...," she said. The waiter smiled at them as he left the room with Cindy's drink. He got a bottle of wine from the waiter and poured them each a half full glass. They sat down and started to talk as they were getting to know one another. Cindy said, "I was going to tell you these things earlier, but you've already had enough of them. They're really pretty funny." The waiter seemed a little taken aback at the fact that Cindy's boyfriend even knew she had been a virgin when she had arrived that afternoon. She reached over to him and gave his a warm smile and said, "Don't let this bother you."</p> <p>"It would if it was me you are talking about. We'll just play a little game." The waiter took the wine glass and handed it to Cindy. All three of them sat down and talked as they tried to act as if they had known the entire time. When the waiter had come back with their wine glasses Cindy's boyfriend had been sitting next to her and when he had poured the wine for her Cindy had been leaned over towards him and had been kissing him with passion. He had put his arm around her and he had fondled her breasts gently. The waiter had asked if she had been dancing and Cindy had said she had been. The two danced around for a while longer and they were talking and laughing.</p> <p>After they had been about a half an hour the waiter returned and they began to eat their food and then Cindy said they should return to the table. The waiter said, "We really shouldn't be going, but we'll go and we could get some drinks. There is an outdoor pool outside and it's a warm weather event that we love to have." The waiter left the table and he had returned with two wine glasses. Cindy was having a hard time deciding what to order. She started to go with what she was eating because she was surprised that her stomach was turning because it had actually been two hours since she had been out. She had never even been with a man and she was finding it difficult to eat the entire meal. After lunch the waiter escorted them to a booth and opened his own bottle of red wine. When they got to the booth Cindy ordered two more for herself and a couple of other girls that were there. They were still talking by then and when the waiter had returned they were both on their second drinks and talking about college. They laughed as the waiter handed them their third drink.</p> <p>"I know you're not going to like the wine, but trust me, we will be leaving soon. And the three of us are going to go out and maybe get some dancing. I would really like to dance with you," said Cindy as she leaned over and kissed him passionately.</p> <p>"I don't know...maybe I would like to stay if we could do something else."</p> <p>"We will see."</p> <p>After they had eaten their food they sat back in the booth and chatted for a while and then they went inside and Cindy ordered another round of drinks for all of them. When the waiter returned the three of them were talking about the evening when the waiter returned with their drinks. He asked if Cindy and her boyfriend had been drinking and she had told him no and she had no plans to return. He asked if Cindy had any other plans since the last time they were up after they had had their drinks and she said no. He had gone to the bathroom without her noticing and the waiter offered to drive out. They had both agreed that they would like to continue the evening in which he had brought his two glasses with them.</p> <p>Cindy had been drinking a little more since the last time they had and it wasn't long before the waiter brought their third cocktail and they were about to start to take their second sips when she said "There is one more thing on my bucket listâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
