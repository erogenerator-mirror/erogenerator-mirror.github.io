She held him, letting him feel the warmth of her body. Then they walked, holding hands. When they reached the dock they stopped, kissing, their hands feeling each other. She walked away, and he followed her to the dock. He turned and stared at her, his cock still hard, his hands caressed her ass. Then she grabbed his cock, and they began walking again. When they got to the dock, she walked him under the water, and he walked under the water. He kissed her neck, she turned, then looked him over.</p> <p>"Your cock is still hard, do you like it?" she asked him.</p> <p>"Very much," he said, and then put his hands on her thighs, pulling her legs apart. He slid two fingers into her, moving his cock as he did so. She groaned as she felt it, it was as hard as a rock. He leaned forward, his lips near her ear and began licking it. He began licking her ear, sucking at the lobe. He turned her toward the water and began fingering her pussy again, his hands moving up and down her ass, squeezing it with each stroke. His cock was now out, it was bobbing, and he moved his body slowly back, getting closer to cumming. He knelt, his shaft at her face, she took it into her mouth. He pulled her closer, and she wrapped her lips around it, her tongue flicking it. He pulled her closer, and she sucked on him, running her tongue along the underside of his shaft, her hand running under the water, rubbing him all over. He moved his hips against her face, trying to cum. She smiled, then began sucking it again, her hand running up the outside of his shaft. He tried to move closer, his hips began to drive against her face harder, making her gag on his cock. Suddenly he came, his hips jerked, the first shot went straight down her throat. She continued to suck as hard and as fast as the waves rippled through. He lay there, his cock still in her mouth, and his eyes were closed.</p> <p>She opened her eyes, smiling, sitting up, looking at him in the water. Then she lay on top of him. She kissed him gently, his cock still in her mouth. "Oh God that was amazing," she said, breathing deeply.</p> <p>"You're amazing," he replied.</p> <p>"Oh, so I really do taste like you," she said.</p> <p>"And it's sweet too," he replied, pulling his face close to hers.</p> <p>She reached between her legs and began to rub his shaft, it began to hard again, the head beginning to swell. She kissed him softly, her tongue licking at his lips several times. Then she rolled off him. He lay there, looking at the water, his cock, hard as a rock as she came down. When he was hard again, she knelt, moving to the water, her hands caressing his shaft. "I thought maybe you'd never get it," she said. She climbed into the water. He was already out, his cock hard, the head of it glistening against the red, angry lines of the dark.</p> <p>"I think I shall find you," she said, moving past him and walking into the house. She went upstairs, naked, her pussy glistening with her moisture. She came back down and walked to the tub, stepping into the water and looking at his cock. "I suppose I shall have to take some more time, shall I?" she asked, and stepped into the water.</p> <p>"Ah, no," he said. "I'm still hard," he said as he took his cock in his hands.</p> <p>"I'm sure I will find you, soon," she said, and then reached into the water, her hand stroking it. She walked toward him, kneeling, his arms wrapping around her legs, holding her. She lowered her mouth to the tip of his cock, sliding her tongue down the shaft, then she raised herself slightly, sliding the tip of her tongue around his head. She raised her body, her knees sliding closer to his ass, her hands reaching over the head of him, fingers wrapping around the shaft.</p> <p>"Oh God," he groaned. He was very hard. She sucked on him, first, a tight wet circle, then she began lifting herself over him, the top of his cock coming up over the head. She continued up, over his cock, then dropped and slid it into her wet pussy, her tongue licking around the tip. Slowly, deliberately, she was working up and down his shaft. Her hips began to move slowly, her fingers stroking her swollen clit the entire time. "Fuck me, please fuck me," she told him.</p> <p>"Not until youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
