You know, it would definitely get me a hot young dick," she offered.</p> <p>"Really, you are not only just 19?" he asked, trying to take my innocence back with his eyes. I felt myself blushing, and the blush in my face deepened as he stared into my eyes. I felt his cock stiffening in his pants as he looked at me.</p> <p>"I'm 22, and I'll be your age in a couple of years."</p> <p>"So when?" he asked.</p> <p>"Soon maybe."</p> <p>"What about you?" he asked.</p> <p>"Why? Have you never done it before?"</p> <p>"Of course not," he said.</p> <p>"Well, then," I said, "why didn't you ask before? You know... I could tell you were really nervous."</p> <p>"Naked or not, yes," he offered.</p> <p>"Come on, I guess you really aren't a virgin and if you want to do it, you need to be ready for it. Besides, I'm not exactly on the straight razor." I added.</p> <p>"Well, I'm not a virgin. I'm twenty-four, I'm married as of ten days ago and I'm a virgin until the day before I go to college."</p> <p>"Come on, what would it do to a married man?" he replied.</p> <p>"Well... I don't have a husband, I don't have a boyfriend, I don't have a date..."</p> <p>"Whoa, now what? I'm not asking to be a prude."</p> <p>I looked at him, confused.</p> <p>"I didn't just tell you..." I said, surprised how quickly this conversation between the two had begun.</p> <p>"No, really? I mean, I thought you didn't have a great time," I said.</p> <p>"Oh yeah, well, I do have an average sized dick but I just haven't had one. I don't take chances."</p> <p>"Ok," I said, relieved.</p> <p>"Well, I'm 18, right?" He said, sounding hopeful</p> <p>"... Yeah, just in my cycle."</p> <p>"Oh... no, my cycle wasn't this long... right?"</p> <p>"Yeah, right." I said, feeling my stomach drop.</p> <p>"Then, why don't we go back to that and you can ask your questions to ease your mind and get to know it!" He said and held his hand out towards my pants.</p> <p>"Haha, that's the spirit!" I said with a sigh and went into his arms, he placed my hands in his and looked at me with a look that said 'You're a sweet girl.' I was more than happy to have a piece of that sweet, innocent young boy!</p> <p>We returned to our own world and he made me feel as if just a few hours ago I was living a daydream to which I was pretty much unaware. This was way more fun than our little escapade was in itself. We had our own little town and our own home. I knew what he had in mind by the way the air seemed to be buzzing from the house. The scent of his cologne filled my senses... and I began to see a vision in my mind.</p> <p>"Well, your father always made me wear this," he said, handing me what I thought was a big silver belt belt.</p> <p>He walked into the bedroom, I followed close behind, keeping him at a distance from me.</p> <p>"Don't you get nervous?" I whispered in his ear, brushing his hair behind his ear.</p> <p>"Nope, I'm not," he said.</p> <p>"Good," I said, "because I don't think so, do you?" I reached out and grabbed and turned the stereo on.</p> <p>"Um... well, sort of, yeah. It's just kind of a tradition," he laughed back then looked at me with a questioning look in his eyes.</p> <p>"I'm sure of what it means. I just want to know so I can say hello and see if you're interested or not."</p> <p>"Um... well, there are lots of ways to be interested but never go that far."</p> <p>"Sure, just trust me. You'll find me here when you need me. Ok?" I smiled at him mischievously.</p> <p>"Ok," he smiled back nervously.</p> <p>"Go ahead and look at me," I said as I turned on the stereo.</p> <p>She had a lovely face and I thought she had a beautiful body. I knew it wasn't her, but I also really found her very attractive. If she hadn't already been a girl I would have said my sister and her ex were best friends but I never thought I would say that about my ex.
