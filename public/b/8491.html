Lorna sighed deeply. "God."</p> <p>"Are you happy?" The doctor asked earnestly.</p> <p>"Mmm," Lorna groaned.</p> <p>'I can't get enough of him,' she thought. 'How do I ever be able to love a man?' There was something about seeing her with a doctor that she loved.</p> <p>"You okay?" she asked as she sat up.</p> <p>"I don't think I can take anything that good either... I have had some weird dreams," Lorna said. "But I'm okay."</p> <p>"You feel better?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Good," he said, then he bent over and kissed her tenderly on the lips. "Thank you so much for everything... for the best doctor ever," he said as he turned and left the room.</p> <p>"So," the doctor said as he came back in. "Why did you come to see me?"</p> <p>"I got in trouble," she replied. Then she looked at her feet nervously and blushed.</p> <p>'What is it with you?' he said under his breath as he watched her walk briskly out of her bedroom and into the hallway.</p> <p>She was already in her bed when he knocked and opened the door slowly and deliberately. She was in the middle of her bed, just as impatient as he was but still unsure what to do.</p> <p>"I'm sorry if I startled you," the doctor said softly. "It was not... well, not unexpected that it happened, was it?"</p> <p>"No," Lorna replied quickly. "Not at all."</p> <p>"I'm so, so sorry for this... I've been having nightmares," Lorna said, looking out of the bedroom window. "I've had nightmares. It's nothing you can't handle... it's a man thing that's been bugging me for a while.</p> <p>'What was it like?' She thought to herself. 'What did you do with him?' She smiled. "I just... I... we all have our needs. What we... we have to get to know each other better, right?" Lorna smiled at her words and nodded. "No, it's okay. Come on," He said as he reached for her hand. "Come on."</p> <p>"Okay, if the need arises... just let me know," she said as she walked out of the bedroom into the hallway and to the bathroom.</p> <p>Lorna came out of the bathroom and looked at herself in the mirror. She ran her hands over her breasts, squeezing them gently and then letting them go as she brushed her hair. Then she turned slowly and looked at her face.</p> <p>She looked at her face for a long time, seeing her expression and wondering how her face would look if the doctor came in there and touched her. "Do you feel alright?" he said after a while.</p> <p>"Yes," Lorna said as she let her hands go to her chin and looked down at her face. "No, it's fine. I'm sorry," she whispered. "I... you make me feel good all the time."</p> <p>The doctor was standing inside the bathroom doorway to his bedroom. He had pulled the cover off the sink and was pouring a mug of coffee. He looked back at Lorna as she walked into the room. He saw the doctor's face as if to make his decision quickly. His expression had changed suddenly, and he looked serious.</p> <p>"I think," he said, "that you might need a little privacy."</p> <p>Lorna sat on Lorna's bed while the doctor studied Lorna's face and features for a while. Then she walked out of the bathroom, into Lorna's bedroom as far as she could reach before she had to stand up. Then she closed her bedroom door and walked out into the hallway.</p> <p>"Can I see you again?" Lorna asked quietly.</p> <p>"Of course you can."</p> <p>"I... I would like that," Lorna said, still thinking of the doctor as if she was asking him to come to her bed.</p> <p>"I'll be waiting for you," the doctor said as he stepped to the foot of the bed with Lorna next to him.</p> <p>Their faces came together in an intensely long stare. "I've only had dreams about someone like you," she whispered. "This... isn't too much. I understand what you think I'm going through. I don't think this will be anything that I can't handle..."</p> <p>The doctor paused. His face was now almost in her line of vision. Lorna was sure that she had tears in her eyes as she looked at him. Then a long silence broke in the room.</p> <p>"Willâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
