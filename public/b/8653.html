But you are in for an evening." I nodded, and let the conversation carry to a second level.</p> <p>"You have a nice ass, too."</p> <p>"Yes, that's what you always say," I sighed.</p> <p>"Well, that means something." She ran her fingers down the crease of my thigh toward my balls. She grabbed them and leaned into me, her lips pressing into mine. Her tongue snaked in between her lips and then retreated, swirling around and around my cock. My dick ached as she pressed on it.</p> <p>She was good at this.</p> <p>I turned myself around and we kissed for a good minute. She took my cock in one hand and stroked me with her thumb.</p> <p>I pushed into her harder, our mouths locked into an erotic, passionate embrace. The kiss grew stronger and we fucked on the floor. My balls hurt as we held each other off the floor. I felt her hand wrap around my cock, and her small thumb stroke me over and over. I pulled her hair back from her neck and kissed her ear. She put her leg over mine and her knee in my lap.</p> <p>"Take me upstairs," she whispered.</p> <p>"I have a friend up at the top of the stairs," I said. "I can't go that way. That would be too awkward."</p> <p>"Well, that's just fine. Take us up there," she said, moving a bit so she was almost in my lap. She raised her right leg to wrap her leg over mine as her hand kept stroking me and then, she slowly lowered herself onto me.</p> <p>She felt so warm and so firm. Her breasts hung in front of me. I could feel her nipple hard underneath. The air on my cock felt electric. She began to fuck me, pushing me inside and then backing off. I pulled her leg down so I could kiss her and she kissed me back. Her pussy was getting wetter and I could feel it, the friction of it. I pushed my lips up against hers. She moaned into my mouth as we locked in the embrace.</p> <p>"Take me," she said again. Her pussy opened as the lips of her pussy pushed in, parting her slit and exposing her clit. She pulled my head down toward her chest and I kissed her, hard. Then we both kissed and sucked at her nipples. She started to shake and her grip tightened on me.</p> <p>"Take me, now," she said.</p> <p>I pushed myself up from the floor and pulled her up toward her feet. She leaned over and kissed me, hard. Then she stood and wrapped her arms around my neck. She kissed me hard and then lifted up, my cock coming out of her pussy. I got to her waist and she bent, taking a cock in each hand, pointing it towards her. She began to stroke it. I was on fire as I watched her small hand rub the head and then she dropped her pussy to engulf me. She was wet and hot and tight. I could feel the tightness of her pussy as she slid down on me. We fucked, hard and fast as we kissed and fondled one another. I felt the wetness of her pussy as she moved against me. I could hold back no longer. My cock expanded and I felt the warmth as an orgasm ripped through me, causing me to shoot my seed into her.</p> <p>"Oh, my God, I don't know how it happened," she laughed.</p> <p>"It happens!" I chuckled.</p> <p>"No, it must have. What about those other boys? I haven't had the time to masturbate after you did that. I'm so sorry!" she said. I pulled her close, and kissed her passionately. I felt her hand grasp my cock as we broke the kiss. She stroked my cock until she saw the head.</p> <p>"You want to cum inside me?" she asked.</p> <p>I could only nod.</p> <p>"Take off my panties and fuck me."</p> <p>"Yes," I answered, my cock fully erect again. I took off her panties and laid her down on the bed. Then I knelt on the bed facing her, my cock pointing forward so I could feel how it touched her.</p> <p>"I want you to lick me again," I whispered as I kneeled in the center of her.</p> <p>This is better. She had never asked me to eat her. Not at first, but eventually she'd gone through a phase where I had never done it and I'd never had this chance. "Yes, please," I gasped. So, she'd asked, I decided. I started, slowly, licking along her thighs, between her legs and then into her pussy. Just like the other girls, her lips were puffed out from my licking.
