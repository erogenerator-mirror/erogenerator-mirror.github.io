Will I have to leave him?”</p> <p>I reached and removed the gag. “You are not leaving and do not dare cry out of fear like a baby,” I instructed. “I can get away by telling the men to do this.” Once the gag was off, I leaned closer to her and whispered in her ear. She could sense that I was trying to get a message out. “They may come, however,” I continued. “They may do that, even before I leave you. You will think of that day, and you will always be ready to do it;” I gave her last point and she knew I meant business. I pulled my cock out into the dark air. She reached over and grabbed it in her hand. It is still as hard as ever.</p> <p>I was already rubbing the tip against her lips when she slid it inside her mouth, and I rubbed the head across her lips and clit as she sucked on the tip with her tongue. I leaned down and began kissing her. We kissed, slowly at first but building between them till my desire for her grew. I felt her tongue slide its way out along my teeth and across my lips. Our juices were mixing with hers.</p> <p>I began rubbing her head like she was rubbing her clit. She sucked harder on my lips and nibbled on my lip. I moved my mouth from her lips and moved to her neck and began kissing and licking the sweat that was pouring from every inch of her body. Her body began to shudder. I moved my hand to her tit and began tweaking her nipple.</p> <p>“Hmmm,” she moaned. “Mmmmmm….”</p> <p>I slipped her shirt off without stopping my kisses down her neck. I removed her bra, and her tits fell out like a soft warm blanket. I was now kissing down from her neck. I kissed her stomach. Her pussy was wet and swollen. I spread her thighs wider, and slipped my tongue in between her clit. She began to buck her hips. Her hands were still holding me by the head. I stood back up and moved to kneel behind her. I grabbed her hips, and slowly pulled her towards me. She felt like my cock was on fire. My tongue ran across her dripping lips. I sucked each one into my mouth in turn, and licked and nibbled at each of her folds. She was breathing faster now. She was moaning and begging for release. Her body began to get closer. I pushed my way deeper between her lips.</p> <p>“Oh…oh…oh…oh God….you're going to…don't stop….please don’t stop…” she was out of words at first. I felt her quiver on my fingers. I pushed one then two inside her body and began to move them in and out in her hole. She started to shake. Her hips bucked wildly onto my mouth, and she was getting closer to release. I could see her hand reaching around the front of her body, and her fingers started to rub her clit. I grabbed my cock and grabbed around her hips. I began to move my cock in and from there she could take it. She bucked hard onto my cock. “Yes, yes,” she moaned. “Hurt me, hurt me, please…”</p> <p>She pulled back as far as she could but just barely. Her head hung from the side of the bar. “Oh God…yes, yes…please, God, I can’t stop, just a bit deeper, please,” she begged. She was almost there. Her knees began to shake, so I pulled back. I positioned my cock, but I pulled her with me. My cock was almost too far to pass. She was still so wet from our fucking and as it slid in, it filled her completely.</p> <p>I didn’t stop this time. I fucked her until she had cum several times.</p> <p>I left the way she was, and went to the next table, where I retrieved the key from her pocket which she would keep until my wife would come in. She was still panting, and she was leaning back against a table in the corner.</p> <p>“How many times was that, slave?”</p> <p>She looked up and smiled at me.</p> <p>“Did I hurt you?” she asked. She shook her head a minute.</p> <p>“No, you did very well,” I replied. I kissed her gently. We kissed for a while longer. I was about to do the same for her. I wanted to make love this way. We kissed for—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
