I want to have a man in me as often as possible, if he likes me...please!" And she did. Her entire body went into convulsions as he held her, pushing her toward the peak. As he felt his balls start to quiver from the intensity, he pulled her back down, still in his arms.</p> <p>He kissed her as he began to kiss her neck softly with his lips. Slowly, he kissed his way up to her earlobe, nibbling on it gently. It sent a shiver of excitement racing from her neck to her nipples, now erect from the cool air. He kissed his way to her earlobes, where his tongue slid sensuously over them. He kissed her chin, then her neck as he started to kiss down to her collarbone. He looked her straight in the eyes as he kissed down, her skin seemed as flush as the day they met, and she trembled at the look of wanton desire in his face as they slowly approached her breasts.</p> <p>He kissed the small valley between her twin peaks, his lips never leaving her skin. She arched her back as he licked the nipple of her left breast to her heart. Her back arched in anticipation and as he kissed down her abdomen his tongue teased a line down the center, never touching her most sensitive parts. As his face neared her pubes, he stopped and slowly slid down her body again with a soft rasp, letting his tongue trace her belly button. She shivered as he reached the top of her triangle of pubes, and he kissed her skin gently as he slid up and down between her legs again.</p> <p>He paused just long enough to reach up and open her hood; her body shuddered again, as goosebumps formed by their contact. Her thighs instinctively spread and clamped themselves around his head as he continued to tease her with his tongue. As the hood relaxed, he placed little kisses into the front of her lips and across her clit. She was so wet his tongue was as slippery as her own juices.</p> <p>"Mmmmm, keep that up, and you'll like it a lot!"</p> <p>He kissed and licked toward her slit and slowly kissed up and down, up and down, moving from side to side, teasing. She let her legs come up just until her calves met her knees and her thighs pressed hard into his ears where he paused. As he kissed around her pussy, he held his hand out to her so he could lick her. Her clitty felt the warmth of his mouth as he blew on her clit. She was moaning and moving her hips into him as she felt her body shake with the pleasure of his ministrations. He continued to kiss his way up and over her belly, stopping just before his mouth completely touched her lips.</p> <p>She was moaning softly now, her hands grasping onto his head for support. He continued to tease her and was sure at the same time that she was going to enjoy the fullness of him inside her. As her moaning became louder, he took one of his hands and slowly slid his finger into her pussy. He smiled and licked her lips as he felt for the G-Spot. As he slid his finger in and out, he took his thumb and slid it up and down her clit, moving just the tip up and down as he felt her orgasm approach. Her breath caught in her throat as she felt her body tingle. She moaned in pleasure as his thumb rubbed his clit, making her body shiver and pulse against his. As her pleasure became more pleasurable, she began to tremble and convulse in his arms with her orgasm, which felt so powerful she could feel every muscle in her body spasm. She felt his tongue work its way around a breast as he fingered her cunt, moving his mouth away from hers so she could feel her tongue instead.</p> <p>He lifted his face up so he could see her face. He slowly kissed up and down her body, letting his tongue slide over her flesh as much as it could. She moved forward so that her tits could be kissed and caressed. His fingers continued to work her cunt and clit, moving around as he went up and down to get her ready for his cock. She moved over to the desk, and grabbed the back of it with one hand so she could pull it over to the end so he could get his cock inside her. She moved his cock in and out of her pussy, keeping his cock moving in and out as she guided it to her waiting pussy.</p> <p>He felt her hands on his back as he lowered her so they could lay down on either side of her. She held his cock with both hands, her eyes locked on his and her face looking at him a whole new way. He slid his cock into her wetness with a quick thrust and sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
