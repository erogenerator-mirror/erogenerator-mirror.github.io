Now I'm going to kiss you.</p> <p>I looked back to see the most beautiful woman in the world kiss you, her eyes, the look of pure lust in the firelight as I moved my lips down her chin and over to the top of her breast. My body jerked then I moaned. She bit my bottom lip gently. I slid my hands up her inner thighs feeling her. She was soft and wet and tasted delightful. Her breasts were magnificent, not as large as I like, but still quite pleasant. I kissed her as the other girls did, gently, gently, enjoying her taste, savoring the feel of her body. She kissed back. Then pulled away and began to suck hard. Her hands were in my hair, and I could feel hers as they kneaded my cheek.</p> <p>She stood up, taking me by the hand and leading me back towards her bed. I followed her into the bedroom with her leading me by my hand. We were right in this. She lay down, leaving me in a semi-slumber. I moved to the edge of the bed and looked through the opening in our room into hers. We made eye contact. A look of lust, desire, and desire. I stood up and kissed her, and she moaned and moved her body against mine. She broke the kiss, kissing me long and deep. Her arms around me, pulling me close. Our lips met and she began to slowly grind herself against me. Her breasts, and the nipples which I held, rolled in my palms. Her legs were wrapped around me, and I slid my hips into hers. We made out for a few minutes, and then I broke the kiss again. I kissed her neck, and her jaw. She kissed my lips, my throat and my chest. She took hold of my hardness. I put my cock on the lips of her pussy. I slid them on and off of her, making a sticky trail at the head. She put her thighs across mine, and I slid all the way into her. Our kiss was fierce and deep, and filled with lust. She began to slide herself up and down the length of my shaft. Her fingers dug into my chest as she pulled my face to hers for more contact between our mouths. She bit my shoulder as her pace quickened.</p> <p>She moaned louder the closer we got, and her thighs clamped around me. I could feel the moisture coating my cock, seeping out of her and running down over my balls. This, combined with our grinding, made me swell and a feeling of deep emotion washed over me. A feeling I'd not felt in years. We were moving furiously, meeting each other in a wave, building. She took hold of my wrists again as her mouth found mine again and kissed me. I could taste the metallic taste of salt in her mouth as she bit on my bottom lip. I knew she felt it and it was arousing her in a way I hadn't felt before. I thrust my hip into hers as she was grinding, meeting me. She broke the kiss, her mouth on mine with my own on hers. Her body shuddered against me as her orgasm overtook her. She pulled away looking straight into me and whispered, "I love you."</p> <p>Her words had a weight in them. I knew I'd been wrong. I didn't want to be wrong. I told her so.</p> <p>"I love your mouth." She said it so softly I almost didn't hear. She kissed me again. She looked into my eyes. In her eyes, I saw a deep need, and my heart soared, breaking, just from seeing that. She kissed me again. And this time deep and hard. Her tongue came out to meet mine. Our tongues entwined, dancing and playing and pushing. I felt her hand on my chest playing with the silk of my shirt as her breath hit my mouth. I unbuttoned it, and took hold of her hand to pull the shirt away from her body. She lifted it, exposing her smooth skin. Her fingers found the hair at the back of my neck as she pulled my face to hers. Our lips locked. She put her arms on my sides and thrust her hips into me, rubbing her clit against me. I put my lips to hers again, and pushed into her as I could again, knowing it would be too much. She pulled away slightly. I kissed her cheek, my neck, my chest, my stomach. Her fingers dug into my ass as she pulled me into her. "Loving me" was my answer. She broke the kiss and I kissed her, again. I kissed down her neck, across her chest and back. I licked the sweat off of her, and nibbled on her ear. She moaned. I continued. My tongue traced her breast, and found her nipple and then it was the last kiss.
