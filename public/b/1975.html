Also, I do have some ideas on how we were conceived.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I woke in a strange place, the bed had shifted again and the scent of fresh breakfast filling the room. My skin crawled as the cool air hit it.</p> <p>"What time is it?" I groaned, feeling refreshed.</p> <p>"Not sure," Matt said, "a bit early but before that" he added with a wicked glint in his eyes. "Oh and don't expect me to join you in the tub..." he chuckled, looking right at me.</p> <p>I was still on my back and my eyes darted back and forth, my mouth getting dry and my insides feeling as though they were opening to admit air like a fly that wants to get out. "Whoa," I mumbled to myself under my breath, "this morning I'll need to get up and do something."</p> <p>I looked around, and saw that my clothes were in shreds, "That's not how it should have gone," I muttered to myself as I struggled to clean myself up, "it should have been me."</p> <p>I quickly changed, finding that my underwear had come off. I quickly ran into the bathroom, grabbed my bra and panties as well as my robe, and put them on. I made my way through the house, which had since been totally quiet, just as I was feeling a little embarrassed in front of everyone. I headed for the kitchen, where the food was already half eaten, "I'll just get myself something while you're gone," I told myself as I walked by the open window.</p> <p>"Hey you're up! I need to talk to you." Matt called from the top of the stairs.</p> <p>"Sure, I'm having some breakfast," I called back, "follow me. And don't worry, I'm not really in a rush to come out here."</p> <p>We made our way down the stairs, making more eye contact with each step. The breakfast food was nothing to brag about, but it tasted good and smelled wonderful, like a fresh day's meal. I was starving and the only thing left to do was get to the shower, get dressed, and try to take care of myself.</p> <p>I sat down in the same chair as Matt had been in, my mind still trying to grasp the situation. Matt had made plans for us to see a movie during the day, with my birthday already present. As was probably the worst part of any present, we had agreed we'd spend the day there, but it was the best movie we'd ever seen. I didn't care what we agreed to, I had already been there and that was the end of it. We'd been together so long now that it was only fair that we got together with him whenever and wherever we wanted to have our cake and eat all of it.</p> <p>"Are you getting dressed yourself?" Matt asked while he grabbed a robe off of the back of his bedroom door.</p> <p>"Yes," I said, taking my own robe, "I'm going to get out of that robe and go shower. Can I borrow something?"</p> <p>"Absolutely not," Matt grinned, as he grabbed some toothbrushes and opened the door again. "This looks as though you need to take your robe off too," he commented as he stepped into the bathroom, "but I can see your back. It's got to be a burn."</p> <p>I heard Matt close the door, but couldn't take it for more than a few seconds, "Just one," I called and hurriedly pulled my robe and my clothes out of the bedroom.</p> <p>It was a bit cramped, the room was already beginning to smell like a bad hotel, but thankfully I found the bathroom with no problems, "just to be quiet" I told myself, "it's fine when you're with your lover though, he's not that keen." I opened the shower door as Matt's hand wrapped itself around his cock.</p> <p>"Damn," I swore, "I bet you're already hard as a rock," I teased as he released himself out onto the tile.</p> <p>I quickly stepped into the shower, quickly washing off my make from the day, and toweled off. "This looks like it might help" I said as I put on some pants and a tee shirt that only went down to mid thigh, "but what about something more comfortable?" I asked as I started rummaging through my bag. I pulled out a pair of loose sweat pants that I knew were going to give me a backache later in the day.</p> <p>I found my cell phone charger, plugged it into the charger, and quickly started my computer.</p> <p>A few minutes later, I heard the television start to make someâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
