I headed for a pantry to help him.</p> <p>"What about lunch tonight?" I asked.</p> <p>"Don't worry," he replied, "I'll be up and ready."</p> <p>"And how did I help you, Sir?"</p> <p>"Oh, that's nothing like I had planned," he said with a sly smile. I was dumbfounded, but didn't know what to say. I knew I had to get my mind off of things, so I told him.</p> <p>He looked down at me with a puzzled look on his face. "Oh? What's that, Sir?" I asked.</p> <p>"You really should wear a skirt today. It will be the most revealing of outfits." He said. I could feel my face heating up in embarrassment.</p> <p>"Yes, Sir. Sorry, Sir," I answered.</p> <p>"You don't need to apologize. I told you if you didn't want to stop, you could. You are an attractive young woman and I'm pleased that this is something that is a part of me." He continued. He was right. It was something that he wanted a lot. He asked me if I was comfortable wearing anything. I told him it was fine. He told me to go ahead and put on jeans. I pulled on a pair of jeans that I would normally wear, but I knew better and hoped that they fitted well. I put on a pink button down shirt that was a bit too short, but fit loosely so that there were no buttons. I also pulled on a pair of knee length black boots that ended at the top of my bare feet.</p> <p>I went back to the living room to start dinner. I had to go to the kitchen to start it and make it, which always made me extremely nervous around strangers. When I was done, I went to the kitchen to grab some salad, but I had no idea what to do with myself. I was just looking around at the various dishes when I felt a hand brush against my bare knee. It felt so good! I stopped what I was doing to look at him, but I just could not bring myself to look him in the eyes. He kept going for some time. Finally I looked him in the face. What a wonderful, beautiful, young man he was! He wore his glasses, and he was very confident and seemed to be looking back at me when he did. His lips were very warm and he was looking at me with those eyes full of love. He kept looking at me as well. He had the same big smile on his face, but it was not quite that sexy.</p> <p>"Thank you, Sir." I said, and reached out my hand. He took it and put it at the back of my hand. He looked at me, waiting for my answer. I held it slightly and looked him in the eye. I could not get over the feel of his hand on my knee, a little too much.</p> <p>"I...I didn't mean for it to feel this way...but yes, it does." I said as I looked him in the eye. It was one of those times where it felt good that I actually spoke to him. He smiled back at me with his eyes and smiled. So much love I have felt in those first few days. If I had been alone for a few minutes, I would have let out a sigh of relief. The feeling of happiness was so sudden, so beautiful, that it just washed over me. The emotions were very hot to trot and so strong, that I felt like I could lose myself in them, for no reason or reason! The feeling was wonderful, but so strong, too.</p> <p>"Is it really alright with you, Sir?" I asked, trying to be as sincere as I could.</p> <p>"I'm happy that you approve of my opinion. It's nice to say that, too," he said. I smiled at that and thanked him. I started to finish the salad when he stopped me.</p> <p>"We need to talk about some things." He said with a smile on his face. I did not know what to say as my mind was swimming with thoughts I thought might have taken us years ago.</p> <p>"Okay," I replied.</p> <p>"First, I know there is something special between you and me. We have very much in common. When I'm in town I have you in my life. When I'm out and around, we both go out in different social circles. I can't be open to the people that I am with," he said.</p> <p>"I understand. That makes me happy," I assured him.</p> <p>"Then, there may be something we can learn from each other. I would like that very much, but I also would like that we can share some of your knowledge about me."
