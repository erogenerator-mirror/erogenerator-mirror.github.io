Good luck with your training. You are a fast study. No time for rest until the final exam is done."</p> <p>I nodded. It was going to be good. The final exam is very important. I thought, but only a little. This is what being a virgin is, but it's my first time, it's the first time I've ever been a girl, and it's been a long time. I'm not sure how many more years I'll have before I meet my destiny. The only thing I know is that I'm in for it.</p> <p>She was the most beautiful girl. In her late thirties, she was the tallest blonde I'd ever seen, even the most athletic one. I was just wondering how old she was. I've never met anyone younger than me. I think, if you're going to do the tests, you might as well start doing what you've been reading or studying.</p> <p>We got the paper from her teacher and I read it. She was not a very smart teacher, but that really was the reason she was teaching us again, she was really the teacher, and I thought she was just perfect.</p> <p>I'm really beginning to appreciate her, you don't think it's impossible if she's just a little girl, you're just getting to get an education. I know we're still in the second semester of high school, and I'm still in second grade, so I'm starting to look like a really good kid.</p> <p>I'm almost done, so I ask her some questions, and she says, "Yes, you don't need to bother. I can do it. You don't have to tell me something you don't agree with before and give me a demonstration."</p> <p>I asked if it was okay.</p> <p>"That's fine. I can give you an idea, but I won't do it on a scale of one to ten. I can only use that scale, so you don't have to know what's different. Your answer to each question is to just tell me how you like the answer, so you can give it to me."</p> <p>I'm not sure if she was trying to get me to volunteer because she was worried about the answer and if she misjudged me.</p> <p>When she did ask, I said, "I don't agree with you that it's okay, but I think you're making a good job of it. I don't think I'm going to be giving it to you because I doubt that you'll be able to do anything worth doing when you get your first exam, but if you do that exam, then that's up to you."</p> <p>"There are only two exams that can go, and I would suggest you do something about those exams."</p> <p>She paused and said, "Yes, please pass your exam. It doesn't have to be at that lab that I'm going in right now."</p> <p>I agreed, and handed her the paper and asked her to go on to the next exam.</p> <p>After she was finished, she said, "Thank you for doing the exam today that I've had to do, but in the future, if you are ready, it will be your turn next."</p> <p>"I know that this is hard for you to do in the early days. We should try to be more assertive, but let's try to be more assertive. I've always liked being assertive. Now, try to concentrate."</p> <p>"You're the boss."</p> <p>"Yes, I know that. Now take a moment and look at the desk, which is behind you. You should take a seat, there's a place to sit. That's my office."</p> <p>"Thank you for being so considerate."</p> <p>"It's a deal. You didn't have to say something, so I let you."</p> <p>I sat and watched her, she looked like a teenager. If it wasn't for the fact that the top left half of her shirt was half unbuttoned showing, I couldn't have told you how she looked. But she'd have to look down, I was about to start looking into the paper. When she stood up, her shirt buttoned so that her chest was partially covered by it. She was just teasing me. I sat and did my best to look into the paper.</p> <p>After a few moments of what appeared to be a nervousness, she said, "Well, that's a good start. Now, you should remember that you won't be doing any work if you don't get to know each other."</p> <p>"Yes, I know that."</p> <p>"Yes, I know. In fact, now that you're doing the exam, I think that we really ought to start our second meeting."</p> <p>"Yeah, we can try to talk about our exams."</p> <p>"No that'sâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
