"Mmm, that feels so nice."</p> <p>"You can start now," he said. He took off her shorts and she quickly stepped out of them. As his hands slowly traced his hands up her thighs, he slowly kissed and licked the exposed skin from her thighs to her panties. Alicia's hands moved to reach for the waistband of his pants and found him standing there completely aroused.</p> <p>She felt her stomach quiver as his hand slowly reached the waistband of her panties, his fingers pushing the fabric aside and touching her through the soft fabric. Her hands immediately slid inside and felt the softness of him. His fingers moved in little circles as she closed her eyes again before slowly pulling the material away from her body, over her hips and then completely off.</p> <p>"So pretty," he whispered quietly. He gazed at her body while she continued to stroke his cock with her fingers.</p> <p>Alicia slid her fingers down to his balls, holding them slightly apart. "You've got a beautiful shaved pussy," she said. "Let me run my lips up to your clit."</p> <p>Backing off the chair she moved in front of him. Still on her knees she leaned over him until their noses were almost touching. Still on her knees she kissed his chest and licked his nipples, then moved the tip of her tongue to the areola.</p> <p>"Oh, my," he moaned.</p> <p>She gently slid her body down his body until his erection was brushing her lips. Alicia gently caressed it between her lips. He was so turned on by the feel of her lips and tongue that she felt like she should hold her breath and hold him with her mouth forever. Instead she slid her lips down his stomach and his manhood slipped into her mouth a little bit but not as much as she would have liked.</p> <p>"I've waited so long for this," she whispered in his ear. She was just thinking of that time she was about to finally have him deep in her throat when he leaned her back and guided her back toward his cock. He slowly pulled off her panties, leaving just his head in her mouth before she felt it. She couldn't believe it but her insides were tightening and she knew it was coming.</p> <p>As she pushed back down he slowly started to penetrate her. "Please don't," she said, taking her mouth off his cock to breath, "I'm so sore there. I don't think you're going to be able to go it," she said.</p> <p>"You're tight again," he said as he withdrew. "You're just too tight in there. Do you want to try anything else?"</p> <p>"I want my lips to go all the way down on you," she answered.</p> <p>He slowly pushed her legs way back so her knees were back toward her chest. Her hands guided his cock to her, which she was very wet from their initial encounter but the feeling of being stretched stretched as he entered was just so much better. She knew from the gentle sounds she made that he was right. He seemed to really enjoy the change of position and kept pushing at her, getting as much of him into her as he could. "Do that," she said pulling his cock out only to immediately push back into him. They quickly had his full length inside of her and she couldn't believe how big he felt.</p> <p>"Fuck," he whispered as they were once again starting to move together. "That feels so nice," she said. In between their bodies, he was still trying to be the good boyfriend she wanted to be, trying to make her feel safe but she wasn't taking care of herself. When he said there was no way he could go deeper or longer inside of her she was so turned on that she just wanted to move and fuck him but she couldn't move her body at all. He was still as hard as a rock when she moved her mouth back over his head and took him completely in.</p> <p>"Your cock feels so good," she moaned. "Fuck. Yeah."</p> <p>He pushed his dick as deep into her as it would go in the first penetration and he quickly pulled out again. She moaned as it had hurt, but she was still so wet that she actually felt like she could actually go again.</p> <p>"Do something," she said. "Get your dick back in me. Do that again. You're going in deeper than you've ever been. Oh, yeah."</p> <p>He quickly turned around so he was laying on top of her as she held him for the most intimate moment of their long relationship. The first time she had her pussy licked by an expert but this time, she was actually on her back while he lay on top of her. She was still on her back and she put her feet up against his butt andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
