The way I see it this way and the way I think it," she said, pulling him down to her. "There is no point in you going back in there, just stay."</p> <p>They looked at each other for a moment, wondering what that last statement meant. Was it a threat or a promise?</p> <p>"Let's go," she smiled. She lifted him to her, wrapped her arms around his waist, and pulled his lips down to hers.</p> <p>"I've been waiting a long time for this," she sighed, then kissed back. She could feel the softness of his lips against hers and moaned a little too loudly. She wasn't sure which kind of moan was more arousing, her arousal, or his. They'd been kissing before. They had gone over the same routine, the same rules to tie the knot, so to speak. And there was something about this time that had a little something to do with where they were already, and which part of their marriage she really trusted, and which part of the relationship she just enjoyed. As she kissed his face and trailed kisses down his throat, both of them began to breath faster as well. He lifted her up, pressing them together so he could slip his tongue between them in a long, languid dance. She wrapped her arms around his neck and ran her fingers through his hair. He wrapped his arms around her waist, and pushed his hands down to her ass so he could cup her cheeks like he had her. The thought gave her yet another surge that she didn't quite know how to control.</p> <p>She felt as if she might go mad. The way she had to go to sleep, she might never sleep again. The thought of them going to bed together, and the thought of him fucking her again, she would have thought he wouldn't get mad. She could feel the blush on her cheeks, that embarrassment, and it made her feel so slutty that she could almost not even think about it. She just held on.</p> <p>"I can't believe I'm doing this," she cried, breaking the kiss. He turned her away from him, and grabbed the waist of her dress with one hand. He tugged it up and over her head, tossing it aside as he started toward her. She was in a daze as she watched him with a blank stare, and she could feel her nipples hardening under her bra as he slipped it off of her. He stood over her as she struggled to get her shoes on.</p> <p>"That's better." he leaned down, kissing her lips softly. "You're beautiful."</p> <p>"Are you just going to sit there staring at me?" she demanded, and he leaned down to kiss her again. It didn't need a command, though. Her knees went weak as he leaned her back in the chair so the back of it was against the wall, and he kissed her again, letting his hands run up and down her legs as he moved over her.</p> <p>"No," he whispered against her lips. "No," he said, pushing the rest of the way down to just above her mound. He couldn't believe how wet she felt. He couldn't believe what they had just done, and in front of him and all those people they'd been watching, they'd just done this. She was almost his to do what he had to do if not for someone who wanted no part with him right there. She was so small. Still, he thought, he wasn't exactly in the position to be an asshole. He kissed her again, this time even slower. His erection rubbed against her as his hand caressed her stomach, running up and down over her breasts and circling her areolas, the tip of his fingers barely grazing the edge while he did his best to keep his lips, his tongue, and his breath steady. His cock was pressing her hips closer; his kisses were so soft that she had a hard time focusing on their kissing. When he finally stopped kissing her lips and ran his tongue across her nipples through the thin fabric of her top, she felt like she'd dropped a stone. She was breathing hard, but didn't think she could manage a full breath.</p> <p>"It's time you get some pants on. You're going to feel so good to me, you'll never see a better place to get rid of that."</p> <p>He reached again for her dress, and pulled it toward her. She struggled to pull it off, to get it over her head. When she didn't seem able to, he stood back up, pulling the fabric over her head again. He reached up and pulled the bra off, then reached one hand down to feel the softness of her tits, squeezing and rubbing one of her nipples.</p> <p>"I told you she has an amazing body, is she teasing you, or trying to draw you into her body?
