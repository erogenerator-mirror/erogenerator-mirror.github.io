I want it on both of our faces first. I thought about it, and I was pretty sure I would be in love this morning. But after yesterday it didn't really matter. We were in it together and fucking like bunnies. I think you're ready." I didn't know how to respond. The thought that I had only moments ago thought, I might have to admit that I was a little excited about our night. It wasn't at all what I had in mind but maybe just right.</p> <p>"But...?" I asked, feeling a bit embarrassed. My wife's face? My head? And what would it hurt this time.</p> <p>"A lot of guys would have gone home, if we... I mean, we both slept in just that night and woke up with the same results. Or they would have wanted to." My wife's face? It was a bit fuzzy, I guessed. But I could see it in her face. She really didn't want the consequences of this, but still would have liked it. What would it matter. She had never done anything like it before, in our marriage bed.</p> <p>"But what if..."</p> <p>"But nothing," my wife interrupted. "We just got caught up, again, in a strange mood, and we have to be sure we're going to keep on doing this." What was I expecting? Could it be all in my head? But what if we had to stop before we made any significant moves? Maybe if I had been really horny and then had stopped, that would've made the decision easier. So I started to laugh a little, and to my joy my wife did the same. I laughed for a bit, and when I was through, I was laughing a little too.</p> <p>"I'm glad I did. That's why I said you'd let me make it up to you." Her face? I wasn't sure how my face looked. It looked sort of sad. But it sure did feel good to be appreciated by her. It was just weird. We had gotten caught up in our silly situation, and the guilt had crept into our thoughts, and then I remembered how much I had wanted to do it. How I had just wanted to do it. And then what would have happened if all this had happened? I felt a wave of sadness wash over me in my mind, the one that was making me dizzy. I tried to think of a way to get my mind back on what would happen, just to keep on going.</p> <p>I took my eyes off her face and looked down at her, who was staring directly at her own face. I got up suddenly, and we quickly got dressed, we walked hand in hand through the door, and as we passed through the living room to their kitchen I realized. "So... you have no idea," I said. "You are a strange sort of beauty. I can't believe the first couple weeks." Maybe I should just admit to the guilt from yesterday, I thought to myself. I was still a bit unsure of it, and now my wife was sitting there looking into my eyes. She was wearing the same robe I was wearing, although I could see she had put on one that was a bit looser, because of this. My eyes were on her thighs, and she let me see her cleavage. She did have a t-shirt on, but I couldn't tell. I think that she might have been wearing a bra under it. And when she started walking again, she was still looking at her own face. They were beautiful. But I realized I had not given her any idea that we were going to make love tonight. This was something else. She was in such a mood yesterday, or perhaps even earlier this evening. After that I could almost imagine she was in love with me. And I am sure she was seeing our "making love" through my eyes, but just couldn't figure out why it was happening right now. And even thinking that was a bit odd, I was kind of wondering if I would get a chance, to get our marriage back on track. Maybe I could have a chance with her. It was going well, so far, maybe she could get out of this kind of situation and make me happy. But I had to tell her I wasn't getting a chance like a friend and girlfriend.</p> <p>In the meantime, she had a beautiful grin. It was almost cute, and it looked happy. She put her hand on my hand to take my ring off.</p> <p>"Oohhh, I need to have that ring. Do you think we should go? I have a lot of plans after. Do you remember I was at work today?"</p> <p>"Yes, the last thing I remember was you. Are your plans going to be good?"</p> <p>"I have to tell you, that you're very pretty.
