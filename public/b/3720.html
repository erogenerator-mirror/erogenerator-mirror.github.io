Kelly said with her eyes glancing from her left foot and to her right, at the clock, "I got the phone call from the guy at the shop. He wants me to deliver the package to your hotel."</p> <p>We all giggled and I couldn't believe that when I turned around to face her, she looked right at me and gave me the same look that she gave me when she realized that I was about to talk to her, "I need you to do me a big favor... call your hotel and tell them that I'm over here so the guys can meet me up at the hotel... and that they'll know you're coming... and that you'll bring along something to wear tomorrow to the place... get your suitcase in the trunk and come see me."</p> <p>I felt her smile and I smiled right back. "What..." she said before I interrupted again.</p> <p>"I need you to pack your stuff for your trip tomorrow... and for the next couple of days... and we'll go home and..."I said before I even finished my sentence.</p> <p>Kelly stood there and with a shocked look on her face, asked me why I was telling her this. I said that I needed something that she wanted, something that I would enjoy sharing with her.</p> <p>"I'm not sure you understand me, "she said with her voice trailing off while she looked around for a long moment, "it seems that since the moment I saw you, I've been looking at you and liking you... It seems that I'm liking the way you look. It seems like you just want to be with me, the way you do, and that way, the way I like. I never realized why that would make me feel so comfortable with you, but it did... and I'm not sure that I wanted you to know that it did not feel as bad as it did before... or any other time... for some time. " she said as if it were her decision and it was, but her eyes were now focused on mine.</p> <p>It wasn't the right time to bring up it, not when I had nothing better to do to this. I had to do this now and then. Right now, there wasn't as much time to talk about it, but now, I had much more to be thinking about. "It's my business, and I need to do exactly what you want... now," she said as if it was her decision, as I began to stand. It was, but she couldn't look at me without wanting to. "You need this car... it's your..." she said as she reached out her hand and began stroking my inner leg. "It's in my business and I would love for you to buy it for me, but not right now... not yet. This has to be private... and you might not like it that much... but you can come up for lunch tomorrow. It's for lunch to go to the club... and a little fun... " Her hand was still around my dick and I wanted that in a little more. "No, no," I replied, "it's my business and I'll have it done... it has to be done, but..."</p> <p>"But what," she asked while still stroking me, "what might you like to do, " she asked with a naughty smile, "and do together..." she teased as she pulled her hand away from my rod and began to stroke it again. "I'll just tell you, I have something to do. I also brought you some hot food. I'm not sure how much you're going to get it if I buy it... but you can bring some, " she said with a naughty grin before she turned and left the room.</p> <p>"I'm all set," I said looking down at the box that contained the hot food. "That's why I called you," I said softly, "because I know you're going to like it and you didn't know about us having it, yet. I'll be a bit surprised if you have a change of clothing and bring something to wear when we arrive."</p> <p>"Oh no, you're never going to forget this," she assured me.</p> <p>We stood there for a moment and Kelly told me all that we should do before we went home. I'm sure she didn't mean to say that, but I wanted to hear more. What we did last few moments before was wonderful... it felt like she was going through the motions of a full grown man. I was trying to think of a way I could do what I just done and that would not ruin it for us. I don't know if she told me that it was time to call her again, but I would have been able to see how great it felt to actually hold her naked body inside mine.</p> <p>I was starting to get a little worried about doing something that couldn'tâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
