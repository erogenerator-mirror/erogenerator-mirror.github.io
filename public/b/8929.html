The walls were lined with junk-built furniture and other than the huge bed, a single bed with two large pillows stood in one corner, the other three stood against one wall and a sofa behind them, a chair was on the floor with seat made for it.</p> <p>"Can they even open the door?" I asked when I heard her say "Sure!"</p> <p>I walked down the hall and stood in front of the door, looking over the door frame.</p> <p>She was standing just outside the door, and she was wearing a bathrobe, and her hair was down and brushed over one of her shoulders. There was lipstick on one of her lips, and she was looking into a cupboard behind me at something.</p> <p>"Do you want us to come in?" she asked.</p> <p>"Sure," I said, and I reached over and opened the door, turning the handle. The door slid open easily, and there, leaning against the doorframe, were six women wearing bathrobes and bath-robes of all sorts. The four of them stood there a moment, in silence, looking at one another.</p> <p>Finally, they all moved forward, moving into the room. "This is the first bedroom I've seen in a while," said Laura, "and I can't believe it!"</p> <p>I stepped inside the door of the second bedroom and saw the room. It was huge. More like my grandparent's than a parent's bedroom.</p> <p>The walls on either side had been painted a deep, dark violet, with very intricate patterning. The bed was made of dark-skinned ivory, with two thick pillows, with a deep, inviting V on the opposite side. On the far wall, on a plain wallboard, was a small shelf, next to the bed, with stacks of photos of relatives and friends in various states of dress, both at home and at school. A large, dark-haired girl was standing naked beside one of the dresses she wore, her back up against the wall, looking up at the ceiling. Her short white hair was a mess, some on one side of her face showed moisture. In the back of the dresser, the dresses were all folded, and there were another dress on another shelf with a pile of photos, all of pictures of Laura, along with photos of herself as her daughter. A large bed was in front of the wall, the photo inside of one was of her, and she was smiling.</p> <p>"Wow," I said to myself. "This is unbelievable." I sat down on the bed across from her, and sat on the edge of her bed.</p> <p>"Here, get a blanket," she said. "It's time for us to get our stuff back here."</p> <p>I didn't know what to say.</p> <p>"Are you sure you're ready?" she asked. "I was hoping that you might want to stay. We were going to spend the night. I don't mind, really. We can just take off the rest of the clothes and head back to the motel, we're all set."</p> <p>"And what about your car?" I asked, knowing that I was.</p> <p>"Don't you worry about it," she said. "We can leave it here, or, we can park it here and be back here within the hour. And you can pick the car up tomorrow."</p> <p>"That sounds great!" I said. I wasn't sure I believed her.</p> <p>She reached for a lighted cigarette and passed it to me. "Here, put this on." Then turning it over, she lit it for me. She took the lighter back and drew one end of the smoke into her mouth. Then, she lit it again, and passed it back to me. After I offered her one, she took the lighter and took a long drag, blowing her smoke into the air, taking little drags. This lasted about a minute and I started to feel a little sorry for myself, but then she looked into the flame and I began to laugh.</p> <p>"What do you do here," she asked me.</p> <p>"I'm always a light smoker."</p> <p>"A little light?" she asked.</p> <p>"No, just an old guy," I said.</p> <p>She chuckled. "Well, get off your bed and come back to the room in the meantime."</p> <p>I nodded and left the room. I went over to the sofa where another pile of photos, along with another stack of photos. I picked up a photo of Laura standing beside her bed - a woman dressed in a dress, which came down to her stomach - and sat down on the sofa and began to leaf through them. "The woman was Laura Fildri." She read the note to her father: "You are now going to be my husband, Mr. Lâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
