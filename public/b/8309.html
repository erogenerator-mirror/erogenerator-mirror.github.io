She continued that she was married too but that I didn't think my wife should marry anyone without checking that I was fucking her. I was still rock hard when my wife told me what she was telling me. She was told by her husband when she was younger that she was not allowed to fuck her own husband. I have never told her why I think her husband should have to know it was so wrong. I knew this was wrong but I was able to stop it. She then told me that when she was younger, she would fuck guys in the same house as her husband if they had the chance. I thought of it and told her that would certainly solve her problem but as long as she didn't get pregnant I didn't see any reason to have sex with her.</p> <p>At some point I looked into her eyes and saw tears. I could have told her that she would have been disgusted with me. However, I had another question to ask her.</p> <p>"What did you tell him when I told him about us," asked Laura.</p> <p>"Well I didn't want him to know then," she replied.</p> <p>"What did you tell him," I continued.</p> <p>"I told him that we've had sex and that's all I mean. He asked me if we ever fucked before and I said yes. Then he told me I'm a bad motherfucker. I told him to forget about me."</p> <p>Again, I could have stopped it and told her that her mother is the best lover that I have ever slept with. However, I didn't.</p> <p>"That's the whole story," I said then.</p> <p>Laura looked at me and said, "I'm sorry. He told me he was not a good lover. I think I've fallen in love with him. God knows I'm not good to have sex with," she was crying now.</p> <p>I was devastated and at a loss. I asked her where we could get married and she just pulled me to her. "I don't think there is any reason you should marry me when I told you you weren't sexy. He has a hard body too and I haven't put on a good show for him."</p> <p>"Oh I should have known!" I cried. "It's nothing like that."</p> <p>We both laughed. "So you're not a very sexy woman," she asked.</p> <p>"No, we both have a good body!" I said.</p> <p>"You're wrong about that," she added as tears started to fall down her cheeks. "I've always been a bit conservative and so am a slut when it comes to sex."</p> <p>"I can live with that. Are you sure you want to go through with it?" I asked now.</p> <p>"I'd never do anything like that," she said. "And I'm not sure how you feel about it." I could feel my face starting to blush.</p> <p>"I told you I'm not sure what to do with that!" I said as my wife started to cry. "I didn't expect you to give me permission to fuck him." I told her.</p> <p>I couldn't believe how right she was. "When you say you were a slut you really mean it!" I said.</p> <p>"Do you think we should be fucking or would you rather do it while him watches?" she asked. She seemed to be in a mood now that the truth was on the table.</p> <p>"Sure." I replied.</p> <p>Again, she got on her back. "I can't believe that he would allow me to fuck him without asking first." She was right. If I were a gentleman and fucked her, I'd say no, but I wouldn't do that. She just told me that she felt like a slut and couldn't wait for him to fuck her instead. I didn't have any reservations as far as the first or second times went nor did I have any reservations about doing all that shit with her. No, I'm not the kind of man that does anything that isn't for his wife. It's just for you I guess."</p> <p>I was beginning to get excited now. I mean, a blowjob was so hot after all and she had her pussy on his face by now. I had to get her off and if she wanted to fuck him there was just a lot more I needed to know.</p> <p>"You know I can't wait," I said. "I need to know if you can get any fucking with that hot bitch of yours but how about you tell me. We are going to have lots of opportunities to fuck." I felt better having her there but my ego had gone a little further than I expected.</p> <p>"As soon as you're ready we can do it," she replied.</p> <p>I agreed and she pulled me to her. She told me thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
