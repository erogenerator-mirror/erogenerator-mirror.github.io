I said and then added, with a little growl, "I want to feel you cum again."</p> <p>"Please." she panted, "Please make me cum!"</p> <p>Grabbing a breast in each hand I squeezed one in my hands as I let go of the other and reached for her right leg and pressed it against my belly. My hips and pelvis moved back and forth as she let out a moan of pure pleasure and relief. My hand moved to the top of my pelvis and I began to fuck her slowly, not really moving in and out. I knew she would feel every part of my body. There was never a point when our sexual playtime was anything but loving and lustful. It was the most intimate and intimate thing a woman can do when being with a man. It was the way she touched me and the way she spoke to me. Those were my greatest and most sensual aspects of my woman – our connection and love for each other. With her hips moving back and forth to match my hard thrusts I knew she could feel the hardness of my cock against her as it slid in and out of her warm wetness, in and out.</p> <p>"Yes!" she moaned as it became harder and harder to control. "Yes!" she cried as her arms spread for me. "Fuck me!"</p> <p>I knew I wasn't going to resist her. I didn't have to. I couldn't. I could give her all I was worth right here - now or some other time. I needed to feel everything about her. I need to feel her as her body and mind became mine. It was her nature to take control and I never wanted to see that end. She was no longer the woman I had loved – and now that she was gone I wanted her so bad.</p> <p>"Yes!" I panted as my fingers clenched and pulled at her tits as I fucked her more deeply and harder with each thrust she made.</p> <p>"Yes!" she cried. "Give it to me!" As she moved my arms around my head I lowered my head away from her and put it around her neck. Holding her body in my hands I thrust my hips back and forth, driving her deeper into me. She moaned louder, more urgently, and we took the same position as we began to build towards a glorious climax. I was so into this that I started to feel faint. She saw in my face the signs she was going to reach.</p> <p>"Cum!" she cried "Cum with me!"</p> <p>I reached up and grabbed the flesh of her shoulders and held on as I thrust faster and faster. I could feel the tremors of her fingers as the pressure on her shoulders became more pronounced. When she said "Cum" her fingers reached my fingers and she wrapped them around my fingers which she then squeezed, making me moan deeply. The tremors built over her fingers and made her body vibrate as she reached for my soul. I knew that the time was young.</p> <p>She whispered, "Fill me up with your seed!" and I did.</p> <p>Her fingers were still wrapped around me as they began to move against my face as the tremors began to intensify. The sounds of her moans increased as the tremors in her body grew longer and more sensitive. I wanted more. I wanted to fill her womb so she could feel my every movement as hers was never the same. I knew if we continued we could make her feel a climax of some kind building inside her cunt. I know her fingers moved from my face. With my fingers I knew her hand was pressing against her face as she breathed in and out in rhythm with our movements. I could tell her body was getting stronger and that her clit had grown even bigger with excitement. I could tell she was beginning to build towards her climax.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum!" she moaned out and I felt her body begin to tremble on top of mine.</p> <p>"Cum with me. Cum with me. Please fill me up!"</p> <p>It came as a complete surprise to hear her talking the way she used to. I wasn't sure I could keep my composure now, but I didn't want to hold back. It wouldn't be long yet before she was finished. She wrapped her arms around me and held me close. Her body was tight and we kissed at the same time. As I kissed her I felt her tongue probe into my mouth. She tasted of coconut. It felt sexy and sensual.</p> <p>I knew she was ready and I wanted to make her feel as good as she always did. I wanted to kiss her body until we were completely dry. I wanted the feel of her wet body on mine for as long as I could stand and wanted every part of—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
