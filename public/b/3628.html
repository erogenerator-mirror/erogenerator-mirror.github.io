She had a small smile and an evil little smirk.</p> <p>She began talking into it again,</p> <p>"You know what to do. I think she is really into it too." Rachel's words were as simple as "Go for it." and "Do it to me."</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I questioned? I thought, "I am sure it is true or can it be a little bit of truth?" I thought.</p> <p>"No, not quite yet. I think I still need time to adjust." Sarah answered that as well, as I could see by her reaction. Rachel smiled slightly as she looked at Sarah and I then back to Sarah who continued talking,</p> <p>"You may not think you know, but I have told you before. There will be some things you may not like, but there will also be some things you will like. I also have thought how to tell you of some things that we have discussed here and about sex and we have already talked about these things, and now we are going to do a little business. Sarah, would you be interested if I went away today?" Sarah's response to that question was simple and simple to deal with. She was still in the same position you might go in when looking for a good person to talk to and for sexual information that someone had. That was what Sarah liked for her and my wife's business.</p> <p>Rachel had already gone to bed. Sarah had finished getting to work. She seemed almost sleepy, but she did not. She had a smile on her face and a slight tingle in her pussy. She still had not finished looking at Sarah.</p> <p>I watched, intrigued. Rachel looked back at me. I was wondering if she had told Sarah. I did not know what she was thinking.</p> <p>She was just getting back into the bath when she looked at me. She smiled then and said,</p> <p>"You know what I am thinking about, so I can think of something."</p> <p>Sarah smiled back, her body shivering. She watched with excitement, as Rachel began thinking. Rachel was not sure she did. She knew now that Rachel would not be happy with Sarah. Sarah had told me that she did not go for that kind of sex. Sarah's sexual orientation would only be part of what Sarah's desires were. But, that was not necessarily all.</p> <p>Rachel said,</p> <p>"Well, I have been thinking about this, how about you?" with that Rachel said yes and we began the business.</p> <p>We went over the things that we had talked about. We discussed some of the things we would like to discuss. We discussed what could be done to Sarah and the sexual things that might be done to Sarah. Rachel came up with something that Sarah probably did not know.</p> <p>She talked a little more. I could see that she was thinking and thinking some more. She was looking at Sarah intently with intense, questioning eyes. She got up a little and said,</p> <p>"Sit down."</p> <p>Rachel then sat down on the edge of the tub and sat back looking at Sarah. She was now looking at me. Rachel's hand came down and ran over her stomach, she went over to Sarah's breasts and gently cupped her breast in her hands. Rachel then moved one thumb onto Sarah's nipple, she touched it and rolled it gently.</p> <p>Rachel's hand came down and found Sarah's pussy. Rachel then began to stroke the outer lips with her finger. Rachel was stroking Sarah's pussy and moving her hand around inside her. Rachel's fingers touched her swollen clit and it was like the moment of release it was. Sarah was now pushing back against Rachel's fingers. Sarah was pushing back the other hand of Rachel and rubbing against Rachel's fingers, the two women were now rubbing together.</p> <p>Rachel had Sarah's legs up over her shoulders and now she was taking the initiative to play with her pussy. Her fingers were going in and out of Sarah's pussy. Sarah was also fingering Rachel. Rachel was moving her thumb on Sarah's clit and she moved it around as she fingered her. I had never felt what my wife was doing to me, or doing to me at first.</p> <p>Rachel watched and then she looked up at me and smiled. She said to me,</p> <p>"Get over here, I want to eat that pussy." She said to me. I got off the floor and walked over to the tub. When I got in, both women were rubbing and kissing each other, while one of them had one hand on the other's breasts, while the other hand was under them fingering her pussy.</p> <p>I sat down on the edge as Rachel brought the other hand up and began licking Sarah at the same time. I watched as Rachel's tits wereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
