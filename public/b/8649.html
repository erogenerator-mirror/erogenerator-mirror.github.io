What do you think of these things?” I asked to get it all out.</p> <p>“Oh, sorry.” Was all that she could say in response.</p> <p>“I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said anything!” I laughed heartily and gave her a kiss on the lips.</p> <p>“Well you should ask!” Was all I heard as she kissed right back.</p> <p>“Is your boyfriend here?” She giggled over my lips with her free hand now, and then slowly, teasingly rubbed my crotch a little. I loved the feeling very much.</p> <p>“Yes... oh yes,”</p> <p>“Good. So what do you think of that dildo and the one with the straps?” She asked me as she rubbed herself up and down on it. “How about you? Have at it, and I think that you get off on it!” I grinned at her and took hold of my cock, stroking it as she rubbed herself while she talked. “I can feel how wet you are. You have a real cock-shaft for a woman!” She asked me once we were both in her booth at the bar.</p> <p>“Oh don’t tease me! It’s real, and it looks very good as well!” I told her as I started pumping myself in and out of her. The heat that was building up again in my groin in that place. “I’m never going to get enough of that!” I smiled.</p> <p>“So do you want one too, after I come?” She asked as she looked at her handiwork.</p> <p>“I’ll be real sure.” I told her. “But I think I’d better get a cab, too.” I suggested to her.</p> <p>She laughed at my comment and reached to the back to retrieve the bottle that she had brought. I watched as she got herself to her feet and picked it up. She stood still once she handed me the bottle, as she went back to the table and picked up the strap that the women had provided earlier. She passed me the bottle. I picked it up and took a good drink.</p> <p>“How do you feel?” I asked.</p> <p>“I’m okay. Your cock has made me so wet and so horny,” she smiled. “I’m so glad these toys have found their way into my panties. I’ve been thinking about that for hours. If we start to get all this going, I’ll have never had a real cock before but now, it feels so good to feel it against my slit!” she said with a laugh.</p> <p>“Good, what do you like better?” I asked me.</p> <p>“I like to put things that I think I would like to have in me, but then leave out the sex part and start something else. The strap-on thing, the one that I had in the other booth with you and then the one you’d let me try the dildo with... you know, while we were fucking each other. That has always been a fantasy that I’ve kept from a man, or woman, because they are so different. One time when we met at the bar, they had the strap-on I’d bought the night before and were having anal sex. It was just the right time for us. I loved it when I put a dildo as hard as the one that I’ve been using on you today and felt that it was just right. I used them both. I liked being held down while you went down on me.”</p> <p>“We’ll get started as soon as you get off!”</p> <p>“It looks like you’re going to get off on having this thing buried deep into you. Have you ever had a real one, before?” I asked her.</p> <p>“I’ve done a lot of stuff like that, but it is so much better than the dildos I use when I’m with you! You can watch me or watch you as you fuck me with my dildo. I like to have a lover, at least to start with before I start fucking you! It makes my sex feel better, to look and not just feel and not just have to do anything for the rest of the night!” She grinned at me for a minute.</p> <p>“Do you like to watch me fuck you?” I asked her.
