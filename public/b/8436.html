I looked up at her, her face showed a knowing smile and she continued, "We have already set up an appointment for the next appointment, and you're just getting started." With that comment, I felt myself blushing in embarrassment. I was going to be the one who walked out of this session without even the slightest hint of a second opinion. "It's not like we're playing strip poker," I said, wondering how the hell I was going to pay the price.</p> <p>"No, it's not. It has nothing to do with any of this, but we've been looking." She was back to her usual sweet demeanour. "Do you want to come?" I nodded, and she led me to the door, my face flushed with embarrassment, but I knew I'd be back in my room in only moments.</p> <p>The next two months went by quickly, and for the first few times, I got a chance at a normal session. I was a good student, as I had hoped for a semester, and my tuition and fees had kept me focused through high school, so it was just too little.</p> <p>A few times, it seemed like I had a real job at the office, doing the same odd jobs as people in the IT departments. This was a big break for me, I had to keep a job in my spare time, and I didn't have enough to afford to pay my bills. On top of that, there were some real estate issues to deal with, and the money coming in was in no way easy to pay. My only saving was the good job reference books I had, and I was able to keep an eye on the market when it was near.</p> <p>The last few months had been uneventful, I managed to buy one of the smaller furniture in my spare apartment building and had everything in place before lunch time. In the last couple of months, I had gotten a start on finishing my degree, but I still wasn't looking forward to my last semester as a single student.</p> <p>When my roommate left town, I hadn't seen her in a few months, and for those few months, I had made a few mental notes about what had happened. This was the first of several months I would visit her on a regular basis, and I was hoping it would be a good place to start to clear my head.</p> <p>On my second visit, I tried to keep it all as far from the point of my personal life as possible. I didn't want to give her any sense of self-pity. I wanted to do something that helped her feel more alive than she had been since I left and had to deal with what she had become.</p> <p>It took her the better part of two hours to answer the door that night, and as soon as the door was closed, I stood in front of her and held out my hand. "Please, I need to see what you're looking for."</p> <p>Her expression changed, and I saw a sudden pang of guilt in her eyes. "That would be fine. I was just about to give you the information you needed."</p> <p>"Let me, I don't think it's necessary, but I can be your first." After a moment I added, "There are others out there that I'd love to help you with such things."</p> <p>"Please, call me Angel." There was a hint of a smile in her tone. Her eyes went back and forth between mine and I could swear that I saw a smile cross her face. I didn't know for sure what it meant, but I decided to play along with her game of one day, and as soon as I did I added, "Please call me Michael, and I won't try to push you into anything you don't want."</p> <p>Before I left, I pulled out two hundred and a half dollars from our pocket and asked, "Well, Angel, what do you think?" When she hesitated for a moment, she saw a little wince on my face and gave a little shrug. "Don't worry. It was only an offer, and I'm sure a young woman like you would be willing to help."</p> <p>When I entered our apartment, she walked over and sat down on the loveseat. "May I start without you?" she asked. It was her turn to shrug, and she gave me a little wave. We sat and she poured a glass of wine for everyone and set her glass on the table between the chairs. After several sips, I asked her, "Are you sure you won't mind a little company?"</p> <p>She smiled at me, and took her glass and started the bottle, then poured two more sips forâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
