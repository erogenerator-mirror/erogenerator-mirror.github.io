Now you know what that means."</p> <p>I leaned over her, pressing my lips to hers in a kiss of love and affection. For several minutes as I watched the passion building between our parted lips, the passion and longing for each other, I lost track of time. Her face was flushed, her hair a tangled matted mess, her body quivering as her arousal mounted.</p> <p>"Oh, God...." she said between her ragged breaths. "What are you going to do with me?"</p> <p>I could hear the urgency in her pleading eyes. I had already determined she had just about blown my mind.</p> <p>"Oh, God! I never knew it could be like that. I always dreamed it would be. I was just afraid you were going to leave me and never take me back."</p> <p>I reached around and cupped one of her breasts in one hand, and slowly lowered myself toward her. For several seconds, I leaned down and softly kissed her lips. Then I pulled her upper body toward me, and our lips parted, our breathing and heartbeat synchronized with each of my movements. As I leaned closer, my lips touched her ear. I slowly licked her ear and then whispered, "I want you."</p> <p>"I'll never want you."</p> <p>"I mean it. I want to kiss you. And I really do."</p> <p>I slipped my arms around her and turned to face my back toward her. My hands slid up and down her arms, feeling for the clasp that held her hair in an elegant pony tail. It was now apparent that I hadn't bothered with it earlier. In a moment, I could feel it and I looked back down. "You really have a wonderful ass, too," I said softly.</p> <p>"If it weren't for my mother's handkerchief, I don't think I would have made a move on her."</p> <p>I kissed her on the nose. "So when am I going to have you? With you." I leaned my head back and pulled her hair back from her ear. Then I turned slightly away from her so I could look her in the eyes. "Is that a problem?"</p> <p>"No, no, no," she answered breathlessly. "You have been so thoughtful. I don't think I'll ever be happier than I am right now."</p> <p>I leaned down and kissed her lightly on the lips. "I'm always here for you. Don't forget. I love you." I turned toward the shower, and turned down the shower faucet. We washed one another, trying to keep our excitement at bay. Finally, we were done. I finished up at the sink and dried myself off, then slipped back into bed beside her. I spooned up behind her and held her.</p> <p>"Sleep well, Baby?"</p> <p>"You know I do," she said sleepily. We kissed, gently at first, and then with more passion. After a minute, we finally separated and cuddled against each other. I held her tight against me. It took a minute for us to drift off to sleep as I drifted off to sleep myself.</p> <p>In the morning, we spent a pleasant hour and a half in bed, caressing, caressing, and talking like old friends, but having never gone any farther than that. We were lying on each other, my arm around her shoulders, her hand snaking up and down my thigh. In the middle of the long week, I knew we might make it to Saturday afternoon. I pulled her toward me, reached under the bed, pulled some blankets over us, then rolled her onto her back, got into the doggie style position and took her with me. She moaned as I entered her slowly and gently. She arched her back. I kissed her nipples first, and then sucked them to make them hard.</p> <p>When she was comfortable with my dick in her, she turned her face up toward me, and our kisses grew more urgent. Suddenly I reached for her nipples. I squeezed and twisted them, and she responded with a little yelp.</p> <p>"Do it to me," she whispered, between kissing me, "give it to me...."</p> <p>In less than a minute, she was rocking back and forth against me. I felt her hand sliding down my body, and her hand cupping my testacles. We heard the splash and she groaned at me, then came for me with a loud yell. I thrust my hips against her once more, and she came again. Once more she was moaning loudly. As she settled down for a second, I continued, then pulled out, slowly, as I wanted to make sure I gave her time toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
