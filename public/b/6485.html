I can barely read her emotions."</p> <p>"Well, in general, as long as it's what she wants, then I support her decision."</p> <p>He looked at me and smiled, "And I support you making some changes in my view of the world. If you want, we have plenty of time to come up with anything else."</p> <p>I grinned, "Well, okay. So tell me and I'll be going now so I'm not wasting any more time."</p> <p>We got all dressed and drove home in silence and he leaned over and kissed me.</p> <p>"Hey there gorgeous!" he said and hugged me back. I gave him a kiss to his lips as his arms tightened around me. We drove home and I drove in silence. When we got home, he smiled, "I'm glad you two got along so well."</p> <p>As I turned to go to the bathroom, I saw him leaning against the wall looking at me. I turned him face down on his bed, reached down and pulled him to me. As I leaned to him, his head rested on my shoulder as I kissed his forehead. I could feel him slowly relax as I moved my lips to his ear.</p> <p>"We really do have to do this. What if your parents don't like it because we did a very shitty thing?" He looked at me strangely.</p> <p>"Do what? This is not a good idea." I kissed his forehead again.</p> <p>"I just don't want them to hate you or hate yourself for it. It's just that I... don't want... I don't want... hate... you and... you know what I mean." I sat up and kissed him gently.</p> <p>"I'm here for you both when you can't do this for yourself any more."</p> <p>To answer his question, I pulled up his nightshirt. "Don't you ever want to?" I teased. He smiled and pulled me in for another kiss. I grabbed his dick and stroked it as he put his hand to the back of my head and thrust his hips up. I smiled up at him, "I'm yours," I said as he pulled my hair back.</p> <p>I kissed down his jaw line and neck to his collarbone, then down his chest to his abdomen. His eyes closed as my lips grazed the skin under his belly button as I knelt on my knees beside him. I kissed lower and lower, my tongue trailing across his stomach as I moved into his underwear. I unbuttoned his pants and pulled them down. His dick popped out with all the confidence left it when he lifted his hips to help me. I looked up into his eyes as my mouth moved toward his. Slowly, he was as hard as ever as I leaned into him and slid his cock straight to my throat. His eyes rolled back with my deep sucking. I let his cock slide out of my mouth before pulling all his underwear off. I looked back at him again, his eyes still closed as I pushed his legs apart. I held his eyes as I moved my mouth down his length to his balls. I had been working on his balls since I pulled them out to get his attention so when I started in on the head, I was rewarded for it by an explosion. His moan let me know he approved of what I was doing to him. As I sucked on his shaft, I felt my nipples becoming erect as my tits pushed my tank top up to my neck. I wrapped a thumb in the waist band of my tank and pulled my tank over it in one swoop. I tossed it aside and stood up to move to the bed with him. He was lying on his back, his eyes still closed. I dropped to my knees and straddled his face as I leaned to the side to pull his cock back to me. I licked the head before taking him back into my mouth.</p> <p>I could tell from the sounds he was making that he'd probably cum soon if I kept this up, so I moved up and straddled him again. His eyes still shut, his cock still in my mouth, his hands pulled my hips down, I held his cock straight up and slowly entered him again. I felt him pressing against my g-spot as I slowly thrust up and down on his dick. I held my breath as he pushed up inside me, my hips moving back and fourth to make sure I slid along my clit. Finally, I stopped.</p> <p>"You okay?" he asked. I could see the fear in his eyes.</p> <p>"Uh... yeah it's just that if I... if you... fuck me so much... I don't know what will happen. I don't want to do anything to stop you."</p> <p>"Yeah. Whatever you want." He sat up and pulled his shirt off.
