Finally, the shaking subsided to a point where a full breath had passed, and a smile spread across her face. She grabbed another handful of her panties, pulled them back into place (I saw them drop to the floor as well, though it was unclear if they would stay there on all four legs at all). She stood up and pulled her underwear and skirt back down, though still holding her panties in her hand, and quickly left the room. While I was trying to recover, I heard the front door open again.</p> <p>"What the fuck?" the woman asked herself. "My husband heard them?" she asked, though still breathing heavily through her nose.</p> <p>The girl returned. "Oh, sorry, I'm sorry. Don't you think they might hear us again?"</p> <p>"I think they heard me just before her." the woman replied, a slight giggle in her voice. "I think we should go now. I think you'll have to wait."</p> <p>"What is he doing?" the woman asked, and suddenly all of my focus was taken up by getting back to work on the girl's shoes. I thought I must have missed them, and then saw the woman open her eyes and look out the livingroom at me and to the right as well, and then back to her shoes. "Oh my Christ!" she said, and suddenly stood up straight and turned around and closed her eyes in pleasure. She sat there, legs apart, grinning like a Cheshire cat grin and arms splayed out, then started walking away. She stopped, paused a moment, then started walking towards the next room. "Oh fuck," she whispered. "I'm still so fucked up. God I can't believe we did that."</p> <p>So, I guess, I'll just stop trying to figure it out here and then, I guess, go home, I'll just come back and have another little beer and check my e-mail, but here we are here and I don't have the energy to do anything.</p> <p>In the next room however, in the hall, it looked to be the main room. The door wasn't closed, but it was slightly one-way, which I didn't realize until I entered the room and saw that it was all dark. So, I knew the room for that was the main room. I went straight to the window opposite, which showed a slightly different sort of window than the one in my bedroom. There was a bed, and there were various parts of the furniture in the area, so there was a large bed, a chair, and a table. Just a couple of chairs, a set of stairs, a couple of small cupboards and so on. The whole place was fairly dark, except when I was looking inside, but I think what really struck me was that it was clearly the end of the hallway, because there was one door, a small one, at the end of the hallway leading into the bathroom. I thought I heard voices, and I was so wrong. There was a guy in the bathroom, one of the first ones I had seen, he must have been getting undressed, and the door was open. The guy in the bathroom could have heard too, as there was another guy in there too, and I couldn't see who had come in, but when I opened one half of the door, the guy had my wife and he was standing naked in the doorway.</p> <p>The two guys that the woman had in her room came through from the bedroom and had been waiting in one of the other rooms, and as soon as they got in I saw that both of them were naked, all hairless, and they were both standing right beside the bed. And then they heard what they thought was their own voices as well, as both of them stood on this end of the bed and laughed at something.</p> <p>At first I was pretty embarrassed, to be frank, a few moments after I came out of it though, being fully aware of what had happened, and that the sight of my wife and the other guy in the situation in that room had been too much for me to bear, so I kept quiet and left it to those two.</p> <p>The other guy saw them and came over to them, and in the next couple of minutes they had stripped naked and were kissing, and were groping and licking.</p> <p>"Oh fuck, I guess we did need to go again," she said, and he was right, I guess, after getting that girl on our bed that first time, but I never said anything and they never said a word about it, other than that their moans and groans got me thinking.</p> <p>"I wish I could go again," he said, and the next thing I heard was my wife saying theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
