He said again and kissed her softly on her mouth.</p> <p>She pulled away and stared at him.</p> <p>"Well, maybe we shouldn't."</p> <p>Her hand went to his and she took his hand and held it at her waist. Her eyes were ablaze with a wild fire. She wanted to touch him and she wanted him too.</p> <p>"Oh, we should, we should."</p> <p>They both knew the rules. The rules were the ones they had heard a thousand times but now knew what they wanted.</p> <p>He stood and he took her in his arms and then he put his tongue in her mouth. They embraced and he felt her body against him. Their mouths met and he kissed her as her hands moved down his back and touched and rubbed his strong buttocks. She squeezed and caressed his buttocks and his penis began to rise.</p> <p>Kira broke away from their kiss and smiled, but she did not say anything. She wanted to make sure that nothing went wrong. She just wanted to make sure that she did not lead them wrong.</p> <p>She stepped back so that he could put his arms around her. He brought her close to him and held her tightly.</p> <p>"Do you like it?" she asked him.</p> <p>"Yes," he said.</p> <p>She leaned over and nuzzled his shoulder. He felt her wet body against his. She could feel him already growing. She put her arms around his neck and she could feel the swell in his chest.</p> <p>"You made me hard." She said.</p> <p>"I do too." He said. He held her ass again and pulled her against it. Her soft skin felt good against his body. He put his hands on her round ass and kneaded her gently. If a man had any idea what his hands had been doing to her for the last thirty hours, and he had none of them, he'd have laughed at her.</p> <p>She was so beautiful! Her long curly hair was covering his lower body and he could feel her soft mounds. She moaned as he kneaded her soft flesh. He squeezed her cheeks and pulled them apart. He held them apart and stared at her gorgeous crack.</p> <p>"Your ass is as beautiful as you look." He told her.</p> <p>What in the whole of this world do I do? Her thought ran through her mind and she didn't know. There is no one in these thoughts except herself. There are only people. And her body and soul were her only self. Why did I go that far?</p> <p>"Is that what you really want?" he asked.</p> <p>Her face was close to his and she kissed him on his lips. He responded and they held each other close. His hands caressed and ran up and down her waist. He pulled off her top and reached around to caress her breasts. She could see his hands rub across her tits and she groaned. She put her arms around his neck and pulled him in for another kiss. Her tongue pushed into his mouth. She liked the taste of him and she loved the feel of his tongue on hers.</p> <p>Their breathing became heavier and she could feel his penis getting harder in his pants. He held her and pulled her against him. Suddenly, Kira broke off the kiss. She felt dizzy as if she were on the edge of an orgasm. But she didn't care about that. She felt him get up and go back to the bed.</p> <p>"Lie down beside me."</p> <p>He was on his back and she knew he would want her on top of him. She kissed his lips again and she kissed all around his face. He moaned as he felt her breath against his skin. She licked every inch of him. She wanted to tease him by touching him like this.</p> <p>"Do you like that?" she asked him sweetly.</p> <p>"Yes." He whispered.</p> <p>She took his penis into her hands and pressed them against his body. For a minute, she teased him with her finger tips. She knew by the way he moaned, that it must mean he wanted her more.</p> <p>Suddenly, Kira had another idea. She pushed her thighs against his face and looked up at him. She kissed him again and again. She kissed and licked all over his face. He was enjoying her caress and it was all turning him on. He had never felt anything like it before. He had never had anyone touch him so gently. It felt heavenly.</p> <p>"What are you doing to me?" he asked. He saw that she had stopped. "No! We shouldn't."</p> <p>"I'm going to, you must stop, please." She pleaded.
