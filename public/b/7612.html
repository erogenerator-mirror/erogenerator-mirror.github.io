She quickly undressed, not caring that she had only just showered and dressed her beautiful body. The sight of her body was enough to wake her from her stupor.</p> <p>She had not even bothered to fix her hair; it fell nearly to the middle of her back in a cascade of wavy black hair that fell down her back. She applied a light make up and was pleased to note that she felt that she looked as good now as she had when she first arrived. She felt completely satisfied; no doubt that she could have had him back on the street any time but still it was too bad.</p> <p>She took another sip of wine and smiled to herself as she finished dressing. It was her first anniversary party and she had been planning to be there for a long time and it was only the three of them. Her friends were all over-booked and she had planned to stay as late as she could, but it felt like a lifetime and all the men there were already wondering what she looked like under whatever she was wearing.</p> <p>As she walked to the living room she suddenly realised that she had no bra and that the feeling she usually got when she wore clothes in public is very different than when she had an accident. Although she was a 34DD, she had never seen a man's member without a bra. She also hoped she would see a cock soon, which was always something she enjoyed. Perhaps now was the time to do something about any embarrassing things she had had, maybe she could find a cock to put on. She walked across the room with her hand on her hip and her eyes locked onto Tim's.</p> <p>He was staring at her; she had never seen him so engrossed but certainly wasn't doing anything around the age of forty. She thought she would try and encourage him a little but as was their ritual this day she didn't know how she could do it. She still had plans with the men but it was time to go back to normal until they asked her again. She wanted him to think it was ok again with the same thing but as part of that she wanted the feel of his cock against her body. It was a little difficult with an erection but she did try.</p> <p>She went to the lounge and sat down again. She didn't think she would need any panties this time. She looked around, there were many other people there but all sat round a low table, so she sat with one leg and one hand on the side so it was just in front of her. There were other men there and she smiled to herself as she remembered that her friend, Sarah, had told her about it. Not a bad looker, she thought and felt as if she could get away with it. Of course, they didn't see anything that would be on the record but they were pretty respectable when it came to her body.</p> <p>She continued on with her wine and found the conversation quite light, talking of the weather or general issues. There was nothing interesting in it since Tim had been away for a week on a business trip so she was looking forward to a bit of conversation with him. She wasn't sure what happened but it seemed they had been through quite a few conversations and the subject of sex had come up again now and then. She found her hand had slipped down to her crotch and she had touched herself as it had earlier in the day and was now stroking the inside of her thigh as she watched them from the other end of the room. She was getting turned on though and could feel that she had to take a sip of her wine before she lost control and began to stroke her pussy through her knickers.</p> <p>She quickly finished her wine and sat back down as she watched them. There was no one here but she couldn't tell if two or three men were being watched by Tim and the thought that he might be interested in her was extremely arousing. The thought of having a strange man in her body made her wet for what seemed like the hundredth time that day.</p> <p>'Hello,' she said, and felt like she had just said, 'Hello.'</p> <p>Tim had followed his eyes down and saw that she had not answered. He looked over at the other end of the table and could see her, legs open, hand on her lap and one leg apart. He looked back at her face and then at the other table and couldn't help staring again. There was something about the look in her eyes that frightened him. It was like the look of someone very scared to be seen with them. He felt a little scared.</p> <p>'Hi,' he replied quickly.</p> <p>'Hi,' she responded, still no answer.</p> <p>'What, how are you?'</p> <p>'No, just here for a moment,' she said.</p> <p>She continued to look around but noâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
