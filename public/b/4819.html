It's okay." Then she slid the dildo slowly and seductively into herself.</p> <p>He pulled himself together, trying to hold himself off of her...and then he couldn't.</p> <p>He leaned forward and kissed her passionately.</p> <p>She pressed him back until he had to lean his lips down and the dildo came out.</p> <p>She quickly turned around and started the thrusting again.</p> <p>This time he was able to hold off from cumming until she was done, so he was done for the night. .</p> <p>Kim began to ride the fake cock, her orgasmic moans getting him worked up as she fucked it harder.</p> <p>Kim began cumming so hard that he felt like he had lost control of himself, for she felt as if she was having his cock up her cunt.</p> <p>They began to kiss again, with a feverish and needful intensity of their tongues meeting in the middle of each thrust.</p> <p>Then he felt her hand begin to rub his cock again...it jerked as she slid her whole body up and down his erection, fucking herself on the dildo.</p> <p>Kim's orgasms just kept coming, until at last she reached her crescendo. As she was still shuddering from her orgasms, he slid his cock up her back, so as not to cum too soon.</p> <p>After she was done cumming, the couple collapsed in a heap on the bed, still entangled in each others arms.</p> <p>When Kim pulled herself out of her panties, she smiled at him. "Is there anything else you want to do?"</p> <p>He smiled back. "Can we go home now?"</p> <p>"You really got that?"</p> <p>"Sure," he replied.</p> <p>"So, you want me to continue doing this as I was doing this to you.?"</p> <p>"Absolutely," she replied. "Do you want a new relationship? With a new partner?"</p> <p>"I'd love to, but I just don't have to fuck my new "friend", that's all. I'm a little too vanilla."</p> <p>Kim had a look on her face that was clearly uncomfortable, as she realized what was coming. So was he.</p> <p>"Well, I'd love for you to do something else if that's what you really want to do. Just let me know."</p> <p>Kim looked at him, hoping he would say yes to what she had to say. "So, I'm still married, aren't I?"</p> <p>"No! That's not what I meant."</p> <p>She didn't even hesitate.</p> <p>"Look, I'm pretty sure you know I'm not a slut by any stretch of the imagination. Maybe you're right and maybe I just need to think about what's going on," she reasoned. "But I did say that I liked it. Now, have fun."</p> <p>With that, they went out to the van and headed homeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
