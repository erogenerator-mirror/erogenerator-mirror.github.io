Peter was breathing hard and still not quite believing what he did, and he looked up to see Kate sitting there with one finger hooked into her pussy, watching him and the orgasm that was still there.</p> <p>"Oh my god that was amazing," he said.</p> <p>Kate was smiling broadly when she saw him look. She reached up and gave his head a gentle kiss, then kissed her way backwards to kiss Peter again. "Goodnight," she said, then walked off, her face still dripping cum.</p> <p>Kate had watched him cum and she looked at him with a naughty grin on her lips as she put her panties back on, but said, "By the way, could you leave us alone for a while? There is a special party going on right up here that I'm not yet invited to. We should probably get going before anyone else comes over!"</p> <p>"Sure, I have to get to work before that," he said, with a puzzled look on his face.</p> <p>"Don't worry, we will be over," she said, putting her panties back on (they were still damp from their first orgasm) and straightening up.</p> <p>Kate had been looking out of the window as she had left Peter with a silly grin on her face when she'd caught his eye, but now all she had to do was go out there and do the same and he would be there soon, too. "Mmm, that was so sexy," she said with a sexy grin as she closed the door behind her. "I can't wait to see what other things you have hidden up here," she added.</p> <p>In the meanwhile, in the bathroom, Kate made her way back to the bedroom. She was still naked, and sat down on a chair at the computer. She was also naked, but she still had her legs crossed, with one hand on her breasts, but she was also leaning back in her chair.</p> <p>She opened up her dresser and took out a vibrator (still covered in her lingerie) then walked over to the bed and sat down beside Peter.</p> <p>"Oh, Peter. You aren't just going to fuck me, are you?" she asked, looking at him with a sexy smile on her face, with both her hands already playing with her breasts.</p> <p>"No. I've waited so long for this," he said.</p> <p>"Are you ready to be fucked?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes, I am," he replied with a wicked grin on his face.</p> <p>"Good. You have been so good to me," she said. "I was so happy when I picked you up for the afternoon. I had no idea you were such a sweet man. Can I please take you into the bathroom?" she asked, already knowing the answer.</p> <p>"Of course you can. I'm ready."</p> <p>"You're sure? I mean, my pussy is so wet for you. I really needed to cum."</p> <p>"I know, Kate. It won't take much for you to get into the bed with me," he said in a sly tone.</p> <p>Kate smiled coyly and leaned back, turning her body so that her breasts were now exposed.</p> <p>"Okay so do it!"</p> <p>Peter sat down in the chair beside his wife, his body glistening from the evening's activity.</p> <p>"How about this?" he said with a sly grin on his face.</p> <p>"Why so sexy," asked Kate, leaning forward to kiss Peter.</p> <p>"I love the way you look when you're about to cum," he said with a naughty yet sweet voice.</p> <p>"I love that I'm going to feel good with a hard cock up my pussy," Kate said.</p> <p>"Good," Peter said. "I've got my cock up you right now, so now we need to get going."</p> <p>"Can you hold off on cumming?" Kate asked.</p> <p>"Oh, I won't," he said.</p> <p>Kate smiled at him as she let her hand go on her breasts, and then sat forward, her nipples dragging across his skin.</p> <p>"You ready to have a nice slow fuck?" she asked with a sweet smileâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
