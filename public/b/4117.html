I said quietly.</p> <p>"No, I don't want to talk about that. . . Well, I . . . I don't want to be by, but . . . I'd like to meet you."</p> <p>"It's good to meet you, and no, I don't mean to be by. . ."</p> <p>And he looked at me with his eyes full of confusion and his mind full of thoughts, not just feelings. He didn't think he saw me in his mind. "You look familiar . . . I mean, you should look. . ."</p> <p>"I'm so confused . . . but I can tell. . ." I turned away. I couldn't meet his eyes like that, but I turned back and looked at him.</p> <p>Then his eyes turned into a different kind of confusion and he started to say something else.</p> <p>"It's nothing. . ."</p> <p>"It looks like the other guy," I pointed.</p> <p>He got that look on his face again. "I'm . . . not sure what to say. . . "</p> <p>"I'll go talk to him. . . Then."</p> <p>"Do you want me to take you home, and watch you go out,"?</p> <p>That had to be it. The reason was obvious, and that's what I said. It didn't register on anyone else.</p> <p>"No thanks, I'd really like to talk. . ." He looked scared.</p> <p>"Please go. . . "</p> <p>I could see his anxiety mounting now. His face was starting to flush and then he was just avoiding me as he walked to mine that confused look in his eyes.</p> <p>When I finally got home, it was easy. I went straight to my room and got ready to talk. There was no turning back now. I undressed and then climbed into bed with him. He was still in the same room with me in the spoon, but I didn't press too hard. I lay there spooning him and enjoying the feeling again. I felt a little guilty the way he didn't have any idea of how I felt about him. I'd been feeling that same sort of guilty.</p> <p>But it was a feeling we could share, too. I could still tell his emotions to him or him to me, because he didn't feel me feeling him, but they felt me in him, too. I didn't want him to say anything to me about us, but he could tell I needed to hear it from him, so I couldn't say anything about it, either.</p> <p>We laid there in each others arms in my bed, in that spoon, with his arm over me, cuddling a little and thinking. It wasn't awkward to lie like that, like a little girl. I think I probably should have told you that I felt a little guilty for him, the way I looked, at a party, while he watched us from across the room. But the way you looked at us . . . When I had him in that way . . . when I'd felt his heart pounding . . . . well, maybe I started to feel something in me. My body reacted when he was looking at me, my heart wasn't really racing. I needed to ask what I feel about him. Why we were the same, even in our fantasies . . . But I knew you wanted to sleep with him. . . . You told me you felt the same things I did . . ."</p> <p>I started to get this little girl all hot and bothered again. I couldn't say that I felt some sort of attraction towards him for the first time. You could have heard me. I think my voice was a little louder. "I wanted to kiss you and run my hands over you in that way."</p> <p>"I can't believe you. . . you didn't even know you felt that way," he said.</p> <p>"It's different now," I said, as if it was obvious I could say so.</p> <p>"I know. . . It's not that it's wrong, but it's weird, right?"</p> <p>"Well, yes," I said.</p> <p>"No," he said. "I mean, just when I'm thinking about you. . . Just when I think about you, and, well, it's not really weird, right?"</p> <p>"Well, yes . . . It's kind of like when you're thinking about other girls, too."</p> <p>"And me?" he asked.</p> <p>"Just like that." I leaned towards him and kissed his lips. He leaned back a little and I kissed him again.</p> <p>"Maybe I think about us the same way, but . ."
