I just don't want to leave it at that."</p> <p>"Don't worry. I'll think about it." she whispered as she broke from our hug and walked away.</p> <p>"Good luck, you two!" She called to us both as we walked up to the bus stop.</p> <p>As I walked up I saw her at the bus stop, still trying to keep her mind focused on me. I shook my head, wondering if it had been that much of a turn on for her too. Of all the things I've fantasized about her I've never seen her sexually excited before. It was so much more than just a fantasy.</p> <p>I had to wonder if she had done this before and maybe it's just going to work out for the both of us. I didn't really know what to make of what she was doing, I'm not a big fan of the exhibition or the fantasy aspect of being naked in public.</p> <p>I didn't know much about being nude and how much of a turn on being naked in front of people. Just sitting and waiting for them to find them, not letting anyone touch me unless I wanted. But every time I saw someone I'd get a hardon from standing at the bus stop. And every time I was coming out of the bathroom I would have to take my cock out to rub myself for them! And I couldn't really tell if it was really happening but I always felt like I was making myself hard.</p> <p>And every couple of weeks I'd be just as nervous as she had been in that bus stop.</p> <p>"This looks like it's going to be a hot one!" I said to myself as I picked up my pace. I had no idea how long she was going to be in front of me. Once we got to the bus stop I got down on my knees and started my "pincher" approach towards her.</p> <p>"So what do you think?"</p> <p>My eyes were on hers. As if she already was thinking it was all right with me.</p> <p>"I think you're right." I said while staring down her cleavages.</p> <p>I looked her in the eyes as I pulled the zipper down on her jeans. She was wearing a pair of pink panties and I couldn't help but get a huge grin on my face when I saw the crotch of her panties.</p> <p>I started taking off her jeans as I tried to get my mouth to hers. But the feel of her skin was as good as anything I've ever felt in my life.</p> <p>"You better go find your panties!" I said to her as I dropped my shorts to the ground.</p> <p>"Yeah. I need to get them now." She said as she looked around, then bent at the waist as the waistband of her panties slid down her legs. Her panties were thin and black and the sight of them drove me crazy that I had this affect on her.</p> <p>"You look like you could use a swim." I said as I pulled her to the end of the bus where she stood.</p> <p>"I like the feeling of being naked." she said as her arms slipped around my neck.</p> <p>"Yeah. It feels nice when I touch you. I can tell what works at the same time." I said as I led her towards the water.</p> <p>When we got out of the water and dried off I had to tell her about it.</p> <p>"I think he's having a good time." she said as she pulled her panties back on.</p> <p>"I can tell. It just reminds me that he got us a little gift." I said as we got back into the cab.</p> <p>"Does it work like this for you?" she said as we got into the cab.</p> <p>"Yeah, kinda. It just makes me think that." I said as I leaned over and gave her a kiss.</p> <p>As I was kissing her I couldn't help but notice the hardness growing in my pants. She could feel it too. But again what made it worse was she knew it too.</p> <p>"Oh, don't tease me." she said as she reached down to stroke my now fully erect cock, causing it to jump once again.</p> <p>"Yeah, that's the idea." I said when we got to our apartment building.</p> <p>She was standing there watching me as I walked around the building. She watched as I went upstairs to our bedroom as I opened the door and sat on our bed. It looked like a room full of furniture.
