He laughed with me, "Well, if I could find her another way, I would be happy to show she's a good girl." My mother smiled, "I know she would've been able to stop you being in here, if it didn't have been for her sister." I laughed softly, "Well, what did you get me?" He shook his head, "Well, it's been a month since we last saw each other, so I thought we might go to town for a little shopping and see what the locals had in stores." He winked at me, "She's been telling me about you two the whole time we've been staying here!"</p> <p>I smiled and took the chance to sneak a kiss, "Well... that's good news..." I tried joking off him, "I mean, there wouldn't the start if she'd caught us fooling around all over the place, even if it was just a small town!" He stood and pulled out a wad's cash from his wallet, "Here, this is nice, I couldn't help myself."</p> <p>He handed me a roll of money, "I was wondering, if the townspeople knew we were seeing each other in a car, they might think we'd been alone." He laughed, "Well, I guess if you didn't want my mother caught in town, the best thing would have been to let you have a little of your fun!" I smiled and handed him two more wads, "Oh, and one thing, if you ever need a reason to stop by the diner, just let me know. It's only a few blocks away, I'd rather that we could just stop in and have a couple drinks there, if you like."</p> <p>He looked shocked for a second, "That sounds like a good idea, I'd really like to have a drink with you!"</p> <p>I laughed, "You want to get a bit drunk, and maybe get a little tipsy?" He agreed and we walked back to his car. "I think you need to get another one of these." He looked up at me, "Oh, you know, this is my favorite, no!"</p> <p>His eyes lit up again, "Yeah, and it's your favorite too!" We laughed at the way he said the word "teaty" so perfectly! I couldn't help but agree, "Thank you, I think! I'm going to make you an offer, that's an offer I'll gladly accept!" He put the car back in gear and pulled away from the curb, turning the car to go back into the night.</p> <p>"You're so sweet!" I laughed. We laughed as he drove away into the night. I couldn't help but notice that his car was parked on a side street that only had houses on it. It had a sign that read, 'It's a private road for married couples'. I smiled to myself and turned the car around, heading back to town, we'd just be stopping back to pick up the groceries and some stuff that we might need laterâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
