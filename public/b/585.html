I said. She giggled.</p> <p>"I like having a guy get excited," she said.</p> <p>She went on to explain the problem being it was a good thing she wasn't getting pregnant and I was really starting to like her.</p> <p>"I always thought that a girl has to do what she's told to do." She said with that same sweet and caring tone of voice.</p> <p>"Mari, come on, you're still young," I said trying to lighten the mood.</p> <p>"No, I'm not that old, you know that," she said. "Now come on. Let's do it."</p> <p>She pulled me by the hand and up the path to the edge of the lake. She put her mouth next to my ear as we walked in front of the boat.</p> <p>"Let's get ready," she said.</p> <p>I followed her instructions and the boat landed in a nice cove in the middle of the beach. The boat was quiet as it took off for a little while before rolling to the left and headed downstream. It was almost dark when we made it onto the road. She had me turn a corner as we got out and she grabbed my hand pulling me toward the center of the road.</p> <p>"Hush," she said as she pulled me down until I was on the front edge of the seat.</p> <p>We made a beeline for the park on the way off and her hand was guiding me along as we rode around. She was standing beside the wheel with her leg draped across mine leaning forward.</p> <p>"I'm hungry," I said.</p> <p>"Not really, you?" she giggled as she grabbed my arm and pulled me toward the center of town.</p> <p>"I'm not that hungry so I'll take you to something nice," I said smiling.</p> <p>"No, definitely not," she said. "But I did say we should try something."</p> <p>"I don't want to but I think it's okay." I said with a smile.</p> <p>She giggled again and walked around the car on the sidewalk, then came around it. She stood beside my seat as she slid into the drivers seat. We just sat there for awhile, listening to the waves, her hands caressing my legs and feet.</p> <p>"This is nice," I said as she looked out of the windshield.</p> <p>"I know," she said. "I love making it feel so good."</p> <p>"And if I was wearing any sort of makeup," I said grinning.</p> <p>She pulled my face close as our lips locked in a passionate kiss. This was the kiss of two lovers lost in the sensuous moment. I slid my hands up each leg and began feeling the smooth skin of her thigh. She pressed forward, almost putting her foot through mine.</p> <p>"We're here," she said as we broke our kiss.</p> <p>"How far do you think it will be?" she said as she looked out of the windshield.</p> <p>"I don't know." I said. "I don't know. I've been out here every day of the month."</p> <p>"We shouldn't be doing this anyway," she said. "We should be more comfortable on the beach."</p> <p>"But we're both naked, and it's nice not to have to carry the bag around all day." I said.</p> <p>"I like it that you're naked," she said looking out of the windshield.</p> <p>"I love your hair and your eyes," I said as I reached up and slowly closed her hair.</p> <p>"Your lips are so warm and soft and sweet," she said as she leaned her head down to kiss me and then let my hands drift upward.</p> <p>I felt one of her hands at my chest and then the other holding mine as we started to slowly separate. We continued like this while we kissed and I started undoing the buttons on her blouse. Soon we were both naked standing in her bedroom with her back to me.</p> <p>"Take me," she said as she leaned toward me, her face only inches away from mine.</p> <p>We kissed and I felt her hand slip beneath mine. Then my other hand found her breast and as I felt her begin to rub her nipple I slid down lower.</p> <p>I felt her hand slide along the bulge in my shorts and knew that she was anxious for me to take her.</p> <p>"I love this," I said smiling. "Your breasts feel so nice."</p> <p>"Mmhmm." She said with a breathy sigh. "It makes me so hot."</p> <p>I slipped my fingers up into the softness of her panties to feel her wet slit. I slid my fingers over her lips and then slid them in her and heard her moan. I looked over her shoulder at her and saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
