It had started to fade into a golden color and the sky was starting to clear.</p> <p>"That's why I brought the dildo in the first date" I thought to myself.</p> <p>"It's not so bad after all, isn't it?" I asked as I began to drift off to sleep, the sun setting behind me.</p> <p>As I drifted off from the events of the last 24 hours I began to remember more about the evening. I had been a little scared. I had felt a little apprehensive, like an anxious teen child. Then, I remembered something else: I had felt a thrill of excitement when Carl and he had shared me with him. I was still so ashamed of what had happened, and now I was a slut looking down at the dildo, and felt like I should be ashamed.</p> <p>I remember thinking that if we should have done this, I should have done it to myself because it was so hot in the car. I was afraid to let my feelings out, or to start acting like a slut. But I trusted Carl.</p> <p>Now I was sitting there looking at the sky, as if I was about to call his mother, or let her in, or something so disgusting, the fantasy became more and more realistic.</p> <p>I reached down and began moving the straps of the dildo down, as I pulled it up my legs and then the sheet over me. The dildo slowly came up, and then it slowly began to slip down my belly. I pulled the sheet over me and then pulled it back up a bit. It slid down my legs and off my feet, and then my right thigh. As the sheet got lower and lower and was laying over the top of my foot I turned and saw Carl, smiling up at me with a big smile, his eyes sparkling and his face contorted.</p> <p>"Looks like I did something right," Carl said to me, smiling down at me with that same big smile, as if he was teasing his own mother. But I felt more wicked, maybe even dirty. I felt a thrill of wickedness, excitement, feeling like I had been caught in some sort of sin, even being caught in such a wicked act. I felt more empowered by feeling so wickedly wicked, and by the fact that it seemed so right, somehow.</p> <p>"Are you all right?" Carl asked me, standing up beside me and staring at me.</p> <p>"I...I should not have...that..." I started, stammering a bit, "just thinking..."</p> <p>"That's OK, isn't it you slut?" Carl said as he stroked my face and arms, giving me just a bit of a smirk.</p> <p>Carl got a warm feel around my face, and then he touched my mouth. I began to kiss him, as if it were the first time I had kissed him. After several seconds Carl removed himself from my mouth, as he reached up and gently caressed my cheeks and nose, making me moan softly under his fingertips.</p> <p>"It turns me on a little," Carl spoke up with as he leaned down and took my left nipple in his mouth, licking it gently, making me moan, as he began to suck my other nipple. It was as if his sucking motion was trying to make me feel the heat and the pleasure and pain of the touch, of him sucking on my nipple as he pleasured me.</p> <p>"Ohhh," I moaned again as he moved to the right one, sucking the other one. I felt the heat of my desire rising up into one of my desires. It was so naughty, so nasty, and so wrong. I was so naughty and so depraved.</p> <p>"You are a naughty, wicked slut" Carl said, kissing me, as I felt the dildo slip down my tummy, past my navel, and then slip over the top of my pussy. I felt the tip disappear into me, as Carl moved down between my legs, as if to say "Let's go get some food."</p> <p>He slid on his pants and shoes, and as I moved around the bed we took the towel and the dildo bag out, and began moving it back and forth over my body. Each time the dildo slid in, the warmth and the moistness, both good and bad, and good with Carl getting me wet, as my arousal grew. When Carl and I were all the way into the bed I pulled my dress down, and he pulled his shirt over his head in a very seductive act, that he obviously loved doing.
