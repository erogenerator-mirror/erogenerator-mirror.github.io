I stood behind her, caressing her tits and the side of her hips softly. I slowly lowered the robe to uncover her pussy, but she stopped me.</p> <p>She reached down and caressed my cock again, squeezing it through the fabric of my shorts. I stepped back, admiring her work. "God he hard!" she smiled to herself.</p> <p>I went back to her until we were face to face. I slipped one hand into the band of her bikini top, feeling her bare tits and pussy. I ran my fingers over her nipples making them hard. I looked her in the eye, "You want it?"</p> <p>She smiled at me, "I want it very much. But you're not really allowed."</p> <p>"No. I want you."</p> <p>She stepped back. I slipped my swim suit back on, and waited for her to get dressed. We exchanged the towel, she hung it and folded it. I walked her to the bathroom and took a shower myself. I went back out to the patio door and we could see that our neighbor was gone.</p> <p>She emerged a moment later. She was wearing a very sexy yellow sundress I'd worn the night before. When she saw me, she smiled, "You're not allowed to come in with us."</p> <p>"That's the spirit."</p> <p>We got back to the deck early enough to have a drink before joining the group. We sat with the others in the warm tub, and she and I sat next to each other on the seat. I didn't want her to see my hard-on.</p> <p>We talked about several things, I was really intrigued by her sexual experience. It's not that we were having sex, but this was a normal thing for two people to have. I had no idea how far her body would go.</p> <p>As her drink arrived, she drank some of mine and asked, "Does your dick go that far?"</p> <p>"It depends on who you ask. When a woman looks back at the camera, she realizes she wanted it to happen. She can't explain how it made her feel. So far it was making her feel wonderful." I was hoping she didn't want to talk about sex with another man. It was probably embarrassing to be seen this way by her husband.</p> <p>"I could understand how you feel. I know you are married and you would never let another man see or touch you. I have no objection if you want someone to fuck you but when you're alone in a hotel alone, you're free.</p> <p>She looked a little pensive. "I don't like to talk about it."</p> <p>"I can't stop hearing the stories people tell about what happens when you are alone."</p> <p>The rest of dinner conversation was as mundane as it had ever been. Her husband was going through his morning routine with another man. By eight o'clock we were all sitting around the table, and my cock was straining against the tight material of my shorts. I'm sure she could see the outline of it.</p> <p>We had another drink at our table, and she began to relax. She was sitting more than an hour away from the party, she's no longer able to sit still and relax as my cock strained against my shorts. I don't think she consciously knew how much I was looking at her.</p> <p>Once we had finished dinner and were both feeling very good, my cock was a little harder than it had been earlier. She moved up beside me, and took my hand. "Let me give you your birthday present." She whispered into my ear.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Do you like the sex with someone special?"</p> <p>"I like it. I really like the idea of a lover."</p> <p>She leaned up, her breasts barely covered by the yellow sundress. "Do you have a girlfriend?"</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>She smiled at her husband while looking around the room, but looking back at me, "Does he kiss now?"</p> <p>I didn't answer.</p> <p>"Do you want to see another man's penis?"</p> <p>My eyes went wide. "I don't know." Was my answer.</p> <p>"No. I think you do." She gave me the finger and pushed herself closer to me in the same way I had with her husband earlier. "I think I think you want this to happen."</p> <p>"No. Please. I'm ready."</p> <p>She took my hand, pushed it to her pussy, sliding it back and forth against her clit.</p> <p>"No. I'm not comfortable seeing another man's penis."</p> <p>She moved up on the seat more, spreading her legs wider.
