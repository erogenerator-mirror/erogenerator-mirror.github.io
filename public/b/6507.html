The panties were tight which hid all my pussy in plain sight. The only thing that made it look that much worse was when someone could clearly see my ass crack. I had never really been shy but knew how to make a girl's heart ache and I was beginning to enjoy being a slut for the next few decades. With my heels on the bed I knelt between the legs of this gorgeous older woman. She looked so sexy, her long black hair was pulled to the side of her, she seemed unaware of my state of dress, or lack thereof. I slipped my left shoe off as gracefully as I could, as I knew she would not be able to get it off easily.</p> <p>I knelt down just below the knee, and then slowly lifted her up onto the bed. She lifted her legs so that they were wide apart, her arms were crossed over her breasts, and her head hung down in shame.</p> <p>"Oh my god."</p> <p>"What's wrong?"</p> <p>"I'm a slut, I'm a slut."</p> <p>'My cock is aching. I wanted to touch myself but I was too ashamed to do what I want, do what I want."</p> <p>The words made me feel more aroused than I had before, a feeling the likes of which I had never felt before. I lowered my head onto the bed next to her, my hand reaching for my left knee, tracing my fingers up to her thighs. She was wearing stockings, a garter belt with a black seam, just above her knees. I didn't dare look at her face; I just wanted to do what the older woman wanted. I moved my mouth up her thigh and over her mound, licking and kissing the lips, moving up to her mouth and placing a soft kiss there. Then I licked down her neck and found her breasts, first one nipple then the other. I licked and sucked and gently bit her breasts, alternating between them. This only made her moan, which only made the pleasure that much more intense, and she responded to my lips and tongue by letting out little whines of pleasure. I moved my mouth lower, kissing her naval, pushing my nose in the hair as I moved. Again I kissed it, my tongue barely touching her. She tried to pull away, but I was too strong. I kissed and licked her stomach, moving my kisses to the next area. She shuddered, but her arms remained clasped above her breasts, and I didn't give her time to struggle. I moved down to her stomach, moving slowly and gently. She had a slight belly of her own, and the way I was feeling she looked spectacular to me. She lifted one leg up so that I had an unobstructed view of her sex.</p> <p>I moved my face from her pelvis down and up again, moving slowly, my tongue barely touching her pussy lips now. She was soaked through and I couldn't believe how aroused she was. I slid my tongue up her lips, flicking it over her clit. The little nub appeared swollen and bright. I ran my tongue around it, up and down and the other end of it, and moved around and around again, occasionally sticking it in her mouth so she could suck on it. She was breathing heavily and I moved my mouth in an upward motion, sucking the very tip of her clit. Suddenly she broke her own hold and held herself up. I continued to tongue her pussy until a few minutes after she was done.</p> <p>"Oh my god."</p> <p>Her voice was breathless, and yet she sounded more like a woman that had just come. I smiled at her, and moved up so I could sit next to her on the bed. She kissed me, her eyes wide, and she whispered.</p> <p>"Do you think there is someone else in the store?"</p> <p>Her voice had sent her arousal in high gear, and it made me very aroused.</p> <p>"Definitely."</p> <p>I turned my face up to hers and kissed her softly, then quickly moved my head back onto the pillows. She pulled my head back towards her and kissed me again. She wanted to be in charge, and she made no move to leave me alone. I lay back as she stood over me, her legs spread wide. Her hands reached for her sex, spreading herself open.</p> <p>"Now, I know what you really mean when you say that you want to be a slut."</p> <p>She reached for a dildo that had been lying on the floor. She bent down and licked the tip, making circles around it. I could feel the heat radiate through the dildo and it almost burned my mouth. I wasn't sure how she meant, but she just continued to lickâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
