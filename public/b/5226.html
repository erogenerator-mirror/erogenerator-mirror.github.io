He looked up, a smile on his face, and saw Kalyndra standing over him.</p> <p>He was about to tell her the good news when she stood him up sharply. "I thought you needed to eat," she said. "Let's see what those plates on the wall say, now."</p> <p>She pulled a plate from under a coffee table and laid it beside him. The meal was delicious with plenty of small cut outs and bread. "Here let me show you, my dear," the girl said, taking his hand and leading him to the study.</p> <p>The door behind him was heavy, and there were piles of books stacked up in the middle of the room. Kalyndra picked up the first one and looked up. A boy was sitting in a chair in front of him.</p> <p>"What the hell are you doing with him?"</p> <p>A small smile creased Kalyndra's face as she took a seat on his lap and pulled him to her. The boy had already begun, and he gave her an odd look as she sucked his tongue into her mouth, then leaned back to give him access to her breasts. She smiled at him, then pushed him away. "What is it, baby?" she asked. "I have a headache."</p> <p>"That seems pretty bad to me," the boy replied. "I think I'm done. Come, have a shower, and we'll talk about what you're sorry for, okay?"</p> <p>Kalyndra was a little surprised by his tone of voice. Her body was all tingly. He had already put her to work before she had the chance. In her own body. She liked him and she didn't like that her husband was the cause. "Okay," she said, and stood, walking quickly to the bathroom, closing and locking the door behind her. When she returned, his face was flushed and his eyes glowered. His chest was heaving and tears had begun to form in his eyes. "You have been so beautiful," he said hoarsely.</p> <p>"I know," Kalyndra replied, still standing. "In truth, I would never have thought of wanting to be beautiful in the same way."</p> <p>"Well, look, sweetheart, I'm so glad you're here with me. It's a little strange for me not to have a sister."</p> <p>He frowned. "I'm not getting on with her. How strange is that?" Kalyndra sat down on the toilet lid, and wiped her hand across her eyes, trying not to laugh or squirm.</p> <p>"That's not what I meant. I don't want to see you."</p> <p>"And what about her, then?"</p> <p>"She's gone."</p> <p>"But that's not possible."</p> <p>A strange voice inside his head caught his attention, and pulled at it in earnest. "How do you know?"</p> <p>"Because I was in her room before you got there."</p> <p>"It was so easy to convince her to let you fuck her."</p> <p>"No, I just wanted to convince her. To get to know her intimately. To know that she's special.</p> <p>"You got the wrong idea there."</p> <p>Kalyndra looked up at him with red eyes that were wide. She took his hand and placed it over her breast. "I'm sorry."</p> <p>"I get the feeling that you enjoyed it, though," he said. "Let's see if you can get me off again, and I'll show you how to do it, okay?"</p> <p>Kalyndra grinned at that and ran her hands over his face, turning his mouth toward her. She pushed her mouth onto his and kissed him with passion, her tongue probing his mouth.</p> <p>She reached between them and began to stroke him. After a few teasing minutes, she pushed him back into the chair and climbed up on him, straddling the boy and beginning to ride him. After a few moments, she stopped and sat looking at him. "I've never done it this way before."</p> <p>"Let's try it some time, shall we?"</p> <p>When he began sliding into her, she pulled herself downward, and started to bounce gently. "I want to try it now."</p> <p>"I'd love to."</p> <p>She stood up, letting her skirt fall, then sat on the boy's lap, then reached behind herself, undoing the garters and pulling on the top. "You ready to go again?"</p> <p>Asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
