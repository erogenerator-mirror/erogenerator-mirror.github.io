Her body seemed to be turned upside down in some sort of pain or shock, but she felt none of it. There was a strange calm about the air, and something about a storm that had passed over their location, and someone had gone into a nearby wood. The room seemed to shake more and more as she struggled against her bonds. The sound of the footsteps faded out into the distance, but a minute later they entered her room.</p> <p>The sound of the footsteps stopped, she heard the familiar rhythmic creaking. She was certain that it had become the sound of a door closing behind them. She wondered how long it would take for someone else to enter into that room, and then she found out.</p> <p>It was two men, one of them was wearing a leather vest he had been wearing. They entered the room, closing the front door behind them. He approached her, and she felt the familiar heat. She couldn't identify the man, but there were some things that she did recognize that they had to be the same men from where she was. He had the look of an older gentleman, tall and well-built. The look of a predator, his eyes intense.</p> <p>"Excuse me," he said in a gravely low voice that she could barely see, but he sounded angry, even angry as he stared into her eyes. "I saw some movement in the shadows there!" He said this as if it was not unusual. He didn't seem angry, just hurt he said it like it was more of an accusation.</p> <p>"Who did that?!" she exclaimed, horrified.</p> <p>"It's not what you're thinking, is it. I know who does it, but I am not sure at this time whether you're fully aware of who did that." He took one of her wrists in one hand, and the other in her other, holding her at bay. "My name is Michael, and I do believe you have the sense enough to trust me," he said, his voice more assertive. He began to lead her toward the center of the room, and as they reached the far edge of the room he stopped, turned, and picked her up by the waist and spun her around. She tried to escape, but he held her at arms length.</p> <p>"Do you understand now, slave?" he asked with a hard stare. "You are to be removed from this room, and if you do not obey, I will take your virginity. If you do this again, I will force you to come and live with me again. Do you understand, slave?"</p> <p>"Yes sir," she managed to say between nervous tears. She was trembling with fear and shame but she could not see how it could be any more humiliating than being forced to take an unknown man's penis into her mouth and throat.</p> <p>"As you are now," he said, "I intend to keep you. But, unless you do exactly this and take me, I expect you to be the property of a man. Is that clear?"</p> <p>He bent her over a table, and pulled the short, thin dress from her body. She heard him undo his belt as he slid down his pants and shorts, and she wondered what he might do, whether to touch herself or what. She felt a throb in her breasts, and she felt hot on the inside and knew that moisture between her legs was gathering from her loins. Michael had never been this harsh toward her before, and she wondered why the pain had seemed so arousing now. He stepped to one side, and she felt him unbutton his shirt as he stood there, his back toward hers. He unzipped his pants quickly, and as he began to take his clothes off, she almost had to take a step back to avoid being thrown from the table.</p> <p>She felt her arms get a warm, soft, velvety feeling in her body as she felt his breath on her neck, and she tensed up, realizing that she was not wearing a belt. "Don't you dare try to escape, slave," he warned her, his hands reaching above her head. "You will be punished for your misbehavior."</p> <p>"Don't I deserve a spanking now?" she asked timidly as he began to stroke his hard erection between her legs.</p> <p>"No," he said, and she thought back to the moment when she first heard his voice in her office at work. The words made her a little wetter than she usually did without even touching herself, and she had to admit that he sounded a lot softer than the forceful man he had been when she saw him in the hall as he passed. And, for once, she had enjoyed making him go.</p> <p>"Yes, Master," she managed to say, almost too loudly.</p> <p>"Standâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
