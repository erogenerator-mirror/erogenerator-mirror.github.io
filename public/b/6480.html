As she spread her legs further I plunged two of my fingers deep into her pussy, my thumb rolling the nub over her clit. She whimpered with need and pleasure, her eyes shut tight as I finger-fucked her faster and faster. When she felt my thumb press against her G-spot I felt her own body start to twitch and her pussy began to spasm with pleasure. Her voice muffled as her head fell back.</p> <p>When she came I withdrew my hand and removed the tape from her pussy. My mouth clamped over hers and I thrust my tongue hard up into her, her mouth closing around mine as our tongues danced deep in each other's mouths. My hands fisted in her hair and she pushed her tits harder against my chest and her hips bucked against me, rubbing her clit against the underside of my throbbing member as our lips parted and our tongues mingled again. I felt a rush of satisfaction at sharing my wife with another man.</p> <p>"That was hot," I heard her say and turned to see another person standing there watching us.</p> <p>I looked at her, surprised and elated.</p> <p>"What's going on here?" he said.</p> <p>I looked at him with her eyes.</p> <p>"You're jealous," I accused him. He gave me a look that had a dangerous undertone to it. I had made love with another man just a few minutes ago and it had seemed so right. He hadn't gotten turned on by the thought of a woman with a stranger. He walked over and sat down in the chair next to me.</p> <p>"Why are you getting all possessive?" he said with a smile, looking at her in amusement.</p> <p>"You know what I don't want," I told him. I took a moment to think about the idea that she didn't want him just yet. She might just want him to stop before she could lose her man, but she was on the pill. She could not resist him.</p> <p>"Oh man," he said, "it's a beautiful arrangement." He leaned over and kissed her. Her arms circled around him and mine did the same to him. He was a good kisser and I loved kissing a man's mouth. I moved my hand over to massage his cock through his pants and he moaned with pleasure. When he was about seven inches long and thick, I could not resist his hard cock in my hand and he moaned as I stroked him. I let him go and kissed and sucked his nipples until he moved his hands up to stroke the sides of my face.</p> <p>"Turn around," he said, pulling me with him. I complied, turning to face him and his hands on the small of my back. I moved my lips to the front of his neck and he took the hint. He kissed my neck and I felt a thrill as his lips touched my earlobe. I knew the moment of truth was close to. I took a deep breath and moved my tongue to touch his lips. His mouth parted to meet mine and he pulled me towards him. His tongue slid past my lips to my ear where it gently grazed the side of my cheek. He tasted of smoke and salt as he kissed me, the smell of his mouth filled me.</p> <p>I wanted more and my pussy pulsed. His hand moved up my back to undo my bra. He slid his hand inside and I gasped as he rubbed my erect nipple through the fabric of my bra, rubbing it up and down with each movement of his hand. When he finished unclasping my bra he pushed my up onto his lap and lay me back and took a moment to see the sight of my naked breasts. I looked at him but he had my attention now. He smiled at me then and leaned over to kiss my lips, lightly grazing his teeth down the side of my lip just enough to cause it to pop out. He slid his tongue down into my mouth and I sucked on it, feeling it harden and pulse with my own tongue. He moved to my nipple again and gently played with it while his hand slid back up to feel my pussy. He moved his tongue to my bare breast and ran his fingers over my hard nipple, bringing another shudder of joy from my chest. When he slipped his fingers inside me, his thumb pressing against my clit I felt my body arch under him and he groaned against my neck.</p> <p>"Touch yourself," he said, "feel how wet you are."</p> <p>"Oh, God," I moaned, "please," I panted. His finger slid back into my pussy, filling me with it and his thumb rubbed against my clit like a guitar string, "please," I chantedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
