I took my position behind her, my cock still lodged in her pussy. She leaned back against the chair and used her free hand to play with her tits. I knew what her orgasm was after the oral sex so I was not surprised. I took that as the signal to begin. "Take me," I said. "I want to make love to you in your sweet mouth."</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>I plunged in to her, starting slowly, letting her lips touch my glans. One hand on her breast, the other holding and caressing her clitoris. She came as I touched her. I felt the shudders as she came. I was close too, but I needed more. I began to cum, feeling it flood through my loins, a warm sensation. Her eyes, which weren't closed, opened, and she kissed me and tasted herself on me. When we sat down for a moment, all was forgotten. She turned to look up at me, a look of disbelief on her face.</p> <p>"Whoa," I cried. "You scared me."</p> <p>"I loved it. It wasn't the first time I have done that."</p> <p>"Whoa, what do you mean?"</p> <p>"The first time I have ever done a 69, when we had to go out on the patio."</p> <p>"You know, you're the first person I've ever done that."</p> <p>"Yes, I see. How about you?"</p> <p>"I haven't. It just kind of happened, and I don't want to rush it."</p> <p>"It's no rush. This first time for both of us is a first for both of us."</p> <p>I slid my semi-erect penis out of her and reached out for another condom. This time, it took me a few minutes to get it on. I had expected it and had to try it again, but it hurt when I pulled it on. I went back to where I was sitting and laid down, pulling her on top of me. The feeling of her vagina against my penis, was more than I could take. She began bouncing on my pelvis, taking me in her deeply. My cock responded to the sensation, growing again in her vagina. My hands began pinching her buttocks, and I felt the tightness of her anus as our bodies slammed together. We were both shaking, trying to get the energy back enough to hold off this amazing experience.</p> <p>"That's it, baby," I said.</p> <p>"That it baby. That's it," she said.</p> <p>"How do you feel?"</p> <p>"Oh great," came the response. "I feel really energized."</p> <p>The pleasure was building again. She was bouncing faster and, my cock felt fuller than before. She had lost any control. I knew I was going to cum. I pulled her down to me and held her there, not moving or moving from her. She kissed me, then her tongue invaded my mouth and we kissed as I began ejaculating into her. She was moaning and gasping, each little sound punctuated with the sound of sex.</p> <p>She collapsed on top of me and I held her for a solid minute. She kissed all the while. I had to feel her again. Her warmth, her warmth, was so great, so great, so damn goodâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
