"I really do appreciate his help today, but it would be better if he came back with us next time."</p> <p>Honey reached out and touched Alyse's head where she had a look of pain. She then looked at me and said, "I guess my best boyfriend's leaving. You know you can still stay here with him whenever you want, right?" I nodded. "What time did he leave?"</p> <p>"5:00."</p> <p>"Where would we go," I asked her.</p> <p>"Just like this, and then go back to my room."</p> <p>I thought I had made a little progress today, and I could see on her face that this morning she was going to be horny all week. "Well, I guess we better call it a day." It turns up that she never talked to me about what she did with Todd.</p> <p>"Thanks, but you can call me anytime, okay?" and she winked at me.</p> <p>I agreed to meet her at 5:00 so that we could get together and see how our new relationship had turned out. We went back to the game room, but this time I showed her my new cell for the afternoon. She said, "I have one of those earphones on." and smiled like she was glad to see me.</p> <p>At 4:25, Alyse asked if I would like to dance. I told her I was feeling a little tired, so I said yes. She told me she enjoyed being a DJ. I put my hand on her hip and slowly danced with her to the music.</p> <p>When we got to the dance floor, I turned her around. I had on a shirt and no pants. Her hips were swaying to the beat, her hips moving against my chest. We had fun dancing our way around the room, her hair tickling my nose while she reached for my hand. By 5:30, I had a firm hold on her hips, pulled her towards me and pushed my hips into hers. Her hips were grinding against my groin, and she looked so beautiful. A song that had nothing to do but to have it played took place, so we danced all the way to an end of the room.</p> <p>I turned her towards me, put my lips to hers, and asked "What do you think?"</p> <p>She gave me a mischievous smile, and said, "You're so sexy and you turn me on. I can feel myself getting so wet."</p> <p>I reached in my pocket and found a pair of shorts, and I turned, pulled her around in front of me, and undid her sandals. Her hair fell down around her shoulders, and I put my hand on her neck and back. She arched her head back, and I could see a little of her neck. We looked at each other for an extended couple of moments, she looking at me and I looking back at her.</p> <p>After a bit, I asked if I could take them off, so she let me take them down. I took her hands in mine and raised her onto the bar stool, so we were sitting side by side. We looked into each other's eyes, with a few moments of hesitation to be sure this wasn't a dream, but it was. I asked, "What do you want?"</p> <p>"Let's go dancing, lover."</p> <p>We made our way to the dance floor. Alyse was not only swaying to the drumbeat of the song, she was moving her hips a little more than usual, and I was beginning to get an idea there. My thoughts got out of control and I almost forgot how far my leg and leg from the knee to where my pants rested, I was in a dress shirt and was dancing with a girl. I took a quick look at her and she had this confused look on her face, and a look of uncertainty, which turned into a grin as she said "What's wrong lover?? I thought we agreed to let you dance?"</p> <p>"I'm not sure what you're talking about!" I teased her, and ran my hand up her thigh.</p> <p>She gave me a devilish smile, reached down and rubbed my fingers around the crotch of the pants she was wearing. I quickly turned a little red and looked at her eyes as she pulled away a little. I went back to my dancing with that sexy girl, but I saw that she was a different person, and I had to force into some action. I knew I had to start the evening off in a pretty good way, so I told her so, and began to unbutton her top. First by slipping it off of her shoulders, and then unbuttoning her top to get it off. Once the top was undone, she let out a little gasp, and I saw that she had a sexy smile on her lipsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
