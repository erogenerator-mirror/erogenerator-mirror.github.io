You can't leave your husband, you need to bring someone else in your bed. I'll be able to do this all day."</p> <p>- You really think I'll do this. Why don't we just have sex? I'll watch you and you can do whatever you want. Then, you can decide on who you like and who you know that I'll probably want, and you can decide how to fuck your husband.</p> <p>- You'll have to choose how to use a strap-on!</p> <p>- I think you get an erection from thinking that you've chosen a lover. You need to cum or I'll just keep you hard. The choice is yours. In fact, you can start by fucking me while I lie back, pull up my skirt and let you fuck me.</p> <p>- Well, since I already chose the strap-on, I'll use my dildo and I'll lie back. I can get on all fours and you can fuck me while you lie on your back, but you must be ready for more than that. In fact, before and after you have sex, you come to my pussy to eat my pussy.</p> <p>- But we can't do that, we can't do this all day!</p> <p>- You really are the smartest person in the world, honey. You can be such a smart guy!</p> <p>- I know that, darling. I want to give you a night you'll never forget but I'll be in the mood to play.</p> <p>- Do you mean to tell me that, darling? I haven't had enough! I can't take any more of your teasing but, please, play me for the next day! I have to keep my promises.</p> <p>- I know that you really want to play with me again. I promised myself that you'd want to do this again. Why can't we do it now? You may be my lover but I've come to you to give you a real fuck by my own hand. But, you must be willing to let me. What a wonderful woman you are. I've got your attention now, I want you to think about it until you decide. Maybe, your hubby won't come home from work in the morning and you could have him all to yourself this beautiful and sexy day. But, you must let me know first. After all, you didn't tell me what to do and, perhaps, it might be best that you don't know.</p> <p>- You could do that, but what about some other choice?</p> <p>- I'll do anything you say to give me a choice between having fun and just making you cum. It doesn't really matter, really. And, it might feel like sex to me but it's a good trade and, if I choose you, I'll let you have your cock and do whatever you want with it.</p> <p>- What about you doing it with my husband and all my lover?</p> <p>- I've got the same idea but, you have to promise not to get aroused by me playing with you like that! Remember that I'm not your lover but, I'll let you play with your penis to please me, but I promise not to orgasm when you do it.</p> <p>- I'll make you cum right here and right now.</p> <p>- Okay, honey, you have to give your lover something good for his orgasm and I'll let you have him too. Are you sure that you want your husband to cum when you do it?</p> <p>- Oh! Yes, I'm sure. There! Now, lie down and let me finish what I'm doing with you. Just hold on to my armchair, please.</p> <p>- I've got something that you'll love to try. I'll just do it myself, as you like, just don't touch me!</p> <p>- Yes. I always enjoyed that ideaâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
