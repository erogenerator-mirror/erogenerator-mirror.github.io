Aislinn laughed. I couldn't believe she was actually going to actually go down on me. I just laughed.</p> <p>"Please," I said. She didn't say anything and it was getting very close to midnight.</p> <p>"Please what?" she asked. "I'm not so sure that this is a good time, because I don't know if I'm ready."</p> <p>"No, it's a good time," I said. "It's been too long."</p> <p>"Oh," Aislinn said, "you don't want the lights off and you have to have a hard time. You don't want to be getting my cum on you." I still wasn't sure what it might have to do with a woman wanting me to cum in her or in her. It didn't seem possible that I would enjoy this. I looked over at Aislinn for a moment. She was still looking at me. I looked down at the floor.</p> <p>"You should probably get to bed," I said. "There aren't any light switches in here."</p> <p>"No," Aislinn said, "I can't be quiet." For a moment I wondered where the light switch was and if she was going to be asleep soon. I didn't care, since this really needed the lights off. Aislinn smiled at me and said, "Go to bed."</p> <p>"I can't," I said. "Just go to bed."</p> <p>"No, please don't," she said. "We don't have to." I leaned forward and kissed her one at a time. She didn't kiss me back. After a minute I said, "This is really too easy."</p> <p>"Do it! Just do it. I don't mind if we just do it on my bed, but we also don't need to talk about it any more." I leaned forward and kissed her again. This time, when I got to that kiss, she grabbed my face and kissed me back, much harder this time. She moved her hands on my face, which I was trying to get better at over the next several minutes. Aislinn started taking off her panties while I kissed her, then pulled off her bra and threw it off.</p> <p>"Okay, that's no way for me to do this. It's not right," I said. "If I kissed you this much it's because I'm done with it. Besides, I could get caught if you didn't move."</p> <p>"I'm sorry," Aislinn said. "I'm sorry." She moved her hand back and touched mine, but then she took it and I kissed it. She did the same the same on the other side. It was nice to kiss. When we got over we were both trying to do the same things on the same spot. Finally, after a long while, Aislinn got up off the pillow and straddled my lap before sitting on my stomach. She leaned forward and looked me in the eyes.</p> <p>"I want you to be completely at ease, and I want to keep my lips where they belong," she said. Her hand came up to rub my stomach as she moved closer until she put her lips right in front of mine. For the first time that night, my cock was hard. Aislinn leaned right back and leaned forward. Her right hand reached down and started rubbing my cock. I could feel the heat of her hand.</p> <p>"What's yours better than mine though? It's the best there," she said. Her hand just barely touched the head. I looked down. Her finger nails were really strong on my cock. It felt like two fingers, one at a time, and one on each side. When her finger went under my shaft, she rubbed it up and down, just for a little while. Her hand still stroking me, she lifted my cock back up toward my stomach.</p> <p>"Do you want me to kiss it?" she asked.</p> <p>"I...I'm okay with this." I was getting excited and needed to know that she wouldn't be afraid to kiss me.</p> <p>"We should kiss more," I said. She didn't say a word. I moved my hands over top of hers, then up her body to her breasts. I felt Aislinn's nipples under my palms. I leaned my head down and took her left nipple in my mouth.</p> <p>Aislinn leaned back and said, "Oh, that feels good." I felt her body shift a little and realized that she would be falling off the bed. She got off and lay on her back with legs apart so I could get the most contact possible. I kissed around her nipple and then moved down to her pussy as I took theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
