I want you to suck my cock."</p> <p>Without hesitation Beth sucked his cock until it was hard. She took his cock in her little red hand as she kissed it and slid it in to her mouth. Then she slid her mouth down his shaft again until her lips touched his pubic hair. She worked herself back slowly until she felt his head on the back of her throat and then slid his cock all the way down to the balls before pulling up. She got back to sucking and stroking his cock. She stroked it slowly and with long firm strokes. She used her tongue to pleasure his head. She looked at him and said, "Please fuck my face."</p> <p>He stepped forward and reached down to pull her face against his cock. Then he turned her around and lowered her to her knees. He spread her pussy lips wide as he positioned himself between her legs. He looked up at their reflection in the mirror. They were still on her knees and he leaned forward and stuck his cock in her. As he fucked her he reached up and began running fingers along her legs. Their little sex drive was starting to take over. Her little body felt different because she had such small tits. They were larger and they hung heavy with big pink areola nipples that almost pulled on your hand as you pulled the nipple. Her belly was thicker and she must have had a bigger belly button due to her body. Beth's little pussy was so full of him. She felt like she had one or two pounds of weight on him. He drove his cock into her with long slow strokes that brought on their small sex act.</p> <p>He was getting closer to coming. His cock felt as if it would explode any second. Beth looked up into the mirror again and saw that the face in the mirror showed the same intense look she always had. She lifted her knees so she could better control her pussy and he increased his speed. Then she saw that she had a bigger belly button than just a month ago.</p> <p>Beth closed her eyes and felt his cock slide across the small lips just on the tip. She felt his heavy balls slap against her ass. She looked at his shaft sliding in and out of her as he drove his cock deep into her. After a few moments he felt the orgasm well up into his balls and he could feel her squeezing his cock. She looked at him in the mirror as he slowly withdrew his cock from her pussy and came all over her belly. Beth opened her eyes and smiled up at him as he held himself above her so that she could see his sperm covered cock. "Do you still remember those photographs on the wall behind you" he asked.</p> <p>She opened her eyes and looked at them. "Yes, it was a great video." "Thank you," he said. He took her hand and placed it on his cock for her to stroke it. "Let's go to sleep and get some rest. It's your turn now."</p> <p>"Yes but I think we are going too slowly on this little plan of ours."</p> <p>THE ENDâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
