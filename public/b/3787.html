It wasn't all about sex for the most part, it was mostly about school and other people's lives. I was in charge of it.</p> <p>What he was doing, he was fucking my roommate. I can't say I approved at that point. I was totally pissed. I would've said something like "This is incest!" but I had no intention of doing that.</p> <p>It was almost as bad in truth. I loved my roommate. We had the typical things. We talked about school, the kids, everything. He liked me. We talked about his girlfriend. There was this stuff. He'd gone out to the movies. If I didn't watch a movie he'd come home early.</p> <p>"This is our new little secret."</p> <p>"Ok, come on. Did I tell you to stop? Are you kidding me? Is that why I didn't say anything the other night about it? I was drunk and there were only two of us." He had said it, he was just being very open. I'm sure he had known that the whole time, but it wasn't hard to see. Just this way, it seemed I was going to be getting my hands on what he was capable of.</p> <p>"No, I don't know. I'm not sure if I can go through with this. This isn't me at all."</p> <p>"I guess you shouldn't be too worried. You know, there's no harm in a little sex, right?"</p> <p>"Oh, I see. Well, maybe you should be honest with me, I think I've been doing myself in a good bit."</p> <p>"Go on," he smiled and raised his eyebrows as he waited for an answer.</p> <p>He was sitting on one end of the couch. I could see from the front of him that he had a very hard cock, which made his body appear even bigger than normal. He had a short ponytail which made him look almost ten years younger. He definitely had a great set of abs.</p> <p>"Here's the part where I was at the mall trying on clothes as much as I could. It's kind of a turn-on for me to be in a pair or even a thong. I'm in jeans and a button down shirt, and this top is pretty much standard."</p> <p>He was smiling. "You know, you look really nice. I really appreciate everything you've done for the past few months."</p> <p>"Thanks. It was nice for me to have someone help me in that department, so I guess I'd say I'm pretty satisfied with things."</p> <p>*</p> <p>I was nervous. I knew his opinion of me was wrong, but at this point it really didn't matter. His opinion was irrelevant. It wasn't his cock. But it would be my opinion about me. It wasn't in control.</p> <p>I was so nervous I was trembling. It was all of the last week between a breakup and the start of the year that I was getting increasingly frustrated. My roommate had been the first one to put in a move in our sex life. We'd hit it off after a few dates and he's always had a great relationship with me, and I was the one who made up my mind to go for broke. I was trying to think of how he might be a friend, and it seemed he was always available. He was just the other thing with me. My body responded to him well for a girl.</p> <p>I'm sure if the time passed by that I would have had the biggest crush on him, or the most beautiful boyfriend I could ever have.</p> <p>Instead, if nothing else, he made my mind up that he had made the right decision to come to see me. That he seemed just as eager to be with me and maybe even join in this thing. To go out and see a movie and fuck like a maniac.</p> <p>I was almost to the end of the hallway when I had to stop breathing.</p> <p>"Well, I think we should get the hell out here before we get our hopes up."</p> <p>I was so scared that if he came to the door, I'd be naked. I had to run all over the house to get him to help with anything I could find. I had no idea where we were going if he had the key but I decided it might be important on a different level of friendship. If he came to see me naked, I would know it was wrong and if it did something to me, I thought we could go straight there.</p> <p>Instead, he looked at me and asked, "How could we possibly have a relationship that didn't work out with that friend of yours? I think the least you could do is ask." I was so afraid of how his cock would react, or how I would handle his rejectionâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
