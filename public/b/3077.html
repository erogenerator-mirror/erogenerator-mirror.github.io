He had a feeling that that would bring in some of the work that his mother wasn't capable of.</p> <p>He got dressed and had the door open and saw the doorbell.</p> <p>"Who is it, sir?" "Hello sir" he called out.</p> <p>He was glad that none of the neighbors could hear him now. That would give him the ability to get his ass out of the house at this time. He opened the door and saw the person that he was calling on.</p> <p>"Oh...hello sir." "I was just looking for some help. How are you? Well, my mom just showed up and she wanted to know if everything was ok..I'm fine so you can come help me now sir. Oh, by the way, I'm Mike, not Mr."</p> <p>"Ok Mike. Thanks for ringing the doorbell" "It was only a matter of minutes and I came to see if we were alright." "Oh, no we're not fine. My mom just showed up to visit. She's worried sick, I really am. I didn't even have time to talk with her. I'm sorry to disturb you sir."</p> <p>"Well, I should be back in a second, I'm going to go make her sit down and make the usual sign and then we can talk this through. Here, let me make her a drink?"</p> <p>"No thank you. I'll just sit on the couch and get her on her way sir" "Sure, I'll be right back." He put the box of drinks down and stood up and walked over to the couch. He didn't want her to feel uneasy. While he made a show of walking over to her and sitting down. He saw her come over to him and kneel beside him.</p> <p>"Hi there" "You look like you could use a drink?" "Yes, thanks." He took the drinks he made and brought them to her. "Did everything alright in here." she asked.</p> <p>"Everything is good. Your mom is here and she doesn't even know that I am here. Just stay out of your way and listen." He said. He placed the glasses around her neck and she took a sip of the drink. "Is your car here?" She asked after taking a drink of the drink.</p> <p>"Oh, no, my car is here. We're here to talk and not to talk. I'm not going to do anything too crazy. I had no plans for this meeting. The car's here so it's just going back to the office." "So it is my turn now to speak with you." He put his head down and looked up at the ceiling, letting his anger die down.</p> <p>"Yes, sir. I am sorry that you see me like this." He said looking at his hands in front of him. "If you see me, stand up and go and get over here and sit down. And have a seat next to me. OK?" "Yes, sir." She said as she stood up and walked over to him. She leaned down and put her arms around his neck for a hug and then kissed him on the cheek. "Thank you for keeping me all this from you," she said. "See you later"</p> <p>"Wait, wait. Wait, let's go."</p> <p>"No, we're not leaving this house until I have finished with what I have to do."</p> <p>She got up and walked to the door and saw it was open and she ran through through the house as fast as she could. As she went upstairs she stopped suddenly and looked back at the bedroom door and saw that it was open and she could faintly breathe in. She took the jacket off of her and put it in the bedroom and grabbed a pair of panties from her nightstand.</p> <p>"Ok, I'm really tired, but if you can handle this you have a deal" She said to her closet. "Can you get me her stuff?" Her hands shook as she tossed her shoulder bag to the floor and found her things.</p> <p>"Sure, but you can pick everything up later." She said and went back to the couch.</p> <p>"Yeah, I'll come over."</p> <p>"But I have to get back to work. My mom is sick and she wants to go home. I guess I better go, ok?" "That was very thoughtful of you. I appreciate it" "I don't know what I would have done." "Please stay, I can't stay long," "Sure." "See you soon"</p> <p>With that she turned to leave and stopped, turning back as she saw him pull his hand back from his face and she walked out of his mind.
