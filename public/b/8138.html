Would you be willing to do that for us?"</p> <p>"Sure, I can do that."</p> <p>"Then we'll sit with you. I'm sure all of us have some interesting things to say."</p> <p>I was wondering what the hell they would think of me sitting here without my wife so I didn't turn them down. I didn't want to see them all in a group, either.</p> <p>"It's going to be cool, and I think you guys are going to like being in a group together, I'm not going to worry about you, you know."</p> <p>"Yeah I know, don't worry about it."</p> <p>"Good. Now let's get some breakfast, and I'll make something for the group. I can't have it getting cold so early."</p> <p>"That looks interesting, don't we have a hot breakfast in the backyard?"</p> <p>"No, I'm afraid that we won't be able to make breakfast. The heat would be too much for someone who hasn't eaten in over three days."</p> <p>We got to the backyard and saw that all of the guys had gathered in line on one side of the porch, waiting on the next step out of the house and another out the door, just as we came around the corner. There were some who had already been drinking a bit, and there were others who were still drinking beer and playing spin the bottle on the porch.</p> <p>We got to all four of them, and as far as I could tell all the guys were still standing and talking.</p> <p>"Hey. Are you guys still in your suits? Why, what's wrong?"</p> <p>They were all standing and waiting patiently, but they didn't say anything.</p> <p>"Are you trying to play a game, or have some fun?"</p> <p>"Nope."</p> <p>Then out of the corner of eye I looked back at the group, just as a guy walked past me on his way up the stairs. After looking back I had to laugh, the guy had a huge grin on his face as he approached me.</p> <p>"Hi. How are you?"</p> <p>At that moment I felt like crying, and I was surprised that I could. I just wanted to ask him anything, but before I started to say anything, I knew it wasn't for me. I just wanted to know what the hell was all that noise. So I got a good laugh in return.</p> <p>"It's great to see you guys."</p> <p>"I'm Rob's mom," he replied in greeting.</p> <p>"Well you looked great tonight," I had to laugh again at the way he looked at me.</p> <p>He looked at me as if trying to read my mind, which of course, wasn't my mind. Rob did that about ten times.</p> <p>"Sorry. That was not my intent."</p> <p>We all kept in stride, talking and getting along, while trying not to make eye contact with the girls, or the guys. The atmosphere remained awkward, although it was very easy to talk in return. I just wanted to know something that I was afraid to talk about. After a few minutes I said it again, this time without being so direct.</p> <p>"I'm Lisa. Let me introduce you to my friends."</p> <p>I looked at both of them. I had never met Lisa before, and she obviously hadn't the time to introduce herself.</p> <p>"We're the family," I replied, hoping to get the meaning of that statement.</p> <p>She didn't answer, and I could tell that she wasn't very happy with my comment. I guess she wasn't happy with what the guys had told me.</p> <p>"So, Lisa, did you and John really have a good time?" Lisa asked me.</p> <p>I was trying to come up with some sort of answer to that question, but it didn't come to me. I really couldn't tell her that I didn't like her friends or that she didn't seem to like any of my friends.</p> <p>"We were having fun. You know that, right?" she said.</p> <p>I took it in with a simple, "Yeah."</p> <p>The three of us sat next to one another, drinking, and talking as if we were not really in the same room. I knew that Rob had some more trouble with her friends than me, but it was kind of fun to try to change that.</p> <p>After about 20 minutes of drinking beer and talking, I decided to take the plunge, that was, if things worked out.</p> <p>"Can we do something for you?" I asked her with aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
