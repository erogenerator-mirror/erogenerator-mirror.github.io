The combination of my desire to fuck him and to make him cum brought on my next orgasm when his tongue was on my clit. I let all of the pent up frustration of being unable to even have full body contact with my lover overwhelm into two orgasms that made me quiver and shiver in his arms.</p> <p>With a final shudder, I collapsed against his chest like a post and fell asleep next to him.</p> <p>After I caught my breath, we both went to the bathroom to clean up a little and clean up the rest of our mess. Mike turned on the shower, stepped in and then we stepped into the shower together. Just as the water was starting to run cool, I noticed something on the shower wall. I looked around and saw the dildo Mike had put in his pocket on the end of the wall. It was the one he had slipped into my ass the first time we had sex. It was the part in my backside where he put the dildo on my first time. A strange sense of security, and maybe even a little of the excitement of having my lover's cock in my ass, started to build in me as I held my breath anticipating another encounter with Mike's big cock.</p> <p>I didn't even think to think about his cock before I had slipped the toy into my tight ass and slid it home immediately. I knew that as soon as it was in, I would cum again. It was a strange feeling, but exhilarating too.</p> <p>"Mike!" I startled myself when I heard him calling my name.</p> <p>I quickly put a couple of washcloths in our hands. When he saw the towel I still had on hanging on the wall, he grabbed the towel I had wrapped round me and wrapped it around my waist. He pulled me close and kissed me. As we touched, the soft feeling of his hands on mine, the hard grip of his hands on my skin, and the warmth of the water running over our bodies, was like nothing I had ever felt before, never before. He reached for the soap and asked me to turn around.</p> <p>"Mike, you know I don't usually..."</p> <p>"I know," I whispered. "But you won't ever forget that I know... That your ass is my property, too. I knew it that first time... That you were a willing lover."</p> <p>"I am not just an interested lover," he said, "and you know that. I think it would be fun to make love... That we would be intimate." He kissed me again, and his hands slid down my belly to my cock. He started to rub the head against my erection. "But now I really want to play," he said, "You know, I've never fucked a girl or a woman before. Ever."</p> <p>We both laughed.</p> <p>"I have never..." he answered hesitantly.</p> <p>"Really?" I asked hopefully.</p> <p>He smiled, "Well, actually I've never fucked a girl but you, so don't stop now. I want a lot more pleasure just from your ass."</p> <p>I knew exactly what he meant, so I did what he wanted. When he felt my cock, he pulled away, and we kissed, deeply and slowly, lovingly. Mike held my cock and looked me in the eyes. "You have a beautiful cock," he said.</p> <p>"Thank you, Baby," I said, "It's a nice cock, Lover."</p> <p>"I don't care why," he continued, "I want to fuck you."</p> <p>It was not easy, but eventually he had to ask, so I asked. "Are you sure you want to? If not, then go ahead and let me go..."</p> <p>"Mmm... I'm sure. Please don't be a prude, okay?" he said.</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>He held his hands out to me, and as I was about to take them, he leaned his head down and took my cock into his wet warm mouth. Before I knew it, he had my fully erect cock in his mouth. It felt as though he was trying to suck me off, but I was so turned on that I had no control over what he was doing. It felt so good. I had never felt so alive as I felt when Mike was servicing me. His hand was rubbing my balls as he sucked on my throbbing shaft. It felt different when his hand was moving up and down on my cock. It felt like it was a tongue. It was exciting! He worked on me, licking my cock, sucking on my cock like it was a lollipop, not like anyone I had ever been with. He knew exactly what he was doing. It felt wonderful.
