Of course Tim had to go along and the girls went back to the office with Tina and me to talk and share the story. It was great and we ended up buying lunch while the girls watched and ate, laughing their asses off.</p> <p>Dinner ended with some of the ladies showing us all their wedding photos and we went to see some of the photos of Tina and I and got some nice looks as well. We all had a great time talking and doing a lot of eye-balling. We were all friends from before the wedding so we all got along well. We all finished dinner and decided to call it a day. We went into the bathroom together and Tina and I showered and we both grabbed our swim suits and headed for the pool to swim. We were all naked as soon as possible and dove in the pool, enjoying the water and getting even closer to a good time before the swim-in. Tina and I talked about the wedding and what was coming up for us. We decided that we'd all have a glass of champagne and join the others there in the hot tub, getting another good look at each other's bodies as soon as we were inside.</p> <p>Tina said she just came downstairs to use the bathroom, but I told her we'd go and use the upstairs bathroom. As soon as Tina and I were in the hot tub, we went down to our room and had another glass of champagne before joining the others. We were all giggling and splashing around, talking and getting to know each other even better. We had sex with each other several times before the girls left us to go to dinner. It was great and we each had several wonderful orgasms as we went and told stories. Afterwards, we had another glass of champagne before heading home and spending the weekend in bed with our spouses.</p> <p>The days went by and we were getting a lot of photos that Tina and I took over the next several months while we were together. It was wonderful and we enjoyed each other as much as we did each other. Every other night we would go for a walk up and down the beach. We saw different groups of holiday makers on and off the beach and often came into sight of each other in various states of undress. We always checked the pool before us and when we finished our walk, we ran to the bathroom and showered together. We did a lot more than take our clothes off the first time. Each time we were done we did more or less the same thing, but we both looked at each other as soon as we got our suits off. I loved seeing her bare body and my own body reacting as I did the same.</p> <p>We also decided to call our favorite beach house, the beach house, and it would be something we had in mind when we picked up Tina and me last Friday. There was always a part of the beach house that looked out to us because of it. We planned on going for our walk around the house that evening when we were all dressed, before we came back. It was a great opportunity to plan the whole vacation.</p> <p>We met up with my sister on Saturday afternoon after work and headed out to our favorite walk along the beach. We did the typical thing but we were just the 3 of us on the beach. We had a couple of guys on the beach, but it was just Tina, Tim and me. We made out every chance we had. At times we'd be on the grass or grass in the sun. One of our friends had a camera and we made sure it wasn't the beach. We were kissing and cuddling as we went, but we didn't make a scene and were just being silly. We stopped our kissing to catch our breath.</p> <p>I looked over in the direction of Tim and Tina's house, not being able to see them I asked him to look when he saw me. Tim had a grin on his face so I knew he had been caught. I quickly gave him a dirty look which caused him to laugh. I just looked back towards them and told him to be careful not to get caught too early.</p> <p>When we were done with our walk we took a little break from our kissing and laid back on the grass where we could look out at the beach and not look in the eyes. I felt silly lying there with my brother and sister on the beach. Our group went on a walk a few miles off the beach and I watched them, Tina and Tim talking and joking about the events of the day.</p> <p>Once the couple was a couple of hours away we just casually laid down and relaxed for the duration of it all. I couldn't believe my luck that I was making out with my brother's wife on the beach with all our friends watching. It was really hot and I didn't mind one bit. The day had beenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
