She took it and smiled, leaning back on the sofa, still looking me up and down.</p> <p>"Now, it is, isn't it?"</p> <p>"Oh yes!" I answered her.</p> <p>Laughing she leaned towards me and opened her mouth. She took the nipple between her lips and flicked the head with her tongue. "Is it nice?"</p> <p>"Mmm yes, very nice."</p> <p>"What shall it be, my sweet?" she asked.</p> <p>I ran my hands over her shoulders, down her chest and rested them on her hips. She raised her arms, bringing them up, placing them above my head. Her eyes fluttered a little as I cupped her chest and pinched the pink, swollen nipple gently. She gasped as I did this, and I slowly moved my hands down her sides, kneading her. I could hear her breathing getting more labored, her nipples becoming more stiff. She took my hands and placed them behind my head, then slid back, leaning back, letting her hands drop down and grip the hem of my shirt, raising it up over my head.</p> <p>When I was standing there, she slowly peeled off my shirt, and reached down, caressing my naked chest, her hands coming into contact with my bare skin. She lifted her hands above her head, and pulled the shirt, and my undershirt back over my head. As she slipped the shirt from my shoulders and threw it aside, she laid her head back. As she sat up again, she reached back and undid the button and fly of the jeans, letting them fall to the floor. Now the pants, she raised her shapely legs, turning around, lifting her ass. She slid one arm under the back of the sofa, and then ran her fingers down the front of her legs, pulling her labia apart. I leaned forward. "May I?" she whispered. I could feel my cock throbbing again. I raised my head slowly.</p> <p>"Not quite yet." She pulled me around to face her, and pressed my face between her legs. My tongue darted out into her wetness, sucking it as I pushed my head into her. I wanted so much to taste her, to feel her orgasm flowing through her, to make her come for me. She arched her back, pushing her pussy forward, taking my head as she did so, and I moved to the other end. I stood up, and reached out her hands. She held my wrists, as I ran my hands up her body, my fingers leaving red hand-prints of desire on her skin. I brought one hand back to her breast and took her nipple between my fingers, lightly grazing her nipple. She moaned now.</p> <p>I took one of her hands and led it to her pussy. I pulled her panties down and off, and then knelt down, pushing her legs apart. I lowered myself to her and rubbed my lips across her slit.</p> <p>"Oh, god, John, what are you doing?" she stammered out. She reached for the blanket on the back of the sofa, and spread it as the top of it came free. She was already soaking. I moved forward, and looked at her vagina for a second. She seemed nervous.</p> <p>"I was thinking that perhaps we should just fuck now."</p> <p>"Fuck?" she exclaimed. She looked at me, and giggled. "I thought that you were talking about something else."</p> <p>"Well, it's possible, isn't it?"</p> <p>"Oh yes it is," she laughed. "Yes. I think not."</p> <p>I ran my finger up a finger-length across her lower lips. She shivered. "Can I?" I asked. She nodded.</p> <p>"I think I know where this might lead for us to start. Would you mind if I took my panties and jeans off?"</p> <p>"Of course not!" she giggled. But then her eyes widened. "No! You are too much!" she said, then lowered her voice to something like a whisper, "I want to suck you again!"</p> <p>"Oh, yes," I whispered back, my finger rubbing her back. She was so moist I could feel how aroused she was by the prospect of tasting her. She gasped as I slid my finger between her legs, and she grabbed my wrist. "There. Take them off."</p> <p>I felt her fingers hesitate, so I dropped to my knees, my cheek and mouth coming into contact with her pussy. "You have a lovely pussy, Susan," I whispered. I used my tongue to trace the outline of her pussy, tasting her and letting my fingernails dance across her labia.
