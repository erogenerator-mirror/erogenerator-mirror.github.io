You know, all the guys who have gotten their hands on me or on me and who are still getting to know me so well? I really mean that. You know I would have to be more than just one of the guys. I know the real guys are all here on the team, they've got their feet in the company. This is going way too far. They need to get it back and be happy with it's success."</p> <p>I said, "I'm here, and I don't want to talk about it, that's not what this is about. It's just that I'm a little tired right now. I need to stretch my legs." It was clear I had gone from feeling as though I had been sleeping, to feeling refreshed. I got up and went to the bathroom and got dressed. I had the bed made and was still wearing my jacket.</p> <p>I thought I heard some shuffling. I opened the door. A couple of the guys were talking in the other room, and two of them were now standing with their backs to me. The two guys turned and looked at me for a moment.</p> <p>One of the guys said, "Honey, we can't do this. It's just wrong. I can't do this. I'll talk to your parents, explain it to you. I don't know if you like my daughter or not. You can have what you want."</p> <p>I said, "No, it isn't that," I put my arms around him, and pulled him close. "We're here to help you, so don't try to make a fool of yourself either. Please don't try to get involved." I said.</p> <p>Once again it took a moment for the guys to react. It seemed like an eternity and no one responded.</p> <p>He looked at my arm, then back at the guys and said, "I guess you can tell me where my daughter is but don't make any sudden moves, OK?"</p> <p>I let go and said, "OK, I have to go back, I'll see you at 730. OK with you?" I turned and headed back into the office. The next thing I know my coat is on the chair next to mine. I was not wearing it, but I decided to keep my blouse, my work skirt or my thong in plain sight. I put my bra and panties on right after I got up to go.</p> <p>I got back to my office a bit early but my head was still clear. I opened an email about the party, and there wasn't a shred of doubt that the job was going to get done. I was actually tired before I really realized it, I think I slept for five minutes before I started feeling better.</p> <p>When I got back home, the kids were asleep, but my boss took me in hand and we went out to dinner, or rather had a date. I was feeling pretty good about myself at the time and just wanted to be seen with my boss.</p> <p>At the end of dinner we danced, at the bar, and at the end of two drinks I got him to admit he had wanted more than one dance. He said he was nervous but wouldn't object to any more. The next time I danced with the two of them I found he wanted more than just that. He got me out of my clothes very easily, in fact we danced almost naked on the dance floor. I was enjoying myself, and when I tried to get his hand to go under my skirt he just slipped it away, but it was a mistake since we both took our partners in our arms.</p> <p>I asked him to leave it and see his wife, who was sitting at the bar with her husband. "I'm not getting married tomorrow unless I can have all of me by 5 AM here, and he was sure that would be one of the few times that he could enjoy the night." He looked at me and said, "That's a lovely idea. We'll have more time with you, maybe in our bed. I can't wait to see what you've gotten."</p> <p>After we got back to my hotel, he said, "I don't get married any more."</p> <p>"But," I tried to stop him, but he grabbed me with both hands and said, "Let's just go on and get to know each other better. I'll see how I feel after, OK?"</p> <p>"OK, you tell me when. And when do you want to do it again?" I had to laugh, I mean they had been going like hell for most of the evening.</p> <p>I told him that I had come by the job, and that I wanted to see him again, so heâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
