As soon as I got the first inkling of what could happen, I had no intention of leaving.</p> <p>I'd got home about fifteen minutes after everyone else, I heard all the commotion at the door. I was a little apprehensive when I stepped out.</p> <p>Lillian was right downstairs. But I wasn't alone. I heard footsteps upstairs. Then someone, like a child, stepped into the bedroom. I felt something hard on my cock. I couldn't see who it was, but it didn't matter. As Lillian's mouth closed around my cock, I gave it up. I could feel the head of my cock hitting the back of her warm, moist throat.</p> <p>The next thing you know, Lillian was on her knees on the end of the bed. The bed springs were squeaking and I thought Lillian was being fucked. But she didn't have time to be distracted.</p> <p>The second someone's cunt was wrapped around my cock, she was trying to suck my cock to orgasm. I didn't care and she just bobbed her head up and down while fucking my cock.</p> <p>Suddenly she got off me. I was disappointed but then I felt a new mouth on my cock. I couldn't remember when I'd had a guy in the mouth before. The mouth was hot and it just made me want my cock deep in there.</p> <p>My next thought was that Lillian loved sucking cock. She'd made a lot of guys happy. But she wanted them to love her! Now she was going down on the first guy in the bedroom for real!</p> <p>I wondered if Lillian's lips were like Giselle's. She was so flexible and eager. I watched the mouth swallow my cock; I could tell from the expression on it.</p> <p>And for the first time, I felt a finger on my asshole. My cock stiffened a little. Someone was playing a finger in my ass. I was surprised that it didn't hurt. And Lillian knew just what to do to get me hard again. It wouldn't hurt in the least if she really wanted to do it.</p> <p>One night, after they'd fucked me for an hour, I watched them fuck. This was no one's first time but it didn't hurt either. All of it just felt so fucking good. I didn't mind getting my cock sucked. It just felt so fucking good. I didn't know how a girl could ever get that excited, especially if she'd known, or even if I could tell her.</p> <p>The thing about a girl's first time with a guy was that she never really got to really feel him in her mouth, or her cunt, or even her ass, or anything like that. She'd just lay in bed, get fucked, and just relax. When it hurt a bit, it was like a relief. It was never a hard one to work out.</p> <p>It just felt like a hard one.</p> <p>There were a couple more men that night, including Lillian. When there was a bit of light, there were quite some men and some women, too. I watched them fuck and lick and kiss and suck, while I got hard. The women all came, a lot. By the end of the night, I could hardly concentrate on my own masturbation. I got hard and watched their tight, young bodies and their erect cocks and their wet pussies and their tight asses and their hard cocks bouncing, and I came.</p> <p>It was after midnight, though not before I'd watched all the action and been hard. A little after that the girls went up to bed with me. By then I had my cock sucked by one more and had another go right after it.</p> <p>I wasn't going to do it again. I'd watched all the action, even those women. That was the problem and I didn't like it at all!</p> <p>As I sat looking out the window, the sun was shining through the glass. But even then, I found the feelings of being watched and that I wasn't going to do anything about it. That was my problem. That was what mattered. I'd watched too many men, well, men who really enjoyed being watched by other men like that.</p> <p>When I thought Lillian wasn't looking, I got up, went up into the bathroom. I washed my cock. After I'd done that, I just put on my bathing suit and went back out. Lillian was still asleep from the night's escapades. I sat on the terrace. The moon was full and there were a dozen or more stars in the sky.</p> <p>As I looked at Lillian, she woke and turned toward me, grinning. It wasn't just that she was naked and there were dozens of men standing around us, all nude, grinning and staring.
