As we kissed and hugged, I was beginning to move along with her. "I need to say something. I've never had anything that big go in there, and I've always wanted to try it. This feels right. I like it...and, you know...I like my man to take me like this." I looked at her, a little teary and happy, and she looked back at me.</p> <p>"Hang on," she said quickly, "You want me to take you?" I just nodded for her to go ahead.</p> <p>Then she pulled back a little and went to her knees, grabbing at the bottom hem of my shirt. "No, no," she said slowly, "I want you to lift up, and I want you to raise me right now..." her voice went softer after she said this. Then my arms were moving so slowly; she got in front of me and raised her ass toward me. And I lifted it a bit for her. And her back arched like it had for all the years she had had her ass lifted. It had a big rounded roundness that I liked. Then I lifted her again, and I pulled the bottom of her skirt up about half way. For a moment I looked at those perfect cheeks, with the hair and crevice, and then I felt her fingers move down...she had a small, soft little hand for an asshole, and it felt fantastic and warm.</p> <p>"No," she whispered urgently, "don't..." and there was that smile again, again at me, "I don't think you'd like it..." and she turned her head so that I could have a good angle and look, and then she turned over and bent at the waist to look at me. Then she raised herself just inches from my face, and I had no idea what to do from there.</p> <p>"No," she whispered again. "That's enough," she said quietly, "I want to do you, it's okay." And then she stood on the bed, bent over a little, and looked back at me over her shoulder. "That's how I want to do it." and her hand, while still inside me, made its little slide and came out quickly. Then she reached into a little box on the night stand and took out a condom. "Let's go down to the back room," she said quietly.</p> <p>It had that big thing in the bathroom, but the little one she used was better suited than that because it slid right in when we got to her. Then I felt it hit my clit as it came out again as she slid it back in. Then she stood and reached back. Then she reached under her, grabbed my balls, and pulled them. I heard the fabric and then felt them as they were pressed in between my ass - and that, again, was all that was left was to lie on the sheets of the bed. "There," she whispered softly, "like that." She moved her panties down, and then reached behind her with both hands to untie her top. She did, and took it off, and then her bra and her panties. The panties followed suit as she stepped out of them, and then she stood, naked, and faced me again. "Now that's it...let's see you," she said with a sexy smile. Then she started the thing and I felt myself coming quickly, the whole time her hands were caressing my balls. Finally the first thing that fell out of my ass was the condom and I was ready, so I closed my eyes and just went with it...there it was.</p> <p>After a few moments, I noticed some change in our breathing. She had taken the place of the condom and was pressing her breasts against mine.</p> <p>"There you go," she whispered softly. "Do you like it?" It wasn't a question of my answer, but I could feel the whole body, maybe even the whole woman, respond to her. She was leaning against me, our arms around each other. But it had been several minutes and I didn't remember at all if she had come. Instead, I felt her breath in my ear, and that's when I felt something she hadn't ever done with me before. She had one leg between mine, and her crotch was against my thigh, and her arms were around me.</p> <p>A couple of minutes later she moved my hand to her breast and pressed it against it. "Here," I heard her say with a smile, and then she turned my head toward hers. "Honey," she said, as she drew me on to her. "Can we do this again?" I didn't have a clue why. Then she reached between her legs, and I found that she too had a finger in there now, and that was good. We were making out.</p> <p>But, I was getting close to my orgasm after aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
