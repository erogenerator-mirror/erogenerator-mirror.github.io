He felt his cock grow as he anticipated what he saw. It was time as she slowly undressed. Her shirt rose higher with each passing minute and exposed the pale skin of her breasts. Her breasts, slightly larger than a B-cup, were capped off with large, dark brown areolas that pointed straight to her dark, erect nipples. It took her several minutes to lift her skirt, which came to mid-thigh and stopped at mid-thigh. He noted that she wore panties. He had already noted it, he noticed them before coming here.</p> <p>He stood and stripped down except for his boxers, never allowing his erection to escape its confines, to his obvious enjoyment. He took the hint and sat down.</p> <p>"So many questions. Do you have any ideas? I think this will be my first chance to tell the story so let me take you through a moment with something in mind," he said almost inaudibly to himself.</p> <p>She came back with a short list and the first six questions. Some were questions if she was able to make the journey along. Some were questions, like can I make her orgasm, can I be adventurous, make her feel like someone I love, if I've got it, and then I can start again anytime she wants it.</p> <p>He also wanted to hear her answer as an example and made her respond by kissing each finger.</p> <p>"As I said, the first few questions are about experience, but you may learn if you are patient enough. If you are quick, I may even do something more fun. Your answers may be easy, though, as far as asking for help?</p> <p>"You have a question but you can wait for the right moment." He waited and waited as she got the last word out.</p> <p>"How do I make her orgasm?" she wondered. He waited patiently as he finished her off. After an hour he had to leave her to work the night shift.</p> <p>"I guess I could try."</p> <p>"Why not, you might as well."</p> <p>She finished with her list and came back with another question to ask. The second question was simple. "Who do I have to tell off?" She was nervous and wondered if he would have time to play his part for her.</p> <p>"I would suggest that you give this to someone who you know knows how to give me a blow. You already know the answer, so let's give it to someone I like and you can also give a friend a sample of what's to be."</p> <p>"What's that?"</p> <p>"Well, it's what I like. If I like someone like this, I won't mind."</p> <p>She had a thought. "What are you going to do if I like it? What do I do?"</p> <p>"You'll have to show me."</p> <p>"Okay, but this isn't anything I've done before. I haven't even kissed a girl. Can I show you what to use?"</p> <p>"Sure, I'm listening."</p> <p>She unbuttoned and unzipped her pants, then unzipped her own pants, pulling them down, bending over to reveal panties, which she quickly rolled back up. She was wearing a thong. He admired it.</p> <p>"So, I'll give this a try. I know some people like it that way and we can try it out one other time before you have to leave work."</p> <p>"What kind of a woman has that?" She asked.</p> <p>"For instance, one who's a virgin."</p> <p>He smiled and agreed to that question.</p> <p>"No," he stopped her, holding to her as she tried to pull away. "No, let go. I'm asking, not asking. Let's take this step at the start."</p> <p>Her hand came up to his, she ran her hand down the front. "Not so firm," she noted.</p> <p>"Sorry, I'm just not used to being touched there."</p> <p>"Me neither," she said and took his hand.</p> <p>"What if I said 'How do I make her orgasm?'" she asked as she stroked down the front of his shorts, noticing his erection already growing.</p> <p>"You can go in and start there, honey." He could hear his voice. "I could have a few minutes."</p> <p>"Well, I know just what you would like," she said. "We have no problem getting this started."</p> <p>"Well, you have fun at the end," he called over her shoulder and took a long drink of his drink.</p> <p>She sat with him, taking her time to enjoy all of his attention. When she felt ready and told him of herself, he leaned over and kissed herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
