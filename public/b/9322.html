"I got caught on something."</p> <p>"You were caught." Her tone was sharp.</p> <p>"I'm not."</p> <p>"You had to. I wasn't wearing panties!" She was a little self conscious about how much she was showing.</p> <p>"I know." I tried to backpedal, but I didn't get very far.</p> <p>"I didn't mean to take them off." I tried to stay calm but she looked furious.</p> <p>"You can't."</p> <p>"Yes I can."</p> <p>What her tone implied meant so much to me.</p> <p>Her legs started shaking, and I knew I was probably in for a fight. My dick was getting hard, and I wanted to throw my blanket and go get laid, but we had already crossed the line. My thoughts were going to explode, and soon enough.</p> <p>"I didn't mean to take off my panties," I offered, trying to hold her down.</p> <p>"No." She leaned over and pushed herself even closer to me, and I could see her body in all her bare beauty. "Not until you stop calling me your sister."</p> <p>"But I do." It took me a while to figure out what she wanted, but eventually, I did it.</p> <p>"You can't," I pleaded. "You've got to stop." I couldn't go out there, and she knew it. "Please, I can't do this."</p> <p>"Not yet," she whispered, and when she did, we locked in a deep, passionate kiss. She ran a hand up my leg and gave it two quick squeezes before her hand moved into my shorts, grabbing my cock.</p> <p>"What're you doing?" I started to say, but she kissed me again, and that didn't help.</p> <p>"I can't." I was so surprised, but I couldn't argue. I could tell by the way her lips were pressed against mine, that she was still teasing me. I was so wound up, yet so turned on. And I couldn't deny how hard my cock was throbbing, despite how much I wanted to stay there with her.</p> <p>I was on fire, and she knew it.</p> <p>"I'm not going to give you a choice, you horny little slut."</p> <p>"You're making me angry!" I pushed my hands under her arms so her breasts were against me.</p> <p>"I think I should do something about you." I couldn't help but groan at how quickly all this started to change us. "I know you want to fuck me, but I don't. I'm not going to break you up or ruin your relationship. And I'm not going to do anything about that right now." Even the last sentence went through my head.</p> <p>"Then what is wrong with you?"</p> <p>"I didn't mean to do this." I didn't know what to say, and it was hard to think about her talking to me about sex while I was just a silly nerd. "I just don't know how."</p> <p>"You're a good boy aren't you," she smiled up at me, and I couldn't think of anything else to say. "And you're hard as a rock. Come on and fuck me. Make me cum."</p> <p>I didn't think it was possible for us to have sex without being sexually involved, but somehow, that was the way that our relationship should have gone. She wanted to fuck, and I wanted to fuck. And I had the perfect excuse to be that way, even if it was kind of a bad combination.</p> <p>"No, I'm not." I didn't answer right away, but quickly put my hand to her mouth.</p> <p>"Mm," she moaned as my fingers tangled her hair and she opened her mouth wide. "Then you're not going to cum."</p> <p>"But you did that when we started dating, right?"</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"I mean, we've been trying to be discrete with each other and that was hard to do. We never kept secrets. And the first time I had sex while looking at you in the shower, I thought about doing it again with you." I couldn't help but smile.</p> <p>"Is that right?" She put one of her feet on my leg, and pushed herself closer to me. Her thigh touched my cock, and it felt good. "Is it wrong?"</p> <p>"Of course not." She ran a hand down my chest, and her fingers were just touching the top of my briefs, but something inside of me stopped me. "I want you so bad," she whispered. "I want you in me."</p> <p>"You'reâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
