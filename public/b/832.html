I felt the cool air on the soles of my feet, which were still warm from my earlier activities. The feeling was exquisite and I had yet to experience its full meaning.</p> <p>"You don't need this," I said as I turned around, looking over my shoulder, "you're not going to regret the next few days." I gave her a quick kiss on the cheek, "that's the way of the world." I turned to the left, to where we could see the pool and several others in their various stages of undress. I turned back around, "I'll take you up there with me."</p> <p>"I don't doubt it," she said, "but I really can't drive for at least another hour." I gave her a kiss that was a little more forceful than her usual. "This is the safest place I've had a car since I bought it the other night. Are you driving?"</p> <p>I had no idea she was driving and I took her hand and raised it to my lips. "No, I'm not. I just drove for a little while, if need be."</p> <p>"That's great too," she chimed in, "so do you have to go now?"</p> <p>I nodded a 'go' and held out my arms. "There isn't any rush so it shouldn't take long."</p> <p>"Thank you, you're very kind, Mark." I heard a little squeal as her body brushed up against mine and felt her nipples brushing my bare chest. I reached up and pulled the straps off her shoulders, releasing the wonderful tits they had only recently been confined to a small bra. She tossed it to the side as soon as that had happened, and grabbed my hand, pulling it to her tit. I had almost missed the action; I could feel the nipple and the curve of her areola through the fabric.</p> <p>"We should probably get these off before the fun just gets much better." She pulled me up onto her, kissing me with a slow passion, as my lips left hers, my hands moved from her shoulders to the small of her back. She reached a hand down and felt the material of her thong; they weren't very damp.</p> <p>"I'd give them to you myself but this just seems so damn...dirty." As she spoke, she pulled me to her and dropped to her hip in a very awkward fashion. My cock came to life at that moment, and I knew I wouldn't last too much longer.</p> <p>We made our way across the shallow end of my pool, each of us getting a little more exposed each time. The cool water felt fantastic as it hit her skin as she bent and spread her legs. She kept her hands on the edge of the pool in order to hold onto it as she walked.</p> <p>I stopped to admire her as she continued to move from side to side, showing off my appreciation. We made our way back towards the bar, our eyes locking as she came up from behind, "Have a seat," she ordered. She had pulled her blouse off, and by the time I had sat down in a bar stool, her breasts were barely covered as she moved her body over me, her full breasts pressing against me. My cock became rock solid as I was staring at my woman, watching the muscles in her back ripple as she moved her torso, her nipples grazing against my chest. I reached for her, she grabbed my hand, pulling it towards her tits as she moved my hand over her body, squeezing the nipple and caressing the side of her breast.</p> <p>"Do you trust me?" She said, as she pulled my hand. She had no bra on, and my cock swelled as my hand slid over her smooth skin.</p> <p>"Yes," I found myself saying.</p> <p>"Yes what?" She asked, as she brought my hand down gently to her stomach.</p> <p>"Yes," I said, the breath coming out in a moan. We stayed like that for a moment, looking into each others eyes as she moved my hand down to the base of her waist. She leaned against me, letting me play with the fabric of her thong.</p> <p>"You can stop if you'd like," she whispered, "but I don't care." As our eyes met, I knew she was thinking about how she would do this. I slid my hand down her stomach to her pubic hair; she stopped me before I reached her pussy. "No, I can't feel for certain."</p> <p>"I'm wet already." As she said it, she spread her legs apart slightly. I moved my fingers down to her lips as she continued to look at me.</p> <p>"What about me?" she asked. I shook my head.
