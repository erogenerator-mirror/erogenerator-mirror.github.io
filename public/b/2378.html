Once there she began sucking on it, kissing it all the way down. When her hair came up it tickled my balls, and I found myself leaning up against the couch as I groaned. She took her finger away, and I thought she was going to get serious, but instead she straddled my waist. With her fingers she held the base of my cock and guided it into her dripping pussy.</p> <p>Now, I was going to tell you my cock was not as soft as it was before, and not so much of that was wasted. It didn't get much better, just as far as I was concerned. She pushed down, her hips bumping on mine, her hands supporting herself. Not only did I not mind that I was still rock hard, I also didn’t mind that it was still big as she was. “Now, I’m going to fuck you.”</p> <p>Her mouth returned to my cock, sucking out a trail of precome. I leaned up, giving her more room. I felt her cunt clench around me. I lifted my hips off the couch, trying to be gentle as she clamped even tighter around me. She began fucking my cock even as hard and fast as I was fucking hers.</p> <p>And fuck did she ever clench. At first it only squeezed me a little, then it began to loosen. If any sort of rhythm had been created for her, it was not just the feeling of the tightness around me. It was pure pleasure. She rode me slowly, almost as if she was milking me, and then she began bouncing again. Her moans rose in volume. I looked up at her, our faces wet and flushed, and I reached up to hold both of her wrists in my hands. She smiled, as I did so, and I pulled them back together with my arms.</p> <p>I kept a firm grip of her upper arms, my cock still buried in her, when I felt her begin moaning once more. She started screaming, a deep growl, which soon began to become a high-pitched, low-pitched moan. A cry came as she came, a primal orgasm. Her entire body was rigid. A series of moans rose, and then stopped. I was a bit embarrassed at my actions, but I didn’t stop. I could still feel her cunt gripping around my cock and I thought she might have another orgasm.</p> <p>This orgasm, it took only moments, and seemed to last only as long as it ended. Then it began to go on and on, as I pounded into her, harder and harder. She screamed with each orgasm, each of which was accompanied by a long groan of pleasure which was almost too much. I had never seen her like this, especially given the noise she was making.</p> <p>Finally, it ended, and she collapsed onto my chest, my cock still buried in her. She lay there for a moment and looked at me. “I don’t ever want to leave the house again.”</p> <p>I didn’t even respond. I kissed her forehead, her cheek, her neck for a moment, and then she rolled off the couch.</p> <p>She lay next to me, her hair still damp from where it was messed up. She ran her fingers through my hair. “Was it good for you?”</p> <p>I kissed her on the nose. “I’m not quite sure.” I knew. “It was the best thing either of us had ever done.”</p> <p>Her fingers moved down to my chest, her fingers caressing my nipples, as she pulled me into a kiss. “Thank you.”</p> <p>“I’m grateful.”</p> <p>“You’ve done more than anyone could have imagined.” A sly grin crossed her lips. “There’s more to come.”</p> <p>I looked at the clock, still wondering whether we should get home.</p> <p>When we finally did get home, she got off the couch and came to me. Kissing me, she got me to undress me. Once she had me naked she said, “I don’t want to wait anymore.”—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
