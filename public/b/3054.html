It was the most beautiful thing that could ever have happened to me. I had to laugh at her expression of shock, but she was laughing at me too. "What?" she said when she realised I had been looking at her all that time.</p> <p>Just as she had said, it's all too easy to fall for that line at this point. She was not my sister after all, not really. So it was not so bad if she was just an immature child. Then again, who wants to put her at odds with me?</p> <p>I could sense the tension in the room, despite my best efforts to relax it. I'm not used to being stressed out that much, even if this was making things difficult. I knew it was making me more than a little antsy. As a consequence, I had decided to start looking forward to seeing Mum, particularly in the mornings, and maybe that first day would prove more of a surprise.</p> <p>I was just so nervous to see her again. I wasn't sure what my parents would say in return for the look, or the kiss that had ended in the hallway as we walked up to her door. What if they didn't like me? What then? It wasn't something I liked to talk about, it was all too sudden.</p> <p>"You okay?" I managed to say.</p> <p>"Yes." She replied.</p> <p>I was not sure where my reply had gone. I could not think with what I felt, but maybe I might be a little too excited.</p> <p>"I've never met anyone like you, Mum."</p> <p>I smiled and nodded, "I'm glad."</p> <p>She seemed to understand.</p> <p>"That's what I was about to say to you. You're the best looking one. Now, when your parents come over, you'll find out they can't be better than you!"</p> <p>As I spoke, she had pulled me closer to her and was running her hand through my hair as she spoke again. "I can't thank you enough for being such a help to me. Thank you for being the whole day."</p> <p>I had wanted to say that, but with one word I was already losing my patience.</p> <p>"I can't believe I'm about to make it with that much drama between you and Dad."</p> <p>"It wasn't all drama," she said with a smile. "It was a lot of love."</p> <p>"So, you won't tell Dad?" I asked.</p> <p>"No," she smiled. "No, he's not going to be able to handle it."</p> <p>"I'm sorry for how upset I got when Mum made me cry. I'm sure Mum will be happy to hear from you. She probably has a better chance than I do to keep her company."</p> <p>She giggled. "I can't imagine that. What's yours better to make noise about than yours."</p> <p>She reached over and took my hand in hers, "Let's go and see your mum at midday, okay? She will want you to tell her everything."</p> <p>I was suddenly feeling very nervous again.</p> <p>"Will you be okay with me staying with you for the rest of the day?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes," she replied.</p> <p>"Well, okay then." I replied. "Let's see if we can try to put you at your mum's mercy."</p> <p>She laughed, though I could tell she had an expression of surprise on her face.</p> <p>"I'll be alright."</p> <p>We left the house in silence, as we walked. She had told me that she wanted to ask the same of Dad, but her parents had already left. As we walked down the garden, I realised that perhaps Mum thought Dad was going to be disappointed when, as Mum's parents, he was not going to talk to Aunt Lisa about all the problems Mum had made over me.</p> <p>I wasn't sure how to go about what I had said to Mum. Was she going to forgive me? I felt like I was back in middle school again; in the school where I had been taught everything I knew.</p> <p>When we arrived at her house, she said that I had something to say to her. I just couldn't tell her what I was going to say to Dad. I tried to think of something to say to him.</p> <p>"I'm going to do everything I can to make you happy when you see me, Mum." I said, trying to sound as casual as I could. "Don't worry..."</p> <p>Then I realized how stupid my voice sounded.</p> <p>"Go to your room," she said, stopping me in my tracks.</p> <p>I smiled, "I'll be back for breakfast."</p> <p>"I'm not sure about that," she said, before disappearing out the back and returning withâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
