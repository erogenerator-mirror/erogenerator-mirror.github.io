While I was there, I had no idea what to do. I went back several times to check the bathroom, but the door shut automatically as I had when I was trying to take a piss, but that's beside the point. I got a sense of a sort of déjà vu all over.</p> <p>Now, there's your thought process; this wasn't exactly my thought process. However, while my mind was making logical sense, my body was making all kinds of contradictory mental plans. I thought about all of the possibilities to come and the possibilities to come.</p> <p>My mind drifted back to the previous evening.</p> <p>As I walked along the back yard of our neighbor's house, I thought back to that moment in the bar. We had just got engaged, that one of those drinks, that one of those dances was all but done. But, at the same time, I had been watching my ex-wife, watching her, even while she fucked all of that guy friends that I was a part of. My mind was on the way to the bathroom, then back in there, thinking about how those drinks had all made my own wife feel.</p> <p>I was on my way home, when my thoughts returned to those night. I was still wearing that t-shirt when I felt the crotch and crotch of that same t-shirt that I had been wearing before. I opened my eyes, looking down to see what had taken me so long. I wondered if she had noticed it.</p> <p>As I pulled out my cock, my thoughts were starting to wander again. The thought of my wife with another guy went back in my head, maybe she had thought that way; maybe it got her into my bed, so she could have had a feel of my cock. Maybe she had. Was she jealous; I didn't know how I felt about my ex-wife's feelings for me. At the moment, I felt like I was jealous. All I could think was 'what am I going to do now, what can I do now?'"</p> <p>I stopped, just watching the road and how it went by, wondering how far I could go before I stopped at this point. I wasn't ready to drop it all, just not yet. I knew I should just go on and say nothing. But, the reality was still there. As long as the fantasy is good, as long as the fantasy stays good... then what was it?</p> <p>I didn't know where to go from there. My mind had been all over the place for the past hour and I did not know when I was going to stop her. So, I figured there was no going back.</p> <p>My mind was still on the erotic feelings she had for me. As I pulled in her driveway, I was wondering exactly how to go about it. If it is okay to see her, if it is fine to just go ahead. I was also wondering what her response was. I would do it without hesitation but, on some level she is more or less comfortable with the idea of being with a stranger.</p> <p>As long as it is safe, and I get no one's trouble, then it is okay to do it. As long as it is not inappropriate and if you see her and enjoy the moment, it is okay. Besides, there was no real harm in seeing each other, but it could go a little further. I felt I needed to let it go; she would have her space in the relationship if I didn't. I was sure she would go along with it. And, if she had, then I shouldn't have stopped her.</p> <p>So, I pulled in, closed the door, and went on into the house.</p> <p>The next morning was a Sunday. We did all of her work at home, as well as our front yard, except for the pool. We usually didn't use the outside pool; instead, it had that large hole at the end just above. There were a few things we would need in there but, for the lack of a better way, we used the pool on all our back yards and also used a hot tub in our backyard. In addition, we were all expected to clean up after ourselves and do our best to remove any fluids from wherever they might be.</p> <p>When Sunday Morning arrived, we both awoke and got up. We had just finished making love, and she was already up, wearing a robe and carrying some paper towels. She had turned to leave the bathroom when I saw what she had been doing, and I stopped her.</p> <p>"Hey, you didn't do anything do you little slut," I said in a sardonic tone of voice. While she was getting up, she started doing me.</p> <p>I had to admit to myself that she had done nothing more than bend over my—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
