I grinned back and said, "I hope so."</p> <p>As we walked, we chatted about her new office, her work load, what I was supposed to do with the new client's office. As we were getting to the office, I felt her hands lightly brushing over my ass and legs. "Merry Christmas, dear," she purred.</p> <p>In the office, I opened the blinds. The fire door was closed and I walked into the office to take in the warm night glow. She sat down and was rubbing my shoulders and I moved to give her a kiss. She turned to me and we kissed. I began to massage her shoulders and began to kiss my way down her neck down towards her chest, she cooed softly and grabbed my head to bring my mouth to her hardened nipples.</p> <p>"Oh God," she said, "You're a tease!" I laughed and she turned me around to unbutton my blouse. I had on a white, lace vest, so her hands found their way into the back of my bra and began to slowly massage my breasts. As she squeezed and rolled my nipples, I leaned back to her ear and whispered, "I have to confess I haven't been the only one to take your clothes off!" She put me in her arms and began kissing and licking my nipples over the smooth, silky material. I moaned and pressed my boobs towards her mouth, making her moan in return for more. I slid my skirt down as she had her blouse off, showing the top of my panties.</p> <p>As I stepped out of my skirt, I looked at the bulge in my panties and said, "Why don't you take your panties off?" she reached for them.</p> <p>"Okay," she said.</p> <p>She grabbed my panties and tugged on them, which brought a gasp from me. She pulled them off and laid them on the edge of the desk. "I'm happy to let you take them off," she leaned over and kissed me as she stepped into them. "Put them on right here," she asked. I did as she said and turned around, pulling my panties as she slid the thin fabric over my butt, and stood back up. "Turn around," she said and began unbuckling my pants. Quickly pulling my panties down, she pushed them out of the way and looked at me.</p> <p>"It's your birthday today, isn't it?"</p> <p>As I turned to face her, my lips touched her nipple, causing her to jump. "No," I said. "It's your birthday, too," and I began pulling her bra up as she helped me pull her panties off. Once my panties were off, we went over to the bed. I straddled her, my bare pussy inches from her face and she began to play with my nipples as I slid my hands around her neck. She pushed her up and into my pussy, which caused me to begin moaning. She slipped a finger between my lips and into my vagina and began to rub against my clit.</p> <p>She asked, "Are you ready to get in the mood?" I smiled and nodded. So she slid her lips up the side of my neck, to my ear, nibbling on my earlobe. She moved her lips up to my ear and whispered, "When you're ready to cum, we'll go from here." She kissed the side of my face and licked her lips, making them glisten and made me tremble with anticipation. I reached for her breasts and began to gently knead and pinch her nipples as I felt her legs wrap around mine. She slid me down onto the bed and lifted me up so I was lying between her open thighs. "Merry," she whispered, "Are you ready"? My heart beat against my lips as she looked me in the eyes and I nodded yes. "Then get in, sweet. Let's see if we can hold back." With that, she leaned over and kissed me.</p> <p>I looked into her eyes again, my own in a daze of anticipation. I lay back on the bed and spread my legs. "Okay," she whispered, "Are you ready"?</p> <p>"I think so," I said.</p> <p>I grabbed my panties and pushed them into my slit as she sat up into the bed next to me. She lay on her back and spread her legs. I looked at her intently as I ran my fingers up and down her slit, making sure she was ready without pushing her over the edge. She placed both of her hands on her breasts and squeezed them as I ran my fingersâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
