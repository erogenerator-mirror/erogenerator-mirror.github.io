As her thoughts went back on over and over again, she thought about the day's events. As she thought about how they could help her in some way, she could feel her pussy start to tingle in response. It had been a very tense day.</p> <p>She had barely finished her coffee as she stood from the sink. She couldn't take all of the emotions that had been racing through her mind since she got up at 12:45. She had to get some answers. She needed answers. She picked up her coffee cup as she looked at her reflection in the mirror. She had put on some makeup for today. She decided against her dark mascara and decided to call it an 'over the rack' look. Her eyes had the same look of a woman of her age; she smiled as she pulled the long red hair into a ball and brushed it. She had just taken the lipstick out from her little bag and her lipstick was a deep red, it gave her the look of an older woman she had long ago become. Today would be hard work.</p> <p>As she pulled out her walk towards the front door, she could smell her cologne now; it wasn't that it was a scent of old money; it was a scent of her life that had just come from the store she had worked with in the summer and had taken from her for a 'thank you' card when she had walked in that day. She reached the end of the driveway and stepped onto the street. She didn't see anyone, but decided that this morning might be one of the longest days of her life so far. As she approached her little Fiat, she noticed that it was still in first class gear; it was still a convertible model. She reached into the back seat and pulled out a box of tissues and put them in her palm as she began to rub her thumb along the wetness between her thighs. She ran her fingernails along the line of her panties and down her thighs, over her knees, down to her calves and up the inside of her thigh as she ran her fingertips lightly along her inner thigh. The smell of her panties was strong and heady as she ran her fingernails along them, she could feel how sticky her panties, were getting, became wet. She felt the softness of her thighs as she ran her fingertips along them, she could feel her breathing increase. She ran one finger through the thinness of her panties, then slowly up to her clit, as she continued to rub her pussy. She felt herself getting wetter as her head lowered, her eyes closed and her mouth opened slightly as she moaned a little. The feeling of her skin sliding in and brushing against her finger felt wonderful. She continued to run her finger from the top of her lips to her clit, which began to swell almost immediately as she continued to rub her. She slid her finger further back, and up her ass, and began to circle her ass a little. As she slowly stroked her ass a finger slipped inside and she felt her insides go into spasm. She looked up at the house and noticed that her cell phone had disappeared. She smiled and quickly called a number.</p> <p>There was no answer. She left the phone up to one ear and left her door open so that some light from the street lights would be enough to reach her. She walked down the road, taking every step she had, and making the most of her day, as it wound down she called home to let her son in. They were both busy right now, but once he got home, he knew right off that he wanted to go on one of his long rides with that young woman, or at least, she was. They talked on the phone for a good hour.</p> <p>She knew he would love the idea of how the woman was getting ready to start dinner on that young man's stomach. They kept talking as they drove and she told him about her day and the events that must have taken place. He really enjoyed her telling him about that experience. He told her about the sex, that he came twice in the same day, and the way her face got flushed as she came. She told him of their trip to the gym and that she had a massage to get into, and a little wine. She went on to tell him the story about getting caught while masturbating on the treadmill. While she was telling him, he was telling her how much he loved her body. She was amazed that she could talk so long into an erection, while she had her hand over her mouth, and her chest was rising and falling with every breath. She could see her nipples starting to harden again, and her hand started to squeeze them. She really loved the feeling of the softness of her hands between her legs. He said he loved it when it was like that because it was so good to have someone else's handsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
