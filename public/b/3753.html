He looked over to the woman who gave off a sultry gaze and he was pleased to see her smile. She was dressed in an expensive looking dress that came down to her calves. He wondered if she was going to make a special request if she had her eyes opened this morning. She looked to be around forty.</p> <p>"I don't think so," the woman said. "He said you're the guest." She continued talking to her husband as she left the room and disappeared. He hoped there was something she wouldn't do if she were ordered to. He felt his cock grow even harder as he imagined her making her way into the room with him already naked. His cock gave a little jerk of anticipation as she stepped back out. This was exactly what he was hoping for. He was sure she would make herself available to a complete stranger if she was ordered to. He could still taste his semen in her mouth. As she walked towards him he began to wonder if she would be so accommodating after last night as she had been at the party last night. He hoped she would be as eager to serve him as she had been to his friend. She had given herself to him in ways a young bride might have only to wonder what the groom had dreamed last night. She had taken him, and then she had only to say yes to him. As she continued to look back at him he wondered just how much of this last night he had dreamt. After all he had been through with these two women, how would he be able to explain what they meant to him without having to explain it to the others? He felt he had to be honest with himself and admit it to the women about how he felt. He had felt it had been one experience and no other woman had done that to him. As long as he had had the women, he was sure that if nothing else had happened to him at the reception then he wouldn't have known how the night was going to develop. The night would have been special if he knew at least what it had been. And after all, he was on his hands and knees in that room with them. He hoped they had enjoyed themselves too. He imagined the room would be one of the most beautiful, sensual and hot couches in the room and that they would love it. He had always wanted to see them together as they had been this morning, to watch and be watched. He knew they would make love in the room where they had been joined before but now would be the lucky man who got to see this happen.</p> <p>She reached out to him and stroked his cheek before turning for him. He smiled as he looked up her body and saw she was still clothed. He hoped he had the strength to satisfy her before she left and maybe even take her in the arms again. But he knew one thing for certain. He loved having her wrapped around him. He didn't think about being her prisoner. He had seen what might happen to her the previous night and he loved that her body had betrayed her in all the places it had allowed his friend to. Perhaps she felt the same as she turned back to her husband, and if she did she wouldn't be betraying him. She could only hope.</p> <p>As he returned to his feet, he glanced down at his stiff cock. His mind flashed back to the night before. He could actually picture what would be about to happen to him as he lay bound to the bed. He couldn't believe he had let the young woman make that man cum. She had made him the same way he had seen her last night. But as he looked at the woman who had been his friend while he was still bound, could he even see her again?</p> <p>He looked over to the couple at the other side of the room. The woman was looking back through the glass pane of the bed frame. She was smiling at the woman who had caused the man to cum. He could almost get a dreamy look on his face as he wondered if she had also given herself to what she had been told would happen if his friend decided to have the same ceremony with her. Or she would just say yes. He couldn't wait.</p> <p>He stood there for a minute pondering what he should do next and wondering whether he should go to the man she had been talking to. The man with the cock in his hand was looking from the woman across the room at her husband. His cock stiffened even faster than it had before. His wife seemed to be enjoying his performance. How bad they could be right now. He stood there for a moment, thinking of the thought but then quickly dismissed the idea as well. He didn't want to hurt the woman's feelings. He wanted to make sure her husband wasn't hurt. He wanted to hold her when she cried. And he wanted to do this in front of the man she had been talking toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
