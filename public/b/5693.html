"You are one of my best customers."</p> <p>"It's the least I can do." I laugh.</p> <p>She walks over to the counter, reaches for my hand, and takes it, placing it gently on her naked breast, just under her collar, just below her nipple.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm glad to finally meet you; you have a beautiful family." I squeeze her breast gently and her nipples harden as I do.</p> <p>"Well, you are nice to me. I could never take my eyes off you" she replied, with a smile.</p> <p>"It's always nice to meet someone who is as beautiful as you," I answer. "It's also nice to work with people I care about at my shop, such as your friends, your husband, and your mother. Now I have to know who I can talk to about a special customer so that I can ask for a loan, if necessary."</p> <p>I go on to describe, as I can recall, a woman with a long blonde hair and a slim build. Her husband and son had been visiting family in Germany, and her daughter had just moved to California to be with her husband.</p> <p>"I have to work until next month, my family will be gone, so I'm free until then," she said. "Now who am I to keep your mouth shut?"</p> <p>I smile, "Hi, I'm Steve. I'll come in now, and help you. What can I do for you?"</p> <p>"Hi, I'm Susan, it's nice to meet you."</p> <p>As we sit down, and get out my cell phone, I see Susan dialing your family, and has to call your name. She hangs up, and then turns back to me "Thank you for helping me and your son," she says.</p> <p>"Susan, this is Mike and Jerry. We came to help you and your son when you were in the hospital. Susan is also helping us," my son says, taking it all in.</p> <p>"Hey, Mike, so I guess you've finally met Susan. You never told me your name. I guess I shouldn't tell you that your wife had been with you."</p> <p>"Mike, Jerry, hi, I'm sorry to interrupt this, but I was actually busy for the past few hours doing some things, and they all seem to be busy. If you can wait until tomorrow then, I can drive back now. I don't know if I can be free when Susan is here, I can't take all that time."</p> <p>"Well, I have to get back, I have to pick up some errands for my boss and a few friends, and I'll call you later in the day. I guess you can keep me company for now, maybe it'll give you some relief. Then you won't have to worry about me being mad about you leaving me, but I think I understand. Mike, Jerry, you get on with your life, it's a busy day for people like you."</p> <p>"Yeah, Mike," my son answers. "Let me know if this goes into a police matter. I'll catch up again tomorrow."</p> <p>"Thanks. I appreciate that."</p> <p>"Yes, you are welcome, and I've known for a long time that you were a bit of a prude."</p> <p>I smile at him, and lean down to give him a kiss.</p> <p>"What would you like for lunch this week?" I ask him. "It'll probably be some burgers, and something that's good for a man's stomach."</p> <p>"It's nothing to be a good host," he replies. "It's not that I don't enjoy coming here, it's just that it's a bit different than my city. I can just live on a very small and very public street, where anyone can just come over and see me."</p> <p>"Well," I say. "I'd like to see my son again sometime."</p> <p>"Are you serious about getting with your son again?" I ask. "I know just what to do in that field. Maybe you can bring your son to my office tomorrow for a little shopping."</p> <p>His face brightens, and he says, "I could really use a little of your help. This is a big deal for Mike, and I'll do anything you want to help him," he says, grinning like a Cheshire cat.</p> <p>"Oh, come on, I just couldn't do it myself," I say. "I am not a professional. Anything you want to do for help Mike is okay. I'll just drop by my office and get your son for you to comeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
