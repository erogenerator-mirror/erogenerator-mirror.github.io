He started to rub her butt cheek.</p> <p>"Not so fast, you big lug," Lisa stammered, "I'll do the rest."</p> <p>Dennis rolled her ass, massaging it with both hands, gently pulling on it. It felt so warm and soft. She squeezed it as he rubbed her cheek, pulling her cheeks further apart to give him easier access.</p> <p>"Mmmmm, that's nice," Lisa cooed. Dennis looked up at her, surprised by her language. "Yes, that's nice," he said. He gave her butt a quick squeeze. "I've never had my ass fingered," he said.</p> <p>Lisa blushed with embarrassment, even more so than she was. She knew that. "I'm not sure the other guys like me to be finger fucked," she replied.</p> <p>Dennis leaned over and kissed her mouth. "I guess, you're an expert."</p> <p>"That's my kind of girl," Lisa replied with a smile. He kissed her again, long and deep. She responded back with the same passion, slipping her tongue down his mouth and into his. When Dennis broke the kiss, he was stunned by how close she was to him. There was just no way that she was going to let him kiss her like that.</p> <p>Dennis looked at her a moment. "Are you sure?" He asked. He had seen her blush. He felt confused and afraid of her reaction. "Don't worry, you'll enjoy it, I promise."</p> <p>"No," she replied, looking down at his hands, "that's not what I meant. You're too young, anyway."</p> <p>"Don't be embarrassed, I won't be embarrassed," Dennis said, kissing her mouth again. After a second, he started to kiss her shoulders, neck and upper chest, moving down to her breasts. She started to react, as if she was getting warm down there, and didn't want him to stop.</p> <p>"Dennis, you shouldn't," Lisa said. She looked at him. "You really shouldn't." He moved his fingers down the front of her body, over the top of her panties, and into her pussy. She gave a sharp intake of breath at his touch.</p> <p>He stroked up her legs, rubbing the insides of her thighs. "Ahhhh...I've wanted you like this the longest. It feels lovely. Is it okay?"</p> <p>"Uh!" Lisa said, her eyes wide.</p> <p>"Come on, I'll do you all the way, just relax."</p> <p>"What should I do?" Lisa asked.</p> <p>"Just relax, please, let him touch you," Dennis said reassuringly. He was hoping it would feel that good.</p> <p>Lisa's head went back, feeling his fingers touch her pussy lips, sliding between them. She gave a little shiver.</p> <p>"I feel sooo good, you're so good, " she said quietly.</p> <p>Dennis' fingers found her entrance. Lisa gave a deep intake of air. He pushed his middle finger inside a little, feeling her slippery, moist cunt.</p> <p>"Oh! That feels good!" Lisa exclaimed as she felt his finger inside her. "It's so hot and moist," she moaned. The feelings were so erotic. She looked up at Dennis'. "This is really starting to feel good," she whispered.</p> <p>"Me too."</p> <p>She reached her right hand down where his fingers were stroking her slit. She started to rub herself. She closed her eyes and moaned. She could feel her pussy starting to tighten up. She started to let out a long, low moan.</p> <p>For a second, Dennis froze. That was as far as he was going to go. Lisa smiled as she saw her response. He leaned back from the table while she went on rubbing her clit. She felt the tension building again.</p> <p>"Don't stop! Please stop!"</p> <p>"Yes, I'll stop, " he replied.</p> <p>Lisa's body tensed up. "Please don't stop!" she gasped as she had been waiting. She squeezed her pussy lips together. Suddenly she felt as if she would burst out of her skin. She squeezed her eyes shut and let out a low moan.</p> <p>Dennis looked at her.</p> <p>"Ah-h-h-h!" Lisa was starting to orgasm.</p> <p>"Oh, please don't stop!" she groaned.</p> <p>Dennis leaned back. "You're close, too. You're breathing hard."</p> <p>Lisa's eyes rolled and she started to shake a little. "Just enjoy it," she said.
