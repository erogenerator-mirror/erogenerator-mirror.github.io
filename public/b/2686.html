"But I'm ready to work on it."</p> <p>"Oh you will love it, love!" he whispered. "I've got a great idea. Let's go inside and just relax. I want you to just lay back. I'll work around your neck. It's important you feel safe and secure, if it will help you with your marriage."</p> <p>When we got inside of the lounge the first thing he and I had to do was make some room on the chair. He handed me a bottle of oil and a condom. As I was undressing for him with both my eyes wide in apprehension, I saw that he was watching me, while he had his cock in his hand and a huge, bulging tent in the front of his jeans. He put the condom on and moved closer to me. "Open your eyes," he whispered.</p> <p>I opened my eyes and saw that the man was watching me and getting hard. I was shocked at my reaction, but it came quickly.</p> <p>"What are you looking at?" he whispered. "Don't be ashamed. It's alright. We're both adults here."</p> <p>I wasn't really feeling as comfortable as I should be, but this was the only thing that I could do. He began to rub me. The man was hard, and the muscles in his groin were pulsing. His cock was pulsing against his thigh as it got harder. He leaned down, and I felt his tongue lick the pre-cum off the head. His hand felt great, and it seemed to me that at this time in his life, he had touched others to stroke and stroke. The man, on his knees between my legs, was also hard. This was the first time I had ever had a cock to play with, and I had never had a cock before.</p> <p>I felt like the woman in the movie, though not in that way. This was the first and not the last time I had ever felt like this. He had his mouth on me, and the skin of his face was like velvet. I had to have him all to myself.</p> <p>"Don't be embarrassed. I'm just going to enjoy this," he whispered in my ear. "That's all this is really about," he laughed. "Everything else gets to you."</p> <p>Then he moved his face back to me and kissed me. It had the most wonderful feeling I had ever have as this man kissed my lips tenderly and his tongue explored the inside of my mouth. His hands reached out and found mine; then I felt my fingers wrap around his and that wonderful warmth that I always wanted but never found.</p> <p>He broke off the kiss and looked at me with pure lust in his eyes.</p> <p>"We're not just going to have sex," he whispered in my ear, "we're going to have a very sensual and intimate time together." He kissed my lips again and caressed my nipples. I felt something soft and warm touching the head of my cock.</p> <p>"Please," I moaned.</p> <p>My eyes were closed as I felt his warm breath on the head of my cock and the lips, tongue and teeth of his mouth. I felt the softness of his lips; and soon it was like I'd been kissed by a thousand kisses. The kiss was soft and gentle and delicious in its own way, like it could make me climax at any time and if I didn't get it right, the first would be the last. I felt his hand caressing the base and pulling me back against his mouth as he sucked and licked my balls. It just felt so right. I was getting the same kind of wonderful feeling that my wife did as I reached out and caressed the back of his head before going on and on. I'd never been this way before; never had I been this horny and aroused. Soon I was in heaven! Here was this beautiful man sucking my cock, with his hand playing with my balls, and playing with his very soft and tender lips and tongue. And the feelings were fantastic!</p> <p>I opened my eyes and looked to see my lover on top of himself, taking the man's cock in his mouth as he continued to pleasure the man with his mouth and hands. All I could see was all that white-hot skin in the dark and his muscles as he flexed and pumped.</p> <p>It was as if he was a living person, a part of his anatomy.</p> <p>As I continued to have my eyes closed enjoying the erotic warmth of the moment, I watched him taking my cock all the way into his mouth. He took me deep into his mouth and then I felt his lips on the base of my cock, while his hand caressed my balls.
