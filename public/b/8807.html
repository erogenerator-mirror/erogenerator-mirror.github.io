So you really are not just talking about the weather?"</p> <p>"No, I'm kidding," he said. "It was a warm day...so nice to be able to get a hold of our own weather."</p> <p>"Yes...it was an unusual day, you know?"</p> <p>"Yes, it was indeed...and it seemed to be quite good.</p> <p>After we finished our beers and sat down at the table to talk, I spoke to him again about his experiences.</p> <p>"I am sorry to hear about your divorce," he said, "but I have a question about how you are going to handle an affair with another guy when you're not on the clock? You seem to be quite well off..."</p> <p>And that's where he ended up, at least for the moment.</p> <p>"Yes, I am sure, honey," I said. "You know, I've been asking myself that before...the very next night as we were having a beer at the bar. I am not sure you understand, you know...but I don't think you can handle it, you know..."</p> <p>I could see from his expression that he wasn't going to make it easy. And I didn't blame him for saying it. I had to say something, but only as a warning. I knew something I had to say, and I had to have one, too.</p> <p>"OK, then, let's get this party started!" I said.</p> <p>We had all gathered in the back corner of the crowded bar, the tall high ceiling made it more bearable, but we stayed at a near-ceiling and stood back to watch the party in progress.</p> <p>He took a sip of his beer, and looked up at me.</p> <p>There was no need for me to make the first move. This guy must have known something about me...and I could tell from the way he was looking at me that something good happened just then. I didn't need to think twice. I slid off my stool, grabbed the nearest empty spot, and sat down. He made no effort to go as me, even giving me a quick peck on the cheek for my trouble.</p> <p>I turned away and started to walk to the other end of the bar. I had put my hands high on the rail, so that my skirt barely went above my waist.</p> <p>"It's time," I said. "We are only getting started."</p> <p>And as it turned out, there were no more people to meet the way I had wanted. I was about to turn around to leave and leave but his hand stopped me and pulled me back to his lips.</p> <p>I froze. I had to do something. He didn't stop and he didn't push me off the bar...instead he held his hand over my crotch until I decided that I had had enough. I turned back to face him and kissed him full on the lips, and then backed him toward the men's room.</p> <p>"Wait for me in the men's room," I said, "and then we will go!"</p> <p>He looked at me like I had suddenly gone mad. I knew it was coming. I wanted it to happen.</p> <p>"You don't come in here, do you?" he said.</p> <p>"No, I'm not...not going anywhere," I said. And I don't know if its the first time I have said it, but I meant it. I meant it.</p> <p>The other patrons in the women's room were all older than I was, both attractive and unattractive. So far, my choice of venue was the bathroom, or the men's room. But when I stood up on the urinal with the door just ajar, I had to take a step. I had to. I leaned against the door, breathing heavily.</p> <p>"Wait," I said.</p> <p>He moved closer to me. I was a little nervous but as he held me at arm's length, I could feel my pussy getting wet again.</p> <p>"Don't do it here, honey," he said. "We will be fine. I will handle this."</p> <p>"All right, sweetheart. Take off your skirt. It will make it easier."</p> <p>He took the skirt from my hands and draped it around his neck. He reached down and took my hand and led me out of the restroom and to a separate stall in the stall next to mine. It was the only one with a door. And it was pretty dark, too.</p> <p>I opened the doors and stepped in and closed the door. When I turned toward him, he took my free hand and turned me around. He took my face in his hands and kissedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
