"You just wanted to see if it could go any higher?"</p> <p>"Oh! That's right," she laughed. "I was a little curious at first if you could go even further with me. Do you know where we are?"</p> <p>"No, we are in town, about three hours from campus, but we don't have a room. Do you want me to show you around? I can be there in less than an hour," he asked.</p> <p>"No, I'll be here," she said. "I've got a little time before I have to get ready so I'll be there as quick as possible. Let's go, please"</p> <p>They left the restaurant and headed out of town and onto the highway. They got out of the car and she followed closely behind. As they drove, she felt him begin to stiffen in his seat. "It's almost time," she said. Looking over at him, she saw his eyes were closed and he breathed quietly.</p> <p>"Come on, let me get a feel of that gorgeous ass of yours," he said to her. She hesitated. "I'm not that kind of guy," she said.</p> <p>"Oh no," he replied. "It's just a little hard to concentrate on the road. Let me touch you again," he said and moved his hand over her bare arm. She let out a little laugh. He continued to move his hand over her side. He kept moving his hand up her chest, up under her t-shirt and over her bra, where he moved his fingers to her nipple and gently touched her. She felt her own nipples stiffen against his touch and she sighed again, as she turned just a little to face him. He let his fingers slide under the shoulder loop of her bra and across the other boob. His eyes were closed, with an upward look in his eyes. "It seems you approve of my touching you?" he whispered.</p> <p>"Yes." she said. "You don't mind if I let you touch me back there?"</p> <p>"No, I love touching you. And I'm not gay."</p> <p>"Oh," she said. "I suppose I'm just a little inexperienced when it comes to the area of sex."</p> <p>"No, I think it's a beautiful area." He reached his hand under her t-shirt and began to caress her bare skin. He moved his hand back to her upper thigh, just inches away from her wet pussy lips. As she did so, he moved his mouth over to her ear. "Does that feel good?"</p> <p>"It is wonderful," she said and pushed her hand behind his head and pulled him up to kiss him on the lips. Their lips parted and she slowly opened his jacket to caress and caress his naked chest and neck and shoulders. She slipped her other hand under his t-shirt and up over his naked belly and over his now rigid cock. She could feel it hard against her and moved her hand over his chest and belly. They broke their kiss long enough to take their hands from each other and undo their jeans. She moved her hand across his leg until she felt the base of his cock. She moved a hand along the side of his cock and found he was still hard enough to get it up in the front if he moved it around more. She felt him take one leg between hers and then turned and straddled him. She slid her pelvis down so they were pressed against each others naked pussies. The feeling of feeling him and having him so close to her was electrifying and she moaned as he put his hand on her hip and brought her down to him. He pulled off his t-shirt and dropped his pants and underwear. She felt his erection against her vagina. She was thrilled when he lifted her shirt up to her shoulders, raised her arms and began to rub her breasts back and forth across his chest. She was feeling incredibly sexual. She moved her pelvis to take him in so that her pussy would slide along his hard cock. Their breathing was synchronized. He slipped his hands up her sides and slid his hands up until he had the bottom of her t-shirt. Slowly he began to lift it up. He made it easy for her to remove her shirt. When he sat up, her shirt fell forward over him and over her head. She was now totally nude.</p> <p>"Oh, that's lovely. I like that you took off your shirt," he said as he stroked her hair and face. He reached up and pulled the strap of the bra off her shoulder, freeing each breast. He felt it slide across his palm. Then his eyes met hers. He slowly brought his hand downward and began to stroke one of her nipples. It was stiff with excitement. He ran his fingertips along her areoles and then down over the edge of her breast to her nipple. He cupped herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
