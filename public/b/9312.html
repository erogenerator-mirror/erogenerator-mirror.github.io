The last few times I had cummed was just barely enough to last, and that was the first time I had cummed so hard.</p> <p>I was getting close to cumming myself. When I pulled in to the bathroom I let out a long sigh and flopped open the shower head. When I looked at my self for the last time I could see my juices and it mixed with the spray. I didn't even think of my orgasm going off yet, I just took what I could get. I washed my face, then my hair and dried it. I stepped out of the bathroom and dried off and looked at myself in the huge mirror. I was naked and my nipples and pussy were standing out as if I was naked. I dried my hair, and wrapped it in a towel. I went back into the living room and put on some soft white lounge pants and a big, fluffy, fluffy white T.</p> <p>I picked up my beer and sat down. As I drank it and took a sip I thought about that day on the computer. I hadn't been to a gym in years and there was nothing but exercise here. I started to think about my little "date." I had been on the computer researching online things that might make me a very sexy young woman. When it came to porn I had used it. I had gotten a lot of information, then started to feel frustrated when I was with other guys. I had even watched porn before, but had no idea that I could be into that much.</p> <p>I had tried for years to be comfortable with my body but with what I was now getting I wasn't getting the same kind of responses from guys. I had started to think that with what I had learned in life I could make great porn, but it wasn't going to happen. I couldn't see myself with men and men weren't going to make me into a cocksucker. I had wanted to please men, and now I wanted to be a cocksucker too.</p> <p>In an effort to make myself more comfortable I decided that I needed to do something about my cock. I went over there on the computer and typed on an account under my alias "Cocksucker" that I had been working on for the last several days. I had written it online for the first time. I typed some notes, then wrote a quick note that spelled out my first names as Jack, and I had written that name under one of the men I felt was my first true name. I had written my first name "Cocksucker" down. I thought what if I was to change my name? It would take away my new name. What if the old name got changed to something else? What if I was just another name. What if I just called the guy I had just written my name for me? All this seemed pretty ridiculous, but then, I hadn't written my first name. Why would I write up another name like that?</p> <p>Maybe I should just change my name. Maybe I should leave it the way it was. What if she had changed it to another cock name? Maybe I am not a cocky little slut, but if she was my first name. I didn't know but it was a sure sign of a woman doing it. Maybe I should just change it to a number of different names. I had tried the internet and there were lots of them. There were lots of the same things with different computer versions; I had tried all my versions. Maybe I could do with a new name. As this thought played across my thoughts they started to become clearer.</p> <p>When I sat down at the computer, I was sure that I was doing something wrong. For the first time I thought of the idea of a girl using a woman's first name. It was a different kind of thinking, it really wasn't my first thought, it was a female's first name. But then I looked down the list of names and thought back to the last few years and I had decided that it would be OK.</p> <p>I began to think that maybe I was crazy. I tried to think of the last woman on the planet that I had been with before meeting my first name. I wanted to try my new name. I wanted to be a cocksucker. I couldn't believe that this woman I had been having sex with was just a cock sucker. I tried to think how many cocks I could have had. The thought of losing my marriage and my reputation as a cock sucker just wouldn't work with that.</p> <p></p> <p>The first part of my story had been written as a story that started about a couple who had a threesome that happened out of state. My wife kept me informed to what they had, she didn't know why. There wasn't anything in the story that I hadn't shared with her. The wife had had several men before me, one after, two maybe three. She had been very satisfied with me.
