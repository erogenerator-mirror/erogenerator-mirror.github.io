He could see it all in those clouds, the city lights, the big buildings and the small buildings below. He couldn't really see much around him, other than the few people. Then he saw a group of people sitting in a small group of chairs. They looked like some kind of club. They had long black hair, which looked like it had been dyed short when Logan was just taking a leak. He didn't have to be a city street walker to know some people in these clubs were all of the same people. He could see that these people had a big, burly, muscular man in his 80s. He also made eye contact with another man who matched up to the tall, well-built man next to him. The man wasn't as tall as his fellow workers, and the two men were really good looking.</p> <p>The man seemed to be the leader of some type. He looked to be about 40 years old and very fit. He was probably on the football team. At that point, Logan wanted the city police to bust this pervert. He had to do something. And the city police would, for that matter. As he scanned through the crowd he could see that people were talking excitedly to the people at his window. After watching for a moment, they moved towards the man next to him. The short man was wearing a blue suit, which he seemed to be in some kind of uniform. He seemed to be wearing a hoodie and dark blue pants. Then he moved closer to two women with black hair. They appeared to be in their late thirties. They had long, dark brown hair and a pretty, petite face. He wasn't that big, but he had the body of a man most of the time. He was the only member of this club who appeared to have any interest in him, other than taking a leak, of course. Now everyone seemed to want the same girl next to him.</p> <p>He looked over at the big woman, who wasn't wearing anything but her bra and panties now, and thought that this might be a good place. He reached over and touched her shoulder. She was wearing a very short, tight black skirt. It was cut very low and appeared to be made of black material. It came down almost to her ankles. The skirt hung down just right over her right ankle when she was standing. Her long legs were bare, and he liked what he saw when he was looking at her. Her feet were bare, too.</p> <p>Logan's eyes took it all in. It was going to be an interesting evening.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>Logan didn't realize that people were talking outside his window until he turned around in his mind's eye. It made him nervous at what everyone was going to say to him. A man moved close to him, taking his hand, and he looked at the man. The man looked nothing like the man he worked for. A man wearing his uniform looked to be about 30 years of age, with dark hair and eyes of an African color. He had a short, thin frame, which he really showed off with his uniform. He appeared to be about six feet tall and not fat, but at least a little over 260 pounds. He looked very muscular and didn't flaunt it by making you think he could make your life hell.</p> <p>"Oh, hi. Logan, this is my girlfriend, Lisa." The woman, Lisa, introduced herself as Lisa.</p> <p>Logan glanced toward the man's eyes, not believing what he was seeing. He looked a little scared, but he wasn't about to take any chances. He looked at Lisa's brown eyes and he knew that she looked pretty like Lisa. He was pretty sure that it wasn't a boyfriend, but it was a girlfriend. Then he saw that the man's eyes were filled with desire, and Logan couldn't help but stare. When he looked again, the man's eyes were still looking Logan at the window.</p> <p>Logan looked at Lisa and saw that the man was still staring at him, the look on her face was intoxicating. He was still staring at Lisa's eyes, and he could tell that she was still holding those same kind of things that a man looks into his eyes, and she didn't seem to be noticing the other man's interest in him. Maybe they could both use the time alone. It wouldn't even take long, and they could walk over to the men on the other side of the street, and if he was lucky they would get to know him very well, Logan thought.</p> <p>"Well, are you going to watch her? I'm not really looking to talk to you." Logan was feeling pretty pissed. The man was looking directly at Logan now. It made Logan feel like a jackass.
