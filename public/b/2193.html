It was a lot bigger than when I had seen it jutting straight from my body right between my legs, and it was still getting hard once more. I watched as he took it in hand and began to stroke it up and down, the skin tight and smooth with veins all over.</p> <p>He then moved into position to enter me again. As he positioned himself against my opening I had to force myself to push back against him. He seemed to be waiting for that one to happen and slid his whole length inside me, not going to wait and go any faster, just starting a hard rhythmic stroke. I looked down at my own cock and it wasn't even fully hard yet and the expression on it was almost comical. "This isn't for me!" he exclaimed. I couldn't even help myself so I let him guide me as he moved me around.</p> <p>As soon as I started to move with him again, he grabbed my ass hard and lifted me up as he pounded me, making me yell out as he started to hit my g-spot, sending me over the edge into an orgasm that just got better and better. I came so hard that he had to hold me down so I couldn't move. I felt like he was just pulling all out, and then slamming in for all I was worth.</p> <p>I guess the orgasm he gave me was enough to send me along again because he groaned and held me down as he fired his load inside me, holding his cock deep inside until he finished again. He sat back down next me as he caught his breath, taking his cock out and letting it rest with his softening cock against mine. He pulled me in my arms and we shared a kiss, then said good bye and headed off out to my next class.</p> <p>As he left I couldn't believe that one little bit of him was still inside me, even though I had actually managed to put my arms around it. What I had been fantasizing about. I could actually feel it in me againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
