She said and he nodded his approval. He stood and she was beside him for the next 30 minutes until he was finally able to speak again. "I'm ready to leave now," she said, her hand reaching down and squeezing his hard cock through his pants. He leaned towards her. He could feel her breath on his face and in his ear. She whispered, "I want to make love tonight, and you are not the only one to feel the desire. I'll be here waiting for you, when you are ready I'll be waiting a lot for you to take me in your arms." She led him up the steps and he stopped for a short moment as he heard the faint sound of the door opening. She held his gaze. His eyes darted around the small room, and finally they had her.</p> <p>It was clear where they were going, and he thought he could get her to stop if this was something she didn't want to do. They walked side by side over an ornate stair case, and when they arrived at the top she stopped. She looked down at him, and was stunned as his eyes swept her naked body. "Wow," she managed to say once her breath returned. Once back where she stood he took her hand in his and they slowly strolled down the path, not in a hurry, but still holding the gaze she had set on his. Eventually they reached the bottom, and it was dark outside, the streetlights coming in off the main street.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Gina was amazed at how slowly they had come, the only indication was the way they swayed so gracefully back and forth. Her arms dropped below, but she was not about to let him go. He was only half an inch taller than her and it was more than ten inches across, a fact she noticed when he came up on her. He put his hands on her shoulders and kissed her neck slowly. He gently moved from her to her ear, where he would gently bite on her earlobe. He did this several times before whispering, "I want to kiss you now."</p> <p>It was only as she felt his hands moving over her neck, kneading her skin with his palms that she could speak. "Wait," Gina whispered, "I've got to go. I have to get going. Will you be okay with kissing me after dinner?" He nodded and she leaned forward and kissed him passionately on the lips.</p> <p>As she was taking her breath away she leaned in and kissed him harder. She felt his tongue slide past her lips, and into her mouth, exploring her mouth. She felt the excitement as his hand moved down her cheek and back to her neck and he sucked on her lip. "Oh my," she gasped and her eyes closed momentarily before opening.</p> <p>His hand moved to her nipple and started to knead it through her clothes. She felt him moving towards her ear and his hot breath on her exposed neck as his fingers slid down her dress, moving underneath it, searching for her panties. His hand found her bare pussy, and felt her heat and wetness. Her eyes opened and she looked into his eyes as their eyes moved together in the darkness; his fingers moved down over her pussy lips which were already moist. He leaned closer to her, their lips separated and they shared a knowing look. Gina's hands came up to his face, and she smiled as her fingers explored his ears while hers moved down his spine to the small of his back.</p> <p>Gina had never been with another woman before, she thought as she took a step back and stared into his brown eyes. Although she had been with men before, it had never really satisfied her sexually. It was always a bit frightening and frightening, yet incredibly sexually fulfilling. She thought she knew what to do and leaned to kiss him hard on the lips. He responded in kind, kissing her and returning her kiss with as much passion as she felt for him. She stepped back a bit, turning away from him and reaching her hands around front him to undo his button, pushing his pants and underwear to the ground. She pulled her dress down and saw that his eyes had returned to the road.</p> <p>Gina slid her underwear down over her heels, and stepped out of them. She had never been with any woman, not like this, not like the fantasy she read in her fantasies. She felt he had not taken his eyes off her as she lay across the truck, legs spread, inviting him to touch her. She watched as she felt his eyes on her body, his lips moving over her stomach and thighs. She felt a tingle as his body shifted and sat down next to her. The smell of his cologne was intoxicating. She opened her eyes and looked into his. His eyes locked onto hers. She smiled softly at him as she stepped across his lap, her back facing him. She straddled his crotch, and felt hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
