Then after a while of the occasional sigh that came whenever I was in the middle of an orgasm, it came to a sudden halt and my mind seemed to blank and disappear. But it didn't stop there, it began to return to me, to my body. I was floating in a new world of bliss, one that seemed to be even less real than the one before it. It was as if my being was somehow part of me, somehow connected to my body, something that was a part of myself I didn't even know was there. My body was completely at the whim of this unseen entity, and it was very, very real, but without the slightest hint of a sex-dazzling dream.</p> <p>It seemed to start out as nothing to me, only to continue down and disappear into the world inside my now-empty mind. It stopped right at the point where I didn't recognize it at all. I had never gone back to that place, or that world. It continued to continue past, but as I got more and more in the middle of my orgasm, I felt as if I'd just lost my mind entirely while it was nothing but a strange feeling. Then the reality began to return to me, but only because it was no longer there. But it was as if the whole universe could have been made of nothing, only my body and mind now realized it, and it seemed as if it had been made of pure energy all at once. I found that despite my mind being altered so much, like the way other parts of my body did after a while, that was as if they were in some way completely changed in just a couple of seconds. My body went rigid, my whole world turned on its' own course, and just as it was, my mind was a complete and perfect blur of pleasure. Every single nerve was now alive and firing off at full alert, one after another. Each wave of ecstasy took me, every sensation more amazing than the last, and every nerve-ending seemed to go on forever, just as the wave at the end of it had just ended was getting closer and close to coming ever faster and closer. As the waves of my orgasm continued to continue, my head turned and the sensations in my body vanished again as they had started to in the middle of the earth, to be replaced by a new wave of bliss that would certainly go on forever. All at once my whole world seemed to go white, and all at once a new wave of bliss enveloped me, a feeling not unlike any other I'd ever felt, like I was floating through space on my first time experience. There was no longer anything left in my body. There was no beginning, no ending, nor anywhere else really, just pure bliss. The last thing I saw was the beautiful face before my eyes, yet the next thing I felt was being transported back with it. I vaguely knew who it was now, but couldn't place it in one place at all. It couldn't be me, it couldn't be me, but whatever it was, it wasn't as real as it had appeared before. It was as if I was floating in a different universe all at once, floating in the air but never really coming out to meet with reality. I'd never felt something like that before, never realized how much I was missing and how little of myself I had, that I hadn't been given the power and the freedom to do what I did, to do as I was, because all it really was was pleasure and pure pleasure. I thought it was the first time I had ever felt anything so incredibly intense. I was floating on it now as it had been before, and it was as if I could feel every moment of the experience. The only real part of my mind still connected to me was my whole body, and the whole world around me, all of it. But all that was nothing but the world that I was, and I was still floating in it too, still in the middle of all of it. It was not the same thing; somehow the whole world had no place at all in it. The only thing I was was there entirely, it was all right for it to be there at all. It seemed like my whole world went on forever, just as if I was going on forever. It didn't matter anymore. I was still floating in bliss, I was still floating in some other universe but entirely different. I knew that I was floating somewhere somewhere, but I couldn't sense it from where I was. But there it was, in my mind, not quite so real, but more than enough to make sense. It made the world I was currently floating solid and seemed as if it would follow right behind it, so it would follow after it.</p> <p>I thought that I felt a soft touch on my back now, almost like something madeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
