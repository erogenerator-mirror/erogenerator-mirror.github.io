She asked, suddenly aware of the pain of this, and of how weak she'd felt when her father had called her a "faggot" before her, and of how she'd let herself make a mistake like this, and then let a stranger's hand stroke her inner thighs.</p> <p>"I'm sick of your mother's ass. You know how we used to be so close," Michaela snapped, her eyes going to the clock on the wall for the time being.</p> <p>"Why, you never gave her a chance to thank you for calling me," Michaela said angrily.</p> <p>"And I'd like nothing better than to see you cry," Michaela snapped. "I'd like nothing better than to see you make your mother cry like a little girl. What do you think I would be? I don't think I'd give a fuck for a minute I don't have a dick."</p> <p>Michaela was on her feet again, shaking. She turned and walked unsteadily toward the bed.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Michaela sat on her bed, the only thing keeping her standing. Her legs were shaking as she looked down at her hand in despair. She wasn't sure what was going to happen next, and she didn't have long to worry.</p> <p>"Andrea, what are you going to do?" Michaela cried. "Tell me what the hell is going on."</p> <p>"What is it?" Andrea looked up. "The fucking fuck that?"</p> <p>"The shit," Michaela screamed as she burst into tears and held herself in front of Andrea. "Go lie down on the fucking sofa."</p> <p>"No!" Andrea cried in response.</p> <p>"Why? You're just going to sit there and cry all night?" Michaela asked, her eyes turning towards Michaela.</p> <p>"What, Andrea?"</p> <p>"I don't understand." Andrea sobbed. The sobbing started to wilt her voice, and before she could say her piece it began to break against her flesh.</p> <p>"I have been married for twenty-seven years-- never! I can't imagine a time where I don't have a right to cry. And I had just moved back home to New York-- have we all moved to the same old neighborhood? And I've had three sons in this house and another in the other one's. And if I couldn't do it with my brother, I'd go and have a nice little home. But I can't, because of you."</p> <p>"And now?" Andrea stared at her. "You're just going to lay there and cry and let the bitch know that your mother doesn't love you as much as she wants to believe that she loves you. Do you really think that much of me? Or you? Who is your man?"</p> <p>"A man," Michaela replied as if that mattered. "A man. A man that I would rather take than any man I know."</p> <p>Michaela wasn't sure whether it mattered to her if she didn't even find out who she might have in her father's arms. But then, she was just going to sit here and cry, and if Michaela didn't care, how could she tell Andrea that? It would just be so bad to make her son hurt someone so badly that she'd even consider having a little fun with her.</p> <p>Michaela turned herself around so that the tears were only going to come out. "I'm too embarrassed," she said. "I'm not so good with men. I haven't even had a boyfriend. My boys have been such wimps over the past ten years."</p> <p>"Well, you can't expect that you're going to just settle down because of your family," Andrea snapped. "And you're not even going to go out with me until I say you can, either."</p> <p>"And that would be right."</p> <p>"It would be wrong of you to say that you're not interested in me," Andrea pointed out. "And you're not even going to go out with your brother."</p> <p>"I was never even going to date anyway," Michaela told Andrea, her arms crossed over her chest on the sofa. "And that whole thing with your brother was just too much. I didn't want to date a big, black man."</p> <p>"So what, you'll just be waiting to meet a white mother and go and let some rich old white man beat the shit out of you?" Andrea snorted.</p> <p>"No! You're never going to find a white man," Michaela said, her voice low. "Besides, you're not going to go there, are you? Or even let your parents go at it when they want to?"</p> <p>"There's nothing wrong with letting your father beatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
