She asked. "I'm telling you that I'm not going to let you do anything. It's not a good idea."</p> <p>"No," he said. "It's just that, well... I, I, ah, we've, we've been trying to talk it out. I mean it's only been a couple of hours but it's been really, really fucking amazing and, well, I just can't take it anymore and I guess I'm being... um, unreasonable?"</p> <p>Sara was looking at him, and he could feel her hands caressing his shoulders.</p> <p>"I just wanna be like you, Ryan. I wanna be the good guy. I'm not asking you to get me to do anything. Is that it?"</p> <p>"No, no." He said defensively. "I don't know what I'm asking you to do, that's it."</p> <p>"So what if she tells me to take my own clothes off? It's not just a one-time deal huh?"</p> <p>"No," Ryan said. "This is the last resort. There is no point in you being afraid to trust me."</p> <p>Sara took a breath. "Well you're not the only one who thinks so."</p> <p>"Yeah, I don't blame you. I was thinking," Ryan paused and said, "That you could always... you know, just take my clothes off and do it the old fashioned way."</p> <p>"I... yes. How, you uh, you know? Is that it?" Sara could feel her heart beating in her chest and she swallowed hard, her mouth suddenly dry.</p> <p>"I dunno."</p> <p>"What are you talking about?"</p> <p>"You know what I'm talking about here," he started to point out. "You're the one that started this whole thing because I thought about the first time we were going out. Yeah, I'm getting ahead of myself. What if I was wrong and it wasn't just the two of us? What if I really wanted to? What if... what if... I want to do something that I didn't want ever to do but that I've never done before."</p> <p>"Don't be such a wimp, Ryan," Sara said and she reached back to unzip his shorts.</p> <p>When they pulled away from each other and Ryan slid down his pants, Sara leaned forward and took his cock into her mouth.</p> <p>She'd done it.</p> <p>Ryan gasped.</p> <p>It had been the most exciting, most amazing thing of his life.</p> <p>Sara was sucking him off as she stared at him and then up at him. She looked so sexy. She knew he wanted to do more than just watch her blow him but this whole experience just seemed so intense to be able to just... take off her clothes for him. It kind of felt like a second time on a date. But he found that he was too overwhelmed with desire to just just have her now.</p> <p>Sara was the first to break off. She gave Ryan a lascivious grin and went back to work on his shaft. She leaned up, took his cock in one hand and gave it a lick.</p> <p>"Mmmmm," she moaned. "I'm not that bad, are you?"</p> <p>"No," he admitted. "I've never had anything so good."</p> <p>She grinned again. "You better hope."</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yes! No man has ever been so sure that he had a chance at doing better than you. Come on, let me show you what I can do."</p> <p>She took his cock in her hand again and went back to work. She licked and bobbled it. She cupped his balls and gently rolled them around.</p> <p>"Are you sure you wanna do this?"</p> <p>"I think I do," he said.</p> <p>"Don't be like that big dick," she told him. "Let's just get it over with."</p> <p>"I thought you said you're not going to do anything else?" he asked.</p> <p>"I don't. I just wanna show you how good I can suck a cock."</p> <p>"Well you can suck me. It's my birthday."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>Ryan nodded. He pulled her up slightly and kissed her. Sara took her hand and pulled him down to the couch. She knelt down in front of him and opened his shorts. He was now naked, except for his boxers and she reached in, grabbing his cock with her other hand. She pulled him toward her and she felt him move against her lips.</p> <p>"This..." she said.
