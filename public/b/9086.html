I did this slowly, allowing her some sort of time with her mind and body before going deeper. It would have been a strange and frightening experience on my part, but she didn't seem to mind.</p> <p>"Are you ready?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes, please fuck me."</p> <p>I started fucking her from behind, my hips slapping against her soft ass. I was not as gentle as I would have been yesterday. The pain of the tightness was overwhelming as my cock reached deepest inside her ass. This time I did not give her time to enjoy it. I slammed my cock into her again and again and again, pounding it into her. When she started to respond, I grabbed her hips and pounded her ass with as much force as I could. Just as I was about to pull away again, I drove my cock deep inside her and fucked her until she was cumming in an amazing orgasm. My cum came in waves in her pussy and ass. It took her a moment to recover then she looked over her shoulder at me and said, "You fucking bastard!"</p> <p>In that matter, my cock softened and left her ass, and she turned away from me. She did not look guilty or ashamed in the least at her violation by me. She smiled at me and said, "You are a wonderful lover."</p> <p>I leaned over her and kissed her forehead and then started up the stairs. This was the best sex we had had the past year of that, and we were both exhausted.</p> <p>We did not tell a soul. It was just not the same once we moved into another roomâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
