He was a new addition to my life. He was now a junior partner, just out of law school in New Jersey. He worked for me for many years, and although working on the docks on a weekly basis had been a challenge, we had found a way to get around each other. We had become fast friends and enjoyed each other's company.</p> <p>I had worked my way through law school to a second in command, and had finally become well respected by everyone and everything around, even my own firm. I had never worked a day over thirty, with my average of six years in teaching. As I grew older my skills with the navy were growing faster than mine. I was now a senior partner in a multi finance firm of major brokerage firms in New Jersey. I spent most of my time attending the corporate Christmas party annually, and had not been home ever since.</p> <p>It was after a dinner party where the partners and I were to attend. The formal affair included entertainment, and I was to take on the role as a "party man." I was dressed in shorts and a polo shirt. As I got up I recognized my role from a few stories I had read on the web.</p> <p>I took a seat at the table. The women sat next to each of my partners. I was in the middle of a long, slow conversation with one of the few ones in the group. My partner was talking about a local bank, and had no idea of my real purpose. He was so far along it didn't take long to overhear and know that I was the man and the company. My partner had been telling me all the jokes and my partner on the other hand was in much more of a hurry to share his tales with everyone around him.</p> <p>When I finished with dinner the three of us went back to the family room, lit only by candle light from the flickering candles in our dining room.</p> <p>We sat in silence for a long time, only breaking after a sip of wine. The rest of the evening was a blur to everyone. They all knew all the names of their wives and each of their significant others and some of the men were my buddies but there was nothing I could do. After awhile I broke the ice by asking the men whether they were still interested in me. I could feel the heat rising in the room as I looked at each one of them.</p> <p>My partner broke the silence first by asking them "Have you ever been with a woman?"</p> <p>The man closest to me said "Well, at least in bed, and I haven't."</p> <p>There was a long pause. After a moment the man who I had first kissed earlier said "No one has."</p> <p>Another pause, and my partner said "I'm serious." He smiled and added "Yes, I've had a lot of experience."</p> <p>There was another pause, and my partner asked "It's been a while."</p> <p>My partner responded "I'm sure, but I know a few things that some of you don't know." He looked me in the eye, and said "You're right, there are a few things that you need to know."</p> <p>The man next to him said "So, let's get you into the bedroom, that we have never done before."</p> <p>At this point my partner said "Okay, but first let's get you up on the bed and show you how a real woman feels."</p> <p>By this point my partner had stripped off his t-shirt and pants and was sliding off his underwear and shoes. The other men stood around looking at my partner.</p> <p>Finally my partner pulled back his boxer shorts, showing the biggest rock-hard penis I had ever seen before. He looked at me for a moment, and then motioned for me to give him something to drink. He took a long drink, and said it was about time we got started. They all got up and walked over to us. I sat on the floor, and he was on top of me in a minute. He pushed his penis deep inside of me, and began pumping into me. I could feel his body against mine as he continued fucking me slowly and sensually.</p> <p>He was now going over a threshold. I could feel him going as deep inside me as he could get, and could feel my body tightening up and my pussy tightening up around his member.</p> <p>After several minutes of this sexual contact, he was about to cum as he came inside of me. I could feel his juices searing my insides as he shot his load. At the same time his penis started shooting his semen in my body. It was the last thing I heard as I lay there in a pile of body heat. After many minutes of the man fucking me, the couple left the table, got up to leave but another manâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
