I see them." I looked out the window as they came back in. They didn't look anything like what I expected. They were pretty athletic looking, but really built like wrestlers. They had on the tshirt that I liked, and they could have had really hot bodies.</p> <p>"They just did. We can't believe it. We are being robbed." I said in disbelief.</p> <p>"Well, we're going to stop and pay them. We have to go along with them." They replied.</p> <p>I watched them walk out of the window, and out of the building towards home. "So, you guys don't mind hanging out with us after all?" I asked.</p> <p>"Not at all." Said Amy. "We're gonna hang out and have some fun. We have money to get us along, and I want to try out the swing and the dander thing. We thought that's why you guys were taking us out to the boat."</p> <p>"Yeah. Yeah, we all thought that too, but you know what? We're not going to do anything that's against the law." Said Joe.</p> <p>"Well, we'll see, I guess." I said.</p> <p>"It's just not fair, you'll always be with our families." Said Amy.</p> <p>"Yeah, we'll get caught, so don't worry." Said Pete.</p> <p>"No, it's not that." Said Joe. "Our parents are so happy they made us all feel at peace."</p> <p>"Yeah, so is mine, but she doesn't even know he's got it!"</p> <p>"Well, I'd bet it's the first time, or if not the last, he'll have us in one hell of a predicament here." I said.</p> <p>"Well, I don't want to go, I hope you still want to hang around a little though." Said Amy.</p> <p>"Yeah, it's cool, anyway, this is a fun thing. No one has to know about us being here, we just show up and hang out there, and we can be ourselves." Said Joe.</p> <p>"Yeah, we're in no hurry. Come on." I said. I grabbed Amy's hand, and we walked towards my truck. "You should take this with you." I said.</p> <p>"Thanks. You need some place to stay after college huh?" She smiled.</p> <p>"Yeah, we're in no hurry, and we can take care of ourselves."</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess it shouldn't be a problem. My parents will be there with us, they live a half-hour up the road, but they won't see us, let alone anything else. They were just as good as they look."</p> <p>"What about the boat?" Amy asked.</p> <p>"Nothing much, just one long day of freedom." I said.</p> <p>"Yeah, we should have one or two days off from school before we graduate." Said Joe.</p> <p>"Yeah, you guys want to watch a movie?" I asked.</p> <p>"Sure." Said Joe. We watched some cheesy action flick. I had my arm around Amy's waist, and she snuggled in against me. I could feel her breasts pressing against my arm and I could smell her perfume. I wanted to kiss her, and she didn't seem to care at all. "Well, I guess that's no problem." We finished the movie, and I told her so.</p> <p>When we got to Amy's place, she didn't even bother to get the DVD out. She threw down the DVD, and went to turn the TV on. She looked at me and asked "What were we doing?"</p> <p>"What do you think?" I grinned as I grabbed her. Our kissing grew passionate, and I dropped my hands from fondling her breasts to caressing her. I had a hand underneath her tee-shirt, rubbing her nipples as I kissed her. I felt her arms come around my back and she pressed her upper body against me as I sucked her tongue into my mouth. "Take of your shirt too!" I asked her.</p> <p>"Not yet. We need to get undressed and get into bed." Said Amy. She undid the shirt, and threw it on the couch beside the TV and we got into the bed. I pulled her head down so that we were lying on pillows, and kissed her neck. I ran my tongue down to her right breast, causing her to moan. I then kissed down her body, stopping to do so again. I kissed her on the stomach, and her stomach, which made her sigh out. As I kissed down her, I slid my finger down her side, tickling her soft skin as I kissed her. I slid down to her feet, which made her sigh louder. I could tell that she was enjoying this. As I kissed upâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
