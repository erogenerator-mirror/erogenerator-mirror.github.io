She wanted to give her best friend everything tonight so if she didn't show by the end of the evening she'd just end up making it a night of her life, and her best friends were going to be there.</p> <p>Before she left the house the door to her bedroom closed behind her. At least it was done for her.</p> <p>She stood outside her parent's house for a couple of minutes, waiting. When she finally heard the door go in she couldn't help but burst into tears and ran upstairs and closed and locked the door.</p> <p>And there was no telling what she might find on her weekend or the next day if she didn't get her wish. She ran into her room and quickly threw on her robe before wrapping it around herself and locking herself in her room again.</p> <p>As soon as she was done with her bath Jenny took off her robe and walked naked upstairs.</p> <p>When she looked at herself in the mirror she looked...</p> <p>HOLY SH! WHAT WASSSSSSSSSS!!! Did her best friend just TELL her that she's going to be there to watch her boyfriend fuck his new girlfriend?</p> <p>She quickly grabbed the robe and pulled it on and hurried out the door.</p> <p>When Jenny got home her parents greeted her downstairs in the garden as soon as she came through the door.</p> <p>Jenny was shocked to see that both her parents were wearing only a robe. They looked so happy.</p> <p>"Hello Jenny, good to see you home," Mom said, greeting the happy couple.</p> <p>Jenny and Dad greeted Jenny as well, hugging and hugging all the way, even kissing her on the cheek. Jenny felt a little better.</p> <p>"Good to see you," she said politely to Jenny.</p> <p>"Hey, Mom," Dad said, "come on inside with me, I'm sure you have more questions." Dad gave his wife a quick kiss on her cheek before he turned his attention to Jenny and the three of them sat down on their lounges.</p> <p>"I'll have to run, Jenny," Jenny said, "I'm sure we can take care of all your questions and I'm sure you can use me for a little extra...for tonight. Oh, and by the way, I called Mom and she answered that I was going to be having dinner at your house tonight after I got off work and that she wanted to pick my girlfriend up and take their overnight bag."</p> <p>"Uh...excuse me, I'll see you at home," Dad said, "I'll let you know all the way up."</p> <p>Jenny's mother got up and walked back over to Jenny, wrapping her arms around her, kissing her on the top of her head and whispering into her ear. Jenny just about stuttered out a response to this, even though she knew that her mother's voice was still husky in her ear. But she was still speechless.</p> <p>Jenny's mother finally released Jenny and went back to picking up the rest of her stuff, giving the kids a kiss on Jenny's cheek, then left the garden.</p> <p>Jenny's father stood up and went into the house.</p> <p>After Mom had gone she went into the bathroom and got the shower going, and then had nothing else to do but clean up.</p> <p>After drying off she went back and had a little more thoughtfulness in her mind that she had a few years earlier that she couldn't seem to figure out yet of what she wanted to do with her life. After a lot of thought time was just being done her thoughts and her thoughts became a blur.</p> <p>It was a great time to have some alone time.</p> <p>Jenny had a wonderful time, and she knew that her father had some good time at home, and Jenny knew that she and her best friend had a good time together.</p> <p>Jenny made love at the house every night, as often as she could, and every day too...even though her most of her activities were still with her parents. One night Jenny left her father for the night and took her father down one of the stairs, and took him back upstairs. She didn't think about anything else for too long, until her mother took the kids to her room.</p> <p>Jenny was shocked when her mother took her in her bedroom.</p> <p>She had heard her mother, though only half way through it, talk to her mother that night.
