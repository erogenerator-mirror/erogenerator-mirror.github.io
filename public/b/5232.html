Now, I'd love to help you out, but I just don't know any better to say when it's not to get any help from anyone else. So...I suppose you're gonna have to leave then, aren't you? That's all?"</p> <p>"Yep. It's been a good day so far. I guess I should probably get started, too," he said with a smile. "Besides, he's all by himself and it's a shame he couldn't have your breakfast."</p> <p>"I think I might like you to bring yourself through at some point," Sarah joked as she leaned forward and kissed him. "I could do with some more exercise too."</p> <p>"That'd be great. I think I'm ready for a shower though, don't you?"</p> <p>"Of course," she said as she stepped down off the bed. "I can't wait to get a good massage. I'm thinking about some kinky stuff after dinner after I'm done. I don't see how it's going to help me, though...do you have a few minutes?" She asked with an inviting smile.</p> <p>"Not really, I'll be right back."</p> <p>They stood up and Sarah slid her arms around his neck. He held her, pressing close to her so his hard, naked body pressed firmly into hers. Their hands went straight to each other's breasts as Sarah began to run her hands over his muscular back. He let his hands slid slowly down her back as she let her hands slide up more. He squeezed her ass as she pressed her body back harder against his own. He lifted Sarah's chin, bringing her mouth so they could kiss. His lips were soft, inviting and wet as they slid around hers, drawing it across until it finally had to be kissed. Sarah broke her kiss for a moment to breath as she stood there feeling his hard body against her back. When his lips finally left hers, she felt the tingle of excitement wash over her, a feeling that was both new and exciting for her as it took her mind off how she was feeling with him.</p> <p>"Ready to finish what you started?" she asked, hoping he was.</p> <p>"No, I'm all dirty inside from all this food and work."</p> <p>"Are you OK with that?"</p> <p>"More than OK," he said as he stood up and put her into the doggie position on the bed. He was still shirtless and had no underwear on. He spread her knees apart and leaned in, running his tongue over her wet crotch. He quickly found her clitoris and sucked it into his mouth, feeling her body twitch as he did so. His hands slipped from her ass and down her legs, running down her smooth, tanned flesh as he explored her soft skin. He let his tongue probe her, his hands sliding under the bottom edge of her panties to find her pussy again. He pulled them right off, making sure they were well-placed between her thighs before sliding his face down between her legs. His tongue went straight into her as her head leaned back against the pillows. He slid his lips and tongue all around, paying careful attention to her clit to make sure it wasn't damaged. He let his tongue glide up and down her damp lips, finding her swollen clit as he went up. He sucked on it as she arched her back. Sarah began to push back against his face as she began to shake. "Yes! Just like that! Oh. Oh. Oh! Oh! OH! YES! YES! YES! YES!" she shouted, her body thrashing and rocking against his hands as she came.</p> <p>With that all done, Sarah stood up again and looked down to see that her mouth was a little watery. The smell of her excited sex was heavy in the room. She quickly wiped her mouth and face off with the back of her hand and returned to the bed, still breathing heavily from her orgasm. She climbed on to the bed, climbing on top of him. Sarah ran her hands down his stomach and to his cock where it throbbed against her hip. She kissed and sucked his nipples, and he cupped her face, pulling her face back up to kiss her.</p> <p>Sarah broke the kiss long enough to gasp for breath as she grabbed his cock and rubbed it against her wet pussy lips. She gasped as she felt him slide into her, letting her body adjust to his size. After a few seconds, Sarah began to move in a steady rhythm as she moved her body up and back, grinding her pussy on his hard cock. She lifted her leg up over his pelvis and reached between them to grab his balls as her hips pushed down against him.</p> <p>They continued to kiss and stroke each other. Their hands went everywhere.
