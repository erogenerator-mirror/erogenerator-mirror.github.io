She could drive herself back home. I walked her home, walked her to her door, kissed her goodnight and went to bed.</p> <p>When I saw her car in the driveway I went over to the pool. I swam to the edge. I swam to the steps of the pool steps, I went to the steps. I went back to the steps.</p> <p>I swam to the pool. I swam over to her home. I swam up to the deck and then I went back to the steps. I swam into the pool. I swam to the edge, I swam to my side, I swam to the edge. It was time to call it a day. I took one more swim.</p> <p>I went back to the house. My house was so empty without her. I went into the bedroom. I lay on the bed. I was so tired I went to sleep, but not before.</p> <p>When I woke it was almost noon. I could smell lunch cooking. I got up from the bed and went over to the dining room table. I picked up a spoon so they were the only things in the room.</p> <p>Sometime during lunch I heard someone talking. I could not make out anything. I heard water running. I could not make out who it was from the sound of it. The sound of people talking didn't bother me. I was hungry, I went upstairs. I put on a robe that I had brought up when I went shopping, got her some water. I sat down and ate. When I finished she came out of the shower. She was wearing her robe. I could see the dried tears on her cheeks.</p> <p>She looked sad. With her hand she gently wiped her tears away. She turned and looked at me. I held up my hand to stop her. I said, "I've been thinking about you."</p> <p>She looked at me. "I know."</p> <p>"I just, ummm, I'm so tired. I just want...well I just want to tell you."</p> <p>"Tell me what?"</p> <p>I took her hand in mine and turned to her, "I just wanted a chance to meet you."</p> <p>For the first time in a long time she looked at me. At first she just said, "I thought I was never going to meet you."</p> <p>I took her face between my hands and looked into her eyes. "I thought you were never going to come back."</p> <p>"Well, no I'm not."</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>I took her in my arms.</p> <p>"Because you came back to me wanting my mother."</p> <p>"I'm not your daughter."</p> <p>"Then why would you want me like that?"</p> <p>"Because I didn't want to hurt you."</p> <p>I took her chin in my hand and started to turn her face up towards me. "I know. I don't think I'm that old." Looking into her eyes I said, "You are beautiful. You'll never forget me."</p> <p>With her face all wet, her tears wet her cheeks, she smiled and said, "Really?"</p> <p>"Yes. Really."</p> <p>She held her arms up towards me and I put my arms around her. "Tell me where you see me."</p> <p>She smiled nervously. "Nowhere in the back yard."</p> <p>I kissed her cheek. "It's not far."</p> <p>"Where?"</p> <p>"To the house."</p> <p>"But I don't have a car."</p> <p>"It's ok, just take me."</p> <p>"I don't. I'm afraid of taking you away from me."</p> <p>She shook her head. "I don't want that. I want you back."</p> <p>I kissed her chin. "I don't want you to worry."</p> <p>"No. I want this. Just us."</p> <p>I held her face in my hand. "That what I want." Taking her hands in mine I turned her towards the bed, sat her down and said, "You're beautiful."</p> <p>"Thank you."</p> <p>She climbed on the bed and crawled over. She looked at me. There was a sadness in her eyes. I looked at her, looked deep into her eyes. I kissed her softly, put my mouth to her ear and whisper to her, "I love you." I kissed the inside of her cheeks. Kissed her nose.</p> <p>"I love you."
