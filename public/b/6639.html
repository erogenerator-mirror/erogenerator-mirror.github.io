Her moan of pleasure was clear; he wanted to please her. He could feel her nipple, as it became hard against his palm and he quickly moved his attention to it, with his tongue circling it. Her eyes widened and she sucked in a bit of air and her head fell back. She moaned again, her knees weakening slightly. He moved his hand from her breast and trailed its fingers over the smoothness of her leg; her hips moved slightly as he did, so he moved around in front of her towards her hips.</p> <p>"You're doing it again...just for me..." he whispered against her stomach as he slid her skirt along her hips. He wanted to take her. He wanted her to feel as he wanted to feel her. As he slipped his fingers below her panties, he found only the wetness he needed for him as he pressed his index finger against her. She was trembling beneath him; he could feel her heart rate as it raced through her entire body. He was intoxicated by her.</p> <p>"Just think of this as 'just for you'..." he whispered again against her stomach before leaving a trail of wet kisses down to the line of her navel. He could feel her breathing increase as his mouth finally met her, his hands holding her firmly to him. His lips pressed against hers, she responded with a small gasp, their tongues exploring each others mouths. Her hands grabbed his shoulders as they broke contact and she moaned as she brought her hands to rest on the top of his shoulder blades, which she had pushed up into a sexy bend. She could feel him tremble under her hands, his eyes following her. The kiss was hard and powerful as she felt his hands leave her. They were both breathing heavily.</p> <p>"How does that feel?" she whispered to him. He smiled and she felt himself nod. She could tell by his hesitation that it was his turn to be nervous.</p> <p>"I'm not sure..." he began as he looked down at her. "It's not that."</p> <p>Her hand slid down his chest to his stomach. "Neither am I." she told him, feeling him shift nervously beneath her. "It's not because I thought it was weird..." she said to him, and gave him a small smile as she reached down the front of his t-shirt and felt his skin as she traced the soft skin of his torso down to his thighs.</p> <p>He moaned as her fingers brushed against his skin, her hand leaving him, feeling her presence as she did. They looked into each other's eyes, silently. It was a beautiful moment, filled with the heat and passion between them; their only connection to the world. The desire inside them was strong and evident in how he was feeling. He didn't want her to feel any less at that moment. He wanted her to feel at the same time.</p> <p>He broke the silence that had formed with a slight whisper. He spoke as he turned towards her and laid the softest kiss on her lips. She responded with another soft moan of desire. His lips caressed her lips, feeling the softness of her lips, not wanting to hurt her. They were both so much taller than she was, and his hands were holding her, guiding her. He moved one hand down to her waist, over the top of the lacy black thong that matched the top of her suit. Her eyes were closed as he reached up slowly, and his hand went under the fabric to cup her breast through the thin fabric of her bikini. His thumb lightly grazed over her nipple, then he used his other hand to pull her onto him, so that they were fully pressed against each other.</p> <p>They moaned softly, lost in the moment. He could feel her hand on his stomach, and it felt so sensual, so perfect to make love to her. He needed this. He wanted to just feel her so close to him, not wanting to be anywhere else, but somehow in his desire, in this moment when they were the same person and not one he'd ever had.</p> <p>Hearing his own moans from around her lips, she felt him pull her, so she came to him as they made a circle of her body. He moved his hands down her back, his thumb tracing along her collarbone as he kissed her again. She reached behind her hand and took his cheek. She broke the kiss and pulled him towards her. He kissed her, his tongue tracing along her lips as his hands went down her back to her hips, moving to unhook her bikini. He pulled the bikini away from her skin, leaving her there to feel the cool of the water against her bare skin. He wanted to kiss her like he kissed her all over again.</p> <p>He stood up and slowly turned off the water, which caused her to almost jump outâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
