So, if you get the job, come here and do whatever it is you can to help me. Please?" she begged, tears forming in her eyes.</p> <p>"Sure, let me see your body," I said, holding her up against the wall of my office.</p> <p>Without being able to see far, I grabbed her around her waist and pulled her back to me.</p> <p>Her arms snaked around me under the bar counter. She leaned against me with her chin on my shoulder and her legs wrapped around me. Her breasts pressed against me, her ass rubbed against the bulge of my cock. She was already hot.</p> <p>"Thank you, sir. I am so nervous," she whispered.</p> <p>"No you are not, your job is to help me. That's all."</p> <p>"So I'll bet, sir," she said, pushing her body against mine.</p> <p>The kiss ended abruptly and when I pulled away she was crying like a little girl. Her eyes were wild, red and flushed. I leaned down to kiss her, and she kissed me back like a bitch in heat. We both went up on a high and didn't let go.</p> <p>I didn't care about the situation. I just wanted to fuck this girl in the worst way.</p> <p>The phone rang. It was Jim wanting to know when they had everything settled.</p> <p>"Yeah," Buck answered.</p> <p>"Buck, I'll be over in a minute. If you can do my part to help you, I have one favor first," Buck said. "I want him in to see you when he comes back to meet with us. Buck, can you come over with me?" Buck asked.</p> <p>"Sure, Buck. What is it?"</p> <p>"Buck, I can't trust your boss with anything. He has to know I'm around. He says he can come in when we're here."</p> <p>"Sure," Buck said, and hung up the phone. "I'll come right over."</p> <p>We walked over to Buck's office together and when we walked in Buck walked in and told me to come in, which I did. Buck said, "Buck wants you," before Buck shut the door behind him.</p> <p>"You're supposed to be over here, Buck, not out here fucking him. I know if Buck knew you were here, we would be in trouble."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Buck said he'll be seeing you and you can come get us. When he comes in, you can say something and I'll come get you."</p> <p>"Get me what?" Buck asked.</p> <p>"Come in on the other side," Buck said, taking his hand and leading us toward the door.</p> <p>"But...you're supposed to be alone," Buck said.</p> <p>"And here I thought you didn't like me," Buck said.</p> <p>"There is no way we can get us out here," Buck said. "Buck and I love this job and I know you're still pissed at me. My boss is a man. There is no way I let him touch you, or get you into bed. I just want to make sure your job is kept safe."</p> <p>Buck walked Buck from the room, locking the door behind them.</p> <p>Buck turned to Buck as Buck headed toward his office. Buck said, "Bucker, you can bring anything you like. Just come in and close the door and don't look in until we're done, okay?" Buck nodded his assent.</p> <p>Buck and I walked in the door as Buck pulled a package from one of the stacks and handed it to me. It had a pair of headphones and a small case. He put it on the small table in the middle of the room and turned off the light. Buck walked me back toward the chair Buck was sitting at and said, "Buckle, I didn't want our boss meeting you with such a short notice. I didn't want this to take advantage of him."</p> <p>"Buck, you don't have to keep him here. He's got a lot to do. We're both in a business relationship for God's sake."</p> <p>"It looks like it will," Buck said as he undid his button and opened his fly. He was fully hard. His cock bobbed in front of him as he removed his shorts. His cock flopped out at Buck, making a long thick strand of white cum hanging from it. Buck was looking at the head of Buck's cock when Buck said, "You can have me in here but you have to stay until Buck comes back." Buck gave Buck a wicked grin and said, "Come sit in the chair in front of me." Buck took a seat, and Buck put a cushion under his headâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
