I was feeling my cheeks red for some reason, and she kept giggling about it. "Would you like to join us?" She asked.</p> <p>"I... I mean... I'm not sure... I mean..." I stumbled over my words. "I mean I want to but I'm just nervous."</p> <p>"Its ok," she assured me. "Just come up. We have a room, right over there?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess," I thought I managed to keep my feelings under control from her. I walked up to the door and knocked.</p> <p>She opened it and a young pretty blond with huge tits stood there. Her hair hung down to the middle of her back, and looked awesome. She took a step forward to me and motioned for me to come in.</p> <p>"Welcome, I'm Sam," she said with a smile as she shook my hand. "Please have a seat," she added with a bow to the bartender.</p> <p>"Ah, I didn't know you had a room," I said to her. I tried to keep it as casual as I could, but we talked on this and that for a while before Sam brought over this one table.</p> <p>Sam came out with a tray of drinks for her and a tray of sandwiches and chips.</p> <p>"Hey Sam" I spoke up, my nerves were still high at being in this situation.</p> <p>"Good to see you, Jim," she smiled wide. "Do you come here often?"</p> <p>"I just work here now, at least a bit."</p> <p>"Good. I'm so glad your here. I'm here because we invited you over for a special occasion. It's so good to finally get away from all your stresses."</p> <p>"I'm here because I want to," I stammered a bit and said nothing. This was kind of strange to me, being all nervous around a girl, especially a girl a bit older than me. "I can see why you were nervous," I added, unsure of what to expect.</p> <p>"Yeah." She took a sip from her drink. "I don't really want to tell you this, but I just feel like I don't really have the right to be here."</p> <p>She took a sip again. "My dad owns this hotel, and I used to work there when we were young. I'm really sorry about my dad, I don't mean to be nosy. I didn't want to seem too desperate when we invited you over, but if you're not coming too we're sorry."</p> <p>Sam set down her drink and looked at me seriously.</p> <p>"Jim, I don't want to be here because you're not going to come over when that happens. It's ok. I had the chance to have a beer in the park a few times."</p> <p>"Yeah, I've been in a lot of these places."</p> <p>"I never liked how expensive it tasted. I think we'll probably have to get something for the next day or so." Sam said before she set her drink back down and grabbed my hand and led me to the small side room down the hall by the pool. "Come on into the bathroom."</p> <p>Sam closed the door and turned to look at me. "What?"</p> <p>"You heard me. I want you to try it out."</p> <p>Sam walked towards me and pulled me into her bedroom. I sat down in the side chair just as Sam's hands started to rub my shoulders.</p> <p>"Oh, Jim." Tears rolled silently down from my eyes, I was crying and she was rubbing away some of it. I was scared. I needed Sam, I needed to be with her. I looked up to Sam and whispered, "It's ok."</p> <p>Sam laughed to herself. "Relax and just feel."</p> <p>Sam's hands moved down my arms and rubbed against the material of my swimsuit bottoms. Her fingers grazed over my upper thighs and she felt my penis.</p> <p>"I just thought maybe we had a little something here," Sam explained. "I love your bikini, they're very nice."</p> <p>"You think so?" I asked, the thought of my body in her hands was so weird.</p> <p>"I think so. They're very flattering," Sam giggled. "What are you doing?" she asked, rubbing her hands over my stomach. "Let's get ready. It's going so well so far."</p> <p>With that she pulled off my suit and I stood there shivering with embarrassment. Sam pulled me down on the bed and lay on top of me, and kissed me passionately. She pushed her tongue slowly into my mouth and explored my mouth with herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
