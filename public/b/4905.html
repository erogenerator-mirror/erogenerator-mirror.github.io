They were a big turn on for her and she could feel an ache between her thighs. She started stroking her finger in and out of her hot sex but before she could do anything about it, he suddenly pulled back, saying, "I don't want you sucking the load off my cock while I am here. You know the rules. Do what you can. Get the fuck off him and get ready for the fun to begin if he is good with that. And leave that asshole alone."</p> <p>His words seemed to spur her on but she didn't object. As she walked towards him to suck him she could feel him getting impatient again. "Suck his cock like you did the first time and I'll let you suck my dick. Then after you do that it's up to you what you do with my balls."</p> <p>Now on her knees she went to him, bent over and started sucking him off. His cock felt good and she couldn't wait to get it hard again. There was just enough time for him to enter her again and then they kissed passionately. He was definitely not going to be a stranger to her, much to her pleasure.</p> <p>It was time to go to the other room. She was more than ready and she was so horny. She was also incredibly eager and she wasn't going to last long. If they kept this up, she was going to have another orgasm by the end of the night. She started moving her body up and down like she wanted to fuck him again, making her sex wetter with every stroke. "This is great," she thought. She didn't need him to watch to know that it would be great.</p> <p>While he was at work, she kept in touch with her roommate, Amanda. Their friendship had blossomed quickly and now they had shared all their experiences like they were the best friends. She had started to get into it when she was just a little excited. She had no worries about what others would think or do if they knew. She was hooked. She really did like the attention of the other guy. And when he walked by in her hallway and saw her there in nothing but a towel, it would be like nothing that she had all day or any day at all. And she loved it. She didn't know what she wanted to do, but she did. He would get excited too. He really liked it that she liked him. They had discussed it once and she had wanted him to see her naked. She knew that he just wanted to be with her again. But to do so would be to do everything else except her sex.</p> <p>She spent most of the day talking to her roommate and she could tell that she was still in the spirit of things. She wanted to tell her roommate what she really wanted but was afraid to speak and she knew that it might change anything between them but it seemed to happen the morning after they got together.</p> <p>"I'm so horny," she thought. "I've been thinking of you all day and it doesn't bother me anymore. It just makes me want you to be inside me."</p> <p>By the end of the second day, they had had sex more times then they could do it in over four days. She was dripping wet again. When he saw her naked in the hallway, he felt his dick hard once again. He knew he wasn't going to last long. She had taken him completely by surprise. She looked over as he exited his office.</p> <p>"Are you ever going to finish what you started?" she asked.</p> <p>"Maybe," he replied.</p> <p>Amanda was looking into his eyes, "You've been so good."</p> <p>"I know," He told her as they walked to the desk in his office that looked out of the back parking lot.</p> <p>They sat there talking for the first hour or so when the phone rang. Amanda was on the cell for only a minute and she was surprised to see that it was her father.</p> <p>"Hey, sweetheart," she told Brian.</p> <p>"You should have brought your phone," he said.</p> <p>"I did," Amanda said. She had a feeling he would be pissed if she ever brought up it again.</p> <p>"Let's go to my office," he said.</p> <p>Amanda got up and got her car and headed for the car park. It was still light out and she didn't want to risk getting lost. "You should talk to your father when you get back," she thought.</p> <p>She spent the next hour going through a few options. She knew that she was going to have to talk to Brianâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
