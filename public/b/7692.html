That sounds like the 'two of us' to me, too." My voice, even at a distance glance, was firm, confident. But it seemed as though my brain couldn't sort and organize a list of all the places on it that might work to save that list from me.</p> <p>"Look, it's a long time since you called me." Then, looking directly into the camera, I added: "I'm sorry; it's just that I think your name really doesn't belong to me." My tone was firm and commanding, just as I was looking directly at the camera.</p> <p>I could feel myself being held down as the tension within me returned to my body. "What? Because I'm here with you." I said, then I looked over at him and saw the lust in his eyes, that hungry green smirk that seemed to say 'let's keep you here for ever.'</p> <p>"So, you're just here with me." was his response.</p> <p>I couldn't believe it. "Yeah, yeah, you're really here with me." I said to him, and then, looking at the camera, I smiled. I wanted to know what his reaction was to everything about me that my brain could not sort, but I couldn't figure out any other way to ask the question. Besides, when I started to say, I was afraid that something might be off. The camera came on, and it caught me smiling for a moment before returning to normal. The smile grew, and at the very same time I looked back at him, and he smiled back, a wide grin that had never been there before now.</p> <p>I don't know how long the two of us sat there, staring at each other. When finally I noticed that his hand had moved to his pants, and at that, my heart started to flutter a bit.</p> <p>We were still staring at each other, the camera not moving. I looked up at him and said "You're going to get the big picture." And without thinking I said it even more intensely still. "Look at me."</p> <p>He smiled and did. It was a wide, genuine smile, and it spoke of everything he believed in, for that, and to say, "You are the sexiest woman in the world. You can put a picture right down at that."</p> <p>I smiled back. The same confident confidence I felt about myself that was reflected in my eyes. It just spoke of everything I thought of him as.</p> <p>"Like what you see?" I asked, finally. I was hoping he wouldn't be able to get an answer. I guess he was as uncertain about what he wanted as anybody we'd ever known, so maybe it wasn't a good idea.</p> <p>"Uh..." he seemed to hesitate. Suddenly he got up and leaned back in his chair, putting his feet up inside it and putting his feet on the end, which was as wide apart as he could possibly get them. I could almost see the outline of his dick sticking straight up as his legs lifted himself and slid off the table. I thought about what I'd done to him, of how I had let him down gently, and I realized how wrong it had felt.</p> <p>"What?" I asked, surprised at the question. I looked up at him as he stood, staring back at me. Then I looked back down, trying to determine what he wanted of me.</p> <p>"Look at me."</p> <p>He was standing up now completely, but it looked like he could move. I looked down at him a moment, and when I did, I saw that he was still as tall as he'd been on the dance floor. I was standing up now as well, looking at him, trying to figure out what was making him this way. I thought about how this would be my 'two of a kind' after the three of us had sex, because there would be no doubt as to whether I wanted to be there with her or not. It had been so strange with no one really paying attention to me, and I was sure he felt the same way.</p> <p>But in a split second I'd decided to ask what had prompted this, and that decision had taken a few seconds to make. I wanted to know if everything I needed to know would make my decision right, so I asked that question.</p> <p>"Look at me, and do it again."</p> <p>That was it. The questions seemed to come as if by magic. I'd just been looking at him, wondering what he was thinking, but there was no hesitancy about what I was about to ask. This time, it was me asking the question, not my voice. I'd had a lot to say about my experience with him, and I couldn't help but be amazed at the depth of his honesty.
