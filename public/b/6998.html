The more I considered it, the more I felt that I had a deep feeling for her. She was so beautiful, even in the morning light.</p> <p>She looked back into my eyes and said, "Come on, get that stuff out of the truck while I make us breakfast. It's gonna be hot."</p> <p>"Thanks, you're really nice."</p> <p>That night, I was up before her and helped her with her breakfast. As we ate, she told me all about how she was going to break up school at the middle of her senior year, but was going to be transferring back to the states in a few months. I agreed that I would probably want to be her dad.</p> <p>"You're not married anymore, are you?"</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Me neither?"</p> <p>"No, but I don't know if it will work, maybe she can give me a chance to get back with my friend or something to let me know that we can work this out."</p> <p>"That would be cool."</p> <p>"I can tell."</p> <p>We finished breakfast, I was still feeling a little tired, so I suggested we go for a walk to get rid of the sleep shorts. She agreed and we walked a little farther away from the house. I told her to get the key out of the drawer and set it down so we could go back to our room. She put her arms around my waist as we headed back out the door. I let her go on her own and we made camp in the dirt where she had been sleeping just a few minutes earlier.</p> <p>We had about our third glass of wine when she said, "I guess I should be going."</p> <p>"No," was all I said to her when I got back to the truck.</p> <p>"Good," she replied and turned off the lights in the house.</p> <p>About twenty minutes later, we heard the shower turn on. When she got out of the shower, I had to get her to get in the cabin without me getting to her. About a half hour later, I got her into her bunk bed and I pulled out the towels and took them back to our room. I also pulled off her top, but left a piece of fabric that allowed me to feel her breasts, which were still mostly soft.</p> <p>She didn't know that at the time, but she knew I couldn't hear very well. Once I had her top off and her breasts were free, I gently kneaded her nipples. Her breasts quickly hardened and her nipples got more sensitive. When I moved my hands down to her waist to remove her bottoms, her breasts began to bounce a little before she gave in. In a matter of moments, we both had a light but intense orgasm, probably because of the wine, and probably because I was so aroused that while the night wasn't over, it wasn't over.</p> <p>"Let's get back to our room."</p> <p>"I'm ready for it, I've been sleeping for almost an hour."</p> <p>"Let's go."</p> <p>We went back to the house and I set up the towels. When we came back to our room, we got in the shower together and she lathered me up with soap. I was so turned on, and she still had on the tank top. We just stood there for a second, soaking off the water, until I stepped up to her and kissed her, and she broke off the kiss and said, "Let's do this in my bed."</p> <p>We got into the shower together and spent our time together rubbing, kissing and licking each other under the spray. My body was responding to her breasts and to the sensations she was giving me. It wasn't long before she was so wet, it didn't take long to enter her. She was so wet that I slid in with ease and that time she was ready to take me over the edge with her fingers, and then she pulled me into herself. Her climax was intense and her climax lasted for an hour, and when it finally broke, she wasn't going to stop, and neither did I. As we cleaned ourselves up, she held my hand as we went back to her room. She quickly shut the door and she had a key on the key fob that she'd been carrying around with her because I knew her mother wouldn't lock the door.</p> <p>We got dressed quickly, and were just finishing breakfast in our room when we heard her door open and close. I was still trying to get my head around our situation, and I was nervous about leaving the cabin. But I found it very difficult. When she came out wearing a large towel over her body, I told her to get dressed before I was too late. She came overâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
