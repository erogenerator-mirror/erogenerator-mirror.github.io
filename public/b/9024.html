The bartender will give us the bartender's order if everyone agrees?"</p> <p>We all agreed on the bartender and headed back to the car to drive back to our cabin so we could take off when we were ready to hit the road.</p> <p>A couple of hours later I was back in bed and she was driving me to my house.</p> <p>We had had two more drinks so we had downed almost every single one. I went to sleep feeling I probably could have held her without falling out of the bed.</p> <p>I woke up the next morning about 8AM and realized what I had just done. I thought about taking a cold shower so I took my clothes off and had to relieve myself as quick as possible before getting in the shower.</p> <p>I came up to our cabin just before 9 and she went in first followed by her husband and another man at the bar. I saw a bottle of Jack in the other room and walked over to the bar. It was empty as I went in so I poured two drinks.</p> <p>"We decided that you had to do a lot in the last few weeks to keep things the same between you and me."</p> <p>She didn't say anything but her face reddened as she said, "I really am sorry about last night but I know what I will have to do to get you back. I'm going to do my best to seduce you so I won't ever leave you again."</p> <p>I just told her not to worry because I had planned on going home, but I took the lead and went to the bar and poured me a second drink before sitting down and getting myself another drink. It didn't take long for my body to respond to her again like it normally did and then it happened. She had her hand on my thigh and slowly lifted her head so she could look at me.</p> <p>"Last night was wonderful. We'll definitely need to do this again soon."</p> <p>With that I pulled my zipper down and my hand slowly slid into her panties.</p> <p>Her head rocked back toward her man so she could see him but she didn't lift her head away, it was just her eyes that were fixed on me.</p> <p>I let go of her and she quickly turned her face away and looked back at me. I saw the desire in those dark eyes but it didn't bother me, in fact, it turned me on to know that she wanted me as much as I wanted her.</p> <p>Just then we saw that two men were coming toward the door and they were asking for our table.</p> <p>As we got to the table she said, "Don't sit down right away, I have a surprise for you."</p> <p>She slid her way to the end of the booth away from the other men and leaned up against his legs and started to unzip his pants. She slowly pulled them down and as his cock was freed she leaned further down as I pulled my shirt over my head and tossed it aside so she could see my new toy.</p> <p>As she started to lick the head of his cock she slid his pants even further down and looked back up at me. "I know you are waiting to see this one when we get back."</p> <p>I leaned back across the chair so she could get a good shot at it, but I really wanted to watch her pussy so it was more of a turn on to have her licking his large head like she had me lick hers as he watched.</p> <p>With the head of his cock between her waiting lips she used one hand to help him part her lips and slowly started to lick the very tip of his cock as my wife's tongue played with me.</p> <p>While she was giving him what he desired she started to take more and more of him into her mouth. "Oh, yes, suck it, suck it. Now deeper, deeper."</p> <p>She slowly ran her tongue against the underside of his large head while I was standing there watching.</p> <p>She continued to work his cock in and out of her mouth as she ran her hand up and down its huge length.</p> <p>As much as I wanted to be watching my wife doing the work of another man, I didn't want to watch her and she knew it as her hand slipped down my zipper and started to rub on my cock.</p> <p>I got another rock hard hard cock watching a man who only knew her sucking it while her legs were wrapped around his legs, moving to and fro.</p> <p>She stopped and turned her body so I could see her face in profile to him. She looked up at him but didn't say anything or look away. The head of his cock was just inches from her lips as she kept moving her head up and down, each time she would engulf a quarter inch moreâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
