I reached out and started running my fingers through her hair. It was a soft and sweet smell. The smell of a woman in heat, a woman so hot for me, needed me. I had never been unfaithful and now, this is what I was going to do, to take her and make her mine. The thought of it sent shivers down my spine. I ran my fingers through it, running over her scalp. My fingers slipped down between her breasts and I stroked the underside of her left breast. I ran my left hand round it, squeezing and stroking her nipple. She seemed to like that. I reached a hand back down again, slipping it back between her legs and my middle finger slipped in between her lips and over her clit. I flicked the tip over her clit as I slid my wet finger upwards and pressed my finger into her.</p> <p>She started bucking against my hand. She was still moaning and groaning all over. She was hot, my pussy was hot and ready. I stopped again and turned her over and began running my mouth over hers. I kissed her slowly and deeply and her tongue slid into my mouth when I did. She wrapped her arms around my neck, her face grinding into my neck. Her tongue was exploring my mouth and the taste of her lips was exquisite. I let my hands slide down her back and cup her ass. She stiffened against me and I could hardly breathe. She grabbed my wrist and pulled it down. "Fuck me you bastard!" she yelled. She lifted her head and kissed me again. I pulled her up and turned her over on her knees. She looked so delicious. She smiled her sweet smile. "I want fucked!" she said and turned down the bed.</p> <p>I walked over to the dresser. I bent down and picked up a double-ended dildo. It looked like a strap-on one, except wider - but that's another story. I walked back over to the bed. The dildo was about seven inches long, just above the knee, and wider than that. The end of the double-ended dick was about three inches above the knee. I took it and laid back on the bed on my stomach. My legs were up and spread open and I reached my hands up to the fake cock. It was shiny like glass. I gently pushed the tip of the dick back into my wet pussy. It had swollen to a good size and it had a silky head. I began sliding the dildo around inside me while the strap-on was sliding around in my pussy. I could feel the tip of the head pushing against the opening of my ass. I looked under my right shoulder and could see my reflection, I was in a mirror. I looked back at the reflection of how close she had approached my pussy and how tight she must have been! She was a stranger, a stranger from the world of men. She had never been able to give me what I needed so I knew what she was offering herself to be. I just knew that if she didn't want me to take her in the ass, then I didn't want to be the recipient. She had to be in her forties, and she was my age, and she had a wonderful body. Maybe fifty! It was hard to say right then.</p> <p>I started taking the fake cock in and out, making long strokes. I could tell I was getting close. "Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me!" She had a pleading look in her eyes and I felt like I was losing my mind. I pushed the dildo against her ass and then she pushed back, taking the two inch cock deep into her. "Fuck me!" she said. "Fuck me hard! Fuck me as hard as you can!"</p> <p>That was it. I started panting and she pushed the dildo deep into my pussy. The two of us bucked together as a new orgasm shook and surged through my body. She moaned very contentedly at the feeling of my pussy being filled up by the dildo. She looked up at me and smiled. "Fuck me hard, fuck me, fuck me!"</p> <p>I was surprised how hard my orgasm was going to be. I had never been this turned on before. My entire body was tingling. My whole body was alive. She had never been this into rough sex before. As the waves of pleasure kept crashing through my body, my breathing slowly returning to normal, I was thinking that maybe I should have let the strap-on out and just taken it in and done it. It didn't seem right, but I'd seen how much she had enjoyed herself on the dildo - she was taking full advantage of it. I wasn't sure at first that I was ready to do the thing.</p> <p>But the fact was I needed something bigger than just my finger inside me. I neededâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
