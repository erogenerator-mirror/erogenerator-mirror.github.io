Mike reassured her.</p> <p>He kissed her again but now she wasn't responding.</p> <p>"Go on then." Mike said, again reassuring her.</p> <p>She kissed him back. Her hand snaked round his neck and she pulled his head down. Mike held her firmly and kissed her neck, moving his head to nuzzle at the soft flesh. She pressed herself against him. She moaned in pleasure as he took it to her breasts and sucked at her nipples through her blouse. She lifted her skirt up giving him a quick glimpse of pink lace. She felt his hand move up her thigh again and she felt that finger pushing itself into her. There was no resistance, just a soft, wet feeling. She was soaking and she parted a leg for his hand. When he reached for her he lifted her skirt again. She didn't want to stop him. She opened her legs as far as they would let her and he stroked her with gentle strokes, feeling the heat and the wetness. This time however he pushed his fingers further into her. He kissed at her lips, sucking on her neck. Her hand came up to massage at her breasts.</p> <p>"I can't." She gasped.</p> <p>"Please." He whispered and took her by the hand.</p> <p>"Are you ok?"</p> <p>"Yes but I'm not ok." she said. She was getting aroused and he could see her hand was pressing against his belly, her fingers running lightly with her nails over his skin.</p> <p>"Yes, do you like it?"</p> <p>"Oh I do like it. It's just a little different than last time." She groaned and pushed herself back into him.</p> <p>Mike moved to take off his pants, feeling the slight dampness.</p> <p>"I think this can be a good place for you to go all the time." He said when he slid out of his underwear, and watched his erection. He felt for her panties.</p> <p>"Are?" She said, and slipped them on, then pulled her skirt down.</p> <p>"Yes, in here it's the best place." She said and lifted him by his cock and turned him round.</p> <p>"I don't need a skirt. I know its wet."</p> <p>"Not just wet and messy."</p> <p>She pushed him towards the bedroom and he didn't argue. Once in, she put on a condom and held him by his cock, and positioned herself over him. She watched the way his cock penetrated her with gentle thrusts. Mike's cock was so hard and deep and he looked at her as she lowered herself onto him. He could feel the walls of her pussy tightening around him and he felt the movement of her body against his. The softness of her lips was the best part he had to look forward to. She bent over and he watched in amazement as he entered her. She was so wet and slick that he slid in without much trouble as he reached her cervix where his cock head stretched her open.</p> <p>"No, not tonight." He whispered in surprise.</p> <p>"Oh don't worry baby we'll get away with this." And she kissed him and he felt her breasts against his chest. As long as there was a condom, then a different kind of sex. She kissed him again.</p> <p>"How did you know my birth control code? How do you know it was my period?" she asked.</p> <p>"The clinic you checked in. They said it's ok."</p> <p>A smile of relief crossed her face and she felt happier than she'd ever felt in her life for some reason. Her hand went to her breast and she cupped it, squeezing gently.</p> <p>"Have you had any other tests done when your period started?" She asked.</p> <p>"No, it's just been a bit busy."</p> <p>"It feels better to be honest."</p> <p>"I know but it's a bit more uncomfortable."</p> <p>"Ok, but I don't want to rush it."</p> <p>"That's ok, it has been about six hours." She felt his cock sliding in and out of her. His hands found her breasts again and caressed them as he thrusts faster. He was getting close, and she pushed herself up to him, meeting him thrust for thrust. He could feel her pussy tightening against him, his own orgasm starting.</p> <p>"Are you coming?" She whispered.</p> <p>"Yes." He mumbled into her mouth.</p> <p>Her hand went to a breast. He could feel it hardening under his fingers.</p> <p>"Are you coming?" Mike asked again, as it felt like the dam was breaking inside him. He couldn't hold on another minute of this and he felt himself erupting into her. Their mouths met again and he could feel their bodies tremble againstâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
