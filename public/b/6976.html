She could feel the tension in Brian's body, his shoulders, his chest, the slight curve of his waist, and the roundness of his belly. She imagined taking the whole of him into her mouth, swallowing until he came, the tip of his cock being swallowed by her throat. She loved her time with him, and it was the best way a girl could give him a blow-job.</p> <p>They both enjoyed their time together. But it was something that could never be repeated. It could never be for them. They would never see each other again, both physically and mentally.</p> <p>They both enjoyed the company of each other. It was an art that made their relationship more special than anything else. They knew exactly what another woman thought of in their moment. They both hoped their relationship would never be the same, but at the same time they knew that if this happened they could never leave each other. They knew that if this happened that their relationship would never end.</p> <p>They both knew that one day, a girl would wake up to the feel of a cock in her pussy or a hard cock in her mouth. They would kiss again before they fell asleep, holding the other's hand as they went to sleep. But until then that would be the last time they would wake up together.</p> <p>*</p> <p>This is a work of fiction. The characters are a little more than half of the way through. Thank you.</p> <p>*</p> <p>***</p> <p>The girl and boy had come together so many times, it was almost scary. Their eyes met in the mirror, for a brief instant, but their relationship had always been more permanent than anything else. They were young adults and they had grown up together. This was their first time together. Brian, his girlfriend, the man that had changed their lives and brought them together.</p> <p>It was the first time that she had ever had sex with anyone. For several years they had experimented with each other. Brian had never been with anyone else, and had been reluctant to make a move in any way. However, by the time he had been married he had found someone who understood how he felt. They had gone their separate ways for several years, but in the end it was always a happy time for both of them. Their passion for each other had grown strong, and even though they had been separated for months, Brian had found the spark in their relationship, something that he could never do. Perhaps it was because of his love for her, perhaps it was her passion of love. But his curiosity had driven him to bring her there. And the only time in his life he had done anything to her, or to herself, had been to the dance, because he felt that dancing and dancing alone with her was as much of an intimate relationship as with a man. And the way she moved her body in the way that he liked made it easy for him to do to her whatever he wished.</p> <p>His thoughts kept returning to the dance. He still felt the love that she had for him in some intangible way, but he couldn't put that off from her. After all, it was just a dance. Brian was sure that he would be dancing with her forever, but that was just the beginning.</p> <p>Brian had loved her when he was young, and he was not sure that he would ever see her again. Now he would be forever in bed with her too. And he would never want to be separated from her again. He still looked at her with love and adoration, but there was something else that he couldn't quite put his finger on. Something deeper. And that was the end of the dance.</p> <p>It was not long before she became the centre of his thoughts each night. With each step down the aisle there had been an overwhelming feeling in his groin. The feel of her breasts in the palms of his hands, the feel of her naked body in his arms. His mind had raced as he remembered the dancing. He would have sworn that he had felt something for her then. Somehow he had always doubted it. But that had vanished before it ever became something of a real possibility. They had been a couple for a lot longer than they could have imagined a couple. Their dance together was the last, everything else had gone, but not for long.</p> <p>He had spent several nights over the past several months thinking of her, of the way she looked in the mirror, of the way her body curved around him. After the dance they had kissed goodbye, and in a way, they had become lovers again. No longer did she feel the emotion of his love for her as in the weeks that followed. They were lovers, not a couple. It had all been a set-up. They had known who they were before it hit them, and they still loved each other. Brian, however, didn't have the will to say oneâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
