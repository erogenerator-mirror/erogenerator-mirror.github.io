I asked.</p> <p>Pam walked over and sat in my lap facing me.</p> <p>"I think she came home tired because of the pain and hurt she was feeling. We both had so much to eat that day I had to eat before I could even walk again. I'm not sure why I did it, but I couldn't do anything about it. She felt so dirty. What made me so mad was knowing that even though we hadn't spent all day making love, I had to go on, because of the pain she suffered at the end of it."</p> <p>"I wish she had worn a skirt." I murmured.</p> <p>Pam blushed and smiled to herself.</p> <p>"Is that really the truth?" She asked.</p> <p>"Yes and the truth is she is just my type of woman. She was the one who went out on a limb with the money in there and the fact that she had a job that paid off the mortgage, was not a reason for her to be walking."</p> <p>Pam giggled.</p> <p>"And do you think they'll think anything but me when they see how my butt looks with those panty lines?" She joked.</p> <p>"I'm sure she's not the only one in my mind." I replied as I stroked her cheek gently. "And I'm sure as hell not the first person to feel that the way she does." I added kissing her lightly.</p> <p>"Do you hate her for not trusting you?" She asked, sitting on my lap pulling my face to hers.</p> <p>"Is it okay if I do?" I asked kissing her gently.</p> <p>"We'll find another way to tell her and I'm sure she feels the same way as you do." She said with a soft smile.</p> <p>Pam's face was angelic and innocent looking and it made my heart sink more. I couldn't believe that a woman could ever let me love her and not do anything about it. That, and the fact that she was walking on two legs.</p> <p>"You don't have to do this if you don't want to." I said softly.</p> <p>"I'm not sure I'm ready to make some new woman with a hard ass." Pam said as she pulled me down and pulled my shirt over my head.</p> <p>"That's because I haven't made you feel like that since I got into college." I replied as she pulled both my pants and underwear down in one motion.</p> <p>She got up and turned around before I could even kick my sneakers from on top of my pants. I stood up and followed her back and watched as she hooked her thumbs around her skirt and pulled it up leaving the last of her clothing on. Pam dropped to her knees and grabbed my cock and began to stroke it with her hand to get me hard. I leaned back against the sofa as she moved to the center of the sofa. She looked up and our eyes met and she smiled knowing that she was now in control of me.</p> <p>"Are you ready to do what you're told?" She asked as she knelt in front of me in her heels.</p> <p>"Yes..." I whispered and felt the heat of her lips against my cock as she opened her lips taking me in her mouth. I'm not sure how long we were in there just enjoying each others first time. I reached down her head and grabbed her hair pulling her toward me. The motion brought her down on my hardening cock and she moaned around it as our lips met.</p> <p>Pam lifted her mouth off my cock long enough to say.</p> <p>"I'll do as you ask. Do you want a good fucking this time?"</p> <p>"Yes," I moaned as I took her chin in my hand and pulled her up off me.</p> <p>"Lie down again." She said as she stood and faced me.</p> <p>I did as I was told and watched as she straddled my legs and slid my cock back into her wet pussy. Slowly, I reached out and put my hand around the butt that had my cock inside her. I felt as soft as a babydoll as I pulled on her butt hole. Pushing, pulling, pressing, I continued to pull on the soft flesh until she lifted her hips so I could slide the head of my cock in between her butt cheeks.</p> <p>"Do you want me to move up so you can kiss me or is that too tight?" Pam asked as she lowered herself onto my cock.</p> <p>"Let me just be on it." I said as I turned my head kissing her.</p> <p>"Good, because tonight, the night you're going to give me what I want and have in bed for the rest of your life." Was all sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
