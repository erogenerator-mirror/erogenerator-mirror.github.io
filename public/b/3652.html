Not a single day comes near when you do as I ask. You are now fully in command of the situation, and it is all you will be able to do to hold back at any time. This is the same for me, but when you do not allow me to hold back, there is a whole new force to the situation.</p> <p>It's not that the circumstances are different, it's just that sometimes you seem to have no control at all, and yet you allow me to take what ever I want. That being said, I will say a whole lot more about myself and my sexuality at an end, but let's not get bogged down now. Suffice it to say, it's a feeling I can't describe adequately.</p> <p>This morning, I had my usual coffee and took a shower. I had made my way down to the coffee shop just off the University Campus and was chatting with a nice young lady, the girl I work with. I had been away for the last two weeks and had come to my senses. I was feeling sorry for myself.</p> <p>The guy sitting next to me had already left the coffee shop and was in fact coming around to my booth to talk to my guest. As I spoke to the girl I looked over to her and her head was in the other's lap. I looked back at the man next to me and realized, or should I say, thought, it all started with the man's hand touching my thigh.</p> <p>I quickly turned my thoughts back to the new and exciting situation at hand. I quickly made one more suggestion. 'Who am I talking to here?'</p> <p>The girl looked up and looked at me and smiled. 'Yes, sorry, John, you are my husband.'</p> <p>'What exactly do you mean?'</p> <p>'I mean what we have here is an ordinary couple, an ordinary married couple.'</p> <p>'But you are two very beautiful people, isn't that what we discussed?' I said as I placed my coffee cup back on the table.</p> <p>'Oh yes, we enjoy each other tremendously.' I replied, then added the second word, 'I mean you seem to be as much fun for us as you are for each other.'</p> <p>'We certainly do enjoy each other.' She replied.</p> <p>'Oh, I thought so. Well, we would like to know, would you?' I said.</p> <p>'Ok, I'll leave you two with each other.'</p> <p>Well, then, for the first time I thought if I could make something, I could probably get together with my boss and have three great-looking women at once?' I pondered the dilemma of how to talk about that situation. I was hoping to make it with someone else, I wanted to have an interesting experience with three gorgeous women, it had been a long week. I wasn't sure about the third, but I wanted to be with her anyway, as it was something I wanted to do. I decided that she would have to have sex with John.</p> <p>To my surprise, she got up and walked around to the opposite side of the table from me, where I sat. 'I'm sorry, but that was no way of asking for a coffee. I'm sorry John.' She said.</p> <p>'No, it wasn't too long for us. I know it's not really my business and you're my wife, but I just wanted to ask' I replied.</p> <p>'Don't you mean to want a coffee? Of course I do.' She replied.</p> <p>'Yes yes I did.' I replied.</p> <p>'John, I don't know what you mean when you say, but this is an ordinary domestic relationship, the kind of thing you two might not like to be doing.' She added, and, with that, she stood and walked away.</p> <p>I looked at the table and noticed that her skirt had risen far enough to allow a view of her ass. The other woman, I noticed that she had put on some heavy mascara and lipgloss, the other woman was dressed completely in black.</p> <p>'It is ok, just don't push it too far, it would be fun.' I said to her.</p> <p>'I'm sure we won't have to push it any harder than you have.' She retorted. 'But you don't have to say more if you don't want to.' Then, she added. 'I'm no prude, I think we should make ourselves comfortable, that's if you don't mind my husband taking the opportunity to look at my body.'</p> <p>I felt that she was right, after some initial hesitation he came over to our table and sat next to me. Before I knew it we had our coffee and our conversation began to resume. She told me that she wasn't ashamed or self-conscious regarding her personal and sexual habits.
