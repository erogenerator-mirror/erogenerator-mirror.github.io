I want something from you, something I've wanted since before we were married. Something you can't just abandon me. There's still time for me to be a better, much sexier wife. Something that I know you will want. Now, go upstairs and sit in that big, green chair."</p> <p>I nodded at him and went upstairs, trying to keep my head down to avoid looking at him. When I came to my bedroom I quickly took off my bathrobe and then sat in the chair beside it.</p> <p>Paulie took his chair and sat in it.</p> <p>"You can't just leave me like this like this. Go stand in front of me and take off your robe. Slowly and gently. I want to see the body that you've always wanted."</p> <p>I went to slowly and quietly and took off my bathrobe. Now fully nude, I sat in the chair and faced Paul. He stood and pulled off his shirt and shorts, looking me over from time to time, his dark hair lightly covering his chest and back.</p> <p>After a few minutes he stood, and I looked over at him. His penis was hard and proud, pointing straight at me. His eyes burned directly into mine, his mouth hung open and his hand slowly moved up and down his long, long shaft.</p> <p>"Kneel down in front of me. I want to feel your warmth inside."</p> <p>I obeyed and lay down in front of him. He grabbed my hair and pulled my head up until he had my face, nose and eye-to-eye. He leaned forward and began pressing kisses on me softly, his breath coming in short, sharp bursts of kisses all over me.</p> <p>"I love you," he whispered into my ear "please don't think that I don't love you. That's what this morning is about. I love you." He kissed me lightly on my cheek and then pulled away.</p> <p>"I can't. You have to go. I don't want you in the worst of moods." He took my hand and pulled me up and sat me on the bed.</p> <p>I felt very nervous, like I didn't belong there and he was in me. Then I noticed that his hand was in his lap and he was playing with his penis.</p> <p>"I've wanted to do this for awhile. I didn't realize I had this little fetish. But the whole thing is just a fantasy. I've always wanted to do this."</p> <p>"You don't think I want to do this," he said, looking me in the eye, "it isn't what I want."</p> <p>"You don't need to know everything," I said. "All you have to know is..."</p> <p>"Oh, yeah. I do. I do."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Really," he said, "do you know what happens then?"</p> <p>I stared at him. He nodded his head. "Good," he said, "Because if you don't then there will be hell to pay." He looked away.</p> <p>"Come on," he continued. "There's lots of things you can do to me. So tell me, did you cum with my wife?"</p> <p>I stared at him. He held his head and looked down at his penis. "It's my wife's fault. I'm going to have an affair with her."</p> <p>"And you'd make sure that if you could, she didn't fuck anyone else."</p> <p>I reached down and grabbed his penis and squeezed it. "If I could make her stay with you, I'm sure I could."</p> <p>He looked at me. "I think she would want me if I didn't do this. She'd love to have sex with you."</p> <p>"Don't think about her," I said softly. "It wouldn't be a risk."</p> <p>He leaned close and kissed me, pushing his tongue into my mouth. A few minutes later he stood and came to me.</p> <p>"Kneel on the bed."</p> <p>I stood.</p> <p>"Kneel," he said again. I knelt. He pulled me into him and kissed me again.</p> <p>"When she wakes up I want to get my tongue in her mouth."</p> <p>I kissed him again. He pulled away and looked at me. "You did very well here, sweetheart."</p> <p>We kissed several more times, and then he picked me up again and let me slide out of his arms. I stood and walked slowly to the center of the room. A woman stood in a room across the hall from my bedroom. I looked down at her.</p> <p>"Hi," she said. "Is this your husband?"
