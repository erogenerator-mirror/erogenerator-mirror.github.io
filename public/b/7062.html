"It's like a game. It's not like I'm a total stranger to this kind of thing..." And then I laughed out loud at the idea of it all.</p> <p>"Yes you are. You're probably getting the picture, baby. You are a little nervous, aren't you? That's a good sign."</p> <p>She smiled at the thought; her hand was now stroking up and down my thigh lightly. "No, baby... I'm getting the picture, though, right? No... that's a bad sign. Not quite bad - I mean, you are very kind, but... we just went a bit too far."</p> <p>My hand slid to rest on her hip, not wanting to be rude. "I don't think so. It's so hot!"</p> <p>"Maybe... but you can tell, baby. I mean, what... what do you mean, 'we just went too far?'"</p> <p>"Maybe I don't know. Perhaps... it's not exactly something you're asking," I said as I slid my hand up and brought it to rest on her bare thigh.</p> <p>"We should have never done it. I certainly hadn't thought of it that way," she said as our lips found each other and we kissed each other very softly. Her smile grew as our kiss developed. "This must feel pretty good," she said as she pulled the top of my shirt over my head. "What about you?"</p> <p>"Yes... I'm feeling pretty good. Very good," I replied. "I can see why everyone thinks we were so eager last time."</p> <p>She laughed at my words, but my mind was still thinking of just how good it feels to have a woman's lips all over my body. As she kissed me, she slid my shirt off and I let it slide to the floor. When she saw how I was dressed, she reached up and pulled the straps of my bra down. I pulled my arms free and she pushed it from my body.</p> <p>"Very nice," she said. "Hormones are really good. I really like the feel of your skin. It feels so soft." Her lips moved back to mine and she kissed me again. As her kiss continued, I could tell she was caressing every inch of my body. "So soft... You're so smooth. I mean, if you could get hard like that, I wouldn't complain, would I?" Her hand pulled my bra out of the pile of clothes and I moved my hips to let it fall away from my body. The feeling of her hand on my breasts made me gasp. "There. Now you're not so hard, are you?"</p> <p>"No," I said as if it wasn't a strange question. "Just... very nice... and sexy."</p> <p>"I do like that about you." She pulled the bra off of me and then knelt in front of me. Her mouth moved to the left side of my breasts and then the right one. "Did you like what she did to you?"</p> <p>"Um..." No, that's not really necessary," I said as her kisses grew harder on my breasts. I loved it. "I can tell... I want to do that again right now," she said as her fingers moved up to take the hem of my shorts and it slid easily up my legs and over my butt and on to my thighs. She had my thighs spread wide so that her fingers could find just the bare fleshy mound of my sex. The feeling of her hand stroking me pushed me right to the edge. She leaned back while her lips kissed my breasts once again. "You are amazing, baby. You are so sexy... and sexy." Her hands slid back to slide my panties back over my hips. "You are incredible."</p> <p>"Thank you," I said softly. "That was incredible,"</p> <p>"You said I could get hard all over again," she said as her fingers slid slowly up and down my body and stopped at my lips. "Does that feel like I can get you hard again?"</p> <p>"Yes," I said as my hips moved in rhythm with her hand. "Yes, I can," I replied as I lifted my head slightly. "You're making me so hard."</p> <p>"Well, I know you could get to the top again," she said moving her hand to cup my balls in the palm of her other hand. I felt her palm moving gently in a circle as she touched my balls. "Mmm... they're full."</p> <p>"Mmm-mmmm," was all I said as she pulled my hands to her breasts and held me in place. She kissed me again before her hand left my balls.
