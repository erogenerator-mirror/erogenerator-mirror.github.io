He took his turn fucking his friend. But it was one time, one guy fucking a woman. Not the sort of thing you would go for with a stranger. That is what he would have told my wife if she had found out. I saw something in his eyes that made me realize I had a little too much respect for him.</p> <p>I had no idea it would be the same the next day, but I wasn't going to complain. If he wasn't as beautiful and desirable as his wife and had a bigger cock than his friend, then I wasn't going to have to go the other way. He said that I got a bigger dick then my friend. He had told my wife how much he had been turned on by her as he fucked her. She told him he could do the same.</p> <p>"I love sucking cock. I loved seeing my big cock up the girls tight little cunt. I've wanted to suck on one and then fuck the other. Then we could try out their cocks and then each other." I told her. And I know she did just as I had told her.</p> <p>"If this makes you comfortable then just say so. No judgement is going to be made on that anyway. This is one time only. And it won't be as long as you want it to be." I said. Then I got serious and asked if she would like me to stop seeing her.</p> <p>"Would it make you feel uncomfortable if I told you I had sex with a stranger just to suck on his cock?" she asked. Then she did laugh at what I thought had happened. And I'm sure I was looking at her too.</p> <p>"No, you don't really have to. I'd really love that, if you would." I told her. And a little smile crept across her face. It had taken a long time for me to even notice it. I was still staring at her. She looked at me and smiled then, as if she knew what I wanted.</p> <p>"Would you like to go back to watching those two? They were good. You do like watching them?" I asked her. And she nodded her head in agreement.</p> <p>"If you want to go out again in less time, that is up to you." I wanted to make the conversation easy. She was still smiling but she didn't seem to be upset.</p> <p>"What you were going to say was OK. But I don't know if we'd have the time to go to dinner again." She asked me.</p> <p>"I think we'll just go to my place. I mean, I was kind of hoping to talk with you a little bit. This was too weird for me to get out of the house without going. Maybe tomorrow if we don't have to be at work." I said. She smiled at that.</p> <p>"I might even go out with some friends tomorrow night!" She said, then I felt like maybe it might even be my wife. My friend might have gotten the message, but my wife would feel weird if she went out alone tomorrow.</p> <p>As we got ready for dinner, I told her we had to make a decision on what to wear. That was the first thing she said since dinner.</p> <p>She knew I had said no more then that but had no way of knowing that I meant it. And I loved the way she looked. She looked gorgeous, sexy and available. I got ready and found a nice suit. But this particular one was a little larger. It fit much tighter and showed lots of skin. As I walked over to her to wear it, I felt the need to tell her that this was what I wanted.</p> <p>"OK, I guess we'll do it. Maybe you have to take care of me tomorrow night." She said simply. And I knew she had.</p> <p>I looked over at her then and saw a twinkle in her eyes. I just smiled and looked at the suit. I thought she was going to say something else or suggest we go to her place again. But she smiled again and said,</p> <p>"Maybe I do!" then she picked up her phone. She didn't look at me now but waited while I checked it again. "You like that?" she said, smiling up at me.</p> <p>"It's nice. Maybe later you can show me some more." I said, trying to sound confident.</p> <p>"OK. Let me know what you think. I think you can go ahead and find something nice and sexy to wear tomorrow. We'll have some time. But for now, I want you to just tell me everything, OK?" she said. So I did just that. And that ended it. But I felt a little better afterward.</p> <p>She came home a little after one and said that she had toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
