At first I held back, I really didn't know what to do, was I really going to let this happen to her? As it turned out it was more than that and it was all it could take. When I finished it had been fantastic. I was feeling a little guilty about doing it, but I knew she needed it.</p> <p>She came to me and we hugged and kissed, and then we walked downstairs to sit on my couch. We sat just like that. After what happened, we started to talk. I asked her if she thought about anything in particular about this relationship.</p> <p>She responded, "I've always fantasized about having a threesome. I mean not as a woman, or as a man, but now I actually think about it, and it is just so exciting to me. Especially if it can be my husband watching us." She was quiet for a while and then she said, "It's getting late and I want to go to bed," She was walking in the direction of the bathroom.</p> <p>I got up and started to get dressed. As I was pulling on my shoes, I noticed a very serious look on her face. I smiled at her and watched her walk across the living room, not a word came out. She looked at me as she passed and told me when she got back. We kissed on her hand.</p> <p>I walked her to the door and we walked back to the couch. We sat there for another few minutes and then she got to her knees and kissed me. We kissed for a while and I could taste the tangy taste of her mouth on my lips. I kissed her and she kissed me some more. We broke off our kiss and stood up.</p> <p>We kissed again and then she took me back into the bedroom. She turned it down and I got on the bed. I was nervous and excited at the same time. She pushed me up on my back and pulled my shirt off over my head. She kissed me all over my chest before finally working right on my nipples. She was really teasing, but she was really turned on. After she teased me a long time, she took me in her mouth, she used her hands to rub it. When she finally got me to full hardness, she went back to teasing me with that talented mouth.</p> <p>She sucked me with purpose and I was close to exploding. She knew just when to stop. I grabbed her by the back of my head and held her up a little and said, "I am so close baby, make love to me." She started to cry and that made me hotter. She was so wet. She tasted so good and she made me feel beautiful. I took a quick shower and crawled in bed with her.</p> <p>I held this beautiful woman in my arms and we slept like that for about 5 hours until we could feel it. It was amazing. The first time I had ever seen a movie. We slept in each other's arms. I could feel her arms around me. I could feel her body next to me. I kissed her and we made love again.</p> <p>She was insatiable. We could feel the urgency of each kiss. We couldn't hold ourselves back any longer. We ended up making love 3 more times that night and that is when I decided it was time to move on. She wanted it so bad it hurt, but we worked around it. We made love again that night. I'm sure it lasted forever. Our sex life never ceases to surprise me. We never knew we were going to have sex in front of anyone else.</p> <p>When we left in the morning she had this big grin on her face and she said, "We're going to have so much fun." She kissed me goodbye and we got out of bed and she got a note to come back tomorrow.</p> <p>I started to get up and she had me take a shower. I knew I had to get her something for our first night. Once I got her ready she laid down in front of me, but we didn't make love. She woke me up and took me into the bedroom and laid me down, she kissed my mouth again and got behind me. I could feel her breath on my legs and I could feel a little trail trail. She took the rest and kissed me again. She kissed her way down my body, finally at the end of my neck. She kissed my breasts gently. Then she took them both in her hands and then sucked them. It was magical. She just held each of them. She loved the way they felt in her hands. She slowly moved down my body and kissed and licked her way to my clit. She could feel every little bump on my clit and she licked and nibbled it. The last time we had done our 69 she had only let her fingers stay touching, for about a minute atâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
