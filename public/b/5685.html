And we're going to call you a cab."</p> <p>Tears stream down your face as you run out to my car. I want to cry but control myself. I am still angry. Angry to be a part of this, angry that they thought I was enjoying myself and yet angry at the betrayal. The thought of you makes me hurt, to be that angry.</p> <p>The cab sits in the garage and opens. I get out of the cab and go around to unlock the door. I unlock the door and get in, pulling up in first so they can come in too. The car starts and I pull out pulling you towards me, "I'm not going on any dates, I'm not. You promised you were going to call me when we are through. I'm just going to pick up. You still have no clothes on."</p> <p>My anger grows as I see you run up to the car.</p> <p>"I'm a married woman. I want to spend hours in an apartment getting to know my body. I'm not going off to work to keep you happy. I'm here for sex. And once you get off the hook you can be a happy slut."</p> <p>With that you reach up, grab a lock of my hair, pull me over you, kiss me hard, pulling me closer, trying to get our tongues to reach. I grind against you, trying to get more and more aroused. And you push my head down, so that my tongue hits your chest. Pulling my lips away, and lick around your nipples. I know you can feel how wet I am getting from your touch, wanting that rough touch. So I let my lips linger a moment before biting down. Your hands run up and down my back, making my body quiver. Pulling away, then back in, making me squirm. You want me? I want you so bad. I wanted you so bad!</p> <p>You pull away from my mouth and sit back, "So I guess I'll have to stop now."</p> <p>You take me between your legs, lifting me so that I'm not above your cock. I sit back down on you, and you pull me in for another kiss before putting my hands on your shoulders and moving my hips against yours, moving your cock in and out of me. You moan at my moans. I can feel how hard you are. You love seeing my body move and the wetness that covers us. You put your hand around my throat, pulling me close, kissing me as I push back into you. Just as I am going to call you a man, you pull away and sit up, smiling.</p> <p>"We need to go. There are other ways but we've got to be done now."</p> <p>I get off of you, walk back to my bedroom and throw everything off the dresser, throw it onto the bed. The sheets are a mess but I'm dressed with it. There is a note on the dresser.</p> <p>"I don't know what to do but I'm going to let you do this with me so we won't repeat this mistake."</p> <p></p> <p>My mind begins to drift as I realize we need to be quiet. I decide to go with this and we should just let you and me know what's going to take place. We have to be very careful, and get you off before we get interrupted.</p> <p>I reach for your cock. I want to rub up against me but I can't get past kissing you on the lips. We make out the whole time. Slowly at first, then with more intensity. I feel your cock growing in my hand.</p> <p>"Yes. I want you inside of me. I want you all."</p> <p>You pull my hair hard enough to hurt, "Oh god, I can't get off."</p> <p>"I need a man inside of me. You are so good to me. I need to be fucked and used. Don't worry, we'll let that happen. I'm not going to get pregnant but I don't know. You can't make me pregnant. I need you."</p> <p>You push harder now, wanting to hear more of that want on my part.</p> <p>"Yes. Yes please, oh god I want you right now. I need your cock. Please, I need you. I need your cock hard inside me."</p> <p>With that we are both on our knees. Your cock has swollen and you pull me closer as I get on my knees. I wrap my hand around it. I run my hand up and down your shaft while I hold on to it. You are holding me tight. I look up at you, and then look up at your face as you push me back over the end of the bed.
