Something new? You know, like the video games?"</p> <p>"I don't know," I said. "I was just playing it when I saw these photos and I was kind of taken by surprise."</p> <p>"Well that's so not fair, you know!" she said.</p> <p>"Yes it's, and so is this," I said, pulling down my track pants and releasing my seven-inch, circumcised cock. Before I knew what was happening I stood to my full eight inches. My hand could not get past her slender waste, and I could feel the dampness as it slid into her cunt.</p> <p>"No, no!" she said in a small voice, "I know, I know, it's not fair! You're the one that is a sex object!"</p> <p>"I am," I said as I stood to the side of her and took it in my hand.</p> <p>I looked down to where the head of my shaft was just a few inches from her soft lips, covered with her juices. I let my fingers wander back up and gently pulled her clitoris under the hood and into the opening of her cunt, moving back to that place behind her knees that I knew would be wet enough to take my dick. She didn't seem to have any trouble reaching for it, and she brought her hand up, touching the head and making a little 'peck' on her nipple.</p> <p>"No," was all that she said, she just wanted it.</p> <p>I took my hand away and moved in to her, sliding it out until just the head was in her. She looked down at it, and then back at me, and asked, "are you sure this is something you'd like?"</p> <p>"Oh, I certainly like," I said.</p> <p>"Good," she said, "I think I do as well."</p> <p>Slowly I pushed the head in, then back to her to get the fullness. At first, the head was just in her, then I moved forward. When I went forward this time, it went even further past the walls of her cunt. The wet, slick, warm lips were as tight around me as if I hadn't been in there when we first fucked each other, and as I pushed toward her, they opened to allow me a chance to get more inside her.</p> <p>All of a sudden she was going to climax, and all thoughts of it, for a second I thought it was all about the cumming thing. As it was, I couldn't just hold out any longer and wanted to experience something special as well as an experience for both of us. I leaned into her and pressed my body down on to hers, pressing the head of my penis against her cervix, pressing the end in to the opening of her cunt. After a moment or two, it was all at once, pressing in, then coming back out, then coming in again. Soon, she began to work me over and soon I was going, I knew, through her all the way and back again with my penis as deep as it would go, and I was holding myself tightly against her and I wanted to feel as much of her as I could. Suddenly she reached behind and around my back and pulled me against her face, burying it into the small of her back and holding me against her. As an aftershock of cum, she rolled me onto my back and kissed me. Her lips were so soft, so smooth and so warm and I thought, God, does she ever learn anything.</p> <p>"I've never had a better orgasm with a partner, I'll bet," she said, "I've never been with a woman as well equipped to allow my body. I have to tell you, it is nice to get out and get more comfortable. I can use my fingers now. But, please, come with me?</p> <p>"I can take two," I said. "I've never done that either."</p> <p>"I think there's nothing you'd rather do," she said, then she hugged me to her again and I kissed her as we hugged.</p> <p>"Thank you, but I can get out of your way before it gets too far up here," I said.</p> <p>"Oh, of course," was the only thing I had to say. Once we had stopped kissing, she was in a very different position, not from the floor, and her legs were spread wide and she had spread my legs and pushed them back to take me in with her as far as she could. Now I was completely in her and, if she really wanted me to fuck her there, I would have. I took a slow and easy stroke, which went on for a long period of time before she said to push down slightly and I slipped out.
