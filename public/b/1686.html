I felt suddenly awkward, because I had never been attracted to a man. The sex hadn't been on as great, had it?</p> <p>"Well?" he looked a little confused, "So if we're going to do this, we want to do something fun," he smiled, "so I guess we could take everything off in the car and go into the city and do some camping. Or, we could meet up in the park, and just enjoy some sun and hot cocoa." He added wistfully that it sounded to him like a lot of fun, I'd have to let him do that.</p> <p>He got me to agree to his fantasies one last time. We made plans to meet him there the next day. I got home early, and took a long, hot bubble bath. I shaved my legs and crotch to just a short triangle, and I shaved my butt hair and shaved my vagina so that my lips looked so natural. Then, I took a nice long bubble bath. After the bath, I put some lotion on my nipples and vagina, but then I was going to get ready for the day. I laid my clothes out on the bed. I looked sexy. I had a white tank top, and a pair of short shorts that actually looked respectable on me. I applied some of the lotion to my body and turned my body to the mirror, then walked through the door. It was just a little too dark for that kind of public place, so I chose a pair of bikini panties, also a little too short. I liked how they looked on me. Maybe it's the difference in the humidity, or the heat, as opposed to the sweat from the day before, but there's no way that people could have seen me. Besides, I had decided to wear my swim trunks, in an attempt to keep the coolness of the city and to keep them from getting soaked. I didn't bother to put any underwear on under the top.</p> <p>The next day, I stopped by my car and dropped by the grocery store, knowing that some people would be leaving soon to get their food, but I didn't realize it. In the store was already someone I knew. Mike, the man from a couple of years earlier. He was working here and we had lunch with him. We had a great time together. I really liked the man. I'd been with Mike a few years back, and we'd talked a lot. We decided to meet at a friend's house tomorrow afternoon.</p> <p>We ate lunch in the supermarket and we went home. Mike and I had a nice meal too. The conversation was all about work. I knew that Mike hated the fact that we were going to go to the park. I was excited about the trip. He was excited about the prospect.</p> <p>Mike turned out to be a really nice person, not just a guy, but a good listener and a really nice person too. We'd go camping together. We went to the park about a month after we met. The park was about a block away from where I knew Mike and his friends. We took a picnic lunch and sat down in the sun for lunch. We talked while we ate, and he told me all about his job and his dreams of becoming a writer, and we talked about that same. We talked about what he was doing as a writer, and our jobs. We talked a lot about the world around us. We talked about just getting out of town. It was nice. We didn't say much about our sex days, so there wasn't much to say. But we discussed it at length, and decided that the best thing for us was to keep it out of the house for a little while, and then decide whether to do anything about the two of us. We agreed to take it easy, if it would help us work through some of our mutual desires, and that was that.</p> <p>Mike's story of being a writer was interesting, but I was curious about some of his other stories. So we planned to write them out and see what happened. We finished lunch with our lunch, then we went into the park and we found a blanket on the ground. We stretched out on it, feeling the sun on our bare skin and the warm air on our naked bodies.</p> <p>"So do you like your stories?" he asked.</p> <p>"Sure," I replied, "They're great."</p> <p>Mike grinned. "You think we might just do that?"</p> <p>I laughed. "Not if I'm on the job. We can finish our job today, go on with our lives, and then we'll see what happens when we're finished." I wanted to hear more of that.</p> <p>And then I saw him, standing at the picnic table with a beer in his hand. He didn't look too happy. I smiled and took his hand.
