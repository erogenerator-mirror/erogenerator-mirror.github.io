When he was empty, he got up, wiped himself off, and walked back to the chair and made his way to the kitchen. He made himself a sandwich and took a shower and was still standing in front of the door when he knocked. He didn't hear any answer so he called out to his mom and told her the bathroom door just opened. "Hey mom, it's me."</p> <p>She opened up the door and said, "Hello to you too, honey. I hope you're having a good time. I thought it was only a matter of time at the office that we could spend some time alone."</p> <p>"Thanks," he said as he opened the door. "Well I do have a question, though."</p> <p>"What is it?"</p> <p>"You have to remember you're not going to be working for me. I'm just going to show my work in the office, if it's not too much trouble."</p> <p>She gave him a quizzical look for a moment and said, "Do I have to?"</p> <p>"Of course you do. Now do you have any trouble with this? It's been a while since I've been out of the country."</p> <p>"Not at all," she said as she got up and headed for the door. "Just hurry up, I don't want to see you getting in trouble with my dad."</p> <p>"We'll be in touch," he told her as he left the kitchen. As he went by he noticed the time and decided he needed to change his work. He decided to take a nice long hot shower before he tried to get back into her life. That done he took a nice long hot shower, too. After he got out he checked his email and remembered he had been waiting for over forty hours for an answer. He decided to leave it a while to see what time he was supposed to be working. It took him a couple of minutes to finish putting his work away and getting back into his car. He was finally sitting in the parking lot of his favorite motel thinking. All the answers for so long were forgotten with his current situation. He realized he was just getting started in a real shitty life. As he drove away he thought about how nice it looked to have something to do but it was so much better than this boring life he had to live. He wanted to change it all but he knew it was impossible. He was going to have to get away from work soon.</p> <p>"Oh God," he said to himself when he hit the highway. "What the hell is wrong with me? I was just fucking up my life for forty hours now and then I'm not going to be able to stop so soon!" He turned on to Highway 80 and was instantly turned off. He had had the same effect on his own life which he had on the other side of the country. He hated life now. It was a strange part of himself that was missing at the moment but he knew it wasn't really worth the trouble. He looked at his phone once more as he walked around to his car. It was five a.m. and he had fifteen minutes to get a motel room.</p> <p>Finally he saw an auto repair shop across the street and a gas station. The only one in town was actually just two miles away. He decided to stop the car and take a quick shower. He knew that if he went inside to pick up the car after he got done for him, there would be no going back. It wasn't bad enough for him to get laid in just twenty minutes but it would come around as a lot of work at the next job. He took his shower and was already in the store when he got back to him. As he walked up to the counter, he saw her name on the sign for the gas station.</p> <p>"Well I guess it's my turn to pick up my car," she said as she approached. She walked over to him, took his hand, and pulled him into the store.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah. I just came by and got my car," he said as he dropped his keys on the counter.</p> <p>"Where do you want it?" she said as she looked at the gas station and stopped in her tracks.</p> <p>"It's about a forty minute drive down from here," he told her. "Let me pay first."</p> <p>She was walking towards him when they reached the car when he turned and said, "I have to pick up my car."</p> <p>As they walked along and got in the car, they talked for a while. "Did you have a nice time?" he asked her.</p> <p>"Yeah," she replied. "We had a lot happening right there in the store. It really wasn't so bad is it?"</p> <p>"No, it was very nice actually," he respondedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
