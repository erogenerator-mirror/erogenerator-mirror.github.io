I'm an adult. Nothing but sex that shouldn't be enjoyed by a married woman!"</p> <p>Then he saw her look down and start to shake and convulse in his arms.</p> <p>He turned and looked back, "How long did you...oh god, it felt so good!"</p> <p>"The best?"</p> <p>"Yeah!"</p> <p>He kissed her and then they embraced and kissed again, then she was laughing and crying. As she leaned into him, she hugged him so tight her face actually smeared her mascara and her eyes were glazed.</p> <p>"Oh, fuck!" she whispered, "Oh, god, I've missed you!"</p> <p>"So have I, Baby. I just wish I'd gotten more experience like you."</p> <p>She kissed him again, but this time she didn't resist or pull away.</p> <p>She looked up at him in surprise, "But this is only a date!"</p> <p>"I'm not your boyfriend. I'm a new guy now. We can do everything together...and yes, I'm definitely going to have sex."</p> <p>She giggled "I'm definitely getting off on this. Can't believe I'm doing this now for my future husband."</p> <p>"Honey," he said, pulling her up to him, "Do you really think...I'm your future husband now?"</p> <p>"YES," she said, her face lighting up like she'd never gotten this far before.</p> <p>"Oh, my god. So do you? Do you think she'll agree?"</p> <p>"Definitely! We can always leave it at that. You know, she really loves to get that way when the mood hits her. And what does that have in mind, honey? Do you seriously think she'd like it? Hell, it's almost like...I don't know...it's like a dare...you know, get in charge and be in control the whole time?"</p> <p>"Yes she'll be okay. She loves it now. I'm all for that. She loves the idea."</p> <p>"I don't know, honey, just saying that. It's your idea...I know it sounds weird, but I just don't think it would be wise to give you a hard time about it, if you think it'll work."</p> <p>"Well, maybe I could be wrong," she said as she kissed him again; just as she'd done on their first night together.</p> <p>He kissed her again and squeezed her breasts gently and she sighed as his fingers slipped from her mouth to slide over her nipple. Then she pulled away "But now? Now? I still gotta get our food."</p> <p>"Yeah," he replied with a chuckle, "but I was serious. You know me better than that. Besides, what if it doesn't work out?"</p> <p>She smiled as she kissed him again and said, "We'll see, I promise!"</p> <p>Then, she giggled, "Okay, I love you."</p> <p>He turned to run to the bathroom and before he got out, reached over and caught a stray hair and then kissed her one more time. She looked at him and said, "Go wash up and don't drive home."</p> <p>"Honey, I'm sorry," he said, "I really want us to be together."</p> <p>She grabbed him and pulled him to his feet "Oh, honey. I'm so sorry."</p> <p>"It's okay," he said softly. "It's been...amazing. This is our second date, but the first has just been magical. And we can get back to being real friends when we get married."</p> <p>He looked down at the floor and then smiled, "I guess you're right, but I still feel a lot like I've seen you naked in the park. Wow!"</p> <p>"No, I mean it's okay. I meant what I said about the way you're holding me. I never stopped thinking about that."</p> <p>"I don't care about that," he said. "We'll go to the diner for brunch in 15 minutes and have a coffee and then we can see where we are going. We can take a shower and we can make the next round of dinner together."</p> <p>She was looking at him, waiting for him to say something. He looked at her, a bit hurt, but then said, "Okay, sure."</p> <p>She looked at him with her most serious expression. Then she smiled and pulled him down and kissed him again. Then she slipped back into her room and shut the door.</p> <p>They embraced and kissed again, and then she went back to her room. They lay there together as they lay there, kissed and caressed until they fell asleep in each other's arms. When he woke her, he was sure she had a smile on her face and said, "I think it's okayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
