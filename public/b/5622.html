"I'm tired. Are you sure you don't want to take a nap, too?"</p> <p>"I am," she said, reaching over and pulling me up, still cuddling me. "I'm sure, and it sounds good."</p> <p>"What do you think?" I asked softly.</p> <p>"No, silly. You're right. It's not a bad movie. Maybe a little rough."</p> <p>I leaned back and closed my eyes. She wasn't exactly a bad date either. She gave me something that made me dizzy. What the hell. My mind felt too confused to react. What the hell, I asked myself, where did I even begin this? A girl can do what a good girl can do. But that's one big chicken shit.</p> <p>"I feel bad about kissing you... in the car this time—" I started before we were interrupted by the sound of her voice. There was a soft voice that was as clear as crystal. "I'm sorry," she said. The voice came back, her tone and purpose clear.</p> <p>"I shouldn't have kissed you tonight."</p> <p>"Is that what happened in the car?" I responded, trying to ignore it.</p> <p>"You didn't like the kissing?"</p> <p>I couldn't help myself. "What?"</p> <p>"Oh, for the last time. I was kissing you," she said, looking at me and back to the screen. A warm glow seemed to emanate from her and from her touch.</p> <p>She leaned in close to me, putting some kind of pressure on my arm. "I hope you're not feeling all lonely," she said. A blush bloomed on my cheeks. That look, that sexy smile, that beautiful throat, those eyes that were like glowing gold—I knew it had to be her. She was a goddess. And her name was Mary.</p> <p>So I was.</p> <p>Our lips slowly melted together, her lips sliding up and down the length of my neck. I couldn't stop smiling. When the feeling passed, my smile vanished. It was gone. I closed my eyes, letting the moment wash over me.</p> <p>"Shit," I said.</p> <p>Mary's lips left mine, and she turned away from me. I felt her body press against mine, pressing me against the sofa. I turned around to face her. She put her hands on the armchair next to my shoulder and leaned into me. She was pressed up against me. Her lips were just a fraction shorter than mine; we kissed, the softest, sweetest kiss that I'd ever gotten from either of us.</p> <p>This was love, pure and simple.</p> <p>We were connected by our lips. This is no bad romance, this is a loving, affectionate, and tender act of friendship that we were sharing between us in the warmth of the moment. But as a lover, and as a woman, I can feel more emotion than that, more passion than that. And if it really is love, and a kiss as loving and a kiss as tender as that, it is still a friendship that is not meant to be a boyfriend relationship. It can be so wrong that it can be so right, so necessary to have in that relationship.</p> <p>"Mary?" I whispered. "What are you doing?"</p> <p>"I just want you to be more and more sure about kissing tonight," she said. "I want you to be sure that you don't go any further than what you've already done, and that you're ready. I know," she said. "And, as I said, I would."</p> <p>"Ok," I said, feeling my pulse quicken.</p> <p>"Wait," she said. "Just tell me when we're ready. Everything is ready."</p> <p>I thought for a moment about answering, but couldn't. What if she was just kidding? What if this is her real name?</p> <p>"Ok," I said.</p> <p>"Shit," she said. "We better get going. But I am so ready. I've been aching all day."</p> <p>"But not from kissing?"</p> <p>"No," Mary replied. "It's all right."</p> <p>She slipped out of the chair and gave me her arm like a gentleman would, but I could tell that she was a different type of gentleman than I. We embraced again and she led me to her bedroom. Her bedroom is right next to mine. I wasn't exactly sure where she intended, but I knew she liked to put things off for a while.</p> <p>"Wait here," she told me. She was just out of the robe now.
