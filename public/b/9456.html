The coast was clear, and she turned back to her new friend, "I'm not sure that's what she wanted."</p> <p>"What?" asked James, unsure how much she had actually asked.</p> <p>"I need some...uh, you know. A hand job."</p> <p>He smiled nervously and sat down next to her, his hands clasped behind his thighs.</p> <p>Shocked at the sudden change in her demeanor, she laughed nervously, and then looked up at him as she licked her lips. He could barely say anything, not quite ready to look her in the eye, and he couldn't take his eyes off of her. She took his hand and wrapped it around her, then pulled him to her.</p> <p>"Hands down again," she told him, and slid further into the couch. James followed along, his face flushing a little as he felt his jeans tighten against his erection.</p> <p>Shyly, he pulled his hands back, letting his fingers glide up her arms, and caressed her back as he kissed the back of her neck.</p> <p>"Like this?" He murmured, and she shivered as his fingers slipped into the thin bra strap and down her shoulder to trace around the edge of her breast.</p> <p>"Yeah, like that," she said, and leaned back into the couch. He kissed the back of her shoulder, and she rubbed her thighs against his erection through his jeans.</p> <p>"You're driving me crazy," he said, his voice barely audible. "I know I've had the best hand job ever," he said, still holding her arm. She nodded, leaning into him.</p> <p>She didn't bother to pull her shirt up. His hands slowly went up to cup her breasts. She held his face in her hands and kissed him.</p> <p>"I think your hand's making a mess," she said, and let slip an evil grin. "What's up with you?"</p> <p>James turned around to face her, his mouth hungrily meeting her, and her hand started to slip from his crotch. His cock bounced up, against him.</p> <p>"Sorry," she told him, grinning. She let go of his face, and reached up to slide his jeans down his thighs. With a shake of his hips, he took the hint, and she was free. Before he could think about stopping her or anything, she dropped to her knees and began to massage his cock through his underwear. As her tongue began to tease it out, she let out a long sigh, "Mmmmmm," she purred.</p> <p>She wrapped her hand around the length of him, and continued to caress his cock with her tongue and lips. He gasped each time her lips moved down to caress the ridge that protruded just below his sack. She'd wrapped her hands around him, and had started to tug gently along the length of his shaft—just enough to get him going.</p> <p>"Your cock tastes so good," she cooed in his ear. His hands slid over to her hair, and she pulled back and pushed her mouth down further onto him. He groaned and looked down at his girlfriend. She wasn't as thin as he'd imagined, but was toned and lean, as though she'd just come out of the gym. His eyes moved to the front of her shirt, where her breasts had begun to harden. "See, you're going to have to do something to get me into your bedroom or something," he told her, grinning.</p> <p>"Whatever you feel like doing tonight," she told him, her hair trailing down her neck. Her breathing was growing heavier, making him realize that the thought of him and the new woman in his life wasn't very likely to pass quickly—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
