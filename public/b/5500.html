"I never believed in him becoming an international celebrity. I thought we had a natural connection. He's only been there three months!"</p> <p>"I still miss him when he leaves," I said. She laughed, which filled me with relief and then asked, "Can I ask you a couple of questions first?"</p> <p>We both paused to look around. One of the first things we saw were our dormitory rooms. Our room on the top floor had a separate entrance way through another door and a connecting door opposite the first door on the left, the one closest to the third door on the right.</p> <p>I walked inside and closed the door behind me. After a short while I came back out and grabbed a small bag. I pulled out the two bags, and then I turned around. We were surrounded by a long line. A single female sitting in a row of seats had her eyes closed and was holding her stomach with one hand. She was moaning and I started to ask her the question that had popped my mind.</p> <p>"Is he here?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes!" she replied. "He's here now. He left me a message!"</p> <p>I couldn't tell anything to the guy on one side, and the woman in the other. As I waited for my answer I tried to think of a way to ask her if everything was okay. The only thing I really did was let her know, but what do they have to say? All I can say is, 'oh my god! He's on the edge! I hope everything is alright!'</p> <p>I decided to sit down and start the search for the person I'm supposed to find first. As I sat back down her phone began to vibrate on her desk. I felt a surge of adrenaline and excitement course through me every time I picked up the phone. I listened to it and then, "I'm back."</p> <p>I heard her say softly, "I feel a bit strange. I've been on my back for most of the day and I feel a little empty."</p> <p>I heard her whisper back to me, "I'm here," and the vibrating of her phone had gone down. She began to rub herself through her slacks while she said, "I wish I could feel this way when he finishes. I wish I could take my dress off right now!"</p> <p>"If he does finish, take off the slacks and I'll take care of you."</p> <p>"I like you," she said quietly. I was intrigued and excited at the same time. I couldn't think of anything else. I sat back down on the bed and turned my chair away from her desk so I could examine her room. I quickly finished my breakfast and went back to my dormitory.</p> <p>That night I received a note from an email. It read simply, "I wish I had thought of this years ago! I hope you didn't think this was an emergency and that we could be friends again, although not yet."</p> <p>Before long she sent me a series of emails describing all that had happened. She described how she had been stripped bare again and how turned on she got at the thought of all that had happened. It was easy to talk about what had happened and she knew how that came out.</p> <p>I was glad to have someone who understood what I was feeling about what we had done years ago, and who hadn't given in to the urge to masturbate. She showed me more than just that, because she let me read another story that she had written. That chapter was "Doing her best" and her reaction to it told me that she would have liked for me to be her first man. I was relieved to hear that it wasn't something that she was really looking for, but I still wondered how she could find a reason to have sex again.</p> <p>We talked online and when time came for me to meet her again we exchanged pictures and stories, but nothing much had happened. Finally she asked, "Do you still want to be friends with me?"</p> <p>"Of course!" I replied. I was ready to give her another surprise birthday present, but we needed more time. "Okay!" I said, "I'll find a time when I can talk to you againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
