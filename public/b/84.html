"Mommy says I'm going to be a good girl."</p> <p>She stood for a minute with her arms loosely, waiting for the kiss to finish. She watched him smile up at her with those big blue eyes and knew she'd enjoy herself as much as she would have any other time.</p> <p>As she kissed his neck, he leaned forward and they hugged each other deeply, their breasts pressing together through their thin dresses. They stayed like that until she knew her daughter was ready to go and she lifted her chin and made sure he kissed her.</p> <p>"I've got to get out of here first, Daddy," she said. "Let's go inside and get some dinner."</p> <p>"Can you wait just a few minutes," Daddy asked. "I'm starving."</p> <p>"Sure," she smiled and held his head in her hands as she leaned against him, looking down at his face. "But I think you're quite hungry," she said.</p> <p>"I'm starving," he smiled and pulled her against him, kissing her tenderly again.</p> <p>"I'd better go," she said, her hand reaching for his zipper. "I want to have some things prepared before we go out, okay?"</p> <p>He pulled away from her and helped her out of the room. She followed him into a kitchen, where he took a knife and cut up the dinner prep, adding a couple of extra pieces of butter and a couple of little herbs that he'd picked up from the kitchen.</p> <p>When he was satisfied, he handed her a fork, sandwich and two large glasses. He pulled out a nice big platter, which she used to split the food into two pieces. Dessert was served in the main course as well.</p> <p>"You're such a good daughter," he said. "And now, that dinner is ready, I think that should be just fine."</p> <p>She smiled up at him and nodded her head as she picked up two large plates, carrying them over to the table as he placed himself down beside her.</p> <p>"I love you, Daddy," she said as he took a quick taste of the food. "And you eat so much."</p> <p>"I know," he laughed. "I've done this a few times with your mother, too."</p> <p>"Okay," she smiled at him and took a sip of wine. "I love you, too. Are you really going to keep you old man in the desert forever, do you know?"</p> <p>He laughed again and nodded his head. "I've gotta run," he said. "And don't thank me for the wine, because I'm starting to feel like it's pouring out of me!"</p> <p>The three of them laughed a couple of times, just to make sure it worked out.</p> <p>"I think it might be time to call it quits," he announced.</p> <p>"Okay," she returned. "I guess I can forgive you that, but it's all in fun, right?"</p> <p>He nodded his head. "You're right," he laughed. And then they both laughed at his comment.</p> <p>Chapter 6</p> <p>"It's nice to have you home again," Dad said.</p> <p>"I guess I'd like that," she agreed. "I like it."</p> <p>"It's nice to have you home again, too," he said, leaning over and kissing her cheek. "But, I think we'll get in the way, don't you?"</p> <p>"I know," she said, smiling and then gave him a warm hug.</p> <p>They both laughed as she stepped out a while later. Dad was gone for a while on business, but he still had a hard time sleeping. He loved being able to come home in the morning while he made love to his daughter.</p> <p>"What time is it," he told her as he put on his pants and buttoned up his shirt.</p> <p>"It's about half one," she said. "Why you are, maybe, going to be late getting up!"</p> <p>She leaned over and kissed him again, just a few moments before the front door closed. She walked quickly to her room, then called out to her father from the kitchen.</p> <p>"What do you think you're doing, Daddy?" she asked as he opened the door.</p> <p>"I want to talk to you, Sweetheart," he teased. "Can I come with you this morning?"</p> <p>"Sure," she answered. "I'll probably be up for a while."</p> <p>"Okay," he said. "But I'm not sure I should go back to sleep. I think I've got a lot of thinking to do."</p> <p>"Doing?"</p> <p>"Yes," he smiled and kissed her hand. "You've just been with her for two hours."</p> <p>A littleâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
