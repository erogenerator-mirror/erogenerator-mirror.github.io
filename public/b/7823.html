I started by saying, "You were very good with that thing," when we were done.</p> <p>We came up beside our old high school friends, Jenny and Mark. I don't know if they knew we were going to do this, or whether they were aware. All of them were in awe of the performance we just took. I gave Jenny a little kiss to the cheek and Mark a quick one, but in his excitement Mark didn't feel it and instead leaned in for another kiss. As we moved in for it a minute later I looked down and realized that I was a little wet for just a moment.</p> <p>We separated, and I gave Jenny one last look up at the stars before I stood and took my jacket off.</p> <p>"I think your nipples would look pretty good peeking out from that T-shirt, sweetie!"</p> <p>Jenny gave my nipples a quick, teasing squeeze before adding, "Hurry back, you aren't going to get much sleep for awhile, and don't forget to pick the CD."</p> <p>"Sure, but first, you have to get back up to speed." I replied as I gave Mark's nipples a good squeeze before starting to dance.</p> <p>I was very excited as I made my way back up the stairs to the main room. I don't think I even noticed my hand slip down my side to touch one of Mark's breasts. I took Mark's hand, and asked her what she thought.</p> <p>"I don't know about the next part, but after seeing us play around and doing our best to stay hidden that is about time." She replied.</p> <p>We were in another room after an hour of the most intense sex ever. I felt the sexual tension beginning to build. There was a definite lack of the usual kissing, touching, and fondling on the way back upstairs. There were no lights in the room, but that did not mean that no one was in the rest of the house.</p> <p>I made my way to my room and found Jenny and Mark in the master bedroom, where the CD was, waiting for me. It looked like any other CD I had on. There was a CD titled, "The Way You Are." It sounded like it really suited all three of us as far as we were concerned.</p> <p>"What did you like? How much did you pay for it?" Mark asked.</p> <p>Jenny laughed, "I was sure that we would have to pay a lot more. We got some for free, if you would prefer that I didn't. It was not a big deal at all, just us getting it, but it was a bargain so far."</p> <p>"We are going to give you the full treatment this weekend. We will be back again as soon as we get settled in. There is a big bed just inside the door, I think it would be nice to lay beside you tonight, just the two of us, but we'll have to be careful and leave the curtains open this Saturday too." Jenny said.</p> <p>I knew that Jenny was going to get all of the details later on, so I just nodded my head and left it to her. The video tape was a total mess. One thing I did realize was watching it was turning me on. I really didn't know what to do, and I was in a different room getting turned on by watching her make love to another man.</p> <p>Saturday morning rolled around. While we were in bed, I found my hand under the covers caressing my little sex. I stopped as I noticed the slight change in body heat. Jenny didn't seem to notice my touch, but Mark must have been. After a few minutes I got up, got in, and turned back the covers. I slipped a finger into my pussy for a couple of minutes and was pleasantly surprised by the warmth. I thought about getting a finger on myself, but instead I turned the lights down a little and just thought of Mark.</p> <p>After our shower we got naked and put our towels down for the bathroom. We dried each other off, before we started our sex routine. I turned on the light and went to a drawer where we kept our condoms, telling Jenny to get one. I got under the sheets with her and kissed her. We hugged for a few minutes.</p> <p>"Are you sure you really want to do this?" Jenny asked.</p> <p>"I'm a little excited to see where things are going. If, you are a little excited in real life, you know, how we end up in bed, and how you really feel about how it is going to start, I don't know what it is that you need to know." I told her.</p> <p>She gave me a shy smile, "Are you going to do itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
