I will come back for my coffee, I'm sure that will be all right."</p> <p>"You can stay longer if you like, after I'm done there."</p> <p>That brought a knowing smile to my lips. I walked toward the door, then turned back around. "I'll see you in two weeks," I said. "Bye."</p> <p>After I made a half-hearted push through the door, I walked out of the bar. The thought of having a weekend with my girlfriend, and the feeling that the thought of my weekend off was a once in a lifetime experience, made me heartily glad that the first time I met her was only the beginning. I walked down the street to my apartment block, feeling my cheeks flush and my pussy throb. I decided to take a shower while I waited for Kara. I had plenty of time, after all.</p> <p>I quickly showered, dried myself off and got dressed. I had a short time to get the place cleaned up and then I had just about enough time to get dinner out of the way. I had ordered room service and we had some Italian food to go with it.

I walked her to the door, and we went our separate ways without saying a word. When we got to our room, we both undressed and climbed into bed. Within a short time, Karen had her head buried in my pussy, and both were writhing on the bed, screaming in orgasm at the top of their lungs. When they lay panting, they finally looked up at me and told me that they were done for the night. I had never felt happier in all my life, even with the feeling that they could have been lovers forever.</p> <p>The next week was a blur of coming and going. I just missed her so much.
