I could use the company on a day off... and you know what to do.'</p> <p>I went around the bar where we had agreed, and made my way back upstairs.</p> <p>'No, don't forget... she got me so worked up I need to blow,' He said quietly.</p> <p>I looked away, embarrassed, but continued.</p> <p>'No. she helped me on. She's very good at sex. She's got the ability to make me cum hard and fast... '</p> <p>I looked at him and felt my whole body tingling, with nervous excitement.</p> <p>'Oh, I'm going to like the company, yes,' I nodded, suddenly feeling self conscious about doing it in those heels.</p> <p>'So, now what?' I said.</p> <p>'Let's get this done, and I'm yours to help you solve your problem.'</p> <p>'I'm not sure,' I said, trying to look around the room, only to get a sudden slap across the face, and my cheeks burning as I turned back to look him in the face.</p> <p>'Don't you dare speak or talk to me,' he said quietly.</p> <p>'I want to... to do it...' I started hesitantly, then added.</p> <p>'Just please don't say anything, we don't have anything to discuss...'</p> <p>His eyes took in everything I said, and my face flushed with shame. He smiled, amused... He was not the kind of guy who just laughed at everything.</p> <p>'I need a favour,' I said quietly, as I turned from him.</p> <p>I heard the sound of a zip being undone, as he turned his back to me, and turned around, slowly exposing his cock, which was standing straight and tall.</p> <p>'I'm going to sit on the floor and I just thought about asking you... But, you know, I can't do it on...'</p> <p>His face was starting to cloud and he stopped.</p> <p>'I'm sorry, it's really nothing I've done. It was just a job. I'm doing this out of a sense of duty for you...'</p> <p>He took a step towards me, his voice was barely audible, but I could hear him.</p> <p>'Of course, I know who I need to call up, and I don't have a name,' he said quietly, his voice was almost quivering with emotion.</p> <p>I felt suddenly guilty.</p> <p>'It was an accident, I was drunk....'</p> <p>'I'm sorry,' he whispered, quietly.</p> <p>'It's all right,' I said.</p> <p>I didn't speak again, as I sat on the floor, trying to regain my dignity. I felt so humiliated. My face was covered in tears now.</p> <p>'I'm sorry, I have to say that. But please, don't go on...'</p> <p>'I didn't ask for a favour,' I managed to mumble.</p> <p>His hand touched mine, and we stared into each other's eyes.</p> <p>'It was an interesting experience,' he said, softly.</p> <p>'Do you know why I'm here?' I replied quietly, still not knowing what to say or do.</p> <p>'For a reason, I guess,' he replied.</p> <p>'What sort of reason? Please don't think you have to go through life just to get yourself off,' I said, trying for the first time.</p> <p>Then he leaned into me, he put his arms around me and buried his face in my neck. My breasts touched his chest, and he pulled me close to him as he kissed me. I could smell the scent of my perfume on his face. I felt his heart beating against us, and his arms around my waist, I melted away into his embrace, completely.</p> <p>We kissed, hard and passionately. I could taste my own sweet juices, as our tongues swirled together. He moved his hands from holding me around the waist, up to my breast and squeezed my aching nipple with his fingers. I could almost feel every one of his strong fingers caressing the breast I was crushing around his body. I reached behind his head and caressed his brown hair.</p> <p>My whole body was tingly, with heat. He moved his head as far to the left as it would go, and kissed me again. His kisses seemed so tender, and I felt so good, inside. He moved his face down so that his chin was under my chin and held me close. His arms tightened around me, and his tongue flicked against mine. My whole body was tingling at his touch.</p> <p>I felt so hotâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
