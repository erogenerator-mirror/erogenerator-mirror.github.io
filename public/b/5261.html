We made love, slowly and easily, and our bodies soon made noises of harmony, I felt as we climaxed together.</p> <p>It was an experience of long lasting love, and one that was almost beyond me. We both got an hour of sleep, that's when she finally fell asleep in my arms, and we woke to find we had our legs entangled. It took a minute for it to register that the day had finally arrived.</p> <p>"Thank god that was quick, I've never cum that quick in my whole life."</p> <p>"Oh, so you aren't a virgin then,"</p> <p>"No but I'm sure there's more to come than that."</p> <p>"As you wish,"</p> <p>"But first take a shower and I'll make some breakfast."</p> <p>She smiled and we agreed to breakfast the morning after our first kiss. The time came to tell her how we had met and the events that had led us to make love was wonderful. She took care of me and taught me and taught me the joys of being with a woman, of being her lover, and she introduced me to other woman's bodies too. She was not a "slut" as she would usually be but she had a certain look about her. She was very sweet and understanding, with a passion that was very good for a woman and it was easy to see that in her. We had talked a bit about our feelings about it, we both knew what we wanted, but she had always tried to make our fantasies come true without coming out on top, and now it was about to be the real thing. And I really knew that I wanted to make the most of it.</p> <p>We got into the shower and soaped each other up with the water flowing down our bodies and the soap, soaping my body she started on me, with her fingers she gently rubbed my cock until she got it very well stiff. She washed me with her mouth and I enjoyed it for myself and later I got some towels and got her some lacy panties that I like to sleep in. We went into the bedroom and soaped each other up before she did me. We were all eager for each other now and we went to our knees to kiss and make love to each other. It was wonderful. We both enjoyed each other so much, that we were ready to take it on and soon. Soon we were both out of our shoes, naked and our legs touching as we held each other.</p> <p>"It wasn't until you came that I knew I would be giving this very special gift to me, a man who can love me so very, very well."</p> <p>"What does that mean, what does she call you?"</p> <p>She smiled and I looked at her, she said, "If it means anything it means that I may not feel I am alone. I love to have a kiss, to be kissed while having just had sex."</p> <p>So we kissed, slowly for an hour or more, and I was ready to go again. We both had to work long hours, so we made love at least twice that night. It was as if we never stopped doing it, but she taught me much that I needed.</p> <p>We were together for a very long time, before she rolled over with her head to the top of the bed and she spread her legs with her feet on my shoulder, she looked very comfortable without even a skirt on for long. I moved over to her and her legs were very sexy and lovely to hold so I did. I lowered my cock and slowly moved it into her. As I did she put her legs down and took me in to the hilt. Her pussy was very exciting and nice to hold and I did what I could to enjoy her. She looked so wonderful that day, with soft hair and perfect skin, a beautiful woman. I looked at her beautiful face and was amazed at how she was different and beautiful to me, with her eyes and her beautiful face in all its beauty.</p> <p>But I remembered what I had seen on that day, and how she looked in the mirror as she lay still as was me. And I think I was surprised that she did it, but I was also very happy that it did. Now I started thrusting into her, just right, so she could feel how nice of me was beingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
