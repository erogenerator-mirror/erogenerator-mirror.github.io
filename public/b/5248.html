"Don't stop."</p> <p>"I can't," I said. "I'm cumming too soon."</p> <p>"Let it go, Tommy." She whispered back.</p> <p>I had her tits out but she didn't care. She lifted them up with out moving the fabric out of the way. They were so small that they were pushing against her belly. The movement of her tits pulled her nipples out into a shape. I moved off of her and we moved back to her. I leaned up and I started kissing her again. We kissed long and deep. It was like we were in a trance.</p> <p>We lay together and she slid down, straddling me. She spread her legs on either side of me and she started rubbing her crotch. Her hand moved in a slow circle.</p> <p>Finally, we went back to our previous positions. I lifted her off of me and she climbed on top of me. I had a chance to kiss her again when she straddled my face. It felt so good to me. Then, when she leaned down I kissed her breasts. My cock was pressing into her ass as I held her and started licking her nipples.</p> <p>She looked down. "You like that?" she asked as she lowered her pussy onto my cock.</p> <p>"You're so nice." I whispered back to her and we continued to kiss. I pushed my tongue down into her mouth and explored it. She was so nice. I pushed my tongue deeper to match with hers. I opened my mouth a little wider and I stuck it in. Our lips and tongues pressed together as I held her butt and fucked her. We were both moaning and she was making soft little sounds like she was about to cum. I was feeling so good that I didn't even care. I didn't care that she seemed to be on about.</p> <p>"I can't hold off much longer." she said as she began moving up and down. My cock felt so hard and so hard and so hard that I felt like I was ready to cum. "I'm cumming!" she cried. "I'm coming."</p> <p>"Do you feel it?" I whispered back to her. "Do you feel my hot cum shooting into you?"</p> <p>"Yes." she panted as she came.</p> <p>"Do you feel my cum?" she asked, her voice barely a whisper as I was holding her. It was my turn to hold her ass. My cock seemed to go back to full when she came again. It was so intense that we both came at the same time. We lay there a minute.</p> <p>"I like this." I whispered to her.</p> <p>We were going back to bed when we heard the phone ring.</p> <p>"Is he here?"</p> <p>"No." she replied. "He left at some point."</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Positive." She said. "He's with me now."</p> <p>"Good. Go get that thing out and put it away."</p> <p>"Ok."</p> <p>She didn't answer immediately. She didn't even say anything that was an order. The ringtone sounded off on the other end of the phone.</p> <p>"How long have you been standing there?" I said to her as I hung up the phone.</p> <p>"I have been standing where I am." she replied. "It may sound weird to you but my clothes are in the wash when I get up and they aren't in the living room. I hope they are ok. The door is unlocked. I hope it happens."</p> <p>"Ok, where is he?"</p> <p>"In the living room. I heard him running back to the truck. I was looking for him when he left the house."</p> <p>"Let me get the door." I said as I turned and headed toward my room. She was right. The door was unlocked as well. All I had to do was open it a couple of inch and I would be inside my room and the door would be open.</p> <p>The room was neat and tidy. It looked so like a living room. The sofa and chair were the same. I was sitting on the loveseat and I had the couch turned so it faced the sofa. I leaned back against the cushions and closed my eyes. I closed my eyes imagining it was Tommy's hands doing this to me. I put my hands in my lap and I was stroking up and down my cock. My mind was in a haze. Just as I was getting really worked on, I felt her tongue licking a finger tip. Her tongue was wet. I opened my eyes and watched her as she took the finger in her mouth. She moved it to and fro. I saw her tongue slide out and she lick something and then took that fingerâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
