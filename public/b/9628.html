I said, as though she was more beautiful than the first time I saw her with a glass of champagne.</p> <p>She nodded as though she knew what I was going to say next. She said, 'Darling, I didn't mean it like that. I just meant that, it's been... forever since we...."</p> <p>'When we just met,' I insisted, 'and I mean it, all of it.'</p> <p>'I mean that I'm the love of your life, my child. That and me alone, I can do whatever I need to do to keep your memory safe until after time is out.' She said, again, and then smiled as if she knew what I was going to say.</p> <p>'It's a small, small thing, but I'm sure it's worth all the pain and embarrassment that my own marriage has had to go through. I hope that we can be happy together - if we will truly be.'</p> <p>'There is no greater love than that which I feel.' She said softly, almost reverently. Her voice had the feel of someone in complete agreement. She meant it, and there was no doubt that we would be happy together.</p> <p>'You've been so kind to me.' I said. 'Never, and I mean never have I been so grateful to anyone.' I added.</p> <p>'I love you too my dear.' She said. 'You know that.'</p> <p>I held her a little tighter and said, 'I do, and I would just like to tell you that for sure.' I whispered into her ear.</p> <p>There was a silence and then she whispered, 'Forgive me?'</p> <p>'Not if you mean it, for sure, but you can't imagine the number of times I've regretted it.' I whispered back, and then I kissed her. She hugged me tight as I held her and her body started to respond to me.</p> <p>'I think I've really found my soulmate, darling. I mean it....I mean, I'm not looking for a permanent relationship with anyone, especially with anyone as old as you. No one will ever know unless I tell them.'</p> <p>'But you are still my wife. But I don't see the need on our own either. You do understand that your wife has already been dead for a while, and will be once more, I promise.' I said, with a cheeky grin.</p> <p>'Thank you for that.' She laughed. 'But now I understand. You know how very important this is, don't you?'</p> <p>'You're as much of a husband as anyone I know.' I said. 'Not even as good as you are."</p> <p>'No there's nothing better for you to know, darling, I'm not in mourning yet.' She replied. 'Although my body still craves for someone as beautiful as you.' She pouted, and then sighed.</p> <p>'What about you?' I asked seriously.</p> <p>'Yes, of course. Not the same person as I thought it would be for you. You still have your job, and your job is very important. Now I can't really think of anything to say, it's a bit personal, but I really do need to say something to you.' She said, her voice quivering as though her voice were a thousand tiny drops of water falling over a rock.</p> <p>'That the worst of all, is to come at me with your body all wet and slippery. I'll have a fit, won't I? The only thing I care about is your body.' I explained. 'Now, I'm going to tell you something that I had to say, but then I know we're both going to need to know what it must be after all.' I said, kissing her again.</p> <p>She was silent a second or two and then whispered, 'Would you rather I told anyone?' She didn't wait for me to answer, nor did I ask why.</p> <p>'What do you mean?'</p> <p>'I told you what to say.' She replied breathlessly. 'I don't see any need to keep secrets from the best of times.'</p> <p>'And my life's not going to be the same without you, does it?'</p> <p>'I don't know, Darling. I really don't, you know.' She said.</p> <p>'Do you think I might understand?' 'Yes.' She whispered. 'It makes no difference to me, if you think it does. This is the first time for me in a long time that I think that I'm going to get to talk to anyone.' She said with a frown.</p> <p>'I'll know when you decide.' I said.</p> <p>I pulled back and looked at her, looking directly into her eyes.
