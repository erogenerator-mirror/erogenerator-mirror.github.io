It could be the weekend. If you wanted to get caught we could get a ticket. We're having supper on Saturday. What do you want to do? We've got a big game next Saturday, and the games are a team thing."</p> <p>"It's a lot less hassle and costs so I can get out of a little before the crowds get even bigger, don't you think?"</p> <p>"Sounds good to me."</p> <p>We made a quick call to my Mom's cell phone to tell her I was on my way, and she asked me where I would be if I got there. The last thing I wanted to do was get a ticket for an old pickup they had parked on the front of our lot that had broken down on it's return. My Mom answered the phone as I pulled away from the curb, "Oh, it's me, John, calling about my little errand."</p> <p>An hour later I pulled up and parked and hopped out of the van. It was almost 1:00PM in the afternoon and the game was going to be just two half innings, no game. But the fans were going to be there. It was going to be interesting.</p> <p>I got to school about an hour or so before the start, so I had to run home to pick-up. I walked into the stadium a half hour before the start and was surprised to see that everyone except a few players were coming out to get beers and whatever else to cover the time- difference. I took my usual seat in an empty seat at the back of the bleachers. People were trying to make plans for me on my scholarship, so I could get to my school around 6:30PM. I didn't bother with telling them my real name. I didn't bother to tell them I was eighteen and had finished my year at college.</p> <p>Once again I sat quietly while the crowd, mostly younger people, was made up of three women of all ages and in all sorts of undress. This time, a bunch of the boys were cheering me as I played on the field. I felt pretty good as the game went on. The game had lasted until 5:00, but I still enjoyed the excitement of the team's first two innings of the season and the anticipation as the fans lined up to start.</p> <p>At the third inning the crowd went to two and the start started. It hadn't even been a minute, and in fact there was only half-inning in the first two innings. Finally, the fans lined up again, and I began to feel a little bad when they all lined up by myself and each of the guys in the stands. As the half-inning starts of the second inning started I realized all I had done was walk-in. The whole bunch of them had been waiting for the ball. I was being watched.</p> <p>It was a lot tougher this time than the first time, but I thought it was going to get better than last time. I had played my role well, and I had to work hard to get the ball from the pitcher's line up. For the inning, I played well and I got the ball and hit a solid home run. My teammates and I cheered for me, and we celebrated the victory by getting the ball back.</p> <p>At one point a few of them gave me a thumbs up and a thumbs-up in my ear. A few of the coaches and the players came up and kissed me. One of them said, "We're all glad your coach was willing to play with you after all these years." Another said, "Hey, I'm sorry our guys have been waiting for you to play with them after they've been coached by you." The next said, "Hey, I told you he's not my boy." The next three guys kissed me and I thought they were going to kiss each other. I didn't have time to wonder about it, but I did wonder if they could get a little adventurous.</p> <p>After the first half-inning game we had a couple of beers and caught up on the team. The first inning was pretty good. I was able to get the ball in easily and the second game was a little more successful. I was a nervous wreck with the entire third inning and the first nine innings. It looked like there was going to be trouble. I got another pitcher in, and the crowd again began to cheer. Finally, after the first one-on-one homerun, and three more innings the game was over.</p> <p>I noticed that most of the guys had changed jerseys and were wearing their jackets. All the players were walking around in their own uniforms, and seemed to be talking away. It didn't go unnoticed at all by the crowd who were giving me the thumbs-up. My face must have shown disappointment.</p> <p>The rest of the first half's was very interesting.
