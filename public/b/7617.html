I'm a girl, okay?"</p> <p>She could hear the grin in his voice. She smiled back, and moved a little closer. He moved her hands to her own breasts, and lifted them up again, letting them fall back down.</p> <p>"I told you to wear something a little more revealing than that... and now, here comes the challenge...". His hands pulled her up slightly so he could slide his tongue along her thigh. "Like I said," he continued, "now you're really going to get a lot of show!"</p> <p>He pushed her back a little harder, pulling her into him as he kissed her again. He moved down a little but pulled her panties off herself!</p> <p>"Now I'm going to have fun, too!" he said, and he pulled his head away before she could complain any further. She heard him stand up again, a little impatient. She wondered what he'd be making out with this time. After all, she had been doing a lot of imagining herself doing this for years and she was now going to be in for a good seeing-to.</p> <p>She watched him pull his pants down. He hadn't really brought anything out for her yet, but she could already tell he was big. His dick was long and thick, and a bit shorter than average. The head was big enough to stay still, and it wasn't going to be that great of a surprise to see that the head had an angry purple shape right where he wanted it. He reached up with his right hand, and rubbed the precum on his fingers through the material, up its ridge some more. His right thumb was already working it's way back down her pussy, and he pushed a finger inside before sliding it underneath.</p> <p>"Oh, God..." He said softly. "I'm glad you're ready. I'm going to enjoy this better with you." He said it with a smile, and her excitement doubled, and she pressed her hips forward on his hand. He quickly felt the wetness as she gripped his fingers.</p> <p>"There," he said, "that's a little better." He reached up and wrapped his hand around her shoulder, but he didn't slide his finger out. Instead, he held it in place, looking down at her. "I think you know what's coming, right?"</p> <p>She could hear his voice, but he was so clearly excited. Her mouth was dry and she could feel her heart racing. She nodded her head, and waited...</p> <p>He kissed her again on the lips, but this time he wasn't just kissing her mouth. He started running his tongue around it some more, and she tasted herself. He slid his hand down and started rubbing her clit with his thumb, and she felt herself start to tremble even more. He slipped two fingers inside her, making her feel full. He pushed them all the way in, then took over the whole hand, and started rubbing her g-spot, making her arch her hip into him.</p> <p>She couldn't help but cry out. She didn't know she could. It was way too quiet, and her whole body couldn't hear her in this position. But somehow, even though he used his other hand to rub her clit more, it felt good, too, if it were possible. She was going crazy, she was really ready. It was a slow, teasing, wet, and she was going out of her mind. She never imagined she was in that position before, but it felt fantastic. He stopped suddenly, and she started to protest again.</p> <p>"Are you OK?" he asked quietly after a few seconds, and she almost fell to the floor on herself. He was so good at this. She didn't know she could enjoy this, but she knew she couldn't. She started to whimper in frustration when she felt something else instead. She couldn't say anything about it, or even think about it.</p> <p>He took his hand away first. She felt a little relief. He looked at her again, his face still red and sweaty. Her heart was hammering.</p> <p>"I want to taste you..." he said. "Are you sure you're willing?" The way he asked her that just made her feel... she didn't want to think too much about it. She nodded with a small smile. He grabbed his dick and placed it between her legs, making her moan.</p> <p>"You'll need something to lubricate, if you want to do all this..." He said.</p> <p>"Oh...ok..." she replied, a little overwhelmed by what she did next. It came out a little maudingly, but she didn't care. She wanted this, and she didn't know where this was going.</p> <p>"I'm going to justâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
