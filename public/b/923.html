The contrast in flavor sent my cock into overdrive, sending me to the brink just as soon as I was aware of her.</p> <p>I lifted my head up and looked up towards her eyes to see her watching me with a look of wonder. "So, you liked sucking on him the other day... I'm impressed." She said as one hand moved to gently play with my balls.</p> <p>"Mmmm... he can suck a dick," she whispered into my ear as my tongue lapped and swirled around hers as I continued working on her wet cunt. I continued thrusting as I looked back up at our eyes and could see her pussy twitch a little as if she was about to cum... Her whole body was shaking underneath, her nipples hard and firm now and her body shivering with pleasure.</p> <p>I looked at her and smiled. "Are you going to cum for me, too?" I asked and she nodded in response. I leaned forward and moved my tongue off of her clit while she continued to rub herself with her hand... I wanted to hear it as soon as I got a chance to see it... if I could.</p> <p>"I feel like I'm the luckiest woman on earth," she whispered as her body twitched a little in reaction to what I had done to her. She leaned her head back against my shoulder and I took it as a sign of pleasure while thrusting my tongue at her clit once more. It only took a short time before she came as loud as she could, her body quivered and jerked like she did during high school.</p> <p>When she was done, her hand slipped away from my balls and began to stroke it, she smiled weakly at me as my tongue went back to work again. "I have a surprise for you, Tom," she murmured in my ear. "It will be nice to have something you can wear for the rest of the day."</p> <p>"Um, what kind of surprise?" I asked as I continued my tonguing of her pussy... I looked for her face to tell what she had in mind if she knew what it was.</p> <p>"Just a little something that will get me going quicker but will take me to far later," she said with a big smile as she looked at me and licked her lips. "Can you see anyone down there?" she asked as the tip of my cock stopped flinching after she said it and nodded her head to acknowledge the possibility. "I can help you find him, too."</p> <p>"Oh, ok," I responded as I slid my cock out of her pussy and moved it back to her opening. I was eager to begin getting a first finger in her now as it was easy enough. I inserted my fingers into her pussy quickly and felt her body give way and release a few more times due to my movements.</p> <p>"Mmmm... you were right... this may not be very fair though," she said with a wink, which was what I wanted to hear at this point. I leaned forward and kissed her as I fingered her a little more with each thrust of my fingers.</p> <p>"I don't want to wait for him to do anything," I moaned as I pulled my fingers away from her pussy and continued the fingering in slow motion. "I feel like I could do this all day long," I said with an evil grin as I continued with my fingering.</p> <p>"Mmmm... I don't know.... I feel like I really enjoy sucking his cock... and now I'm going to have to go down on him."</p> <p>"I know you will!" She said and laughed lightly before leaning over to kiss me again. "Just let me have it tonight, ok?" I nodded and moved my fingers away from her opening which gave an audible "pop" to indicate my eagerness to go down on her.</p> <p>"Good," she said as she lifted her head up from my shoulder, kissed me again and licked her lips before nodding to say she was going to be here this weekend again. "If I may... I will be working for him very, very little for him. Just as your girlfriend, if she even has time to think of anything else."</p> <p>"Sounds good to me," I said as I grabbed her and rolled her onto her stomach, lifted her sexy thighs and pushed them apart. I kissed at her pussy as she lay there, enjoying the feel of my cock rubbing against her ass as I pressed the head into her and let the warmth spread through her.</p> <p>"Mmmmmm... you feel so wonderful!" I whispered into her pussy as I moved my cock up and down along her crack. I could still see it moving and I leaned my head forward as she wrapped her legs around me and let her pussy slowly spread around my cockâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
