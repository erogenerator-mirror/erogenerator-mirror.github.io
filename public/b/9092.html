I'm not sure why I'm asking if I can touch her legs, but somehow I could imagine rubbing up and down with my hand all afternoon. I've been trying to think of a way to go about this without any further attention.</p> <p>"Are you going to let me do that later?" she asks. "After I come. And you, I can do anything I want to you."</p> <p>"Mandy."</p> <p>"What are you going to do?" she asks.</p> <p>"I'm going to take care of that pussy a little now." I say as I go to take my pants and my shirt off and get comfortable. For a moment I think I need a good scrubbing, but it wasn't meant to be. I just need to take care of my needs, not have a woman I just met, do my job, and get some sexual satisfaction. Not one man's loss.</p> <p>We're lying on her bed, and she's still breathing hard. "That was so good. It felt like you were a little rough earlier. I'm glad there was no pain to it. I don't know if I can make myself come again if I keep that up or not."</p> <p>"I'm sure you're ready for me, Mandy."</p> <p>"Oh, do you really think so?"</p> <p>"We don't have too much time," I say before I kiss her again. Our bodies are both slick with some of the same juices I've been eating. She makes a little noise but she's not mad. "You don't have to worry about me coming again before we get dressed."</p> <p>"I'll be gentle," she says. "That was fantastic. I like it when I get like that."</p> <p>"Me too."</p> <p>While I get dressed, I'm thinking about what I'll do to that ass when I get it. "Maybe, I'll have to start at the top," I think.</p> <p>As she returns, she's carrying several towels, and a bottle of lotion. "These lotioning's different. You'll want to rub some on, don't you?" She's wearing a black bikini that doesn't seem to be particularly revealing.</p> <p>"Yeah," I say. "I know. I'll let you decide. Now just sit on the mattress over here."</p> <p>I'm sitting on the end of the bed. She climbs on top of me, and begins to rub my stomach and chest. Her large breasts are squishing between us as a result of her sitting on me. I'm feeling like a man who's about to come from a massage. She doesn't do it for me - she's just getting things started.</p> <p>Then she's sitting on me, with her legs over my thighs. She's rubbing my lower chest. She doesn't have that rough feeling that usually goes through me, but now it's all she does is help.</p> <p>"Do you use lotion here?" I ask her. She slides a little way over me and it feels so good.</p> <p>"Not that special."</p> <p>"How about when I do this for you?"</p> <p>"Yes, it's very special."</p> <p>"Doesn't it feel good?"</p> <p>"Sure - it feels good, but it feels different."</p> <p>"And good?"</p> <p>"Mmm. It's almost like... like I'm just being intimate. Oh my goodness." I'm breathing hard.</p> <p>"I don't like to feel guilty about that. Why don't you turn over a little more and I can do the rest."</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>She doesn't seem to mind, though I would guess she doesn't know the difference between having fun before and masturbating afterwards. And that makes it a good time to get her out of her top and off me. I feel her move to the center of the bed. She picks up the lotion and begins rubbing it all over my chest.</p> <p>"Spread your legs!" I say. To what? She doesn't understand, so I use her hand to spread it over my pussy. She stops for a long moment, waiting for a reply.</p> <p>"Spread your legs a little wider," I say, which she doesn't seem to hear at first because her mind is elsewhere.</p> <p>"Yes." She says to me with a smile. She starts spreading the lotion again as I continue to open my legs. I can feel the feeling spreading between my legs and I see her starting to rub her fingers up and down - first one, then another. Just a little farther. She has an almost wicked smile on her face.</p> <p>"Why don't you take this off?" I say, and she immediately follows with her top off, leaving her magnificent breasts exposed as they hang down. Her nipples are hard little nubs.</p> <p>When I finally tell herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
