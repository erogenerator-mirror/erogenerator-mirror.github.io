But I'm sure this is the only way you'll ever have the opportunity to wear them in the office. Besides, when I get a chance to show off my new bikini, I'm sure someone will be willing to help me make it the envy of every guy in town."</p> <p>She started to protest, but I put my finger to her lips. "Let's not argue with your decision. There would still be plenty of other ways for me to wear these skimpy bikinis at the store tomorrow."</p> <p>As I had originally planned, I had been very thorough about buying the bikini, which I had picked up back when they were in my dad's storage room. For that reason I decided to take my time and buy some new bikini with my old. It might just go with a hot tub or something. I was about to call up to the shop on another night, when I heard someone come in. I got out to see who it was. It was the sales assistant from the beachwear department.</p> <p>She was wearing a halter-type dress from the last show I had seen her in front of me. She had been wearing it all day and to say she looked great was the understatement of the year. I was glad to see how long this swimsuit was so she had a bit more cleavage than usual.</p> <p>"Well, hello, I'm Jason, what can I do for you?"</p> <p>I could tell she was a little nervous, so I put my arms around her neck and kissed her full on the lips. "Hi, Jason, I'm Kelly and this is my wife, Kelly."</p> <p>I got her to sit down and handed her a drink. "And, I'm Jason, and this is my girlfriend, Kelly." I kissed her again. "I've been thinking about you every day since we were kids. It's been so nice to see you and hearing your voice..."</p> <p>I told her how I'd grown up a lot since that day and she made me feel good by opening up.</p> <p>"I can't really say how happy it's made me to hear you say that. I've been feeling really good about myself too. But Kelly, this is so much better than the usual way to be with you guys at the store."</p> <p>She just leaned against me and started to tell me all about when my mom started to tell me about her life as a cheerleader starting in college.</p> <p>"So, mom, what's it like being an adult?"</p> <p>"It's really amazing not to have to do that. I was just as excited by it as I was when I got here. I know it sounds weird because you and I are only a couple of years apart and I know it's hard for you to understand. But there's no need to talk about being anything more than my son."</p> <p>"I really like you though. If it wasn't for this morning, I wouldn't be here anymore."</p> <p>She grinned and gave me a quick kiss and gave me one of those quick peck on the cheek, when she stepped back and said, "I don't know why I had to call you and give you a phone call, but let me make up for it. Now you know how I feel about you."</p> <p>"I think it's a turn on for both of us to do that."</p> <p>Kelly walked me out to my car which was a very nice looking two-seater. We chatted about the afternoon and what had happened. I noticed my stepdaughter looking at me with a quizzical look on her face. The look had nothing to do with the swimsuit that she was wearing. That was all. Nothing else. I just smiled at her and told her she could get in any girl's clothes that she wanted.</p> <p>After a while, she leaned against the trunk and said, "So, I guess you don't want to be that old man anymore yet. So, why don't you just leave it behind. I don't have to try to look as good as mom always asks."</p> <p>She turned to my wife and smiled. "I really enjoyed knowing the kind of things you guys have to try to do."</p> <p>"Kelly, did you enjoy being your own daughter the same way you enjoyed giving your first blowjob to me?"</p> <p>"Yes, Jason. I truly enjoyed it. I think I can give an extra blowjob now."</p> <p>"Don't worry. You're going to be on all fours right now, but you can do plenty of you know, mom."</p> <p>Kelly giggled before getting out of the car and kissing me on the cheek.
