"Hey don't be daft. You know all this shit's up in the air, right?"</p> <p>"Oh yeah." She was looking down my body as we both continued to enjoy the view. "Come down here. I wanna see what you're doing. Don't worry, I know you're fuckin' with her head. And when you're finished with me, I'll tell you what I want, so you know how to do it."</p> <p>We stood looking at her. We each had a beer, and he kept checking out my butt and the way I was swaying.</p> <p>I felt one of his hands rubbing me. He slowly slid it down towards my butt. He kept his other hand on my other cheek. I couldn't control my moaning as he touched me, and it was like it was a drug.</p> <p>"Hey you look sooo damn sweet, honey. It's been too long baby."</p> <p>I just kept gyrating my hips in rhythm with his hand. My head was spinning. I took a long drink of my beer like that and felt a hot burst of pleasure rush through my body. He kept rubbing, and now I took my hand and ran it up my thigh. My breathing was short.</p> <p>"Don't stop babe!!" I was barely able to speak as I felt myself being squished, and then something wet and warm was sliding into my pussy.</p> <p>"Oh my goodness. Do you like that?"</p> <p>"Y-Yes!"</p> <p>"Well, I'm a little disappointed, and kinda horny for you. But baby, just enjoy, you know you liked it, didn't you, you sweet licked your pussy, so I didn't get mad?"</p> <p>"Oh God yes. You know exactly how to go about getting me horny."</p> <p>"You wanna get me all hot and bothered, and then go and jerk off?"</p> <p>"Sure baby. But I want to save the other thing for later."</p> <p>"Oh, and I still need to see how good pussy sucking can get, isn't it honey?"</p> <p>"Yes! I really want to. It's been a real long time."</p> <p>He leaned over and put his ear in my pussy, and I felt his fingers slide up and down in my crack. Then he reached his fingers around my butt in front of me. I could feel his fingers go to my asshole and run round and round.</p> <p>I'm not kidding, I thought. He went a lot of the way around, and I felt him press his fingers against the outside of my ass, all the way around. A finger, oh, oh, a finger felt good there. They went round and round. And it went deeper and deeper.</p> <p>"You wanna do it doggie style?" He asked.</p> <p>"Oh, I wanna."</p> <p>He reached in both hands and pulled my lips apart, opening me up. My hole was open, so he went in in one smooth motion. And oh, did it feel good.</p> <p>He pulled his fingers out, and I said, "Omigod!"</p> <p>"Don't worry babe! No one can know!" he said.</p> <p>"But...but it's really nasty..."</p> <p>"Sure babe, I'm cool with that," he said.</p> <p>He went back to playing around with my pussy. And I felt it get wetter and wetter. He started sliding his fingers in and out of my pussy, and I was loving every minute of it. I had never had anything like this happen, and I started to get closer to the edge.</p> <p>"You ready, baby?" He said.</p> <p>I just nodded my head. He put his lips on mine and slid his tongue into my mouth. We kissed and tongued our tongues. He reached down my front and spread my pussy open again. I felt his finger slide into my pussy. The thing seemed to go in easily.</p> <p>"Oh yeah!" I said.</p> <p>This was getting way better. It had never happened to me before. But it felt so good, and I was gonna go out of my mind if he kept doing it like that. I felt something bigger at my asshole. I hadn't had any of that for a long time, and it was moving up and down the crack of my ass. It was slick, and moved against my anal hole. I could feel it going in and out. I felt it rub against me.</p> <p>I felt some more finger being pushed into me. It wasn't a real finger, but just a thick one. My whole face felt like I was being twisted around by something.
