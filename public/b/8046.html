I didn't see the point of that at all. This was an emotional night. I just kept thinking what I could do. I was never going to do anything like this but whatever I could do, whatever I could find out, I could do.</p> <p>"Please don't be mad at me." I could see his face turn red by his admission.</p> <p>"I think about you all the time." I gave this statement my all. "I guess my world is about to be filled with you."</p> <p>We were right. I felt so much like the mother of him. I felt a special connection to him now and it was obvious that was going to be the key to becoming part of him.</p> <p>We kissed gently and held each other as he tried to get his life back under my control.</p> <p>"Oh my God, I am sorry." Then, "I'm sorry I just can't stop thinking about you. I feel the same way about you."</p> <p>"And I want to be with you forever, okay, Mom?"</p> <p>I nodded. I could tell that neither was going to be much longer.</p> <p>I didn't want the night to end but somehow knew I wasn't giving up on him. I knew that no matter what, I loved the man that was with me, regardless of what his name was, what his job was, what his life was. It was just too soon for me to start making the long distance arrangements for a sexual relationship but there was something about him I couldn't live without. So I agreed.</p> <p>He was an amazing lover and it felt so natural. Nothing felt as natural to him as it did but, he liked me. He loved me. I knew it was time to get on with my life.</p> <p>We finished the bottle of wine and I set the glasses on the table and we left the room without saying another word. He said he had to go meet his new best friends but that he wanted to meet me as well. I smiled and said he shouldn't be too far along. Then he looked at me with a confused expression and said, "I have my own life now but I want you to know that I am happy with it. I don't want to break that connection with you but there is still pain and a part of me wants to leave."</p> <p>"I want to be with you forever," I said as I leaned over to give him a kiss on the lips. "I will never go down that road again," I said in my sultriest voice. He just looked at me.</p> <p>My lips were so soft and gentle. I could taste alcohol on my lips. Our kiss never seemed to end.</p> <p>"I have to go now," he said once we were out of the room.</p> <p>I nodded and put my hand on the side of his neck as he walked into the bedroom. I thought it was sweet but it was a little too early to start a relationship.</p> <p>Chapter 20.</p> <p>"Mom, I love you so much" I said as he turned and kissed me deeply. I held his face tightly. We kissed like there was no tomorrow. My body was tingling and I didn't care what tomorrow brought. But this was just so perfect. He didn't seem to notice my nervousness. It took all my courage to try and break away. But before I could, he quickly grabbed my hand and we rushed out the door. I didn't care how the night was ending but I didn't want to lose him in my anxiety. I wanted to be with him in every way that mattered.</p> <p>Chapter 21.</p> <p>I was at my best but I didn't care. It was perfect. I needed to be with him, I needed to feel my body against his again. I had made my decision and didn't think it would happen.</p> <p>He hadn't said a word while we were in the bedroom. He just looked up at me and said, "Just wait right there."</p> <p>A minute later, he was standing there.</p> <p>"Mom, it's ok. I know it won't be ok but, please give me your phone."</p> <p>I was stunned. He wanted me to take my phone away from my son. I would have said yes. But in the moment; no, I was not going to do anything like that. It was better for me, more stable. But I felt I owed it to myself to take my mobile phone from our son's hand.</p> <p>I walked up to him and he stepped back to admire my body before I took my mobile phone from my hand. He walked up to the bed and threw it over my brother's head and laughed.</p> <p>"Oh, I think that's too sexy for a woman of your age," he said with a laugh.</p> <p>He got on the bed and pushed his body against mine.
