After a couple minutes of this, there was nothing I could do to stop him. He reached down in the darkness and stuck two fingers in my pussy and said, "I need you to help me with this."</p> <p>I reached down to guide his fingers into my pussy and he said, "Oh fuck, you're making me feel so full now, baby." After a second or two, he slipped his fingers out of my pussy and used his index finger to open my ass cheeks and push his head all the way in.</p> <p>"That feels so good, baby," I moaned as his head filled my ass.</p> <p>His dick was now completely inside me and I was able to take it. He was so long, just the right thickness that I could feel myself getting ready to get off. I felt so full with him inside me. "I want it."</p> <p>As I was thinking, he began really pulling out and driving it back into me, filling me with his dick again, just the way I had made him use me before.</p> <p>Then something in the darkness gave a shiver from inside the plane. The cabin was quiet and the flight was going by slowly. The plane's engine began to go up and down. Soon, the sound of his thighs hitting mine began to pick up in intensity. Soon, the feeling of his dick in my ass became more and more urgent. One of his hands pulled on my nipples a little, stretching them to the point of pain. The other reached for my clit and squeezed it, while I reached back with my fingers to rub my pussy just right.</p> <p>Another shiver went through my body. Suddenly, I felt his fingers come into contact with my g-spot. This was all my pussy was on fire, but my fingers continued on my clit. I was surprised when the plane started to slow down. My head and shoulders were light, but my mind was completely on sensory overload.</p> <p>"That felt good, baby," I panted as he began to pull out of my ass. He pushed in just as the plane stopped and went up the next one, leaving my ass feeling empty.</p> <p>I grabbed the seat again, trying to hold on, wanting to keep feeling what I had just felt. Finally, he pulled him dick out of my ass. Suddenly, I felt the cold air fill it and I could feel my ass. It burned a little, but this was the only thing that made all the sense in my head.</p> <p>Finally, he said, "Oh, I'm sorry, baby, I almost came inside you. Please forgive me."</p> <p>He didn't say a word, he just leaned in and kissed me deeply. We kissed, not saying a word.</p> <p>At the next stop, another load was passing, and another person was in the seats next to mine. We stopped again, but this time, he stopped in his seat at the next stop. His mouth moved from mine to my ear then to my neck and I could feel his teeth grazing the skin. I knew he must have been watching. I felt him take my hand and bring it to his dick. There is something about having my hand wrapped around my cock that has always turned me on and made me wet, now it was like nothing at all had happened. He guided my hand away from him and down his leg. I couldn't move. I felt the hard wood of his leg beneath me as my fingers traced up his leg and to the knee.</p> <p>He slowly lifted himself up, putting the side of his leg on my side. He slowly removed his hand from mine. I could feel the taut muscles of his thigh and calf. I could feel the weight of his body, his shoulders and his arms on me, his chest against my hair. I knew he was very excited. His dick was pulsing between my fingers, causing me the need to slide down in the seat. I moved my hand to his dick and put my lips to my ear.</p> <p>"Touch my dick," I asked.</p> <p>Instinctively, he spread his legs wide. I moved my hand up to the base of his dick. His dick was fully hard now, throbbing and ready to explode. My fingers wrapped around my own cock and I began stroking as I said, "I want you inside me now, sweetheart."</p> <p>He said, "Is that ok?"</p> <p>I said, "You're not going to hurt me? I just want you to start getting in my ass right away, baby."</p> <p>"Ok, baby," he replied. "It's ok."</p> <p>A few more of the flight passed, but never felt this good. His body was so warm, with the smell of his freshly washedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
