His lips moved to my breasts, and his tongue licked up and down to the nipple on the left. He sucked harder now, his fingers working my clit, and I cried out for more.</p> <p>"Harder." I cried out to him. He pulled back, his mouth moving to my nipple again. He suckled softly then harder. I cried out again and he licked his lips at once. I came, my hips pressing forward.</p> <p>He was grinning at that, his thumb rubbing my clit to make sure it was ok. He kept working my nipple until I came down from there, then he slid up me and I could feel his dick pulsing as he slid up my body, his cock teasing me with the head of it.</p> <p>"Oh God, Ben. I love you so much."</p> <p>He kissed his way down my stomach then, dipping lower with his chin, and I felt his tongue touching the lips of my pussy gently. He pushed in a little, and I felt him slide in a little bit, then he was stroking back and forth between my pussy and my ass.</p> <p>"Please, please please Ben -- I need to feel you inside me."</p> <p>"You're all wet, I guess. Why don't you lie back and open up?"</p> <p>I laid onto the bed and he climbed over my hips. I felt the head of his dick at my entrance as he slid slowly in. I looked up at him, my hands moving to the sheets. He didn't make a sound as he entered me. He stayed put as he slid in, slowly but steadily, and I moaned a little.</p> <p>"Your pussy feels so good." He whispered, his full lips near my ear.</p> <p>He lifted his hips and we ground together, his penis sliding easily into me, all of us. Slowly, I felt him pressing on my insides, his hands pulling at my hips, urging me on. I could feel the friction inside me. He was hard enough that it hurt and it made me feel good, and I felt pleasure from him.</p> <p>"Oh God, Ben. God, your dick is burning to be inside of me. Please don't be mad at me for being stupid." I said.</p> <p>My tears continued to fall, and I had never felt so good in my life, and I was trying to tell him so.</p> <p>"I've never been mad before, but you make me crazy. Please don't stop, love," he said, his voice soft, but heavy with lust.</p> <p>"Oh Ben, I've never been mad. I don't think I'll ever be mad. Please don't stop." I whispered.</p> <p>I felt him begin to move faster, driving himself in, and then I felt him pulling out of me, and I felt him sliding back in again. I looked and saw his eyes shut, his mouth open. I felt him thrusting faster and harder while his hands grabbed my hips and lifted.</p> <p>"I'm coming." He cried out in my ear and I came on his cock as it drove into me.</p> <p>I felt him pulsing between my legs, and I pulled him in my arms and wrapped them around him.</p> <p>"Ben, fuck me. I'm coming again, so fucking hard." I cried and shuddered on my own orgasm. I could tell that he was coming too, and we were both shaking all over.</p> <p>As we lay there, holding each other tightly in silence, his hands running over my body, I could feel his cock shrinking inside me a little, and I felt him rolling off on his side. I snuggled up into his arms, his hand stroking mine.</p> <p>"I guess I did say I wanted to get drunk," he said, his eyes going to my face.</p> <p>"Yeah, me too," I replied, smiling, and kissing him. "Well, why don't you come up to my room, and we'll see what happens."</p> <p>"Oh, I don't know," he said. "I guess we'll have to just stay right here."</p> <p>"We really do have to get back," I said, kissing him on the cheek. Then I rolled away and got off the bed, turning to go.</p> <p>"Ben, where would you like me to go," I asked.</p> <p>"I'm not sure, but if you can find a hotel that we can stay at, maybe I can get my room cleaned and reek of your cum."</p> <p>I smiled as I walked past him to my car for him to open for me. I could see his eyes roaming over my body.</p> <p>"I'm not taking any shit for youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
