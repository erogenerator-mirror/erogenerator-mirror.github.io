She was about to leave the bar after all? It was almost like a trap, she just knew she wanted to go somewhere. They were both too far away to get to. Still, this whole crazy situation was so crazy, it just gave her a big rush.</p> <p>The bartender looked through the mirror on the wall, and gave her a knowing smirk. "Good night... you... look fantastic!"</p> <p>She blushed a little at the compliment. It did make her feel good, that was another thought.</p> <p>"I think we're ready," she said. "So is this part of my special gift this morning?" she asked, with a little smile on her face.</p> <p>"Oh, yes! Absolutely," he replied.</p> <p>She didn't know what to do. She had this sudden impulse to throw caution to the wind. She went to the nearest exit, towards the exit of the bar. As she approached, she saw a man with a strange smile on his face, looking at her with interest.</p> <p>"It's your turn now," he said. He turned and saw her face. He looked familiar. She was sure he recognized the smile, or perhaps saw it in her eyes.</p> <p>"Oh good then. You're the first of several people to see me before I'm done," she said with a smile. He looked at her, puzzled.</p> <p>"Do I already already?" he finally said.</p> <p>"You already did," she said. He didn't say anything. Instead, he grabbed his cell phone off the bar and began dialing.</p> <p>"Hello, this is David," a female voice said. "I just had a call from a friend."</p> <p>'Oh, shit... how did he get so familiar with her?' she thought. She really looked hot. "Oh, I'm sorry. That was a long call."</p> <p>"Not your usual?" the woman said.</p> <p>"No, that's alright," she replied nervously. A very awkward pause followed.</p> <p>"I had a call from my husband. It sounded rather ominous. I figured it was just something about not being able to spend too much time with you in a few days and getting your things all packed up," she explained.</p> <p>"Well, he seems like a good guy. Maybe we could all get together next week after I've been with him?" she suggested, in an attempt to sound innocent.</p> <p>"That might be possible. I think he's going to like it," she said, trying to convince herself with the information.</p> <p>"He's such a sweetie," she told him, still trying to convince herself. It would be no different than how he reacted when he discovered she was on the phone, that way they had the whole weekend to spend together. There was no way she could stop him from going to the bar with her.</p> <p>"Okay, so you could join us. Can you drive?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes, unfortunately, yes that would be wonderful!" he responded, with an enthusiastic smile on his face. He was obviously a good man.</p> <p>"Excellent, now let's go," she said, stepping over towards the exit. She turned to him and gave him a peck on the lips that went straight for his lips. "I'll take care of the rest. Bye," she said, again turning to leave. He stared at her, as she had been about to turn to leave. This woman was incredible.</p> <p>'She was incredible. She could have been my own personal concubine,' he thought. This lady was a keeper, what little he knew about women.</p> <p>*</p> <p>David's wife, Lisa, was a really sexy looking woman, she had a great body. Her breasts, while not quite as big as her husband's were ample, and even they were ample, as a group they all appreciated. She always felt great looking great, it turned her on to be so desired, by men, particularly her husband.</p> <p>David himself was quite an average looking man. He stood at about 6'2", and weighed about 190 pounds. He had a fairly average physique, with a somewhat chiseled look. His hair was jet black, and was obviously Italian, though he was clearly Italian also, his eyes were dark and seemed almost gray.</p> <p>He was divorced, but his wife had remarried when she was in her late twenties, who had the child to come from. She was pretty in a rugged way, with long red-brown hair, and piercing blue eyes which made her seem the most dangerous woman he had ever met. She was a beautiful woman, even for her age, who always had a very strong sense for her surroundings.</p> <p>David had come to see herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
