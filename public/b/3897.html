She said.</p> <p>"I got that in the first place. Your right. I guess."</p> <p>"Thanks."</p> <p>She grabbed her dress. "But if you don't want me to, maybe you should find someone else."</p> <p>I turned bright red again, but didn't say anything. She got on her knees and looked at my pants. I looked like an animal; I felt nauseated with hunger, even fear. She looked at the bulge in my pants and asked, "How far has this got your cock growing?"</p> <p>"How far have these?"</p> <p>"If you can show me," I said.</p> <p>She was about to pull my pants down and fuck me, and as always, she did just that. She went all the way down on my dick. I thought I was gonna die. It felt so good in her mouth and she sucked me furiously. I shot down her throat.</p> <p>We just lay there. Both completely drained, but both trying to get their breath back. After what seemed like forever, she rose, cleaned herself off, gave me a soft kiss, and then turned to leave. I could have sworn she left her robe on the bedpost. She walked in front of her closet and turned on the light. I looked at my watch. It was only 10:00. I had nothing better to do but wait for my wife. That night proved that she was the right girl for meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
