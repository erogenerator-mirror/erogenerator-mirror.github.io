My thighs and arms were wrapped around her back, holding her close while my hips rose and fell rapidly. She was thrusting wildly up into me, her thighs squeezing me firmly in a way she had never experienced. I was in lust now, her breasts jiggling as we began to move together. Our moans and groans were growing louder, our tongues exploring each other's mouth passionately.</p> <p>Her hands were roaming around my breasts, exploring all the other parts of my body; squeezing and caressing with little slaps on my back, hips and thighs. My hands were still working on her breasts so far but now they were doing all the work, gently pinching her nipples and massaging the soft curves of her breasts.</p> <p>We were both breathing heavily and gasping. Suddenly I could feel the tremble building up and she groaned my name, "Oh. . .Oh." Her body jerked and her nails dug into the skin of my back.</p> <p>Then something happened. "Oh, Mom, I'm gonna...I'm gonna come!!"</p> <p>Her voice was husky and she had a wild, breathless look in her eyes. Then she suddenly shuddered, came and she groaned with the most intense, intense pleasure she had ever given a lover as my hips were still thrusting wildly into her, grinding our pubic mounds into one another. Her body was trembling now and I felt the warmth of her vagina squeezing my cock as we came together. She fell back down onto me, panting. We were still moving slowly to some sort of rhythm of mutual pleasure. I couldn't believe what just happened then, as I had never done in my life. It was so much more than just motherly lovemaking; it was more than just motherly affection. We were each other's new lover, and we were in love.</p> <p>I was still lying on top of her after a few minutes of rest. She reached behind me, took my hand and held it against her breast. Then she lifted her head and kissed me like her mother, gently but deliberately. I returned her kiss and it was such a gentle thing we kissed tenderly. The kiss of lovers is what we needed and what we needed for each other to feel this way.</p> <p>"It's your turn now," she said. With that I moved up her body, sliding my cock back and forth inside her. Our combined juices felt thicker against my skin. As I began to move again, I felt those muscles in her body begin to tighten again. "Oh," she said, "oh, God, I'm going to come again. God—ohhhh!" Her voice shook as she started to tremble. I held still for a moment, reveling in her beauty, my cock hardening and throbbing hard inside her. Now I could continue to watch her as she orgasms, looking at her face. I could smell her excitement—her excitement and the scent of sex.</p> <p>"You feel wonderful, Mom," I said, beginning to move again. Even as I began to move, I was thinking about what we had just done, how wonderfully we had made each other feel. As I slid out a little I marveled at the way her juices had made her pussy swell and become more wet. And then she started shaking again as she came. She pulled me to her, hugging me, moaning and groaning.</p> <p>Soon I had to catch my breath. Still locked like this she whispered, "It's your turn now." I lifted my head, gazed into her sparkling eyes, saw that she was still trembling beneath me. I held her close, and kissed her on the forehead as she lay there. "Are you okay?" she asked with a husky voice.</p> <p>"Do I?" I asked with a smile and a laugh. She kissed me hard on the lips and said, "I'm still going on a wild streak. But this time...I can be a really wild one—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
