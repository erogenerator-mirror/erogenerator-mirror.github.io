He seemed a little surprised too, and asked, "Who's the best player out there over there?"</p> <p>"Oh, that's him. The last one out here was an idiot. I got lucky a few times but none were as good as you though."</p> <p>"That's because he was a really good player. I'm not even talking about his skills."</p> <p>"It wasn't so good that he didn't get a lot of points, there were too many hands."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"No, he got a lot of points by playing for long, long periods, and won them in that fashion. He got the ball away from the basket most times and had several points for good points."</p> <p>"I didn't expect it, but he was good at that too. There were too many free shots for him, so I figured that was to be the way of the season for him."</p> <p>Dylan laughed, but then added, "Not too high of a season though. He's been great since you were born."</p> <p>Dawn had been so busy, and had not seen Dylan's birthday since two weeks earlier. She had missed him. "Oh, you've been waiting longer?"</p> <p>"What can I say. No need to rush an occasion. I've been a little busy."</p> <p>"Well, at least go on down to the ice. They have the ice on fire this year, a lot of things have been out there. Take your time and see what is happening this year, I'll keep an eye on it closely after it has been a very stressful day."</p> <p>"You are always doing that to me, Denny."</p> <p>"Just because. The ice is so hot for you."</p> <p>***********</p> <p>"Hey, what are we doing tonight?" Dawn looked up at Dylan from the corner of her eye.</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"Nothing. I haven't gotten to spend it either..."</p> <p>"Well, let me have one of those kisses." He laughed, and planted his mouth on hers.</p> <p>Dawn let Dylan suck on her lips for a moment, and then looked at him and said, "I don't know how anyone could kiss."</p> <p>"You don't know me, but you've done it before. It's just a game; not much else."</p> <p>"Yeah, but you really are funny, and you've got an amazing kiss too," she said.</p> <p>"You know I'm just teasing. You know I'm not that kind of guy."</p> <p>Dawn chuckled and then sighed when Dylan took her hands and put them back on her chest. "Oh, I get it. You're too weird."</p> <p>"I feel a little silly, but you know what? This has been fun. I just wish you would stop and try it again."</p> <p>"You know if you do this a lot, we'll have more fun. Just keep doing it."</p> <p>"I can't promise you that."</p> <p>"I promise you that," Dylan said.</p> <p>"I've got to get back home, so go to the rink. I'm tired already and I want to get to bed."</p> <p>"Yes, ma'am, of course. I'll be here."</p> <p>"Good night. I love you."</p> <p>***********</p> <p>"Good night Denny. I really love you," Dawn said as they lay down in the grass to go to sleep.</p> <p>"Good night, ma'am. I love you."</p> <p>Dawn took Dylan's hand and laid it on her right breast, and he gently cupped and squeezed each breast, just the way he liked to be touched.</p> <p>"Oh, my. I love you."</p> <p>"I love you too, Dawn," Dylan said softly.</p> <p>***********</p> <p>Dylan had fallen asleep to the sound of her voice. He woke up before Dawn, and as he looked at the clock it was nearly nine. He saw Dawn's silhouette as she crawled out of bed. As he opened the room door, he saw a car parked in the driveway, and parked it. The car had the lights on. He was disappointed. He wanted her to be ready by tomorrow afternoon, so he had something else to do after a long day at work.</p> <p>Dawn was still sleeping and didn't wake up until he reached over and cupped her face in his hand. He stroked her face gently and said, "There, there. I promise you that, Denny."</p> <p>"I love you too, Dylan." She got out of bed and took his hand in hersâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
