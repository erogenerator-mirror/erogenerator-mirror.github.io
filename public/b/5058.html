Her hair was dark. Her eyes were a dark brown. She had a smile on her face.</p> <p>They went back into the lounge area to find a table. As they moved up the stairs, I walked past and stopped in the middle of the lounge, grabbed the napkin from my pocket and put the napkin down on the table, and then pulled her close to me and gave a quick peck on her lips, "Oh."</p> <p>She smiled seductively as she turned her head away from me, "It's good to see you again. This is a nice place. I'm surprised we didn't have to go back and forth to my room."</p> <p>I was wondering how we were going to deal with this when I suddenly felt her hands on my thigh. Without looking back, she slowly moved her hands up to the waist of my pants, grabbed a hold of my waist, pulled me close, and kissed me again. This time she pulled her head up to press her lips against mine hard. Her body was close to me, so I grabbed onto her body from the waist up and pulled her close to me. I could feel her breasts pressing against my chest, her hard nipples poking into me. She rubbed herself back and forth against me. I wrapped my arms around her, holding her closer. Her naked body was rubbing against me; both of us enjoying the sensation. Our tongues and hands explored each other, exploring every inch of each others' bodies. I had brought her into this passionate embrace; the first time I had had anything in my mouth. It wasn't just her body touching mine. It was the taste of her skin and scent of her skin. She was hot and wet.</p> <p>As we lay together, she kept on kissing away my mouth, my chest. She slowly, sensually, unzipped my pants and slid them down my legs. She then removed my shirt completely. She then started on my shirt. "You're so lucky", she whispered to me as she slowly licked the front of my chest. She moved her way up and kissed my stomach. She gently stroked my thigh with a nail and kissed my stomach again. Then she moved up to my stomach. She kissed the upper part of my stomach as she moved upward to the top of my thighs. She kissed and tongued the inside of my thighs, sending shivers through my body. I could feel her hot breath on me as her tongue flicked against my now very hard cock. Her fingers worked their way up the insides of my legs. As she kissed my lips, her fingers brushed against my cock. Then she slid her hand along the length of my hard cock, rubbing, squeezing, caressing. She moved her lips to the tip of my cock. She licked the drop of pre cum which had formed on the tip of my cock. She put the tip of her tongue lightly on the tip of my cock and then took the slit of my cock into her mouth.</p> <p>A groan escaped from my lips. "Oh....my....god" was all I could get out between the sounds escaping my lips. She slid her head down my cock. I heard her start to gag a bit. Then it started to feel different. And she took more of my cock into her mouth and held it there for a while. Then I felt her tongue run along the length of my hard cock and start to lick up again. She made love to my cock with her mouth. The feeling was incredible. I could feel her taking every inch of my cock in her mouth. My hands were gently rubbing against her back, moving back and forth, feeling her movements against me.</p> <p>Finally I felt her tongue leave my cock and slide along my shaft, licking up the sides. She worked her way up my cock again, taking my hard cock back into her mouth. She had a wonderful and slow rhythm going. I could feel her warm spit dripping down my cock as she worked back and forth. Then a little harder. I felt it running down my shaft.</p> <p>She started to take me faster. My hands were still rubbing down her back. I had a strong urge to feel her tits. As I started to move my hands up, she stopped me and told me to sit down on the couch and raise my legs. I slowly sat down on the couch. Her breasts are perfect. Her nipples hard as rocks, and a smile on her face, she looked down at me and said, "I've never been eaten like this" She put her lips next to my balls and licked them. I couldn't resist and let out a sharp gasp.</p> <p>I saw a fire begin in her eyes. Slowly her tongue went in and out of her mouth making little licks all around the outside but in between. She took my hardon into her mouth again. I could feel it being held in her hand, massaging itselfâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
