I was already halfway out of my car and walking toward the house.</p> <p>"You should stay. A night in your bed is good for that."</p> <p>We walked through my back door together. I was in my room, on my bed, staring into the ceiling. A feeling came over me; I felt so alive. It was a nice warmth that made me feel warm and I took it inside.</p> <p>I was on the floor again, naked, with my head leaning against the wall. I felt him standing next to me, looking down at me. "I never thought I would feel my first date ever. Thank God, it's my anniversary."</p> <p>He leaned down and we kissed. Hard, and soft and passionate. We made out in the living room, where we made out like high school kids. And then, we came home.</p> <p>All of a sudden, I was feeling too guilty, and ashamed...I should have been paying more attention to his face, instead of his body. But, I felt like I should have been paying more attention to the night, for that kiss. Instead, I was having my pussy throbbed like a high school ringmaster when that kiss was the last on my mind.</p> <p>"Baby, you're getting too excited." I pulled his head closer to me, forcing him between my thighs. His lips were hot, and I parted them wide. His nose brushed my slit, and I gasped. "Oh, baby, that's what it feels like to kiss a pussy! That's it...that's the spot. Oh, baby..."</p> <p>I was getting off again, having an amazing sex-day with this sexy young man I had known for almost twenty years. But, it felt like a dream, which seemed so real.</p> <p>I moved my hand between us and touched the tip of his stiff cock. I touched it while holding his balls, and it felt really hot...really nice. I couldn't get over how big he is. And, I'm pretty sure he's bigger than average, maybe about 8 inches in girth, and I'm looking at those thick, dark, hairy balls.</p> <p>"Mh, baby. I want to do you. Now, make love to me."</p> <p>I felt like a teenager again, lying in bed, and all I could do now was to spread my legs. I reached down between his thighs and felt him. He was big, and smooth and hot. My fingers went to my slit, and I made wet soft noises as I felt him. My own pussy, which was feeling like I had just given birth, was dripping wet.</p> <p>I ran one finger in and out of my hole, and he moaned with my own touch. His other hand reached to my hipbone and he guided me toward his cock.</p> <p>I felt this massive bulge in his jeans, and he began to work me out of my pants and underwear. We kissed like wild animals, and he sucked my tongue to the breaking point. But, there was no chance of that, we could go home without getting fucked.</p> <p>"We have to stop. I want to be inside of you." I was breathing in gasps now, too loud for him to hear, but I'm not sure that I care.</p> <p>He said his magic words.</p> <p>Our hearts began to beat harder, and we knew it wouldn't be long. Suddenly, I felt his hands against my thighs. I could feel him between my legs. He had a firm grip on my naked flesh, and our kissing intensified. I was going to feel him all night, but he held me back with his fingers, so that his cock was fully in me.</p> <p>I began to breathe in heavy, ragged breaths. Our tongues touched, and I pulled him toward me with my hands.</p> <p>As he began to move inside of me I felt his balls touching me, and I pulled him hard. My pussy throbbed, even as the pain of his invasion felt like a dagger that was to stab him in his heart.</p> <p>"Jesus, baby! Slow down for a second. I want us to do this slow, not fast! But, do it!"</p> <p>He was going in and out very slowly. I felt warmness and warmth, as he entered me so smoothly. When he began to move inside of me, I felt wet, warm, and silky as if it was a million degrees.</p> <p>"Oh, that's so nice. Oh, that's perfect. It feels so good!" I felt the blood and muscle of his cock as it moved in and out, pushing in as far as he would go. He leaned against my belly and continued the slow steady movement. My breasts were now floating below me, so that I could look at them andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
