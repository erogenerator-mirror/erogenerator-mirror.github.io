He walked over to the couch and sat down. He took his shoes off and laid them across the arm. He walked around the couch looking at the bookshelves and the sofa. He could see there were several books but in the third shelf he could see several of his favorites were not on the shelves. There were several others on the sofa. He sat down and pulled out two fresh beers. He got up and walked toward the sofa.</p> <p>He sat down next to the man. "You like, huh?" His eyes flicked to the shelf beside him. "Do you like what you read?"</p> <p>"I do, but sometimes I only read to myself or in a novel."</p> <p>"That's not exactly what I mean. You read in the library often?"</p> <p>"Yes, sometimes I read, usually alone."</p> <p>"Well, if you want me to find something to read, I'll turn the lamps and read on the couch." He looked at his beer and then over at the shelf beside him. He noticed his watch and asked about it.</p> <p>"I think it's about 8:30. That's long enough to read and I guess I can find something to read. But it's not like the library is empty."</p> <p>"Is this not a book you like." He looked at the shelf beside him and then looked back at the shelf. "I read a book I like about romance and, well, sex."</p> <p>"Sex? Oh, I know about other stuff too, what with sex. What about you?"</p> <p>The man smiled and said, "I liked that book just about as well as I liked reading. In fact, I enjoy reading a lot so it was nice not to have to be careful if I liked what I read too much."</p> <p>"My pleasure. I didn't really find what I was looking for. Did you? When? Where?" All the while he felt himself getting hard.</p> <p>"On Thursday." He grinned at the expression on his face. "There is a really nice little store about 25 minutes away."</p> <p>"How did you get here?"</p> <p>"Not sure," the man said. "I just walked in. The guy who runs it told me they have book booths at their hotel and they know all the books but do not know how to enter them."</p> <p>"Have any free rooms where they can see them?"</p> <p>"Let me walk you to your room."</p> <p>They got up and walked to the little table and sat down. He looked across the room, "I know a few book booths with book racks. They have a lot of money."</p> <p>She looked around at the shelf, "That sounds good. How about you." She pointed to a corner. "There are two of them."</p> <p>"A booth, maybe?" When he nodded that he understood she told him to go to the nearest booth.</p> <p>He saw a young man get up and go to the booth but had no idea about any booth other than the one next to him, the one near by. He started across the room and got there. The booth he looked through and saw a woman walk by. He saw she had a blue silk robe on. He took his bag out and followed her back to the booth.</p> <p>He looked at the menu and said, "The first booth has a big selection of novels, romance and sex, and another with romance novels. The third booth has a big selection of books and a few paperback volumes."</p> <p>"Would you like me to go with you, maybe do a book or two?" She smiled.</p> <p>He shook his head, "Do you want me to go?"</p> <p>"No, stay around until you're ready."</p> <p>He took the food and the man went looking for book booths that sold a variety of the same novels as the other. "We'll go through that," he said. "There is one for women, too. The third booth is for women, too."</p> <p>She nodded and went to the other booth. He sat and walked through. After a few minutes he left the man to get another beer and walked to the third booth. He picked it up and went to a different booth. He walked up to the booth. It looked like a long, narrow booth with a curtain across the back. He walked up and sat. "Here," he said. "Please try it. I've seen it in a book store so there are three separate booths."</p> <p>She looked up, "Do I have to use your name?"</p> <p>"Only if you want to try two in both booths." He nodded and got up, "Just wait out here while I figure out what to do."</p> <p>He walked off and looked out a while. When he returned, he saw several of the books and some of the books wereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
