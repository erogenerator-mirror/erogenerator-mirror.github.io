We both know you have very little of it left," I said as we looked over the length of the house. The pool and grounds were only about one mile from the main house and only a short walk could be seen at this time of night.</p> <p>"I don't have all the answers to why I feel this way and it was all just an accident and I don't think you want to make me feel that way anymore. So don't get my hopes up, you old bitch! You think I am the only one that feels pretty and it's wrong to have a girl in my house. I'm old, and I'm not that damn young, and I'm ugly and I'm not that stupid. So stop being such a sweetheart and give me a hug and let's get started," Cindy said with a giggle, putting her arms around my neck and pulling me close. I felt a great stirring in my slacks and let her get me under control. After we broke our embrace, I looked around and saw the house lights on, and I noticed that I did not turn on the lights.</p> <p>"I am sorry, Cindy, but my family and friends are asleep and no one has heard anything all night. We need to look out if they're going to wake up. I'm sure Dad can make you feel the same way." I gave Cindy a quick kiss on the lips and then headed indoors. I felt that familiar stirring in my slacks and saw that the kitchen door opened a split-second before I had to leave. I went inside a minute later and Cindy was there already. This is the moment of truth or fate I thought to myself. If I can find the right woman, how can I ever live in fear of what is about to happen?</p> <p>The kitchen light flickered on and out onto the backyard. It was still a few hours before dawn. The sky was blue and the sun was shining. It was dark by the time I arrived at my place. Cindy seemed to sense my presence. She pulled me into the large backyard and was about to sit down when I turned and planted a kiss on her. She didn't try to pull away quickly, but her body language told me that she did try. We had an embrace and I felt her breasts pressing against my chest. Her body temperature started rising as our clothes slowly began to move.</p> <p>We kissed for a long time, just letting the passion build. It was not long before her clothing began to fall to the ground. She was still only wearing her panties. "Do you know what I'm wearing?" she asked, as her hand found the elastic of the panties.</p> <p>I just smiled and nodded my head.</p> <p>We continued to kiss and my hands went to her naked waist. As our kiss grew more intense, her hand found mine and she began to slide my slacks down my legs, and finally she gave her hand a squeeze under the table cloth. She broke our kiss and we looked each other in the eye. We began to laugh quietly and then I realized her hand was now on my crotch. The feeling was electric and I was so turned on. I let her take control and we watched each other's tongues dance in our mouths. I was the first to move my hand to the clasp of her bra and she quickly removed it and her breasts came free. They were a magnificent pair of round globes with large dark pink nipples.</p> <p>Cindy's hand reached behind me and the front clasp came loose and we both unhooked the bra, falling to the ground. Our lips continued to explore each other until my hand slid down to the lips of her wet pussy. She let me finger her quickly and felt her own pussy react.</p> <p>We continued to kiss as my hand pressed her hips further into the kiss. Her kisses felt very, very urgent. Our bodies were rubbing against each other with the slightest of movements. My balls were tight and needed release.</p> <p>"Oh, sweetheart," she said, still kissing me. I felt her hand slip down my pants and into my underwear. Her fingers met my cock and she began to rub it through my pants.</p> <p>"Are you ready for more?" I asked, barely containing myself from what I hoped was going to happen.</p> <p>"I'm ready for everything baby. Anything for you," she answered. My fingers pressed her panties to the side of her bald pussy and I rubbed her hard clit with my middle finger. Her whole body began to quiver. I could tell she had been very aroused. I moved my hand down her legs and slipped her panties off her legs. I stood her up and put her bra and panties back on and then stood her up in my arms. I lowered her onto the loveseat and she sat there looking up at me. She started to kiss me, and herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
