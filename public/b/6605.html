What will happen when they get a bunch of money? If it's a good idea, what then?</p> <p>A bit of a headache occurred to me as I sat there wondering what they were going to do now. I didn't think of any of that and just looked after myself, waiting for the right time to start this conversation. My head was pounding so much. I tried not to think about what was going on in my head, which seemed to be causing me to get excited. The pain, the fear, the stress, it was taking me places I had never thought the whole story could go. I tried to stay calm as this all unfolded, hoping to somehow stop it or at the very least feel some sort of relief, but it just didn't work. I tried to be quiet and let what I felt be the good sense of my situation and just enjoy the experience.</p> <p>"What am I supposed to be doing in this place?" I thought to myself as, not feeling a thing I tried to clear my head again, I walked up to the bar and scanned the menu through.</p> <p>"I don't need this", I thought to myself. "It's a mistake."</p> <p>I walked back around the table and was feeling no pain anymore. I was starting to feel at ease and a bit more of what had been a nightmare coming on. I looked over and there was no one in the room, why would I do that? I walked back through the food and started to eat off of the counter and I wondered what they were going to think as I began feeling my eyes beginning to swell. I didn't even notice the guy standing outside my chair trying to talk to me, but now it was my turn to be uncomfortable. I was feeling much better, but not as good, that's for damn sure. My mind was going a little crazy, feeling so much pain, but I kept looking over at the person trying to talk to me and just saw that she looked like she was trying to get past me or maybe she might be able to explain it.</p> <p>I looked again at the name and I recognized this same person standing out on the other end.</p> <p>"Hi there, do you have a name?" she asked. I didn't hear a response, but she did.</p> <p>"Are you the owner?"</p> <p>"Yes, I'm the owner of the place."</p> <p>"Oh my god, you are the owner of the bar. It's my home now!"</p> <p>"That it is. It's a beautiful bar."</p> <p>"Nice, how long have you been there?"</p> <p>"Years."</p> <p>"Wow, wow. I mean...I hope I can get this over with soon. And please, please don't tell my husband, he would kill me if he found out, please."</p> <p>"What a fool!" She said to me, as if it was very simple she wanted to see if her voice sounded better.</p> <p>"That is how it would be." I said. "Now if I'm really lucky, there will be something else for me here. I think so, I wouldn't want something that won't be hard work or pain to do, you know."</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess I could let you," she replied, "but please, just keep on going in the spirit, please."</p> <p>I felt my heart beat at a million miles per hour, just out of my chest. I didn't know what else to say to her but I could only walk out of here with her, and as I stood there with that empty feeling that I had, I began to feel worse, feeling better. My mind was racing as if I was going to take a hit out of one of these pills or something, or anything. My stomach felt like it hurt like hell, and my face was beginning to feel like the room would spin around if I didn't stop. I tried to focus as my fear began to get worse, but at least I knew I couldn't go out like it was yesterday and see how it feels. I felt horrible and at the same time as I began looking over at the other people in the other room and I tried to look at what I was about to see. I felt so ashamed and ashamed at how my eyes were beginning to darken up. I stopped trying to look at the person in the bar, instead trying to look into her eyes and to see what happened.</p> <p>"It's over there.", a voice inside my head came to me, and I looked over more, and saw the person that I wanted to see right there.</p> <p>"Hey." she said as I could feel the tears begin to start in my eyes, " I'm sorry I don't mean to startle you"</p> <p>"It's alright." was all I could manage to sayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
