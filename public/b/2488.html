Please take me back to the boat. Let's take this ship back to shore."</p> <p>With that, he grabbed his things and helped me out of the car. As we walked, he reached out taking my hand and led me into the house. Once inside, the lights came on to the living room.</p> <p>"Would you care for a glass of wine?" he asked.</p> <p>"A glass?" I queried. "Sure, but can I have some wine right now?"</p> <p>I could feel both my mind and body wanting to go back to bed. "I don't know," I answered. "There won't be any."</p> <p>He smiled and pulled me into his arms. He took my head and kissed me gently, his tongue running over my lips. He began to trail his hand up my neck, sliding it between my breasts and down my stomach to rest on my mound. At first I wasn't sure how he would feel about this. With one smooth movement, he rubbed it gently through the soft fabric of my nightgown, pushing it aside to get inside. He ran his tongue along the seam that made up the crease of my ass and finally, he slid it up to my lips and I opened them willingly.</p> <p>His mouth opened quickly and our tongues danced inside. His hands continued to explore me, finding the buttons to my nightgown and unbuttoning them before slipping inside and under the front of my nightgown and rubbing over my nipples. This was turning me on like nothing else. My nipple rose and hardened under his ministrations.</p> <p>He pulled his mouth from mine and sat up. "Wine?" he asked, "Wine for me?" I nodded. He stood up and removed his shirt as I reached down and undid his jeans. I pushed them down over his hips and stepped out of them when he stepped out of them. His cock was already hard and straining against the material of his boxers. With my eyes on his he grabbed the waistline and tugged it down, freeing his throbbing member, his swollen head emerging from its boxers, his shaft glistening with the soft wax of his pre-come. I took that as my cue to step down and sit down, as I turned to face him.</p> <p>"Have you ever had a woman touch you there?" I asked him, "Feel how warm and wet, and wet she is?"</p> <p>He laughed, "No, only you."</p> <p>I leaned forward and kissed his chest. I slid my hands softly down across his chest, across his belly and finally to where his cock was straining against his waist. When I reached the top, I looked up at him and asked, "How about this here?" I leaned forward and licked his cock through the thin fabric of the boxers and then stood up and slid them off.</p> <p>"I'd love to do that again," I replied as I straddled him, guiding his cock into me. The sensation was just as I'd imagined. I rocked my hips on his cock, grinding it deep inside, feeling it slide between my cunt lips. I held his shoulders and he put a hand on my thigh and held me steady while we made love.</p> <p>"I've got an idea," he whispered. I knew what he wanted, and quickly got off him. "Stand up," he said, "sit on the edge of the couch." That is usually not what he wants, but I was so turned on by his story that I quickly got myself together. I stood beside the couch and he took some rope from the kitchen. I laid back and he began to tie me up, first one ankle, then the next with the rope. As he wound up, I began to writhe as he tied my legs to the couch's arm. I looked up at him and saw him looking at me with a smile in his eyes as he put a blind fold on me.</p> <p>"Let's see if this works. Turn around and lay on your back on the couch, legs spread, head propped on pillows, eyes closed." He sat down on the chair and I lay face down on the couch. My face had the feel of the soft leather. He started to tie my ankles and hands, and my legs began to stretch out towards me. When he was done, he stood up, walked around me and fastened the blindfold around my eyes. "Turn over," he said. I complied, not giving him the option of doing what he wanted. His hands roamed over my body, from the curve of my ass, and over my thighs, up until they were just above my cunt. I was sure he wouldn't want to let his fingers venture there either, not when he'd be in a better mood.</p> <p>Before he had the blindfoldâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
