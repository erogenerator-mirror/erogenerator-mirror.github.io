His belt came next next.</p> <p>"No," she said, "I don't want to feel you inside me. You are too big."</p> <p>He was not going to argue. He positioned himself with his hips just below her pussy so that she could feel every inch of him. Her pussy was so tight around him, she could feel every throbbing length of his penis, every vein, every ridge on his skin. She felt every inch of him, the heat and strength of his muscles, the hardness of his cock, the strength of his hands as he touched her skin. He began a slow, deep, rhythmic motion with his hips, just barely pushing her hips upward as he penetrated her with his cock. He began taking more control of himself as he thrust forward, his hand coming to rest on the tightest breast he'd ever felt. His hips moved very slowly, just the tip of his cock still inside her, savoring the feel of her tight pussy. He reached for the bottom of the bed, and raised her legs up onto his shoulders, putting her legs in his strong hands. He then thrust again, just the tip of his penis pushing her open, just the tip, just the tip, until he felt her start to move, then pull outward, again and again, until he felt his cock head touch her cervix and then slide back down into the depths of her pussy.</p> <p>"Oh, Sam, I've waited so long," she moaned. "I've missed you so much."</p> <p>He held her close to him, his eyes closed as he reached his arms over her to grab hold of her breasts. His mouth on hers again and again, taking the wet trail of her saliva that had already developed between them, moving to her neck and chest. One hand roamed all over her body as he kissed her. Feeling the hard little nubs of her nipples on his palms, feeling his fingers run up until they found their way around them, feeling the soft, almost impervious skin that was now fully engorged, and beginning to tingle. He ran his hands over her breasts, feeling himself slide inside her tight channel, filling her completely and then just as she thought he was going to slide all the way out, he slid completely back in, then again. He could feel the pressure of her opening around his cock, the pressure of her cervix as he pushed in. She began moving her hips back and forth, just a little, in sync with his movements as he pushed his cock in, then pulled back, then thrust in, faster, harder. She knew that this was good - her first time being fucked. Her vagina was so tight around him that the difference was almost indescribable. The head of his cock sliding in and out of her, the feeling of her wet pussy clenching his cock in a soft, tight, slippery vise. His fingers had started rubbing her nipples - the tips of his fingers playing with them.</p> <p>"Please, Sam, please, I want you..."</p> <p>Sam pushed her hips down on his, taking his cock as far as she could take it before pulling her hips downward. He held himself still, looking into her eyes, holding himself as long as he could before she asked him to get down on the bed. He did, and lay her back on the bed, her skirt and panties gone, her feet dangling down, the tops of her heels touching the floor. His face hovering over hers, his tongue licking gently at her lips, his hand grasping her breast so he could pull her back toward him. She looked into his eyes.</p> <p>"I've been longing to have you inside me. I could feel you inside of me. I want to feel you against me. Can we go on like this."</p> <p>Sam was beginning to lose his control as he slid his tongue between her lips and pressed her pussy to the base of his cock that still was buried deep inside her. She tasted as good as she looked. His mouth opened, seeking her mouth as she opened herself to him. She felt his breath on the side of her neck. His tongue licked her throat. She moaned as his tongue licked the spot just under her jaw.</p> <p>Sam slid himself out and lay next to her. She could feel the warmth of his body pressing against her, his arms holding her close to his chest. She loved the feel of him there, the feeling as she felt him, as she held on to him. She could feel her breasts rising and falling as he lay on top of her. She could feel the rise and fall of his hips against hers. He kissed her neck and her ears, her cheek, her mouth, her neck and then her lips. She opened her mouth to him and tasted the salt of his mouth on her lips. Again, a soft caressâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
