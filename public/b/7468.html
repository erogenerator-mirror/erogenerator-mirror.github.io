I'm sure he's going to find this one easy.</p> <p>I'm just happy I found our little treasure. Maybe I can find something in this. I can't.</p> <p>We finish up in a few minutes and I go back out into the bedroom.</p> <p>They both get right to it. As soon as we're both in place, Jim gets down on his knees. He picks me up off the bed and drops me down on his face. I think he's started and will take me to town until he can get his tongue over my clit.</p> <p>It gets me going again and I start to buck my hips as he keeps his tongue in place. Soon, I feel him pull my lips apart and then he's sliding his tongue over my entire slit again. He knows exactly how to touch me. It feels amazing. He's doing a good job at what he believes is good for me. I don't know where it got from. I feel him sliding his mouth up and down the top three inches of my slit, up my hole.</p> <p>By the time he gets to the tip I'm nearly gone and start to scream. We hear the other guy let out a long sigh of joy. I hear Jim get up.</p> <p>I think we're going to be spending the night with them. I guess we all have our own plans tonightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
