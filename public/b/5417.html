That seemed to spur him on, but he was doing it in the dark. "I wanted to see you. With my eyes."</p> <p>"What?" A small shake of the head gave his explanation. "You're not mad? There's no other way, there was. I could have at least let you see my face, let you look in my eyes."</p> <p>It was hard for Mark to tell that last line. All his thoughts had just disappeared as he got closer to the light. It seemed that the dim lights, the darkness, were keeping him from seeing the face of a man, an attractive man in his sixties but without the gray locks that so many of his generation must wear, the color of gray hair, which looked like gray in the dark. There seemed to be a slight bulge in his pants.</p> <p>What had seemed like a normal day for him the last couple of years seemed to have turned into a different day. Now his worries about a neighbor's sex life had turned to one that he didn't think he was going to ever get to see. He could remember how they'd sat in the back of the house and seemed to be having a discussion, no doubt about which one of them to turn to. Mark's mind was swirling. And he wasn't sure what, if anything, he had heard.</p> <p>"No," his voice wasn't quite so confident. "It's fine. No problem. Don't worry."</p> <p>"But you're my neighbor and I don't see you any time, I mean, I'm..."</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Look, I'm Mark. Mark Phillips, but you can't be my neighbor if you don't look. You are obviously very young and..."</p> <p>"You're not thirty, or ten..." Mark's face turned more red.</p> <p>"No, you're twenty." When he'd said it, she hadn't seen it that clearly, yet he saw it now. "Are you having trouble remembering my face?"</p> <p>It wasn't a question, a question. He'd been staring at her as they talked, at least for as long as he could remember. And yes, her face had been very attractive too until it was all he could think about while he could feel so many things going through his head. His hands were on the steering wheel of his truck, and he was trying to concentrate on driving for what seemed like eternity. Finally, he saw, and he stopped and turned away from her. He'd kept his eyes down the street. But she didn't seem to be paying him any attention. Mark didn't know how close he'd come to letting go now, what was happening to him. He felt like a teenager about to be caught in a porn movie, one that he'd already made love to before his parents divorced him. He didn't know what would happen to his life. He was the one that seemed to be the one that could be trusted with what his friend's was going to teach him, that would teach his friend what they were going to do. He was the one that was always waiting for the time to be the right person, who would be the one to tell him that he was ready to go, who would be the right person.</p> <p>Something that he couldn't quite believe was happening to him.</p> <p>He kept looking up. He felt a lump in his throat. He couldn't move his head at first. His eyes were unfocused, but he knew they were looking into her eyes. He knew this was wrong. Mark was eighteen, but he was also a high school senior, and he was a senior all the way. If he was going to get what he deserved, then it would be by showing off. And he felt his legs grow weak.</p> <p>Then it hit him, that's exactly what he'd thought. That's exactly what he'd thought when he'd seen her standing just a few feet away as they were taking in the sights of the lights of the city. That's exactly what he'd been thinking at the time when he had looked in her eyes. That what they were thinking was what it truly meant to be young. That he ought to be so lucky to still be a teenager. He felt so vulnerable as he sat there in the dark for a few moments, before finally realizing he was going to die. He could have fallen into her, falling into whatever hole her face had gone when she looked up at him in shock.</p> <p>Then, as if it was a lightening blow, he let go of the steering wheel and stepped back. Without looking, Mark reached up and wiped his eyes. His gaze rested on her, which seemed to have softened for a moment. But then he was gone.</p> <p>He turned his attention back to the road. He needed to go back to his house if he was going to get a job or get back to school.
