His erection was fully engorged. He felt the thick length brush against his leg while she reached back and slid her fingers into her slit, rubbing her lips. He looked at her body as she ran her fingers through her damp hair. His eyes followed her finger movements as more and more of her wetness coated her fingers. His eyes were fixed on her pussy as she pushed a finger up her hole. He could hear her moaning as she moved a finger in and out of her tight hole. He continued to stare into her eyes as he leaned closer.</p> <p>Kathy was nearing her climax, her breasts rising and falling quickly. As she was about to climax, she heard a knock at the door.</p> <p>"Oh I hear that it's for the bell," said Mark. He laughed and turned to give the visitor his address.</p> <p>"Hi" he said as he kissed Kathy deeply.</p> <p>"Hi. I was going to come up and see if you were ready for me," she said as she pulled back from him.</p> <p>He smiled and returned her kiss.</p> <p>They broke the kiss with a kiss, and Mark laughed. He pulled her in close, his hands roaming all over her body. Her mouth met his in a soft passionate kiss. His fingers gently found her breast as his mouth met her soft lips. His mouth pulled away from hers.</p> <p>Kathy opened her eyes and looked at him then back at the door.</p> <p>"I have another surprise for you," she said as her eyes searched his.</p> <p>"Oh?" he replied as he dropped his pants and underwear to his ankles.</p> <p>He stepped out of them and tossed them aside then lay down on his back with his cock at the perfect height.</p> <p>"Fuck me," she said as she pushed him against the edge of the mat. "I want you inside."</p> <p>He did not need a second invitation. As she straddled him, she grabbed his hard cock and slipped it into her. His cock entered her body with no guidance. Not really knowing what to do, Kathy took a few deep breaths before placing her feet on the mat. She leaned forward, resting her hands at his shoulders, as she began to roll her hips into his. Her breath began to come in gasps.</p> <p>Both of them watched her as her head arched back, while her breasts thrust out.</p> <p>"My God," he whispered as his hips began to move up and down.</p> <p>He couldn't believe how hot and wet she was. She felt amazing as she slid against him. She felt a warm glow as her body became more sensitive.</p> <p>After a couple minutes, Kathy got up off Tom and stood on the mat. She grabbed his cock gently, guiding it towards her opening. The head penetrated her lips with just the head.</p> <p>"Oh, God. I'm so sorry. Please don't" she begged Tom.</p> <p>"I need to move inside you," he replied.</p> <p>Tom's cock was already beginning to enter her.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want this?" Tom asked. "I can stop any time."</p> <p>"God yes. Please keep it in me. I'm on the pill!"</p> <p>Tom could feel her body relax. "You want it now?"</p> <p>"Yes," she whispered. She put her hands down flat against her chest while slowly sliding his cock further into her body. "Push up and give me that beautiful fucker," she cooed as she began to inch the head of his cock into her soft hole.</p> <p>Slowly, they began to move together. When their bodies touched, one of Kathy's legs was over Tom's hips. She was thrusting her pelvis up.</p> <p>Tom could feel his cock head pushing against her walls. He felt her wetness on his body, feeling the cool sensation of her. Her lips were now wet with her juices. Tom could see the lustful look of pleasure on her face as she slid her body onto him. He began to slide in and out of her slowly, allowing Tom to get used to her warm tight hole.</p> <p>Kathy's mind was in fantasy. She was being taken, her pussy wanted it, her mind had been lost, and now she was being taken by a man. She could feel the head of Tom's cock pressing against her cervix. The feeling was so intense. It caused her to throw her head back and arch her body. The look on her face told him that she was experiencing sensations she had never felt before. Her body was reacting to it and it sent waves of pleasure through her.</p> <p>"I need to come," she said and pulled away from him.</p> <p>"Do you want me to wait?" Tom asked.</p> <p>"No, please, I want it now," sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
