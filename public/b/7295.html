She held up a small silver box, and said in a soft voice. "Do you have these? Oh, I thought maybe you'd like the one with the silver in the middle of your name."</p> <p>It was time to take the new picture of me. It was definitely a new one with the new name printed on it. I opened the box and saw a beautiful set of pictures of a beautiful woman lying naked on a bed with her legs spread and a man kneeling between them as they played with her breasts. I found the picture I wanted in the box and took several more pictures of me, as I tried to decide. The man in the picture had his mouth wrapped around a nipple and the woman had one hand rubbing the other side of his blonde hair while he licked her slit.</p> <p>"I bought this when I was just going over to visit this guy at the mall. I was hoping that you'd like it. Would you like them with me?" she asked with a smile.</p> <p>"Sure, why not," I answered, as I sat the box down and picked up the picture, and tried to focus on the picture of me. The woman who had taken the picture looked to be about my age, who I guessed was in her early thirties. A little older, I thought, but who she was obviously looking for. As I picked up the picture from the wall, she leaned over and whispered something into the man's ear. He responded by reaching out and grabbing her breasts. I noticed he had a little tent in his pants.</p> <p>After a couple more minutes, the woman stood up and walked towards the bathroom. She returned holding a small bag. She told me to get up in there and go get her something to wear. She looked down at the man's face as he sat there and turned to me with a grin.</p> <p>"I've got a little something for you tomorrow," she said. "Are you interested in doing two more pictures?" I was looking at the picture of me now.</p> <p>"Yes," I answered. "This one will do."</p> <p>"Ok, it's good. When do you think you'll have the pictures taken?"</p> <p>"I already took them tomorrow," I answered. "Do you have time for another visit?" I asked.</p> <p>"Nope," she said, with a sly smile.</p> <p>After making up her mind, she walked back over to stand beside me. I reached out and touched a breast as my mind wandered by my actions. She leaned over and gave me a peck on the cheek.</p> <p>"This is the perfect opportunity, is it?" she asked with a grin. "You'll have the opportunity for what you'll do. Do you remember what I mentioned? I don't have anything else, just a few pictures that I think you might enjoy."</p> <p>I reached up and took the bag from her hand. Looking at the picture in the bag, I felt a shiver down my arm. I felt a strange sense of nervousness. I knew I had no idea where my future would lead, and I felt a tingling sensation down my neck as I opened the bag to read the picture.</p> <p>The picture was of me on one of the bed. As I opened the bag, I felt myself getting aroused as I looked at the woman lying naked on the bed. She was beautiful. She had a lovely chest, and that's where the picture came into focus. She was beautiful. The woman looked to be in her early to late fifties, with a trim, shapely body that could have come from the gym. Her breasts were full and inviting to my eyes. Her nipples were small, very pink, and looked really hard as they pressed against her body.</p> <p>She had a sexy, innocent smile on her face as she was lying there. I watched the woman move forward and look down on the next picture, which was of her looking down on and looking at herself. I wanted to stroke my hands down across her body, but I didn't have any picture with me yet. I looked at the picture again. And again.</p> <p>I wasn't sure what she had in mind. I thought that maybe I could just see her as I had seen her in the past. But again, I had no idea where she had come up with the idea, because I hadn't read the picture of me. I was too busy looking around the room for answers.</p> <p>Finally deciding that I could handle it, I closed the bag and left for the restroom, as the images suddenly stopped.</p> <p>"You're going to have to get a pair of panties, aren't you?" she said with a big grin as I was walking by.
