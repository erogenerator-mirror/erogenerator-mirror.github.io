Her eyes locked to the glass wall as she spoke. It was hard for him to believe his ears might have not been tuned out.</p> <p>"It's been a long and hard day. My parents took over one of the stores at home when they got ahold of me. I am on my own now, but I have a friend that owns a small shop that is in the back, and I am hoping to start there." He was afraid he may have been reading too much into her reaction, but he needed to be sure his ears listened to her.</p> <p>The store assistant handed him a key and asked if he'd come in. As he walked in, he could smell the coffee brewing and the scent was getting stronger.</p> <p>'It's a good place to start.' His mind jumped.</p> <p>'And...you're here for a while. What about you?' His mind jumped around the conversation the woman had with him.</p> <p>"Yeah. I have a friend that owns a shop in town a town over," she said, indicating the shop.</p> <p>"Is he as good as you are? Would the other two guys be in trouble?" He had a feeling he knew the answer to that one.</p> <p>"I don't think they'd be in trouble. They would do as I say anyway. Just watch." His hand waved from the counter.</p> <p>"I wouldn't want anyone to be in trouble when I told them to wait." He was nervous to meet her again.</p> <p>'It can't be that bad.' He thought, and his heart began to race.</p> <p>"Please call me Sam. That's more comfortable now. My name is Sam and I work the front desk and do what I can to have an opportunity to meet you again." Her voice had a husky tone and his heart raced. "What a surprise. I thought you'd want to see me again."</p> <p>"I certainly do!" He hugged her tightly.</p> <p>'I like that I am getting to know you. It makes things so much easier.' 'This is one nice piece of news, Sam.' Her arm brushed his as she spoke.</p> <p>"Please don't be surprised if I get to see you again. It is a bit of a shame I am staying in, but you did the right thing."</p> <p>'Thank you Sam. I couldn't really refuse. I haven't really done this in a while.'</p> <p>"I want you to meet my friend here and maybe see him for himself sometime. He was asking for a friend of mine and he wanted to meet me." Sam looked at the small counter. 'A friend? Like you?'</p> <p>'I'm not sure. Why didn't you just tell me he was waiting outside?' His cheeks burned again.</p> <p>"I wasn't sure what to do. It is easier to talk to people. I could do this myself. I have never been in a store like this before and I think I might like it. I like meeting other people. I think you would too.' Her face had turned more red.</p> <p>'What...what are you talking about?'</p> <p>'I am glad it is finally here. Just sit down and I'll get you started.' She handed him the key.</p> <p>'Thanks.' Sam reached for his wallet and opened the bag with the key inside. The key he had given her earlier was still on the counter. It was a bit small, but at the same time it took the whole bag up into the back. He took the keys and headed outside. He hoped she would like it.</p> <p>He was surprised at his luck. Sam had just shown him that she had a friend that was buying lingerie. He looked at the store and his head was filled with thoughts of her. He was nervous. His hands trembled as he walked to the front counter.</p> <p>'Maybe I should have been more professional!' He thought as he looked into every face that came into view.</p> <p>He pulled his wallet from his pocket and quickly handed it to her.</p> <p>"Sam! That's a surprise!" She looked at him with wide eyes.</p> <p>He looked at her and smiled. "How is something so wonderful to be here? I told you everything would be so perfect." Her eyes flicked to the bulge in his trousers.</p> <p>"I don't know how I expected it. This is really wonderful!" Her smile was dazzling as she spoke.</p> <p>'I love your smile. It helps me get out all those doubts.' Sam's mind was racing. It was obvious he wanted her to ask for him, but it was hard to get past the butterflies in his stomach.</p> <p>"Thank you. It is a very good treat.
