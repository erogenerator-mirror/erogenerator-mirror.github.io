Yes!"</p> <p>"Please be gentle! Take the plunge!"</p> <p>I could hear my heart, pounding out of my chest in a heartbeat!</p> <p>"No!" I shouted, and in my most dominant voice, I added, "I will only be a fraction over a minute! Please! Please! I beg you!"</p> <p>With that, I turned around to have my head on a wall and my back bent in a 90 degree angle so that my breasts were high in the air and on the back of my desk. My fingers were under my left arm, supporting my weight while my chest was pressed into the carpet. My legs were spread to allow me maximum range to walk. I kept my knees in the most flexible position...my right hand was gripping the edge of the desk, my left arm wrapped around my left hip and left foot pressed firmly against the floor. The only thing that made my feet move independently of the desk, were the fingers on each side of my pussy, which felt wonderful to touch.</p> <p>My legs were locked on the wall by my hips, my toes extended. I needed the movement to move the foot in front, so I was looking forward. I started to stroke myself to hardness which is usually impossible to achieve if you're not on the phone with your partner. I could hear my breathing getting heavier. I was in the middle of my third round of orgasms; which, with just the thought of that one, is enough to send me right over to oblivion. My legs were tired from being closed around the carpet. My left leg was lying flat on the desk with its right foot resting on the floor.</p> <p>"Please! Please! I am ready now!"</p> <p>My voice came out a strangled whisper as I started stroking slowly, getting closer to the top and starting my descent. My hips were moving towards me. I wanted to reach the climax of the night, which was now coming...</p> <p>"Please! Please!" I whispered in a husky voice, "Please fuck me! Ohhhhhhhh!"</p> <p>My back was pressed against the wall of the office. My shoulders and upper back were resting perfectly on my calves. In the middle of the desk, I reached up to my right, while my left hand was at the top of the desk with my entire left leg bent at the knee. My eyes were closed, but I could see by the movement of my lips that my lips were moving in slow motion. I held myself down for a long time; when I felt that I was about to burst, I relaxed my legs and slowly, I turned my head to look at the clock on my desk. Only a minute was left to enjoy while my breathing had slowed. I looked at my back...my hair was a bit tangled. My breasts were not much to go on, but I noticed that they were moving with the movement of my breaths, in rhythm with my body.</p> <p>This was the height that it would be impossible for me to hold back on my orgasm, which might be too much. I closed my eyes shut to enjoy the pleasure.</p> <p>"Oh honey!" I purred, enjoying every second of my moment. "Do you want me to have an orgasm here?"</p> <p>My fingers started digging into the carpet to find purchase on the floor.</p> <p>"Yes! Oh, yes!!! Yes! Right there!"</p> <p>After a few seconds, I started to slide my right leg down on the floor, but the left leg fell back on the carpeted floor. The right leg and left one had a pillow on top. My skirt was up around my back and everything on that part of the desk was still. I was still lying down on my back with my head to the right- foot to the center, while my right foot supported the left. I wanted to continue on...but my legs wouldn't work. I pulled my right foot towards me and I leaned my left over. My legs were now lying with my right knee and the left one facing towards the door. I could still see the clock on my desk.</p> <p>"Oh! It is already 7! It is late for me!" I said to my heart in a loud whisper.</p> <p>"Do you want me to help you get undressed?"</p> <p>"Yes! Yes! Yes!" I said, "Please! Donna! Please...do something!"</p> <p>"What kind of stuff is you on about, hon?"</p> <p>I was not completely sure what to say. All I knew is that the sound of my voice sounded funny, like in my old, terrible, Hollywood movies.</p> <p>"No, it is nothing, darling! I will just do it with you! Please!"</p> <p>"But you can't do it with me!"</p> <p>"Oh I can! I have to! I have toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
