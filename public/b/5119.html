I think I'm going to have a very wet, beautiful lady here this weekend," I teased with a smile.</p> <p>I don't know if she saw my glance or not, but she smiled and nodded and then kissed me again right in my mouth. For a moment I was too shocked to do anything but return the kiss, while I reached down to her ass and squeezed, hard.</p> <p>"I'm gonna try and stop you, but it feels too good!" she smiled.</p> <p>"Do you remember how to tell me what to do?" I asked.</p> <p>"I do," she said and I felt her finger press into the crease of my ass and I was pushed against the bed with it.</p> <p>"There's the first word," I said and she went down on me, using two fingers to tease my ass while giving me a mouth-to-mouth fuck. When she got to the part where I was just holding her back in my arms, she rolled over on top of me and slowly lowered herself down onto mine, both of us moaning and sighing as we continued.</p> <p>"Oh God, yes!" she moaned, and I could feel my cock start to stiffen and jump up and down when she had her way with me.</p> <p>"I love you," she murmured, and then we were gone, making love that night and I had to tell her to stop. I could only tell when I came in her pussy and felt everything in my balls go out of my cock, the first time I had taken so long to cum I'd lost count.</p> <p>"That was...that's okay. Now I want to watch," she cooed, and went off to her own bed. She had already had an idea on how to stop things, so we could finish our story later as we had planned on.</p> <p>I still couldn't believe she had been so forceful and forceful with me when we were alone that first night. I'd been a virgin and I'd told her the way I felt about it, but she had already felt my cock so when she got it hard inside her, that night she seemed to forget.</p> <p>"Did you really take all that? Or was I just a little..." she laughed a little and then shook her head. "Don't be silly."</p> <p>I laughed with her.</p> <p>We didn't talk about it anymore, only how I was a big fan of her music, and especially how I could relate to being a fan of her and liking her music when she talked about my music and dancing. We didn't need our glasses to know it'd be my music.</p> <p>"It's amazing..." she said after our kiss and we both turned back to the main part of the conversation.</p> <p>"And I love you," I said.</p> <p>She kissed me again and I didn't understand, but I told her.</p> <p>"I love you," I said, and then we were walking again and making love as we did on the first date of our new friendship.</p> <p>To the very end of the evening, all I remembered was how she had asked me if I wanted to have my first kiss at the end of our new friendship or if I wanted to sleep with her again. I did neither, because I didn't want to take that first kiss that night again. We were both embarrassed and I wasn't happy about it, but we were friends and we didn't need to keep going.</p> <p>That date ended well.</p> <p>We were living together again and had not had any sex.</p> <p>"Are you still okay with the way I've treated you?" she asked.</p> <p>"I am, but you shouldn't call you that! It's disrespectful to you to make me feel that way and it's not because I've been disrespectful, or even a little ashamed," I said.</p> <p>"That was very flattering, didn't it?" She said.</p> <p>"Absolutely!" I agreed.</p> <p>"I thought I might see you again," she said as we embraced one last time and I felt the same thing with her.</p> <p>We didn't see each other that summer when it was my turn to stay with my aunt's aunt. We had moved to a place near the end of our lives when we were very young, and we didn't know how to act around her.</p> <p>On the end of July my family took over the home. I had worked as a gardener and was one of several students working on the house. There was a family wedding later in the month and we had no idea who had brought the flowers and where they were. We had only seen each other once or twice in the first two days I moved in, and I was never alone with my aunt.</p> <p>When theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
