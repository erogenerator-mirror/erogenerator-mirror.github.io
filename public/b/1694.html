It wasn't quite a threat, but there was no doubt in my mind she expected me to do the same. A sly smile was planted on her lips once again and she lifted her hand, giving it to me. I felt the soft, warm fingers slide up my thigh, making my body shiver a little. Her hand was in my coat now, pressing, stroking, caressing my flesh and I felt my body wanting her. I lifted my eyes to watch her hand again, and caught a quick glimpse of her hand, the finger was now dipping between her lips, up her thighs to stroke her moist slit.</p> <p>The feeling was indescribably powerful and I could feel the dampness of her fingers on my thigh. Her finger traced the outlines of my slit and when she saw my eyes follow, then lower, to her hand, her finger followed the outline of my lips, sliding between them, opening her up to me. As I watched her hand glide up my thigh, a soft, almost childlike sigh, she gave a little shudder. The little gasp and the quiver in her shoulders told me she approved. I watched mesmerized as her hand cupped my sex, feeling the flesh, pulling it open with a little more pressure. My eyes closed again when she started to touch me, her tongue lightly licking at my outer lips as they opened. I opened my legs wider and allowed her access. Slowly she slid another finger, opening me to her.</p> <p>"Wow," I heard myself say as she slid her other hand, one finger at a time, in and out past the second knuckle.</p> <p>"It's okay. It's not all weird to you," she said, her voice barely louder than the breath that now escaped her.</p> <p>My thoughts were on fire, my body was on sensory overload as my body became more and more alive. And as she fingered me, I started to buck my hips up in the seat. When I thought I could handle it no more, I had to reach back and put my arms around her neck.</p> <p>"Ohhh!" I thought to myself as my hips thrust forward and up against her hand. I was so aroused as I felt her fingers slip into me, opening me, spreading me. When she found that spot that sent me to the point of no return, when I wanted to stop it, I could tell she knew.</p> <p>"Ooooooh!" I screamed, but to no avail. This woman's fingers were going to find my inner walls, my outer lips, touching them. "Oh, god! I can't hold it anymore!"</p> <p>"That's the idea," she said as she rolled her fingers in my slit, then pushed her fingers into my vagina. Her other hand was holding my breast, the other hand was caressing the inside of my thigh as she fingered me, her palm covered in my juices.</p> <p>"I'd like to put it in my own mouth, but, I have to tell you, I don't want a tongue up here tonight."</p> <p>"No?" she asked, sliding her fingers all the way out and pulling my clitoral hood back. I could see the pink tissue opening up like a flower inside as she slid another finger in, pushing my inner lips open. Her fingers were in me now as she started to work them into me with her hand, pulling them out, then returning again.</p> <p>"Yeah, but the first time is okay," she said, her voice breathy but a little bit dreamy. I could feel my pussy beginning to stretch when her fingers left my opening. She repeated the action, sliding in, pulling it out as she slid away. My clitoris was hard and swollen, which surprised me, but also added more to the sensation. Her fingers were wet with my juices as she pulled them out, then slid in again, the lips of my vagina opened a little as she slid them back in and out.</p> <p>I couldn't hold it any longer, my hips started to thrust wildly forward as I felt her fingers start that motion again. Just as she let go, I looked over my shoulder to see her in the mirror. I saw her tongue, which had a thin, almost white line on it, running down and over it, a small part of her cheek glistening. I saw her tongue come up into front of her face, then take the side of her fingers, and slowly pull them out and back, as if she was removing them from me. I watched her tongue make the motions again, then she smiled a little.</p> <p>"You did."</p> <p>"And I'll do the same for you," I laughed.</p> <p>"You're a bad, bad girl," she replied. "Can I lick?"</p> <p>'Oh I'm really going to have to try it," I thought toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
