My ex did a good job with you." I said.</p> <p>"Thank you." He said.</p> <p>"I'm pretty sure you two fucked in front of him." I said.</p> <p>He chuckled but then looked at her again. "Is that what you wanted to see me say?" He asked.</p> <p>She smiled slightly, then shook her head. "What?" She asked.</p> <p>He shrugged. "Nothing. I just know he is a little kinky, and I always do try to have fun with my ex." He explained. "So if you want to come back to my place with me and I will let you if you can let him join us again, I would be happy." He said.</p> <p>"I'd be happy, and I can just live with it no strings." She said happily.</p> <p>"I know, the way I am with all my ex's, no pressure." He assured her as he took one last look at his wife. "You look great." He said as he turned to leave.</p> <p>"Are you always this nice?" She asked as he stopped in his tracks.</p> <p>"Always nice." He answered.</p> <p>"Don't worry." She smiled as she walked back to the bedroom as he went.</p> <p>"You have nothing to worry about, because there might be others willing to join us." He stated.</p> <p>"Yes, there is, especially with you." She told him.</p> <p>"Yeah." He smiled back at her.</p> <p>She started to say something to him as they kissed again.</p> <p>"You don't have to keep making a fuss about it honey, we don't have to go out to eat tonight, it's just for us both." He assured her.</p> <p>"Really, don't worry about that silly, we will just have to wait until tomorrow, so no worries." She assured him.</p> <p>"I like being in control, even more than before though I didn't plan at first for this. We always seem to be like little kids now." He said.</p> <p>"Just remember that you said that I was in control." She said.</p> <p>"I just think that it is hard because once you start to be more dominant, everything is easier to follow." He told her.</p> <p>"Mmm, that is a good point, but let's get back to the party. I am ready to have a good time, and hopefully a good night." She said.</p> <p>"If you say so mom." Mark said as he turned his wife back to face him.</p> <p>"Come over and I'll make sure you make up for your little mistake." She grinned as she pulled him down to the bed with her.</p> <p>He was already naked and she knew it, as soon as her naked body was in his arms. He immediately fell to her and pushed his tongue into her mouth.</p> <p>As she moaned with passion, she wrapped her tongue around his and moaned a long, low, loud moan.</p> <p>"Mmm, yes baby, do that again. Oh god yes." She moaned as she felt his cock against her bare leg.</p> <p>He held his wife's hips and pushed down, taking her right where he wanted to go.</p> <p>"OH god baby, I need it." She whispered, as he pushed into her a couple of more times.</p> <p>As he pushed back into her, he could feel the heat of her body and could sense she was not a virgin. He knew his lover felt the same way, but he wanted her to feel a little better.</p> <p>She could tell by the way she was breathing he was already hard. She had been watching him for the past five years as she had been the one to get him to go out and do all of the things that had him cumming.</p> <p>She knew if he didn't fuck her right now, she would, and could have him right in the bathroom.</p> <p>She pushed his hand away before she lost control and took control of the situation.</p> <p>"Yes, like that." She moaned.</p> <p>She was getting a thrill from just having him back in the room.</p> <p>His hand moved to her face, and grabbed her roughly, pulling her down onto the bed. She kissed him as she rolled over, and they got into a nice sixty nine position as his hands took over as well.</p> <p>It only took a few seconds before he took over where she left off.</p> <p>"OH, FUCK YES! YES! YES."</p> <p>Both of them were moaning and yelling as they got closer and closer to the edgeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
