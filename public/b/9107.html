As I did so, I heard the door open.</p> <p>"Oh, hi," said Marcello. I turned to him and smiled as we watched the young man in the doorway come to a halt at the foot of the bed. Marcello quickly undid his belt, unzipped his fly, and extracted his cock. It was about nine inches long and uncut, which I knew would soon become even thicker as it got longer, I guessed.</p> <p>A slight chill went down the length on the sheet as Marcello knelt over my naked form. His right hand took my hair and pulled, forcing me to look at his glistening cock. I closed my eyes, imagining it sliding in and out of my mouth.</p> <p>"Oh, wow," I suddenly exclaimed, unable to believe what was going on. "I didn't know you did this," I said, somewhat breathlessly.</p> <p>"No problem, I've been fucking women on and off for years," Marcello said. Now that he was naked, he stood and slid his penis into the mouth of my sex again. The boy had a very nice cock; it was not the long hard shafts of a good-looking man, but it would definitely go up to four inches in the flesh, and quite nicely. As Marcello fucked me with long and steady thrusting, I ran my hands over his taught and well-defined back muscles.</p> <p>"Mmmm, fuck, yes", I sighed aloud as he bottomed out against my cervix. I reached down between us to stroke his erection. He fucked me for a few minutes, but soon pulled out and flipped me over onto my back. I reached for the nightstand for a condom.</p> <p>"No! You can't fuck me," I stuttered and nearly shouted.</p> <p>"I'm not that bad," Marcello smirked and stood above me. "I'm an older man, though, and we could have had some fun together.</p> <p>I struggled free of the nightstand, falling to the floor once again. I was momentarily confused by this situation, but it wasn't as bad as I feared; at least the reality was better than the fantasy as it were. I felt Marcello climb aboard, his large body settling into position. His long, thick penis slid along my pussy and found my opening, pushing its way deeper into my body than anything any of the men ever managed to accomplish before. Marcello pressed himself into me and moved. He fucked me slowly, as if I were someplace else. I felt a slight discomfort as his large cock stretched my vagina wide, but I soon settled into a much softer, warm, and erotic rhythm.</p> <p>Marcello began fucking me almost as slowly as he had fucked my mouth once before when he had sucked my clitoris. I soon felt his body tensing and a small amount of semen erupting all over my cervix.</p> <p>"Oh fuck, I'm going to cum," I whispered.</p> <p>Marcello held himself inside me for several more seconds, then pulled back. I had a feeling of total submission as his penis slid out of my pussy. I looked forward at the bed that we had laid down. There were no towels on it. He lifted me up by my hips and laid me back on the bed. I looked at him expectantly, as if to say, "Don't ever tell anybody," then to him back to the ceiling. I wondered what would happen now. Could this be the first time we had done this together, or did he simply want to go all the way?</p> <p>It seemed strange to me that he asked me to do something so dirty. That was probably because I didn't trust myself to talk to him or him to see through my trap. What I really wanted was to have my face buried in a warm body again, to have him enter me again, and to feel the same pleasure as before.</p> <p>"What do you want baby?" I whispered. I didn't know if I had just said that or if I had said that aloud. "Say it."</p> <p>He sat on the bed looking at me and smiling. I smiled. "Tell me what you want," I whispered and kissed him playfully on the lips.</p> <p>"You're a lovely woman," he said.</p> <p>"I love you," I returned and smiled.</p> <p>A long time came and went in the following week before we did any more sexual activities between our parties. We were never really alone together, but both of us kept to our fantasies. This was probably the third time I had had sex with a woman, and I felt guilty for having an affair. The first was two years ago, the second, when I had a sex change operation with a young Hispanic girl who was in theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
