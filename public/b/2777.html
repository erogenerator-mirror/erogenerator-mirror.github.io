That's it, just like in the movie." She did. He reached over and cupped her chin with one hand. He lifted her face slightly, looked deep into her eyes and whispered, "Say my name."</p> <p>"I want you to kiss me," she spoke in all of the right parts of her voice. "I'm so nervous." She nodded yes while rubbing the palm of her hand against his lower face. She kissed him lightly, and he closed his eyes while she made love to them with her eyes.</p> <p>"Do you want me to make love to you, Tessa?" he asked her.</p> <p>"Yes," she breathed back just barely.</p> <p>"No, I want you to take me," he said simply as he put his hand under her shirt. He felt the softness of her soft skin as he held her. He ran his finger across her breast and pulled her closer to him. Tessa trembled and held on to him.</p> <p>Her head turned towards his hand, she could hear his breath, felt it in her bones, and he was smiling.</p> <p>"Did you just hear the word love?" he asked her gently.</p> <p>"Yes, I heard the word," she said as she pulled away to kiss him again, softly.</p> <p>"I am your husband, I swear to you that I have never cheated on your partner or you, for that matter. I am only responsible for your happiness. You are more beautiful as a woman than you know in reality." He cupped her chin and looked her in the eye. He kissed her then as a man would.</p> <p>"I loved your mouth when I was your lover, but my mind and heart were both in a state which was beyond me ability to comprehend." He kissed her forehead and looked her in the eyes.</p> <p>"Do you think this is okay," she asked hopefully. He knew she wanted him to love her back, even if she was afraid that he was taking advantage of her like he did.</p> <p>"No," he said firmly. "I like that. I thought you might hate it if I let you go first. But I'm your husband. I am not going to let you go. Do you really wanna go to my party after all of this? I won't have that problem. Not with how beautiful you are, what a mouth she has," he said as he looked lovingly at her. He kissed her forehead then looked her in the eye again.</p> <p>"Do what you're doing," she reminded him. The look he got in her eyes when he told her how gorgeous she was that made him feel that kind of warmth inside.</p> <p>"Do I look like a man to you?" he asked her.</p> <p>"You do," she nodded.</p> <p>"Do you want me to make love to you?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes I do," she said.</p> <p>"I think you do." He looked her in the eye. "My hand is not enough to make love to you."</p> <p>Tessa smiled as she thought this. "Maybe, if I'm lucky," she smiled to herself.</p> <p>"That's my Tessa. You always remember that. " he said as he ran his hand along her arm. "You have the smoothest fingers, the softest skin," he put his hand over her breast in an expression of reassurance, "and the softest pussy I've ever felt. Do you want this, Tessa?" he looked between her eyes as he did. For some reason, it felt so right to tell her she wanted him as much as she wanted him.</p> <p>She nodded yes as she felt him stroking the back of her hand with his. She felt her body tingle just a bit from his touch. "Do you want me to make love to you?" he asked again.</p> <p>"Yes!" she said.</p> <p>"Say it!" he whispered to her.</p> <p>"I want you to make love to me!" This time she let his hand touch her. It was not something that was going to happen because she felt so vulnerable right then.</p> <p>"Say it now," he said softly as he ran his fingers over her finger tips. She did not know how to do this. She wanted to do this. Now she knew it was a chance she was going to take, with or without his permission.</p> <p>"I want you to make love to my hand" she breathed. He looked into her eyes.</p> <p>"Do you feel anything," Tessa took in as he said her name. Her heart was beating loudly in her chest as she remembered his kiss.</p> <p>"You're beautiful," he said as heâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
