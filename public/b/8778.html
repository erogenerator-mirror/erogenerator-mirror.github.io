But neither said anything.</p> <p>The curtains parted after their second hug and they began to walk down the hallway, where they continued to see each other.</p> <p>They walked past the door to the balcony, where they both stopped and stared at me. They couldn't wait.</p> <p>Finally, I turned to them and gave them each a kiss. Both were still in heels – both wearing heels by now – and I thought they looked fabulous. I put my arms around each as I pulled them, one atop the other, under the duvet.</p> <p>Their hands found the backs of my thighs and began exploring me. One set of fingers found my lips and traced and teased, and then two fingers slid into my sex, spreading the juices that were already flowing from me.</p> <p>I had never been touched like this before, and the thrill to my very core sent me into orbit. I lay back, my breasts swaying in time with my rocking as the two sets of hands continued pleasuring me. And then one finger did something I hadn't been prepared for, it found my swollen clit and began to rub in slow circles.</p> <p>I couldn't hold it back very long. I started to rock up and down with the pressure of the orgasm building. Sheer pleasure swept over me and, in the throes of it, I came as well. The whole thing was unreal.</p> <p>When I opened my eyes, she was staring at me, looking at me, one eyebrow raised, the other crossed in front of her mouth, the same face you see when you look at each other and see something beyond what you are aware of.</p> <p>"You were great," she said suddenly. But, when I turned off the light and closed the curtains again, I felt a wave of guilt rise in me and I walked to embrace her again.</p> <p>"Thank you," I said, "I think I could have stayed the night if you wanted."</p> <p>"I wanted to stay the night," she said with a smile. "Because I know you like it as well."</p> <p>When she came again, I kissed her and said "I'm glad you still want me to do this."</p> <p>She squeezed my hand. "You are going to do something for me. We'll go to sleep, see who comes up for a while and maybe sleep together."</p> <p>"Yes," I replied. "I can't wait."</p> <p>In the moonlit room, the sun had risen high and cast a soft yellow glow at the balcony window. The curtains were opened and my room was lit, with candles on the tables. The room looked as though we had been there at sometime before, but it was not completely empty.</p> <p>I took my dress off, and they both stripped off their shoes and then they went to the bed, joining each other on each side of the bed.</p> <p>When I had had enough (and still needed more) from the kissing, we just lay side by side for a while, enjoying the feeling of the other's body as it slowly faded away.</p> <p>I felt as though I had been asleep for half an hour. The dream had been pleasant, but I think that could have been a lot more. But a whole new kind of dream is just as pleasant as the first.</p> <p>I closed my eyes and opened them again, this time to see an older woman sitting nearby, looking at me from afar.</p> <p>My eyes were closed and my hand automatically went to place on her knee.</p> <p>She didn't look at me, just smiled.</p> <p>At this moment, it was almost too much for me to bear. I didn't want to be the one doing this.</p> <p>To think I thought of a girl who could kiss you and not want to want you. I didn't think of her. I thought of what she looked like, had seen her on the Internet, what she would look like in front of you, had given her a name for you, would ask you to fuck her and do it.</p> <p>But then the memory came to me for—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
