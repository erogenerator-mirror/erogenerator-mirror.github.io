I said, "I have a better choice, now, I can make it for my car."</p> <p>"There now!" he exclaimed excitedly. "I'm proud of you!" he gushed.</p> <p>"Thank you, sir!" I replied. "Thank you for allowing me to share this with you! It's a privilege!"</p> <p>"This is only a sample, my friend," he told me and he pulled me along a corridor to the front lobby of my apartment. We entered a suite in which I recognized some of the furniture from our earlier visits before settling on a very comfortable, well light leather couch. I was feeling really comfortable, but still a little dizzy as my mouth began to feel dry. I took a seat on a sofa, feeling much better as I stared straight into the eyes of my captor, my father.</p> <p>"Now," he said, "this is what we do! The real test. What have you been doing all this time, my sweet girl? Do we prove to be of any use to you?"</p> <p>"My husband," I corrected his pronunciation of his name. "The man who owned this entire estate. Yes, my husband owns this building. It is the last house on the right."</p> <p>"So, you are now what you say is truly a slave of the Lord in order to be with us?" he said, his question almost amusing.</p> <p>"Yes, Mr. Clements, I am," I said with a smile. "I am totally yours."</p> <p>"And here is where the test begins!" He exclaimed. "You've seen what you've been given for my approval to be with that building, young lady. Now it is time to show you something!"</p> <p>With that, we had taken off our coats and hung them on a hook by his window. Our jackets and pants followed closely behind. He now wore the same long, leather trench coat he'd always worn the day he became a bride. His slacks were pulled tightly across his loins and his erect cock bobbed back and forth from his bellybutton. His face was smiling as it had those countless times before, when he gazed into my eyes with his own sparkling orbs as he held my hand. It was time for me to try what seemed so natural to him. I stood, slowly, as if I were going to walk around the room naked, as my hands folded behind my back and I waited nervously for my stepfather to speak.</p> <p>"Take off your coat!" he commanded me. "Put it on the chair there and get over to me."</p> <p>Reluctantly, I obeyed. Standing there in front of him, as he said, I had trouble getting the coat on with his help. I quickly removed myself from the coat and set the coat on the floor. With my hand behind me, I began by kissing and licking the base of his cock and balls before kissing the very tip of it. My lips formed into a circle as I slowly moved back and forth over the underside of his cock, feeling his heartbeat as I did. I could tell immediately that he was enjoying this as he was breathing very heavily and moaning at my every move. My lips pressed tightly and my tongue rubbed his hardness in long lazy strokes until his body began to tremble uncontrollably when I could tell that my own excitement was increasing too. The warmth between us increased as I moved up to meet his gaze. This time, my lips moved to the base of his cock. With my hand still behind my back, I lifted my body over the couch cushion to straddle him, and lowered myself onto his stiff cock, which easily penetrated my sopping wet pussy. It was like being inside the Sahara, the heat of the desert radiating out towards us from the clouds above. When my mouth was level with his ear, I slowly brought my hands behind my back and slowly lowered my head, taking his cock deeper into my mouth. I was so incredibly turned on by the sight of him, by his beautiful face, and especially by how he loved my lips so close to his shaft.</p> <p>His arms were behind his head as he raised his eyes to mine. Slowly, slowly his eyes became a slighter shade and I could see the desire in them. I could tell that he would soon be ready for me, for me to be with him. To be with him. He felt my hands gripping tightly to the cushion on which they lay down. I could feel him lifting my body, slowly, until I had at least my mouth over and between his chest and his lips. My mouth went from side to side and up and down over and around the head of his cock. My tongue caressing the underside of the sensitive cockhead and the sensitive underside of my lips. I could feel myself coming very quickly; at the same time I was so excited. I could feel his muscles moving inside my pussy, contracting and releasing over and overâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
