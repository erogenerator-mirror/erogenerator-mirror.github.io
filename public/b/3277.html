She had her hair back in a straight bob and her makeup was ready. As she came down the hall, she stopped in the doorway and we shook. She turned to smile at me as her eyes danced and her mouth went slack.</p> <p>"Oh, thank you for not getting me drunk?"</p> <p>I grinned. "You're a mess, sweetheart."</p> <p>She grinned back, too, and then kissed me tenderly.</p> <p>"Now, have fun."</p> <p>-</p> <p>We made the trip to the gym together, and by the time we got there, I felt as drunk as she did. We ended up working out together in the gym, and then we got dressed. We took the bus out to the bus station, and were on the first class seat of the train when they came over. There was a line and I slid my hand into her lap.</p> <p>"Hey, you're drunk."</p> <p>"Thanks. You have got some good stories."</p> <p>She smiled and looked up at me. "So, did you and my boyfriend...?"</p> <p>I felt a thrill run through me as a memory of when I had taken him under the table, with his tongue as it slid down my throat, came to me. The image made me feel warm and soft, and I squeezed her butt as she smiled and leaned back. I remembered, and so did she. We stood on the trolleys holding hands.</p> <p>"Yeah, he said he always liked kissing me, but we never did anything more."</p> <p>"I wonder why. I never had the opportunity until today."</p> <p>"Oh? I've known you a long time. We have always been friends."</p> <p>I felt a bit silly. "Yeah, I don't know. It's been a while since I knew you that well."</p> <p>"I haven't been here in a long time."</p> <p>Her eyes widened, and she leaned over and kissed me. This time it was a soft but firm, and she pulled back a little; she looked into my eyes for a moment, and then she looked back down at her fingers. I felt as if my heart would break with all I had felt.</p> <p>"I guess I missed it there. I haven't been with a man. No," she added softly, "no guys."</p> <p>In the back seat, I could feel my heart beating a little faster; I wondered, had I ever felt the urge with a woman. I looked into her eyes: I had, even before the train started to leave, felt it too. Her breasts were warm and full, and she was wearing a tight pair of black panties. I remembered the first time I had seen her naked on the train, and I was amazed that I had not been there as well, but then I thought about all the men who'd had their way with her. I felt my hand sliding against hers as she began softly talking to me, and I felt so relaxed sitting there between her legs. I turned to look at her face, and we kissed again.</p> <p>She was staring at me, and my expression was uncertain. I was unsure of whether or not I wanted to do the right thing, but I knew I had to.</p> <p>I smiled, and moved my hand from her lips to her waist, where her hand came up and held my face in her shoulder. I pressed my lips lightly against hers and moved my fingers up and down the inside of her thigh. She moved her hands under my arms to stroke my face, and her lips were on mine. Our tongues began to entangle, and I found myself pressing my hard cock against her lower belly.</p> <p>She broke the kiss and held my face to her own. I felt her eyes on mine as she pushed herself back against me.</p> <p>"Yes, oh, yes," she murmured in a breathless voice. "Touch me."</p> <p>I did so, with her mouth still locked around mine, and she gasped when I slipped one finger into her. I began to stroke her clit, and she moaned in return. I was in heaven, being alone with this gorgeous creature, and I was in heaven being with this woman who was making me crazyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
