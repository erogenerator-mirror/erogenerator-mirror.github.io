I quickly grabbed her panties and pulled them down, revealing her beautiful shaved pussy. I spread her lips with my fingers and dove in with my tongue. A rush of wetness made my cock jump. I moved my head up and down, sliding my tongue over her clitty until she began to writhe around on the bed.</p> <p>"Ohhh God!" I heard her gasp. "That...fucking...you...huh!...you...ohhh...dammit!...that...is...fuckin...yessss!"</p> <p>She let out a long, loud groan that I could only imagine was ecstasy.</p> <p>"Mmm...fuck me, Daddy." She encouraged. "Please..."</p> <p>"Don't...don't worry about that, baby." I replied. "I was just fucking horny, right as you asked."</p> <p>I pushed my tongue in further and she ground on it. She moaned into the sheets and came instantly. I worked up the rhythm of my thrusts against her clit, then went with it, sliding my tongue out to give her more to enjoy.</p> <p>"That...that's it, yessss!" she hissed. "Fucking drive me wild!...fucking drive me!"</p> <p>I kept working her clit in between my finger, then slid my middle finger in easily. She wrapped her legs around me and held tight. If I wasn't careful, I might have fallen of the bed. Her cries became louder and louder, and she pulled me in tight to her.</p> <p>"Make me cum again. Make me cum again. Please!" she cried.</p> <p>I kissed the side of her neck and her shoulder in a steady rhythm. I slid my cock all the way into her. My cockhead was slick with her juices. We could feel each other's heat. She was wetter than a pussy and I wasn't worried about going into it right away. I began to stroke my shaft, moving it back and forth between her pussy lips.</p> <p>"Oh God!...that...feels...so...good!" she screamed. "Fuck me hard. Make me cum again."</p> <p>"Uh...I didn't say...ahhh!...you...uhhh!...cancy...to...say...uh...to...uhhh..."</p> <p>"I want...to feel...uh...uh...fuck you all...right...before...uhhhhhh," she stammered. "Let me...uhhh fuck you!"</p> <p>"Be nice to me, Daddy. Make me feel good." If I hadn't kept sliding my cock in and out of her I would have come on the spot. I was starting to feel that familiar warmth. She was so wet! This was how wet she liked to come.</p> <p>I leaned my head down to kiss her. Her lips were swollen, but still sweet. I opened my eyes just in time to see a look of fear and surprise flash into hers.</p> <p>"What's the matter?" I asked her. "Didn't finish your punishment?"</p> <p>"It...uh...it's just...it's your...penis." She whimpered, but she couldn't have stopped if she didn't want to.</p> <p>"I know. I know," I said soothingly. "You're just...uhhh...a...goddamn it!...you are a good girl. You're a...good person. I...ohh...know that, yes!...that you have...um...needs...a...a boyfriend...that needs to...aahhh!...fuck. Him. Fuck you. Fuck him. Fuck him!"</p> <p>I worked my mouth on hers and brought her to my own. Our tongues darted wildly in each other's mouths.</p> <p>I slid my hand under her shirt, fondling her breast. She groaned as my finger traced her nipple. "What's wrong?" I asked her. "Don't you trust me?"</p> <p>"I trust you, Daddy. But, I don't want to be...uh...that way. I...I...I'm afraid I might..." she stammered.</p> <p>"Don't you want me to take you right here?" I whispered in her ear as I kissed the hollow of her neck.</p> <p>She just nodded.</p> <p>"I'll stop once I do," I whispered in her ear, and kissed her neck again.</p> <p>"What about your...penis?" I repeated the question gently.</p> <p>She nodded again.</p> <p>"Then say...please, Daddy," I said with a little bit of a smile, "don't make me stop."</p> <p>My tone of voice was soft, but I could still feel theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
