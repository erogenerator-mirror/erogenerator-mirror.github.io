I was already so hot and so ready for her that I was already soaking through the fabric. The whole scene, along with everything else, was more than I could ever put it through. I was completely naked, and she was so hot!</p> <p>She leaned in and kissed me. It was hard, but not as rough as it felt between my legs. I melted into her kiss. The taste of the juices that had just been on my lips, and the feel of her body, against mine as she licked me. I leaned my head back and kissed her even more forcefully as Beth's tongue invaded my mouth, probing for, and finding, all the things inside. I wanted her so desperately, I didn't care if anyone might see us. Beth slid her fingers inside my cunt, as she nibbled on my lower lip, and then she slid a finger inside of me.</p> <p>"Come to the pool," she murmured.</p> <p>I nodded. She pulled a chair up next to me, sat on it, and had me lean over. I was almost on this chair, her knee on the seat of the chair, rubbing my clit with her soft knee. Her hand was rubbing me again; my juices were running in little droplets out over my leg, and I could feel cum starting to drip out of me. The more she rubbed, harder I got; then her knee went off of the chair and landed across my face. I opened my mouth to protest, but instead her fingers were still all over my clit, rubbing it furiously as she squeezed my lips together and fingered me again. It was so amazing to just lick her fingers when they were inside my cunt, and it felt so good to do the same for her.</p> <p>After a couple of minutes of that, while I continued to fuck myself with Beth's fingers, she pulled away from my pussy and leaned in close to me. It was just about the time that I knew that she was about to put her mouth to my pussy. I could feel her hot breath against the wetness that she was still making.</p> <p>"Oh, God!" I said, as she took a long lick of my clit.</p> <p>"I want you to come," she said.</p> <p>"Oh, God," I said. "Fuck me."</p> <p>I put my hands between us and she got up off of the chair. I could feel her knees on the chair, her pussy right in front of my face. She turned around, got back down on her knees in front of me, straddled my legs, lowered herself, and guided my cock into her waiting fuckhole.</p> <p>I came as Beth did. I could taste my own cum on her mouth, and I could feel it running down my throat. I never want to be able to describe what it was like to cum so hard. Beth was right; I could actually feel the warm cum dripping out of her cunt, down my thighs, and onto my thighs, where they felt smooth and soft in the cold air of the room.</p> <p>I couldn't move. It became so intense, I lost control. The cum inside me shot out of me as Beth was still leaning down, and all of it ran onto the chair, and then on my legs. My arms went numb, my head went limp, and then I just lay there with my arms and legs still wrapped around her. I just laid there, I don't know how long, it was difficult to move. I didn't know it was possible to cum so hard. The feelings of ecstasy started to overwhelm me, and the room was just spinning. Everything seemed like it had just gotten a whole lot better when I just floated down from what felt like a full minute.</p> <p>I opened my eyes to glance at the clock, and saw it was 10:30-00. With nothing to do I just pulled myself up and laid down on a chairâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
