I said, and she began to lick off some of my essence. She didn't even think about it when she sucked my cock. She only moaned.</p> <p>I reached out and grabbed her hair and pulled her head up. She looked up at me, her brown eyes wide with fear. But I ignored her look. She knew exactly what I wanted, and I didn't care. My cock was throbbing in her mouth, almost touching her, begging her to give it to me. She swallowed, feeling every vein bulge as she sucked and licked me. And she did...almost...almost...oh yes. She sucked my cock, and I could tell she had an orgasm already.</p> <p>"You're too good." I moaned, and looked down between our chests at her. She looked up at me, her eyes wide with lust, her mouth hanging open, and her breasts swaying, her hair mussed and sweaty. She had a look of surprise.</p> <p>"You don't think it'll be like that, baby?"</p> <p>"It'll...I'll..." she gasped, and I pulled her to me again. I kissed her hard, our tongues dancing. She wrapped each of her arms around me, and reached between my legs to stroke me. I grabbed her behind her head.</p> <p>I turned her around, and got her onto her hands and knees.

I bent her forward with my hands against the door as I entered her from behind, and began pumping into her harder. It wasn't long before I could feel the start of impending orgasm. I reached out to her clit, running my fingers over it with my cock at the tip as I continued to fuck her. She reached back to her clit, rubbing it and I could feel her pussy quivering.</p> <p>"Cum for me, baby." I said as she brought her head to the mirror. If she could, she would have screamed out as I sent myself over the edge, cumming in her. She kept the moan in her throat as I erupted, filling her up as she came herself over and over again.</p> <p>She turned to face the mirror and began to moan again as more spasms wracked her body. I felt the warmth of her breath on my neck, the softness of her mouth. We fell to the bed together, spent.</p> <p>"I love you." I breathed softly, and she could barely whisper the words to me. I kissed her shoulder, and she turned to look at me.</p> <p>"I love you, too." and she kissed me.</p> <p>"I love you, too, Eric."</p> <p>As soon as our lips met she was gone.
