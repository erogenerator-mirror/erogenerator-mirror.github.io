I knew if my husband came in there the sex would be amazing.</p> <p>When he walked in I thought he had gone to the bathroom as it was a warm evening I wasn't sure he had a view of me. I was nervous but my pussy was burning and I knew I was having an orgasm.</p> <p>He walked to our table then sat with me he held me in his arms while he kissed me deeply. As our kisses ended he said, "I couldn't take this any longer."</p> <p>I was surprised at how aroused I was but then that didn't change as I could feel the warmth of wetness. He put his hand on my leg and I could feel he had no underwear on as I could feel the outline of his shaft pressing against me as it slid up and down my thigh as we kissed. It felt so good and I knew the excitement he was feeling added to my own excitement. At last he said, "We should get going before it all becomes too intense."</p> <p>I pulled back from our kiss and smiled as I said, "You are a good kisser. You must not feel left out." Then I looked at him smiling. His smile was as wide and wide as mine did so. I had to agree with him.</p> <p>We quickly got up and headed out. I grabbed my coat and we were off. I kept my hand on his arm as the elevator came up and when it reached our floor I said to him, "I'm really looking forward to the surprise."</p> <p>I knew he would. I hoped it will make me as wet as wet can make himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
