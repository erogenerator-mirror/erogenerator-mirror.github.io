You guys like this?" the waiter said as he brought the two steaks from the check-in counter.</p> <p>"Oh! Yes! Yes I do." Dale answered.</p> <p>Dale then picked up the steaks and held them over the edge of the grill as the man approached the grill.</p> <p>"Thanks." Dale said as he held on to them.</p> <p>He watched as the man reached into the pan and found a shrimp. He handed the shrimp to him as he continued to hold onto them. Dale reached up out and touched his hand to the man's cheek. He felt the man's flesh tense as Dale kissed him, lightly on the lips. The man responded by pressing his lips against Dale's.</p> <p>In their kitchen, Alex and his daughter, Jessica, laughed as they watched the man kiss and fondle her.</p> <p>"What's with the way the waiter is acting?" Alex asked.</p> <p>"That's because of you." she answered.</p> <p>Alex turned to her daughter. "You okay, Jessica?" she asked.</p> <p>"Not really." she answered.</p> <p>"Well, I think it's because you've been flirting with the man." Alex said.</p> <p>"Really, how do you know?" her daughter asked.</p> <p>"He's a good boy. We have known him for two years." Alex answered back.</p> <p>"Thank you for being as sweet as you can." Jessica said.</p> <p>"Oh, honey, you're the best." Jessica said.</p> <p>Dale then reached down and pulled on the waiter's hand, giving it a gentle shake.</p> <p>"Can we have the steaks on your table?" the man asked.</p> <p>"Let me go give them a hand." Alex instructed him as he headed to the counter on his way out.</p> <p>"Why thank you, sir." Dale smiled.</p> <p>"Would you care if we sat on your barstools?" Alex asked.</p> <p>"Sure. Sure." Dale replied.</p> <p>"I can sit next to you." Alex said. "I've got nothing better to do."</p> <p>"That would be great." Dale replied.</p> <p>"We should take this out on the grill." Alex suggested.</p> <p>"We could." Alex agreed.</p> <p>The man in the white T-shirt and dark sunglasses walked toward them when the man called out to him.</p> <p>"Excuse me, is this your first visit to the grill?" he asked.</p> <p>"What's your name?" Dale asked. "Are you a friend of yours?"</p> <p>"No, no. I'm not really a friend of yours..." the man stammered.</p> <p>"My apologies." Dale said, "I am Dale, from the college."</p> <p>The tall man shook Dale's hand and Alex quickly shook his hand.</p> <p>"You're very welcome." Dale replied with a smile.</p> <p>"You're new." Alex said.</p> <p>"I'm Alex." he replied.</p> <p>They both then walked on out of the kitchen door. Dale looked over at his daughter and smiled.</p> <p>"You know," she said, "you always said the same thing when I asked you a question."</p> <p>They then walked to the truck.</p> <p>Dale opened the truck door and pulled Jessica into the cab. He then opened a glove box and removed a black leather glove. He then returned both of his hands to Jessica's. The man shook Jessica's hand and then turned to Alex, placing the glove back on his right hand.</p> <p>"This is Jessica, she is the friend I asked you to have." the man explained. "I have been coming to these places because I have been working on a project for my boss. He wanted a private jet for his private jet business."</p> <p>"Well, your boss wants to have a private jet, so I thought you should come and join us." Dale answered.</p> <p>"Ah. Good idea. Where is your friend, Alex?" Dale asked.</p> <p>"He's in his office. He's not here right now but he is going to be here soon." Dale replied.</p> <p>The man's face was priceless as he said goodbye on the telephone. Alex had never seen Dale so turned on at one time. Dale then turned up the radio to a soft, ambient song that his sister and mother could hearâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
