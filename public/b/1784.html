I had to tell the guy how to do it. When I was done, he came in and said I could help him.. he said he was going to get something and I could go in to put on my clothes. I thought it strange, but the man just asked me to go out of the office and see him. I told him "Sure".</p> <p>The job at the agency was like all the others. I worked with Mr. C. and he was friendly and had a soft touch in the office.. in other words he did a lot of personal grooming. We didn't have a lot of time when I got there. Most of it was just in the mail order bags when I saw him. We talked about everyday things as I walked by and looked in the mirror, and I couldn't help but think that I was looking at a younger version of Dave. I guess he was in his late thirties, I'm not sure, but he was the most confident person I have come across.. we agreed that the two of us would be best friends.</p> <p>I went into the bathroom and put on my robe and looked out the door as Mr. C walked out. He came in with a couple towels and he dried me and he said it was time for me to go back to bed. I agreed to return in the morning and as he finished, Mr. C told me I could stay until the end of the day.</p> <p>After my shower, I dressed and went home. As I stepped out the front door, Mr. C handed me the phone. I thought I wanted to call him, but I just knew no, not that he was going to come out there and make a point of calling me in a couple of minutes.</p> <p>I went to the coffee table and sat down to make a cup, when he came out and sat down next to me and said that I need to meet up at the office to work on making the room work and to take a look around the office. Then he said that my wife was coming today, so I had to hurry and that I had to leave to go meet her in the office before I left. It was all I could do to get my mind clear as I left there with my thoughts swirling about what he might mean by "going out" that night. ...to Be continuedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
