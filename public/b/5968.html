She snickered, then spun around to face me. I tried my best not to stare at her, but the more I looked at her, the more I got the feeling that she wasn't lying.</p> <p>"No, I can't be having such trouble."</p> <p>With that, she pulled me closer to her and planted a kiss on my lips. I don't know how long it lasted, but she eventually began to relax and allowed me to slide my hand down over her shoulder.</p> <p>"I'm starting to get excited," she said softly, as her hand slid up and pulled the back of my shirt down to reveal one of her soft, pink nipples. "I think I'm going to love having my hands all over you."</p> <p>And then she was kissing me again, and as we kissed, my dick was hard in my khakis, and I was wondering how I didn't have a similar problem from the minute I realized that my erection wasn't visible to her as I felt my shorts fly open.</p> <p>As the kiss became more intense, I felt the soft fabric of her shirt press against my dick, and it felt good, because it was starting to get hard too, as I felt her breathing get deeper as she began to moan herself.</p> <p>The feeling of her nipples brushing along my bare chest as her hand began to slowly slide up and down along my shaft was incredible. It was weird to look at one after the other with her in my eyes, knowing just what she was doing, and yet knowing exactly how turned on I was. It was probably my imagination, but I felt her hips start to slowly move, and then suddenly everything went dark as her mouth slid down between my lips.</p> <p>Her lips were softer than mine, and as her lips brushed against mine, that feeling was amplified a dozen fold. Her tongue slid along my lips, and suddenly she seemed like she was all over me. All I could concentrate on was her hand, which was slowly sliding up and down my cock through the fabric of my shorts, a hand I had never felt before.</p> <p>"Oh my," I heard her whisper, as my tongue found hers and we began our dance.</p> <p>As my tongue was exploring her mouth, our kiss intensified. Her hand kept sliding along my dick as I lifted a hand up to her face, pulling her to me and kissing her deeply. We were now both moaning, and even more so when we finally pulled back, and I could feel the moistness between her legs.</p> <p>"I'm going down on you," I heard her say, as we broke our kiss. Her hand went to my mouth as she slowly moved me back down onto the couch and onto her knees in front of me. Before I knew it, she was licking me from the base right to the tip before taking me inside her mouth once again.</p> <p>I let out a long, slow groan as she slid the whole thing into her mouth on her own, pushing a pillow at the base of my dick with her other hand. I could feel my eyes roll back into my head as she wrapped her lips around me, and she bobbed her head up and down on me for a long while, her hand pumping back and forth against me.</p> <p>After a minute or two, she finally popped off me and stood up, pulling her shirt off and then sliding her shorts and panties off over her hips. She was a woman of the world now, and the feeling I had just felt was making me crazy. "Damn," I thought to myself, as my eyes drifted down to her tanned body. "There's that fucking amazing body all mine."</p> <p>She straddled my lap and rubbed my dick in her pussy several seconds longer than I'd expected before she finally sat down on it, which was enough to get me inside her. I had the sudden urge to grab her hips and lift her up and down on my cock again, but I couldn't. Just when I thought I couldn't stand the thought any longer, this woman really had the body of a goddess, and her body was incredible. When she finally came, I was amazed at how wet she was, which seemed to turn me on something fierce. She squealed around my dick for an eternity then, and I could feel her pussy contracting around me at the same time she gave another gasp.</p> <p>After resting a minute or two, she sat down in front of me and lifted her hips up again. For a moment, I took her hand and felt it between us. I looked at the most beautiful and perfectly manicured pussy I had ever seen! I felt my dick start to throb a little more, just at being there, so I turned her and began to kiss it. I could taste the soap on herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
