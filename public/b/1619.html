It wasn't exactly what I expected." I said.</p> <p>"Well, you just made it look like I was being an asshole."</p> <p>I got the impression she was angry, but, hey, there's nothing wrong for a little anger. As soon as she walked away, a whole lot of my ire was gone. She'd gotten me where I wanted to be, and the whole hell hath no fury cast. Now what?</p> <p>I took up a position on the sofa, my hand working my dick and looking up at the ceiling for signs of movement. The next thing I knew, I was having sex with my girlfriend, no, my gorgeous girlfriend.</p> <p>"You're in my room, now." I said and turned around. It would have been hard for her to get away, but I couldn't resist. I didn't care if she was my girlfriend.</p> <p>"No, it was just nice to have an escape while I was distracted." she said and we kissed passionately.</p> <p>"It really was." she said, breaking the kiss and sitting back on the sofa. She took the remote from me and, to my surprise, sent an image of the previous night flashed in my head. I felt a mixture of desire and jealousy that would later be erased by pure lust. "You made me do things I never thought I would! I don't know."</p> <p>"I can't tell you how many times I imagined that would happen."</p> <p>"So you want to stop?" she asked.</p> <p>"No. I mean, I would have loved it." I was just a little confused. I mean, I was a normal guy, so I didn't know if I could continue.</p> <p>"I mean, are you sure about this?"</p> <p>"I promise to please you. Don't you think I should be the one to initiate it?" was all I could think of to say. She stood up and removed her panties and handed them to me. As I tossed them to the floor, my mind raced to how she would explain to my parents what we did on Friday night. What was she going to do? I couldn't really say exactly what she would and couldn't say. I wasn't sure. What would she do? Then the doorbell rang.</p> <p>The two of us got up and the door opened before I could think. The smile on her face when she saw me surprised me and caused another of my intense fantasies to pop up.</p> <p>"Come in, Jim." she said with a smile. I opened the door and was greeted by a sight I had kept a secret from myself for far too many years. I could imagine her lying on her bed in just her bra and panties, lying on her back, her arms over her head and one leg slightly bent and her pussy opened for me. The sight of her pussy lips and the wetness were driving me crazy. I got the courage to ask her something while we were in the living room.</p> <p>"Are you...um." She answered with a laugh.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"This was the night before Saturday." she replied, sitting back on the couch. "This was the night you said you were going to make it happen." She then gave me a knowing smile and closed her legs, the panties pulled away from her pussy and left behind a wet stain.</p> <p>"You weren't kidding. That was the night before you came on to me." I was beginning to get a little embarrassed and a bit embarrassed that she was getting turned on while her parents thought I was drunk and wanted sex. My mind turned to the night before she gave me a quick blowjob in their bed and I got a raging hard on that was very distracting. But as we sat in that silent area, I could really picture the look on her face when she saw her parents naked. Was she shocked or turned on? I'm not sure if I should have been. I should have just gotten dressed and left to go to bed.</p> <p>"I should apologize to my parents." I said as innocently as possible. "I know how hard it is to come out to them, especially when I am drunk and horny." she said, smiling and moving toward me. Then, she walked over and leaned against me and put her arms around my neck. I thought that it was a bit inappropriate and was about to give her a little show, but, that would have been far too forward.</p> <p>"I know you have been going to the trouble of making your parents angry the last couple of days." she said, with a cheeky smile, "You should have apologized to them." I nodded and she continued: "The truth is, I was going to take it in my stride or I had probably just lost my best friend and would have ended up on drugs." I was so embarrassed.</p> <p>"I suppose so," Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
