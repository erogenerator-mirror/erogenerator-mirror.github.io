"Don't talk about it. It's no big deal. Anyway, it was a little unfair that she chose you for the team. That, and your cock feels like a baseball."</p> <p>"Not bad. Are you sure? Is it the best for you? You look nice. And I know I should have put it in her. But I don't..." David paused.</p> <p>"You are a good man. I'm sorry. No need to apologize and no need to get jealous," I smiled and kissed him lightly on the cheek, "I like you. I like you a lot."</p> <p>"It's a beautiful thing," he responded and kissed my lips. "When you think about it, yeah. I like what we have. It's just a coincidence, no big deal."</p> <p>And so we were in the morning when we awoke and decided it was a bit early to have sex. We showered together and got out the old fashioned style. The two of us had washed and then dressed ourselves in the sexiest pj's I could buy for us.</p> <p>We had a nice breakfast in a motel room on the weekend at a local breakfast. With two women in the front section we could watch the morning broadcast on the small television in our room. We had two separate separate bathrooms to wash our dirty clothes.</p> <p>Back in the motel we showered together, again, kissing in the shower, kissing again. When we were out of the shower we got dressed, still kissing.</p> <p>"It's late morning," I said, "Let's go. We'll catch the news. I want you to wear your best. Oh, and on Friday it's going to be a long drive. You get a call from your Mom and an early meeting with someone who'll be in town all day Saturday."</p> <p>"That's fine. I'd better hurry," she said, her eyes glistening from the shampoo, "I think we're really going to have time to enjoy each other's company."</p> <p>"Just for a day. Oh, and a quickie, too, I think. Okay?"</p> <p>"Sure. Let me get dressed." She had already made a quick pass at the other bed.</p> <p>"Okay. I'll be down by the lake and we can take a little time."</p> <p>We went out to the lake. There was a large bay on the shoreline, which was mostly empty. We walked a short distance to the shallow end. After checking off a couple of other places on our trip, we arrived at the far bank and walked slowly around the lake.</p> <p>"We'll make camp for the night," I said and led her out to the boat. There were a couple of wooden trailers and a few other things along the shoreline, along side our house.</p> <p>"Is the place secluded enough, we'll never be caught," she said.</p> <p>"Not even by a shark," I said and gave her a playful smack.</p> <p>"Ouch! You really are a bastard," she complained and kissed my cheek. "The next boat we get is a fishing boat, won't they catch your cock?"</p> <p>"They won't," I assured her.</p> <p>"Are you sure I can wait? That's all you got."</p> <p>"If it doesn't bother you, I'll be out of here by nine," I said and she smiled. "Besides, it might be worth the wait."</p> <p>She looked at me as she walked along the beach, her bare breasts visible under her sun dress. "Well, maybe," she said, "If they can wait that long."</p> <p>She headed up a trail to the boat. She paused. "Hair, maybe," she offered. I nodded and ran my finger around her throat.</p> <p>"No strings," I told her, "Just let me."</p> <p>She came out in a bathrobe and sat down on a dock. She didn't waste any time, however, and reached into a bin to put her hair in a ponytail while I fetched the rope they'd used to tie her feet up.</p> <p>"I know you'll be up by nine, but it's important we do this right. You'll be surprised. How did you know about this boat?" I was very concerned that this might be our last time getting in and out of the woods.</p> <p>"I heard that when I was a kid. Someone taught me that it was better to build a house on sticks instead of on water," she said with a twinkle in her eye. "It took all my thinking for me to understand what it was for people to sit around and listen to their feelings when they were unhappy. Now you help me build a house. How does that soundâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
