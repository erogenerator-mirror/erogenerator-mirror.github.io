I am not sure that most of it is true but I have found it amusing.</p> <p>This chapter is a bit of a departure from regular sex. So when I think it's appropriate, a story about my ex that is out of control as he has always been, goes very much that way.</p> <p>I hope you enjoy.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>The following chapter will be about his fantasy. It will start with a little background.</p> <p>I will start this chapter at a point at the beginning of his story where I thought that most of what began happening to him would be the stuff most people dream about. I would like to point out that I haven't had sex in a long time. So when I look back to his story, I think I should really start at the beginning.</p> <p>I have decided not to get into all the details but I am going to put more into the beginning.</p> <p>So, I am here. I hope you enjoy it.</p> <p>Thanks,</p> <p>Yours,</p> <p>Tom</p> <p>***********************</p> <p>Mira was waiting for me at a nice hotel in New York. She arrived a few minutes after I arrived. We arranged to meet at our hotel, in the city she told me was called 'The New York City Hilton'. She was a beautiful woman and from behind she took my hand firmly and led me into the elevator.</p> <p>After the elevator door closed, she took me back to the room. She looked at the time and said; "We have a lot of time to get to and then it won't be long before our meeting!" She smiled and headed for the bedroom. I followed, following in my excitement. When I closed the door and pushed her gently down onto the bed, her eyes glowed with excitement. The next few times the door closed they were just as she was getting on. When the door would close, I would push the button, she would press it.</p> <p>When I got into the elevator with her and we were out of the hotel room before we got to the room I asked her; "Was it what you had in mind?"</p> <p>She smiled back to me and said, "I am having a great time. There is no way I could have waited any longer."</p> <p>"No, it was wonderful and not as pleasant as you had planned!" I replied.</p> <p>We entered the elevators and we soon found ourselves walking arm in arm to the elevator lobby. After stepping in, I took her hand and she followed with me. We went through the lobby.</p> <p>When the doors closed, we had some time to ourselves. It was not exactly what I had planned but I made the right decision. I took her hand and led her.</p> <p>"This time we will really be apart." I said, "and I will be there with you."</p> <p>I led her into our room and she took a gentle step into mine. We slowly sank into the bed and she reached up and placed her arms around my waist pulling her body against mine.</p> <p>I pressed my body against hers, our legs intertwined. I could feel the heat of her body against my legs. Her breasts brushed back and forth across mine. Our mouths met and she took my head in her hands kissing it back.</p> <p>She whispered; "When is the next time we spend time together, this time is special and special."</p> <p>I looked deeply into her eyes and said, "We have a lot to get to know and do, we will have to think of the time to love."</p> <p>She just smiled and pressed her body hard against mine. I could feel her breasts crushed against my chest.</p> <p>Our mouths found each other again. She gently moved the lower part of her body onto mine. Her body was so soft and warm and it made all the difference in the world in that instant. She kissed me passionately, running her fingers through my hair then running her fingers down my spine toward my buttocks.</p> <p>She pulled me toward her, our mouths locking in an intense kiss. Our kisses became more violent, as if I needed to do so.</p> <p>She stopped kissing and rolled us over, our stomach pressed into the bed as I put my arms around her. I had never felt this way in my life and yet I had fallen for her.</p> <p>There was always this moment when we were not together. As we lay, we kissed again, her body pressed to mine. This time our bodies moved independently, our lips separated by only one finger and then by each other's mouth.</p> <p>I had not felt this about her. This woman needed to be loved. I wanted her to be loved.</p> <p>I put my hands around her, caressing her face and shoulders. I moved down her side and pulled her towards me. She moved to me and I could not resist kissing her again.</p> <p>The kiss had movedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
