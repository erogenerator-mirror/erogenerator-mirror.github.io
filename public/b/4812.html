Mike opened the car and they got out and went through the usual procedure for taking a taxi.</p> <p>"Where will we meet?" she asked.</p> <p>"Well we would just drive over to our apartment," Mike replied. "We are driving on the way to your place."</p> <p>Mike took her hand and she let him pull her to him and they walked across town. Her blouse was off in front and there was no bra and it was easy to see that Mike's nipples were hard and poking up.</p> <p>"This is going to be fun. This place has a hot tub." Mike said.</p> <p>Mike took the handbrake off and took her to a little house in the woods. Mike opened the door and held a lantern light on the deck. He turned the setting on and she looked at the bathroom and looked at Mike.</p> <p>"We need to do this right." She said.</p> <p>Mike knew what she meant, but he liked it and he was prepared.</p> <p>Mike led Katie into the tub and they sat down. Katie moved to Mike to put her arms around him and they stood there for a couple of minutes. They kissed and she ran her hands along his muscular chest.</p> <p>"I've missed having you in my arms." She whispered.</p> <p>Mike was in full agreement with this statement. When they broke it he took her hands in his and moved them over his belt. When he undid her button and pulled her shorts and panties down he dropped to his knees on the deck and pulled them off.</p> <p>Katie stood up in only her panties. Mike reached down and pulled them off. He tossed them to the side and she stepped out of them. Mike moved up to her legs and pulled the panties over her shoes and then he picked them up and tossed them to the side. He dropped to his knees and lifted her right knee out of the way and gently pushed her legs apart to expose her wet pussy.</p> <p>"You are incredible, my love." He told her.</p> <p>"I haven't been kissed like that in years." She said. "I've missed a good kiss."</p> <p>Mike took her right hand and placed it on his penis. It felt the first bit of heat on it, then he took her two hands and moved them to his dick. He rubbed her fingers up and down the shaft while he began to kiss her. Katie took hold of his neck and her lips found his. Mike took her tongue into his mouth as her left hand pulled his body to her. Their mouths opened and he felt her breast touch the hardness of his cock in her hand.</p> <p>Mike moved his hands down the front of her body and between her legs. He found her opening and with one motion he put his fingers into her folds and found her clitoris. When he rolled the hard nub between his index and middle finger Mike felt Katie pull her body toward him. Her fingers held his head tight in their embrace and when he let go of her clit she grabbed his head and forced his mouth to her with all the energy she could muster. Mike felt his wife pull his mouth from her body and he looked up at her face that was flushed and bright with desire.</p> <p>"Did I do that to you?" He asked.</p> <p>"Oh yes. I never felt like that with anybody else." She said, moving her body to meet his.</p> <p>Mike moved her to the back of the tub. He put a pillow under her hips and sat her down. He leaned forward until his cock was right at crotch level and kissed her again.</p> <p>"I have to be ready for you." She smiled at him and reached through his legs to her dildo and put it on the base of it.</p> <p>She lifted her legs on either side of him. Mike used both hands to spread her, then he used his hands to spread her more. He ran both his palms and fingers over her lips and clit until her body arched and she cried out. Her body trembled and she looked at his face and saw the look of determination in his eyes.</p> <p>She lifted her left knee and pressed it against his pelvis. Mike pressed the head of his erection into her and found her opening in the front and she gasped when he entered. They kissed and when Katie started to undulate her torso up and down Mike moved his hands to her breasts. He felt them move with her and when her breathing became shallow and his balls began to ache he moved his hands to her waist.</p> <p>He held onto the base of her breasts in his hands and leaned over so he could kiss her neck. Katie felt the head of his cock push against her and Mike knew that she too was anticipating his entry. He kissed around her lips and her face, and found the corners of her mouth with his tongueâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
