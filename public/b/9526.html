It's nice and soft," she said rubbing it with her free hand, while gazing off into the corner of her eyes.</p> <p>"Honey, you're really not that old, you know," I told her.</p> <p>"Oh, you're not old, you just won't cum yet. You see, I'm just trying to make you feel good. That makes me feel good too." She said teasing, as she turned her head to one side and slowly lowered her head to my crotch, which had a nice, thick cock to match.</p> <p>"I love you." She said with the sweetest voice she could muster. The feeling of her lips on my cock and her warm, soft tongue licking the whole length of it was too much. She slid me into her warm mouth and went all the way down my seven and a half inch cock in one slow motion. It was heaven, and her warm mouth felt so good as she slid all the way down each inch.</p> <p>As she worked all the way to the base on my cock, we kissed and hugged and I caressed her lovely, round little ass. The feeling in my loins was incredible and I couldn't believe how fantastic it was going to feel when we made love again.</p> <p>Her hands were in her lap as she stroked my cock. "Oh, it's so big. It's so thick!" she sighed as she bobbed up and down on my cock. Her mouth was like velvet. I tried to hold back, but she knew it, and she knew I was. I came in her mouth, and she sucked me dry. She was like a pro. She got up, turned around and looked at me as if to say "You have been dreaming of this all along". She pulled her hair back and kissed me hard on the lips.</p> <p>"We're going to do this once in a while," she said.</p> <p>"I can get the whole thing in me," I told her. "It's my first real cock" I added.</p> <p>"Oh, you're sure about this. We're all going to enjoy it." She said with a very excited smile.</p> <p>As we dressed, she hugged me, and kissed my cheek on the way out of her store. "We have to make a good choice of a nice hotel. You're right, we do have one. I'm sure you'll love the view it will have of your cock being swallowed. It will make that big thing so much easier to swallow that little piece of meat that you are now so expertly using. You won't mind it though if we make this a regular thing, would you?"</p> <p>"Absolutely," I said, as I was about to open the front of my pants.</p> <p>"Would you like to make love there? Here? That's where you belong. I love you so much tonight. I want to share you with everyone tonight and be inside of your body when we're both happy. Maybe we should make a room for myself at our next anniversary." I gave her a big hug and kiss.</p> <p>"I've got a surprise for you. Just one thing. Would you be interested in that? I'll be watching and waiting at the door in ten minute. You can leave a little tip for me on the way out. You have so much to see and do." I told her.</p> <p>She hugged me closer to her and said, "Oh, that was a wonderful idea. You've got quite a way to go. I feel so good that you just have to take me. I've only been with guys before, and didn't much care for it until tonight. And you're not so big that I could take it, so I'll just wait until tonight. It does feel like a new lover."</p> <p>We kissed and hugged for a few minutes. "You better go," she said as her kisses ran all the way down my neck. "I'm going shopping with my friends." She got up, but I was right behind her. "I'll talk to you tomorrow, at lunch time. I love you."</p> <p>"See you tomorrow," was all I could answer. She said, "Love you," and she kissed her lips in my direction.</p> <p>We left the store together, and went to our own separate rooms to get ready to continue our afternoon fun.</p> <p>- - - - - - - - - - - - -</p> <p>It was just after 8am on Tuesdayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
