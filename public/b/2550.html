I'm sorry. Why aren't you all over the place?" Mary looked around, hoping to see some kind of reason, or at least someone in the vicinity. Her eyes flickered over to a pair of guys, one of whom looked more than friendly, perhaps the owner of the shop she worked at.</p> <p>"Not a thing happened."</p> <p>"I'm sorry. I was just thinking, how nice to meet you today. You look nice. I mean your hair. What do you do?"</p> <p>"I teach. What do you mean?" Mary said.</p> <p>"I'm your teacher and you aren't, you know?"</p> <p>Mary had caught herself, and was caught for sure, but now she could actually blurt it out without looking embarrassed. Her cheeks went red. "Um, well, it's just..."</p> <p>Mary just finished her thought and started again. "You're really lovely." She said. "I can help you out though, you see? Why don't you come back to my house with me... with me now?"</p> <p>The thought alone seemed to thrill the guys. Mary's heart was racing. She had never acted in a way like this before. She felt like she was in a sex fueled frenzy where she wanted it. She liked the attention.</p> <p>"Oh, I think I'd like that..." The guy said.</p> <p>Mary nodded. "Great!" The guy said and stood up.</p> <p>Mary was standing there looking, as her friend turned around and looked back at her ass, her tits hanging out. She wanted to grab her tits and squeeze them. Her ass was still full and proud, but when she stood up and turned around, it kind of wiggled out again. She smiled to herself, "That would be great..."</p> <p>"So, you girls, do you like to fuck, right here or on a couch or something?" The guy asked with a smile. Mary had looked at his eyes to make her decision and she couldn't do anything else, so she just nodded. As they walked, her hand started to move again and she thought she was going to fall over. It didn't stop. Neither moved her.</p> <p>"Do you ever do that?" the guy asked.</p> <p>Mary looked the guy in the eye and nodded. "Sometimes..." She looked away, ashamed again.</p> <p>"Do you see?" Mary felt her cheeks turn pinker.</p> <p>"Sometimes. I like doing it in the back yard," She blurted out, embarrassed again by her response.</p> <p>"Yeah, you know I'm going to ask you to bend over for me?"</p> <p>"No. This is going to be fun. I'll be as naked as a man."</p> <p>Mary looked away again. She was about to say something else, but was cut off.</p> <p>As they walked toward her apartment, the guy grabbed her hand and pulled her on by the arm. Mary found that she couldn't say anything or even look the guy in the eyes. Not to mention it felt weird to walk behind her. If she couldn't keep the guy off her, then she would do it, or at least sit still and give them a show. They just walked toward the apartment. As they got closer, Mary realized that she was looking back at the guy in the eyes and she actually began to get a wet feeling in her pussy as something stirred inside her. She looked back. The guy was still looking back at the guy. Their faces met and Mary felt really awkward.</p> <p>"That's an amazing thing to see in person." He said. Mary's eyes wandered down to the guy's ass. This guy had a great ass. Her eyes dropped to his pants. The top wasn't very tight. She thought of going down and grabbing ahold of it, but instead of doing that, she reached in. To her surprise, she was actually doing it. Mary's heart froze for a second. She was shocked and looked away. A few minutes later, the guy's fingers got back grip on her hand and turned toward him. He pulled Mary's fingers through his pants and touched her clit. Mary felt a wave of pleasure ripple up and down her body and her back arch. It was like a light bulb just came on on and her insides exploded.</p> <p>"Ahhhh!" Mary screamed. She could feel her body spasm around her, and she loved the feeling. Mary grabbed her skirt and her friends hand and ran away from the stranger. The guys eyes followed her. Mary could feel her skirt was probably the only thing covering her body, and there was no way to stop him from finding her panties. She ran off to her car. The guy didn't see her go. The stranger had just walked over and was staring at her ass. He was clearly mesmerized by it now. Mary didn't know how to act around themâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
