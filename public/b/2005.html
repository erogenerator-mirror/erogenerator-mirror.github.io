At first I was in shock and felt her firm breasts press against my chest. Then the warmth of the kiss spread throughout my body and she began to caress and massage me.</p> <p>"Why are you here?" she asked.</p> <p>"I have decided to spend the evening at a party I'm having at the Ritz Carlton. It would be safe and the pool is quite entertaining."</p> <p>"That's great. You're so sweet." She then took me by the hand and led me over to the stairs leading up to our suite. She led me to an area that was filled with couches and chairs.</p> <p>"You know exactly how to strip, don't you?"</p> <p>"Y...yes."</p> <p>"Now." I watched as she unbuttoned her blouse and dropped it on the floor, showing off her bra, which was clearly visible beneath her top.</p> <p>She pushed her panties to the floor, stepped out of them and kicked them off, and stepped into the pool. As she swam nude for five or six minutes she continued to talk to me about that evening.</p> <p>"So what do you think about letting me join you here?"</p> <p>I wasn't sure what she meant, but the way she was looking at me it made me very happy to hear that, and I knew that she was thinking that too.</p> <p>She continued to swim a bit more then she pulled herself out of the pool, dried off and jumped into our suite. We kissed and fondled each other for an hour or so, as our bodies writhed and explored each other, until finally we were both naked, and with me on top of her, which was also something she liked.</p> <p>"I'm so wet I need you to fuck me."</p> <p>All the time we were making out she was playing on my cock. I pulled my shorts off and climbed off to the far end of the pool. Reaching out I grabbed her ankles and lifted each one as high as she could go, then my cock slid inside. She screamed as I bottomed out and I started to plunge in and out of her.</p> <p>"I've been wanting you inside me all evening."</p> <p>"You're going to cum in me, aren't you?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>Her legs were wrapped around my waist and our bodies were shaking with need for each other. The water continued to spray over us as we both came within moments and I felt like I was going to shoot my sperm into her. She wrapped her arms around me, kissing me on the cheek and then on the mouth, as I felt her shudder and moan.</p> <p>"Mmmmmm."</p> <p>I held my body still as we finally caught our breath.</p> <p>"Honey, that was great."</p> <p>"But I'm still so wet."</p> <p>"We need to shower," I said.</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>She stood up. I watched as she stepped out of the pool and grabbed some towels and started to dry her hair and body. She turned and handed one to me. I looked in the mirror at her and smiled. I picked up my shorts and went into my bathroom to shower.</p> <p>I shaved, turned the shower on, closed the door and got in. I watched as she pulled on a bra and pulled on some panties and a blouse, but then changed into a skirt. I then headed for the shower and closed the door and stepped in. My cock stayed hard as I thought about what she had said, and what she had said about me coming to her and having a threesome.</p> <p>I finished the shower and got out. I went to the mirror and looked at myself. My body was as good as she had said and my face looked just as sexy as I had imagined. I went back into the living room where my clothes were lying and picked up the clothes I had worn to the party. The door to my room was closed, and it felt like I had an extra security blanket covering me. My cock sprung to life as I thought about what I was going to do tomorrow after the party.</p> <p>I got out of the shower, dried my hair and went to my room. I grabbed my towel off the floor and walked back into my room. My room was empty. I got up and went looking out. Not sure how long I could wait to hear how it was going.
