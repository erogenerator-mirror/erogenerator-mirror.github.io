When she was ready, she sat down on the bed to change her nightie, and when she came back through the door, I was ready for her. She looked just great as she looked in her bedroom.</p> <p>“Hey Mandy,” I said as I stepped over to her’s to kiss her on the cheek.</p> <p>“Hi honey,” we both said as we embraced. After a brief peck, I whispered to her “We better not wear out the lights.”</p> <p>With a hug I asked, “Did you sleep good last night?”</p> <p>She giggled and said, “God yes honey,” as she pulled me on top of her.</p> <p>I started kissing her neck and running my hands down her flat stomach. I slowly moved my hands down to her crotch, and felt that she was already wet. While I had been kissing her, I slowly slid a finger into her slit. It opened up enough for me to slide another finger into her hot wetness. I kissed her and held her tight as I fingered her. She was moaning and breathing harder. Suddenly I took care of one last thing and slid my hard cock in the soft and smooth folds of her pussy.</p> <p></p> <p>She started gasping for breath as her hand started to rub my nuts. I kept kissing her, and just held myself there as long as she would let me. I lifted her legs up over my shoulders. This allowed her to pull on my cock deeper, and with the other hand she was stroking me. Her eyes were closed, and her moans were loud and wild.</p> <p>I was moaning softly while kissing her and she was moaning back at me. Her moans grew louder when I slowly took her hand off my dick. I was already in her all night, and I knew this would be my last chance. With both hands in her, one on her breast the other on the bed, I leaned forward and whispered “God, I love you.”</p> <p>With the other hand on her breast she just moaned even louder. Then I whispered in her ear “Fuck me now.”</p> <p>She was now ready to take charge, and I was getting impatient, so she just smiled at me, and took her hand off of me. When she went over to the chair and started to change clothes again, I said, “What’s wrong?”</p> <p>“Nothing,” she answered. “I just don’t want you to stop, and I want the feeling of you.”</p> <p>So I got up from the bed and took her by the hand. When we were walking down the hall to her bedroom, I was kissing her cheek and giving her a little peck on the lips. She gave me a quick peck back, while looking back at me. It got to the point that we were kissing, and I was just getting started.</p> <p>“Just give me your bedroom number,”</p> <p>We both said “Ok” in our breath. It felt like it took forever for us to get to the top. As our lips met, I could feel her hands start to undo my shirt. When she started to pull my shirt off, she turned her head to kiss me on the lips again. Then she reached under my shirt to feel for my cock. Her hand started to stroke my cock harder and faster. We kissed again with each other, and just stood there letting our tongues slide around. Then I started to say something to her, but she just laughed. She kissed me on my lips one more time and pulled me onto the bed.</p> <p>We kissed again and lay there getting turned on. She took my cock and rubbed it up and down her slit. Her pussy was very wet. She knew exactly how to make my cock go in, while still teasing my nipples, and it took a little help from me to slide into her. I could feel her pussy lips wrap around me, and I stopped my progress halfway and leaned forward. My elbows were on the sideboard and I could pull her hips down and my cock went deeper into her. She grabbed my chest and kissed me with passion. She pushed her hips back against mine.</p> <p>“Oh god!” I said into her ear as we kissed. “I love you.”</p> <p>I could hear her say these little half-moans, but all the time she was kissing my lips, and rubbing herself against my cock.
