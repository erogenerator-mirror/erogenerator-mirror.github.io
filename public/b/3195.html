"I...I'm..."</p> <p>"Tanisha Pinder," she said with a little smile.</p> <p>"I know...thanks."</p> <p>She reached up and stroked his cheek. "I'd hoped that it'd be so."</p> <p>He leaned down and gently kissed Tanisha's lips. She returned the kiss, gently, just as she had with his sister. She felt his hand slide under hers, gently caressing her thigh, and she smiled in response.</p> <p>"I'm really glad you called me." He glanced down to where their mouths were meeting, then back up at her smiling face.</p> <p>"Why thank you, Tanisha," he said. "I guess I kind of liked how you came to know me."</p> <p>"Oh...I suppose," she replied, returning his smile. "And...this...was not just a simple greeting. It's nice to see you in such good spirits."</p> <p>"How did you know my name?" he asked.</p> <p>"I knew someone who happened to own a pool out here."</p> <p>"A pool? Really? And how?"</p> <p>"It's my dad's pool. I was visiting him here on vacation this summer."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Yup," Tanisha replied. "I know he wouldn't mind us...but, for heaven sake...you should come visit him sometime. I can see the look in his eyes, all the way down here. And..."</p> <p>He paused briefly and then asked, "What are you looking for in a girl, then?"</p> <p>"I mean, I've been with a lot of girls before," Tanisha admitted. "Most of them, too, I guess. I've never really liked it, it's always been just some one else's thing. But, lately I've become a natural."</p> <p>"You know, my dad is just as keen on looking me up as you are. What do you think?"</p> <p>Tanisha took a deep breath and said, "I think I'd appreciate it if you came over one day, to watch me. I was wondering if he'd be interested."</p> <p>Ricky looked at her questioningly.</p> <p>"I could come, right this moment, if you wanted," she said. Her smile got even brighter. "It's been nice talking to you, Ricky. I've never felt more alive, more beautiful, more alive than I do right now," she said with a grin.</p> <p>Ricky nodded in agreement.</p> <p>"I understand if you are going to ask me to...do that," she said, grinning. "But, I wouldn't want to have to look you in the eye and tell you to leave me high and dry."</p> <p>"You have no idea," he said. "I'm actually looking forward to it. I've never been here, but...just thinking about the pool. It's just so...beautiful. I can't believe how much I'm enjoying it."</p> <p>"It's all right," Tanisha assured him. "You don't mind if I come to watch over you, right?"</p> <p>"I guess you're right," he said, giving her a sweet grin.</p> <p>He started toward the door. "Tanisha, I think I'm going to have to do that again," he added. "I think it's kind of crazy just sitting here. You're the whole city, and we have electricity. I don't know. I'm not too comfortable right now."</p> <p>"Why?" she asked. "Because I think it's just a little strange, that's all."</p> <p>"I've had this dream where I'm naked in your arms," he confessed. "I just..."</p> <p>"I know," she said, grinning. "And this is one of those dreams where we're naked and you're just a stranger. And, I mean really naked," she said, looking down for a second at the water. "I'd be a thousand miles away, just you and me," she added. "I just..."</p> <p>Ricky couldn't decide if he wanted to get up and go there, or take off right there in her presence. The thought crossed his mind as he walked toward the door. It sounded like a little, but it was probably a lot more than that. He had to admit, in that moment he felt much better about himself, even when she was the cause of all these things? He didn't really do anything to make her feel better than she already was.</p> <p>It wasn't that Ricky couldn't do anything...He just didn't think Tanisha would like him. If anything it made him feel like he was someone's first date. But, he wasn'tâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
