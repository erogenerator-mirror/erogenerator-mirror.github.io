The last cock for a while in my young life. My first. Even though I always had two, that was all too much for me. The next to last cock I have seen. I had to masturbate in the shower one weekend. It was just after my third or fourth orgasm to remember. That week, however, I had to be able to perform. So I was wearing a strap-on, having already come twice. The next day, I went along wearing the strap on, too. To my amazement, my second cock I had, too, too.</p> <p>Next, in front of my dad's new camera, I had a double dildo in there too. Mom had not yet seen it, nor had Mike, so it was a surprise. It had a little plastic head for the strap on. He had to use it to get it in, or move it about a bit. I had had to use Mike's dildo to get it into my butt, so it was easy.</p> <p>The last cock, and the most unexpected, was my boyfriend's cock. The feeling was indescribable. We both came.</p> <p>I would like to say that I masturbated many times that weekâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
