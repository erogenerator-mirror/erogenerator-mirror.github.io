Why don't you get up a moment. We have to speak with the Director and make sure you have a good explanation for the problem," the nurse said and left the room.</p> <p>She came back with her phone with an app on it for the receptionist and they spoke.</p> <p>"This is Samantha," Samantha said. "I've got a feeling Mr. Jackson will be wondering who is fucking me. He knows how many girls I'm with in the States and that's just what he's going to be pissed off about. So you gotta go and get him the fuck away from that asshole."</p> <p>She turned around and winked at me.</p> <p>"Mr. Jackson! He's on his way so I'd better get on my hands and knees while I go get him."</p> <p>"Wait!" I said. "Did you tell the nurse how you met? What the fuck is going on with your old man."</p> <p>She looked back at me.</p> <p>"Samantha, I got it."</p> <p>"No! No, let me explain. It's a deal. There's nobody left on earth who we're fucking and neither is Mr. Jackson."</p> <p>She smiled and said, "I was there. You don't have to tell me what goes on with your people anymore."</p> <p>"Oh, I know!" I said, "What are you doing coming to my doctor to have a talk with him? You got married with his permission."</p> <p>"No!" She said, "It's not like that. He's your father's boss and that's the way of the world. He's always been nice to you, always treated you just like your father. He'll be back by tomorrow night to take you to bed. You'll see, you'll be just like him. He'll tell you that it's been the best sex he's ever gotten and you won't be sorry."</p> <p>I was stunned.</p> <p>"Come on," she said, "It does have its benefits. It won't be any worse than it is for me. Besides he's your new boss."</p> <p>I didn't say anything. I looked over at her and she smiled and reached for my hand again.</p> <p>"Go on. I'll get him. We can talk when he gets here."</p> <p>She looked up at me.</p> <p>"Samantha, I'm so sorry," I said, "I don't know if what the world's gonna do."</p> <p>"I don't care, I get that all the time."</p> <p>I shook her hand again. She grinned.</p> <p>"Thank you," she smiled, "For not just letting you fuck me, but letting me help you out. It does make me so happy..."</p> <p>She kissed me and then her voice softened and more confident.</p> <p>"Please, don't be mad at her."</p> <p>"She's right."</p> <p>"Why does it even matter?"</p> <p>She sighed.</p> <p>"Because she's not my best friend. It's more like a relationship, but you don't just fuck her, you're their doctor. I don't care if she is the nurse that is fucking me right in front of you..."</p> <p>She sighed again and looked down at my hand on her belly.</p> <p>"She doesn't see it that way. Besides, if your father's boss is your father, then I won't ever have to fuck him for him."</p> <p>"Please don't make her feel the way you do. He'll hurt her."</p> <p>She laughed and hugged me back, then she got up and hugged my head.</p> <p>"Look at me," she whispered, "I've seen what it's like to have someone who's your father. I could have cared less about how things are between you and your father and how you feel."</p> <p>"I wouldn't feel right if I did," I said and she gave me an evil smile.</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"Because I care about my best friend and I don't think she would mind if I fucked her. And that makes me even happier!"</p> <p>I hugged her. I did. I loved her. Not just to have her in my bed, but more so just so that she could enjoy the experience.</p> <p>"You're a romantic!" she said and then she giggled like a teenager. "My hero, you're a romantic."</p> <p>I laughed back and felt her body shiver under my touch, before she was back down on her knees and the nurse came back into the room.</p> <p>"Samantha, are you all right?" I asked, as I got up and left.</p> <p>"Mr. Jackson, the doctor will have the Director come up soon. I'm sorry Sam, but I'm going back to my bed. And I want to apologizeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
