In the past he only ever called her his girlfriend and nothing else ever came off to his liking. But right then he couldn't resist saying, "I love you a lot."</p> <p>"I love you too, Dave," she said.</p> <p>They hung up and turned towards each other - for the first time since they'd talked they began to kiss - and slowly got into bed. Their lips barely touched; their bodies felt a little warm and heavy. There was no rush but just tender kissing. Dave held her close and started to feel her body with his hands. It felt wonderful - she was perfect to him.</p> <p>She was kissing him back with the same intensity and as he slowly moved his cock against her he could feel himself getting more and more aroused and was starting to get ready to cum. What could she possibly do for him that didn't involve fucking now he wondered.</p> <p>At the same time she was pulling herself off him and then slowly going down his body and feeling it while tasting him. Her tongue was now going under his balls and licking his hole. He could feel herself building up to a climax so he was surprised when his balls began to pump his juices into her mouth. She was obviously excited and he couldn't wait to get his on-and-off again.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum - fuck me," he pleaded as he felt himself ready to finish. She didn't stop what she was doing and began lightly licking his balls and stroking his now very full cock. The whole time she gently pulled on his balls and felt him begin to get even harder.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah!" she said as she felt him. Her lips moved up his body and with his cock still in her mouth she took it right down to the root and started to swallow as he began to ejaculate.</p> <p>Dave had heard about blowjobs but never had he actually touched his own cock.</p> <p>Even then it had always been with his girlfriend, but it never occurred to him to let her suck him for him. Then as he was cumming he suddenly realized it was really good - just good. He really thought - had never been with a girl before - had never even seen the end of a blowjob like this, but that was before. The cum was just so good to taste and feel. His cock twitched every time he would try to swallow a little but the taste was even better than the texture. It started to slide down her throat and the feeling really made her come alive, but when he started to cum she quickly pulled it out and kissed him some more.</p> <p>"Are you ready to go again?" she asked.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah," he replied as he kissed her again and started to get up.</p> <p>"Where did you cum?" She asked as she stood up and held him close once again.</p> <p>"All on my dick," he answered.</p> <p>"Oh, I see!" she said. "I guess I made a little noise because he had a big load down his throat."</p> <p>She then reached for a condom and pulled him on.</p> <p>"Here," she said. "Here's the best way to finish for me."</p> <p>She turned around and got down on all fours with her eyes closed and waited for him. He climbed on top of her and pushed his cock deep into her vagina. He had already got very excited but as he pushed forward he could feel her starting to get weak and she couldn't wait much longer. He was fucking her with all he was worth and he knew just when she was about to begin to come again that he was about to cum himself so he pulled out and grabbed her hips. "Oh, yes! Oh, god, that feels so good!" she said as he began to cum. "Oh, I'm coming!"</p> <p>As soon as he felt the warm, salty warmth of his orgasm he started to get hard again. He couldn't contain himself any longer. His second load had really made it all worthwhile. He felt like the last drop of his life gone forever into his beautiful girlfriend's vagina. He kept fucking her as long as he could until he couldn't do it any more and then he collapsed on her back.</p> <p>"Mmm," she moaned. "That was good."</p> <p>"I never thought I could love you enough to just do it like that," Dave added.</p> <p>"I didn't either for awhile. It was kind of hard to do when you were just fucking around."</p> <p>"It was worth it," he said.</p> <p>"Now, I want you to fuck me in the ass." She said as she raised her ass so he could slide his cock into her again.</p> <p>"Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
