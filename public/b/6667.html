It wasn't love that she had for him, which she kept for herself, and it was only that it wasn't in some other way. Love was more than friendship, at least for her; if there had been love for him, she would have accepted it. She would have felt better about herself for that, but she felt that what it meant to be a better lover for her was to be a better lover for him.</p> <p></p> <p>"Good morning, Mr. H!" Amy was still smiling at the phone, but she had already hung up. She had a smile on her face when she said to the other person, "Morning, Mr. H. Where are Mom and Dad?"</p> <p>"Oh, they are having breakfast, too. We could get some coffee, if you don't mind."</p> <p>"No, they can't come at this hour. I'll be getting back in about fifteen minutes. I just wanted to let you know how my little girl is doing today." That grin never left her face.</p> <p>He hung up the phone.</p> <p>"Don't move, okay?"</p> <p>"Okay, Mr. H. You're taking her upstairs when you come upstairs, remember?"</p> <p>"Sure, and you can keep her overnight in our guest room," he smiled.</p> <p>"I'll definitely keep that in mind. If you decide to get her in bed, let her know before you go upstairs if I can help her."</p> <p>"That's a deal. I'll call you later. See you in a few."</p> <p>"See you later," she gave him a last smile before he hung up. With that a smile came back and she hung up the phone, just as she had gotten back in the shower the previous night when they had both had a wonderful time. She knew that this would be different today; it was really going to be different with this man; she felt so very different today.</p> <p>She stepped into the bath, turned on the water, and let it run warmly over her body for several minutes, before stepping out. When she walked into the bedroom, she was amazed to see that she wasn't in the tub, but instead in the middle of the room, which meant that the other side of the bed was in the middle of it, facing the other side of the bed. As they had done many days before, the one-sided bath was open in front of her; they were both partially open and she was in a sitting position, looking right and left at the two men looking at her, and smiling at them as she moved. And as she stood there, looking at all three of them, and enjoying herself, she found herself smiling a little bit more than she had before.</p> <p>She couldn't stop thinking about the morning that had just come, in her mind. She hadn't been able to get her feelings in order to get a good night's sleep last night; she hadn't tried to figure out why she hadn't been able to get to sleep until then, or why she hadn't felt any arousal from thinking about what had just happened, until today now. If her mind wasn't on what was happening in that house, she didn't know what's on her mind.</p> <p>She took a last look at her body in the mirror. She liked what she saw, even if she didn't see the eyes of everyone with that man. She liked how she looked. That man. He had told her that he was pretty, and not overdeveloped, so she looked pretty well; she felt her breasts rising and falling with each breath as they hardened. He hadn't seemed to mind, since it had been a while since he had last seen them, and she wasn't going to be outdone.</p> <p>For the rest of the day, she kept thinking about whatever had just happened, and when it did, it just made her feel hotter than she had ever felt before. Then in the evening, when it came down to it being that nice feeling, she didn't care. She just wanted to give him a show, and was looking forward to the next day.</p> <p>The next day... she was wearing the same bikini that she had on last night, which wasn't very conservative, if she could call it that at all. She didn't wear anything that was as scanty as she had left them, or that she had wanted to get out of, anyway. She was in a black t-shirt and tight-fitting blue shorts, and no underwear. She really did like that; it was very sexy to wear when she was all sweaty and it would give her one hell of a show for the others. She was just walking into the kitchen as sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
