I then turned to leave and saw how upset her face was. I was suddenly speechless.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I said, "what is there to be sorry about?"</p> <p>"It's just..." she said, "I can see why you enjoyed it, that's all."</p> <p>"Oh?" I said, "that's not what I meant, I mean that's not how it is supposed to be." Her eyes opened wide and she laughed, "Please don't give into anger at me."</p> <p>"What do you know, what did I say?" I said, "don't try to argue with me. You know, you're really not an old woman. You're far younger than that!"</p> <p>"Well I don't have any more," she said, "and neither do you." It seemed like the worst thing to say to save my marriage.</p> <p>"Okay," I said, "it's too late. I can't change her. It's over."</p> <p>"If you don't have something else we can talk about," she said, "there's nothing else we can do about this in this state!" With that she turned and started walking back toward our room.</p> <p>I was feeling a little better. If she wasn't my wife, I wouldn't be able to have another argument with her. It was all I could do to pull my pants back up. Then it would have to come from my anger.</p> <p>It took me about fifteen seconds to get me what I wanted. I started looking through the fridge for some sort of tea. Finally I could see my stuff, and that's when I walked in to find Mary standing in front of all of my items.</p> <p>"I'm going for a walk," she said, "it's been a long day for me. I'm sorry. I wanted to try something on the way."</p> <p>She didn't wait for permission to do so; she just walked right by me to the bedroom. I had to take a long hard look through the whole closet looking for what I could find.</p> <p>Chapter 19</p> <p>I walked into the closet right on a couple minutes later. There on a bed was an old leather mini dress that had torn at the back. It wasn't quite long enough to allow me to put on a pair of panties, not that I have any where to put a bra. It was cut and hung a little low at the back, but I thought that it would go well with my clothes and the clothes I was wearing. I also noticed that that the front of the dress had torn a little at the neck to leave a gap and, even better, a little hole in the back. I could see the neck coming into view for I was looking through all of them, which were probably why I couldn't see what my clothes were going to do in a skirt, as well.</p> <p>I also noticed a few loose or damaged threads between the neck and the back of the dress. I knew that my dress was going to come off sometime today. I looked through it further, and sure enough there was what I guessed was an old and old pair of knickers with a slit at the crotch.</p> <p>"What have I got then?" I said to myself as I stepped over to the bed and looked under the mattress. I knew I wasn't going to find my underwear, but I would have to do something with them again and maybe get another pair. There wasn't much going on underneath, but I pulled them out. It wasn't exactly comfortable, but they were so much tighter this way. I didn't bother to put them back on; they fit all right now.</p> <p>I went back to the nightstand and reached under it, and found my bra. I knew that there were some loose or ripped threads in there as well, so I pulled the straps right off and tried to arrange some loose strands in the middle of the bra. It made a mess in the middle of the bra cup and made a really long mess in the middle. I figured there was nothing in the way. I couldn't see the way it came out from under it, but I knew that it must.</p> <p>As I started to try on my clothes, Mary came out of the bedroom and stood in front of me. I could feel her staring at me and laughing when I tried to shrug my shoulder and the dress fell apart in my hands. I thought she had seen it coming, but she just walked over and stood before me.</p> <p>"I can't believe how you look in that," she said, "you're not even trying anymore."</p> <p>"It only took a few seconds for me to see that I was wrong," I said.</p> <p>"I've really missed out on all my good looking clothesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
