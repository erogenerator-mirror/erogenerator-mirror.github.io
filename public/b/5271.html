I asked, raising my hands to his chest to caress his skin again. He grabbed my hands and looked at me and kissed my cheek "You are in my dream." He smiled and pulled my hands from his chest and kissed them. He lifted me up and put me on the bed, gently rolling me onto my back. He moved his lips to my neck and shoulders again, moving to me slowly. He nibbled on my collarbone, down to my chest and along my stomach. I reached up and grabbed his hips, holding him close and stroking his back. "Mmmmm. You're so wet baby, I'm going to have to take care of you." I said, running my fingers along his thighs as he turned to kiss me again.</p> <p>He lifted me up slightly and slipped my robe off, tossing it on the chair to come open. He slid up my body to my nipples, biting, sucking and biting them, making my moans deep and long. He kissed his way down my body, never touching my lips.</p> <p>"You're a dream come true." I whispered through his lips.</p> <p>"Oh, yes I've had my heart set on this."</p> <p>He sucked on both of them as he slid himself between my thighs and plunged himself into me. I wrapped my legs around his body, holding him close as he pounded his cock into me. He was deep inside me and the sound of our moans and grunts filled the room. He pulled himself out of me a few times and then pressed himself back in, slamming himself back into me the full length of the bed. I felt his pubic hair tickling my clit, pulling me along along and against him as he moved us.</p> <p>He looked up at me and smiled.</p> <p>"You have beautiful breasts." he said to me "They look so sexy against this sheet; you're just like your mother; sexy and wanton and desirable.</p> <p>He grabbed a towel and threw it on the bed and then leaned down to lick my nipples once more before standing up and kissing me again. He lay down beside me and pulled me to him again, wrapping his arms around my waist and pulling me tight.</p> <p>"I want you." he said to me.</p> <p>I could only say that he did and felt his hands slide between us. He placed himself between my legs and stroked himself up and down against my pussy, feeling the wetness that he had felt between me for hours and hours. He slid down to the side of me and whispered in my ear "What are you thinking?"</p> <p>"I'm dreaming of something different tonight."</p> <p>"What is that?"</p> <p>"We are in my dream, not here, it's not very private."</p> <p>"Is this what you want? You're going to be my woman tonight." He stroked his fingers against my pussy for a moment and leaned over and kissed me, running his tongue over my lips again.</p> <p>"No, no." I said, "No, no foreplay." I was going to tell him right then, no time like the present. I wrapped my arms around his neck and leaned into him.</p> <p>"You're my woman." he said, running one finger across my breast and teasing my nipple. I rolled over and he grabbed me, rolling around, pulling our bodies together as he rolled. He had moved his body back and forth on top of mine as he sucked my nipple, moving his tongue over it and kissing me, and I felt his hand go between us. He slid his fingers into my slick pussy, finding my g-spot and stroking it gently.</p> <p>"I'm dreaming again, I think to myself." The feeling of his fingers moving over my sensitive spot.</p> <p>"Please do." he whispered in my ear, "Make me feel good, baby. Just let go. Feel me push into you. That's it. Oh fuck, feel me move inside of you. Feel me fucking your pussy, feeling you open for me, just let go. Yeah that's it." I felt a warm pressure growing on me and his body was sliding up and down my body. I wrapped my legs around him, pulling him in tighter and feeling the warmth moving up through my pussy. He started feeling me up in ways I didn't know would ever feel good.</p> <p>"Oh god, I'm going to cum," I told him as he thrust harder into me. I could feel myself tightening around him, feeling him pulsing against my body. He started cumming and I felt him fill me deeper than before, filling me with warmth. We lay there for a moment, and he slid out of me. He lay down next to me and we held each other. I turned to face him and he reached for my mouth. I leaned forward to kiss him and he took myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
