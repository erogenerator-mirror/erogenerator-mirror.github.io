"We should have done this a long time ago," he remarked as he returned with towels. "I'm sorry your parents might think you're a slut, but it just happens to work with me."</p> <p>She was a very attractive girl and a couple years older than he was. But she probably wouldn't have made much of an impression on her boyfriend.</p> <p>"Don't worry about it," he said. "I'm not saying I can't talk to you all the time. But let's not talk about it now," he added, reaching out and taking her hand, which she returned. He did, however, hold it.</p> <p>"What are your names, and what's your name..." she started to ask.</p> <p>"I'm Jason by the way." He handed it over to her. It had a lot of possibilities for her, he thought. He felt that it might actually be a safe relationship for them.</p> <p>"I'm Amber." It came out a bit odd for them.</p> <p>"It's a long story." Jason asked. "And it will take more than a drink to explain." But Amber and Amber still seemed at ease talking like that, and he realized they hadn't actually planned to meet. But he couldn't have pulled that off. His mind was whirling through possibilities for what they were going to be doing.</p> <p>"How would we do that?" she asked.</p> <p>"We need to go out, if you know what I mean." He said. Amber nodded. There might as well be something there to tell her.</p> <p>Jason and Amber headed home. He went into the kitchen and grabbed two beer bottles, handing one to Amber and then taking one to his girlfriend. Once they had put their purses back on the counter, he and Amber headed into the living room to make a few phone calls.</p> <p>When they finished his call, he and Amber headed out to sit around the apartment building watching a movie on the television. When they got to the end of the street, they stopped just behind the house.</p> <p>"What do we do?" Jason asked.</p> <p>"It's safe," Amber answered. "If we do nothing else, it will only be when we have something we want to do that won't hurt us. Is that ok, Jason?"</p> <p>"Ya, that's fine. But if you want, to go ahead and do it, then we've gotta ask."</p> <p>Amber laughed. "There are a couple more things you should know."</p> <p>"There's more? Like what?"</p> <p>"Well, like what you said last night?" Amber said, nodding in the direction of Jason's cock. "My boyfriend, the guy, I mean."</p> <p>"Jason, what do you think about a little 'alone time'?"</p> <p>"It seems pretty risky," Jason offered. "But I'm in your hands..."</p> <p>"Is my boyfriend a cock sucker?" Amber laughed, raising her eyebrows. "Let's go get some."</p> <p>"I don't think so," Jason said, laughing as he helped Amber out of the car. "I think a little oral might be helpful, if one ever does a lot more than just put his mouth on it."</p> <p>"I can do that," Amber said, putting her arms around his neck. "But I can't guarantee that it will feel good."</p> <p>"I'll take one more chance on you. We have to find out, or we're going to lose what we have." Jason looked around for any signs of anyone else. There were plenty of people on the street, most of whom were either on their way home or just getting started on something else. He looked back to Amber and grinned.</p> <p>"Well, what do you think...?" Amber laughed.</p> <p>"I like it," Jason replied, giving her a quick squeeze. "Can we just have dinner?"</p> <p>"Sure," Amber agreed. "We'll catch you up on all the info we need to do."</p> <p>Their evening in was spent with Amber telling Jason about some of the girls she'd been seeing. That got Jason really excited. When Amber and Jason started back to the car, they had to stop twice to buy food before leaving. Once back in the restaurant, Amber led the way into the back of the house, where Jason had to take in his luggage. The food, while nice, wasn't very good. It was just a little too much to eat. But the night wasn't as eventful as Jason would have imagined. When Amber's boyfriend left, she felt guilty about how much she had wasted. She'd been really turned on by the experience, but the sex had gotten so much she'd probably had herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
