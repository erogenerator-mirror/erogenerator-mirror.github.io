This was one of the first time he'd actually used the "F" word in real life. It sounded very...sadistic...and I didn't know what to say, or how to say it.</p> <p>"I'm glad you asked me. If you'd like, I'll show you around town in just a few minutes."</p> <p>"No, I need to grab my keys, I'm late." She got up and grabbed her purse. It smelled like a lot of smoke and I knew that whatever she was smoking, he'd recognize it as the smell of a cigarette. She headed out the door and I tried my best to remain calm.</p> <p>The evening dragged on and we both knew that no matter how hard we wanted to spend it, we had to find somewhere to end it.</p> <p>We were almost to campus when we ran into each other. We pulled into an abandoned shopping center to have some last minute items to eat or drink. We got a booth and sat down.</p> <p>"Where do you usually get these clothes?" she asked.</p> <p>"I'm sorry. I hope it wasn't the stuff you're buying for tomorrow?" I said.</p> <p>"No, not really," she replied. We finished the dinner that we'd had already and put on the clothes we'd gotten. I had a feeling that there wasn't going to be any underwear under the clothes, but for now I wanted to see what she had on under the coat.</p> <p>We then had to get to the parking lot to go to our apartment. Not that I really cared, but it was a little more exciting knowing that there would be no underwear that we had to wear.</p> <p>"You really want to go in that car?" I asked. I was curious as to what she had planned after she left so quickly. It didn't take too long before we reached the apartment.</p> <p>"Yes," she replied.</p> <p>"And you're going to come in the car with me?" I asked. I knew that a relationship was probably not in the cards.</p> <p>"Yes!" she exclaimed, obviously excited. We got in the car and she took me to her place. It was a little nicer than mine, but the heat felt good in the car.</p> <p>"I told you that I was nervous about what we would do next," she told me. She was still wearing the coat that I'd brought her and she made no attempt to close the coat as our little encounter continued. She was also wearing the shoes I'd bought her so we could see for ourselves. "I just wanted to see if you were interested. I had a feeling you would be, especially considering how you looked when I saw you dressed up for this," she said, smiling now. I was getting really horny, just from seeing that sexy outfit on her.</p> <p>The place smelled good and we soon found ourselves sitting at a picnic table enjoying a good meal and talking about everything that ever happened. After our meal we decided to watch a video so to speak. We decided we would watch a porno, which I hoped that she would like. It started off at an average movie, where the character had no idea what was going to happen.</p> <p>I told her to look at the scene that I had planned. I went and sat down in one of the couches. I watched as she came out of a closet, put on her jeans, blouse and sweater and sat down again on the couch.</p> <p>She then sat there in the dark topless, which left her nipples that were so big that they poked through the fabric of her top and her breasts looked as if they were pushing outward and out from her body. Her nipples were pointing slightly upward from their large areolas with a little pink nub on top. I could see that she was breathing a little heavier and when she saw me watching her, she immediately crossed her legs and her knee's moved slightly forward as her knee's moved a little.</p> <p>It occurred to me then that she hadn't worn a bra, which meant that whatever was underneath her coat was there. It seemed that she wasn't wearing one of the many bras she had. She looked good enough that way. The whole time as we watched, while enjoying the movie, her hand never moved from her lap and she just leaned back with her leg's up. Her face was turning red as she did so. Her breasts were pointing downward with their large, soft pink aureoles and her nipples were as hard as rocks. They were probably about a half-inch long with a small pink areola at the tops of those lovely areolas.</p> <p>After only a few minutes, I saw her breathing more deeply as she began to stroke her hand up and down her leg's to her knee's. Then all the way up until very little wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
