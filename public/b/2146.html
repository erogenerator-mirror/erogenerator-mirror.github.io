'That's sweet. You've got a really sexy body, sweetie."</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess some girls really love to get that way, huh?"</p> <p>She gave him another seductive look, then added in a sultry purr. "I knew right away that you would, because you are gorgeous." He kissed her again, and she ground her hips into him.</p> <p>She started to undulate back and forth over him.</p> <p>"Mm," he started, trying to match the pace of her humping his cock with his humping hers. His hand was on her breasts again, kneading them hard to her body. "Oh, baby. Oh, God. So hard." She started working her hips faster. He reached down and started to play with her hardening nipples now, rolling them between his fingers. "You feel so good, sweetie. It feels so good to have your warm, wet body touching mine..."</p> <p>"Yes, baby, I like your big, hard cock..." Their eyes locked and seemed to stay locked on one another for a long time.</p> <p>"I love fucking you, baby," he managed to say.</p> <p>"Well, I'll admit to feeling the same way," she replied, grinding harder against him. And now she was humping back against him, too. Their hips slapped again and again as she bounced up and down.</p> <p>"Oh, shit! Oh, God. I'm gonna cum!" he felt her body tense up, the muscles in her thighs and abdomen tighten up...</p> <p>"Yes!" she moaned as she slammed down hard onto him and held him there. He could see her juices gushing from inside her as she rode him. The combination of her climax and his cock pumping into her was too much for him to handle any more.</p> <p>He felt her pussy clench down so hard on him and he came too... His cock exploded and his cream filled and spilled inside her.</p> <p>He thought, I was right, she was still going strong, but she still was milking him with her muscles.</p> <p>She just let the sensations of being so powerfully held and held and held it happen.</p> <p>She rested a moment on him, and they rested and rested...</p> <p>"Did you cum?" he asked.</p> <p>She nodded. "Just a 'hmmm'..."</p> <p>"Hm? Mm-hmm," he agreed. "Hm-hmm! I think your nipples might have cum on my cock."</p> <p>"Mm, it was a lovely surprise," she replied. "Now you need to come back to me, sweetie, I mean." He was starting to get tired again, so she put one arm back around his waist and began kissing him. "I'd love to make love with you again, sweetie, I really do. But I'm off work for a while. How about we save that 'cuddles' thing for tomorrow when you get home?"</p> <p>"Yes," he answered.</p> <p>They kissed and cuddled, each feeling their bodies go back to normal after that.</p> <p>They fell asleep in each other's arms.</p> <p>In the morning, they made their arrangements, and she flew her husband off. Their lives changed forever; they had new friends, new lives, new lives...</p> <p>-</p> <p>They sat in front of her car waiting to get back until she was back at home.</p> <p>"Baby, let's get this thing loaded right this minute," she said as she opened the glove compartment.</p> <p>"Yes, sweetie, let's finish this up now."</p> <p>She took a roll of paper towels from her bag, and started to wash her hands.</p> <p>"Why don't you shower while we put this up?" She handed him the towel, then pulled him up by his t-shirt to wash him off.</p> <p>"Ohhh! Mm, yes, I can do it," he said, smiling at her.</p> <p>He started to clean him up, and by the time they had his shirt back on, he was starting to feel refreshed.</p> <p>She handed him her wet wash cloth again and wiped his cum as well. "Humm, let's get this one back," he said, standing up and pulling his t-shirt up, helping rinse the water out of his hair.</p> <p>"Hmmm, I'm liking this 'we'll see' thing," she said, taking the wash cloth and washing her hands off too.</p> <p>While they were both finishing up, they were kissing again, and they got up to go to the laundry room. They had to get all his clothesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
