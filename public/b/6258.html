He pulled her hand around to the front and lifted her chin towards his and looked into her eyes as she slowly kissed him. He was getting hard again. He was so turned on. It wasn't over yet.</p> <p>She reached round and unfastened his pants and slid her hand up his thigh, sliding further into his underwear. Her head was in the way and he gently pushed her away to kneel at the edge of the chaise. He took his dick in his hand and began rubbing over her face. He wasn't going to cum this time. He had to keep this feeling going all night.</p> <p>"Will you suck me?" he said, pulling her up and onto his knees. He looked down at her as she leaned back to lie down. He wanted to kiss and lick her now, he wanted to fuck her until he heard he screamed when he came, but he wanted to make her beg for him. Then she looked up at him, surprised by his sudden boldness. He was very good at giving a guy head. He wasn't all that thick at the base, but he could stretch her out just right. He knew they both made her orgasm with his tongue, and he always tried. But this time, he was sure she would ask for more. He gently lowered her down to her back, kissed and licked her body, moving down to her neck, which he found out later was shaved, just a short wispy fuzz at the top of her cleavage. The skin on her nipples was so soft, almost like peach fuzz. He slid his tongue back up to her ear and she shivered, moaning softly. He moved his hand to her thigh and slowly inched slowly upwards the length of her body until his fingers were hovering just above her pubic hair. He reached her crotch and cupped it, her lips were wet and ready, she was so warm and wet. He felt her opening up, opening her to be taken.</p> <p>"Please," he asked, "I'll do anything you want."</p> <p>"It's a promise," she said, "Let me have my pussy."</p> <p>He kissed her passionately, pushing his tongue into her mouth, as he moved one hand to her breast and tweaked her nipple as he pushed his other hand inside her jeans. She was so wet she took his forefinger into her mouth and sucked hard on his finger as she felt him rub over her clitoris. The pressure in his hand was building to a rhythm, and she knew he would be fucking her with his finger very soon. She moved closer to the edge of the chaise as his finger moved around her, feeling the slick warmth, the tightness. Her breathing quickened as he felt her getting wetter and wetter. She was moaning around his finger and she arched her head backwards as he rubbed his finger around the rim of her pussy, dipping just a little and back up the hole again. She was coming, she could feel the warmth spreading through her, spreading out from there down her legs. He moved his finger back to her clitoris, he rubbed her clit just the right way, just the right amount, and she exploded in his mouth. She bit him hard on the back of his neck as he felt her vagina contract, pulsing and contracting around his hand. She was coming again, very quickly. Her juices were running down her legs as she came, it was all that mattered to her. He continued to finger her as she came, not moving, not touching her, nothing but her hand on his body, his hand against hers, pressing her into wherever she wanted to go, over and over again. She couldn't be far from him, she could feel him there, his hardness rubbing hers as he moved around the lounge to lie down. She was on her knees, almost on top.</p> <p>He felt dizzy, and he got up from the chaise to take her. He put his hand on her body, feeling the warm liquid of her pussy juice, his finger on her clitoris, touching that perfect spot. He felt his dick straining as he pressed it up to the very tip of his shaft.</p> <p>"Oh," she said as his hot hot penis slid up her, pressing against her cervix, feeling her shudder as he filled her once again, spreading her open and driving his penis up her. His whole body was on top of hers, his dick pressed against her pussy. He began fucking her, slowly, carefully, wanting her to last as long as she wanted to, wanting to feel the intensity, the speed and power of the penetration. He felt her nails digging into his back as his thrusts deepened, pushing his hips forwards as he pushed back into her. She was panting, moaning quietly, the feel of his pubic hair on her hips and the wetness ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
