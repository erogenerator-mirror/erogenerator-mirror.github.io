I decided to follow as well and walked along the end of the street.</p> <p>I stopped at a red light, a dark corner, and waited. I was very relieved to hear the red light turn green. The light changed colors and the street began to brighten. It was then I felt a strong hand pull my face down to the hood of my car. "Look," said Tony, "I'm not exactly in Kansas anymore. We'll have time for me as soon as I come home. I love you, I really do so."</p> <p>I didn't say anything. I felt his hands go around my shoulders and he pulled me to the parking garage. He pulled the hood up as well as the doors, "Drive safe," he whispered.</p> <p>It had been a long and lonely time since I'd seen a white guy and for the first time ever I had trouble figuring that they made out in their car in the dark. I didn't even want to think about it. I was in a strange land and I was determined to enjoy it. Tony seemed to sense this and he lifted me off the hood and said "Thank you."</p> <p>I got up and got my bag. As I drove towards the garage I felt a hand on the back. I turned around in my seat. Two sets of arms went around my chest. "Hello, Mr. Johnson."</p> <p>"Hey, what're you doing?" I asked. We were in the driveway of a house in the suburbs.</p> <p>"I wanted to talk to my old friend. Maybe it was better not to talk to him at this point." He said, "Are you ready for your friend?"</p> <p>"Yes, he said that I was about ready to call him," I said. I sat there looking out the windows at the lights. The garage had no doors to speak of. He reached for my chin with both hands. I looked up at him. "I'm glad you had some time. Maybe we could do this again." I said quietly then got on my first word.</p> <p>"I'll think of something, I'll be around to answer any questions you might have," he said with a grin pulling me with him as we walked upstairs.</p> <p>I stopped him and said, "I have a confession to make myself," I looked at him shyly. "I got so excited at watching you," I felt the blood rush back into my mouth, "I'm sorry, but I have to tell you."</p> <p>He pulled me into his arms and kissed me. His hands were on my ass cheeks. He ran his hand up my skirt to my pussy and his fingers slid over my panties. "I'm so sorry, but this excites me just as it does you," he whispered.</p> <p>"I have always wondered what it would be like to be with a bigger man, with you," I said as I looked at his large cock through his pants.</p> <p>"No, we can't do that, we just can't," he said as he broke away as quickly as he came. "You don't have any choice, Mr. Johnson. I can feel your love for me." He turned and kissed me again, "I just want to be sure you're the one. Are you?"</p> <p>"Well, I'd like to, to be the one to make your acquaintance," I said.</p> <p>Tony looked at me as he said this and I had visions of him fucking me. "Yes?" he asked in a puzzled voice.</p> <p>"Well," I smiled as I turned to him.</p> <p>Tony moved towards me and as I stood in front of him he reached down and pulled down my panties. He lifted me onto the kitchen counter. His cock was huge and I was so wet I thought I might go crazy if he didn't fuck me first. Tony lifted me and spread me on the kitchen counter. He pushed me back until I was lying on the edge then lifted me until I was at the edge of the counter on my shoulders. He pulled my skirt up to my hips and ran his cock up and down between my legs.</p> <p>"I want to make that," he started to say as he slid his cockhead up and down between my legs. "I just have to make sure," he teased.</p> <p>Suddenly he slammed his cock into me. "Fuck me, daddy," I whispered. I felt the cock go deep inside me and it felt so good. My pussy contracted around him as he plunged in and out. My legs went around his waist as his cock slid in and out of me. He pulled out slowly and my body clenched as his cock head slipped back into me.</p> <p>"Yes, fuck me dadâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
