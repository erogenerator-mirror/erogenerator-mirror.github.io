I wonder if you'll get what we're talking about. This might have been the most memorable sex of my life. I'll never forget it."</p> <p>"That's just an appetizer for what we know is to come," She added. He just smiled and then stood, offering her his hand. She smiled as he pulled her into the kitchen. Their lips met like two melting gum drops; he pulled her close for a deep, passionate kiss and he kissed every inch of her. As the kiss ended, he picked up her and carried her into the master bathroom where they made their first real connection. She let out a deep sigh as her body relaxed into him as he stood in the basin and turned on the shower. The water washed over her shoulders, down across her breasts and finally down to her shaven pussy. The water drenched her, leaving a shiny surface to cover the skin between her legs. He knelt, lifted and spread her legs and stepped up into her. His member came into contact with her pussy lips and then rubbed them back and forth. He kissed and nibbled on her neck, causing her to tremble with anticipation and anticipation. He was right, of course; it was just too damn good. He grabbed her ass and lifted her body up so that they rested right at her cervix.</p> <p>"Oh, my," She whispered, trying to stay as still as possible. He continued to kiss and nibble her neck and shoulders, his fingers now moving under her ass and around her pussy. She could feel the warmth of his large hands as they gently squeezed her cheeks. "You've been a very good girl," he whispered in her ear. The water was running over her; it felt so good. "I want to do things to you that I'm never going to do to you. I want to make you cum, like you always have, but I can't just ram my cock all the way up in you in one blow job. Oh, God, I want that too!"</p> <p>That had been the night the new me was born and now as his fingers explored her pussy, she knew that he would take her there. She had to admit, he was very good looking; she always thought he had that "jerk off" look about them, but never saw it coming.</p> <p>He lifted her up and placed his penis at her opening. "Hold on tight," he said as he entered her with a moan of pleasure. He moved the head of his penis up and down her outer lips and then slowly went inside. She lifted her legs, inviting him in.</p> <p>"Do me doggy-style," she whispered. "I want to feel you inside me." She was very wet this time already and he did not need anymore. The next few minutes was more of exploring than the actual sex. He could feel the walls of her vagina moving along the entirety of his shaft and her tight walls gripping him. She was so tight that he was surprised but it was just as he had hoped. His eyes kept glancing along her body, watching for that elusive eye that seemed to shine right between her legs. She was so beautiful and they both knew it. He was about to be lost to her forever.</p> <p>He lowered her body slightly so that she could rest on his upper thighs. She knew at that point how to do it so it wouldn't become awkward at all. Then he put her legs on his chest and pulled himself fully in. He didn't use any of the toys or anything he had used on her but as his penis filled her and the sensation of his pubic hair tickled her clit she knew that this was his chance to make her cum and she wanted his cum inside her. "Oh, my God," she whispered as she felt him begin to move again. She loved how he held himself deep inside of her; he was a good lover. His hips bucked up, forcing a deeper response. "That feels so good!" she muttered as they both became lost in her passion. They both loved it and they knew that they were going to cum together. And he loved it too.</p> <p>"That's my girl," he declared, as they collapsed onto the wet, cold tile floor.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," she whispered, laying her head on his shoulder, savoring his warmth. "I want to kiss you." She kissed him; not for very long; she wanted that special night to come again. And he had it as well. He slid his arms around her to hold her close, allowing her to move on him. They kissed, he had never kissed anyone that had done this before. They just felt so good. She slowly moved around him, exploring him, making him feel even more special. She let her hand fall to his chest and slowly rub his nipples. He ran his fingers along the length of her spine, watching her goose bumps rise from her skinâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
