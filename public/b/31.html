I didn't think we could do something like that."</p> <p>"Not much. What would you do if just one of us wanted to lick it?" asked Amy.</p> <p>"Well, like you asked, I'd lick some of it while I did, too," said Amy.</p> <p>My cock twitched again at this thought. The thought aroused me even further. I moved closer to Amy and leaned down and kissed her. Our tongues touched as our lips met and our kisses intensified. Soon our tongues were moving together, each trying to share the taste of the other's juices. I could feel my cock rubbing against her belly.</p> <p>"Do you want another taste?" I asked.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah, right there!" screamed my wife.</p> <p>"Just lick me. Just do what feels good to you," she said, trying to pull closer to me.</p> <p>I kissed her and licked her earlobe. Then I moved my lips back to her neck, where her moans of ecstasy increased. I found her cleavage, squeezing her tits while she thrust her chest towards me, making them bounce all the more in my hands. Her nipples were fully erect and looked good enough to stab in the very air. It was just as I imagined her breasts would be. I was now in total control of what was happening.</p> <p>My cock was now fully stiff and pressed against the inside of my pants. It felt wonderful to be with my wife in such close proximity. I moved my mouth back to her neck, kissing lower than she would have liked. Amy's breathing became heavier and louder, a faint smell of sexual excitement in the air. Her hips began to thrust against me, grinding my cock harder in her pelvis. I kissed her face, neck, ears, and finally found her lips. As we kissed and my lips moved from her neck down to her chest, I made my way to her breasts. This time I kissed each nipple through the mesh, making their erect state as hard and excited as I had been before. As I kissed her other breasts and made my way down her torso, I could feel her hips thrusting against my tongue.</p> <p>"Oh! Oh, god!" she cried. "Touch my sex!"</p> <p>I could feel the heat coming from her body, her excitement starting to increase along with mine. I was about to get out of bed and leave her to masturbate when her hips again stopped bucking against my face and made its way down my body. She began moaning as she neared her orgasm.</p> <p>"I'm going to climax any second now," she said quietly. "I can't wait."</p> <p>I moved my hands towards her pussy, where I found it soaked with cum. "Are you ready for me to go down on you again now?" I asked her.</p> <p>She just moaned in response. I could see the muscles in the small of her back and thighs tense as she began to cum again. As she came for the first time, the sensation of her juices dripping onto me and between my legs.</p> <p>"I don't care if we have to rush," she said.</p> <p>"We should be getting home. There's no need for us to hurry. I'm not as wet as you are!"</p> <p>"I guess that means you should take off your panties," she said.</p> <p>"Of course! I'm not going to keep them on. I want you to keep them on while we are in bed."</p> <p>A few seconds later we were back in bed. Amy had her eyes closed as she lay her head upon my shoulder. In the glow of her passion glow, I moved a hand down her body towards her cunt. Soon she was stroking my cock, bringing me closer and closer to another orgasm. I pulled slightly over her clit so I could get near it, where I began to lick her clit. I licked one and then the other with abandon.</p> <p>"Do you like the feel of my tongue?" I asked her.</p> <p>She opened her eyes slightly, and smiled sexily. "Yes! Just like that!"</p> <p>"Well, when you kiss a pussy you do like kissing lips then you feel it too."</p> <p>"But that does look awfully nice."</p> <p>"It looks even better. You do look so pretty laying there like that," I said.</p> <p>"Do you know how wet this makes me?" she asked.</p> <p>"You were going to come already."</p> <p>"I'm so excited right now. I can feel my heart beating hard against my breasts." Amy opened a robe and removed it. Her tits were still heaving and she had a big smile. I could see the glow of her excitement even through her robe. Her clit was still exposed, her pussy juices still wet, forming an even bigger circle around itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
