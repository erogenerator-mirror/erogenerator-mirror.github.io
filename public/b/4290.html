He thought. "Oh, well, well, just keep that thought, okay?" He looked at the table. "How about we pick a time to catch up, and then we can get on with it?" He stood, heading for the door.</p> <p>I was a little nervous, not only from the fact that I'd been to the doctor a couple of times, but also from the anticipation of having him walk in front of me. He was very attractive and fit, and the shirt he was wearing looked even sexier without it. "What about you?" I asked. It had certainly been an erotic day.</p> <p>"I'm sure she'll be pleased to know, so let's set it up. I'll pick the time, so we have no problem." He was almost out the door, and I sat there looking at the clock. "See you in one piece, and maybe we'll see you again sometime, maybe not. And maybe we can chat some more."</p> <p>I had no idea what he meant by "just chat", though, until I saw his back at the door. He was giving me a smile and waving. I didn't have much of a reaction to it, but that's not what I'd been expecting. He'd brought a bottle of wine and had the bottle open on the stool next to it, so he didn't have to stand to walk. He was holding mine the whole time, and I got a good look as he looked over my shoulder.</p> <p>"I need to be going, you see, soon, my mom will be home in a few minutes," he said. He paused at his door and gave me a quick smile. "See you tomorrow then then."</p> <p>As he walked out through the sliding glass door, I saw him leave the room. He was standing at the end of the hallway just beyond the door. I heard him walking down the hallway, and felt myself starting to get wet.</p> <p>The next morning I was up early. I got a shower, got dressed, and called Mark into the office.</p> <p>"So, I heard you two going at it in the bedroom this morning, so I figured you might want to be comfortable and wait." I sat him down at a table and began working my way up some of his work. "So, my mother is home and I guess she's going to have some coffee while I wait for the coffee machine to start up."</p> <p>The coffee machine. I didn't know where things were going. I hadn't even bothered to bring one of those small mugs with me, and I thought for sure I was going to be able to get by without it. And then I noticed this. Mark had been gone a long time, and I hadn't even put the coffee back on yet. I was about to take it back when a noise came from the door. I looked down and saw that he'd been standing at the door, looking at something in the other wall. I leaned back and watched the light come on a little bit as I watched the door open and close, and I felt more and more nervous. I couldn't turn back now, so I turned the lock all the way on and looked back at the wall.</p> <p>"Mark's in there. He's looking at something in my Mom's bedroom and he's being very careful and I hope he's watching it all." I couldn't wait. I opened the door, and his face was already hard and his eyes were locked on the TV. I took off my jacket and threw it over my shoulder, and I felt very naked. I felt as though I was naked in public, and this was turning me on something fierce. I was sure that I was wet as hell, but I was also afraid that the excitement of being on display made things worse. There was no way that I could bring my hands up, but I reached for his shirt and started running my hands over it. He was already naked beneath.</p> <p>"Mark? What are you doing? What's wrong?" My words cut through the air like a knife in my palm as he stood there staring at me. I was surprised to find that he wasn't completely naked. He didn't try to hide it, and I could see that he was even hung better than he had been. I leaned back against his desk, pulled his face down to mine, and kissed him. That kiss was long and hungry, and I could taste the wine in his breath each time. I could feel his hands exploring where he'd been.</p> <p>"It's okay. I'm just having a little fun, too." I kissed him again as my hand found the zipper at the front of his pants. I slid the zipper and his trousers down in one sweep, and then I was surprised to find that Mark had also gone completely naked. His body was well muscled andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
