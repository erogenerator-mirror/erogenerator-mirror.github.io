It'll be a while before I can bring myself to do anything with you. We'll talk more when I'm ready. If I decide not to get out of your way again then..." he stopped, trying to catch his breath.</p> <p>"What is it you want? You're so nice to me. If my parents don't leave me soon I might as well try out for you. I just hope I can come back soon enough to make the most of this day or to be with you."</p> <p>"Well, it's not exactly a plan that I can foresee. I just don't want to go around telling my parents you just got back from your vacation!" With that, he grabbed his shirt and ran out to the house and shut the front door.</p> <p>~~~~~</p> <p>I'm not a big fan of my mom seeing me naked in bed but I didn't mind one bit more in the shower. I'd forgotten that I was still a virgin and it felt amazing. My parents were at the breakfast table and he sat a tray of food and then sat next to me when I walked by. Before long he was sitting right next to me on the bench as he ate his food. After the meal I excused myself to clean up and got dressed. As promised, the rest of the day was a total blur. We talked, flirted and giggled all the time. It was a nice feeling. After the night before, when I decided to tell my dad that I wasn't going to be alone all weekend, we went to bed and I woke up early. After he got up in the morning and I got ready for school, I showered and then went to my room. As I showered I began to think about all these other things. While not a whole lot of thoughts could come out of my head, this time seemed different. More personal. My dad got home from school about lunch time and came to my door. We both gave him a hug and told him how good it felt to have him there. My heart began to race as I realized that I could talk about anything with him and that it was good being with him. I wanted to tell him everything, but I knew if I said the wrong thing it would make everything right between us. He didn't take my eyes off me as he got dressed in his cheerleader outfit. A t-shirt and a pair of shorts that were so tight that he couldn't wear anything underneath. He kissed my forehead and then went back to bed.</p> <p>After an hour or so of thinking about what was happening between him and me, I decided to let go. I wasn't going to be happy talking to him and the whole situation would just get more frustrating with each passing day. I closed my eyes and thought about the past two months and how things had finally gotten a bit better.</p> <p>~~~~~</p> <p>"So do you wanna go back today?" My mother asked him when he stepped out of the room. He still hadn't answered but was nodding his head yes.</p> <p>"Great!" My father said and they went out to their car. My mother was wearing a tank top with a pair of blue jeans that showed off her ass nicely. We had a nice day at school and were able to get a spot in the cheerleading squad and see to our final year.</p> <p>~~~~~</p> <p>"I've got to go and meet our friends at the grocery store." I said to my parents when they came downstairs. "They want to meet with us so after supper we'll go hang out." They wanted to go to watch a movie with me after practice, but I had to go after them to get my stuff.</p> <p>"Oh we'll go hang out with you tomorrow at the gym!" My dad said as he kissed me on my cheek. "Thanks for going with me."</p> <p>"No problem dad!" I was smiling and walking away from him as I walked out the door for the day. My parents just shrugged and headed up the stairs to change. ~~~</p> <p>"Where's mom?" I asked her as I watched them in the rearview mirror. My dad turned around and looked at me, before walking inside.</p> <p>"She's taking my car back to the university. I can't go. You have to be with me at the wedding."</p> <p>I had thought that something like this would happen on the day in front of the church. When he came back out with the car he went through a lot of small talk but never mentioned how he felt about it. I was starting to feel bad that the relationship had gotten stale. I figured that if mom and dad met up or anything that could be resolved, after tonight would be over. My dad just walked out to his car and left me toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
