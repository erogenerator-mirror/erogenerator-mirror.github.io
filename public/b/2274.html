He slipped the tip of her tongue between his lips and then kissed it, his tongue tangling with hers. He pulled away to kiss her again as they lay on the floor.</p> <p>"I love you." He whispered, his words barely audible.</p> <p>"I love you, too, James." She replied.</p> <p>He rose to his feet and held her gently as they kissed. His right knee gently pressed against her lower knee as they kissed. "I love you, Rebecca." He whispered into her ear.</p> <p>"I love you too, James." she agreed, feeling like she had missed something.</p> <p>They remained like that for a while, his hand caressing her back, her breasts and finally, his mouth on hers. They were both ready to cum and James reached down and pressed one of her hands against his cock. He stroked her hand until her fingers met with his swollen member. He gently moved her fingers to his shaft and began to move his hips as he sucked on her nipples. Rebecca moaned as he pulled on them, sucking each hard peak in turn and biting them with his thumb as he squeezed on them. She reached back and grabbed his cock as he slid it between her thighs. As she stroked him, they fucked each other with only their mouths and fingers, moving closer and closer to orgasm. James' mouth was getting rougher with hers, both of them moaning in unison. Reaching behind her, she started to caress his balls with one hand while he kneaded her other breast with the other. Their passion escalated as she felt him swell even more inside her and he moaned with desire.</p> <p>He pulled her into a sitting position on the floor and he knelt between her legs. He held them together and moved her legs down so he could lick her clit. His tongue flicked her clit in little circles while he plunged two fingers inside her and added a third as they fucked her pussy. The sensations that surged through her were more intense and more intense than anything she had ever felt with two cocks inside her. He moved and rocked against her, his tongue swirling her clit and moving in counter clockwise circles as he licked her pussy. As she approached the brink, he felt her entire body shaking as she moaned and shook.</p> <p>Exhausted, he fell to the floor. He held Rebecca's legs for support as they lay there and the warmth from the orgasm pulsed through her body. "Are you ready? Cum for me, darling." he whispered so that no one outside would hear.</p> <p>"Yes, James. I'm cumming, James!" she answered.</p> <p>"I'm going to fill that little hole. I want you to feel as good as possible." he said between clinched teeth.</p> <p>"As long as we can last." she replied, her voice shaky. He lifted her legs and rolled her over onto her back. He moved between her thighs as she guided him. His dick was still sensitive from the earlier love making but the sight of Rebecca's sexy legs wrapped around him and her breasts pressed against his chest caused him to groan as he entered her. They continued to fuck as James grabbed her shoulders, pulling her face to him. He began to pump his dick into her slowly at first, savoring the feeling of being buried inside her with each thrust. He was aware of the sounds of pleasure in the room from downstairs. The sounds of their voices and the sounds of James fucking Rebecca were almost too much to bear and the sight of her body being used and fucking James was too much to handle.</p> <p>James had heard the noise upstairs, a low groan and the sound of Rebecca's moans. He continued to fuck her harder and faster as he kissed her ear, her neck and back, occasionally biting it. The sight of his dick pumping in and out of that tight young pussy of hers drove him over the edge and he began to cum. He felt his hot, thick cum pumping out of his dick and spraying her insides as he moaned and yelled, enjoying the feeling of Rebecca as she fucked him. As his orgasm hit him, his dick jerked inside her with a cry of ecstasy. He collapsed on her as they remained in position.</p> <p>James' dick stopped jerking inside her and he eased it out as it began to soften. "Do you want to keep doing that?" he asked.</p> <p>"I think I might just go for it." she replied.</p> <p>"Good. I think it will be more fun this way." he replied. "There is still something I'd like us to do before we see each other again." he suggested.</p> <p>Rebecca turned around on her knees in the middle of the floor, her back toward him.
