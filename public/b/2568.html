I'm sorry, your schedule changes were a short one but you did a good job."</p> <p>She was already standing and took off her jacket, revealing a pink bra. "Do you like it?"</p> <p>"I love it," he replied sitting at the table.</p> <p>"And you?"</p> <p>"I don't think I'm that much of a dresser so my blouse is a bit more revealing and I like it."</p> <p>"I like it too," she smiled. He reached down and pulled down the straps on her bra. "Are you okay with that?"</p> <p>"You mean you like it?"</p> <p>She took off her blouse and was glad to see that he liked it. "No, I think it's good that you like it. I can't believe you like it."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"No, I mean, you were right to want it. Why can we leave it on?" Her nipples were becoming hard and stiff.</p> <p>"Oh. Well, let's see what happens. Come sit on my lap." He sat down and she sat on his lap. "Now, what's this about what my husband said. He said that if you wanted me to stop seeing him that you needed to see that he is a man."</p> <p>"Does what?"</p> <p>"Does what. He would agree to let me and I wouldn't need a rubber for the weekend."</p> <p>"Who did?"</p> <p>"Oh, a few. I wasn't sure how I felt about having sex with other men. I've been with a couple of married ones and this was different. They were a lot older than me and they were willing." He reached up and took her breast in his hand. "They are soft and heavy and so are yours"</p> <p>"Why don't you call me?"</p> <p>"Is that a request?"</p> <p>"No, I really mean it. I know you like it. It's not that you're shy," she blushed.</p> <p>"What am I agreeing on?"</p> <p>"I don't want to do it. I want to do it with you and I don't want to take it as if you're not as willing to give me it as I think you are."</p> <p>"What do you mean? And I told you, if you do what I say, I'll never ever say no to you."</p> <p>"But, I know you won't. Maybe someday we'll have sex and what if it doesn't work out." His hands were moving up and down her back.</p> <p>"I don't want you to stop." She smiled and closed her eyes. "It's okay if you want to and maybe someday I'll do it so what if it doesn't work out, I'd love to." He pulled the hem of her skirt up. "You won't have to change your mind about doing me. It's been more than six months. Are you ready for more?"</p> <p>"I think we can make a baby if I get you pregnant."</p> <p>"How many times have you wanted me? How many women have you seen with such a big cock? Is my pussy wet and ready?"</p> <p>"Not much," he said. They were both getting close to coming.</p> <p>"And we'll have a baby."</p> <p>"I want you to get me to you, to have me as a partner in your world. I'm not going to be able to look at the two of you and be happy if I lose your baby."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"Do you need me to get you back and if so, what if you decide you're too old for me?"</p> <p>"I think that's the best solution, but if I start sleeping with you and have a baby that's up to you," he joked.</p> <p>She got up and kissed him. "If you're too old for me, please call me and we can get together again."</p> <p>They finished dinner and talked about it. Then he pulled off her panties and sat in the chair, "I like the way you trimmed it this night."</p> <p>"I like it that much," she replied. She started to rub her pussy. "You don't want me to stop doing what you were doing before I thought you had to quit. I love it."</p> <p>"If I stop now, I won't last."</p> <p>She smiled and moved her hand faster until she came. They didn't talk much. He never looked at her face but her eyes told him she was pleased.</p> <p>When they were finished, she asked him to pick up the checkbook. When he walked out the door, he turned to her and grabbed her.
