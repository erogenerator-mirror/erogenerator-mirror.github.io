I asked.</p> <p>"If I'm honest," she said seriously."</p> <p>"You're sure about that?" I asked. "Why are you so interested?"</p> <p>"Because you're very funny," she answered. "I think you're handsome."</p> <p>"So, is this a bad thing?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"But, I don't know. This is your first time. And I don't plan on being gentle with you. Do you think we could go any further than this?"</p> <p>"I don't think so, and I don't think what you're asking is what a man and a woman should do together, and it might be more to my liking," I replied. "I hope we don't have to stop if we decide," she added.</p> <p>"We've never done it in public. Or the bus stop after work. It's very private. We've never had to hide in the office, or even the back row, or the toilet," she added. "But this is so much nicer than any of that other stuff."</p> <p>"Just keep going," I grinned, "and I know you'll enjoy it."</p> <p>"I'm sure we won't feel bad, do you think?" she asked.</p> <p>"I'm sure."</p> <p>"I'm glad you like this," she added, leaning over and kissing my chest, slowly, delicately, and sweetly.</p> <p>"You're sweet," I whispered, and then pulled her up to me and kissed her again.</p> <p>I loved her more and more each day that we spent together. She'd never told me that she loved me more, so it was easy to understand that she really did, and in truth, she was really beautiful, especially in her mind. Even at her age my eyes never stopped looking at her, and I never stopped thinking of her, even when we were out in public having a coffee or two.</p> <p>And of course, I couldn't help thinking of her being older, though still so, too, at 42, but in my mind when I saw her, and how she was being dressed, all I could think of was her. And if they had known we had been seeing each other, they probably would have been angry, because they must have told us.</p> <p>We made love that evening in that room, and as we came downstairs in the morning, before we'd even left the room, there she was, naked, lying across the bed against the pillows, her beautiful, big titties on my stomach, her pussy hair all over it, just a little trimmed, making her pussy seem to be a little more hairless than it was. My mouth dropped to her nipples, and I sucked and nibbled on them and, when I'd sucked them into my mouth, they were like little thumbs, like miniature thumbs, all very soft and little in an odd sort of way.</p> <p>"Mmmmmm," she moaned when I did that, and started to move her body against the side of mine, pulling on her nipples in my mouth. She rolled over and sat up slightly, and reached for me, pulling me into her as she lifted herself up. When we were both on our knees, my cockhead was just at her pussy opening, and I reached down and stroked her hairless mound, her legs, then lowered myself down, just touching her, and she slid all the way down to the root of my cock and up again slowly.</p> <p>We hadn't had intercourse in quite some time, and she was really tight, not like the older women I'd done, of course, but it had felt as though I was about to get her off all at once, and she looked down at me, and grinned at me again.</p> <p>"I hope I can do it," she whispered. "I feel so warm on me like that."</p> <p>"It's alright," I said as I reached around her and ran my hands up and down her body. "I'm really horny myself, and I'm ready to do you."</p> <p>"Really? Have I already?" she laughed. "What would you like me do?"</p> <p>"I'd want you to do something for me," I answered.</p> <p>"I really like what you were doing to me with your tongue."</p> <p>"You did that so well, and you did wonderfully," I said, and we hugged each other tight and let my cock slide down between her legs and press against her slit forâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
