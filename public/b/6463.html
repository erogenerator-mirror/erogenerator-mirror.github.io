I had a few clients on the couch at lunch and one guy wanted to meet with me," I tell him in a low voice.</p> <p>"I don't mind," he assures me, "just like my old friend."</p> <p>My heart beat with my best interest. I would never be able to take him back. I'd love nothing more than to rip off the man he's been seeing.</p> <p>"I've had enough of that stuff, "he says softly, "You have your own life and we can't just stand here talking about it."</p> <p>It's true; we can't just stand here, let the air out of the cage."</p> <p>I'm on my way to him in one swift swing and he is right behind me, his hand on my shoulder guiding my body to him.
