"I guess we're all having a good time."</p> <p>The smile of an angel and the look of a hunter was alluring in its own right as it took her hand up to pull him to another direction. She had this wicked look on her face, one that had me wondering if she was going to seduce him and she was. Her eyes flashed, a seductive fire I'd never seen from her before. "Would you come into the dining room with me one day, Jason?" she asked sweetly. I couldn't believe she actually wanted that as her mind made the suggestion.</p> <p>"Well, I just want to apologize for earlier, so you can apologize after your talk, sweetheart. But, if you don't want to be responsible like that again in case of some unfortunate event, that's okay. So, let's just not do anything more tonight until..." I trailed off. "I see."</p> <p>"Yeah, but if anything happens, I really, really mean it. And it shouldn't be for the same reasons." She continued her sweet banter with a touch of irony that took her breath away.</p> <p>We continued our discussion, our hands meeting more and more frequently in the days that followed. I couldn't even describe to her the things that were going on at work. All I knew about Jason was the way she was going to flirt and talk with him. It was as if she had no idea he was there, and he was the reason she was smiling so widely now. But, what Jason had done when she was talking with a guy was a combination of nothing that had happened before. That and, his knowing how she would react on how I felt about them, was one of her greatest traits.</p> <p>"Well," I replied with a little bit of a sigh. "So, I won't go all the way just here with your face in my pocket tonight."</p> <p>"Oh," she said with a sweet smile of my own. "Can't you stay here with me after this?" Before I could answer I felt her warm hand slip into my lap and grip my hardening cock. It didn't give me the heart-to-heart talk of the day. I couldn't believe how easily my thoughts had been erased by just thinking about her. All I could do was wrap my mind around her like it would protect me if she ever approached me.</p> <p>"I wouldn't want you to feel that way, honey. You deserve a good man, a nice guy." She said, her hand squeezing me through my jeans. It was one of the most memorable evenings I could remember in some time. All the girls had been in the same room when she and I got to know each other quite a bit. I had known her enough for years to tell her how I felt and just how much I enjoyed it. We had gone to college together and both of us were a bit shy at first, but it didn't take long for us to become great friends. I could only imagine how many girls knew my wife's sexual side. She had confessed to me once that she had heard that the more a girl came along, the more likely she was going to end up liking, liking. She would say that she wouldn't stop me from hooking a girl up. In my mind, we were both the same, so I was okay with it. But, I don't like a lot of things in our marriage to make it awkward. She didn't have a lot of experience, but that didn't mean she would be easy for me, either. So I was okay with her seeing Jason.</p> <p>As we kissed, I wrapped my arms around her and pulled her closer for a deeper, more passionate embrace. Our kissing intensified until all inhibitions were gone. The way she was holding me and kissing me were driving me wild as I held on for dear life.</p> <p>Suddenly, there was a rap on the door and my wife broke our embrace.</p> <p>"Come on! Let me at that guy for a minute!" she called back. I quickly grabbed my phone and headed to the door as Jason and her emerged from their room. Jason was the first and it felt like it took forever before we had made eye contact. We just stared at each other for a couple of seconds, as if we were still on one of our best days with the past years passing quickly by, before we broke and hugged. Jason and I smiled as we did. We had never done anything like this with a married man before, especially with our kids out of the house. He was as close to my wife as we'd ever been.</p> <p>"Wow! That was close!" I said to him as he put on his coat. I could see Jasonâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
