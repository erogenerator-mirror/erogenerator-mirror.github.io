We started getting into a rhythm, and then I turned over onto my back and he knelt between my open legs. “How did I even get your leg into them?” I murmured to him.</p> <p>“Oh I didn’t think that would do any real harm,” he replied. I moved and straddled his waist, his erection coming towards me as if it was a weapon aimed at me with a glint in its eye. I moved it closer to my slit and let him know that I wanted him to move down so that the tip of his penis could enter me.</p> <p>It did not take him long before he was in. I sighed as he sunk into me and he began to move. Our bodies were pressed up against each other as he pushed in and out, making noises and making his penis as hard as rock under my nakedness.</p> <p>I moved my hips so that my vagina squeezed his cock, trying to force that thing into my vagina. When I did this, we both groaned as we heard the sound of the front door and suddenly my first husband was entering the hotel reception. He smiled when saw me laying there naked as a babies. I saw a smile of happiness in his eyes and a look of pleasure on his face.</p> <p>“Oh that should save the neighbours in the car park for the best,” he managed to say. I noticed the look of lust in his eyes and noticed that he had his hands inside his pants.</p> <p>“Now let me take care of that,” said my love. With that, we turned over each other and sat back on the bed. I had him lay on his back and I raised my leg up to straddle him and slide into him. The sex was incredible! Both of us had the same technique of taking the other’s penis deep inside as it slowly moved in and out. We both moaned as we came together, his semen having been released inside me, the feeling of his semen as it spurted into my vagina caused a shiver of delight as I did so.</p> <p>We just lay quietly with our arms around each other, both breathing heavily and our legs still wrapped around each other, kissing as if we had never kissed before, the after effects of the passion making us both want to lie there for quite some time as we lay on each other’s naked bodies.</p> <p>We eventually got to our feet and went into the shower, the warm water making its way down my back as we held each other and kissed. The time was right! And when we were finished, we dressed and went into the reception hall in the main lounge.</p> <p>The people there were all very good looking, and when I mentioned that there were a few that I knew from the office that I could talk to, they all seemed like very nice people. They seemed to have a natural appreciation of us and our good looks and all the things we could do to each other.</p> <p>We then headed round to our separate rooms so that I could stay in the same room with my husband after our evening of lovemaking. After our initial conversation, I felt that the moment had passed and it was time to take things a step further.</p> <p>“Well I don’t know if he will want to screw with our relationship if I don’t keep him to myself,” I mused to myself as I lay naked on my bed, half sitting at my dressing table reading the menu.”</p> <p>I wondered where we had been when I felt a hand on my bum, or what I had been wondering about. It seemed as though it was my love, my husband that was rubbing gently and seductively up and down my bum. I turned round and saw his hand on my shoulder. “Don’t bother, we don’t really have a choice here and if he still wants to screw, he will have to agree right now!”</p> <p>I didn’t think my husband would agree. Perhaps that's what the couple that we were talking to at the reception were suggesting but I was not going to mention it just yet. I thought of his agreement which, if it would allow a certain amount of privacy, I could give them. It was a sort of a sexual agreement! He would agree, then I would—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
