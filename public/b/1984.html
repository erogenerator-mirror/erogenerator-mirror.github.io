I'll look like a pervert." She smiled.</p> <p>Later that night, she woke me up by caressing my dick. I thought it would be all right but she went and sat down next to me and said she was sorry.</p> <p>"Not my problem," I said, knowing full well that I was wrong.</p> <p>"No, you're wrong. No, I'm not. I'd like you to look like that for me, too, just to see if I can turn a woman on."</p> <p>"I thought that you wouldn't want me to have an exhibitionist streak like that?"</p> <p>"That is not the case! The woman I enjoy seeing can be so much more than I'm used to."</p> <p>"No, that isn't true. I am not like you. You haven't let me see the body I want to see. And not the body that you want me to take care of."</p> <p>"I think you are making my body hard with your words. Now if one of the guys from work looks our way, I'm sure he'll come over to your place."</p> <p>So, that was that. I was free to come over anytime I wanted but I had to figure out how she felt so I told her what her problem was. I knew she felt that I had broken that woman as a sexual friend but couldn't help feeling that she would do anything to keep me. If it means that I had to satisfy her but I couldn't, I didn't want to break her friendship with me.</p> <p>I had told her on several occasions that if I ever came over I would be too embarrassed to just go on a long, boring date. Well, I was not going to make that happen. If I did that, I wouldn't be that surprised. She probably could read my mind and knew what I was thinking about. But I was going to have to get that done.</p> <p>The week before I got to talk to her, I was already on the way to work when she came by.</p> <p>"Hi, Mark. How are you today?" She smiled and said hello.</p> <p>The work day went well so I had to come home after work. I was looking forward to seeing her so I didn't let her get dressed up as she usually did. As I walked by her she looked up to see me approaching her and she smiled and said "Hi."</p> <p>"Hello, hon. You look lovely this morning."</p> <p>"Thanks, honey. You're looking good that way."</p> <p>"Oh, really?" So far nothing has surprised me though. I was wearing a dress she like. "I don't wear the fancy business casual look with the formal ones. The one I like is too soft and a bit formal."</p> <p>"I wasn't planning on dressing up like that."</p> <p>"You could wear one but it looks like you're a little shy. You know, like a slut about to the office."</p> <p>"I had my heart set on doing business for a little while but I just can't do anything about it. Maybe I'll see you on the golf course. Or you know." If I did that, my luck would be good.</p> <p>She didn't say anything but she did seem a bit nervous.</p> <p>"Are you free this weekend? I have a feeling that you will be. That one is just a bonus, you know? You are the perfect wife that I've always loved. I think we could make a great couple."</p> <p>"I would like to meet you, hon. I'd like for us to do some things together, together only, when you want. I know that I'm not perfect but I can't think of any other person that I'd rather be with than you."</p> <p>"My heart wouldn't be as sure about that as yours. You're a different kind of woman than you think."</p> <p>"Hey, look what you have done!" She didn't get the joke before but I didn't have to take her seriously. I just told her how I felt about her being with me. She smiled at that.</p> <p>"I'm getting married on Sunday, honey. You will never find someone like me in the world with you."</p> <p>"There's always that chance that I won't get married at all, honey."</p> <p>"Not to me, I'll marry you after I think of you. I am your friend now and you've made a friend in my eyes so don't expect too many opportunities."</p> <p>"I've already got friends, Mark. I'm happy with that. You will never have a boyfriend with a girl like me on your arm or in your mouth. I would like for you to come by and have a good time."</p> <p>"What? Are you sure? It would do me some good to find someone like youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
