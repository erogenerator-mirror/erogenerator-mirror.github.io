"You'll get through everything."</p> <p>Once the movie was over the lights went back on and he stood up; his eyes flicked to the TV and he turned back to Kaylee. After a minute, their heads again came up together and they turned towards each other and kissed passionately.</p> <p>They fell to the floor and were still kissing when the room suddenly burst into silence while the door to the bathroom swung closed.</p> <p>Kaylee moved one leg between and wrapped it around Rob's so she could lock his arms around her slender waist.</p> <p>"I never would've thought we'd get into this," she said softly while they kissed again.</p> <p>"That's because we didn't."</p> <p>"So, did you like it?" she asked lightly.</p> <p>"Mmm...no. That was incredible. I like what you just did to me," he replied before kissing her again.</p> <p>"I like what I just did with you. We should do this again."</p> <p>"Maybe," he replied before kissing her on her beautiful nose, but she wouldn't turn on the light. Instead she ran her hands down his neck, across his chest and down his abs.</p> <p>"Where are we going now," she asked after she finished kissing him.</p> <p>"In the darkness of the night. Right here in front of us," he replied with a grin.</p> <p>"Yeah. It's going to be incredible," she teased him when he slid down the bed and moved over her.</p> <p>Kaylee felt the sheets as they rolled over and over her body, teasing her all the time she was on her hands and knees, with her back arched and her ass sticking up in the air. She never noticed that he moved up until she felt him lean forward until he was lying over her, his penis nestled in the crack of her ass. She reached down, reached back and put one hand against his chest as the other hand began to explore his body as she ran her hand along the shaft of his cock that was now hard and standing above her lower body. They stopped at his cock and he lifted himself slightly so she could pull back the foreskin so that her fingers could run through his shaft and feel the swollen ridge of skin. The feeling was just about too much, and she took hold of his cock and pressed the head against her opening.</p> <p>"Don't fuck yet!" she whispered as she pushed him up so she could lay down again.</p> <p>"But this is so much fun," she murmured. "I'm already so wet and slippery for you," she added, taking his cock in her hand and guiding it to her entrance.</p> <p>She was so wet and ready; she pushed herself down on his cock, savouring the feeling of being finally filled and wanting more. She felt so beautiful as her pussy slid down on to him. She lifted up and slid down again, but faster.</p> <p>"Oh god you feel so good," she moaned as she ground her wet pussy against his body. "I can't believe it's here, inside me!" she moaned repeatedly as she rode him, taking the shaft almost to her own body and holding it there, giving it little twists and turns with her pussy as they kissed again.</p> <p>They came together quickly and quietly on the bed. They lay there kissing on each other's naked bodies, feeling and touching the softness of their skin and hearing the wetness between their legs flowing from Kaylee's pussy.</p> <p>A soft knock at the door brought them around but they both knew it was the security guard from the restaurant.</p> <p>"Hi. There's someone at our door," he said to Kaylee before walking through the door.</p> <p>Kaylee rolled her eyes and looked at his silhouette in his hallway. He was all dressed up again except for a pair of black stilettos on the floor and on his feet were a black dress shirt and black, open fronted pants. She smiled wickedly at this.</p> <p>"You're late for work," he said, as he opened the door.</p> <p>"Oh, I haven't seen you in ages," she said, as the door clicked shut.</p> <p>"I told you. I got home late today and I got back some of my clothes when I was changing," he said.</p> <p>"Well, you just got home, don't worry," she told him. "We've got company to keep."</p> <p>"Okay, thanks," he said and then leaned back against the wall and looked at Kaylee. He stood at the door for a moment with his eyes closed before reaching into his inside pocket and removing a twenty-dollar bill, handing it to Kaylee.</p> <p>Tapping his finger on the outside of his indexâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
