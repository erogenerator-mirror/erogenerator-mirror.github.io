"That's not important," I said.</p> <p>"What was her name," she continued with the same question?</p> <p>"I don't know," I replied. "I'll probably keep that in the next few minutes."</p> <p>"I can be a little crude, but can you be a little less crude?" she inquired as she stood.</p> <p>"I don't think I am. Not really," I responded quickly.</p> <p>We walked out and I turned on my heel and followed her to her table. There were two other women in the restaurant, but she was talking and dancing with the woman on her left. I was seated between them. I watched her and the women exchange glances and smiles from time to time. But the more I stood in the window, the more interesting her looks became. When she came to a stop near me, her face had a bit of a flush to it and her lips were slightly parted to reveal a little moistness.</p> <p>"I told you," she began, "I told you she had a sexy body and a hot mouth."</p> <p>I couldn't tell about her mouth, but I already knew that she had a beautiful round face and full lips and a small nose. The woman at her table was a tall, attractive blond and the two of them were laughing and talking and I couldn't think of a word to describe this beautiful woman and then both her dates left leaving us alone.</p> <p>As we were leaving, the other woman came to stand beside me and our lips met again, but this time I could feel heat and light.</p> <p>"You said you were a 'blond' but I don't believe that," she whispered as she held me tighter. "Let me see," I pulled her to a stop in front of me and she leaned forward to look. I took my jacket off of a chair and removed it and her jacket as well. She held my hands in hers and pressed her breasts to me and I slid my hands between them and her sweater and pulled up over her breasts. As I pressed my lips to hers, she parted her lips and her tongue met mine. Her sweater slipped easily off to the floor and was only held in my mind so I slipped my hands to it and found bare skin and her bra as well. I slowly slid the straps off her shoulders and she lifted her arms to let me unfasten the bra.</p> <p>As I did, she pulled my jacket off of me and unbuttoned it quickly. I watched her bra as one strap slipped off and I removed it with both hands. I pulled her sweater over her head and laid her sweater on a chair.</p> <p>She slid her hands up my shirt and pulled my shirt off and we stood facing each other naked. She kissed the base of my neck again and my lips parted briefly to allow her full touch of my skin. I gently ran my fingers along the back of her hand as our lips broke. Hers kissed her way up my throat and her warm fingers felt soft and soft.</p> <p>"Let's get out of here," she said pulling me out of my seat and dragging me to the exit, dragging me along after her the entire way.</p> <p>At the exit, we made a stop in a restaurant and had a few more drinks. I looked out of curiosity at where we were heading, but it was too early to see. We pulled up to a stoplight and both of us looked at one other for a second, then we pulled into a parking place outside of town.</p> <p>I pulled my arm from around her waist and helped her with her jacket. As she stood, I held onto her tight to my body and felt her breasts pushing into my chest. I pulled my shirt tails up over my waist and dropped them on the seat. Then I kissed her lightly on the lips and pulled up on her top, making sure to be somewhat close to her.</p> <p>When she opened my shirt and took it off, she kissed my chest and nipples until they stood to attention, then she pulled my shirt off and took my nipples in her hands and began kissing and licking them. As she stroked, sucked and bit them, I kissed down her neck to her shoulders. As I unzipped her skirt, I slipped my zipper and it fell to the ground in a heap on the front seat. She lifted her ass from the seat and I moved her skirt down over her shoes and then her legs. She stood, pulling her panties off and kicked off her shoes, and stood naked in front of me. My hands moved to unhook her bra and I slid it off and set it beside the car as she helped me unhook it. She then slid her hands around my neck and pulled me to her. She kissed me with more passion than I thoughtâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
