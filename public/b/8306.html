I was getting wet again as I drove down the block and into a hotel room.</p> <p>As I walked up and knocked on the door I heard him say, "Come in. I'm glad you are awake; I thought you were sleeping."</p> <p>"I am and we are going to change."</p> <p>"Okay; but first make yourself comfortable."</p> <p>I laid down on the bed and his voice was as familiar as if we were in high school. "So here's yours." And he handed me the glass of champagne.</p> <p>"Oh wow, you are such a great host. Thank you."</p> <p>After a sip he said, "Well I could sure use a good night's sleep."</p> <p>"Well yes, I mean yes"</p> <p>"Well I am going to be out all night."</p> <p>"Well I got to hit the shower."</p> <p>"Come on, you will be ready for me when I get done with you. And I don't mean there will be a bed here. So let's go get something to eat."</p> <p>"Okay but just to let you know I'm getting a nap, ok?"</p> <p>"Sounds good to me," and as we turned off the lights of the rooms our eyes were locked on the other as we passed the main floor.</p> <p>He knocked on the door and I opened it then looked down his body. His cock was hard as a rock, almost pushing out the front of his boxers. He was sitting in a chair looking around the room but it looked like we had another night together.</p> <p>"I hope you don't mind me getting up?"</p> <p>I couldn't take my eyes off him; he had such a nice tan all over, and those golden curls down around his legs; I couldn't hold this in anymore.</p> <p>"No, you can get up. I don't mind at all."</p> <p>"Good, now hurry up so I can help you shower."</p> <p>As he left the room I closed the door and stood there looking at his back, the only other indication I was seeing that his body was different. He had to have worked out, or at least I thought I had on, but I could not figure out his body.</p> <p>"You must be a very fit man."</p> <p>"As I've told you before, exercise is not good for me. I do not think weight room is your job."</p> <p>That really didn't even bother me; it didn't matter that I was there in the middle of the night watching a complete stranger get up while I was getting my own. I could almost hear the sweat pouring off his face as he stood there looking at me.</p> <p>I went to him quickly, putting my arms around his waist and kissed him. I kissed him softly on his lips then his chin until I was kissing him all over before sliding my tongue into his mouth to let him know it was okay to talk. "God you are so beautiful" I said to him before sliding down his body.</p> <p>I kissed my way down his chest before kissing his stomach and kissing up to his belly button. His cock jumped and when I looked up into his face he had a smirk on his face as if everything was okay.</p> <p>"What, what are you doing," he said trying to sit up as I leaned down and kissed down his stomach until I reached his cock. I licked on it from the base of his sack up to the head before putting my mouth around the tip of his cock sucking on it as if I had never sucked it before.</p> <p>"Oh my God," he couldn't believe it as his cock stood up straight with blood pulsed up and down.</p> <p>His cock never went down in his life and I never could take him all the way into my mouth. I sucked his little head in and out of my mouth trying to imagine how hard my little pussy would be if she was sucking on him, hoping he would take me to a place where she could get up and get a few things for breakfast.</p> <p>"Oh god, this is awesome, I never thought this is possible."</p> <p>"Just be glad you're safe and this is not your first time sucking a man's cock."</p> <p>"It's not your first, it is. He must have gone to the bathroom because there is no more room in here."</p> <p>"Yeah, probably because your mouth is empty and there's nowhere to go anyway."</p> <p>I could feel his cock getting bigger, and it must have been getting really hard as well, I could only imagine how big it would get if I had my pussy filled with a cock.</p> <p>"Oh god, I'm going to cum."</p> <p>And I didâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
