When I wake, he's still asleep with his hands clasped behind his head. I look back to him and smile. His smile is soft.</p> <p>When I get back to my room, he is just waking up, his hand still in his shorts, and I notice his shorts are still on. He's still out. I walk in to the bathroom to start the shower. I turn on the tap, then step up, and put the water on full. I turn around, and he is in front. He looks at me, and says, “Good morning,”. I smile and he smiles back.</p> <p>We dry off, and come out to kiss and feel good again. I run my hands down his chest and belly.</p> <p>“Mmmm that was nice. You can make breakfast if you want that much.” He says, and I get a plate out of the kitchen. I put my dishes away and turn around. I kiss him again, this time on the lips, then grab his ass and pull him closer. He feels different, I guess, and he looks at me, then me, and reaches down and strokes my cock. The feel of his hand is different. He moves his hand down further, and his fingers reach my scrotum. He plays and strokes, and I reach up and run my fingers through his hair.</p> <p>I lead him to the bedroom. I pull his shirt up, and he stands to help me, then turns around. I push away his shirt, and kiss his chest, and run my fingers through the silky hair. He unbuttons my shorts, and I push them down. He pushes my shorts down over my hips, and they tangle on the carpet. I step out of them and he starts taking them off. He gets a shirt off and lays it on the floor, then puts his shirt back on. We're in front of each other, and I'm trying to remove his shorts. He pushes them away, and pulls his dick out, and I reach down to take it. It's already pretty hard, so I put both hands around it and start stroking.</p> <p>I keep stroking it, as the water continues to run down his chest. When I come to rest, I kiss it, and let him go.</p> <p>“Good morning,” he says.</p> <p>“Good morning,” I say, and I kiss his dick again. When he's ready, I stand up, and he goes to stand after me. I lead him over to the bed.</p> <p>“I've been dreaming of this for so long,” he says, and kisses me.</p> <p>“I've dreamed of doing for you the same things I told you to do.” I say, then lay down. He slides his cock in to me with one easy stroke. We're so wet, he slides back and forth a little. I feel him slide down to my balls, and he kisses my balls.</p> <p>He takes first one, then the other, between his lips, then sucks them and takes turns licking it. I grab the back of his head, which he loves. I can feel him suck. I feel the lips of his tongue slide up and down. I can feel it slide in and out. I can feel it going in.</p> <p>I feel the tip of his dick slip, and the head pushes inside to the back. And slowly but steadily, slowly gets fully into me. It's like there's a force between us, between us, and he moves a little in, just a little more each push. I'm not sure if we're in love or just in one. I don't know for sure.</p> <p>I can feel him starting to go in and out, and I start to get more excited. I push up and lean back on my elbows. He puts a hand up to play with my nipples, and his other hand goes down to start to play with my balls. I feel it rub against my stomach. My balls are really sensitive. I'm breathing faster and harder.</p> <p>The hand around my balls moves faster. My nipples are pinching against his finger tips, and I'm moving my hips in a circle. I'm going to come any second.</p> <p>“Oh, oh, OH, OH, OOOOHGHHH!!!” I shout. I hold onto his hand, and I try to move his hand up, and down, and in. He doesn't let it go, just holds it steady while I cum.</p> <p>He slides out until just the head is inside me, then shoves it back in. He's still standing, so I turn around. He leans into me—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
