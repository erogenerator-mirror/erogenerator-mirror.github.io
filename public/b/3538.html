However, I couldn't go too fast and I figured there was no harm in taking a little bit of time, so I set up a slow, teasingly paced pace.</p> <p>As I felt the beginnings of my climax building in the pit of my stomach, I could feel the muscles fluttering and tightening in her grip of my hip with her mouth, pulling me into her with her hands and tongue while she moved herself in perfect synchronization with me. The sound of her voice filling the whole of my head set me off and my hips jerked and jerked and jerked.</p> <p>I'm not one to exaggerate when it comes to being in love, but I did not have a particularly talented lover, as I expected her to always be a bit on the short side. Even as I experienced my orgasm, I could tell that she was having the same sort of effect on me. She worked her mouth just right and her tongue seemed to slide back and forth on my cock, all the time trying to coax me to cum.</p> <p>As the orgasm seemed to intensify, I could hear the soft, wet sucking of her lips as they slid back down the length of my shaft until their tips were teasing the tip, just as my load was about to burst from the tip. At this point, I was so lost in myself that I didn't even notice Monica until I opened my eyes. She was just staring at me, a huge smile on her face, so I turned to get a hold of myself, but as soon as I did, my hands went to my head and I felt a huge, powerful blast of cum just hit the back of my throat.</p> <p>I couldn't swallow it fast enough and I actually choked a little and then just kind of fell backward onto the floor. Monica rolled over and looked at me, still grinning, and I could see a trail of hot drool running down her chin.</p> <p>"That was awesome!" I whispered. "How did I know you were something special?"</p> <p>"Well, like you said," she said with a laugh, "I haven't done that in a long time."</p> <p>"Neither have I," I answered. "I can probably get my hands on another woman by the time I get done with you."</p> <p>"You are pretty good at that, aren't you?" She said with a smirk. "Did I get a taste of that?"</p> <p>"God, you're dirty. Don't let that stop you from enjoying yourself," I retorted with a smile.</p> <p>"I'm sure I'll enjoy it if you do," she laughed, "unless you'd rather be on your knees," with a wink.</p> <p>I laughed back, not knowing how I felt about that, but I didn't push it either. "Oh, don't worry. I'll always be available," I assured her, "and I'll always be there if you need a hand."</p> <p>I thought that she'd said that she'd never let me do that, but she just looked at me with a serious expression on her face, as if she was trying to determine if she was serious or notâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
