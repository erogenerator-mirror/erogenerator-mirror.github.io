She thought perhaps she could take him upstairs and have wild sex. She had tried the dildos in the bathroom, but had not got anywhere near to what she needed. She didn't think even having one in her pussy would feel like that and that she would like better with a bigger one. Maybe she would take him upstairs again in two days time and have more fun. As she thought these thoughts, she started to feel slightly nauseated. She didn't know why that would hurt the mood any more but she knew for sure it was affecting her overall state of arousal, especially with a thick one in her pussy.</p> <p>She decided if she were going to take the dildo on this trip it would have to be a long one and to be sure, she would take care of how long the dildo was in her pussy. She knew she'd have to put two and two together anyway. She figured the next thing she knew she headed back to her hotel room. He would be gone and at least she hoped she would be able to talk to him first. She was getting wet and the thoughts that ran through her mind as she got to her room changed from making love to a stranger at the mall to having sex with him in her bed...</p> <p>She knew that the next day would be a new day and she wasn't counting the chances of that happening. She was now almost two weeks until she would see him again, just the day of his return. It really only made it a day before her and the idea of being unfaithful to her boyfriend with that same cock in her pussy was turning her on again with each step. She wasn't sure if it was the idea of what might happen or whether it had been a dream come to life once she was back and was doing something she didn't like.</p> <p>She had only the one change to make the next day or so before the second week had come around and she was finally sure she was on her own. She didn't know how she had planned on him in her room again, as she had not been the best lover of the afternoon and although she did enjoy what he did to her, something else she hadn't done yet.</p> <p>A couple weeks passed and she wasn't even thinking about it. She didn't know how he would be doing it or whether he would be that way or not but she decided to go along. He seemed like a nice guy and she would try to take it slow this time. When she got him to let her use the bathroom she got herself off in his room with her boyfriend's cock up her pussy and her boyfriend's face buried between her legs, kissing and licking her. She was thinking again about the idea of him having two cocks in her pussy and his tongue in her mouth. She wasn't going to say she didn't like it either, which she did.</p> <p>It worked, she managed to get a few more orgasms from his cock in her pussy and when she took the big end of it into her mouth he didn't even hesitate. This was really getting to her though. It was nice to feel his balls in her hand, even feel him sliding into her mouth. He was so very hot and she could feel his heart beating in her pussy... She didn't think the size of his cock might be a problem, but he was definitely in there she thought. Her thinking was getting more and more erotic as she was thinking the same thing but not doing anything for more than a couple minutes. Even that was not enough to push her higher into the clouds. She finally decided she was going to enjoy herself. She finally decided to let her own feelings about her sex drive overcome her and she couldn't think of another thing she desired from her boyfriend. She hoped maybe she would soon stop using it and just enjoy things this way. As she was thinking these thoughts and thinking what might or might not happen once she suddenly felt his hand on the back of her shoulders.</p> <p>'You don't make me do this all the time do you?'</p> <p>She almost yelled at the look on his face. Even though she tried not to, she tried not to, but she was always worried they might not get it this time. She remembered his reaction, he wasn't making up his mind, he wanted her and she wasn't doing anything to stop him from wanting her.</p> <p>'No, I never make myself do this. I would never cheat on you, I wouldn't do this on a first date'</p> <p>Just her second orgy she thought and she smiled to herself for being positive about being on a first date. She loved what they were doing with each other. It was nice and she could feel her pussy getting wet just thinking about it but she had to stop.</p> <p>His hand reached around to the front of her shoulders, taking the weight off her shoulders as it went lower.
