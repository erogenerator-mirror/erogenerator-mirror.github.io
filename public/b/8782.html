She reached down and grasped my cock in her hand, and I didn't stop her.</p> <p>She stroked me with slow, deliberate slowness, stroking my shaft, making it look more and more the perfect little cock.</p> <p>"Mmmmm, that feels so good, baby." I said, and I kissed her again, and stroked her hair back and kissed hers again.</p> <p>Her hand reached for my balls and cupped them, squeezing me, and I knew that was going to get me there. I stroked her hair and back, feeling her tremble.</p> <p>"I want you to do this, baby." I said, and she nodded, her eyes locking onto mine.</p> <p>She began stroking me with her hands. Slow. Soft. Up and down. Up and down, she stroked me... I was about to cum. God, I was so close.</p> <p>She watched me, and stroked me faster. I couldn't hold it back any more.</p> <p>"Oh, God, baby!" I moaned as the first squirt of cum came out of my cock.</p> <p>She watched me as the first wad shot out and onto her fingers, which continued to stroke me.</p> <p>Oh, God! I thought to myself, that's... incredible!</p> <p>"That was great." I said suddenly, and she looked up at me with my cum dripping down her chin and onto her tits.</p> <p>"I thought you were going to die from embarrassment, honey." Her voice was a little tremulous, and she looked over at me with those dark green eyes, and I knew I was smiling. "It was great."</p> <p>She leaned down and kissed the last drops of cum off my cock, then licked her fingers clean, then kissed me again, and she licked the rest of the cum off her fingers and looked into my eyes and I couldn't help a grin.</p> <p>My hand was all over her body as she leaned up and kissed me again, our tongues fighting inside each other's mouth.</p> <p>I reached my other hand up and pinched her nipple between my finger and thumb. She giggled and I laughed, then ran my finger into her mouth, and she sucked on it as I moved off the bed and stood around it to let us kiss again.</p> <p>We kissed for several moments, then she pulled her face away from mine and I stood up, and she pulled me back down onto her bed.</p> <p>"We... we can't" I said. "I'm tired..." I stammered, then kissed her. "But I want to." I said softly, reaching down and pulling her up on top of me, our legs overlapping and we were pressed together.</p> <p>We kissed again, a long, wet, passionate, hot, tongue swirling kiss. There wasn't any hurry now, just long, loving kisses, and I felt the first drops of my own cum on her breasts. She kissed me back as her hands ran up and down my back and her hips rubbed against mine, our bodies moving together as we kissed.</p> <p>Finally, she broke the wet liplock as our tongues licked her lower lips, my cock nestled between her thighs and she ran her fingers through my hair as I reached for her.</p> <p>She reached down to my cock, stroking it, and I reached up to grab her breasts, rolling her hard nipples between my fingers. "Oh, that feels good, baby." she said, and I started to kiss my way down her neck, across her collarbone, and down to her tits again.</p> <p>I slid off the bed and pulled her panties down, then tossed them onto the floor, following with my boxer shorts. As I sat up, she leaned back and spread her legs, showing her pussy up to me.</p> <p>I leaned down and kissed her, then slid my tongue into her hot, wet pussy, moaning into my girlfriend's pussy as I tongue fucked her. She slid a hand down to my cock, and rubbed her fingers together to coat them, moaning again as I tasted her on my tongue.</p> <p>She sat up, and I could feel her hands on my cock, sliding it back and forth as she pumped me. I was on fire, and I wanted her right then.</p> <p>She climbed off me and knelt right in front of me, her pussy inches from my face, one hand stroking my cock, the other teasing her pussy lips.</p> <p>I couldn't speak. This was hot, and I wanted this badly.</p> <p>"Lay down." she said, and I didâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
