He was a man who needed to be in control of his body for a moment, but also a man who had the potential to lose himself in ecstasy. His wife had told him it was best to be more assertive and not to just play with himself when he came. He thought he would be in charge of himself too. What was it going to be like?</p> <p>After a long moment, he pulled his hand back and looked at it. Yes, his cock had hardened and was jutting from his body. It made him feel very self-conscious. He reached down to his scrotum and began to lift back the hair and felt that his fingers had gone red from handling himself without permission. He sat on his heels, and began to shake his head to clear the confusion and make his mind move over what he should do about the situation.</p> <p>The next thing he felt was pressure on his shoulder and he glanced up at the man. He was a good man now. He stood and began to gather his robes. He picked them up and walked back to the door. "Thank you, sir. It'll be okay. It's always good to see new members whenever I come here. It has been really nice being a man, sir. I feel like there's a bit of a contradiction."</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess there is. I've had a long day. I have a couple people coming in the evening to work on getting the pool set up, but they won't be too late. They'll finish up after I've finished dinner and I'll be ready for them."</p> <p>"Is there anything else, sir?"</p> <p>"That is a good question. I'll have to let you know the answer in the morning."</p> <p>He had not even realized he needed the bathroom until he started to clean out his hair. He went inside the bathroom, and was surprised to find the door was fully open. He walked in and closed the door. There was only one other person in the bathroom when he closed it, so he assumed the man wanted to take a shower. His head was starting to hurt. He wanted to turn around, but decided he would just go with the flow. He took a moment to take care of her hair and to collect his thoughts. He figured why bother so quickly. He didn't mind that she was waiting at the end of the bench, so he turned her head to him again and kissed her. His tongue slipped into her mouth and she returned the kiss as deep as it would go. He could smell the soap as it slid over her body. He took his hand and began to rub her stomach and slowly inched it down her body. He could feel himself becoming harder. He pushed away from her.</p> <p>"Oh. Oh. I... I... I thought I would... uh...." He felt as if he had been doing this all his life. That was probably his way.</p> <p>But here was a man that didn't seem to worry about his own body hair at all. He pulled his own shirt off and dropped it to the ground. Her legs came to rest at his knees and he saw in the mirror that they were both wearing slacks. She was sitting on the toilet and his body shook as he stood in front of her. He looked down and saw a look of desire in her eyes. He smiled at his self and felt the first surge. He had made his decision. He had been a man and now it would be him that was in charge. That thought excited him at different levels. He wasn't sure he could do it in the shower with other women. No man, male, male, was going to try. He wanted her to give herself to him as well as to do what he wanted her to do to him. Right now, however, she could probably do all of that. He had to know what was going on inside her head.</p> <p>He ran his hands up her stomach. He looked at her hands as they slowly made their way down her body. He got behind her and began to rub the area where she had touched him. Her body seemed to react to something he was doing. He could feel her body tense under him. He felt her legs spread and move against his hips. One of her hands moved to her clit and began to rub lightly. He could feel himself throbbing, and hoped he wasn't going to blow his load just yet. He ran his finger down over the lips of her pussy and felt the warmth and the wetness. It was very wet. Her body twitched slightly, and she gasped. He pressed a finger into her and felt the muscles around it. Her body trembled and her head slowly shot up to see what he was doing. He looked at her face and saw that her eyes were closed.
