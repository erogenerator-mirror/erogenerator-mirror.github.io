The work she had put in to prepare for such a massive shift on its last day had been wasted and the best was probably not long.</p> <p>It was as if the old man had given her the last word. It looked like it was the right thing to do and it was her duty to do it. To keep that task under her control and make sure it had made the best of what may happen. Maybe not to keep it, but to keep her job. She was going with him.</p> <p>Her smile was gone. She knew it. She needed to put herself out there and be as kind of a lady as she could. A very good lady.</p> <p>"My man here is not one of those two in love birds, and he really doesn't want to seem like a fool." She turned back around and moved to the front of the desk. "What do you think of the work done?"</p> <p>She turned back around and leaned against the wall.</p> <p>"What exactly do you think of the work I've done?" She kept her head up and looked up at him.</p> <p>"Well, it's not much. But you got yourself a man."</p> <p>"I don't think I'm the type to be a man." She laughed.</p> <p>"Don't. What's your type?"</p> <p>"Exc... no, I'm not."</p> <p>"But you are. You are what? Beautiful. So young. Sexy? Sexy, hot. Do you want it. Don't you think you want some of that?"</p> <p>"Yes, you are wonderful. I need you."</p> <p>"I'm not a man, and I really don't like young men."</p> <p>"Don't lie to me you dumb shit. Don't you want to be a woman. To be a woman? You got a man that want me."</p> <p>"I have someone."</p> <p>"No, not a man. I'm not. You know what it is that's wrong with you? You want to be with a man that's not a man? Is that it? You don't think if you are a woman it's only a man that'll want you? You might find him handsome, or maybe even sexy, and you want him to want you. And just what do you want?" She was almost mocking him, but not quite, as she knew it.</p> <p>"It's not what you said."</p> <p>"Bullshit, I've been here five days. Why wouldn't you take me? Don't you think I'm attractive?" Her voice had this little smile that could melt a wall. "Just tell me the truth, and all of the other things the old man had told you, and everything you've been told."</p> <p>"No, I don't think so. I'm good at what I do. I don't want to take advantage of a young woman like you."</p> <p>"You're not, and I can tell. Just say it and you can move on. I don't think I'm that old."</p> <p>"I'm not that old." Was she still smiling at him? "I'm not sure."</p> <p>She moved around him and moved towards him. "You don't like me. Don't you?"</p> <p>"What are you talking about?" He turned towards her.</p> <p>"I'm not that old." He reached up and ran his hands over her face.</p> <p>"Then why is that?" She was grinning at him as his hands moved to her body and held her against him. He had one arm around and his hand covering her breast. She was still smiling. She was still holding his hand across her body.</p> <p>"I mean, you're not so old." She moved his hand back to her face. "Don't be a wuss, you think I'm sexy? Can you? Are you?"</p> <p>She turned away, grabbed his arm and pulled him closer. When he backed away her eyes were looking back over her shoulder and he held her. It was like she knew what she was feeling. When he pulled her back she looked at him, and he looked at her. Her eyes were telling him something. A big, big, big, big, big truth.</p> <p>"I don't know but I'm not so old."</p> <p>"Well, not quite." His voice sounded low, but so sincere. "You're too beautiful. You're just so beautiful that I think you could keep yourself from being that old. Besides, look at me. You look absolutely gorgeous."</p> <p>He had said it quietly. But it was hard to be like this. Not because of the age barrier, but because he was so sincere. Just being around her made his heart beat and his cock start to harden. He was scared.
