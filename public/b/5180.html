"That's right, there, there, that's right, ohh, it's coming, I can feel it coming, go, go, go, go, oh, right there, oh, right there, oh gee-d, just, like, right there, right there, oh, right there, oh, just, I, I think, I think I, I, just, right there, oh, right there, I'm having, ah, an orgasm."</p> <p>"Oh, yes," she answered.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," he told her.</p> <p>"Oh, yes, baby, you're so hot, so beautiful, so sexy!...</p> <p>"Now, now," he said as she rubbed even faster.</p> <p>"Oh, yes, right on," she told him.</p> <p>"Oh, do you... do you like this?" he asked, as she pressed her fingers hard up and down with her mouth.
