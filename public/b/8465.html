Lina surfaced suddenly and began splashing. She reached out and grabbed the pool's edge, not caring that his eyes were watching her. She tried to get into the water as she was, but the slippery surface kept her from diving past him. Lina was drowning, and she had no way to help it. In her mind she could see the blue veins in the back of his neck. He felt her hands on it and she pulled it to her.</p> <p>A loud shriek, that was not coming out of her mouth, was all it took. He grabbed her behind the knees and lifted her into the water, her head and body pressing against the shallow end of the pool. She felt his hardness against her legs as he lifted her up high enough for him to support her. Lina tried to swim, to get away, but he was already under the water, holding her under a shoulder. His hands were strong, and he used them to lift Lina higher. His hands held her legs as he moved them around him. They looked in each other's eyes as the water rolled past them. He moved one of his hands downward to her inner thigh. He began to slide his hand up her sex.</p> <p>"I can't..."</p> <p>"I don't care," his voice said, "If you want me. I'll be right back."</p> <p>Lina began to feel his hand on her stomach. It was all she could do to keep from screaming aloud as he slid his hand under the water to her breasts. It was all she could do to keep from throwing up. He lifted one leg, then the other, and lowered her to the pool surface. Her legs were held over his shoulder as he spread her legs apart and lowered him between her thighs.</p> <p>Lina saw the huge bulge tenting his swimsuit, as his bulge rested on her tummy. He began to kiss her thighs, and then began to lower it over the swell of her hips. He was so big that the material was beginning to push it through his erection, and even that meant it was completely covered by his erection. His whole face was pressing against her as he began to lower himself to lie on her. Lina could feel the weight of him pressing his body against hers, the weight of his erection crushing hers, and she could barely breathe as the full weight of him sunk itself into her. Lina felt a tiny pang of fear as her thighs began to stretch out to take him completely into her body.</p> <p>She felt his hardness spreading her, and she knew what would happen next. He began to move in small, jerky motions. Lina felt another wave of fear as he lifted her higher. In the darkness, she could see her face as it became closer and closer to his, the pressure increasing by the second. He began to raise her more, and suddenly her body went limp. She heard him whisper "Are you alright? Are you alright?" against her lips, as he continued to gently move himself in and out of her.</p> <p>Lina didn't even know what to say. She could feel her body responding to his touch, and then to his, at the most intimate of sexual acts. He held her in his arms at first, and then began to lower himself with more ease because he had no intention of going soft. Lina could feel that her sex was on fire, and that heat was growing between her lips. She could hear him whispering to her, and knew it was over the roar of the power of sound.</p> <p>Suddenly her head was lifted in he air. Lina screamed, and she could hear the echo of it in the dark. His hard cock came out of her and she felt nothing, except that it was a small part of him inside her. Then her mind filled with a vague and intense realization. She thought to herself, "If only I had a penis!"</p> <p>She heard him speak again "Are you alright?"</p> <p>She could only shake her head. After several seconds she realized he was still there. She felt nothing, only warmth and the smell of him. She began to breath in his smell, as it filled the air. It was the smell of sex. He lowered himself back onto the grass next to her. He began to kiss her neck again. Lina lay there, just like she had done this last week when their bodies were in the pool. His cock was between her thighs, and only a half inch or so of him could enter her.</p> <p>"Please...please..." the thought started to creep in her mind.</p> <p>She tried to think, but every second, it seemed, it seemed like it wouldn't go. The strength in him was growing, and it only caused her to become weak at her waist. "God. I can't wait..." his voiceâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
