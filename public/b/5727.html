She reached out and wrapped her hand around my cock which was now at a very close proximity to her mouth.</p> <p>"Do...do you like it?"</p> <p>"I love it," she replied. "Come here."</p> <p>I moved in close to her and as our mouths met I felt her tongue move against mine. Her hand began to slowly move up and down my shaft. Her mouth moved further down the shaft and her hand stopped a moment and then began to gently caress my balls. Her lips left mine and I moved forward to allow my penis to escape her mouth. This new contact elicited a moan of appreciation from her which prompted me to move my hand to her throat. She smiled at me as though to encourage me to take control.</p> <p>Once there she moved her mouth away from mine and, grasping my penis in both hands, guided me into her. I watched her as she moved her lips to the tip of my rigid shaft and then slipped me back into her mouth. She took me in until my balls hit against her chin and then slowly removed me.</p> <p>"Don't move, I want to feel your cock in my pussy," she whispered. "You can come all you want."</p> <p>"Yes, ma'am." I responded to her request. With that I lifted the bottom of her dress again and slid her panties down her legs and dropped them on the floor. She stepped out of them, now naked except for her panties, and then turned toward me and stood facing me. I approached her and, placing one hand on each of her firm round breasts, cupped them, taking them in my hands and rolling her nipples between my thumbs and forefingers. She moaned softly as I tweaked and caressed her. I gently rolled her nipples between my fingers until they stood up like large pink erasers and then began moving my fingers up and down her firm flat stomach. She leaned back against my hips and then lifted her feet up onto the couch cushions.</p> <p>My hands continued their slow trek around her body, from her belly button to the top of her mound, and eventually finally came to rest on her bare ass. I slid my fingers down her ass and felt their warm dampness through the thin material of her panties. I slipped my finger back between her cheeks and ran it up and down the crack. She moaned again as my finger began pushing aside the front edge of her panties and sliding over the hardening clitoris peeking in through the thin material. I smiled at her and she smiled back at me as my finger began pressing against her and her clit started to rise against the cloth which was now pressing against her.</p> <p>I felt her hands against my shoulders as she pulled my hands away and guided them back toward her ass, as though trying to steer my lips and tongue against her. Her breathing was beginning to come in short rapid breaths as my finger slid deeper into the cleft between her cheeks and I lightly tapped her lightly.</p> <p>"No, no, my sweet," she whispered as she moved my hands off her buttocks and guided me to stand up.</p> <p>She took my hands as though we were lovers, placed them near her mouth, pushed them forward and took my hands away.</p> <p>"No, my sweet, not like this."</p> <p>"Oh, my sweet, your lips are so soft. I want you." My hands were now on her hips again, as though I had lost control of my own actions and was unable to control anything I wanted to do. She leaned over and kissed me once, long, deep, passionately and passionately followed by another long, slow, sensual second in our mouths. Her lips moved in a circular motion around mine and then closed around my lips again. I leaned forward and kissed her deeply as we moved out into the living room together.</p> <p>"My sweet, my sweet..." she whispered in a hushed, slightly hoarse tone.</p> <p>Our feet continued up the stairs and as we rose to our respective landing she opened her arms and we hugged again, both holding a hand between us to ward off the cold. There was a fire raging inside us but that was not what she needed at that moment. Her arms pulled me to her and we kissed deeply again this time more passionately than the first. Her fingers reached and began rolling my nipples as we stood there hugging in the warmth of the firelight still illuminated by the fire outside. Her hips humped against me as my penis thrust against her pelvis.</p> <p>Our kissing stopped as though we were frozen, and we turned our heads so that once again, only our eyes remained closed, as we continued staring at the flames. We continued staring at each other for what seemed like an eternity as I slowly broke our embrace and pulled away from her, but also so that neither of us could move away.
