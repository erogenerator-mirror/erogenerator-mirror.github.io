"Ooohhh, you're a bastard... " and she brought herself over and sat in the middle of the small kitchen bench, her legs on each side, her knees bent, the soft white silk of her nightie hiding her pubic strip...</p> <p>- - - - - - - -</p> <p>I went to get into the bedroom and had a few drinks then found a small mirror on to get a good look. My panties fell down with my husband's head and, when he realized I had no panties on, he raised his head and smiled. I felt quite embarrassed as his eyes studied my crotch. When I'd finished my whiskey, I saw that my husband, who was sitting at the end of the bed, had opened the robe and I felt his breath on my exposed thigh. "I'd love to feel that inside," he said softly. I felt his hands begin to explore my thighs and as he began to caress me with his hand, the tip of his finger touched my pussy lips and made soft circles around the lips. I closed my eyes and leaned against him, enjoying his touch. He was so soft and masculine, and my breath smelled of perfume and cologne.</p> <p>"You must be so wet." He slipped two fingers into me and began to finger fuck my pussy. "I bet you're glad to see me, isn't there?"</p> <p>I opened my eyes and looked away. "No, I'm not..."</p> <p>As a final tease, he reached for the lube, turned slightly onto his back and positioned himself for me. "I'll be right back."</p> <p>As he went to fill the tube, I reached for the lube. He had a big dick, I could feel every vein as it pulsed and I found I was getting wet. I squeezed my fingers together and lubed my fingers. As I squeezed my fingers together, I felt my pubic hair getting caught in its pubes hair. I rubbed the head of his dick up and down the length of my slit, up and down, coating him in my juices and then I eased him inside my wet pussy.</p> <p>"Honey, this thing is so big..." I held his face in my hands, pressing the head of his dick into my moist center. "I don't remember it being that big."</p> <p>He ran his dick up and down my slit while I held on to his face like an infant. He pressed his thumb at the opening of my dripping pussy and pushed.</p> <p>"Ooooohhh, yeah." My legs went up over his waist and my body was pushed up off the bed, he was the whole world to me. I closed my eyes and felt his dick slide deep inside me. His body was on mine and he was fucking me! I grabbed his hand and squeezed it, then put his palm to his mouth and sucked my finger clean.</p> <p>He smiled again and began to press deeper inside me again and my body began to respond. We were completely engrossed in our mutual pleasure, yet we knew we were only moments away from orgasm, so we began to fuck in time to our coupling. I felt the head of his dick, just the head, as he pushed against me. He kept going and my body began to tremble. I held onto his hand, I felt his dick slide in and out of me and for an instant, it just seemed like love at first sight.</p> <p>He pushed me back and reached for the tube of lube. He put an ample amount on his thumb and slid it into my ass. He held it there for a moment and I just stared in wonder. I began to fuck him with my body and we both knew we were at that point. "Honey, I..."</p> <p>"You want it in your ass? You want ass in your ass? Are you sure?" I looked deep into his eyes and I nodded, which he gave as he continued to slide his thumb in and out of my anus. His thumb was in my ass as far as it would go and it was all I could do not to cry out in ecstasy as my body trembled with the intense pleasure that had been building up from his touching.</p> <p>"You can take it in any hole you want," he said between gasps.</p> <p>I reached into my back pocket, found the lube and brought it to my husband's hand, which I kept out of sight as I stood there. I squirted a dollop of lube in my palm and ran it over his wrist, then down his hand. My fingers reached down to his hand, which I put to my pussy and began to masturbateâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
