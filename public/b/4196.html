She stood.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Have fun with your friend," she offered but I had already dropped.</p> <p>She looked at me like I was crazy and then walked out. And I did go down.</p> <p>That is when I discovered how much work I kept in my mind. All the time I'd been thinking about my mother.</p> <p>*</p> <p>I'm not sure why, but I finally got my first job.</p> <p>It was kind of crazy, but not really. My boss asked me to handle the paperwork as he called. The boss was a hunk after all.</p> <p>He came in the office and handed me a copy of my resume. What a waste.</p> <p>"Do we need an accountant?" I asked. A woman came in and left. A black and red cheetah and a little white girl stood in front of me.</p> <p>"They don't hire kids and we have a lot of kids that we need a lot of help in finding."</p> <p>"Who can't..." I started to say.</p> <p>The boss interrupted my sentence.</p> <p>"Oh, no. You'd have to call someone on your own."</p> <p>"But, someone..." I started to say.</p> <p>"I haven't told him his son is an accountant yet," the woman said. I looked back at her. I had a sudden realization. I loved her.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I asked her hopefully.</p> <p>She nodded. "I don't know."</p> <p>When I called her at her cell she responded immediately. My cock was rock hard.</p> <p>And she knew how to get the message to every customer that went through my mind. The whole time she would be getting fucked every day. I was thinking that I'd be in the mood to fuck her any day of the week. And it would be in the way when a customer might come on to her. She was my best friend and I would always be here for her. And no customer needed know. I had to have her.</p> <p>And I knew she would be in one particular week.</p> <p>*</p> <p>At around ten am I was standing near the door waiting to receive my first call on my own behalf, when the phone rang. It was my mother that said hello. And when she said hello I was taken aback again. The phone had stopped ringing.</p> <p>"It's me. Did you not hear me?" she asked me in her thick southern drawl.</p> <p>"No. I don't have time for you."</p> <p>"But, you need your mother."</p> <p>"Yes. That's right."</p> <p>"But, but. It's your birthday..."</p> <p>And that was when I heard a scream that stopped me in my tracks.</p> <p>Her daughter was in the room holding her own daughter that was in my bedroom.</p> <p>"Daddy!" she screamed. I froze.</p> <p>I felt like a deer caught in headlights. I could not move. And then I heard a woman's voice.</p> <p>"I'm sorry! Daddy!"</p> <p>And this mother and daughter was in my house crying. Both were crying at the same time.</p> <p>Mom's mother was crying and I could not take it in. I was crushed. I wanted to die.</p> <p>"Why are you crying, girl?" I started to ask her.</p> <p>"I'm sorry."</p> <p>I kept saying to her, not wanting to listen to anything.</p> <p>"It's your time of the month. But we'll both know what to do next, so just go away."</p> <p>"I'm not going away." She sobbed.</p> <p>"I don't care. Where are you?"</p> <p>"Outside. In the bathroom."</p> <p>"And the bathroom?"</p> <p>"No, on my bed."</p> <p>"Do you still have your clothes on?"</p> <p>She sobbed once again.</p> <p>"No, I'm not leaving tonight," she said. "In the bathroom."</p> <p>"Can he see?" she asked me, sounding more interested in watching her daughter than watching her own daughter.</p> <p>"Of course, baby. Go get dressed in a hurry."</p> <p>*</p> <p>"I thought I told him."</p> <p>"You should have. He is the only one."</p> <p>*</p> <p>At the office the next morning, she called and said she had a problem. She was working from home.</p> <p>"I'm not answering the phone. That's fine. Call the number on your cell phone. I'll get back to you as soon as I can."</p> <p>"But... I'm your niece."</p> <p>"You've changed your mind," she shot back.</p> <p>"I don't know what you're talking about."</p> <p>"It doesn't matter. I'm sureâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
