That's what you want isn't it. You want it bad don't you? You want me to fuck them, don't you? Look at them. They're all mine now. Your dick is all mine. And you're mine. That's just what you want right there. Right there."</p> <p>Now, her words were so raw and real that I almost couldn't make them come out naturally. The only thing I could say at that point was, "Fuck you."</p> <p>The smile on her face turned to a snicker when she turned around and headed up the stairs.</p> <p>"What do you say we go into the den and play some more cards?" she asked coyly.</p> <p>I nodded.</p> <p>"I don't see why not. I'm still hard from last night."</p> <p>I gave her a shy "I'll see you tomorrow."</p> <p>~ - - - ~ - - - - - -</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Chapter 10</p> <p>In my own defense, the last thing Sam wanted to do was have sex. She'd enjoyed it too much and wanted to return the favor. I was so horny from sucking her nipples and fingering her wet pussy that I just gave her an honest-to-God, 'Thank you.'</p> <p>I took a sip of my wine, put the glass down and sat up straight, feeling pretty frustrated. That didn't really do much to calm me down. When she finished her first drink, I'd done nearly as good as I was going.</p> <p>She was sitting cross-legged at the edge of the couch, her back to me, and she was looking over her shoulder at me.</p> <p>"You look really pissed," she said.</p> <p>"It's not pissing on you," I replied. "Look, I'm not mad. I'm just horny. I might as well just do it."</p> <p>She snorted.</p> <p>"You want to jerk me off? Or just watch?" she asked sarcastically.</p> <p>"Just watch. You know that."</p> <p>I took another sip of my wine and looked at her.</p> <p>"If you wanna watch, maybe you'd enjoy it a little," I said.</p> <p>She leaned back and smiled.</p> <p>"Of course I'd do it," she replied.</p> <p>I looked at her and saw the look in her eye again.</p> <p>"So, are you gonna let me do you? I don't expect any reciprocation or permission."</p> <p>She was staring straight into my eyes now. She'd turned to face away from me, and I got the impression that she was probably thinking about giving me the same kind of treatment. I could just imagine her, bent over, hands on the wall, fingering herself. Or maybe she was thinking about me while I fucked her.</p> <p>I was thinking about fucking her. I could only imagine what that would feel like and then what it would feel like for my own. She didn't know what she liked, or didn't want, from sucking me and I certainly didn't really know what hers was like either.</p> <p>~ - - - - - - - - -</p> <p>Sam</p> <p>It felt so weird to actually admit it. It was as if it wasn't happening and I'd let something I didn't want happen. In a weird way. I guess at first I still felt somewhat scared, as if the worst was over and the best thing was over and I wasn't feeling so out of my mind. For a person with what I now knew was a twisted sense of humor I was a little pissed, though.</p> <p>At any rate, that was my first mistake. There was no real love for each other. I thought that we'd both enjoyed some good times with each other. We both loved each other, and we needed to be together. There was no real reason for us to be in a relationship, or a serious relationship, or even more important if that really was the reason.</p> <p>But I couldn't stop thinking about her. How could I forget about her? I mean, I'd been so proud to be her last lover, too. I'd never known how much power she was to a man, but now that I was seeing the way she took care of me, I realized that my life wasn't that good.</p> <p>I'd been too timid to make much progress, though. She hadn't really been a bad lover. I mean, the way she'd acted. That was the problem. How I should have made progress with her was up to me at that moment. I needed to take a risk, though, and I had. I'd put my self back down to see if I'd done anything to make her better. I'd done some things. I wanted to get the upper hand so her career as a massage therapist was pretty much all I could afford doing thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
