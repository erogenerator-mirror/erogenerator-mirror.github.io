You need it. It always helps with everything."</p> <p>"This is what you and I are going to do."</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>"And?"</p> <p>She looked into space for a second, looked back at me again, smiled, and looked away again. I could tell she'd been avoiding me ever since she walked into the kitchen. She could have just gone into the bathroom, but that didn't make it any easier.</p> <p>"We're going to make passionate love. I don't care either. If its not what you want, you don't have to do it. I want you."</p> <p>I could feel her look back at me, saw what her mind was and that wasn't fear. I couldn't see her anywhere. I stared at her back. "So what are we doing now?"</p> <p>"I didn't know you came tonight. I haven't come in for a couple hours yet. So what are we going to do?" She said that as she reached back into the drawer and started pulling from it what I felt she was going to need, even though it wasn't exactly what she was looking for, but there had to be a reason.</p> <p>"Just what do you mean?" I didn't really have anything I'd like to admit to, but she needed it. I could hear things I didn't want to admit to, but knew that I needed it and needed to get away from her.</p> <p>"I don't know." I didn't really know if I really cared what she did or if she'd just had a crush on me in some way. I think she wanted to get into what she knew we were going to do and that was that. I thought this was it, but that wasn't the point.</p> <p>"Then what are you going to tell me?"</p> <p>I was starting to feel like her mind was making up her mind, even though I knew the decision wasn't hers. This wasn't about the plan.</p> <p>She looked over at me, picked something up off of the table, handed it to me and leaned over to give me a kiss as I tried not to think about it. Then she pulled back from me and looked straight ahead. "I told you this was my decision."</p> <p>"So?"</p> <p>"So, we are going to make love. We are both going to fall in love. No more 'we' from the end of it."</p> <p>A minute of nothing left to say, then she looked back at me "We don't know if what we are doing is going to make the relationship work. I'll feel guilty about it, but I just hope we can get through it and that it doesn't lead to anything. I think you're right and I want to make it work."</p> <p>I was wondering why she just dropped the whole thing and now she was doing it. I thought I deserved some more from her, and she just seemed to want more, so I wasn't going to argue with her.</p> <p>We got out some coffee and sat in a little circle around each other as we talked. I was wondering which of my choices was the most appropriate. I was worried there would be some kind of conflict between the decision of making out of our relationship versus the decision to actually being able to be with her. If and when I realized I couldn't decide, then that would be an empty risk. I wondered whether in the end it would be either the emotional thing or the physical thing.</p> <p>It took almost an hour before we had finished dinner, but once we got out of bed I just wanted to lie down with her. We didn't have to talk about what we were about to do. It was about the love we were going to make. I just didn't realize it yet, but I just knew that. We did everything we could to take what we needed to, but didn't know how to bring it forward. It was not about taking the time to plan and work out some plans. We were going to make something that would neither of us could get from what we were planning. I couldn't bring myself to think about the plans my mind was going through on our sexual relationship. It was a choice between what we were going to do and what neither of us were ready to do. We would be doing something to make it work before we had to get back to discussing the details.</p> <p>At work earlier that day I noticed that a man who was in charge of one of the accounts had been coming in and making sure there wasn't anyone around to have any problems. I couldn't understand why someone wanted to be that big a distraction. I had my own office and I couldn't see anyone coming in any day of the week. I took a chance and decided that it was my time to come in. I needed some time to thinkâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
