I have no desire nor desire to fuck anyone but my wife. I need to experience my pleasure and be happy.</p> <p>"It's the right time and place," she says and pulls me close once more, our bodies pressed together in a loving embrace. "I love you, David," she says, "I love you very much."</p> <p>After several minutes of kissing, our bodies relax and my cock starts to go soft as she keeps her leg against me. She reaches down and pulls me to her chest, kissing me, her arms around my neck. I can feel her breasts, pressing gently against me and her nipples are erect. She reaches down and runs fingers gently across my cock beginning it to grow once more. "I am so wet for you, David," she says, "you look so good."</p> <p>"I love you, too, Betty." I can feel her naked body pressing against me, her long dark hair sliding across me. It arouses me to no end.</p> <p>She reaches down, caressing my cock, and I can feel her wetness, so hot. Her fingers find the swollen head and her fingers touch all around the rim. I can see her eyes, so green and intense, wide with desire. The light touches, the touches, the soft caresses. She is still very much in charge of me. I am still in control. I can feel the tension in my body. It aches for release.</p> <p>She breaks our embrace and asks if I'd like to fuck her. I'm not sure how to respond to that. Would she be okay with that? No! Would she have the option of just walking out? I'm not sure. If she wants me to fuck her, I want her to love me... to love me, to marry me, to let me be her lover. I have no regrets in that decision. She is my best friend and I love her. She has always been special.</p> <p>"I like it," I say softly.</p> <p>"I love it."</p> <p>"Let me do you," I say, knowing that's my answer for now. She pushes me back so I'm lying on top of her. My cock, still firm, begins to slide into her wet, tight opening. I feel the wet muscles of her vagina clamp down on me and it is only a matter of moments before my entire shaft is buried deep inside her. Once I have fully settled, I feel a little bit of her walls clench around me. I can hold my weight for a while as the last few inches of me move within her. Finally, I can feel my pubic hair rubbing against the lips of her vagina. I lean over her, giving her a quick kiss as I withdraw my shaft until only the head remains inside her. She takes me in her hands and then slowly pulls me back into her. She wraps her legs around me, holding me inside her; she is mine, in heat I love her inside and out. I know exactly how much I've always wanted to do this... to fuck her in the ass... to bury my cock in the depths of her cunt and cum inside her, on her back, on her thighs... anywhere.</p> <p>Her fingers caress my ass cheeks as my cock slides out of her wet, juicy, open pussy. She is smiling a little when she sees my ass.</p> <p>"Do you want me to put my finger in your ass now?"</p> <p>"Yes." She is very excited, knowing what she'll feel.</p> <p>"Yes, please." I slip my finger into her. I can feel her walls clamp down on me.</p> <p>"Don't move," she says.</p> <p>I start to slowly move in and out. Our bodies are still, but our minds are both focused on the act.</p> <p>She has her hand on my ass, touching my ring. My cock feels so good inside her, sliding in and out of her vagina, as it continues to pull me out...</p> <p>"Is it getting hard inside you?"</p> <p>"Yes, it is," she answers. "You feel so good."</p> <p>"Do you want me to put my finger in your ass?"</p> <p>"Yes," she says, "please put your finger there."</p> <p>I slip my finger into her, making sure I've got the desired amount of lube. I rub her asshole, feeling it relax as I apply pressure. Her muscles clench around me and her body jolts up. Her breath quickens and as I feel her ass tighten up and begin to clench, I push my finger all the way inside her.</p> <p>"Oh, yes, David, yes," she says. Her excitement is now in full bloom. "That feels so good."</p> <p>"I'm almostâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
