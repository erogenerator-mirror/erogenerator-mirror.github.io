His fingers parted her lips and began thrusting in & out of her slowly. She could feel another orgasm starting to build. She could feel it starting to build and she knew he was close to coming at the same time.</p> <p>He pulled her panties off her legs and tossed them to the side. He reached under her again, pulling up the fabric of her pants and his fingers slid between her dripping lips. Her breath caught in her throat as her body quivered, and she let herself go. Her body shook, and she held tight to his head as she rode her orgasm out.</p> <p>"Mm mmfghnngn," she moaned into his mouth as she finally let her body go over the edge again. With a final moan she kissed him deeply. "You still haven't come yet," she said quietly. That is not the best thing to say after all, she thought, but I don't care. She slid her panties off, laid down alongside him and lay on her back, still panting.</p> <p>"That was amazing," he said. He kissed her neck and chest. "You are really incredible," he whispered. He continued to kiss her until he felt compelled to make his way down her body. She shivered against his face as he made his way down her body. When he reached her mound he slowly stroked the inside of her wet thighs with his hand. He kissed between them once and slid further into her pussy. His tongue darted out as he lapped up her juices again.</p> <p>She spread her legs to meet his access. "You may touch anything you want," she said simply. She couldn't remember the last time she used words like that to describe herself. She spread her legs to give him easier access as she gently stroked his shoulder and back.</p> <p>"I need to taste you," he said softly. He moved down towards her pussy, but stopped on every inch or so. Gently licking her pussy lips before starting to lick out his way. Her body jerked forward at the first touch, and she moaned. His tongue was in her pussy as he worked up and down her pussy lips.</p> <p>"Oh baby, that feels so good," she said. She grabbed his head and pulled him into her deeper. He continued doing what he was doing. She grabbed his hair with one hand and pulled him in harder. His tongue felt so good working on her swollen clit, and he knew how badly she wanted him to do it. She moaned loudly and squeezed his face tighter between her legs. She was already dripping into his mouth. She began moving against his face as she neared her orgasm.</p> <p>"Baby," she moaned softly, her nails digging into Rick's scalp. "I'm gonna cum, baby." She let loose with a massive orgasm as her body stiffened and shook. She was breathing hard from the intensity. He continued to lick her, but his lips were still on her pussy.</p> <p>"Mmfghgnn," she said again, the words loud and clear inside the room. It took every ounce of willpower she had to resist the urge to bite her lip. She forced herself to relax and she felt Rick shift from between her legs. She felt him slide down her body, and then he was kissing her. Their tongues danced together.</p> <p>"Let me taste you," he said gently.</p> <p>She lifted her hips off the bed and pulled his face between her legs. "Let me taste you." She spread her thighs in invitation and held his head firmly between her thighs, offering no resistance. Rick pulled at her swollen lips a couple of times, and then began moving his tongue around the center of her pussy. This was his first foray into her pussy, and she could not contain herself. She was on the brink of her second orgasm as he worked a finger along her wet pussy and a cocky smile crossed his face in between his moans.</p> <p>The combination of the taste of her pussy and the touch of his tongue were getting her off, and she felt another orgasm building quickly. She pushed Rick away and grabbed his wrist. "Fuck my pussy," she moaned.</p> <p>He looked up at her in surprise. "What? I was just about to put in there." She tried to make a face but couldn't manage a smile as she grabbed his cock. She began stroking it in time with his motions in and out. "God you're good. I bet I could make you come in 5 seconds."</p> <p>"You're too close." He pulled away and moved his cock to her entrance. She pulled him deeper into her, taking him in completely as she ground against him. He felt himself beginning to lose control as she fucked him. She kept at him, not letting up until he had a steady steady rhythm.
