She cried out. It felt so good, the feel of him entering her once more... "I love you," she said. The first time he had said that to her.</p> <p>They lay there in each other's arms until she felt him start to stir.</p> <p>"Oh God." Was all he could say, he was too lost in his pleasure for words. He could feel her body trembling under his and his cock, hard as ever as it came back to life inside her. The heat from her body was intoxicating and it took a moment to calm and begin a rhythm again. He pulled her to him, so that he could see her face; he could see only the eyes that he loved the most, in this moment, with each second that passed by that his gaze shifted from her eyes to her eyes. They were not the usual grey orbs that he saw at home, but somehow so different from the eyes of his other self, these eyes that he could only feel in his heart and breath, each gaze and heartbeats that he felt in his cock. They were the eyes that made love to him and he could actually feel her hands touching his body and exploring him as his own touch continued.</p> <p>Soon the tempo picked up again and he was moving with her in a rhythm of his own. She had taken that as a sign and pulled him in to her in the same movement that he had taken her body. His movements matched hers as their breathing quickened but when they heard their breathing and when they heard their heartbeats and how their chests touched together, it was like nothing that they had ever done before. Her body felt warm and soft and he realised that he had never felt anything so sensual. He knew that the words that he had read in his head had made him believe that this lovemaking could never change his soul and that their love could never go away. This fact was a feeling that could be both a comfort for the other and a thrill whenever they made love but it was still a feeling that they were alive in their relationship and could never be anything else than pure happiness, even after what had happened this morning. She closed her eyes and held him close, her kisses soft as they were, their bodies together in their embrace. She held her arms firmly to either side of him and brought them down to run over his chest, leaving trails of kisses on them as they moved.</p> <p>The kissing, the love and the kissing... it had been far too long, but he could still feel her warmth. There was no need to rush and the two of them kept kissing. His hands moved over her breast, stroking, groping and cupping it in his hand. Their lips moved together and as their tongues battled one another, the kisses became more and more passionate and in return, their hands explored each other.</p> <p>It was at this moment that they broke from their kiss, her hands now toying with his face, his face when hers moved back down. The light kiss that his lips had exchanged with hers was no ordinary kiss. It was different and very fast. She held his head and pulled him in to her. They moved their lips back and forth, pressing, parting and exploring each other's mouths. Their tongues moved with hers in their mouths and the feeling became electrifying. Her hands moved to his sides and pulled her against his body, to which his cock moved on her ass, pressing her gently, trying to get as much contact with it as possible. Their kissing got deeper and her hands were busy moving up and down his chest, down his stomach, stopping to squeeze his ass and kneaded his balls. He had never felt anything so erotic or so passionate, in that they were both so aroused and they were kissing as if it was the most natural thing in the world. He kissed her neck as he moved his hand down to the lower portion of her body, across her breasts and finally down her stomach. She held his body closer to hers as he lowered his lips to her breasts and began kissing her nipples with a renewed fire.</p> <p>She could feel how hard his cock was and her thoughts had been clouded over a few minutes.</p> <p>"I love you..." she said, to which he had to have said that too, though he did not quite know the words to make herself feel better.</p> <p>"I love you, too" he told her.</p> <p>He lay on top of her and their lips met, a long kiss, a soft and sensual kiss that they both felt was perfect. She placed her hands on his back and felt him tense beneath it all, as if he was afraid to move for he wanted more than just a bit of the passion that she felt and he had longed for it. Their bodies were now pressed together and as his cock entered and held her, he felt the heat of her pussy slide all the way inside as he lay on top of herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
