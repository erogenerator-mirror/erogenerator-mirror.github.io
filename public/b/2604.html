She moaned, pressing her hips further forward until he had pushed as far into her as he could go. He withdrew a couple of inches then pushed back in, working her pussy walls like an oiler slowly. In and out of her, he pushed and pulled her pussy by each movement. Her head rolled from side to side, as she struggled on the pillow and gasped out a scream of pleasure as her body responded. Her lips quivered.</p> <p>The next sensation was his cock stretching her hole, and the warmth that flowed along his shaft. She couldn’t tell if it was the feel of him pressing against her cervix or if it was the feeling she was so close to orgasm, since it seemed like every time she opened her eyes he looked like a mannequin. She was staring into his eyes, waiting for his next move; when he looked back at her with eyes that were the most intense, he moved the shaft back and forth a few times then slid it into her hole. He worked it in slowly, just letting her walls close around him, holding it there the whole time until she was moaning, pushing her hips back at him with every thrust. He kept moving his hips back and forth, pushing a little further each time, his cock sliding in an even more intense way than before.</p> <p>After a few more thrusts he let one hand run down her body. She felt it move from her pussy across her chest until it was against her chin as he pushed a finger up into her mouth. The tip of it made her suck on it to try her first taste of a man as he slipped inside of her mouth. He fucked her mouth with his finger, pushing it as deep as he could go, pressing it against the roof of her throat every time he pushed it inside of her. He pushed the finger around until she gagged. She could feel the texture of his finger through the thin membrane separating her pussy and asshole. She tasted the salty salty taste, her mind telling her from experience to go with a clean mouth, that he was filling her so well. He stopped moving his finger, pulling it out, and shoved it back inside. He was still stroking her with it moving in and out, until she felt his cock rubbing against her pussy once again.</p> <p>He pushed in a third finger and she winced. It felt so good. Her body trembled with every nerve that ran through it, causing her clit to jump. With another fingertip he found her G-spot again. It was still quite tight, but she was so slippery inside that it wouldn't give way for much more in one push. His fingers were not used to such tightness, so when he finally slipped a finger into her ass at the same moment she came, she realized that if he could feel her asshole being stretched that hard, he would be able to get his dick in there without pain. She felt a little better now, although he had only used a finger. He slid the finger back out. The rest of her pussy had gone completely void. She felt him move his cock with his other hand. She felt it press against her, and she felt herself pushing back. She was about to cum again and stopped, trying to catch her breath, her pussy clenching around him, waiting for the inevitable. She felt him slide his cock into her with one hard thrust, filling her completely. She felt a wave of pleasure as he did that. He grabbed her waist and started moving his cock in and out of her, making her body move back against him in time with him. Her body was alive now and so sensitive. She could feel it on each slow thrust, the sweat on her back as he held himself within her. He began stroking in and out of her, feeling her come again and again and then again before he finally took hold of her hips and stopped.</p> <p>They lay there, just holding each other as they both caught their breath. She rolled to her side, his cock still in her, their sweat-coated bodies pressed together, their breath slowing as they fought back the emotions they were feeling. Finally he said, "That was good" and kissed her. "You OK?"</p> <p>She said, "Yes. You were incredible" as she stroked him once more. "Was it OK?"</p> <p>He whispered, "You know it was the most intense pleasure I have ever felt."</p> <p>She leaned over and kissed him again, then lay her head on his shoulder while she stroked him a lot harder. "I hope you enjoyed that—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
