It's been several months since I had met her and she had seemed so special to me. On a personal level, we were always in close contact and I never missed our talks. The fact that this was the first time that I had never been intimate with her, though obviously a long time was something a part of it for her, made it more real. I told her that I was very surprised that you never went down on me. She responded and with a wry smile, asked if I enjoyed the process. I told her I enjoyed the moment, and asked if she could do it for me. She said, I'm good with that and asked how it would really be to taste her, I mean her. I told her that I really liked it and her smile widened a little. She started to move towards the door, but paused and asked me if I still wanted to try. I told her I wanted more, and that I was interested in learning how it feels and what it does to a woman. She told you her story, and then returned to the table. I looked into her eyes as she left and asked if you had enjoyed her taste too, she smiled and said "Yes I've enjoyed it. I'd like to taste you some more." I had a bit of excitement about what I saw, and hoped I could satisfy her hunger.</p> <p>After dinner, we went for a walk around the corner. We started the walk through the gardens. Each time she leaned against me, I would let my hands slip and slide up under her skirt. She leaned back against me as we walked a bit more, and I could feel that she was getting a little turned on by the situation. She pushed off my leg so her skirt and stockings were just above the tops of my loafers. As we walked down the path, she turned so I could slide my hand inside her skirt. We had a nice walk and she got a better view of me than most people. She asked if I felt comfortable in our clothes so she would not be a problem. I said, of course. I had to have her. I took my hand from under her skirt and slid it up her thigh and back to her pussy. There was already a part of her that was still clothed, so my hand slid easily into the crevice. I worked her panties and then pulled them up around her hips and off her legs. She had a very thick bush and it was a good place to do what I am doing right now. She pushed my hand away from her pussy and said that that wasn't all that was covered. Her panties were already wet, which I knew and as I pulled them down, I saw a slick layer of juice. I moved right in and she let out a little groan. I asked her if she was all right and she said, "My whole body and my pussy is on fire." I slid an index finger into her and as wet as I could get it, the juice ran between my finger and her lips, up and down her cunt. She started to rub her clit very slowly at that point, and that was my cue. I could tell she was close, so I started to work on her. Soon her breathing got so heavy that her breasts started to move and her body went ridged. She grabbed the back of my head with both hands and pulled me in tight. I didn't want to miss it, so I wrapped my lips around her clit, worked it up and down, and up and down. She had a low groan and she was getting very, very close to coming. I wanted to make her come, so I stopped and said, let's go in there and finish ourselves off."</p> <p>Before I could ask why she would let me make her come, I was out of the park to get to my car and as she was talking to me, I reached in her skirt and started to rub her clit. Our next stop was another couple shops and she stopped again and took my hand away. She was looking down at where I was rubbing her and smiled up at I with the most gorgeous grin of mine I have ever seen in my life. Finally finding a place where she could give me better access, she stood up and kissed me. She said, " I want you to come in my mouth right now." This had me a bit confused. I got out of my car and went over to her, knelt down between her legs and started a little sucking that I have never had before. She reached down behind my head with one hand and wrapped the fingers of her other hand into mine. We pulled each other in and locked lips again, slowly this time. She reached behind me and grabbed the waistband of my pants and slid them off, then stood back up and pulled me to her mouth. She slid the tip into her mouth and her tongue explored my face, jaw, and neck. As she was doing thisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
