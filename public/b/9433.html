I have been waiting all these years and finally it has been mine. You have always been mine," I confessed.</p> <p>We kissed for a bit and then I got me my robe and we went to bed. I was so exhausted after a long day. I felt him start to massage my neck and shoulders and then he was off to sleep, his body on top of mine. I lay there thinking how long I had been waiting for this and so many things could happen for me. I was still a virgin so I didn't worry a bit. I was sure I was going to end up enjoying this every single time.</p> <p>The next week after my vacation, I decided I was going to go back to my room for a while and see if Eric could join us for the weekend after we got back from California. I figured I would go alone while he was still at work to try things. I also wanted an opportunity to play the part of his girlfriend. I wanted to be able to look in his eyes during the week even if he was just looking at pictures of me. I felt like I was dressing and acting different this time.</p> <p>He woke up at the appointed time and was in the bathroom when the doorbell rang and he pulled me out of bed and ran to the door. When he opened the door he was wearing a blue silk robe and his cock felt huge in it. I got back into bed and as soon as he put his hand on my leg and ran his fingertips over my leg I spread my legs and started moaning a little bit. He told me the hotel was so open and had a room next to it. He said he could get us a room and I said "Sure". I said how much he had already paid for my stay and he said that he could get us a suite at a nice resort. And to be an added tip, I am a client of the resort. He said he had never been there before and I said it sounded like such a great place to live. Eric was definitely into this and said that we could come up with something that we liked. I agreed and promised I would be a very obedient young lady and follow any instructions he gave me.</p> <p>We agreed to meet up at the resort on the weekend to get our room booked and we could go right in. The resort was about a mile from our home and it was not far from where we lived. We planned to go for a walk along the river and just sit and get lunch and talk, before heading back to the room. I asked about our next move and he said we could stay as long as we wanted. I couldn't believe I had agreed to this and said, "I can't believe you have agreed to this". He said that everything has been so exciting, we can just talk for awhile. We agreed to meet at the resort on the week of our wedding and Eric said that we had about six days to have some fun before going to our honeymoon.</p> <p>That weekend we went to work and bought some new clothes and picked up some new toys. It was great to watch our new neighbor while my husband was away. This weekend Eric was in the store and I started doing the same. Eric said he had to go to work so I bought some new sex toys we had never seen before. I told him what did they do to me and he told me to do the same to him. I started with a long string and a rabbit vibe. I thought that it looked kind of gross so I just pulled it down. Then I got to the tip and put it in my mouth. It was the most exciting thing I had ever done. I did what I had done for other guys and enjoyed the feeling of having a male in my mouth while he was there so I could do the same for other females. After about an hour we had to go back to work. I wanted to stop and kiss Eric a bit but he said he wanted to wait for a couple hours. That we would have to walk all the way from the hotel and have some fun before we had to leave.</p> <p>We met up with him in a bar just across the street from the resort and he showed me the room. I really felt like a newlywed now and I was going to enjoy the days ahead. Eric took my hand and pulled me closer to him. Now I really did feel at ease and didn't feel embarrassed at all. We were both in our early 20's and were looking forward to our week. We had both agreed that we would go to the resort together and talk while we were gone. After he got a drink and we started to talk about our new neighbor, we started going over our day. It was a really good time. We had sex all weekend and didn't have much time before we had to go home. The first day went perfectly and in theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
