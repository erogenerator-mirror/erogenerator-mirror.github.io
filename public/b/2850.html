It isn't like someone's gonna get back with me in bed. So can you tell me what you plan on doing with me in my time of need?"</p> <p>"Do you want to go to the ladies room or the kitchen?"</p> <p>"Ladies room?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess you are gonna get the use of the bathroom right now."</p> <p>"I really don't have time for a little fun. Go ahead, I think I have a date for my first real date. I'll just wait outside."</p> <p>"Okay, then, we get a cab back over here."</p> <p>We got back to the bar in no time and started drinking in the bar. There was no one else in the place. I don't think there was even anyone else in the club, except the bartender. He had his arm around my waist so I was holding on to him very tightly. He wasn't being possessive with me, but he was being careful not to lead this girl into a whole new world of sexual desires, and I couldn't help but enjoy his touches as a sexual partner.</p> <p>After about an hour or so, he told me he was a little thirsty and told me to go to the restroom or he would let me know when he was ready to let me get out of those clothes.</p> <p>I was still in my dress and heels which seemed a little odd but I was actually pretty decent looking with no marks on my body in my current condition. I decided to follow his lead and got back in my dress and heels. I took my phone out of my purse and started playing some music and even dialed my phone. If either one of us had chosen any of that music at the time, we would have found an empty bar or booth in the middle of the floor. I thought about just trying it, but knew that was way to risky. Besides, the way I looked at you was so sexy when I was feeling horny or frustrated.</p> <p>When I got back to the bar, I saw that the man had left the room by the front door and gone into the back room. He came back a few minutes later with a couple of glasses of white wine and told me that his friends had just left and they were coming over. I took one glass over to him and sat down at the bar and he started making conversation with me. He started at a lot of my personal information, but he also asked me about my experiences with women and my sexual encounters, and other details that I didn't remember. Then he went on to tell me about his ex fiancé, his divorce and how her husband was cheating on him. While talking, he kept pressing his lips close to mine and letting his hand brush my breasts when he would pull me closer to him. I was starting to feel really horny when he finally moved his hand to the side of my neck and pressed my head closer to him.</p> <p>I didn't know what to feel. I wasn't sure if I felt any sexual feelings in my chest and face that way, so I just kept trying to stay in control of myself, not trying to touch him. I had a tingly feeling down my arms and felt my nipples get hard as he continued to slide his hand up and down my back and thigh where he was touching me. He wasn't pulling my skirt up, but certainly not all the way down. He stopped and pulled his hand away and let his fingers slip under it to cup my leg. I jumped a little in surprise because I was in some sort of sexual euphoria.</p> <p>"This feels like a lot of fun." He told me.</p> <p>"Oh really...what happens at the bar is not a place to play that kind of games."</p> <p>"No, it isn't a bar. The people at the door must be having a few drinks. In fact, I think you've been having a few drinks yourself since you got here tonight. It must be after six in the afternoon. That's around the corner from the other end of the bar in our little back corner. The music from the other end of the bar is a little louder. If it starts to slow down there must be the sound of more drinks coming in your glass."</p> <p>"I'm not too drunk."</p> <p>As he was talking, I had stopped and was slowly turning towards him. When I saw his hand slip into the pocket of his jeans and pull out the top of a business card, I realized that he was probably trying to get me to give him a show. It wasn't a show like he got from any other guy. He was looking me over and touching my leg when he whispered to me, "Do you like dancing, Cindy?"</p> <p>"Yeah." That is when I realized that I may have—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
