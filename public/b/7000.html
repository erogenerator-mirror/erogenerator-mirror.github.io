"So much power." The smile on his lips was gone, and she was looking at his eyes as they looked off into the distance. He felt his heart skip. "I mean..." He started to protest. "We can't. We still have to, we won't, we really can't." But, her grip tightened again, so his face was quickly back to normal. "I'll be honest with you though." "Don't you worry." He kissed her forehead. "I promise. It'll keep us out of trouble though for tonight. I'm sure we can work something out." They broke their kiss, and they both laughed a little as they looked each other in the eye for a moment. "Are you sure that's what you want?"</p> <p>"I'm sure you're sure."</p> <p>"Good!" They both quickly got off the chair and got to their feet. "We'll see." They both grabbed their shoes, then went upstairs.</p> <p>The three of them went in search of the bathroom to continue their discussion.</p> <p></p> <p>Later on in the evening they all sat down on the sofa, sitting a small table out on the patio overlooking the ocean. "So...what's next for us?" They had been debating on a couple of things, but the topic suddenly came up between them. They broke out in laughter as the girls went to the bathroom together for the evening. He looked at the table to see that they had picked it up from the table where they had been sitting when they sat down. "Well, I guess it's time we took our vacation to New Jersey, eh?" As they went back to their seats she turned her head slightly toward him. "And I guess that's the end of that discussion. This is where we're going to start on our honeymoon, and then come back for a second honeymoon." The smile that crossed his face as she leaned in toward him brought him back to reality. "We're going to set up some places to vacation with our families, our business associates, and even a restaurant. Then we're going to be there every night for the rest of our lives!" He looked her in the eyes and nodded.</p> <p>"Oh, that sounds wonderful!" He leaned in closer and kissed her gently. "How is it going with your parents?"</p> <p>"You can say that." "No they're ok, just the two of us."</p> <p>"Alright. They're home and are spending time with their children...I mean...not all of them..no, but it will take us time as well." She had a big smile on her face.</p> <p>"You've got another thing in mind here." His eyes danced around the table, as he looked at her. "Yes, I think it's time we move on! So? I'm ready to head back to my room."</p> <p>"Yes" was her response. "I'm ready to go also." She reached for her purse and pulled out her keys.</p> <p>"Alright." He took her hand and they pulled out. They pulled out of the airport and on up the highway, then quickly headed back to the motel.</p> <p></p> <p>The first stop was at the airport where they would spend their first month there, then the next day. He had rented out some of the rooms for the three of them, but also had picked out a couple of the best motels in the city to have them. In the end they were back at the motel at about 5:00 the following week. When they got back, they could see that they really were tired. The motel was a couple hours from their home so they decided to go home.</p> <p>"Can we get some rest, please?" He leaned back and closed his eyes as he put his head in his hands. And he began to drift off to sleep. "I don't think we've gotten that far with your kids, yet!"</p> <p>"I know, but we still have a lot to do. I think we'll make the most of it."</p> <p>They got their bags down the concourse of the airport and headed down to the hotel. They grabbed their room keys and headed out with Jake on her back. They could hear him saying something to someone as they drove, but it was a muffled conversation that couldn't possibly be heard over the sound of their engines in the motel. When they got back to the hotel it felt more like five minutes. When she stepped out of the car, they checked out of the hotel, had our luggage picked up in the limo, then they were on their way back to the resortâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
