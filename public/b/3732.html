"I really love you. I want to make sure that as our marriage goes on and you go to work, we can have one hell of a great life together. I know you have to go through some tough times, but don't worry. I'll be taking my responsibilities seriously."</p> <p>We lay there together for several minutes before I realized that he had fallen asleep and was about to doze off with his soft lips and the light. I rolled over and looked at him before I closed my eyes and drifted off to sleep. I woke with his arms around my waist hugging me and pressing his morning erection between my butt cheeks.</p> <p>"Oh, my," I moaned.</p> <p>I reached into my nightstand and grabbed a warm wash cloth and a towel before I covered him with my own before I got in bed.</p> <p>"I could get used to this," I said with a wink before letting him know that I meant it. It really felt too good not to let him stay.</p> <p>We lay in bed for a while until I realized that I had actually started to have feelings for another man. And then it was my turn to have feelings for him. As a couple for sure things were going to be really interesting, just as they were going to be awesome, so I had to let it go a little.</p> <p>He kissed me on my mouth before he pulled me onto my back and climbed on top of me. I was still pretty wet and ready until he slid into me with a resounding thrust. It felt like heaven and as he slid into me I felt another man. My first real partner ever with no warning.</p> <p>His cock was long and as well as long and as nice as it had been in the past. What I felt on the inside was a mixture and a mixture of feeling and longing and something else I could not quite quite place. I couldn't quite tell if it was just my head and his or if I felt something else in me, but I just kept thinking of that, what it was that had caused the change in our relationship. I didn't think that it really mattered how we acted.</p> <p>As he continued to slide in and out with smooth short strokes, I felt him pull me close to him until he could feel my breasts pressing into his chest. Then he pulled all the way out and slid back in. I was in heaven. I could feel myself starting to get excited again already as he moved in and out faster.</p> <p>He was fucking me harder and faster with each thrust. I could feel him getting bigger and I could feel everything and it seemed that he could too. I felt my pussy start to clamp down on his cock. I couldn't tell if he felt my pussy on his cock as well as my own as everything went on for quite a while. We were both getting louder and I was starting to feel an orgasm starting to come along.</p> <p>He pulled out and I felt the sensation start to subside just as I felt my own orgasm start to build. He came behind me to where I could feel him sliding into my rectum. When his penis was all the way in I told him I was going to go back to sleep. He rolled off me and I felt the pressure on my asshole.</p> <p>"You really like that in all holes," I asked him with a grin. "That would have been a big turn on in some of the years we've been together."</p> <p>"Really. It gets me off like I wouldn't believe. You're too hot and right now I'm ready to go back to sleep. Besides, the last thing I want to do is piss you off."</p> <p>As I said it I knew it and felt it and the way I felt myself, and my desire to feel him cum in me was going to make me orgasm again. "I just love what you've done to me. I think that I'll be wanting it as much as you now."</p> <p>"I always was a horny old woman," he said.</p> <p>He started to kiss me again before he rolled off of me. Just after I felt his cock start to slide out of me I felt a cool drop at the hole in his scrotum.</p> <p>"I could make a great boyfriend of yours!" I offered. "I mean with all these thoughts going through my subconscious mind. If you had come in here and I was lying in bed and you were just laying in my arms or you're in my bed, I'd have had a chance to kiss you but you didn't."</p> <p>He got out of bed to find his pants. He looked around and I didn't hear a thing.</p> <p>"Are you going to be okay?" he asked.</p> <p>I told him I loved him and hoped that we could stay friendsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
