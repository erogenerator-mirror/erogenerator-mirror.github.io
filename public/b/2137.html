I told him.</p> <p>"Oh, you have no idea how you do!"</p> <p>"Thank you. Now let's go make ourselves a nice meal for later!"</p> <p>*Part I*</p> <p>It was after nine in the afternoon. The place was quite busy but the crowd had thinned. The main gathering was in the reception area of the club that was on the top floor of a multi-storey house. The men and women were just being served drinks and chatting to friends and other guests that were dancing. Some of the men had left the dance floor as it was only about half past nine.</p> <p>My boyfriends friends were just starting to get their tables ready with drinks. It gave me another reason to drink with them when dancing outside their place. They all wore their fancy night dresses, and I looked like a slut. I could have been a hot little tart at the beach, and so could they, but they had to get in that position with me.</p> <p>It was at this stage that I heard my boyfriends friends shout down at me. "Don't be shy!" One said. "I'll take her!"</p> <p>"No need," another said, "I'm sure you'll enjoy her!"</p> <p>I could not refuse one of them an offer like that; it was all I could think of. And here I was with a gorgeous young woman at home, a man I found I fancied and wanted to be with in the short time I would be with her. In a way, there was something else in these thoughts.</p> <p>I could not see what was happening there, and the men in the dance floor were now trying to find some way to keep the lights up.</p> <p>The music was on and it sounded to me like someone was dancing with the young woman. Her skin shone through the thin material of her low-cut nightdress. I had never imagined that anyone looked like that before and I had never been very close to seeing a woman so sexy. As I watched them dance and move together, I did my best to keep up with them, but with my own excitement, I found it hard to keep up.</p> <p>We danced for nearly half an hour, and then the two girls joined us. We looked at each other and smiled at each other knowingly, but our dancing was a little different to that of the dancers. All the men and women looked at the young woman, but did not seem to look at us.</p> <p>When we had finished our third full drink, my boyfriends friends stood and approached me. They asked me to dance. They gave me such a drink you could drink it without stopping. They seemed to be trying to convince me to go out with them, but I rejected them all.</p> <p>I was still dancing with the young man, who was a tall young man, but looked like he might be about twenty. I could see him checking me out as we danced, so I said yes. I still think I would have agreed to anything. I was not going to say no, but I was going to keep dancing. When the man asked me if I would dance with him, I said that I would do so only if and when he asked me to. He was interested in me, and I was.</p> <p>I danced with him for over an hour, and he came once or twice to dance with me before we left to get something to eat.</p> <p>We went back to our table, and once again he asked me to dance again. But before we left, he kissed me. It was a tender kiss. I wanted to resist it, but it felt so hot and passionate. I wanted him to kiss me the way he had kissed me when we danced. I did not resist my boyfriends friends asking me to dance with them, and I did not resist the kiss. I danced for him, and he did not resist.</p> <p>I had a feeling I knew where this was going. That there was hope for me in his eyes. There was hope for me here.</p> <p>The music stopped and they asked for the young man from the dance floor, and he thanked them before leaving.</p> <p>They then held hands for a few seconds, and as they let the man go, they held me close, and I felt their firm bodies pressed to mine. I could not resist the feeling. I felt the strength and love for each man. I felt my boyfriends wife clinging to me like a life partner.</p> <p>Finally, we left. When we got to the car I told her that I would have to leave her alone. She said she would be home soon.</p> <p>"Would you mind?"</p> <p>"Not at all, darling" she smiled.</p> <p>She hugged me again, and we kissed a little more. I was so excited at being with this young man again. I was happyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
