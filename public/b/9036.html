This will be a long night, I promise. I'll go to the bathroom and wash my hands. When I return you can help me clean up."</p> <p>After that, we went to the shower together. We cleaned up and got dressed. Once we were dressed, he helped me out of my chair and walked me straight to the bedroom. When he dropped me on the bed, in the dim light, he put his clothes back on and began. He put on his own clothes. When he returned to me, he pulled me into his arms. With his arm around me, he leaned down and kissed me. He laid his head against my neck and laid his hand over my breast, squeezing it. I was already feeling the first stirrings of my own desire. "Honey, I'd love to just take off these clothes and stay with you. But I would really rather I be left with you."</p> <p>"Honey, I'm just as horny as you are. I'm sorry if I upset you. But now that I'm with you, please let's just take our time and enjoy this."</p> <p>"It's been a while, and I can't wait anymore."</p> <p>We stripped completely. There was only one thing left to do. Before taking off our shoes and socks, we got back to the bedroom. He gently removed my pants and shirt. I stepped into my shoes. He undressed and hung up his clothes in one of the closets. He stepped back into the bedroom and stood over the bed with his shoes in his hand. He looked down at himself and laughed, "Well, did the neighbors think I was in the shower?" "Yep, they were all right."</p> <p>He dropped his shorts and stepped over to the bed and sat on the edge. "Honey, you know why I'm doing this? I mean, this is not the first time I've done this." "It's not? Are you trying to fuck me?"</p> <p>"Nope." He sat there and watched me as I moved closer and closer to his cock. My hips were still a little out of my league. "I just wanted to watch. You know, for my own enjoyment. This is all just a fantasy for me. I just want to feel it. Let me put it into you. Make you feel good. It's not that I want to do this to you, but I've fantasized about doing this to you."</p> <p>"I'm glad you're thinking of this. I could never agree more." When I lay myself over his lap, I was in his lap. His cock was pressed against my pussy. He sat still and just held me. "Honey, it's not that at all. But I do love what we're doing." I turned so my back faced him, "and I don't doubt you'd like to just continue to make love to me, do you?" He was stroking my thigh which, from what I could see, held no excess hair of any kind.</p> <p>Suddenly, I felt a hand on my ass. It was my husband's. He massaged my ass, just a few inches from my pussy. He slipped two fingers inside and began to rub my pussy. I opened my legs a little to give him better access. I didn't think I could handle this. I just stood there.</p> <p>"Ohh, that feels great." I turned around and put my arms around his neck. "And it looks like you've got everything else to do with the rest of the job on my body you've had to do with my ass." I lowered myself down to his cock. I looked into his eyes as I engulfed both of his cock in my own body. The smell of cock was intoxicating. I wrapped my legs around his waist and he held me up, holding me close. The feeling of that dick in my own pussy was nothing compared to the feeling of his.</p> <p>I looked him in the eyes as I began to rock up and down, going up, down, up, down, faster. I knew my husband liked it that I was doing this for his own pleasure. I continued to look into his eyes as my orgasm approached. It was my own turn for a reaction.</p> <p>"I haven't had anybody that's ever felt this good." He began to pound me faster.</p> <p>"I'm cummmin. Do you want me to pull out?" I nodded. Before I could turn myself back around and continue the ride down his cock, his cock exploded. I saw his face contort in pleasure. I felt his load shoot into me. I was glad it didn't putrid me. It felt good on my pussy. But then I couldn't resist. The pleasure was too greatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
