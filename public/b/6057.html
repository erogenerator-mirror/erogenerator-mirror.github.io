She was so much taller now than when he last saw her, and now she almost made eye contact with him. The way she looked at him and pouted and flickered her eyes at him made him want to ask her all kinds of questions but it was difficult. She was all he could think about, and he almost had to kiss or get a blowjob for it. He would never be able to keep up with her. He would probably never make her cum. It would be all that he could do before she fell asleep. And if she did, she would do it all over again. When was the last time they had made it? They had done it twice. Twice and once, twice and once. And the first time he got her off by coming in her mouth, and then he came in her pussy and she kept on coming until she was exhausted.</p> <p>And she couldn't possibly come again. And she would never let him. He could almost promise himself to not put it all in her. To put it in a way that made up the rest of her. But he would have to put it in a way that was just so good for her that he would have to make something up, a way to make her come again, a way that would make her come again. And while he tried, he still couldn't. She had never asked him that of herself and she had only known that she should make love to him, but how could she do that when he was doing something, or trying something that was hard? She thought if she played the game, he would win. And if she were to become something else, she could at least start the game again, if that was what it took. She just couldn't do that. She thought she probably could just kiss him. Kiss him like she always did for his sake; kiss him because he was the only one who knew how to kiss her. She really didn't know how she was going to do that.</p> <p>But he would win when he looked at her, and she knew that he must have figured that out. Even if she didn't see her for two seconds and then they both looked away to the end of the sofa so that her hair cascaded over her face and down to her feet, that would certainly be the most exciting. They would have a great laugh as she did it. They would both do the same, as if, and they could just watch as they did it.</p> <p>But if he won, that would just be too difficult. If she didn't win, so what? That was the way. She didn't really have a choice. They would be kissing with all those emotions on their faces. If she was able to kiss him, if he kissed her, he would get the worst shock of all. She didn't really mind. No, she loved the chance. She didn't have to do anything. He would do it to her. And, if she would actually win, they would be kissing. And she was sure that he would probably have a hard time holding off the excitement. So to win, he needed to have two kinds of things happen. If he won, he could give her the two kinds of things that she was sure he would want in the end if he won, and he could still win the other kind.</p> <p>She didn't really understand how he was winning. She had never done anything like this with anybody, but just that she liked it. She even thought that it was the excitement that made her go. She knew that he would still win. She would be just as excited as she wanted to be with him. The excitement would have his heart pounding as if he were going to die in her arms. Not that she wasn't willing to give him anything to take his mind off things. But she still needed to win, or at least to make the game more exciting. But she needed to win, and in her mind there would always be something else she would want. She might not even want to do it again. She might still want to have sex with him just as much as she wanted to have sex with him. They could have sex forever, but that was the only way to win.</p> <p>But if he let her start now, it would be no contest. That would be all that was needed. Then she would have to think of something else she would want to do, for him. But if he won, she could keep winning. She might still win. And there would be something else that she would want to do. And she could still win. But if she won, she would let him have everything he wanted. He would always win.</p> <p>But she would still love him. She would need to look back and remember how she felt when she saw him win the game. She had loved him. She had seen him fightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
