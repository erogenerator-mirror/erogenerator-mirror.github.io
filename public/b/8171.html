"I'm not your girlfriend."</p> <p>"Well, yes my ex-girlfriend and I were going on a one night stand before I moved on," I smiled.</p> <p>"I'm sorry! If I was your girlfriend, I'd be pissed," she said.</p> <p>"No, you're not my girlfriend, you're my lover. It's not like we haven't done this before," I said.</p> <p>"Ok, I like what I hear. I hope you don't mind?" she said trying to make a good impression.</p> <p>I just pulled my shirt from my pants and it fell off, leaving me in just a t-shirt. "It's ok, it's not that bad." She laughed nervously.</p> <p>"I know you just want sex, that's all," I laughed.</p> <p>"Is that what you want?" she joked.</p> <p>I shrugged. "You know I think you're cute, but you just aren't the type for dating your ex-boyfriend." It was a cliché, but I was actually more interested in her face than her body. "I'm not gay?" she shot back.</p> <p>"No, you're gay," I told her.</p> <p>"I don't have a boyfriend either," she stated, "and it wasn't like I had the whole school year. So you do want to hang out?"</p> <p>"I don't know if I do, but if you feel like doing it and I'd like to, you're out of luck, because you never know," I told her. "Besides, this is kind of nice."</p> <p>"You're just saying that to get me into your pants? Yeah, that's kind of hot, right?" she smiled. She was obviously trying to tease me.</p> <p>"Well yeah, I'm a bit of an ass," I giggled. "It's just that you're the one I want to hang out with."</p> <p>"Yeah, right, maybe I'll hang out with you later."</p> <p>"Goodnight," I said.</p> <p>"Goodnight," she said, kissing my cheek before we shared a kiss.</p> <p>"Goodnight!" I said.</p> <p>"You're in a hot dress! I was going to ask you to dance, but I can't dance," she said and then left. I just grinned. It was obvious I wasn't in a relationship, but I liked how she moved around the dance floor without taking time to dance. It also made me feel good about the way I acted.</p> <p>The next few weeks went by quite the way that things had worked out. I was having a few drinks before she left, but it was almost like an old boyfriend and I was just making it up. The first month was always fun, and I would meet a few of my friends if they came by. My first couple of dates turned very interesting until one day they had come by to visit. I had stopped at one of the booths and ordered a drink at the bar. I ordered what most people call a Long Island Iced Tea and sat down. A beautiful girl of about fifteen walked over and sat down next to me.</p> <p>"Hi," she said sweetly. "Long for you." I couldn't help but smile when she handed me a cup of tea.</p> <p>"Sorry, this must be our regular drink," I told her as I set aside my cup. We talked for a few drinks before she asked if I was all right with my date. I told her that I wanted a man. She said she didn't mind if I wanted to date a woman, and then she added that she hadn't felt too comfortable with a man in a while. As she finished her last drink, she smiled. I couldn't believe we were so alike. It was a little awkward, because she had gone first, but I finally convinced her to let me take her home with my date.</p> <p>As we walked her home I couldn't get over how happy I got to be with her. She was a very sexy woman, and I couldn't believe how much I enjoyed being with her. Her breasts bounced with each step she took home. The way they moved made me feel so special, yet so awkward at the same time. She led us down the hallway and stopped at the bathroom door. She looked back at me and said, "Come on." I started to get up, but she pulled me back down. "No don't. Just sit." She didn't say anything else. She led me in to a stall and sat down. I stood there, trying to figure her out, for a second, but my heart was racing. She was sitting at the toilet, facing me. She unbuttoned my pants and then reached inside and lifted my cock and started—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
