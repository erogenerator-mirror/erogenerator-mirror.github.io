He growled menacingly.</p> <p>The tears began to flow again.</p> <p>She looked at the ground and slowly shook her head.</p> <p>She said softly, her mouth open. "Do it and see for yourself." He laughed and turned to the bed, walking toward it.</p> <p>She sat watching his ass then turned onto her back. He had a smug look on his face as he approached her and she saw his hands start to caress her stomach while his lips wrapped around her lips for a moment and she couldn't help letting out a moan.</p> <p>He moved her mouth to his then stopped, moving toward her, his hands running slowly over her body.</p> <p>His hands moved from her breasts, down to her thighs, where he pushed them wide apart. He rubbed her pussy a little then reached around her to remove the clamps. He then bent and suckled on the hard buds, making her cry out and her hips move involuntarily. He then pushed two fingers up inside her and was amazed at the tight fit and her moan of pleasure. He then leaned in and placed both of his hands on her breasts, caressing them and squeezing.</p> <p>Her eyes grew wide. "God." She said and shivered as he moved his fingers from her and began to run a finger up her clit.</p> <p>"Yes darling." Hissed him as he felt her start to push up against him with every motion she made.</p> <p>He watched her body tremble and watched in the mirror as his fingers moved in and out of her, her muscles contracting and relaxing as her body shook uncontrollably. She could feel his fingers moving in her all over and she could hear his deep voice and his body moving against her. She pushed her hips to meet his and pushed into him, feeling her orgasm building. He stopped moving his fingers up her pussy as her body began to tense. He moved her over just a little and she moaned and whimpered as his fingers entered. It was then she heard him move and felt his cock pressed up between her.</p> <p>He pushed in easily and she almost screamed again and started to cry as he drove into her, causing her to push back towards him.</p> <p>"God yes...." He moaned and kissed her deeply, her body quivering in front of him.</p> <p>She cried out as he entered slowly, then pushed in hard a second time, causing her body to quiver. It was almost an in and out motion that drove her over the edge. They both heard it in the mirror again and her moans became more frenzied. He slowly began to increase his pace and she continued to moan as he drove into her over and over, grunting with each stroke.</p> <p>He wanted to hear it again, but the image of his own mother fucking her own son, as he knew it would send him over the edge. With a final thrust his body went over the edge and he exploded inside of her, the feeling of his hot cum flooding into her pussy sent her over the edge as well. He felt her hands move to his back and she began to move gently against him, feeling him still inside her.</p> <p>She heard the sound of them moving and it made her feel so warm and safe. She heard the sound of lips on her neck and felt her heart beating and knowing he was moving with her.</p> <p>When she felt him pull out of her, she knew.</p> <p>He leaned down and kissed her once again and she felt the love of her son in her arms.</p> <p>The Endâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
