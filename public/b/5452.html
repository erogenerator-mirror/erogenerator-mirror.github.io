I looked around the small room as he took in my cock from head to base. I was surprised to learn that there were no other people there and I noticed that the couple at the bottom of the stairs was still completely naked, but it only took a second for his wife to walk in. It was too late to hide anything since the couple had been in the room in the shadows of the living room. She walked up to me as I was staring at my cock and said, "He sure does have a great cock," and then proceeded to drop to her knees. As she knelt in front of me, she reached out for my shaft and slowly stroked my throbbing head. Her eyes were on my face and I could tell that she was loving what she was doing. I could tell that she was getting to the point where she was in charge of the situation so she leaned forward and wrapped her soft yet plump lips around the head of my cock and gently sucked on it. I had already been stroked plenty of times by my wife but I was having trouble imagining my cock in her mouth tonight. Her soft mouth wrapped around the head of my cock while her large hands gently stroked my shaft and I knew that I was about to feel something I’d only dreamed about in my dreams. I didn’t know it was about to happen, but I wanted my cock in her mouth.</p> <p>Just then my wife came back into view and she quickly pulled up her jeans, grabbed her coat and put on a coat, saying, "I have to run. I will see you later!"</p> <p>As she was leaving I noticed that she had left her bra in the front of the coat where it had sat while talking to his wife. I smiled to myself and realized that I had to do something, if I was going to satisfy myself tonight. I walked towards the elevator and could feel the juices seep from me all down the inside of my leg. I climbed in the elevator and walked right up to my penthouse. Upon arriving at my condo building, I was so hot that I didn’t care who saw me, just that the idea of being caught aroused me every time I thought about my fantasies. I pushed open the door to the front of my condo and walked up to the top and rang the doorbell. Just as I started to say something to nobody came knocking on the door. I started to close the door and there were two people behind it. At first neither one of them showed us much; it would only be a moment, but shortly the three entered the room. I looked at them and could only see the three of them sitting in a very large couch, a couple of chairs and I assumed that they were all still naked. When they saw that I was watching, I smiled and said, "Hi" as I stepped around the couch and placed my arms around their necks. I had my hands on their shoulders as I spoke and they looked up at me and my hands were lightly running across their body with their arms wrapped tightly around me, as I kissed each in turn, one at a time. I could feel their warm bodies against mine as I placed my lips to their ears and gently said, "This is my husband Steve, he joined the army on the 7th of July for the Marines.</p> <p>"He was very handsome, but he is not much of a military man, just a mechanic, a housekeeper or salesman. He is not what you would consider your type at all." I started to move them towards the couch saying, "Steve, this is my wife Susan, Susan, Susan, Susan, Susan." I followed a line of their arms as we spoke and then stood up. Susan had already pulled the covers back, revealing her naked body to my admiration. I quickly turned around and grabbed her from behind as Susan pulled me closer to her and kissed me, softly at first and then increasing their passion and kissing. She pulled away from me after a moment saying, "We had better get this show on the road. We have plenty of time."</p> <p>Before I could turn back around, Susan pushed me back down to the couch and said, "Don't sit down, I love you," and then kissed me again before she stood up. She walked around the couch and sat down on the floor next to me. She put her right leg over my left leg and leaned into me and kissed me, saying, "Steve loves to kiss and feel me up, so let’s get him a little warmed up on that big—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
