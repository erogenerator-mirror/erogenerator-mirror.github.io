He was erect and thick. He looked down at himself and said, "I don't know why this is happening, but I'm really not turned on by the idea of having a man's body fuck me."</p> <p>"Well, there's no harm in getting some pleasure out of it," I offered.</p> <p>He looked back at me and said, "I guess we've got it all worked out, eh?" He gave his cock a rub with his fingers and then leaned into me and kissed it. "That's better, don't you think?"</p> <p>I did. "You seem to like my body."</p> <p>He laughed, "No, I didn't think it would be that hot."</p> <p>"What?" I asked.</p> <p>"He thought it was hot, and I'm glad I liked it."</p> <p>He pulled his pants and underwear off and took off all of his clothes. In his underwear, he looked even better than the pictures I had seen of him. He stood there for awhile, just looking at me, as I got up to my knees and crawled over his body, and began kissing his legs and then taking off his shoes and socks, and then his briefs, kissing the insides of his legs and licking his groin where it began. He closed his eyes and lay back on the blanket. I slowly began kissing up and down his body and he moaned and writhed, so I gently pushed him back on the blanket making him kneel on his back and spread his legs apart. I then stood up and slowly rubbed the head of my cock slowly up and down his length, taking his pre-cum and stroking him into my wetness. I reached back and spread my lube onto his beautiful cock, rubbing it across his lips and then down his channel and along the crack of his ass.</p> <p>"Oh, damn," he said.</p> <p>I stroked faster until I came with a long groan of pleasure. I slid my condom onto his slick cock and climbed on top of him and slowly worked my cock inside him. I lifted up on his legs and began fucking him. His moans were getting deeper. He lifted his body up while I slowly worked my shaft all the way in and out. I reached between my legs, and started pulling on his hair, which was hanging down and rubbing the soft skin of his face. I could see it, feeling it. It was all I could do to make him hiss out at the site of my face, my own body, and then look into his eyes. He looked into me, into his eye, as he pushed my face down to his and kissed me long and deep. He pulled back and looked me in the eye, smiled, and said, "Yes, I like that, yes I like that."</p> <p>All of this time, I was slowly stroking him, his cock as we kissed. I looked back at him again, still fucking him with my cock, and said, "Did you like it, what you saw, didn't you? I can't believe how fucking hot you look, I can't believe this is really happening."</p> <p>He smiled and said, "I love watching you fuck him and when his cock gets hard, it looks so sexy and arousing."</p> <p>"I hope so," I said. After making out a little while longer, I rolled off of his body and lay on my back on the blanket, taking him in my arms and giving him a deep kiss.</p> <p>The next day, we fucked a long time before I knew it.</p> <p>Next day, I fucked him again with enthusiasm.</p> <p>And when I returned to my hut, it was clear that we had a little trouble. He was now wearing a pair of loose gym shorts, with a tank top and a pair of briefs, which I found very sexy. "Well," I said to him, "I have got to run a little early, before I change my ways."</p> <p>It was just barely a whisper, so no one in the village knew my name, though neither of us cared. We got dressed, gathered some sandwiches, and ate our dinner. Afterwards, I helped him off with his clothes when the smell became stronger. He was still quite a sight in his shorts, but I never told him that.</p> <p>When I had his clothes off, I pulled the waistband down over his cock and put my head on his crotch, which caused it up, and then down and around. I took his hard cock into my mouth so that it looked the whole length of mine.
