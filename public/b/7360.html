We were driving past a nice house that had a nice garden, on Park Lane. Not too dark, it was a fairly nice road, so there were fairly few people in the road. The car was a nice white Ford. But it was too old for this. And it would likely burn out quickly when it got hot, so I had to take it back to my house to sleep on a Saturday night. I'd been planning to have a fire started on Sunday, but this was a good time for me to bring some firewood!</p> <p>I had been thinking of calling the garage and letting her know that she could come over tomorrow night, and I wondered if she knew where she would get her fire wood when she came.</p> <p>Anyway, I got there about half an hour after I put the truck in park and it was already hot in the car. It had an extra floor, so in the car, I got the box spring and went into the kitchen to get some wood. I put some of the old and dirty pieces of wood on the fire, burning on to heat quickly, before I put the box spring back on. I took out a fire wood and got a bunch of matches, a couple for the fire. I looked at the car, which was still hot, and then thought "That's probably better." After heating the wood, we got back in the truck and set up the wood. I took the rest of my clothing off while she took off her clothes, and I took one last look in the back seat and, almost immediately, put my underwear on too. I got a quick shower, got dressed and headed out toward the fire. My daughter was already sitting there, reading the paper, sipping her wine.</p> <p>"Wow," I said, and said, "I can't believe you forgot to put these on."</p> <p>"Oh, no I'm not," she said, "I just brought them for a rainy day."</p> <p>"So, do you want to see the fire or not?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'd like to go and read to a book, but I have to make a phone call first," she said as she stood up and started getting dressed.</p> <p>"Yeah, probably a good idea, isn't it?"</p> <p>"Yes, it sure is, John."</p> <p>I sat a while before I had to go in to get a piece of wood, and came back out to see her. She looked at the book, then at me, and back to the fire.</p> <p>"You're going to give me a beer to warm up for a while," she said.</p> <p>"You've got beer in the freezer."</p> <p>"You have a beer in the freezer."</p> <p>"What, I wasn't kidding."</p> <p>"It's a good thing I'm a beer drinker," I joked.</p> <p>"You can't hold on to it for long," she said as she got into the kitchen.</p> <p>"Yeah, I can," I said, "and that would make it more convenient. You can warm up more easily."</p> <p>She started setting the table and started working the stove. While I was doing the other things, she came back out to start the kitchen. She was looking a bit uncomfortable, but she wasn't saying a thing about it or anything.</p> <p>"So what do you think about this fire?" I asked.</p> <p>"It's a good one, too, but I have a feeling I've never done this before."</p> <p>"It could be good," I said, trying to steer her in the right direction of the fire. "I'm doing it a bit for old time's sake."</p> <p>"John, I can explain," she said, looking up at me with those big blue eyes. As she looked up there I could see her starting to smile, which she looked over at me with those big blue eyes of hers.</p> <p>"What's this one for?" she asked, taking a piece of wood. It was a really cute piece.</p> <p>I looked at it, then down at myself.</p> <p>"This is supposed to be a really good fire, to set the mood, but I don't know why you're putting up a fire," I answered, "and you're wasting it. Just sit back and relax a moment," I said and went back into the kitchen.</p> <p>"John," she said, "could you please tell me about how old the fire was that time we were here? I don't need to be at the fire right now."</p> <p>"Well, that's where we'll start," I said and went out on the deck. "I need to start getting wood in back of the fireplace."</p> <p>I went to the fireplace, poured a glassâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
