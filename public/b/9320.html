We should get her out back."</p> <p>"I'm here."</p> <p>"Get out."</p> <p>"I'll be back in a couple."</p> <p>"No, let's just go."</p> <p>He nodded and followed her out of the store.</p> <p>It was a pleasant, warm summer day; she was feeling as relaxed as if they were on a date.</p> <p>"Why do you think I am here?" she said.</p> <p>"Are you mad at me?"</p> <p>"I wasn't going to tell you what I am so you wouldn't be angry."</p> <p>"What do I have to do?"</p> <p>"Just go, and just do what you have to do."</p> <p>"I'm glad you told me."</p> <p>"You said I needed to get out," he explained.</p> <p>She looked around the store again. "I wonder if I should do it. I am so used to being at home by myself sometimes."</p> <p>"I don't know what I would say." He said.</p> <p>"I am used to walking around topless sometimes, as I do to see if any women are in stock."</p> <p>She laughed and walked away. They walked on a little trail for a few yards to the nearest tree. She turned around. It was covered and lit up like that, so they sat down. "There is a bench that's always there," he said. "There is a little bench over there that's more comfortable."</p> <p>"No, it's no problem."</p> <p>They sat down and enjoyed a couple of hours of idle chitchat. For the next half an hour or so, neither one of them said anything until he stood up and said he had to get back to work. She stood up and followed him.</p> <p>"Where are you going?" she asked.</p> <p>"I'm not going anywhere," he said. He stood and walked behind her for a couple minutes before stopping. He looked around and got a handful of towels. "Wash me?" he asked. Not knowing what to do, she sat with one knee up on the bench and used her other foot to wipe the grease off her body.</p> <p>While she was doing this he reached under her and pulled off her bikini top and held it up to face the wall. He had a washcloth and started to wash her upper body. He worked each hand and it almost felt as if she was doing the wash with her body. When he was finished, he dried her with a couple towels and got her back on her feet.</p> <p>"You did not wash it well."</p> <p>"I would have. But no, this is fine."</p> <p>"You are doing great. I just thought maybe you would like that."</p> <p>"You have no idea."</p> <p>He took off his own swim trunks and got the water started. He watched her do her body with some pleasure and smiled. He felt a wetness run from between her legs and down his leg. It was too late to turn it off. She pulled down her swim trunks and got onto the water while he sat on the bench with his hand wrapped around his penis. After several minutes of this, he decided it was time to take up his position so he climbed on the bench to watch for a while and got her back on her feet. Then he sat back down.</p> <p>"Do you need to use the toilet?" he asked.</p> <p>"No, I can use it."</p> <p>"Do you want to leave it outside."</p> <p>"That would be nice."</p> <p>"OK," she said. "Turn around and sit down for a few minutes and then we'll just sit and watch the sunset."</p> <p>Not needing any more encouragement, he turned and sat back down.</p> <p>"Do you mind if we take it out for a while?" she asked.</p> <p>"Just stay where you are!" he laughed.</p> <p>"I don't mind, I like being naked."</p> <p>"Ok," he said. He sat back down and watched them. They watched each other in silence for minutes before he got up.</p> <p>"Let's start swimming again," he said. "And we should get to it before the sun goes to hell over," he said.</p> <p>"Sounds good."</p> <p>The water glowed brightly in the sun. He started swimming slowly. She followed him back to the bench and sat down. He followed her. They watched the sun for a little more time before he pulled her head down and kissed her. Their lips touched briefly but then pulled away with a little tongue. She was startled but didn't pull away.</p> <p>"I want to seeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
