"How about we go for a drive and see how far we can go from there, we go to our cars and drive a little further."</p> <p>The next day as they walked to her car from the pier, they stopped short of where they intended to go.</p> <p>"I have a car," she said. "You can't drive with that thing."</p> <p>"It's no problem," I said with a laugh. "I brought it today with me. I wanted to surprise you with it."</p> <p>"I'm glad," she said as her blue eyes gazed me up and down intently. "You can carry it in if you want."</p> <p>"Sure," I said, taking its seat. "Do I need some sunglasses because you look so beautiful here?"</p> <p>"They're in the back," she answered, looking around at the empty buildings they walked up to. "I guess this is as good a parking spot as the parking lot."</p> <p>"Is that another reason we're here?" I asked. "We're here for the best part of an hour."</p> <p>She had already noticed the place had a few other cars there, and she had been paying rapt attention, even giving me a sidelong glance, when the car came to a stop at the curb in front of us. It looked to be a two story old building, and her hand came up to pull the blinds down, to ensure she didn't see any lights outside. "Here we are," she said, smiling, a little too much at the sight before her, "but I'm not sure we'll see much unless you park right there."</p> <p>"Where's it anyway?" I asked. "It's pretty secluded."</p> <p>"Sure isn't it. Why do you ask?"</p> <p>"You've got a lot of questions," I said, taking one of her hands in mine. "Besides, I don't want you to be embarrassed by anything we do here."</p> <p>We walked up and down the street, our eyes still locked on each other for a few moments as we passed by. My wife's hand was so soft and smooth, even in the dim light of the street. It didn't dawn on me for a moment at first, but then I suddenly looked down at the large silver car in front of us. The rear light seemed to glow a little more; the driver's side window was slightly fogged up. I hadn't noticed that before, when we were walking to pick up this guy, he had stopped and was standing next to her as I entered the driver's side. I looked around as I backed out from the corner of the street and out of sight.</p> <p>"Wow," I said. "What would you like to buy at the grocery store?"</p> <p>"I don't think we can afford a whole lot of groceries at this price," she said as she opened on the door for the other guy.</p> <p>"Don't worry about that. I'll pay for the groceries," I said, extending my hand toward him. "I'll get you a receipt or something. Just sign your name on it and say 'Thank You'. Okay?"</p> <p>Looking at mine with the car as we left, she took the card and signed it.</p> <p>"See you around then," she said as I leaned her the door and closed it. "I think you're a pretty nice guy."</p> <p>I shook his hand and then watched as she turned for the other car and drove away. "What would you think if I just bought this guy a car for himself?" I thought to myself, as we both looked around at the other vehicles. "A guy who's a lot older, than myself?"</p> <p>"If it's a good car for the price tag, you can bet it will take him at least 60 to 70 years before he wants to sell for the money," I answered, trying not to let on my secret.</p> <p>"If it's a good car for the price tag, I'll bet it'll do you all right," she said with a smile. "How much do I owe you?"</p> <p>"That depends on what you're looking for," I said with an awkward laugh in my voice. "Or where you're from."</p> <p>"Well, I'm from Atlanta, so how about we buy a new car today?"</p> <p>Her eyes sparkled as she reached across the car and gave me a gentle squeeze, before adding, "Actually, we're going to have to take a longer drive."</p> <p>The drive from Tampa to Nashville was fairly long, for all of us, and I was glad to get back on the way she'd picked from the first time we'd met. At least we had one car the first timeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
