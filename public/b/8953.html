Do you have a glass as well?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes please. I think I need a pee," she laughed.</p> <p>"No, I want to get drunk, I want to look at you."</p> <p>"Ok, let's go."</p> <p>They walked toward the back of the bar. He put his glass on the bar and turned around to look at his friend.</p> <p>"She likes it, doesn't she?" Matt offered.</p> <p>"I really do, and you guys know that. She would probably be all of us if it were her doing what we did."</p> <p>"She must be a crazy girl, but she doesn't like to fuck in front of her best friend." Matt added.</p> <p>"Yeah, it sure is worth trying. I think she'd want me to join in on the party."</p> <p>"How about you come with me and we'll give it a go?"</p> <p>"Yeah, sure, and I'm sure I can dance with you guys, I would really like to feel you guys."</p> <p>"Ok, have a good time. Just remember, if you come to the party, you're just going to have the most fantastic night of your life." Matt said.</p> <p>They all laughed at what they said, and followed him back inside of the bar and back toward the exit. He grabbed the last beer from the bartenders, and handed it back to Mary, who was watching him. She said a bit of a 'thanks' and they all stood up.</p> <p>"Come on with me," Matt said, leading his friend to the ladies room.</p> <p>Mary followed Matt around the bar, making sure to look at him every chance she got. He was tall, very muscular with a very nice ass. What looked like little bulges were growing on his legs. She felt a stirring, but she kept those thoughts to herself. She could never put her finger on what she felt for Matt. She took a deep breath. It wasn't bad, really. She had sex with guys that looked like Matt, who looked like him. Mary leaned in very close and said, "You better not touch yourself, you see me?"</p> <p>They entered the men's room together, and Mary closed the door. Matt walked toward her so she could reach him.</p> <p>They were in the handicap stall and he undid his pants and she lowered herself onto her knees so he could remove his pants.</p> <p>"Well? What do you think?"</p> <p>"I think my lips would barely touch your pussy when I'm sitting down like this. It would be so intense for both of us."</p> <p>"Yeah. That's pretty intense, isn't it?"</p> <p>"Absolutely."</p> <p>They both unzipped their pants, and helped each other remove their clothing. Mary reached back and rubbed her hands along Matt's abs. She then reached back and undid his pants while they were kissing.</p> <p>"I can smell your arousal. I want to taste you from here."</p> <p>"Then I want us to make love to each other."</p> <p>Matt lifted his head, looking at Mary's face. It looked as though he were about to burst. It was a look that said she was about to blow him on the spot, and he definitely liked that look.</p> <p>Matt pushed Mary back onto the tiled floor of the stall, and went to his knees. He pressed his mouth against hers, and his tongue began to explore her mouth. He pressed his finger inside her pussy, and began to finger fuck her. She moaned into his mouth as he pushed two fingers inside her and fucked her with them. As he kissed her hard and deep, his other fingers began to fuck her. She grabbed his head and pushed his face into her pussy while he was finger-fucking her.</p> <p>Matt felt her body tighten and could feel she was about to climax. He pressed harder and faster into her pussy and she began to quiver again. A few more thrusts, and she yelled out, signaling her climax. She felt her body tense, as though her pussy had a mind of its own. She was cumming hard, squirting a long continuous stream of liquid from her pussy, which he lapped up.</p> <p>Matt stood up, with Mary leaning against the side of the stall. He wrapped his arms around her and pulled her into an embrace. She laid next to him, not wanting him to leave, nor did she want to hold him and feel his strength.</p> <p>"You are so beautiful. Thank you," Matt whispered, as he kissed her softly on the lips.</p> <p>They held each other for several minutes as their breathing slowed a bit, and their hearts slowed as well.</p> <p>"You were so good to me tonight. I can't say that we do much without each other," he told herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
