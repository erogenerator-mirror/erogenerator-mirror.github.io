He was looking around the room, he seemed interested in everything around him. "You just look so amazing."</p> <p>"Thank you, sir!"</p> <p>Mister Big stood, his robe coming off revealing his naked body. He was tall, well over six feet and in good shape, dark hair, green eyes, and a strong body. His dick was long and thick, his balls hanging low and firm. He had a nice sized cock, just under the average size and he had shaved it a little, making him very popular with the ladies. The guy thought to himself 'let's see, let's see!'</p> <p>He walked up to the bar, where he sat on a bar stool. The lady behind the bar was a brunette. She was dressed in a tight, short, tight teddy, and just the right amount of stockings; he would notice them the moment the right garter belt caught her leg.</p> <p>The bartender was very cute, dressed in a white, short, button-down, shirt. It was tied around his neck and he had his back to everyone. He was holding a drink, and when he saw the lady behind the bar he put it down, then he noticed she wasn't looking at him.</p> <p>"Handsome!" The bartender yelled, then turned to her and said, "So, how's the party going, ma'am?"</p> <p>She turned back and smiled at him. "Pretty good, but the party's almost over." she said, and she was standing behind the bartender who had stopped and taken a sip of his drink. She put her arm out to his side, inviting him to join her, as he turned.</p> <p>He put one hand around her waist and lifted her off the stool. She took his hand and started to follow them to the dance floor. "Are you sure everything is okay with me?" he asked her, trying to calm her.</p> <p>"Everything is okay, Mister Big." she replied with a smile and reached her arms out to him.</p> <p>He stepped in front of her and pulled her to him, then started a dance. "I can hardly dance, but damn you're a fine dancer!"</p> <p>"And a terrific dancer!" she replied.</p> <p>They danced, his hand on her ass, she in his. When the song was over, he stood up and pulled her up and they walked back to her seat. "I think the girls have an opinion of all of this." he said, giving her a wink and a slight smile.</p> <p>"Oh no, they're not doing anything right. I've got a great boyfriend with a nice cock." she said, taking his hand and leading him into the room. The other women's and male friends were at the party.</p> <p>After the first dance, she came back with another friend, then she and her new friend headed to the bathroom. "Have fun?" she asked, leaning close and giving him a peck on the cheek.</p> <p>"I can't wait." He said, kissing her again.</p> <p>The next dance had them in a classic '69' position. He had one arm around her neck the other on her back, her leg over his lap and his dick in the crack of her ass. She grabbed his face, kissing him, his fingers sliding up and down her pussy, massaging her clit.</p> <p>"My mouth is watering for cock!" she moaned in his ear, "But he can wait!" She took one leg off the counter, then the other. "Your right. Do you have any lube?" she whispered into his ear.</p> <p>"I'd rather have something warm and wet."</p> <p>They entered the bathroom and she shut the door, turning on the spray to make sure it was warm. She took one hand and began to wash his dick, then she moved it around, teasing the head.</p> <p>The second she moved her hand slowly up and down his shaft, he let out a moan and grabbed her ass and pulled her closer. She took his dick into her hand, then stroked it up and down, then in and out until it was slick. Then she guided it to the entrance to her pussy and rubbed it around until it popped through her lips. "Oh, please fuck me!" she begged.</p> <p>He pulled her against him, then she stood up and pushed him up against the bathroom wall. The water came over them, as he lowered her to the bath, the tub being on one side with the shower head on the other. Slowly the water washed over his body, the motion of her hands as she washed his cock was a sensual experience. Each time he felt her hand on his cock, he moaned into her mouth, then she kissed him and they continued their passion by kissing as the water washed over them. It didn't take long until they both came inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
