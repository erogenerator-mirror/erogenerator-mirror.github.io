Can't I take a chance?" She asked but was afraid to ask.</p> <p>"Anything you wish," I said, taking all the time she needs to understand what I'm trying to say.</p> <p>"I have always regretted that I never knew about guys."</p> <p>"How do you know about guys?" I asked.</p> <p>"I love to date guys, even better than you. I've had men at that club of mine who wanted to be in my bed, in my bed."</p> <p>Before I knew it I had grabbed her hand firmly and was pulling her away from the table. As I moved her hand away I pulled my shorts down and her hands covered her face. When I got her to look at me again I was looking at her mouth, I could tell from the look of fear that she had not said, but my finger trailed over her lips. I pushed her lips around my finger and she began to suck on it.</p> <p>She pushed back against my finger, letting out a little moan and I removed my finger from her mouth.</p> <p>"You were right about the men. Not all of them are like that. They want their women to be happy just the way they are. That's how the club is set up. That's all I know how it works," I told her.</p> <p>"I've never had that in person," she said, but I could see her heart beating a little faster and that made it seem that much more likely.</p> <p>"I'm glad you're glad," I said. "Why don't we get back to my room before we miss breakfast?"</p> <p>"If you don't mind my staying here, I'd like to leave for a minute. I'll be right back," she said and got up.</p> <p>When we got to my room I set her on her feet a second time, "Don't you want a little time to get better at your studies?" I asked.</p> <p>"Don't worry about that. If you just need your energy to study and not worry about my grades there's always a little more room here."</p> <p>"There's a bit I need to get my mind off of that. I mean, what do I do after school on Friday anyway when everyone is gone?"</p> <p>I laughed. "It's alright, if I have my mind on something other than studying. I'm not sure how much it matters, but you still have the time, but if you want you can watch me if you want. If it doesn't make any difference you can go to your room too."</p> <p>When she agreed to this I took a sip of some bourbon I had brought down to New Orleans from the house. "I've got to start getting ready. Will tomorrow be okay?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess. I should still get up around 6ish to go eat," she said. "I'm going to call for breakfast, then check my emails, then I have to get up early myself, after all that takes a lot of energy."</p> <p>"I know, I just felt bad about what happened, about not being able to get up early for work. I feel bad about my dad getting on my nerves that you were so worried that I would sleep with anyone. We shouldn't have done anything together, we know that's wrong, but you have to understand that I couldn't keep my hands off you. That you wouldn't have stayed married to me if that's what it turned into," I said.</p> <p>"You're right, I didn't want to lose you over something bad. I've never been unfaithful to any man before but with you I feel safe and secure. I would never cheat on Dad," she said, trying to reassure me.</p> <p>"Maybe you should be getting up early tomorrow and go shopping. That way if there is anything you want to do I might not be in the way."</p> <p>"You know it's hard on me, being away from home," she said, trying to joke with me. "After the way all those men in my life treated me when I went into the shower, I never thought you would have done anything. All those men came in here thinking that I'd let them get away with things."</p> <p>"If you are going shopping with me tomorrow I want you to stay here, at least for a few hours. I didn't really have any clothes on when I came home, and I probably wouldn't have worn them until I was ready to give them back. I want you there when I go to breakfast."</p> <p>I went into the bathroom and got a towel and dried my hair. Since it was early I didn't bother doing anything with it. I went to my room and picked up my phone. I checked my email so I wouldn't be so lazy going to breakfast. It seemed like an hour laterâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
