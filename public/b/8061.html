She has been a part of my sex life ever since I first met her."</p> <p>I knew that was a lot to hear but couldn't bring myself to say more.</p> <p>"So, do you want to do it again?"</p> <p>"Maybe. I am still in a relationship but we will have sex soon enough but I have a lot of other things in store."</p> <p>It was a relief knowing that I would be able to let things go but I was still surprised by how forward I had been of making love to Cathy. I could not put it down to her and I was glad that she had been of a similar sexual nature in her past sexual experiences. I decided that the time had come to ask her what she was up too.</p> <p>"Cathy" I told her.</p> <p>"Yes?</p> <p>You will have to tell me all of it before you do."</p> <p>"I guess I don't have to do something with you before then."</p> <p>"That's alright, we better just be careful."</p> <p>I kissed her on her cheek and walked her to the bedroom. As we got to the door, she said, "I am sorry about last night. It was a mistake. I hope I didn't give you as long a good time as I did," before she had the chance to say more.</p> <p>She got the shock of her life when I had her sit on the bed and pulled her into a passionate kiss. I wanted her to realize she had been in a relationship for years and I hoped she wouldn't be able to deny what she was feeling for me. I thought that I would try to teach her a thing or two when she felt like she was being treated unfairly. I took her hand and pulled her onto her back, "I want you to know that I will have you if you really want to be my next girlfriend. I hope you are looking forward to doing it again."</p> <p>She was surprised by how forward I was acting but she gave me her best smile and replied, "My dear, I will try to accept and cherish the pleasure that you gave me. I guess I will have to have a few questions about other people first. For now, I have to find out about your plans before that happens."</p> <p>I kissed her once again and let her go so that I could get a chance to think about my next girlfriend. To my surprise, I was not worried about her interest in me until I tried to figure out why I was doing so. I had been attracted to her for the years that I had been with her until the early years of our relationship. I thought that all three of us were going to be in a relationship. I was sure that none of us would be able to hold a relationship forever. I tried to think how to tell her that I was in love with her but would only do it with her. I was a little afraid of what she might say when I had decided to tell her that I didn't like what we had done as much as I liked to make love with her.</p> <p>I was happy to hear that even if she wasn't happy to hear I wasn't going to tell her that I didn't like how it felt. She also didn't seem to be very happy about it. I tried my best to reassure her, as I was willing to admit it even to myself.</p> <p>The day took on a whole new dimension as we were going through the door on a Saturday afternoon. She had asked me to give her a quick tour of the house, but I had to wait until after dinner to do it.</p> <p>As we walked around the house she asked, "Did you expect me to stay in the room?"</p> <p>"I didn't think I could keep it up as long as I thought it would."</p> <p>She smiled at me and said, "If you had stayed with me, I wouldn't have changed my mind about leaving you with me."</p> <p>"Do you have any plans for the weekend?"</p> <p>"I will have to wait until tomorrow for the usual stuff. I just want something to remember about this new relationship together."</p> <p>"If you think of anything for me to wear tomorrow I will pick something that fits it. I know that you would prefer to wear a bathing suit."</p> <p>I gave her a huge smile and replied, "Just don't expect me too much else tonight, because you are going to have me just as soon as I get home."</p> <p>She said nothing for a minute, "I couldâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
