I say smiling at her as I slide my hands up beneath her shirt. "How is this for money then?"</p> <p>"Good. This will be our first dance." I smile.</p> <p>I pull back my hand to her right breast and run it along its shape, feeling the hardness of her nipple through the thin fabric. I run my hand up between us to cup her face. Her eyes are on fire, as if to claim me. I have never been one to be the passive type. I'm not the type to look at the prize before any woman. I am not the sort of man to be the recipient of female attention. I'm merely the prey of the predator.</p> <p>Penny jumps back against the window frame and slides her arms around me as if she were trying to devour me. We kiss again, a long lingering kiss that sends shivers up my spine, but when it starts to build up in my lower regions I don't care.</p> <p>Her hands slide off my shoulder blades. I love her soft hands! It is so hard to look at something that is not there. All I can think of is the sensations of her hands on my skin... the feel of her hands on mine. She pulls her lips from mine, kissing me again, before pulling me forward to kiss her again. We kiss as passionately as I can remember it.</p> <p>I reach over and unbutton her short skirt. Her body is covered from hip to shoulder. She's wearing white lace bikini panties which are cut high over the top. Her backside has become very smooth and I can see that she is wearing a lacy white garter belt. I slide my hands over her cheeks as I kiss her neck, taking a breath.</p> <p>"Let's go." She whispers. We quickly make our way outside to the small deck.</p> <p>"Let's go take a shower before we really get our clothes."</p> <p>"Okay." She says, with an inscrutable smile that matches her eyes. I follow her to the shower. A large wall is to the center of the house. I grab the bar of soap and begin to wash the suds away from her body. I slide my hands over and around her legs. I reach up to her breasts, sliding my fingers along the hard tips.</p> <p>"I'm sorry if I've been a little forward." She says.</p> <p>"Of course, dear. You can't stop now." I smile and kiss her lips. Her hands drop to the sides of my face. She runs her fingers along the lines of my lips and cheeks. They look so soft... so gentle, as their fullness makes their way into my eyes. Her lips curve against my ear and she whispers into my ear. "What I'm about to tell you is, yes, it was all a dream."</p> <p>I'm in a daze over what Penny has told me. After all, I have known her all that time. My heart is beating even faster. The heat of the moment is so intense that it burns itself into my cheeks. I've been the subject of thousands of people's fantasies, in stories and in stories of erotic fantasy and they are still in my head. For a moment I was afraid to tell the truth, but now... well... I'm afraid I will say the wrong thing.</p> <p>"But you'll understand, Penny." We finish up our shower. I dry her off and we get back into bed. We have the best sex I've ever had. Every part of my body is alive and I know exactly how to please her. She has become so beautiful and so desirable; so warm and kind. She has become so perfect and I just adore her... well... I love her. I don't know what's wrong with me, but I'm afraid.</p> <p>Chapter 23</p> <p>There is something about going to the movies with Penny that changes me. I love the way she looks when she is with her long legs wrapped around me. I know she's been with a lot of guys and probably most of them weren't good for you, but... it is... well, you know... something else. And when she says the word pussy, I just know I've heard it in those quiet moments of silence that women have when they don't want to breathe. I'm sure it is true, but she has an aura about her that makes her seem fragile and fragile at the same time.</p> <p>When we get back to the bedroom, Penny is naked and holding on to one of my arm's as we lay on the bed. "I know I should have said something, but... I was looking... well... you know... looking at... you know... thinking how much I would like to have that in my life... to be... like... like this forever?" She says in that same sexyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
