I'm almost your age," she said, and I laughed.</p> <p>"No, I'm not, and if it was so that one, I'd have let you in me, but I don't regret sharing that experience with you," I said, not meaning it.</p> <p>She paused, smiled, and kissed me.</p> <p>"Let's go inside," she said and we got up and went inside.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p>"So, the girls are up?" I said as we finished our wine.</p> <p>"Oh yes, what will it be?" she said.</p> <p>"I want to go to bed with them. What, do you think it's okay for me to tell them the four of us have the sex?"</p> <p>"Uh-huh. I don't usually go to bed with them, but that sounds like fun. Can I ask you to share them with me?"</p> <p>"All that can always be shared with the four of us..." I said, thinking about how long ago it is that I can talk a woman that way, but if you want sex later, let's just say not too soon. Of course, there's no going back. You should know that by now.</p> <p>"I was thinking about asking them if I could, I mean..." I reached out, and put my hand around her arm, which was still around the back of her head.</p> <p>"You'd better, before they do something stupid," she said, and reached up, and pulled me closer.</p> <p>I felt the warmth of her mouth on mine and my hands went to her bare hips, and then up, over her dress, around the back of her thigh, which was bare.</p> <p>I pulled her to me, hard, and kissed her deeply, as I rubbed her belly, sliding my fingers up and down her side, over her breast and over her other nipple.</p> <p>My hands dropped to her ass, and she let out a little gasp as I grabbed her ass, her dress bunched around her waist.</p> <p>"Take these off," she said, and I undid it, and let it fall to the floor.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Take it off," she said. "Get naked. Let's go to bed. We will take full advantage of you.</p> <p>She was right at the moment, I guess. In bed, she kissed me, and put her hand up under my chin, and took my head between her hands.</p> <p>We were both in the state of nakedness. We were on the bed. My cock, which was hard and stiff, was hard at her crotch, she pulled me to her.</p> <p>It was hard at her stomach. I felt the softness of her vagina, which I noticed, she had a hairy bush. She was wet, and her lips were swollen, moist, waiting for me.</p> <p>She took my cock in her hand, and pushed it to her. I felt her vagina open, and her vagina was full of my cock. She held it, and made me slide in and out of her with her hand. My arms went around her, and she pressed herself down against me. I held her, my cock in her vagina, with my hands. I felt the muscles of my penis rub against her. She had a hard little clit, and she was rubbing up and down on it.</p> <p>It was hard, with her pubic hair and her clit. My cock was in her vagina, and it was stiff and hard all around. She was pressing her lips at me, and she was kissing me, hard, as I rubbed her clitoris with my thumb.</p> <p>I rubbed my penis against her clitoris. She moved her hips up and down on me, and I had her clit in the palm of my hand. My thumb rubbed the hard button.</p> <p>She lifted her mouth off of mine, and put her arms around me. I felt the first quiver of excitement in her vagina, as she took me inside with her hand.</p> <p>"Mmm..." she moaned in my ear. "Oh yeah."</p> <p>She was in a state of ecstasy. She had come, and she wanted the sex of a young man, with his hand in her vagina, her hand on her clit, moving on me like she was riding a bucking bronc, and her vagina was on fire for me.</p> <p>And we were right there.</p> <p>She opened her legs, to let my cock slide out, and to take it backâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
