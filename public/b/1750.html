"It's a hot one." she whispered. That didn't sound like a sexy statement, it sounded like a slut saying it. She tried to focus, but it was difficult.</p> <p>"No, it's... it's not that." he stammered, "I have a thing for hot women. We've both been trying to talk about it."</p> <p>She thought for a minute. "What's your thing? I mean, you've been thinking about it for weeks, why wouldn't I be thinking about what we were talking about?" Her nipples stood up, tenting her shirt. "Do you want to talk about what it does to me?" she asked, her excitement rising, even though she hadn't been thinking about anything since last night.</p> <p>"Oh yeah right there. Of course I want to talk about it." he answered.</p> <p>"Yeah, I think I'd like to talk about it." She was pleased with the answer, but there were just a couple of things that needed to be done. "You can talk about it anytime you want. Just call me. You can do anything you like to, anything at all." she told him, before going back to the door.</p> <p>She closed the door and took a minute to figure out how to talk to him. She knew he liked talking about her. He liked to go on about his conquests. He liked her, but most of all he liked to go straight to sex.</p> <p>She stood in the bedroom, looking through the various drawers, pulling her clothes off her body like any common whore. She pulled on a sheer, black top and a see-through one that would expose her ample cleavage. Her legs were bare and she was glad to see all of herself. She sat cross-legged on the bed, waiting for him.</p> <p>He sat on the edge of her bed. He could see her nipples were hard and visible under the thin material of the top. Without asking her or saying a word, he stood up and quickly pulled his pants down. It was the first time he had ever taken his cock out, and he had already blown a little of it this morning. "Hey!" she said in a voice that was as loud as his head, as he stood there in just his boxers, a huge tent protruding from the dark fabric.</p> <p>"Umm" was all he could muster.</p> <p>"Just get your pants off so I can finish getting naked." he said. She obeyed him and stood up, before he got his cock out again, he could see some pre-cum oozing from the hole. She knelt down on the floor in front of him and took the wet member into her mouth. He felt the warmth of her mouth, as well as the hardness of her lips on his shaft. His cock immediately began to twitch, he could hardly take it anymore. "I'll never get this done", he warned her.</p> <p>As she was sucking him off in her house he had to look at something. He reached back to her and took a moment to look through all of her wardrobe. He could clearly see her top was a see-through one-piece. He could see that her nipples were rock hard and sticking out about an inch or so. He could almost see the outline of her hard nipple with her hard nipple pointed at him. He could see just how wet she was and how much she was enjoying herself. His cock began to throb again, as he took a final plunge from the depths of his trousers. He released a stream of his white thick sperm out of the tip of his cock, that continued for about a minute.</p> <p>His orgasm slowly tapered off as he looked at Ms. Miller. "So?" he asked.</p> <p>"So?" she asked once again.</p> <p>"What are you thinking about?" he asked. "What has been going on that you've been thinking about?" he asked.</p> <p>She thought for a moment, "I have been thinking about what we should do, and we've talked a lot, and I really can think of something we could do that would be just as bad as we try." she answered.</p> <p>"Well, I have to admit I have never done anything like this before." he said. "But I can't imagine doing any of this at all."</p> <p>"You should try it some time. I'm sure you will enjoy it, it's just that it would be great to try again." she said as she sat back and leaned back on one hand. "I'd love to see that." she added with a smile.</p> <p>"I'm sure it would be great to try it again. But I have to be honest, if I did anything like all this before, I wouldn't have a chance with you right nowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
