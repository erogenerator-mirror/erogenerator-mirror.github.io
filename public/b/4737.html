"Why are you watching me?"</p> <p>"Because you're fucking my wife, so I'm watching again."</p> <p>"No, she's my wife. I told you."</p> <p>I walked over and put my hand on top of his, squeezing it hard as I stared him down. "I'm not your fucking wife."</p> <p>"I will be! And don't worry about being with anyone you fucking want," he said, grinning.</p> <p>I started to laugh. "You're the only man I want to be with. I'm just your dirty little slut."</p> <p>"That's what she calls you!"</p> <p>I grabbed his arm again and pulled him away. By that time, his cock was sticking out even harder than when we started. I pulled my panties aside and slid my dripping pussy onto his cock. "I'm going to fuck you, you son of a bitch! Now, I've got my hand in a fist pumping it."</p> <p>I heard his groan and, with his hips bucking, I had him all the way into me. A gush of fluid came out around his cock and he pumped it back into me at the same time. I started to rub some more of his cum on my clit and realized that he had been right when he said about no one could have me. I hadn't realized how hot I was becoming. I came again, my head back, eyes half closed and panting.</p> <p>I was completely spent, but I was thinking what a nice guy I'd been. I'm a great fuck, but my pussy started to tingle. God, that feels so good. I want you to fuck me! "That must have been the only way to fuck a woman," I thought.</p> <p>"Why don't you take off your panties?"</p> <p>"No. I think this is turning into a little more than just fucking. I want to fuck you again."</p> <p>I pulled off my panties and I was wet with sweat. "I really want to fuck you. Do you mind sharing?"</p> <p>"No. Let me get your other panties."</p> <p>That was it, I thought. We stripped right there. He put his hands on my ass and slid his own cock into me. His cock slid in and out of me like a pistoning cock. The friction was intense- I was so turned on that when he fucked me I could feel my pussy walls tightening around his cock. He was grunting as he fucked me, as my body was quivering all the way through. Finally, I could feel his cock swelling and his balls getting tighter.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum," he said. "Go ahead and cum."</p> <p>I pushed back against him and felt his cock throbbing inside of me. Just then, I felt it. It was one of the strangest orgasms I've had in my life. I felt so full I couldn't even think properly. I felt the warm fluid running out of me, down my leg and onto the floor. I was trembling so hard I thought I was floating. After it was all over and we had calmed down, we got dressed and moved to the shower. We never looked back. We had this weird dream and we ended itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
