"Well...umm...what are our options?" I had the feeling that this was a normal question, like something I should have been asking.</p> <p>Nervously, she answered. "You know what I'm doing, Mr. Big."</p> <p>"You're doing what you can do?" I thought that was going to make it even harder for me to get a move on her, but she didn't say anything.</p> <p>"Let's go see what happens." She smiled. "Maybe it's time we start over."</p> <p>Well, that was certainly not going to happen for me, so I let her put on her robe, which fell to the floor. I got a handful of tissues and we started taking our clothes off. I was naked and she looked so perfect in this robe that my cock immediately went hard. I was a little stunned to see that she also had a strap over her breast, though.</p> <p>"You're a lucky man," I thought to myself. "There's no way she would let me fuck her like she wanted. But then maybe I could do it without paying for sex, too."</p> <p>I helped her to the bed, then turned her around. I leaned in for a kiss, and the sight of her tongue in my mouth had me hard again.</p> <p>We kissed deeply, our tongues swirling around each other. I couldn't believe how big she was, but we felt so real. My cock started to bob up and down, and we broke off kissing. "I need to go a little slow," I said.</p> <p>"We need to be more careful, Mr. Big. I think I could do with a hand massage now."</p> <p>"Well, you know it's not going to be very deep, you know. I've never had anybody do this before."</p> <p>"I can do it to you, Mr. Big." I couldn't believe how she would be able to just give herself an orgasm with me in between.</p> <p>I walked back to my room and went to change. I had no particular style in that area of our relationship; I just really needed someone to hold onto. I didn't bother with any massage oil, though. I just made the bed, stripped of my clothes, and made myself a sandwich.</p> <p>Natalie came in about an hour later.</p> <p>"Well, did you enjoy that?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Very much," she replied excitedly. "It's just too bad that it won't go on long. Maybe when we get back, I'll let you fuck me again."</p> <p>That sounded good. I decided not to take this all as a come-on, but to just see how she liked it.</p> <p>We set up at her studio and we spent another hour or so with a massage, her favorite way. Our first three hours together, she just laid back against the padded desk, letting me do her back and shoulders. I'm very good at it, and I know how one of the older guys at that hospital does it. She is not a huge fan of massages, and it seemed that she did not like a lot of it. But I really wanted to get some of it done with her.</p> <p>At the end of three, we decided that we had been working for about an hour, and she decided that we were done. "Come back to the motel. I got you some massage oil, for our sex massage. Take your clothes off, and kneel on the bed. I'll get some massage oil, too. I'll put it in your hair. You just relax on the bed, and don't move away from me."</p> <p>I didn't want to be standing up and having her do me like that. I sat down on the bed and got out a bunch of towels. I also had some paper, the ones I use for cleaning things. I took them out and got a bunch in my bag, then got a little one. I went back down the hall. I couldn't find anything else at the motel, thankfully.</p> <p>I walked in a little uncertainly. "It's just for three hours, so I think that's enough for the massage, right?"</p> <p>"No," she smiled, sounding a little disappointed, "that was just for three hours. I have to check in with them again later."</p> <p>She left and I took the towels with me. They smelled good.</p> <p>I put some of the oil on my finger and started rubbing it into the area around her pussy, making sure to massage really good. She really liked that. I started getting into it a little. I could feel her getting really turned on as I stroked over her.</p> <p>"I'm getting aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
