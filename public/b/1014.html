"We're here. How do I put it?"</p> <p>"Just make sure," she answered me. "We're not going anywhere."</p> <p>We turned to leave the alleyway and pulled up on a dirt road leading on a tree, the one that was only two blocks away from the office. The cars parked in the lot were in good repair, I saw from the windows. There was a sign of someone in the back seat of the car with the door open. I looked over my shoulder and saw it was the neighbor. The kid seemed a little hesitant, but decided to do his job and go get him. Before I knew it, the two of them were out the door and running towards their car. We watched them go over to park, then I followed them, going faster to get them out.</p> <p>Once we got inside, I followed with Tina's arm around my shoulder, while I took the lead with my hands, guiding her into the driver's seat. Once they had the seat settled, I turned to kiss her and put my arms around her. She was naked underneath her dress and as we kissed, she started slipping her tongue past my lips and into mine.</p> <p>"Well, looks like fun," she giggled as she kissed me again. "Let's see what kind of fun you've got there."</p> <p>I lifted her dress up, exposing the soft, white panties she was wearing. They were lacy, and so small, that they didn't even cover the little fleshy area of her inner thighs. I had to touch them with the side of my hand, finding that I had to pull the crotch to the side to get at her pussy lips. Then I kissed them, pushing my tongue as deep into her mouth as I could. Her body twitched at the contact, moaning a little.</p> <p>"Oh, that feels good," she said as she pulled her lips away from mine. "It's been months since I've felt that with a guy."</p> <p>"It's still a little rough," I said as I continued to tease her lips with my tongue.</p> <p>"No, not really. I've been with a lot of girls before," she smiled at me now. "But nothing like this, you. I want you. Now." She pulled her panties the rest of the way off and then stepped out of them, stepping right into the middle of the seat. She straddled me and I grabbed her asscheeks with both hands, kneading them gently.</p> <p>"Mmmm, you're ready," she said as she leaned down to kiss me again, running her tongue over mine. "I want to feel your tongue in my pussy tonight. I know it's been a couple months too."</p> <p>She kissed me a few more times, then lowered herself back down, my cock pushing against her pussy lips and into her. I kissed her some more, then pushed my tongue into her mouth, letting it caress her tongue. She held on tight to me as we both came up for air, my dick getting hard a bit more against her pussy as we kissed.</p> <p>"That was great," we said in a whisper. "This is way better than I've ever been."</p> <p>"What?" I said.</p> <p>"Well, I'll tell you later," she said. "And, remember, I'll want to do this again, but not right now. Now turn around...I want to fuck."</p> <p>We kissed again, this time I went straight for her pussy, the taste of her juices still fresh on my tongue as I pressed down against her. She groaned, which made me think she liked it, since just then, I felt the tip of a finger on my left cheek, her finger pressing on my cheek through my hair. And then, she slipped that finger straight in my mouth while her mouth moved right in. I went in to the third knuckle and immediately felt a second finger. After a few sucks for me, she got up to get them out again.</p> <p>"Now, now, don't tell anyone," she laughed. "Or, do you have any idea what you're feeling? I know you're dying to put that cock in me."</p> <p>She pulled off her dress and I saw her pussy in profile as she got into the driver's seat, her legs wide apart so I could see her vagina.</p> <p>"I'm shaved and pretty damn wet, but that might be a little...different."</p> <p>"Let me know if that's what you're afraid of."</p> <p>"How many times did you see that?" she said with a laugh, "I might be going crazy."</p> <p>"Never," I said confidently. "But I can still get into a fight with a girl with very little to no hair. And, if you can get it out of me, then Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
