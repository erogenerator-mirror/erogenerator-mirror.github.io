She smiled.</p> <p>"You are not my father. You know you would not love me. You are too old and too old for me." I whispered.</p> <p>"Dad!" She cried looking up at me.</p> <p>I laughed with her tears running down my cheeks to run down mine, but she stopped them.</p> <p>"Dad! Come downstairs. We need to talk. There is something wrong."</p> <p>I could hear her tears in my chest, but I held on to the anger she always had for me.</p> <p>"Come downstairs girl! Let's talk!"</p> <p>The door was closed and I turned to see two people standing in the kitchen. The two were looking at me and talking.</p> <p>"Why Mom. Why are you here?" They asked in unison, both grinning wickedly.</p> <p>I went off and walked to the front door that led into the back yard, and waited until the two went to the front door, then opened it.</p> <p>"Hello, boys!" I smiled at them both as they entered the kitchen.</p> <p>"What's going on in there?" I smiled as they walked down the stairs to sit down at the kitchen table.</p> <p>"What is going on in there?" They both asked in unison, both smiling broadly.</p> <p>I waited for them to say something; anything else. I didn't bother.</p> <p>"What happens to those two girls that I just talked to? You were at the meeting with them." My dad stood up.</p> <p>"Yes sir, I was with the three of them in my office."</p> <p>"Yes sir we were here." His voice was sharp.</p> <p>"Well, I guess that you know how to handle this. It shouldn't be long." I chuckled to their expressions.</p> <p>"It's not that bad." He laughed and continued to stand, his smile turning to a frown.</p> <p>"What in the world is going on? Why couldn't you tell us what was going on?" I frowned at him.</p> <p>"One of the reasons you don't come here was because we thought you might be an enemy of ours." He pointed a finger at me.</p> <p>"We didn't mean to hurt you, dad. We were just kidding about that."</p> <p>"Of course not." I laughed, then walked over towards them and sat down beside them.</p> <p>After a few seconds, I spoke first.</p> <p>"I need to talk to both of you about something."</p> <p>Both shook their heads and the three sat there looking at me, still looking confused.</p> <p>"Okay, I'll go and wait for them to come downstairs" They all replied, then they stood up to leave.</p> <p>"I'll talk to them later." I said as I stood up to walk out the front door and I turned to see that mom stood next to dad, watching him walk out the front door. He was looking her right in the eyes. I looked away and thought for a minute, then smiled. I couldn't resist the temptation and I walked over to him and got on my knees in front of his chair facing him.</p> <p>"You know, I like your eyes mom." I smiled as I said it.</p> <p>"Thanks... you look familiar." I smirked slightly.</p> <p>"Yeah." He chuckled as he sat down. I walked over to him and leaned down to kiss his cheek.</p> <p>"I like that. I'm glad to be seen with you. I'd like to hang with you again sometime." I giggled and looked up at daddy.</p> <p>He smiled at me and looked back to look at the girls sitting at the table.</p> <p>"They just asked me to stay downstairs while they talked..." I laughed.</p> <p>I put my hands on my hips and glared at daddy.</p> <p>"I should go and talk to them now, though. They are probably wondering what we will decide." I smirked in my own defense.</p> <p>"Well, why don't you take them upstairs so I can talk to you and then we can talk. By the way..." I laughed before I got up to leave then started walking towards the front porch.</p> <p>"Don't you have some papers to write up?" Daddy said, as soon as I heard it.</p> <p>"Yes, Mr. Andrews. I have a copy for you and if you want to tell me something before you do, just put on some clothes." I smiled and then got up to leave.</p> <p>"Mr. Andrews. Oh, thank you thank you." He replied as I got to the door.</p> <p>"So, what you have to do is go out to my office, then wait in my chair and sit downâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
