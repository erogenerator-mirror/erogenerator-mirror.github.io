I had a big headache, I wasn't going to see my mom for at least a day. I was on edge for the next half hour until I heard an approaching car and the driver said, "I had an extra suit on it, please forgive."</p> <p>"A special man that has been given something else to wear, please don't put that much material on, I know it's for the next car."</p> <p>"You're on vacation, but please take off your suit. We'll be there soon, it will only take a couple of minutes."</p> <p>We arrived in the city. There were only two buildings that we visited because the only city was this one. We went the airport and checked in. Most of the people there were in casual clothes but I kept noticing a few people wearing a uniform or shorts. I decided to wear my bathing suit and when the plane started moving I noticed the security personnel with me. I sat on the plane and told them to put that jacket and tie on if possible. I wasn't in uniform so they told me to come out in the jacket and tie.</p> <p>I was nervous and excited and had visions of seeing a big cock and I know I was acting like a silly schoolgirl. I kept thinking to myself, 'It has to be an accident, and it has to be bad! It just has to be an accident!' the thought was so exciting. I went to the bathroom got cleaned up and came back in the cabin. My mom called to let me know what we were getting tickets for. I told her to come right over and that I should make us some coffee and wait for the bags to arrive. I waited in the dark room for three minutes and got tired in that long. I went back into the cabin, packed a cup and sat next to my mom. We sat and I got a cup and started talking.</p> <p>"You are a big girl and I understand you really do come from a parent's home." " I can't get over how you have changed in the last ten years." " My mom's father was a good man, I've always believed there were people before him. But I've seen a different side of you every morning, even more than your mom did. How did you get the courage to come into my life? When did you come into my life that you were like him?" I looked into her eyes and she was smiling at me. " I guess I have this on some kind of special bond with you but until you're older I don't think this would be a problem for us."</p> <p>"I had my heart broken at the age of thirteen, but I have loved you for five years while I waited for my chance to be with another woman. It wasn't hard because I would find out after a while with who was right and who it could be. It wasn't my decision on whom to marry, but I had to do it." We sat in silence for a minute then she looked at me and said. "You didn't have to choose but you knew it was what you wanted." "I'll start going through my closet and see what I find. Then I'll see if I can decide what I want to do. If I am happy with anything I am going to tell my mom." I started crying and told her about my dream.</p> <p>We were sitting there for about an hour and then the plane began to slowly rise. "We are getting closer to our destination. We have a few minutes before our plane leaves." We got off of the plane and the plane came to a stop. My heart was fluttering and my lips trembled when I heard the first voice I knew. it was my mother.</p> <p>"Can I call and see you about anything?" She said. She was nervous like a new mom, but she didn't question me. I didn't. "I just hope I will have something for you. Something you will be proud of." "Mom, I'm not sure what we need or what you will be proud of next week. I hope you get the right man." I walked up and we were kissing then. She knew I was coming on to her by her kiss and smiled at me.</p> <p>"Thanks for coming down, I am so happy my family is with me." I couldn't speak. I know that sounded terrible and wrong and I wanted to tell her to forget it but I was so excited it didn't even faze my mother at all.</p> <p>"Well go on now and kiss. I really got you excited. I have been thinking of that night and it's about time you got it right." The silence between us was eerie and it made me wish I had never given it a second thought. I started to apologize for coming down but Mom didn't let up. I looked at her and I could tell she was crying too.
