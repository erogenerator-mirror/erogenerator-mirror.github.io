I just came back to get to know her. We'll be spending the night."</p> <p>"I still think she has the right answer. She has been here for months with no one else in town and now she doesn't see any new signs of life. I'm not going to let everything become a mystery that doesn't exist. It is just going to have to do."</p> <p>"That's what she wants, isn't it? To find a new man?"</p> <p>"She said so one time. She doesn't want too much, that you won't be all that interested. What she wants is for you to be there. The best part about it is that you can't tell anyone how much you like what you see. She is too old to see that. She still thinks a lot of herself in her mind, even more so if she is really happy. If you don't watch out, it could be too late to keep yourself from trying to put your face in her business."</p> <p>"What if you can't do that?" I countered. "But there are a few options. One is that you can just watch out. The second is to get out. If you do watch out when you start to see the things that you feel you have to see, you will learn something. And just be yourself. You won't be a stranger."</p> <p>"Is that what I'm doing?"</p> <p>"No, but you can't stop yourself from watching. You've got to put on a brave face and say you're going to let someone find you. You have to make this all go away. It's all you have to live for now because there's only one thing to do. Now get to know her."</p> <p>She looked at me for a moment, then turned to the door, and got back to her feet. With a few steps, she turned back towards me and said, "I need you. I am so tired of waiting. This is where the real action starts. Now get back to work."</p> <p>"She wants you," I said, looking at her. "Is that what she told me?"</p> <p>Hesitating, she looked up at him and said, "Yes. She told me. But her words aren't true."</p> <p>"I don't believe it. There is nothing I'm not going to do to help her. When she came to me, she said that I could just stay over, and that it would be more fun if I would just sleep in your bed every night. She didn't seem to want me to come down here, though. She told me that sometimes people sleep in other's rooms and wouldn't care who was watching."</p> <p>I was puzzled, but when he went on, there wasn't any arguing. In fact, I was starting to understand the man. He couldn't be older than 55, although maybe it was closer to 60.</p> <p>"Please, sit down. I haven't been sitting down in ages, either."</p> <p>He came back with a chair and sat down opposite me. It was a nice warm evening. He sat down beside me, and looked out across the landscape of southern California, looking out for the stars.</p> <p>"Would you like something to drink?"</p> <p>"Actually, I'm not sure I'm comfortable drinking all of this in a restaurant. When did you get the idea of that?" He looked at me, and I took a big swallow of my beer before adding, "I feel that I don't want to make you uncomfortable. It seems like a perfectly appropriate response for being here all this time, though."</p> <p>The man looked at me for a moment, then looked back to where we were sitting. "I have some papers for my father, and they're due the morning of next week. I have to get home because of business related matters. Maybe the time will pass before the time comes around again."</p> <p>Before he could answer, I got up and went into the kitchen. I put the paper in front of him, then returned to where I had been sitting.</p> <p>"Thank you for coming out again," I said, smiling at him.</p> <p>"If you do find her appealing, I would be willing to sleep here every night if you'd let me."</p> <p>I smiled at him as I sat down and took out my own sandwich and a couple of cups of tea. "We should get back soon, though. Dad still has an alarm clock up in my room and we have to go to sleep, but I'm going to get some sleep. Are you willing to stay a while if I can stay a while at your place. For me, the only thing that bothers me about this place is that it's far enough away from where I live."</p> <p>"Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
