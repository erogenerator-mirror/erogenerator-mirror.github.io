"Nothing, really. No big point, I'm just too scared to think anything."</p> <p>"You know, before this trip I used to go over where you lived every chance it got," she whispered as we neared the end. "Every summer you came over to my place." She took her finger and trailed it under my chin, tilting my head to look back up to meet her eyes. "One day, the kids were on their way up to visit grandma and grandma's parents. They must have been home. You looked so sad for your grandma," she explained. "A couple of minutes later, we heard the doorbell ring and mom's footsteps. I thought she was getting dressed so we went down."</p> <p>I nodded, then felt her eyes boring into me like knives. "I wasn't planning on bringing my sister back here," she whispered in my ear. I felt tears starting to build up in my eyes. I shook my head and turned towards her once again. "She never gave permission. She didn't even let me go on my own. So I had to walk home alone."</p> <p>"Oh Jesus," I whispered as I felt her fingers hook under my towel and drag it up behind my back. With a quick nudge on my butt, she grabbed my butt cheek, then slid me back into the bedroom. I moaned in response as I felt my cock start to stir.</p> <p>"Why don't you come back into the bedroom?"</p> <p>I shook my head, not wanting to. "But I'm not sure why I'm so nervous."</p> <p>As she pulled me into the bedroom, she turned to the light switch and flipped it on. She pulled the curtain back from the doorway and stared me in the eye. "I'm not sure about that."</p> <p>"Why not?" I asked, unable to stop the tears.</p> <p>"Because I'm going to be alone this weekend," she replied. "Maybe I'll have you for dinner next week." I nodded, taking the opportunity to wipe my eyes and wipe some of the tears away. She reached down and wiped my cheek, then leaned forward to kiss my lips. "That sounds like a lovely way to spend the weekend."</p> <p>All I could do was take her in.</p> <p>"I am glad you agreed to come back to the bedroom," she whispered. I felt her hands slide slowly over my cock, then slide down the outside of my briefs. "I can feel it hardening," she continued, tracing the outline with one finger. "The thought of you cumming in my mouth is just about as sexy as it gets."</p> <p>"I don't know if I can..."</p> <p>"You'll get yours," she agreed. "Just take deep breaths. It'll feel okay, okay?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I can do that," I replied, nodding.</p> <p>She turned and dropped her towel, then leaned back, bringing her legs up on the bed. Looking over her shoulder, she said, "Lay down here," then took hold of the hem of her robe. I moved myself down the bed, settling in between her legs. I slid my fingers upwards slowly until I felt them brush her lips. She let out a sharp breath and closed her eyes. "Like this?" she continued as she spread her lips ever so slightly.</p> <p>I could feel her fingers running through my hair as she rubbed herself. I moved my tongue towards her until it touched the tip of her hard clit, then licked it gently. "Oh God!" she said as she raised her hips to meet me.</p> <p>The sounds coming from her mouth were beautiful. I slid a finger into her wetness before pushing it into her slowly. She was wet tight, and I could feel the muscles of her pussy ripple through her.</p> <p>"Oh, Jesus," I murmured. "I guess you are liking this."</p> <p>She didn't say a word. She just kept going at a fast, even pace.</p> <p>"How is it?" I asked as I watched her nipples harden. "What have you been thinking? Don't worry about it, I just want to put our hands wherever we want." She smiled and bit her lower lip.</p> <p>Moving my hands to her breasts, I rolled her nipples between my fingers, causing them to jiggle. "They're so hard," I whispered before returning to her clit.</p> <p>"You've got them hard? They're all stiff. I wouldn't want to hurt you."</p> <p>I looked up into her eyes as she closed them. "I don't think you can either." I added. "No, I can get used to this."</p> <p>I heard a gasp when she finally spoke again. "Maybe we should just do it."</p> <p>My fingers were slowly moving under her, then started moving inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
