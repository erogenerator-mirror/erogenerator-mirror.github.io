Her pussy was shaved bare. All the men in the pubes and other pubic hair had gone bald, but that was the only evidence other than a slightly moist pink pussy.</p> <p>I felt bad as if everything was a bad dream. I could just imagine her sitting here with her friends in the pub. Even if I didn't happen to be with her friends, who knows what her friends would say? Would they find out if she was with a stranger, but they would be horrified?</p> <p>I was so fucking pissed! It was so unfair.</p> <p>"Lies," I said, "I don't have much experience with a relationship anyway. Don't start with me, I want to know what it is like with your mother, I want to try to make your life so much better."</p> <p>"What happened to your mother," she said, "What happened when she stopped smoking?"</p> <p>"Well, she was working," I said. "She didn't like it when I touched her, and I let her have it, so she became a nun, but she was doing drugs and was a horrible mess, so I had to use the same money to pay for her hospital."</p> <p>"How did she stop smoking then?"</p> <p>"She never stopped doing it."</p> <p>"No," she said quietly, "she was like a kid then. She got so depressed, she couldn't stand it, so now she only has one cigarette."</p> <p>"I don't want to talk about that. Don't you ever call me that?"</p> <p>She shook her head. "Only that. You never know," she lied.</p> <p>"But it's hard to do what I want without doing it with you."</p> <p>She reached out and wrapped her finger around mine as she spoke.</p> <p>"But you have to be a virgin, so you have to give them to your lover to pass on that knowledge to you. Besides, they would be good memories anyway."</p> <p>I was shocked. She couldn't be talking to me like this, but what was I to do. I didn't want to let her do this to me. I didn't want to have to watch her face. For all the other stuff she has been doing with me, nothing like this ever happened. She had to be smart about it.</p> <p>"What happened to your father?" I asked.</p> <p>"He passed away in my mom's car about a month after she died. I guess you understand that, right? My mom would kill me if I brought the kids back. Anyway, the way I have been for years, she left me a lot money. I didn't have the power to make it that far, but she did, so I couldn't take a job so much. She was going to take me to her friends and I could hardly move for the next twenty years."</p> <p>"That's very nice," I said. "I'll give you something to think about. You don't have to tell."</p> <p>"Nope," she said. "It was my dad's idea. We didn't know what we were going to do if we took him out."</p> <p>I couldn't believe it, so she went on. "You never knew when mom would tell her if her husband went off with someone else. I couldn't wait to know. Now that I know that my father's going to die, I feel better. I mean, I wasn't in school when I started smoking, right? He should have been doing it right. He must have really liked it when you were in town and it didn't feel as if I was a bad teacher any more. I mean, at least if he did, I wouldn't have to let him smoke in her house and he could have someone else do it for free."</p> <p>She stopped talking but I heard her breathing in and out faster. "It's the same for me now. I didn't realize that my mom would be living with your dad until she brought her home after I had smoked the pot in her living room. I figured she'd want me to wait until I'm old enough to do that again," she said. "For her, it was just an initiation. She wanted me to give this back to you. When you're a doctor or something, I'll do it."</p> <p>She took a breath and looked at me. "It's not like you can just sit here looking at me all day. Can we just talk about this for a bit?" she said.</p> <p>Before I could even respond, the phone rang. I answered it.</p> <p>"This is my Aunt Patrizea's cell phone number, remember?" I said, and then hung up. I looked at her for a minute and then looked at herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
