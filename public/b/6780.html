"Yeah, it's a promise."</p> <p>"Hey, that's all this was for," he said and pulled the plug from my ass.</p> <p>"Mmm, you did good!" I said.</p> <p>"It wasn't so bad when you came, but you know what I meant by 'good'."</p> <p>"Okay." I said as I turned around, grabbed hold of the anal probe and ran the tip just inside my pussy lips before lowering it again.</p> <p>"No, let me," I said, knowing from my own experience, that the probe would do the trick. But only one place. I leaned forward on my elbows and pulled my legs up to hold them there while pushing back against the probe. It went in easily, and as its ridged edge went in I held the base while pushing back, and it went in deeper with a second inch of hard plastic. My pussy contracted even tighter around the probe as it squeezed inside me, and all I could think about is the moment before the second inch disappeared into my body. "God that feels so good," I said as I rocked against the probe.</p> <p>"Yes. You did well. You're going to go all the way home, in two minutes."</p> <p>"Yeah, that was awesome," I said.</p> <p>"Me, too," he said grinning at me.</p> <p>"I thought you said you would let me fuck you in the ass," I teased.</p> <p>"Yeah. It did feel good."</p> <p>"Really, so you do enjoy it?"</p> <p>"Yeah," he said, and it was then that I realized he was getting hard. I looked over at him and saw the bulge in his pants and immediately felt self conscious about it. Just as I was thinking about how my body was reacting to my own reactions to his touch, he walked over and sat down next me.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm so sorry," I said, and he smiled at the memory of seeing how my body reacts to his touch.</p> <p>"No it's all right, it's just that I couldn't help myself. You look absolutely beautiful right now," he told me.</p> <p>"Wow, your legs look good from here too."</p> <p>"Yeah, but you didn't. That's just me, getting you off."</p> <p>"It's okay," I told him as I looked away, still trying to hide the bulge in his pants.</p> <p>"Yeah, but if I didn't like it, I could be a real dick for you."</p> <p>He laughed. "Just being you gets me that way."</p> <p>"Well, I couldn't help myself, either. Now don't you think there's something I would've done," I said as I looked away again.</p> <p>"We're not making love, just being honest and sharing the joys of my sexual experiences with you," he pointed out.</p> <p>"I hope that's okay," I said with a smile.</p> <p>"It's more than okay as far as I'm concerned." he said with a wink.</p> <p>"You want me just to put down the buttplug and get to it?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'm sure you'll enjoy having it in there," he told me as he raised his eyebrow.</p> <p>"Yeah, maybe too much right now," I said.</p> <p>"I don't think its really a safe time to put the buttplug in," he added, "unless you're having orgasms right now."</p> <p>"Oh right."</p> <p>"Is that what I'm supposed to do then?"</p> <p>"Why don't you do it, and you can see what else I have in mind," he answered, standing up and walking toward a desk and pulling out a pen and a piece of paper.</p> <p>He walked over to the desk and pulled two lines of paper out. "You can put this one next together and we can start over," he said with a grin.</p> <p>I looked at the paper. "Okay. We'll see how I do. Here, I want you to write down your experience and give it to me as a gift. I will write you the name of the woman you enjoy this as well." I handed him the paper and he grinned. I smiled, leaned back on my elbows again, and read over the letter.</p> <p>"Hovering around in the neighborhood for your birthday was awesome," I wrote while staring at the paper.</p> <p>"Yes. I loved it. I can't believe you did that for me as your present," he said with a grin.</p> <p>"Yeah, me too, and it was so special to say it. I can't think of a more appropriate present ever since I bought it from you." I told him.</p> <p>"I'm glad you enjoyed itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
