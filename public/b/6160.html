He chuckled, leaning forward to give her a good-natured smack on her bare ass. She grinned back, giving him plenty of smack in return.</p> <p>"You're going to take a good shower to make sure," she teased. He slapped her ass again.</p> <p>"No, wait. Where is this coming from?"</p> <p>"I was trying to figure out that you really are in need of some exercise and being this early in the morning has ruined much of your energy; so just go to the bathroom. I'll see if I can find something for you to do around here before you leave with the door open." She gave him another smacking smack in the side and gave him a smile; and he gave it back with more than a handshake.</p> <p>He walked out, not even bothering to try and open the door. The door slammed behind him, and he was left standing outside the bathroom. Only then did he notice that there was a note on the counter in front of him; telling him to take off his clothes and lie down on the bed. He did as he was told and was surprised to find that the note he had read was a copy of his wife's instructions on what she had planned for him to do for that day. There was a note attached as well, telling him to make sure that he had gotten everything he needed; it was something to ensure that there was no possibility of him missing seeing it. He did exactly as he was told and laid on his back, breathing heavily and thinking of his wife and how everything had just come to this. It had all finally turned upside down, and he just felt a great sadness.</p> <p>When she returned, she handed him a glass of water and offered it to him. Once he had swallowed the cold water, he got in his bed and placed his forehead on the pillow. The next morning he heard the shower start and he wondered if he could still feel his sleep. He didn't wake until dawn, and when he did he wondered if he would have to go to work by 7. He did manage to sneak out of bed and walk into the bathroom where he stripped off his clothes, and then entered the shower.</p> <p>He was surprised to find that the water didn't really bother him; when she came out of the shower, he thought she would continue to be at her full potential. As it turned out, however, he was surprised to find out she got off at almost exactly the same time as he did. And then one thing led to another, and they began to make love. Neither of them was in a hurry to be quick about it, but they just loved the feel of each other's bodies.</p> <p>When they were done, she told him she would be right back with something to eat to keep her strength up. When she reappeared, he got out of bed, stripped off his dirty clothes, and looked for a robe which he was going to throw to the floor. He ran back to the bedroom to find her laying out some very plush towels, a bottle of body wash to go with it. He also brought off some of the towels to rub into his back, and then got a small towel to dry off his feet and face.</p> <p>She took his robe off, and then began to dry his chest and back. She took his head and shampooed it very quickly, starting at his ear and moving down to his neck. When she reached his shoulder, she started to gently massage his neck and chest, running her fingers over his chest. She worked her way down to his waist, and then back up the other side at the same time. She took his hard cock in hand and stroked him a few times, taking extra care not to let any of his semen slide out, until he took the hint.</p> <p>She gently put his now-clean cock in her mouth and suckled it for a few moments, then put his feet up on the edge of the bed, then stood in front of him. He watched, as she rubbed his chest with her hands, making sure she didn't get any suds on them. She ran her hands over his chest, and then down his stomach. When she had worked her way down there, she took his cock in her hand and ran her fingers down the side of it. When she got to his balls, she used both hands to massage them, taking both of them into her mouth at once, sucking them and letting his cock slide in and out of her mouth. When she had reached all of it, she looked up at him to see that he had his head back on the bed. She leaned closer to him, taking his cock straight into her mouth, and took it as deep as she could, her hands going under and over his balls as well, squeezing them as she ranâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
