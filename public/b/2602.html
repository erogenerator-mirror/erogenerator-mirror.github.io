I'll call you later this evening."</p> <p>"I'd better leave you alone," said Mr. Wilson. "If you want to leave your apartment, you'll need to wait outside for me."</p> <p>Beth heard the sound of the phone being picked up and she felt him place the receiver back on the cradle.</p> <p>She turned and saw that Brad was standing in the doorway, holding the cell phone out. He handed her the phone and she took it and held it out to him.</p> <p>"That was you," he said. "You're really important. I'm so happy for you."</p> <p>"This is all right," she said, taking Brad's hands. "There's nothing better. I'm really glad you're coming with me as well."</p> <p>"Where are we going?" he asked.</p> <p>"You'll see. It's a nice house."</p> <p>"It's beautiful. It's so pretty. It's really nice to live in such a lovely place."</p> <p>Beth laughed again. "I know. It's really nice."</p> <p>"It's nice. I like it. It's really nice."</p> <p>"You might just like it too."</p> <p>She nodded. "Yes, I definitely do. Thank you."</p> <p>"You're welcome."</p> <p>Beth closed the door and walked down the hall to where she had parked her car. It was a two bedroom house- it had to be built around, she thought, I mean, Brad's parents would not allow their son to live in here, would they? But the way he'd reacted to her, the look he'd shown her this evening, it couldn't have anything to do with him.</p> <p>Beth pulled into the driveway of the family home and parked her car. She turned the key in the garage door opener and entered the house. As she reached the living room and opened the door, Brad stood there.</p> <p>"It's nice to see you," he said.</p> <p>"Oh, it's always nice to see you."</p> <p>'What about me?"</p> <p>"Oh, yeah."</p> <p>He reached out and stroked her face.</p> <p>"Can I see you some other time?" she asked, not really wanting to take the time to say goodbye.</p> <p>He didn't say anything.</p> <p>Beth turned and walked into the house.</p> <p>As she walked into the living room, she turned back to Brad.</p> <p>"Do you mind if I give you a tour?"</p> <p>At Brad's nod, she took his hand and led him upstairs to the bedroom. The bedroom was huge, but it was still fairly small. It had two queen-sized beds, a dresser and a big screen television beside a large sliding door that looked out on the front yard. The top of the large bedroom had a white mattress on the floor and a couple of pillows were stacked on the nightstand as well as a vanity. The bed was much larger than the rest of the house at the moment, giving it a full length room and it had a single bed frame and a headboard. It was the sort of bed you would see in a movie theater, though; it was not your everyday bed.</p> <p>Beth got onto the bed and pulled off her dress. As she started undressing, she looked at Brad expectantly. He was staring at her as she removed the dress. She smiled to herself as she saw his expression. After undressing, she got up on the bed and climbed on top of him. It was as if they had been doing it all their lives. Bending over, she brought her body between his legs and reached for the headboard.</p> <p>"Beth, I don't want this to be awkward or anything," she said.</p> <p>"It's fine," he said. "It's nice to see some other people again," he added.</p> <p>She paused. "I don't care what's happening between us - you know what I mean."</p> <p>Beth lowered her head next to his and began to kiss him. It didn't take long for the both of them to become lost in the kiss and it didn't last. The kiss became more passionate and they began to writhe against each others bodies as they continued to kiss.</p> <p>Brad ran his hands down her back and over her ass- she felt his erection pressing against her.</p> <p>"Your body feels great," she said.</p> <p>"Yeah," he said. "I like it that's all."</p> <p>"My body feels great. I like it that you like it that you like itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
