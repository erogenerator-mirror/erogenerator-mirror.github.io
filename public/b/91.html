I loved having him fuck me hard and long. It took all I had in me to resist my orgasm and cum on his cock. I wanted to feel his mouth on me again as I came on his cock and I didn't want it to end.</p> <p>I was so aroused, my pussy was wet and warm, and my body ached. I was on the verge of cumming from his hard strokes, but I thought, hey, he's hard again!</p> <p>Before I thought it over, I felt some movement on the wall. Then he moved me back into a position so he could lay my down. He took his cock in his hand once, and rubbed the head back and forth. Then he took it in his hand and put it in-head-first.</p> <p>He began fucking my pussy again slowly. I felt I might be on the edge again and I wanted him to fuck me as deep as he could. I reached out and slid my hand over his crotch to massage his cock. When I could feel it pulsating and hardening, I pulled his cock back. It seemed like forever and I wondered if I would get the urge again. He moved me gently off of the bench and I got on all fours. He moved in behind me and rubbed his cock over my pussy. He slowly began fucking my pussy with his cock. It was wet and felt great. He began moving in and out slowly and I was in paradise. I closed my eyes as he fucked me. I moaned and moaned; I knew I would cum again if he did that to me.</p> <p>He started really fucking me faster and harder. I moaned and groaned and screamed with pleasure. He knew it would not be long till I would cum again. I began to shudder and shake as I came.</p> <p>I moaned, "Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh-oh-oh!"</p> <p>When I opened my eyes, I was staring at the clock and seeing time. It was ten twenty five. My heart began beating twice as fast as it had and I saw that he had already pumped a full load of cum in me. He collapsed on me and I embraced with him. We lay there together while we both drifted back to sleep. I wanted to stay and watch him but I didn't think I could sleep. When I opened my eyes again I saw that we had finished fucking and I saw his cum oozing out of me. I began licking it off of him and I could feel the heat of our orgasms flowing through us. I couldn't believe it. This had been the hottest fuck I'd ever had. When I came back to myself from my daydream a little bit, I felt his cock start to move again and I heard him growl. "I'm gonna cum!"</p> <p>"Yes!" I moaned, "Cum for me." I knew this would put me over the top. I felt me cumming again while my husband kept fucking me. It felt as if his cock was growing a little longer and bigger inside of my pussy. I felt myself shaking as my orgasm overtook me. I felt his cock begin to harden inside of me again. I felt his cock throbbing and pulsing as it shot his cum up and deep into my pussy that I could get no relief. I didn't bother to try to get him to stop fucking me, I had just let him finish filling me with his sperm. It only took a few moments or so before he was done. He fell on me as I wrapped my arms and legs around him, he looked at me and smiled as he looked at what I was doing. We laid there for a while, his arm around me, me on each side of him. He kissed me on the nose and then I let him pull himself up and turn off the light. He took my hand and held it as he moved it to his cock and kissed my fingers.</p> <p>"I thought I said no orgasms!" I said smiling.</p> <p>"You just wanted to watch me do it! It was great! I didn't mind."</p> <p>"That's it," I replied, moving my fingers through his hair. "You just gave me the hottest orgasm I've ever had in a very long time. You are so beautiful, and have the greatest body. You're still hard after we started it!"</p> <p>I could feel his cock responding to me saying the things I said. He didn't respond verbally except for moans.</p> <p>"Would you like me as your husband?" I asked after a while.</p> <p>"You'll call me husband, honey." He replied.</p> <p>"You don't have to answer that. But I need to tell you what you will do forâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
