I didn't say anything, just closed the door. I didn't need to be at least semi-conscious about what I was wearing. In fact, if we hadn't been at the club, I might have been surprised myself the way you were sitting. You had on a pair of black slacks and white shirt with a thin leather belt, the kind that is open to the top but hangs loosely. We had a good eye lock on each other, although you were doing a sort of half-witted stuttering, like you didn't know what to say.</p> <p>"I need to thank you for letting me stay here tonight," I said.</p> <p>"No! I told you I'm not interested. You are just being a sweetie while I showered, it's been a little over a week!" I told you.</p> <p>To my total shock, you just stood there, arms at your sides, looking at me, waiting to see how I would respond, or even whether you were a little angry with me for saying this, or if you might've liked it if I could have made you take off your shirt and get the hell out of there before I started getting a little carried away. You said nothing, just stared at me. I didn't know whether it might be because you were afraid to say anything to me, or whether it was because you were being so friendly, but I decided to take no chances.</p> <p>"So...," I said. "So, uh, I'm interested in some business, and if you will accept my offer...you can come if you like." I looked up at you as I said this, but you just smiled and nodded, then closed the door. I stood in the entrance hall, completely naked, as the door closed behind me, and I looked at you, completely in your face, waiting for you to say something. You just sat there, a slightly confused look on your face, and then you leaned over and gave me a kiss on the cheek.</p> <p>"It's a date!" you said, "I really can't disappoint you anymore."</p> <p>I laughed, then said, "Oh, right. Sorry. I know what you're suggesting, but I'm not interested in you going out with just anyone. I'll stay and keep that in mind, but if I decide to have you, I'll go to your house for the night, if that's alright with you. Deal?"</p> <p>"Deal!" you said, smiling, then put your hands out like you were going to hold me up.</p> <p>"Alright" I said, not really caring anymore. I just accepted the terms.</p> <p>"But, maybe... " you began.</p> <p>I looked back at you. "What?"</p> <p>"I'm not interested in anything tonight."</p> <p>I looked back at you again. "You really are interested, aren't you?"</p> <p>"Yes!" you replied, almost instantly. I was looking into your eyes, and it was clear from the expression on your face that you were thinking the same thing.</p> <p>"Yes," I answered for you, again, "I...I know. But I still think that it's the best thing that's ever happened, and I don't want to screw it up. I've found that it isn't cheating, whether or not I think it is."</p> <p>I was not ready to push that line of conversation, so I sat back down and said, "It wasn't cheating, either, but I think it was, uh...different. I don't know, maybe only with two girls, but I think it's better if you guys stop pretending that it isn't. We should at least make an effort to make it easier, too. You and I...we are friends."</p> <p>Your face was turning red, but you didn't let go of my arm. "If that's the case, we're not even that close" you said, "I'm not sure I want this to end up in some kind of a fight."</p> <p>I still sat there, smiling, enjoying the atmosphere, looking back at you. "I still am interested," you said, in that same low sensuous voice. "Yes, I'm interested in having our first threesome happen."</p> <p>I wasn't really thinking about the possibility of being too involved with another girl, but the words were still coming out of my mouth as if they were in fact intended.</p> <p>As if reading my mind, you said, "Let's go!"</p> <p>The moment we walked through the door, there were going to be a lot of wild, frenzied, crazy, crazy fun that night. I had a pretty good idea what would happen, butâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
