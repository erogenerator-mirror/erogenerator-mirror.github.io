I can fuck you till you're cumming, all night," his body started to tremble and then his breathing became labored and he groaned.</p> <p>"It will be my pleasure," she moaned at him as she laid back on the bed, she wanted to feel his body on hers as he kissed her again and then began a fast work into her, moving with his own needs, his body and mind.</p> <p>She was close to the edge, she could feel her muscles tighten up, and let out a loud scream that she didn't know she'd made, and it only urged him on and he increased to the point of no return, and she let her body go completely with one massive effort and her knees buckled.</p> <p>She looked down as his arms fell away and he was laying on top of her with his body pressing her into the bed.</p> <p>"Oh, my G," she moaned as he filled her once again and then started to slowly slide out with each of his thrusts. His cock was a slick and velvety mass as his tip slid across her skin each time as if it were the softest and most comfortable toy she had ever had.</p> <p>The whole time she didn't know what had just happened, but as he made love to her, feeling and tasting her, she knew. As soon as he came inside of her, she felt as close to heaven as she had ever felt in her entire life and he was kissing her so fast. She was breathless and so very happy as he came, he had to have felt that way and the moment his load began exploding into the deepest part of her body, it was as if she'd been made to take it.</p> <p>They laid together, she still on his huge pillow, covered with the sheets that they had thrown into the air. Finally she rolled over on her side with her head on his chest as he ran his hand up the smooth, smooth skin and up her spine.</p> <p>"I can imagine feeling completely fulfilled," he replied to her with a smile.</p> <p>"I can't describe how that is what being with you is like, I can't get the feeling, that being with you makes me feel so, so close to you. Your body is so sweet to me."</p> <p>"I love that you are inside of me, you feel soooo good. Your cock is so close to my pussy."</p> <p>"Yes, your pussy is very warm and wet, it is a wonderful feeling for me and I love making us feel that way."</p> <p>He moved and lifted her up as her head rested on his shoulder and he kissed up her neck to her lips.</p> <p>"Honey, if you wanted you could have taken that thing and now get dressed. You can still make love to me tonight."</p> <p>"Will you come back here every time you're here, it would so be so, you know."</p> <p>"Baby, you are so beautiful, and I can't get the feeling that I've been missing out on so much. But, baby, there are other people out there that would want to have you, maybe with me being there."</p> <p>He rolled over and took her face in his hands and kissed her lips and then his tongue was in her mouth, exploring and probing, his lips on hers, and his lips on hers. Then he moved down over her breasts and down her stomach, stopping to give them a kiss on each thigh, until he kissed her stomach before his mouth made its way past the elastic of her underwear and he could smell her woman musk as his tongue slithered against her.</p> <p>She was moaning and writhing under him with each lick of his tongue.</p> <p>"You know that's what you have to offer my sweet baby," he said to her as he got off the bed and sat on her bed to get them both more comfy as long as he did what he wanted with her.</p> <p>She giggled as he knelt on the floor by her hips. Her legs were on either side of his as he looked up for a moment before moving on. He kissed her softly and then moved her so that his body was aligned with hers to feel and tease. Then he positioned himself between her legs, kissing her inner thighs and moving further down until she felt his tongue start making its way towards her pussy.</p> <p>He gently placed his hand on her leg as he licked from her thighs to just inside her pussy. "Honey, are you sure this is where you want all of me? I can't seem to feel rightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
