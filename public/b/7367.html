So I said nothing. She looked at me and asked me if I was alright. I told her with her looking at me that I wasn't and how I was so nervous but felt so loved.</p> <p>"It's ok," she said, "I liked what happened to you too and you didn't seem to mind."</p> <p>I felt really bad about thinking like that, but said nothing, figuring everything would be alright.</p> <p>She had me turn around and she told me to face away from her so that she could inspect my bottom and my sex. She asked me again if I was okay with what I had done and I still had feelings for her. I felt embarrassed. I started to get more nervous. She said that was fine, we both understood that. Then she put some spittle in my bottom and started touching me and I thought I would faint. She told me to stay there while she did it and I stayed. Finally, she said she wanted me to feel wanted and safe as she went around and touched me.</p> <p>I felt like it turned me on again hearing her talk like that in front of me, but she wanted me to stay.</p> <p>Finally, she stopped and asked me to get on all fours and go down into the bathtub. She knelt down in front of me and started to apply the lotion to my bottom. I sat on the toilet seat and she told me to take off my swim-suit so I could keep it from getting wet, "Do you understand what we are doing?"</p> <p>I told her I did and looked down at my hands nervously and then she put some more lotion and I got all tense.</p> <p>"Okay," she said. "I'm going to put a finger in your bottom while I apply your lotion and I can feel how relaxed you are. I'm going to then massage you so that you don't feel like you need anything." She told me to turn to the side so she could have a good view.</p> <p>I turned to face the edge of the tub and she started to rub oil into my bottom. It felt so good. I felt more relaxed as she got to massaged my bottom. She went up slowly and ran her hands up and down my bottom a little, all the while looking at me with the same intensity. She told me not to get too excited because she wanted to get me warmed up before going any further.</p> <p>When I was really uncomfortable she put a finger in and I felt even better, but again not as powerful as when she rubbed me there. I told her I wasn't excited and she said that was all right. She got up out of bed and took off her bathing suit. She told me to get in the tub and she would oil me up a little more and rub a little more until I was ready. I sat there with my bottom on the edge and just looked at her like she had told me not to get nervous.</p> <p>When I was ready I stood up slowly and she got a good look at my pussy. I think I was as excited as she was. She said, "Are you sure you are ready?"</p> <p>I said, "Yes, I am, I want this." I looked over my shoulder at her and she said, "Good. So this is what you want."</p> <p>And I knew what she was talking about, even though I wanted everything she had said. I didn't have any problem with that but when she said that I took a minute to think about it and then said that I'm ready. She got down in front of me and got the lotion and squirted it onto my hands. She took me by the shoulders and massaged my hands down along my arms and I felt like she was touching me all over. She squirted more lotion and started to apply it to my front. She asked me to go ahead with my first time fingering my bottom and I said that was a good idea.</p> <p>She told me to slide one finger between my legs while the other one was pushing in a little. I did my exercises regularly. She said, "Ok. Now it's time to give you your first experience in bed and to feel you orgasm. Let's try it out for both of you."</p> <p>I followed her instructions very slowly and it felt so great to lie across the bed with her finger in my bottom. I spread my legs a little so she could get a good good view of my sex and she rubbed lotion between my legs a lot.</p> <p>After my first orgasm, I thought about what was going on and decided that I liked it and was a little excited at the idea of letting others watch me like this.</p> <p>She asked me to get on all four and then lay down on myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
