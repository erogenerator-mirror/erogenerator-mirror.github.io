And he's staring at me like he thinks I'm going to say something."</p> <p>I can feel my anger rising.</p> <p>"Dude, I got you all fired!" She shouts. Then she says the most important thing in the world, "This is my fault. I'm going to be very busy for a lot of months! Please don't look for me!"</p> <p>I'm really going to be busy, because I think to myself, "Look, what? I'm not going to work for you!" My mind and body are saying something different, so I decide that I want to tell her the truth. I take a deep breath and let it out slowly.</p> <p>I don't say anything because I know what I need to do in order to survive. I ask for his permission to have them make it back from the bar. She is sitting next to me. She looks really uncomfortable and her face is flushed and bloodshot. I'm hoping he's not going to show up. My heart is pounding and my stomach is still churning.</p> <p>"Dude, get up! Why don't you show me what a nice woman I've made at work? Get in the car now!"</p> <p>He laughs.</p> <p>"But man, I want to see it."</p> <p>She's getting up then and I start the car. As I pull over the shoulder, she's already backing out of her spot in the back and going to come back.</p> <p>"Wait a minute!"</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>He starts his car and we drive back to work. My stomach is starting to turn again. I can't believe this is all happening.</p> <p>This is my first day back. Maybe I'll stay long enough for my boss to see me.</p> <p>"What's up, Mike? Is it your night off?"</p> <p>"Sure," he says. "I'm staying right here."</p> <p>I start the car and park the car and drive back to the place next to where I told him I wanted to get up and start my shift. He says that I'm not going to have a drink in, so he'll have to follow me.</p> <p>"I'm getting up," I tell him. "Get some juice, then come eat my lunch. I'm starving."</p> <p>He grabs his stuff, as I take mine and start my way to my place. I'm not in the mood to bother him, but my stomach really is turning again. I feel really awkward, and I guess that I'm feeling sick. As I'm walking to my place I can feel the cold air in the air, as I open the door.</p> <p>The place is huge and there's lots of furniture everywhere. It's a mess with lots of old stuff thrown on the floor and the chairs and tables are torn out.</p> <p>As I'm walking toward my apartment he stops beside me and asks if I would like me a beer. I tell him that I will do that, since it's my first day back. I sit on the couch. There are pictures, old movies and old books in the little armchair and on the floor of the kitchen.</p> <p>"Here," I say and take a drink of my beer.</p> <p>"What are you drinking?" He asks as I turn toward the coffee machine.</p> <p>"Joke?" I ask.</p> <p>He's looking at the cans of coffee I'm carrying.</p> <p>"Can I have one?"</p> <p>He says, "Sure."</p> <p>He finishes the beer, then picks up his own cup and takes it toward me.</p> <p>"Thanks for your help. I would have stopped you."</p> <p>I lean over and give him a quick kiss.</p> <p>"Why thank you very much!" I say laughing. "Do you want me to show you what a beautiful woman like yourself really is?"</p> <p>He doesn't take any shit and walks toward me. I'm walking slowly toward him. I'm a little nervous. I'm not exactly sure where this is going. His eyes follow my body over the shirt I'm wearing. I can feel his eyes roving up and down me. I'm not sure yet whether I'm turning into a little girl.</p> <p>Finally I get close to him and he reaches up and gently touches my face.</p> <p>"Thank you."</p> <p>He's so soft and so sweet. I'm not sure if I'm falling all over myself, because I feel like I'm falling for him right now. I don't know what's happening or how far this is going to go. But I feel a connection between us. I'm not sure if I'm being set up or not.
