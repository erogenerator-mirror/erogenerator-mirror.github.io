He wanted her, as he watched her tits bounce around as her body was bent so far. His cock was now completely buried inside Lisa. His balls were slapping against her cunt. He felt Lisa's lips wrapping around his cock. Her pussy was tighter than a vice, and he knew she wouldn't be able to take much more tonight. He loved it when he had the power. He lifted Lisa off Chris' cock and turned her around so they couldn't see Lisa's back end from their position. She looked even more stunning against the night sky. He had never witnessed such a perfect vision... "Come on, fuck me, Chris!" she demanded. There was no way he was going to be let off this fast. She still wanted to cum and he'd made sure of that by fucking her like it was some contest. He slowly pulled Lisa's tight ass apart so he could stick his tongue in to lick her sweet juices off. All it took was an inch. Every second turned into eternity and he knew with one big thrust Lisa was going to lose it. Lisa let out a loud cry as he entered her. "Oh yes, you bastard...!" She moaned. Chris moved quickly to bury his cock inside her. She loved being filled so completely, but now she needed some more. He slowly fucked himself into her. He felt himself swelling. He began to pump harder. He wanted to make her cum. He needed to cum so badly. He knew this would end soon. He felt his balls rise as much as his cock would when he pushed himself hard. Lisa moaned at the feeling of her full pussy being taken. It sent him over the edge. He grabbed a hold of her hips and increased his pace. His cock began to explode with cum. He looked over at his wife, who was sitting there watching him as he came, her eyes fixated on his cock as it continued to jerk to a finish inside his slut wife. "My baby, what a wonderful wife you had... Oh yes, you two love each other so much, do you know what you two love is? I always said I loved that. Your wife had a special place for herself in my heart. For the longest time I've kept this secret from her." Chris reached his own orgasm. He fell over backwards as he felt the warmth and strength of all this. He knew it was the hottest he had ever felt, as well as the greatest for her. He pulled Lisa onto him and they kissed and held each other. "It was never going to end." He panted. "Thank you, my dear wife."</p> <p>He kissed his wife again and they got her to go into the bathroom. They could still hear her moans, the slapping of their bodies as their mouths were locked together. She looked back at Chris as he lay next to them. He smiled at her and she told him so. "Yes, I know, it's just the right combination..." They kissed and fell asleep together.</p> <p>The Endâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
