You know that. After that first session with you, there's nothing left to hold me back. I want you bad and you'll have sex with me tomorrow."</p> <p>There it was. I knew this was coming. I was so ready for it.</p> <p>"And you're so good to me," I said. "I want those memories to stay with me forever. I want to live in your world. You don't have to hide from me, you don't have to live without me. You don't have to be with me. I don't have to hide from the world and everything." Then I kissed her. Deep and wet and long and full of passionate desire.</p> <p>We parted after a few minutes but both still on a heightened level of desire. I know that it was going to be worth the wait, although I still didn't think that this time was going to end this way.</p> <p>"If you'd have given me ten minutes, I'd have taken you back. That wouldn't have killed us."</p> <p>"I'm glad you did, because I want more often and better."</p> <p>We fucked each night. It had been a pretty big change. We didn't even speak about a future. I did tell her more about my life and her new job, but our "new relationship" was just part of the job. She could tell that I was on birth control.</p> <p>My job wasn't new to her, but it wasn't the same either. All I really knew was that I loved fucking with her and I was content at the end. It would always be this way.</p> <p>The days that followed felt like years. Her sex life was a revelation. Sometimes I didn't even understand it. Not like I had imagined it would be until then. It had never felt so fulfilling or normal again. Even more so in the future. It felt like a dream.</p> <p>As I thought about it, it was more than a dream. It was like the real thing. There were no worries from any decision, or even any idea of any future, about anything, other than the incredible sex that I was anticipating. I loved it, and I loved her deeply. She loved it. She had wanted it to happen, and I had come to the conclusion that she had wanted it as much as I did.</p> <p>I didn't think it would ever end, so what the hell. That's what I was making it through. She had given herself to me just as I had told her she should. This time was going to be the end of it.</p> <p>+++++++++++++++++++</p> <p>"Oh my God!"</p> <p>I don't know what came over me.</p> <p>I'm sure it was the sound that came from her mouth because I felt the vibration of it.</p> <p>I'm no virgin. I've always been sexually active. I've always been pretty much all right. I've had a couple of small-litty conquests, and we've been married over twenty years. It has always been a satisfying and frequent event, although the sex I had with her was limited. Now it was all for nothing. I couldn't believe that I was in this situation.</p> <p>"I'm ready now, baby," I told her. "I want you to come inside me again."</p> <p>"You know it, sweetie," she said with a smile. Her smile grew. "I'm all yours."</p> <p>She got on the bed and lay her head on my chest and she held her right leg up and placed her left one over my hip and I lifted my hips and I entered her again.</p> <p>It wasn't a long stroke. Just the way she liked it. Just the way she wanted it. It was all about that, it was her sexual excitement and her desires for me. It was all about her. I never heard a man's orgasm like that, and I don't know if it had ever been in another man. Even though she had never made me climax with her mouth before, this time I did. It wasn't as good as it had been with her last time, but it was better and I liked it.</p> <p>She kissed the side of my face, but then she was kissing the sides of my face, her tongue gently laving the parts of my face that never had been there before.</p> <p>My breathing came fast. Her mouth tasted wonderful. I loved seeing her body from this angle and seeing her full breasts pushing out and up as she moved her hips with each of my thrusts.</p> <p>She got comfortable under me and her breasts swung around as I worked my hips against her. It was so exciting to be making love that deeply, with her still saying something and seeing her eyes never fade. I tried to hold it back as I felt myself getting nearer to climaxâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
