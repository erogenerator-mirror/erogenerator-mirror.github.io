This was a woman who had made him cum in her mind over the many years. The thought made the blood run in his veins.</p> <p>"Oh you did not say, no, I would say yes, here is a sample," she said as she opened the large glass vial. The glass tasted amazing. He had just returned from shopping, when he heard the door open again.</p> <p>"Good evening," greeted Kate as she entered the bedroom suite.</p> <p>"Yes," he replied. He couldn't believe this was the woman in the room. Not only did she resemble his ex-con, but she was the opposite of him in every conceivable manner, he thought,</p> <p>"Why did you have me bring you here, I don't recall that you actually had sex with her," he tried to play it off.</p> <p>"Well, let's just say that neither she nor I could have done what we just had," Kate replied. She was in the process of getting dressed and was only wearing a thin blue thong. It was a sexy sight.</p> <p>"Thank you Kate," he replied, "I don't know how I can repay you for all you have to say about my ex. I'm going to have to think and hope." He took the glass from her and brought it close to his lips.</p> <p>Kate walked out of the bedroom, went back into the living room and sat down across the sofa from him.</p> <p>"So how did you find out that she was here?"</p> <p>"She called, and invited me," he replied.</p> <p>"Good, it makes me more than happy that she showed up, it makes me happier and I really like your company too. So this is your ex-con?</p> <p>"Yes, Kate is now your ex-con."</p> <p>"Your ex-con? Are you ok with her seeing me?" she asked.</p> <p>"Do you want me to tell you when she sees me if it bothers you?" he asked.</p> <p>"No, I don't have to do anything. I'm ok. You can call her at anytime," she responded.</p> <p>"Thanks, Kate, you're so sweet. I'd really like to talk more sometime."</p> <p>"I'm not asking you to call her," Kate said softly. "I'm just saying that it would be nice to talk to her. She is pretty cool, and when I see her for coffee with me it's not bad. I do want to see more of them, I'm just wondering."</p> <p>"Kate, that can't happen. What happened in her room just happened here," he responded.</p> <p>"Ok," was all she said.</p> <p>"She was going to make us breakfast right now," he said.</p> <p>"Breakfast?"</p> <p>He was about to tell her to leave but had a different idea.</p> <p>"Ok, so what I really want to know is, you are going to make breakfast for us, not because she wants to, but because you might like to." He took this to mean that his plan was working.</p> <p>"Sure do," she said.</p> <p>"No, what I really want is to have my breakfast in bed with you," he said with a grin.</p> <p>"O, ok," she replied with a quick glance at his cock.</p> <p>"Kate, I told you that it is ok for me to eat here. I really want to share breakfast as my guest," he said. She thought for a second.</p> <p>"Let me finish getting ready and we can tell her that we like our eggs and toast tonight," she proposed.</p> <p>"Sounds good, thanks," he said.</p> <p>"Kate, we will do anything, just let me know," he said with a smile. She started to get ready, but he stopped her.</p> <p>"Kate, we can't, there's something else that you need to do first," he said with a grin.</p> <p>"I do too," she replied. "What else?"</p> <p>"This time of the month," he said.</p> <p>"You mean this month?"</p> <p>"Yes. Tomorrow will be good for now. Let me know."</p> <p>"Ok," she answered and smiled.</p> <p>She grabbed the ham from the refrigerator and he watched. Kate had on a pair of blue panties with a garter belt, the garter belt showed clearly. The garter belt had a nice thin leather strap which she took off. She also had on a pair of heels with black 6 and inch heels. The heels and heels were very high. She wore them just above her knees.</p> <p>"Kate, you look great," he said to her.</p> <p>"Thank you, you are so sweet," she replied.</p> <p>She left out the part about theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
