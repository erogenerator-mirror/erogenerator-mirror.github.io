"I really don't mind telling you."</p> <p>"Please can we go? We're still friends and I really need to get home. I want to tell you something."</p> <p>Her eyes were pleading all of a sudden and the look on her face just begged to be told what. She gave up looking at me and stood up to take a step down.</p> <p>"I got off work early so I didn't want to get up too early," she said. "Did you sleep well?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I did," I said with some amusement. "If you didn't make it to school by the weekend I could have been sleeping the day away anyway."</p> <p>She looked surprised for a brief moment and then smiled. "I didn't get any sleep," she said with a smile. "The next two days were hell. I was afraid to bring a pillow to wake me up."</p> <p>"I didn't do that," I laughed. "You were out so early I hardly knew you. I thought you were in your bed."</p> <p>"Oh, yeah," she said sarcastically. "But I still got the nightmares. I don't think I like them, but I don't know if I'm going to take them back."</p> <p>"Well, I didn't have them either," I said.</p> <p>She stared at me for a moment and then leaned towards me and kissed me, her lips warm as they touched mine. I felt the warm tingling of her kiss on my lips through the thin soft fabric of my sleep shirt. The warm damp feel excited me enough to my body to react but it was not enough to just wake me up.</p> <p>She pulled away from me slowly, her fingers running along her bottom lip before her teeth gently grazed my cheek. I felt an unexpected surge of satisfaction when she finally pushed open the door and led me towards her car. My breath caught in my throat as she leaned against me in the car.</p> <p>"You can look this up on the web," she whispered, sliding her hand on my cheek and dragging her lips across my face. "It's a very good thing that I'm a little old to be taking a young virgin," she said, her hand running down my torso into the waistband of my sweatpants. "I know I should rip you to pieces if my friends ever find out how much they've turned the tables on you."</p> <p>The fact that she was referring to sex didn't bother me at all. She was young and horny and I had been with very few women. But for some reason that I didn't want to take a chance on hurting her I allowed her to drag me across her knee. Then I felt her fingers slide down my underwear and she lifted my cock as I moaned softly and brought her hand to her face. She was looking at me with those beautiful blue eyes as her hand slid up my length. I'm pretty sure she could feel the wetness of pre cum on her hand as she squeezed.</p> <p>"What's your name?" she asked, her warm breath just tickling me lightly and she squeezed firmly.</p> <p>"Alex," I told her as I closed my eyes and gave her my head. "That was an awfully good one," I said, kissing her softly and letting her know how much it meant to me.</p> <p>"How did you take the time to make up to me?" she whispered. "I didn't want to get you in bed."</p> <p>I sighed. I was a little disappointed because if I could find the feeling of longing from her in my body I wanted to do it more and more. It had been very, very long since I'd been with a woman besides my wife. However, I wasn't aching for a commitment and when it came to sex I felt that something wasn't right about this situation.</p> <p>"We don't have to do this," I told her as she lifted me just enough to give her breasts a little bit extra swing.</p> <p>"We don't have to make up for what we did to each other," she whispered in response. "We can go back to being the pretty and sexy housewife and have some more fun."</p> <p>"But I want you, I want to do it every now and then when we can, and then we can go home and fuck like animals," I said as my breathing quickened.</p> <p>"So we can do it whenever and however you want. I'm sure we can find a way to keep up with other girls. I'm sure you're already good at it."</p> <p>I closed my eyes and let her hands run over my chest. Her nails on my smooth skin were sending tingles through my body making me squirm involuntarilyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
