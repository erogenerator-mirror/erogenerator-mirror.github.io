I'm pretty lucky to be able to satisfy you for so long without being sick at all. If you are still going to get a good fucking any time, you can rest assured that I will do what ever I can," he chuckled. "My cock has been hard for you as long as I can remember." His hand started to stroke the skin behind her eyes.</p> <p>"Do you think you can last much longer," he teased and watched her eyelids flutter. "I could use a little fun." His soft lips lightly brushed hers as he started to pull away from her lips. Her gaze went back to his. The look she had on her face was more innocent than anything his hand had done to her. Perhaps this would be a fun adventure as she had hinted earlier. He knew that he wouldn't regret it even if she was in danger of being killed by him.</p> <p>"If you insist," she replied, nodding. His hand slid down the side of her body till it cupped her left breast. Her nipple had started to harden at his touch. "I can't wait to fuck you," she gasped and gasped again as his hard cock rubbed against her damp sex. He continued to softly caress her body. His fingers squeezed her nipple and slid over the hardenedness.</p> <p>"You were right," he breathed his lips brushing her ear as his hand left her breast. "If we could just relax for a minute while you recover we could go from this morning's sex to next week's." His words sounded like a threat to her sanity. He watched her face to see if it was serious or if a warning was left for her to take.</p> <p>She reached up and ran her fingers over the rough scar on his cheek and pulled him down. His mouth returned to hers and his hands drifted lower to her ass. Her knees shifted to give him greater access and she gasped at the pleasure of his touch. Her sex was already drenched against his hand. When the kiss ended she reached down again and ran her fingers along the swollen head of his cock. He moaned into her mouth as she toyed with him. He was already close to blowing his load before their time had even begun. Her pussy was dripping.</p> <p>"I don't know about this," she teased back. His kisses dropped down to her breasts and licked them.</p> <p>"I don't know about this either, or this much," he answered. He kissed her deeply once more. "This is a one-time thing and we should be able to do this every day if we can. How long before you decide that you will want me to stay here with you?" She nodded, feeling her heart hammer in her chest. He pressed his lips against hers hard as he spoke and she melted into him. Her eyes fluttered closed and her hands pulled on his shoulders. He caught her hand and pulled her to him.</p> <p>His lips closed on hers just as quickly and he forced his tongue inside her mouth. She moaned into his mouth and her tongue met his as he began to explore her mouth with his. She groaned into his mouth as his fingers moved over her ass. He pressed and pressed while his body was rocking with hers. It had only been half an hour since they had left the shop. By the time they had left, she was wet between the legs as proof. Her hand moved under his shirt and found his warm chest.</p> <p>"I want this," he told her. "I want this to last forever." He kissed her again and broke the kiss, sliding slowly up to her neck and then his lips to her ear. "You can't let me go," he whispered as his lips slid down her cheek and to her breast. He kissed her there briefly and she jumped when the coolness of the air in the room touched her sensitive nipples. He watched as she gasped at the heat and sensation as he slowly slid his hand over her belly and down to her wet snatch. He lifted her shirt up and kissed the tip of her breast while his hand sought out her hard nipple. Her hands found his waist and began to pull him back to her. He looked up at her with dark circles in his eyes and took her left nipple into his mouth. She had never felt anything near this before. The sensations were indescribable. He teased her nipple with his teeth and his tongue as he sucked a little harder. His hand left her breast and slid down her stomach and over her clit. He massaged it lightly as her hands reached for him. He lowered his mouth again to her breast and her hand pulled him up.</p> <p>He lifted her hips off the seat and pushed down between her legs. She lifted them and guided them towards his throbbing cock. The head hit her hot center and she moaned a little. His hands moved back to her hips and he liftedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
