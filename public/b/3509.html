"I can't. I just had the feeling you'd be willing to get down on your knees."</p> <p>He stared at the floor for a moment. His thoughts flashed to the image of her kneeling over his face and he thought of what it would be like to do her that way - to kiss and lick her pussy like she did. To taste her juices...to drink every last drop of her pussy.</p> <p>"I can't, I can't..." he started to argue. "It's too late."</p> <p>"Come on, do it," she whispered. "Go on and lick me. Stick your tongue out. Then you can fuck my cunt."</p> <p>He stared at the carpet under his knees as he knelt there, trying to shake off the notion that he might be doing something that wasn't even remotely right.</p> <p>But it was gone quickly, for the voice of the woman she'd once been a part of was in the doorway of his room, talking quietly as she looked around. Her face was only two shades darker - perhaps a shade darker than what he felt it would be, but still beautiful. Her mouth was red, but that made it seem even more attractive, her cheeks redder. Her hair was down to her shoulders and she looked like she was almost as young as she was. Her eyes were as bright as the fire of the fire on the mantle behind her and their intensity was as sharp as he could compare.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah...oh, yeah," he heard the man shout. "That's it." His hand reached out to move over her mound - the lips parted to welcome him as his fingers pushed inside her.</p> <p>He felt her vagina open up just a little for him and then he felt the first finger slide in past the last two. She moaned, and he stared at her while she started sliding her pussy back and forth over his mouth and fingers.</p> <p>He felt her lips part - he heard her moan - felt her body quake and shiver. The sound of her moans, his own grunts, filled the room and he heard the squelch of her labia as he fucked her.</p> <p>"Oh...oh, God, yes, yes...oh, god," she moaned softly.</p> <p>"What...what do you want from me?" he whispered. His head was suddenly very sensitive.</p> <p>"I want you to, to fuck me," she replied with a littler moan. "I want my body to be full of you. I want you to fuck me, to fuck my body."</p> <p>"What do you mean?" he groaned. "Where do you want to?"</p> <p>She looked at him as he stood there, his eyes fixed on hers, the tip of his penis now very visible. He hadn't even blinked to keep from turning and looking. She smiled at his expression.</p> <p>"That," she said as she dropped to her knees. "That's where I want it. Your cock."</p> <p>She took him in her mouth and closed the distance between them. He couldn't see her face, but when he felt the warmth of her mouth surrounded him he knew she could do whatever she wanted with him. He closed his eyes. He felt, more than heard the woman's voice. His heart was beating faster and faster but he could still hear her voice over his head.</p> <p>"Yeah, lick me," he heard her say as she lowered her head.</p> <p>The sounds that he could faintly hear floated into his ears, as if that existed just for his ears alone, he thought, a part of what he knew he wouldn't be able to say and what he must never tell anyone...anyone. What they felt...what they would all experience...what they would do to him.</p> <p>That was what he would do to her.</p> <p>She took his cock deep in her mouth as he felt himself start to move his hips up to meet her. The feeling was not what he expected - she was not what he expected. It was the sort of feeling he'd wanted, the kind of feeling he'd desired - the sort of feeling he'd expected he wouldn't get for a long time.</p> <p>She felt as though she'd been holding onto him for ages, a hand gripping his hip as she pulled away and then pulled him back into her...her mouth sucking hard on him as she continued to suck on him.</p> <p>That was the type of feeling he'd wanted, a sort of desire, to be with her, to be inside her for ever. So he pulled his hands up from her hips and put them on her head as he slowly fucked her face...it went from deep in his groin to just under her nose and then up again to just above his belly button.</p> <p>"Like that?" she asked, her voice husky and thick with passionâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
