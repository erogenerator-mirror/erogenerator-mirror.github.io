He grabbed a handful of my hair and pulled me back until I almost hit him between the eyes. "You are going to be good girl, aren't you, sissyboy?" he asked, laughing.</p> <p>"Yes," I answered, blushing at being called that as I stood on the porch, legs spread, arms bound behind me.</p> <p>"Good girl, get the little things ready. I want you to bring them inside and then come here so I can fuck you." He ordered.</p> <p>I hurried into the house, still naked, walking to the door as he led me out. I quickly pulled my hands above my head, and looked through the door. There, waiting for me, was the black leather strap, I had seen hanging on the frame of his home in my office. It had been used by a couple times before, but I didn't have much experience.</p> <p>He looked at it with amusement and amusement until the words left his lips, "Hurry back, sissy, the things are waiting in the closet." He commanded.</p> <p>"Yes, Master," I said, my face blushing red. I hurried back into the house, and returned to the room, carrying the little things which had been made out to me. Both of us were trembling as I handed them off to him. Standing there, looking at my naked body, he smiled broadly. "So hot and pretty," he said.</p> <p>"Thank you, Sir!" I answered, reaching forward to caress his thigh. I pulled back, and gave it a soft kiss as I leaned down to give it a kiss. I felt his hand reach up and grab my hair, and he pulled me down by my head, and bent me over at the waist. I felt his weight, his hands reaching under and caressing me, his fingers tracing lines up and down my sides. I was trembling, my arms still tied behind my back and down, and he pushed the ties that held me against him up and out of my sight. He stood me up and led me to his bed, and helped me lay back. We began undressing each other, taking our time, both of us eager and excited. He began to undress, first, dropping the clothes off, and laying out on his back on his bed. I lay down on his body, as he lay flat on his back. He took a large handkerchief from his dresser, and with it he began wiping himself down, covering me with it. I lay my head on his chest, and ran my fingers from his balls to his nose. I traced his nipples with my fingertips, then reached down to kiss his chest, pulling up on his nipples to make him grunt. I ran my fingers down his chest, to his belly, and across his thighs. He raised his legs to give me better access to his body. His penis was sticking straight out between his legs and up into the air, as I began to play with it with my fingers.</p> <p>He pushed me back slightly, and pulled me up to straddle his hips, his arms holding me in place as he brought my breasts to his lips. He leaned forward, taking me into his mouth. He sucked my breasts, taking the hard nubs in between his teeth. My back arched, trying to get away from his mouth. I moaned against his chest, and he looked up to see if he could see where we were, between my legs and on the floor. As he continued to suck my breasts and lick and nibble my nipples, he pushed me back off his lap, and moved to his bed. He lay me down on the bed, taking off his shoes as he moved to his side of the bed. He reached down and grabbed his penis, sliding it up and down my slit, coating the entire length. I had already been wet, but when he began to put the head of it up against me, I was completely exposed. He pushed my legs back farther, spreading me open. As if reading my mind, he reached up and ran a finger around my opening, opening my labia to expose my pink interior. He brought the head of his penis to me, and slid it slowly in. He did not wait. He rubbed it up and down the entire length of my slit several times, teasing me as he watched me. He stopped just short of penetration and began moving it in and out of me, pushing a little more each time until I was moving with it. He pulled me down to his belly, and continued his motion while his other hand came up to my breasts. He began massaging the soft, smooth flesh and my nipples. I began to move with him as our bodies slid together, each thrust being met by the movement of our bodies.</p> <p>For the next several minutes I felt an orgasm buildingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
