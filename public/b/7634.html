Or that one was actually awake! We'd better go! "</p> <p>"We couldn't! I'm not like your father, he's much more shy about me than your father," he whispered.</p> <p>I reached for his shirt. I was surprised and a little embarrassed, that you see such things so often. But when you first see me, you don't think I'm fat! I'm about the same size as your father, so... I don't mind that a lot! "</p> <p>We got back together right out of the door, and headed for the beach. We didn't say much, just watched the waves dance around the lake's surface. He sat down and leaned back on his elbows. He spread his legs, and I saw his hard penis, standing up between them. I put my hand on it and started jerking him off... I saw him put his hand on his own penis and started to rub it. He leaned his head forward and kissed the side of my neck... I leaned against him and kissed his mouth...</p> <p>I turned my head and put it on his penis... The skin was so warm... And I began to stroke him... It was like I was kissing a hot woman, sucking at his penis... I was so lost in my own sensations I didn't hear him... I began to moan gently... and when I moved my head back, I saw it shoot on his belly... I felt his penis jump, and the first shot bounced off his body. I looked at it and saw, he was breathing heavily, his eyes locked on mine... my heart was racing, and my dick was getting hard again. I moved myself closer until it was touching his thigh, and I was right up against his crotch... It was warm, so strong, and I realized, maybe we had something in common.</p> <p>He brought his head to mine and we kissed... Our naked bodies were touching everywhere. But as with all things, we were both thinking at the same time, at the same moment. We began to kiss again, and our lips parted... He was still jacking off into my hand... I moved my hand and brought it to his penis... I stroked his prick up and down along with my fingers, the skin in my hand so smooth.</p> <p>I lay back on the beach, and he knelt beside me. His wet cock touched my thigh, and I took it in my hand. He put his hand on my belly and spread my legs apart. I felt his fingers touch my vagina... there was no feeling at all, I was completely wet and warm. There was also nothing else to be done...</p> <p>"It's all right, you can touch me there," I said.</p> <p>He took his hand and put it to my vagina, opening me up. His fingers slid inside me, and I felt my legs get weak... I felt so relaxed...</p> <p>But his fingers didn't just move in a different spot... they went around... I kept feeling them moving around my vagina, sliding around my clitoris... He had found my G-Spot... and I felt myself getting wet again. I laid back more... I opened up my legs more, so he could find his way inside me. I put one leg over his shoulder, and he moved his head lower... my vagina was wide open, and he saw the small opening in the middle... I spread my feet apart... I was in total surrender...</p> <p>It was a strange place, but it felt so right to have this man's tongue on me, his fingers in me... It was like I was in a trance... and his tongue was doing something that felt like a dream. I don't know how, if it felt right for him... but somehow I felt happy with this, and I didn't want it to stop...</p> <p>I saw that his penis was moving in and out of my palm... I knew I would make him come... he was moving around in me so much... it felt so good. I felt like I couldn't believe what I was feeling... and I was really glad it wasn't the first time I had done this... I just wanted to enjoy it. My hand was stroking him, and I felt him tense and then I heard his moan...</p> <p>It seemed like he was coming for a long time... I didn't let him come before he had my vagina all wet again... As he continued stroking me, I kept my legs spread wide apart and felt my vagina and breasts all flushed and full of his juices. He leaned forward and kissed me... I was still on my elbows, so he put me down on the sandy beach and stood up, taking me with him to kiss my mouth, my breasts, and my body.</p> <p>"Let's go back inside, shall we?
