I'd love to wake up next to you." With that his arms went around me and he snuggled against my head. I wrapped my arms around their thighs. If you are a lucky guy this is a good thing and a wonderful thing. So here we lay naked in each other's arms.</p> <p>"I like the bed."</p> <p>"I'm more than a little surprised you came to the bedroom this way." I said, stroking their hair.</p> <p>"I do. But if you'll forgive my rudeness, I'd like to go again. You are both gorgeous. Yours is probably the best one I've ever had."</p> <p>"And you know it? I've been thinking for ages. How will you take him?"</p> <p>The way I'd been looking at them as we slept that morning was so sexy it was almost painful. I wanted to be as naughty as I could be.</p> <p>"I'll take care of whatever demands you have."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Maybe you could be the one to teach me." I smiled and rolled away taking his cock with me. It had never been in my mouth before and it felt so good to stroke it. It wasn't the size of it but it was different.</p> <p>As I was giving the shaft a few gentle licks I felt his fingers tracing the top of my head. I felt it as it moved down towards my mouth and slowly slipped under the hair of my pussy. I moved slightly forward trying to let him have access to me but he kept pulling back. I felt as his fingers slid around my opening and in a few seconds of my wanting he was entering me. It felt like a first in it wasn't that long and he was in all the way. I groaned with pleasure and gave him a quick kiss.</p> <p>"Come on my head." I said, as they had the previous and I moved to face his shoulder. "I need a breather."</p> <p>"I wouldn't want you to breath if we woke."</p> <p>"I haven't been the least bit worried about any of that, that's for sure. I'm fine. I want you to try, but let me have a bit of fun first."</p> <p>I wanted him as naked as he was, so I kissed him very lightly on the lips. It was a sensuous kiss. His arms snaked around me and he slowly slipped out from under me. I looked down at his cock. It was hard.</p> <p>"Do you feel like you've been taking some kind of vitamins?" I asked.</p> <p>"I have."</p> <p>"Good! I bet they have. When I've had you in hand all day I'd be willing to show you how much I love you with your lovely cock."</p> <p>With that, I slipped my fingers into his hair, as I started to stroke him. I felt him shiver and gasp. This did it! I began a long slow stroking along the length of his staff and watched his body jerk each time I touched him. As I stroked him he started to buck against me. I knew I could feel him in me.</p> <p>"That feels so good." He managed to say between gasps. "I've dreamed about making love to you all day and now it's about to happen."</p> <p>"Well then I'm so glad you've got that."</p> <p>"I think I could say the same about you." He said, sliding me under with his legs and wrapping them around me. He was lying on top of me and my legs were spread so wide apart that his cock was rubbing against my clit. I felt it move against me and knew he was able to do it.</p> <p>His fingers continued to play my body all over; stroking my pussy and my cheeks, teasing the hole that was so wet because it was so sensitive. I was surprised all at the speed and intensity of him playing with me. But I felt a bit of excitement because I knew they were making love to me.</p> <p>"Do you want to go a little faster? Or do you want me to go faster?" I asked.</p> <p>"Let's go slow. You can do me a lot slower if you can."</p> <p>Well, I'm gonna try a lot better than that. I could take my time and be good. He really had me in his arms. It was wonderful feeling him in me and when I felt myself start to tremble and the first wave of climaxes started, it was all right and we didn't make love before I'd finally had this man. It was everything I ever wanted, everything I needed. I could feel him in the warm flesh of my tummy; it was a feeling that I always felt whenever I was touched there. In a way it was as if I had a little part of him; an part thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
