"Just watch."</p> <p>Liam's erection was starting to get harder. He started to massage his right shoulder and worked his way down to that area. Liam had no problem with working on his left shoulder, but the fact wasn't that he did any. He knew that it would always happen eventually, so once it happened, it would. After all, what happens in porn films is what happens on TV and in movies and the internet. He turned his head, and was looking right at his cock.</p> <p>"Can I do that for you, Sir?" he asked.</p> <p>As he smiled at Liam, he reached out, placing his hands on Liam's shoulders, and pushed him a little. Liam pushed back, and then leaned back, placing his hands on the massage table top.</p> <p>"If you want a little massage, Sir, you'll have to go first," she said.</p> <p>Liam got his balance, sliding his hands up and down his shoulder blades. His right hand started at the base, slowly coming up from the top of the towel. From there, his hands moved up until you could just touch the top of his head and back down. He continued, starting at the small of his back, and gradually working it back up. Once he got to his shoulders, he slid his hands back down his shoulders, and began to massage. He was amazed that he could do it. He felt amazing, like he had the energy and the will to do anything. He wanted to keep doing this. He felt like he had control over himself, but even more, since he had this much power and control over one person and the opposite sex.</p> <p>Liam was becoming so lost in this process that he wasn't noticing that he had stopped the massage. He turned to see his right hand, lying on the table right beside his left shoulder, and his left, on the other side, with his hand behind his head. His whole body was relaxed, and he seemed to be breathing deeply. He looked up. He loved seeing his cock. It felt so good to be as a human being, but he needed to be a part of a new experience, not just a body. His cock wasn't even hard, but it was hard enough for him to make all the difference, just enough so that he could feel it inside. He leaned back, looking at his left shoulder, and as he closed his eyes, he felt himself get even harder.</p> <p>"Do you still want to feel me? I want to feel you in my hands."</p> <p>It felt good to admit it, but when he felt her, it just made him feel that much more relaxed. He reached down to his left hand and grabbed his cock. It was so hard that it seemed as if it was going to split and scream right in his face. He leaned back on the table, pulling his ass towards him. Once he did and his legs were closed, it felt so much easier to move his cock in and out of the air. It felt so good to be able to come in her hands. A part of him actually hated himself and the others for thinking it was wrong. He leaned back fully on the table, holding his legs up in the air while spreading his ass cheeks with both hands.</p> <p>"I love the feeling of your cock in my hands," she said.</p> <p>"Yeah, you do," Liam said.</p> <p>She started using both hands to work his upper body. One hand found its way to his cock, which he knew was hard, and the other found his face, and rubbed it. She was massaging both his cheeks with one hand as he was massaging his cock. She pushed his head down so that he was fully on his hands. His face was on an upside-down position, and he could see from his own weight that his cock was pointing straight at her. She saw it, and moved to get an even better angle on it with her head. She wanted his cock so wet that it would slide right up inside of her in no time at all. She saw the pre-come starting to drip out of the head of his cock. She got her face in position to watch the sight. She then reached out and wrapped her fingers around the bottom of the shaft and slowly pumped.</p> <p>"What the fuck, are you crazy?" Liam said. "Look, I don't even get to see it," he said, trying to get as close and as close as he could while being as far up in the air as he could. He looked at his cock as it was pointed right at her. He could feel the slight movement of the skin. He liked the look of it. Like something out of an old-time movie, that's what it looked like when you look at it from the front. That's how he looked at cock whenever he sawâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
