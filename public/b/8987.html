The master bedroom was right next to the kitchen and had four bedrooms, each with an off-callable bathroom. The living room area was the kitchen/kitchen area and the master bathroom was directly across the living room section from the master bedroom, which was the only bedroom other than the living room. A king-size bed dominated the room, large screen TV, stereo system and a small television mounted on one wall was just three doors away. On the back of the sliding door was the staircase that led to the loft.</p> <p>As we approached the loft we could hear voices, followed by laughter and a man and a woman. "Come join us if you would," the woman said. "Please, come see the master bedroom."</p> <p>I went up on the landing to stand at the foot of the loft. "That's my room," I said, "The Master bedroom is right here, right down the hall on the right."</p> <p>"Yes, Sir," she responded. "It's a very nice place."</p> <p>My guess was that they were having a lot of fun, because they were standing in the loft waiting as we approached. As I stood in the doorway with my head down in the loft looking at the woman standing beside the first bedroom door, the door that ran down from the other side opened, and the women appeared, all three women naked. They led me further into the loft, the stairs leading directly to the bedroom. They stopped in front of the room and turned to face me. "Come in, come in," the women said, "It's very warm out there. Don't be embarrassed. There's nothing to be ashamed of in here."</p> <p>"Thank you, Sir," the woman said as she stepped into the room, "Very nice, too."</p> <p>The man entered the loft first, followed by the woman and the man, as well as the woman, who each moved toward me on their own. The two women were dressed only in short, silky, see-through negligees; each had a small black dildo strapped to her body, which was dangling from the base of her large, firm breasts. The man was completely nude (except for his flaccid cock hanging from the top of his thigh) and he approached me. "Well, well," he said in his deep, gravelly tones as he looked at me closely, "This isn't what it looks like. Are you a stranger?"</p> <p>"A few years ago," I replied. "What are you doing here?"</p> <p>"We're here to play," the woman said. "We're here to have an evening out if you please."</p> <p>I turned around very slowly. "Thank you," I said, "but I'm an unknown guest here."</p> <p>"But you do know that you are here, do you not? Then, if you think you have the privacy of the bedroom, then you can follow us here." The couple moved closer to me and approached my waist, hands on my hips. A tall, thin man, perhaps in his late fifties or early sixties (I later learned that he was almost forty), was reaching out to touch me. He leaned forward and kissed me, then stepped back and continued his exploration of my body. I could see what I had been expecting but had been afraid to ask. I realized that it was my imagination, not one of the men's, but the man's. The man had already begun to touch me through the thin night robe, and moved to his knees and removed the cover-up. His hands went to my own, touching me, gently, pulling the robe apart. As he slipped his right hand inside, I watched his hand slide up and down my chest, over my stomach and my legs. Then his finger found my wet pussy. I felt his finger enter me as my own moved inside me to feel the softness of his finger as he slipped it deeply and then removed it. I could tell that he was taking little, tentative breaths; I watched closely as he closed the robe about me and folded it up to hold it in front of me. He pulled the light covering down, exposing my stomach, breasts and flat stomach. "It's a beautiful body," he said.</p> <p>"You're really beautiful, Sir," I replied as I reached up and pulled the covers away and spread my legs apart to give my husband the best and deepest entry possible. I looked up to see the two women, one tall and thin, one tall and petite and slender, both wearing only the tiny panties that they were wearing, which they had worn all through dinner. The one that was the shorter of the two smiled as she stepped around the side of the bed. She reached up to her breasts to tug at her nipples, smiling at me as she did so. â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
