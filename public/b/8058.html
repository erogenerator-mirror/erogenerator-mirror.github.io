Almost eight o'clock and it seemed an eternity to the day. I got up as the clock struck seven. Then I felt a sharp pain in my left butt cheek. No, oh no. I had the strangest sensation in my left side at first, but after a sharp pain from a sharp pain to my right hip for a second time, just as the pain started to return to my left side I thought I'd fallen out of a tree!</p> <p>"Wow! Now that hurts like hell! I feel like I'm going back in some bad movie. Why did you have to go through this?" I heard Brian shout as I walked out from under the table, still trying to stand off of the floor.</p> <p>"Don't worry, you just had to pee. I'll take care of it. You've been on your way to the bathroom for fifteen minutes now. So, now the pain to your right leg is almost gone.</p> <p>I looked down to see that most of the pain had gone. And I had to piss.</p> <p>I took my shirt off, threw it on the kitchen chair, and then I took the stool in the hallway, which was about twenty feet long, and then sat down again to pee.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I can see your face. Please don't be angry with me, it was just an accident." I tried to sit down again. "Here, keep talking while I get you some water."</p> <p>I reached down to the top shelf beside the toilet. "Here, hold this." I pulled the shelf out of a pile on top of the rest of the stuff in the room. I turned the water tap on as I sat, then I turned and tried to get back into the seat. I looked around, searching for more.</p> <p>"Here, hold these," I said as I handed him a small plastic container. "This should help your leg to go in. Here, hold these." I opened the container and he brought it down to my right leg. He brought the container down over my right hip and up my right leg to my knee, then brought it down again. He repeated the process until the entire side of my thigh was soaked.</p> <p>"Thank you." I said as I was finishing up my glass. "You might want to rest your leg. It's probably better if you rest it again. But you might want to take a sip of water."</p> <p>"Water." Brian said. "That's for me." He stood up and walked over to me as I started to stand up. He had his shirt off and he removed his pants. In the time that we had been sitting there Brian had been rubbing my leg like nothing happened.</p> <p>But now Brian was standing right in front of me! And he was rubbing it!</p> <p>It started to be like a fire going off inside my body. It was like I was in a constant state of tingly tingly, and I wanted to reach out and touch him. I pulled my shirt off and Brian looked down at my breasts.</p> <p>His eyes traveled down my body, over my stomach and up to my face and back down to my breasts. He looked at my face, then back down to my breasts as he started to rub my clit. His fingers felt the full length of my clit, while his other hand was rubbing my nipple, which was stiff.</p> <p>I started to lift up my leg.</p> <p>"Not yet," I heard Brian say. "Now you do it for me, too. It's okay."</p> <p>"Okay," I replied as I reached out and touched the back of his legs. I reached around him and grabbed his ass, pulling him towards me.</p> <p>A little more pressure. Not so much, but some more. Brian's face lit up like a sun-star as I pulled him closer. Then a little more pressure as he took my hand and then placed it on his cock.</p> <p>The head was in my hand as I stroked him. I felt him jump in my hand. He wasn't going to cum, but it had to be his first time. My hand felt it.</p> <p>"Wow," I heard him say. "This is going to be very, very nice." I was smiling, but I didn't really feel good about that.</p> <p>One thing that my body felt good about was sex. Brian had given me what I had tried to put on for years. So why was I doing nothing at all about my need to cum? Was there a connection.</p> <p>It must have been because it was the night of the fourth, the day of a big sales-day, something to celebrate. It wasn't the first time, but it was a special occasion. I just wanted to be his.</p> <p>He moved his cock up and down, slowly. It would move around inside meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
