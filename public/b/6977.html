"I'm just glad that's not going to be a problem in the future" he continued.</p> <p>"Thank you sir" I said, "I think I'll need a bit of extra help to help you clean up and I'm really looking forward to working with you" I told him. I reached for his hand and then, realizing it was not really needed, I pulled him down next to me and gently placed a tender kiss on his lips, taking his hand away first, and then put it on my leg, placing it right next to my pussy. He wrapped his hand around it and ran his fingers around it. I kissed him and let him slip his finger inside me. "Does that help you?" I asked, smiling as he brought the finger to his lips and sucked on it. I looked at him as he fingered me. It wasn't the first sexual attention I'd gotten, but I don't think even him had been into anything like this in some time. His fingertips were so soft, so warm. It really came as no surprise to me that, as he looked into my eyes, he would soon be tasting my pussy. "I think I'm not going to be able to keep this up all day, Sir" I said quietly, "But I'm sure it will help in the future" I added, knowing it wasn't going to be a problem.</p> <p>He smiled and kissed me again. "Ok" he said, "Thank you for this job! I always know that you're special!" I smiled as I kissed him again and then pulled up onto the next shoe. He laughed as I put the second shoe on, the thin and lacy thing. "I think this will help me clean up a bit" he said, looking at me, "I think it's time to get the shower up and ready!" I smiled and nodded, pulling the shower curtain closed and then stepping into the cubicle.</p> <p></p> <p>As I started up my shower, I felt his hand close around my left ankle. He pulled me forward, pushing me into his shower, pushing my foot back and forth. He kissed me and then took my left foot in his right hand, running his hand slowly from the arch of it up to the top inch, then back down to the foot, back again, over and over. I moaned as his fingers ran along the bottom of the arch, massaging the arch with his thumb. I put my hand around his neck, kissing him and whispering that he should lick it, to clean his fingers. He smiled and I could feel his hard chest pressing against my chest, and his hard little cock, pressed against my belly through his shorts.</p> <p>"Is it going to be ok if I clean your back?" I asked as I grabbed the soap. I started with his shoulders then my hands, then down his back making sure everything was cleaned. It didn't take long until I was washing his chest, arms, and his back. "Your chest is soft" I said, "but you are so big" and I took my time going down on his chest, running my tongue along the outer ridge of his little man, before pulling my head back up, and kissing him once more. As his hands ran through my hair, I put my hands behind my back again, and started to rub the soap in to my hands. The soap made that even harder. I took my hands and went up to his shoulders, just holding them there. I moved back down to his chest and started to wash his stomach, arms, and legs. When I got to his feet, he did the same. I finished off his legs and began to wash his feet. His toes were so sexy, I wanted to stroke them but again, I'd decided this was my time, not his. I washed each of his legs and he stepped under the water. "You seem to be a bit tense, Sir, do you need a foot rub?" I asked as I lifted his leg and washed it gently. He lifted his head and watched as I cleaned his cock. "How about a foot rub?" I asked as I finished his leg and stepped back up, still holding his foot. "Ok, sir" he said, standing. I began to wash his cock again as he rubbed his arms, he was really good at that, not like the girls I'd been with. "I'll be back" I said, and closed the curtain. As I picked up my shower robe and followed him back into the bathroom, not saying a word, the door was open and I was able to look at him. He had his back to me, but I could see that his eyes were closed. His head was turned away from me so it was difficult to see his eyes from the other side ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
