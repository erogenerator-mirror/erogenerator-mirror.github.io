His eyes were glued to her body and I think both her and I could see his cock pressing up against it. He wasn't going anywhere for the first few seconds as he took in the view, and I think he found it alluring. He pulled me onto my knees and took a few steps closer. I looked up at him and he was nodding. I think he figured I wanted him to take control, and I don't think he ever was before. I'm not sure what that meant, but when he was moving it, I was doing it, not him. He reached down and unzipped his jeans, letting them fall to the ground.</p> <p>His cock was now semi-erect and his lips moved to my earlobe. "Mmm," he whispered, "it's been awhile." he whispered.</p> <p>I didn't want to tease him, so I just took his cock in my hand and began to stroke it. It was growing quickly between my fingers and he groaned as he felt my tongue moving around his head. I felt his fingers entwine in my hair and we watched each other closely. He ran his fingers through my hair as I stroked his tool.</p> <p>"I love this little cocktease," he whispered, and then he pulled me up so that he could kiss me. I was on all fours now and he got behind me. He rubbed himself against my tight ass and I tried to pull away but I knew that he wouldn't. Then he began rubbing a finger lightly up and down my little asshole before he began to rub my clit. I moaned a bit as he began to slowly finger my tiny rosebud. He did the same thing to my pussy and I began to rock on his fingers as his hot cock slid easily along my wet slit and into my hot depths.</p> <p>"I want to try something," he said softly, and that was all the encouragement needed. He lifted my ass and slowly slid his cock into me very carefully. I felt like a ragdoll as he slid deep into me and I wanted to pull away. Suddenly he stopped. I felt his hot juices against my sphincter and then he pulled out, and then I felt the cool air as he spread it around. We remained silent until the hot night breeze cleared away the fog from our blinds and he reached out and brushed a stray strand of hair off my face.</p> <p>I was in shock, it was only a short distance to the lake, but it had been hours since I had felt him inside me. I didn't want to stop him, I just wanted to get there. I felt so dirty, but so hot. I couldn't help but slide my hand down and rub my pussy.</p> <p>"Damn, he said," and with that, he lifted my legs. I had never felt anything like what I felt for Eric. It wasn't as big as Eric's. There were bigger and longer cocks like his, and I didn't expect to find such a thing. It was a moment of ecstasy to have him inside me before I was completely brokenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
