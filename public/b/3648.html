Can we just go for a quick walk around? I don't want to be interrupted." She reached over and grabbed my crotch, sending a tingle through my thighs. "Mmmm, you're still hard."</p> <p>I smiled and nodded as we made our way back to the house. "There you go. Just a quick flash with you." Her hand still rubbing my crotch, I felt like I was melting. I was definitely going to feel better when she let me get away with it.</p> <p>"I think I'll get a drink and relax for a bit."</p> <p>"No, I'll just sit and play video games with the guys, if you'd rather. I really like that game and you were great."</p> <p>"Ok, I'll take care of the other guys for them."</p> <p>"No, you don't have to go." She took the keys from under the table and slid it back inside my jeans pocket. "I'll get my keys."</p> <p>She was sitting where she left me just feet away. She put the key into her pocket and tucked the remote back inside. "Well, I'll see you Monday." She kissed me and headed out of the restaurant. I thought she was being nice, but she didn't know it. "You know."</p> <p>++++++++++++++++</p> <p>I woke up to find it dark inside my room. I was startled when I realized it had been a while. After getting a fresh, hot shower, I lay down in my bed and was just about to get out of bed when a knock on the door startled me. "Room service."</p> <p>"Shit!" I rolled over, staring across the expanse of my naked body to the door. "That shit! She got back in last night." I closed my eyes and rolled the light over. I didn't want to think of the last thing I would ever see. Finally, I could sit up all of a sudden and try to figure out what it meant. Did she see me...did she get it all...</p> <p>"The food was really good. I should have had breakfast for you. How about you?" My eyes were still closed and as a matter of fact, she had gotten up early, but this morning I would have never guessed it in this light.</p> <p>"I'm good thanks. I'll be in the kitchen. I left it downstairs when I came up." She stood there for a moment, waiting for a response in her voice. "I didn't mean to interrupt, but this food was so good...I don't know if I can handle all this right now." I walked over to the door. "Just wait here, please." She turned and walked back to the kitchen.</p> <p>My eyes were wide with confusion. "I have a date with her. You know, to go on a date." I had no clue about what her date was going to be. I didn't know who she was or what's she looking for. I had to wonder if it was her or whether she was going to be interested in me. She was, that was enough to make my jaw drop.</p> <p>Her face was now covered by the bedsheet. I could feel my heart beating wildly, my cock had already begun to pulse. She quickly walked over and knelt down beside the bed. "Can you keep up with me?" she asked, staring up at me with those beautiful eyes.</p> <p>"Of course I can." I looked down at her and grinned. Her hair was disheveled, but it was all right. "What's up? You have to meet with her. I can't promise anything, but I am sure she doesn't live here."</p> <p>Her expression was as soft as her fingers. "You must. I had a good time last night. A lot of fun. I'm hoping you will want to go out again."</p> <p>I just chuckled. "I would love to see you again. If you'd like to come stay a while and watch a movie with me, your choice is fine by me."</p> <p>She smiled and leaned over to kiss me, "Let's go take a quick shower and get cleaned up. I've still got room service."</p> <p>We kissed for what seemed like the thousandth time that night, then she said, "I'll take you home. It's a long drive."</p> <p>We didn't talk the entire long drive until we got back to the hotel. She quickly walked to her room when my flight was almost ready. I walked her to the door and was delighted to see that it had only been a minute, but I still had a few other pictures to take, so it took about fifteen minutes. I had also put my laptop in the room to start when we walked past. It was just in time to see her go to change out of that skimpy uniform of hers; in fact, I didn't evenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
