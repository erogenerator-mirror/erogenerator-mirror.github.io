You're not supposed to touch me but, um, I can think of another scenario where I get to taste you and if I do, would you do whatever you like with me?"</p> <p>Troy took a deep shaky breath. "Um, how would I be able to do that?"</p> <p>"Well I'm a professional dominatrix, a dominatrix with many subs such as you. You were, uh, at the front end of a domme demonstration, how shall we say, some kind of slut. I'd have you do whatever I said, just as in this, do you understand?"</p> <p>Troy wasn't sure what was to be expected of this woman. There might be other things he could do. "Do you have experience with BDSM?"</p> <p>"Yes, actually," she replied, "I have never been able to teach my submissive to do anything but enjoy it. In fact, I can't get more than two orgasms a day without thinking about it, but I've been so hot lately that I've spent all day practicing a new technique."</p> <p>"I see," said Troy. "What is it?"</p> <p>"It's actually a bit of a turn-off," she said, pulling her skirt down. She was wearing white cotton panties which had a narrow strip of fabric covering her pubic hair. "My mistress prefers that we wear clothes that show a bit of skin, and when she is ready for the next session, we can wear shorts or skirts and blouses, or, if you're comfortable, if you prefer just shorts and a t-shirt. I normally wear underwear around me, as you're not used to seeing anything in a woman. My mistress is a bit more comfortable if it is a blouse without bra or panties, and her skirt is much better. That would be easy to take off and model naked for you." She opened the top drawer and found what she was looking for. "She might also want you to buy me some lingerie if you think you're up for modeling."</p> <p>Troy couldn't take his eyes off of her. "No, this would be nice, especially since you're just my domme."</p> <p>"You're not too old?"</p> <p>"No, well not old for subbie subs like you," he said. "I'll just go see how to get you in the mood, then, and if it's good for you... Well, just remember that it is me who is to do something and, if you like being subbie, you might like everything else as well."</p> <p>"You'll do fine. I don't mind being subbie is all. When were you leaving school?"</p> <p>"In a couple of months, I'm going back to college. I'm just going out of school myself."</p> <p>"That's great. There'll be an art class on Tuesdays and Thursdays." Troy's mouth opened but no words came out. He stared at her for a moment and then said, "I just couldn't wait to try this if it was a session with you and I can be the instructor. Can you do that?"</p> <p>"Oh, of course. I'd love to start now."</p> <p>Troy stood, and grabbed his coat and headed to the door. She was right, he thought, she is just the hottest domme he's ever seen. He was wondering what she thought about his choice of clothes. "Bye," he said. He took off out the front door, but stopped at his own. As he got to the other side of the street he saw her smiling back at him. Her lips were smiling, which was a little unnerving. Was she flirting with him? He thought so, and he couldn't help smiling back. She just seemed happy to see him, not in a sex-kitten look, but something else she must. She looked sexy and confident. He felt a strange sense of satisfaction. He knew he loved her too.</p> <p>She was about twenty-six. She'd got to the point of not using much to dress herself, she'd decided on baggy shorts and a short sleeve shirt. She still looked good in a dress. He was starting to think maybe it was finally time to call it a day and he couldn't have it. Troy would wait, but he wasn't a sadist about it. He knew what he had to do. He had to keep his cool. He had to. He'd wait until she got home and give her the full course and he needed to get a grip. He'd wait and hope. It had to be her and Troy.</p> <p>He turned to look at the house and noticed it was empty. Maybe he ought have thought about that first. The only things that were occupied were her bedroom and her desk. What could she have been doing in there ifâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
