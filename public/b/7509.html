She reached up and stroked his cheek. "I'm not in the habit of spending long nights together alone though," he assured her as he wrapped her in his strong arms.</p> <p>"I know." His lips brushed her ear with a soft sigh. "I'll even catch up to you."</p> <p>"I'd like that." She let him lead her back to the bed and climbed onto it. She lay back, waiting as his lips covered hers in one long kiss, the one that had awakened the fire. Her hand trailed over his chest as he explored her mouth with his tongue, their naked skin pressed against each other. He felt the heat of her arousal as he rolled over her and held her close. She felt his chest against hers and his hard nipple pressing against her stomach. He lifted himself atop her, lifting up on his arms to make room before he lowered himself to the juncture between her legs. She felt the cool flesh of the head of his erection press against her and inhaled as his mouth closed over her neck and shoulders. She watched as he began to move against her, his hips rocking into hers rhythmically as his hands slid over her body. He lowered his hard cock to her thigh, pushing it against the heat between her legs. Her hips jerked against him as the warm flesh of his cock rubbed against her swollen pearl.</p> <p>Her voice broke the spell which they were about to fall over again. "I want you inside me," she whispered hotly as she arched her back. "I want to feel you come inside me."</p> <p>"Are you sure?" He teased as he watched her face. He was no longer the man she had always dreamed of, but he would make her come again. "I'm sure."</p> <p>"Yes, just right." She pulled her knees up to her chest, spreading her legs as he took his hard length in hand and guided the swollen head past her swollen outer lips. Then she felt him enter her.</p> <p>"Ah." He felt her tremble as her tight walls enveloped his cock. "Just like this," He murmured in her ear.</p> <p>"I knew you would," she whispered huskily. Their bodies joined together as she felt him move in and out of her. He held himself above her as she rode him. A smile curved his lips as he felt his cock grow to the size of his finger and felt her walls tighten against the length of him. "Oh god," He gasped as his cock began to shoot hot jizz into her. "You're gonna make me come," he added, his eyes darkening with desire.</p> <p>"Yes." She felt his hot breath on her neck as his fingers gripped her hips as he pumped his come into her.</p> <p>"You better get out of here," he said as he rolled to her side. "I'm starving."</p> <p>"I need to go clean up before I go." She pushed herself up on her elbows and looked into his eyes. "I have to stay just the way I was," she told him. "After I clean up, I'll probably be back on the plane."</p> <p>The two looked at each other, their faces still searing with desire. She reached out and ran her fingertip over his lips tasting herself as he trembled against her. They were alone at that moment. He felt the need to run. He kissed her softly and pulled her close to him, holding her for a while before moving from his chair and walking to the door. He stood, waiting for her to get up, before sliding to the floor, kneeling beside her. "Are you ok, love?" He said.</p> <p>"As always," she whispered as her fingers ran along the warm flesh of his chest. "I love you, Chris."</p> <p>"And I love you, too," he answered as he pushed himself off of her. She could feel his hardness pressing against her hip, rubbing against the wet cloth of the nightie she was wearing. He took her arm and pulled her to her feet as she watched him walk away. "I'll see you at dinner, I guess," she added, glancing toward the bathroom.</p> <p>"Good idea, sweetheart. And, by the way... you can't leave me hanging. I'd like to be alone for a while."</p> <p>"I know." She couldn't stop herself from laughing despite the fact that the two of them had just finished what felt like the longest-est date ever. "Goodnight, my Love." She kissed her husband on the cheek, feeling the heat of the fire dance across him, then kissed him again. "Goodnight, my love," she whispered back to him before she disappeared into the houseâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
