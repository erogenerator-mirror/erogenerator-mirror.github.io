It's not working, it's getting harder to hold on as I push myself off the couch.</p> <p>I hear you come behind me. My eyes meet your with your cock sliding in and out of me. The sound of our bodies smacking together is so sexy. You can feel my ass moving against you every time you shove up into me. Your balls are slapping against my clit every time you move up into me. Your balls are slapping my clit every time I move down onto you. It's so hot. I can feel my body temperature increasing. My ass is getting ready to orgasm again. I'm moaning, you're groaning, we're both in heaven. I love the way your cock feels when it's hard inside me. My pussy is so wet. I love being with it. I love being with you. It's perfect. I'm being fucked in every hole. I'm having another orgasm.</p> <p>Our fucking gets faster, our bodies hitting a rhythm together. You're sliding in and out of my wet pussy with each thrust. Your balls are slapping against my clit every time. I'm so hot.</p> <p>I'm moaning loudly with yours in my mouth. I'm having another orgasm.</p> <p>"I love you so much," you say in my ear. I can hear your voice. You love the feel of mine in your hands. I hear you moaning with mine.</p> <p>"I love you too. I love fucking you like this. "</p> <p>I hear your words, your hands sliding up and down my back.</p> <p>"Your pussy feels so good with me inside you," you say to me. "I love the way my cock feels," as you move back and forth. I can feel the head of your cock rubbing my clit. I feel your hands move from my back down to my ass. I love having your hands on me.</p> <p>We've got to get back to my room. "What room are you in? " I say as we get up off the couch. "Bedroom," you say to me with a smile on your face. I move the couch to the edge of the room. You're now on your back on my bed. "Get the vibrator and turn the television on. Make yourself cum," you say to me.</p> <p>I turn the vibrator on and turn it on high. I can't believe that it feels good. I turn it on long enough to feel your hands moving down my body. "I think I'm going to cum again" I say out to you. You're making out with me again as I'm trying to hold myself off.</p> <p>"I'm not finished yet," your hands cup my breasts and roll my nipples up. "You're going to give me another orgasm, sweetie. " I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out. I'm getting so close to cumming again." You're still kissing me. You know I'm going to cum. I can feel your cock swelling inside me. I grab your butt and pull you up towards me. I feel you grab my hips and pull me into you hard. You're pounding me deep and fast. You know I'm going to cum a second time. I can't hold on any harder. I want you to cum inside me. We go into a powerful orgasm while we're kissing.</p> <p>Oh my God I keep repeating that phrase ever time I heard it. I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming. I can feel your cock swelling as you pull me into you. We hold each other for what feels like eternity, but really is just a few seconds.</p> <p>As I lay in your arms, I'm trying to catch my breath. "My God. It was amazing," I say at you.</p> <p>We kiss again as your fingers trace my nipples. They were all that was held captive there in the world. I reach down to feel your hardness, which is still in me. You're telling me how good that was.</p> <p>"I think I'm ready to move on your floor again," you say to me.</p> <p>"Let's go," I whisper in your ear. You pull the vibrator away as you kiss me the way I have longed for forever.</p> <p>As we start to get dressed, I can't help but think, "I can't believe I just had the best sex I ever had in my life."</p> <p>After we shower and dress, I kiss you and you grab my hand and lead me out to the car. You stop before you open the car door.</p> <p>"Let me get your shoes and socks," you say to me as you go back to your room to get your clothes.</p> <p>I come over and sitâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
