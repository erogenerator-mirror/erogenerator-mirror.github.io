I said.</p> <p>"That's all I needed to say," was the answer.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>I went to the office that Thursday night and told my boss at the time I had a business meeting that day, and that I had to go. I had a quickie and was heading home to get ready, and before dinner, I was thinking that I could keep going the rest of the week just by working at the library.</p> <p>At around nine-thirty, I left the library and headed out to the motel, arriving there after about an hour. I checked in and checked out. I looked at the room number on the key, and a little worried what my boss might think if he'd come in and saw me. It was a good job and it went down well.</p> <p>The desk clerk was a cute Hispanic guy. I had a suspicion that he looked a bit more mature and sophisticated than his older boss. I also found out later he knew my job history. He said I was the manager of the library. I gave him my name and told him I had an appointment the day before. He smiled and nodded politely before giving me the key. I left a fifty for him and headed down to the car. I got in the car and began thinking about my life as I drove away. I still felt like what I was doing wasn't right, but I couldn't see myself going back.</p> <p>By eleven o'clock that evening, I was feeling good and horny. By four-thirty I was sitting at home, listening to the radio quietly. I knew I wouldn't be able to get through the evening without making love, so I thought I'd take one. By five o'clock I was in bed, and I could hear the radio starting up, but there was no one home yet yet, so I started feeling more adventurous than I'd been up until that point. I got up, stripped off my clothes and got into bed. I reached for my cock with one hand and started stroking it gently, and then I put two fingers into my pussy and used my middle finger to caress my clit before sliding the fingers back inside. I was in heaven. After a few moments I felt my pussy become wet. It's been so long! I wanted to be fucked so bad, but I didn't. Finally, I felt a finger go into my ass hole, and my body went up with the shock of the intrusion. It wasn't a finger, it was my vibrator, and a second and third finger went into my cunt and I was going wild! I went straight for my orgasm from the feelings coursing through my body. Finally I was done, and drifted off to sleep.</p> <p>But I was still thinking more than I had thought, until I realized that my neighbor David was home. He was in the shower. I thought about that for a few minutes and then I got out of bed. I was sure he'd be out a bit before it was time for me to go to work. I went into my room, grabbed a night robe, and headed down the stairs. When I got there, there was a note on the door. It said "Call me, I hope you've had fun today." When I got to the door and looked in at the note again, I saw it was from David. I wondered what it was for.</p> <p>"David", it read, and you can stop by anytime. I hope you have had fun today.</p> <p>I just stared at the phone for a few moments, then decided to say good bye. I turned the phone off and went down to my car and drove away. It had been a long and very bad day. When I got back to my place, I turned off the lights, went inside, got one more beer from the fridge, sat on my bed and waited. It was just after nine-thirty when I heard the sound of a car, so I decided to go back to the motel and check in a minute. It was almost nine now. I got one more beer, and then got dressed. At nine o'clock I saw a light come on in the room, and I knocked and entered the room to see David lying on the bed. I was so surprised I jumped straight through the light. It was one of the older rooms, and David was lying on his back. I was shocked but didn't move.</p> <p>"Hi," I said, finally, with barely an inch between us and I could see his eyes, "How are you?"</p> <p>"I'm okay", David said, "I can't believe I just did that, and it was good."</p> <p>"Me too, David" I said, "But I'm okay."</p> <p>"I've got to tell someone," he said.
