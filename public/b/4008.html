"You're so smooth. So soft." There was no mistaking the passion with which she spoke. She cupped her right breast, massaging it, caressing and lifting it and her nipple. Suddenly, she moved her hand to the other one and she took the nipple between her lips and sucked it, pulling at it gently, as her hips undulated underneath her as they had at the first time her mouth had touched her.</p> <p>Suddenly she pulled away. "No, don't," she whispered. "I've never done one of those before."</p> <p>"But I didn't really understand anything at the time," Jenny told her as she looked into her eyes. "You can do the same to yourself."</p> <p>"No," Jen begged. "No, let me." She lay flat on her back beside Jennifer. Jen was on one side and was kissing her neck. While Jenny was giving her breasts, both women had their arms around her, enjoying the feeling of a breast in both hands. They had been doing that, and neither of them had said a word since.</p> <p>"I was beginning to get nervous," Jen told her. "It felt really good -- really tight. Not like when you did your finger in my bottom. I'm not used to doing anal. But that felt really good too."</p> <p>"That's the main thing," Jennifer told her, rubbing Jen's arms and shoulders. "Making you do things that you think you'd like to do to yourself. I like to do things while you're doing 'that'. There's a lot of that there. It's very relaxing and enjoyable.</p> <p>"If you're okay with me doing something like that to you, then, I don't see why it's such a drag."</p> <p>Jen gave a little smile. "If it's okay with you, then, I don't object." She closed her eyes. "It's just so soft."</p> <p>"Okay?"</p> <p>There was a long, quiet moment where Jenny felt the tension of what she had already felt with the other woman, and was now feeling as it was with Jen, feeling the anticipation for what the other would do next.</p> <p>"I was wondering if you would like me to do anything like that," Jen whispered. "It would make you feel better. What could you like?"</p> <p>"Oh, I think I'd like that," Jen murmured, lying down beside her. Her hands caressed Jen's face, caressed her neck, and massaged her hair.</p> <p>"How about me making you feel good?" Jenny suggested. "Would you like that?"</p> <p>Jen shrugged. "Sure, if that's what you have in mind." With that question, Jenny lifted Jennifer's left leg, and positioned herself between it and her own. Then, she brought her lips to Jen's and gently kissed her, moving her own lips around in a sensuous kiss as her hips rose to meet the caress there, enjoying the sensation. Jen, still on one side, pressed herself against her, trying to get the movement of her breasts and hips on top of the other woman's body, feeling her breasts and nipples move against the other woman's. She moved her hips against Jenny's and they both got the same sensation as Jennifer. When Jen moved her hips against her, Jenny did the same, and then they moved closer.</p> <p>Soon, they were kissing, moaning together, making love, and exploring each other's body. Jen, who, like Jenn, was an experienced lover in those areas, liked to explore and enjoy a woman in other ways.</p> <p>At the point where Jenny's lips went into a different position, Jenny rolled on top of Jen. Her lips parted with a kiss as she began rubbing Jen with her lower body. Jenny didn't mind it at all, and, if she was feeling good, she allowed herself to be teased by it. And then, it was gone.</p> <p>When Jenny's leg came up, and Jennifer moved inside her, the contact got much more intense. Their eyes met, and Jenny looked into Jenny's eyes and saw the passion there. Jenny held Jen firmly, and let her hands roam all over Jenny's body, feeling all her bones and ligaments, feeling the muscles and bone beneath her hands. Jenny put her arms around Jen's neck, and they kissed once more, enjoying the sensation of being one.</p> <p>It was then that Jen pulled away. "Wait," she said. "Let me turnover."</p> <p>Jen lay down alongside Jenny, feeling the full weight of her body, feeling her breasts, her butt, and her hands touching and caressing every part of her. Then, as if she were on a roller coaster, she rolled slowly onto her back and let the sheet fall away from her body.
