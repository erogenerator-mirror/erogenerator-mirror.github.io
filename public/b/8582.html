She was shaking... and her ass looked so good... he felt himself starting to throb.</p> <p>"M...mommy!" he yelped... "Please, noooo... I can't..."</p> <p>Then he felt his jeans being ripped apart and heard the loud rip-scene of his boxers being ripped of as well as her cries, followed by the thunking-foom of a rubber band sliding onto his shaft. Her moans grew louder, and she felt him pulsing inside her... she couldn't fight it too hard. Then she felt a moment after, his eyes close, and she knew he was cumming.</p> <p>Then he pulled out... and the air became thick with the scent of their lovemaking, and the next thing he did felt good, so good as she lay with her leg thrown over him on the couch, his cock still between her legs. It took a few moments for everything to settle down... and she couldn't remember how long... it felt like hours. But as his cock softened, it got hard inside of her... and she could feel it slowly pushing back at her... and it kept going in... deep... and then getting harder... and then getting harder... and then it got bigger... and bigger inside her... and then it was in her ass again... and she knew it was his sperm that was pumping deep within her... and when he finished, she felt his cum ooze out, and down, and on her ass... and it felt good... so hot... so soft.</p> <p>She leaned sideways to him and they laid there in each other's arms for a few moments. "I'm sorry you had to leave, Jack... I didn't mean to do it... I can't say... I'll be back... a moment."</p> <p>And when he returned, his arms went around her, and they kissed again, this time long, deep, and slow. And when he finished, he slid himself out, and she lay down next to him, still in her jeans, and they held each other, and kissed again. And she felt him get hard again in her ass... he was feeling good... so good... so good. She pulled herself up and took him in her mouth and started sucking on him again... and all thought went out of her mind.</p> <p>"Oh God," she thought... I can't let this go... and she started fucking his cock again... and she couldn't stop it, but it just made her cum again, all over his throbbing shaft... and a few minutes later, the two of them got up, and went into the kitchen to start the food.</p> <p>Once they were finished, they went to the bedroom and she laid down on the bed, and turned on the lights, and they heard some noises coming from the den... and then he came back with a large blanket wrapped around him... and they were all naked... and as he laid his naked head back on one shoulder, she turned over and kissed him the same way she had always done on all of her lovers... that way... she felt love pouring into her again. And when they were ready to start the bedroom again... she kissed him again... and she knew this was going to take a long time.</p> <p>So she got up, and as they laid down in the bed with their arms around each other at least, she said. "You know... this would be a fantastic threesome..."</p> <p>"Oh yeah," he said, "I sure wouldn't mind. I mean, would you want to be with me?" And she didn't mind... it felt wonderful to see him feel so strong, so dominant and forceful while she was at the mercy of his will, and she could never hope to see him so happy again... she loved it. Plus, she liked the feeling of having a strong loving man at her side again.</p> <p>"You know, Jack..." she started, "if this works out, maybe I will feel better about it... I guess it feels good to have someone you love feeling good... but I know that feeling is still part of being in love with me."</p> <p>"Well..." he said smiling, "as long as we feel good, then that's fair... I think I'd be happy with just a threesome..."</p> <p>"You're right," she said... "you are really a wonderful lover..."</p> <p>"And you're really sweet..." he said softly,</p> <p>"And... and beautiful..."</p> <p>And then she kissed him... and they began making the bed again... and they knew that they were going to become good friends... and that they'd do everythingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
