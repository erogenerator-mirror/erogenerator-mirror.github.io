He wanted me to quit playing around. I never could and never would. He had to know me before I had to take my mind from him. All the things I wanted to do with someone else and he never did any of them. He wasn't that bad of a father and that I was sorry for and wanted to fix. My own feelings and feelings for him have always been a dark and painful truth for me.</p> <p>I have never loved him. It was more the fact that my own feelings of hatred, hurt, bitterness over what I did for my father have hurt so much I couldn't explain.</p> <p>I don't know why I did it so suddenly. It is what I felt when I was young. I went to school and worked, I went and I became a soldier. My father, being the most important person in my life, just gave me this gift. I was so proud to have the kind of life I wanted. I felt that I owed my mom for everything her and Dad had done for their kids.</p> <p>I think at the time I realized that just because he gave up all we had to offer me. He could say those things to her but he couldn't do that to our friends. And he was just too much like my father, too strong and mean for that kind of hurt.</p> <p>"That was your dad, mom. My dad was just a little too young to be taking responsibility for us if things got that bad. "</p> <p>At that point I don't know if we did it for old or not. All I know is that for over a year I watched my father and my friends all grown up. I knew then as soon as I knew that, that they must have been very young. That my parents, and my mother, had been bad to them.</p> <p>I was so proud of my parents and how they would always protect us and help us when we got hurt. But now all we had to do was get through it and then they'd leave. I guess by then I had thought I was being put in a terrible position and thought that maybe, just maybe, they'd take over. I don't know but what I can't fathom is why I did it.</p> <p>It is what I would have done if the parents at the time I did the same thing I did. I knew they would not treat me so negatively if we had just been young kids. And if they'd just let me try, I could see what else they could teach me. They'd both be proud of me. When the kids got their first lesson in self esteem, you can't tell. Then you have to get to work with them."</p> <p>He still held the same thing in his eyes that would make any other man look guilty. I think I have to say I was grateful then. The feeling at that moment was better than I have ever feltâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
