I took in what I could and gave it a test.</p> <p>"I'm not sure I should go down on you..." I said.</p> <p>"Do it, Jack. If you get me pregnant, I will stop."</p> <p>I took my shirt off and stepped out of it, my cock still at attention.</p> <p>"No. Not yet. I want you. Not right now, but soon. I've wanted to do this for a long time..."</p> <p>I was shocked by this statement and looked at her questioningly.</p> <p>"Are you sure? Do you really want me? After what happened to us?"</p> <p>"I'm sure. I feel like we have just met, and haven't really..."</p> <p>"What happened?" she asked, now touching my shaft, almost tentatively, her lips softly kissing the head.</p> <p>"Well, let's keep that to ourselves. I don't think you are ready, just yet."</p> <p>She didn't need any more coaxing. I helped her up, and stood her up, then took a condom out as well. I laid back on the bed and spread her legs, putting them over each arm of the bed.</p> <p>She held herself to me, and then started slowly rocking back and forth, up and down, sliding my cock in and out. This was different than the fucking you get after sex, where they move your mind, your body, your sexual being. It felt so good.</p> <p>She was panting like crazy. I looked down at my cock, so engorged, her labia clinging to me, her nipples hard against the bed, I could feel them in my cheek. I closed my eyes, savoring the feeling of her body, the smell of her, her taste.</p> <p>Then I felt her body shaking, her breathing quicken. It took a moment to register how good this was to her, and then she climaxed, hard.</p> <p>"Oh, god! I'm coming!" she moaned. I was right behind her, my cock buried to the hilt inside her, holding it tight for her, as she climaxed. My own body shook as she came, and as I did that, I came.</p> <p>We lay together, until I softened a little. Then I got up to my own bed. I lay between her legs and kissed her gently, then ran my fingers through her hair and around her nipples. She had a sweet look in her eyes, and I kissed them, slowly, tenderly, my hand on her breast. Then I slid back on the bed.</p> <p>I kissed her for a while, and she opened her mouth, wanting me, opening her legs, her pussy. I started slowly at first, stroking her, working the inside of her lips with my thumb, her clit against my thumb again.</p> <p>We moved slowly, like lovers, exploring each other's bodies. I felt her body shudder as my thumb grazed her clit, and I could feel her orgasm starting, but she didn't need that. Her body was alive, alive to the point of convulsions, her body trembling all over and shaking so hard that it looked like she might break.</p> <p>Finally she recovered from her orgasm.</p> <p>"Do you want me to fuck you some more?"</p> <p>"Oh yes. Fuck me some more right now. I need you to fuck me some more"</p> <p>With her words of encouragement, I moved myself over her, sliding my cock into her, still inside the condom, but not pulling out. Her legs parted, and I slid deeply into her again, holding it in, feeling her pulse against me.</p> <p>I lay on her, kissing her, rubbing her shoulders and back, her breasts, her neck, my chest. With every kiss I'd get, I'd make sure I would drive my own cock further in her than mine ever had before.</p> <p>And then I started, slow at first, feeling her body, feel the trembling, her body responding, responding to me. First we just touched each other, I'd move my hands all over her shoulders, her back, her face, our mouths, both of us. Then it was long before she went to her own, and we kissed, our tongues swirling about each other as well.</p> <p>She lay back, and took my hand between us, guiding it down to where the shaft of my cock still throbbed inside her.</p> <p>"Lift your leg, please."</p> <p>She rolled over and lifted her knee up, giving me easier access. Then she lay flat on the bed. She didn't need to say anything, just spread her legs wide. I got on the bed, straddling her, my cock buried in her, and began moving my cock in and out, slowly, watching her bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
