"Let me, please?"</p> <p>"OK," I said, taking a deep, calming breath. "So much so that you're all I can do to keep from bursting at the seams." He was leaning forward, eyes closed, and I was almost ready to collapse on the bed, but then...</p> <p>I felt my pulse fluttering down to the very base. "I can't, honey."</p> <p>"Do you know exactly what I'll do?" he asked, his voice very deep.</p> <p>"What?" I said, looking up at him.</p> <p>"I'll start it off, slowly," he said, still stroking gently at my sex.</p> <p>"Oh..."</p> <p>He slid two of his forefingers slowly up inside me. I let out a sound like a sigh, and then he started pushing, pushing inside me, pushing his fingers all the way inside me. With slow, steady pressure, he slid them all the way out, and then slid them along my vaginal walls to the tip of his cock.</p> <p>I leaned against the pillows.</p> <p>"Oh god..." he said, in a low, husky voice. "It feels so good."</p> <p>I just lay back and let him do this. All I wanted to do was sit up a little, let him do this to me forever. And the closer he got to doing this, the closer I got, the closer I got. I was on my hands and knees again, and I could feel his hardness up my butt, right where he was and how it was all I wanted to feel.</p> <p>And what he did next, I didn't know at first.</p> <p>I felt him shift, and then he pushed himself just an inch away from where I was.</p> <p>"Are you ready for me?" he whispered to me.</p> <p>"Yes," I breathed.</p> <p>I felt him slide his dick into me, and I closed my eyes, just a little. He pushed forward a little, and then felt the tip of his cock spread me open, and then all of his length was inside me, and I felt a wave of pleasure wash over me.</p> <p>He started thrusting, and I took up the rhythm again. And again.</p> <p>And again.</p> <p>"Are you still ready for this, sweetie?" he whispered, and when I looked down at him, his chest was rising and falling heavily.</p> <p>"Yesssssss," I cried, almost sobbing. "Oh my god..."</p> <p>Then he started pumping. I could feel him sliding into my body, deep, deep inside me, going on and off, and I felt him inside me, filling me up.</p> <p>I reached my hand down and started rubbing my clit, and when he started pumping, I thought I'd start cumming right then, even without touching myself. But it wasn't, it just felt like, well, I was all ready, a hundred miles away.</p> <p>"I'm gonna come, sweetie," I whispered and I tried to reach out to grab his dick with my hand, but he shook it off, and I was still rubbing my clit.</p> <p>"Where?" he whispered, just above me.</p> <p>"Here," I gasped and he came in my mouth. As soon as it entered my mouth, it set me off. I started squirting my own juices on him, and then he was out of me and leaning against me, still inside me. He was still on all fours, and I could see his cum oozing out my pussy, mixing with mine. I leaned back a little, just letting him do it.</p> <p>I looked up. I hadn't moved. He was leaning against me, but it looked a little odd. But as soon as I made eye contact with him, he turned to look over his shoulder at me and give me that same deep smile that I'd caught just before our first intense moment. I felt like I was on the edge of bursting, and then, suddenly, his body was moving with me, and I was sliding all the way up his dick now, the tip of his cock sliding under it, all the way up his shaft, to his balls, and then back down again, and finally all the way off again, down to his scrotum, over and over, and back up to the tip again, then all the way up his dick, and then...</p> <p>"Hush, sweetheart," I whispered, and he just nodded, his hand on my shoulder as we stared at each other. His face was still a little red, and it didn't look like he was going to be able to speak, but it didn't have anything to do with the fact that I was watching him.</p> <p>"What was that?" he murmured as he strokedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
