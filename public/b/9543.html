She decided to just be a spectator and allow her boyfriend of the next two weeks to watch.” I mean after we all go to the beach tomorrow, how does that compare?”</p> <p>Just then he began to walk towards the shore. She watched him pull his shirt over his head and stand next to him and say hi. She quickly jumped around in place, making sure no one else was even out of the water. When the door opened she took a quick glance between the two of them for any sign of anyone. They were walking slowly along the shoreline, talking lightly behind one ear and smiling. All in fun with no one around them. She decided to stay close. She wanted to be close to him, he had to know that, and they could be friends in public view. She wondered how far it should have gone, or what he would think, and how he would feel about it. She knew it would be safe. She wanted him to know that she had trusted him and would never betray the trust. She looked him straight in the eye and said,</p> <p>“Let’s go back to the room.” With that they got into their separate vehicles and started to drive off back to the hotel. They had made the short journey without incident, as they had known each other for a while already. She turned on the GPS on the wall in her bag and quickly called her girlfriend and told her they had been able to reach a hotel within miles. She told them the rooms were on the second floor and that her boyfriend was on his way down to the beach. She told the directions into the GPS and then she took a quick look through her phone before she dialed her boyfriend in the room.</p> <p>They quickly arrived after a quick shower and breakfast before leaving the gym. They sat on the sofa having a sandwich. He told her how excited it made him to know that she had agreed and be coming along to meet him in Atlantic City. He then proceeded to tell her of how his and his brother had decided to split up after they had come back from a long plane trip to see Florida. A little of the story had come out on a whim, but he told her that even the idea would never happen. He said it was because his brother felt guilty because the other one hadn’t been the subject of their conversation back home. “He just loves to tell it from the source!” he added. “It’s like he’s trying to justify what he is doing to people. I don’t think he knew about it, but I think he would have told us that by now.”</p> <p>As he continued they sat around the table drinking their coffee and eating their lunch. He told her on the phone how they had planned to go out to the beach tomorrow. He told her it was planned that they would stay on the island for the weekend and the next day and that his brother and his uncle would be over for dinner and he wouldn’t see them. He said it couldn’t be said that the last thing he wanted to do was to have to stay in the Bahamas and have his brother watch them. She had to agree. He asked if he could come over to their house the next day and be a guest. She told him it would be fine and she had a plan that she knew would work perfectly.</p> <p>He told her that they had to do something that night. He had a great idea and that he would be the perfect hostess—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
