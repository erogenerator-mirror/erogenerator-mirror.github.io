When our tongues met I felt it was a soft feather touch, then went with it in a soft moan. We parted our lips and licked our lips. The smell of perfume started wafting her way, making me weak in the knees. I couldn't hold myself up any longer.</p> <p>The heat of her breast against my chest made me moan. I gently squeezed her tit, trying to get her nipple inside my hand. Her body began shiver and she pulled away. A look of surprise covered her face, but she didn't say a word.</p> <p>She grabbed the back of my head, put me down with no more of a sound then she kissed me harder. I could barely breathe, gasping for air, then she broke away, pulled away, looking at me.</p> <p>"I've wanted your body for so long I can't get it out of my system."</p> <p>I looked at the top of her head trying to figure out what she thought of me, but there was no response. Finally she gave me a smile, turned her body toward me and started to undress herself.</p> <p>When she was completely nude, I got my wish. There was a beautiful woman in front of me, body as beautiful as my own. Her lips glistened, her nipples firm, her hands roaming over my body. She started to rub her breasts against my skin, nipples already hard. I had never felt that feeling before.</p> <p>I couldn't take it anymore, I dove for her. I ran my hands around her body, her skin was soft to my touch. Then I started kissing her, my tongue licking her lips. Our tongues entangled, kissing. She tasted like wine and she smelled so sweet, like the wine she was now all over my body.</p> <p>I couldn't resist anymore, I kissed her neck moving my hand slowly down, stopping at her breasts. I took a nipple in my mouth, feeling it's hard texture. After all the other girls had given I didn't know how good they were. I kissed lower towards her navel, down over her hips, then stopped in front of something which she was wearing.</p> <p>I looked back at her body looking at my hair, wondering why I hadn't done this before. I don't know what made me decide to do this. I don't know what made me stop. I was really into this new woman. I couldn't wait anymore, I wanted to taste her, kiss her, lick her. I wanted to feel her body. I could imagine it against my lips.</p> <p>I got on my knees with my hands on her thigh, still kissing her soft lips. I moved my fingers up to her breasts, gently fondling them, feeling them as they got harder and harder. I started sucking them, making my wet mouth feel every inch, rubbing them, making it's movements as hard as it is when you rub yourself.</p> <p>Then I moved my eyes back to her body to take in what I was doing, I moved down her abdomen, slowly and deliberately with my face and hands. I moved closer to her pussy. I could see the beautiful pussy of her. It was already slick and smooth and tasted just like when you like wine, a bit like the wine I had in my body tasted so good. It was red and smelled so clean.</p> <p>I took it in my mouth, gently taking in her scent and taste. I could feel the warmth of my saliva on my fingers making her a little wetter and wetter.</p> <p>I had my head to the side of hers, slowly moving down to touch her pussy lip, then moving my way up towards her clit, my tongue licking it slowly at first. After all the other girls were licking me I had never had such a sensual woman. I was like an animal making every move I made with her. I started to give her some pleasure in my mouth then and every now and then I could hear her moan, a little louder.</p> <p>Suddenly I felt a finger touch something.</p> <p>"Oh." Then her voice stopped for a moment, "Oh my god, did I just do that?" her face was still trying to get an answer. I didn't say anything either, I just kept on kissing her face, and gently nibbling her ears.</p> <p>After several moments she got her thoughts back and started breathing a bit faster. Her hands touched my shoulder and she slowly started to rub my arm, my shoulder.</p> <p>"Oh, you know how to do it, don't stop."</p> <p>I didn't even hear her say the words, "make me cum again." Then I saw her body tightening up. She started moaning loudly and I knew the next words would be "make me cumâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
