Without meaning to or having any idea, he lowered his lips to hers, brushing his lips over hers and sucking lightly with his tongue. He felt her press back against him, pressing herself against him, breathing into his ear. Taking advantage of the moment, he reached up and gently pulled at her dark brown hair. He pulled from her lips with a smile to meet her eyes again and she melted in his gaze. He released her lips and smiled, turning to look at her. Her lips were full and soft and slightly parted. He wanted to explore her lips with his tongue and he looked into her eyes again, meeting her gaze again and taking her hand. He brought her to him and she felt him press against her stomach. She felt the hardness of his penis as it pressed into her belly. She could feel his breath hot on her face and he brought his lips up to her cheek, kissing her on her cheek then her ear. She took his head in both of her hands and pulled him in to her ear.</p> <p>"You do know what you're doing, don't you?" She replied.</p> <p>"Yes," Gino responded.</p> <p>"And you care for me so much."</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>Gino brought his lips to her ear and softly licked her ear with his tongue. He felt her shift beneath him and the kiss deepened. He felt the heat of her body as she moved closer, pressing into him and feeling his erection. He kissed her neck and kissed her chin and her throat. He kissed and nibbled on her collar bone and he felt her body begin to move in response. Gino moved his hands to her hips and felt her shiver slightly. He felt her body stiffen slightly, not quite fully in the grip of her excitement and he knew that she was close. He stopped kissing her neck and his lips moved down her chest. He brushed kisses across her skin and felt the goose bumps rise slightly. He traced her stomach with his tongue and then lifted his head slightly. He looked her in the eyes and saw that she was looking back at him, her eyes moving from his mouth to his face. He moved up to her and put a hand to the small of her back. He turned her around for him and he began to kiss the base of her neck, nuzzling it slightly before moving to her collar bones and then to her chin.</p> <p>"You look beautiful," he whispered before returning back to her lips.</p> <p>"Thank you." Gino moved back to her, kissing her lips again before taking her hand and helping her stand.</p> <p>Gino sat her down on the bed and put her into the couch. He pulled the blankets up and stood behind her. He took her hands and held them while he pulled a sheet over them. He took his own shirt and lay it over hers, pulling it up and over. Her fingers moved to his chest as she laid her hands on him, massaging along his chest.</p> <p>"What?" Gino asked as she took his hands in hers.</p> <p>"Just watch me."</p> <p>Gino watched her as she closed her eyes. He could have let his heart carry over onto hers if he hadn't already gone into a frenzy. He wanted her so badly but he wanted her like a man wanted a woman. Gino turned to her and kissed her again, his tongue seeking hers. Gino moved his hands to the sides of her hips as he kissed. He could smell her scent as he leaned forward.</p> <p>"This is what happens to lovers," he whispered.</p> <p>Gino lifted her legs up so they were touching the top of the couch. He held his arms up so he could kneel her without having to bend over. He kissed her ankle as he moved closer to her. He kissed her ankle and began licking the sole of her foot, slowly moving back up her leg to her knee. He nibbled at her foot as he lifted it to his lips. Gino licked her shoe as he removed it. Gino watched his face as he sucked her toe and felt her hand behind his head. Gino pulled on his ears.</p> <p>"You like that?"</p> <p>"It's....un-fucking-believable!"</p> <p>"Yes it is."</p> <p>His tongue was working its way down her leg to her knee. Teasing her. Kissing his way up her calf and to her thigh. He lifted first one leg and then the other to move between his teeth. He ran his hand behind his head. He raised the back of his neck to gaze at her. He pulled his hair around his finger tips as he kissed his way down her leg, finally reaching her body. He looked up, into the eyes of his lover as he moved to her and kissed her lips and lips. He could see in her eyes that she was completely in his power.</p> <p>"Are you sureâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
