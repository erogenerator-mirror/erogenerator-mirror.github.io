What did you want to see?" he asked.</p> <p>"I want to kiss you," she said and quickly leaned in as he reached over and kissed her. His lips were soft. She had not felt this way before. He kissed her cheek quickly and then moved to her neck. Then down the side of it and gently kissed her breast. He began to suck on it very gently; she shivered. When they moved to the other breast he kissed her and again his lips were soft. She let out a soft moan. She was so turned on that she could not stop herself. His hand gently rubbed her leg. She began to slowly rise and fall. Her breathing was so uneven that she was worried that someone may see the passion in her eyes. It wasn't very long before she reached the point where she wanted to explode in an intense orgasm, and then he stopped.</p> <p>"Don't you dare," she said. He smiled and said, "I want to make your climax last forever, so I don't have to worry how hard you get it." His hand gently massaged her breast and then he moved to her face. "Please kiss me again, sweetheart," she begged. He slowly kissed her way down her neck. His lips went to hers and she kissed him back as hard as he had kissed her. His lips were hot. He pulled her close and her breasts pressed to his chest. As they kissed he pulled his hands back from her breasts.</p> <p>"Why are you doing this?" she asked. He said nothing. She had to admit that he was hot. He took his hand away from her back and slowly moved her dress up and off. She could feel his hot skin against her back as he peeled her dress off her body. As he kissed her breasts and sucked on her nipples, her body convulsed a little more. She knew that she was going to climax again very soon and as he suckled on her nipples that he moved further down her body. It had been so long since she had felt him in her that she did not have long to wait. When his mouth came to her vagina, she reached down as if under the dress in an attempt to touch him again. He removed her hands and kissed her as she continued to gasp. As he moved down her stomach, she shivered. Her mouth opened for air as she breathed him in again. He began to kiss her thighs and her inner lips. He had been doing this for so long, that he knew just how sensitive they were. "What are you thinking, sweetheart?" he asked. She was not sure but it made her smile.</p> <p>"I-I'm just wondering if I'm ever going to make it," she answered.</p> <p>"Well, we have waited long enough," he answered. "It is now or never. Now is a perfect time to be with you. It is what we both want." He put his middle finger in her vagina and began to move it in little circles. "You can do what you need to make it last," he assured her. He put his finger into her bottom as he kissed her again. His lips were moving on hers as his body pressed to it. They moaned as they felt each other's body. He began to run the tip of his tongue over her lips. She parted her lips and let out a moan as her tongue touched his. She wanted to scream and tell him to go slow. As he kissed her, his finger pushed into her vagina as he rubbed the roof of her vagina. She lifted her hips into him as he rubbed her insides.</p> <p>His finger was moving in and out slowly, very slow. She felt it slowly slip in as it circled her vagina. His finger was long and he slowly moved it in out then back in very very slowly. They both moaned as he used her vagina to bring forth and release more ejaculation. He pushed three fingers in very carefully. When she felt his hand move in and out very, very very slowly over her clitoris, she had to close her eyes and moan. He did the same to her vagina. The sensation was not as bad as it had been with her, but it was not as good. Her climax, when it happened, was as intense as a nuclear blast.</p> <p>"Now that was good, did you like it?" he asked. It had been such a while, that she didn't think she could make it again. After she got over the first climax, she wanted her second and last time. She began to lift her hips up and down. Then he slipped his finger from her vagina and slowly, slowly, he began to push all of it into her. His hand moved to her breasts. She moved her hips with his hand and she was getting closer to ecstasy. After a long time, she felt him begin to move his fingers in and outâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
