The first one I will grant you, is sexual gratification, you will call it an orgasm. Is that clear?"</p> <p>"Yeah but...you're making me feel like a slut?"</p> <p>"Yes. We're both adults." He said, reaching across the desk. Taking his hand, he began to rub.</p> <p>"Do you like it?" He asked. "My hand feels good around you." "I like it...It's...I like it..." she stammered.</p> <p>"Good," he said, rubbing her breasts through her blouse. "You're going to make that very special. I have all my toys, and the one on top of that is my vibrator. I hope you don't mind. The second one I will grant you; you will call it an orgasm."</p> <p>She bit her lip in anticipation, and was thankful that he was not trying to seduce her. As she leaned toward him for a kiss he grabbed her right ass cheek, and kissed her. She felt herself wanting a second one, with her lips there, to kiss the man she loved. Before the night was over she would have given him his wish, she would have given in...if only they weren't two men; two men who thought they could please her...</p> <p>"Ohh," she moaned after the kiss, when he stood back. "You're a bad man."</p> <p>"I'm not bad..." he said, standing in front of her. Looking into her eyes, she saw that he was smiling as he undid his shirt and tossed it off to reveal a nice broad chest. His hands were caressing her exposed flesh. His tongue licked her ear before she whispered...</p> <p>"What are you going to do?" she wondered.</p> <p>"Don't worry...we'll get to that." He chuckled. "Do you have a name?"</p> <p>"Nope." She laughed, and blushed at the way she had made a noise when talking so dirty to herself. "I'm a slut..."</p> <p>"You are?"</p> <p>"Yeah," she answered, giving one last glance at him as she walked toward him. "You won't tell anyone."</p> <p>"Nope." He said with a laugh. "I've already marked you; you'll have to wait until you're out of here." He held out his hand. "Take off your dress, baby."</p> <p>Her hands trembled. She felt her face flush, and her heart beat hard as she did what he asked. In seconds she was on her knees before him. He pulled aside her skirt, and let it fall to the floor. She knelt, naked under her bra and panties, waiting for the man she loved. She heard a soft moan, as he walked behind her to unhook his belt, and then pull out his large cock. She licked her lips, and looked back into the eyes.</p> <p>"That's where you belong," he said, standing before her. His hands stroked her face, her neck, and moved up to squeeze her breasts. He lifted her to her feet, turned her body towards him, and slowly removed her panties; exposing her pussy to his hungry eyes.</p> <p>His warm hand slid down over her abdomen to her wetness, and she felt her body tremble. He took her hand and brought it to his mouth, licked it, and then kissed it. "You want to taste me?" he asked, in his deep voice.</p> <p>"Yes, Sir," she answered.</p> <p>"Oh yes, you want to." He said. "We've been waiting for some time."</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>He grabbed her hand, laid her back down on the desk, and then straddled her so he could watch her as she continued to lick and suck his cock. She reached between her legs, rubbed her clit, and made herself cum quickly, with a scream of delight. They rested for several minutes, their bodies trembling a bit, before he began to slowly remove the blindfold from her eyes.</p> <p>"Ohh," she said as she blinked some tears from them. "I can't believe we're doing this."</p> <p>"It's okay baby," he said, looking her as he did the same. "It's what we each wanted. It's about sharing."</p> <p>She smiled, and pulled him closer to her. He kissed her mouth, then down to her neck and then her breasts. Her pussy responded to his touch, by soaking him. He took one small nipple between her warm fingers, and then began to rub all around it. After a minute he asked, "Are you ready for your favorite toy to be inside of you? It's so big, baby."</p> <p>"I hope so."
