"But it could be difficult for both of us."</p> <p>"It was nice to meet you, Ms. Ritter," he replied as he turned and locked the door behind him.</p> <p>Gwen slowly turned to look into his face and could only smile and shake her head in a small 'no'.</p> <p>"I have something for you there, Mr. Miller," Tasha told her friend before leading her back out to the limousine behind the bar.</p> <p>When the door closed behind them, the waitress arrived to set the table for them. They ordered their drinks and Tasha looked at Gwen.</p> <p>"I hope they get you drinks, but I'm not sure how much."</p> <p>Gwen smiled and sat silently while Tasha poured them each a glass.</p> <p>"Just because you're going to tell me all about your sex days," Gwen smiled at the stranger while her glass was drained. "And I am sure I'm going to need all of mine."</p> <p>Tasha smiled and set the empty glass across the table to one side.</p> <p>"I'm glad we're here, Ms. Ritter. We're waiting."</p> <p>"Well, I can feel my panties getting wet," Gwen purred, placing her hand on Tasha's thigh. "And you don't mind, do you?"</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>The older waitress returned with their drinks, smiling brightly when she saw the look of concern on Gwen's face.</p> <p>"Tasha would you like another glass of wine please?"</p> <p>"Please, Ms. Ritter," Gwen continued, not bothering to wait for a response, "This will make all the difference if I get another drink. Besides, I really don't want to wait any longer."</p> <p>"That's fine," Tasha purred. "But I'm thirsty too."</p> <p>Gwen laughed and poured them another glass.</p> <p>"Here's to going home after I have all that wine. And to being able to walk on that beautiful body of yours in every direction."</p> <p>"I'm glad we got all of that," Tasha smiled at the waitress and set the glass down and sat back in the chair on the other side of the table. She reached out and grabbed Gwen's hand and placed it on her leg.</p> <p>"Would you be upset if we had to take your panties off right here and right now?"</p> <p>"I don't care," Gwen replied, leaning towards Tasha. "But this could get very interesting."</p> <p>"Please, don't be afraid," the waitress continued, lifting the hem of Gwen's dress up as far as she could.</p> <p>Gwen watched in eager excitement as Tasha's hand ran up and down her thigh. Both women could almost feel their own breathing in their chairs as both looked into each other's eyes.</p> <p>"You're very beautiful, Tasha," Gwen complimented, placing her hand over Tasha's. "And you don't have anything that big to use as a 'glimp-dress'. I'm glad you like it."</p> <p>"I think I've had enough wine already," Tasha smiled. She leaned in and kissed Gwen deeply.</p> <p>Gwen's eyes opened wide as Tasha sucked on her lips, tongue and clit. Her own fingers massaged Gwen's tits.</p> <p>"Oh yeah," Gwen murmured. "That's so nice."</p> <p>Tasha's fingers were inside Gwen's wet pussy as she sucked on hers, causing her to moan as she pushed a finger in as far as it would go.</p> <p>"Oh yeah, keep fingering me, Ms. Ritter. Just as Ms. Seltzer did. I was wondering what that would feel like."</p> <p>They looked deeply into each other's eyes as the tongues continued to mingle. Tasha's fingers were buried deep inside Gwen as she suck on Gwen's clit causing the other woman to groan in an equally loud moan.</p> <p>"I love fingering you, Ms. Ritter," Tasha said, reaching a hand up to take Gwen's right nipple between her fingers. "And this is making it hard," she added, pulling down hard on the stiffening nipple, forcing Gwen's nipple to harden. "And it feels so good. And that thing you call a tongue really looks cute when it slides over it."</p> <p>"Oh yeah, Ms. Seltzer has really had an effect on me, too. And I know you liked what she did when she put her tongue on your 'little clit' as much as you do," Gwen saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
