"I saw your heart pounding. I hope you slept well."</p> <p>"I did," said Matt, nodding his head and smiling as though it might just happen.</p> <p>"You're going to have to leave soon," said Cindy. She turned to me, her eyes meeting my own. "I know, I know. It's just a bit much." She smiled sweetly. "I know."</p> <p>"So could you help me get ready for bed?" I asked.</p> <p>"Oh, don't worry. I'll get everything just right!" she laughed. "Here, let me show you." She reached under the mattress sheet and pulled out a large pink box of toiletries. As she bent down to close it, it was clear to me that she had planned all this before she even left the house. I had a feeling that whatever it was, it was pretty.</p> <p>"Um," said a puzzled Matt. "What are you doing here?"</p> <p>"Just you," she smiled. "Can you come get changed?"</p> <p>"Of course!"</p> <p>Cindy came off of the bed naked to stand in front of me. "Take your shirt off."</p> <p>"But," I managed to gasp, "But you're so beautiful."</p> <p>For a moment she stood and admired me. Then she stepped toward me and ran her hands slowly up my legs, to my chest and stomach and I felt her fingers running down my chest, over my rib cage and across my stomach and sides. "You have such amazing muscles." she said and then smiled at me as she looked me up and down once more</p> <p>"What's this?" I asked.</p> <p>"Just look at yourself," she said. "Go ahead. This time you can do anything you want with it."</p> <p>She pulled the sheet down and let it slip off my body. I looked at her in the mirror and then looked down at my crotch. She saw my cock and giggled as she ran her fingers up and down the length of it. "I love your cock!" she grinned. "It's so big." She leaned forward and ran her tongue around the crown of it twice before taking it into her mouth. I closed my eyes and reached out both hands to try to find her mouth hair but ended up pulling them away. She released my cock and stood up. "Not now. It's kind of early for it. I still have to finish off your bath."</p> <p>"I'm not going anywhere." I said. "That whole thing is pretty sexy."</p> <p>"It's fun!" she giggled as she grabbed one of the fluffy bath towels. "You're going to love it!"</p> <p>She dried me off and then turned on the shower. I followed suit a few seconds later. I saw where she had taken all of the towels but I wouldn't have cared to see where she had hung them. I was starting to enjoy her teasing me all over again. As she bent over to pick up one of the other towels, I saw her ass wiggling as she tossed the towel in the direction of us. Once she had gotten it, she turned and smiled at me. "Wanna join me?"</p> <p>"Hell, I can't." I said and then smiled at her. "Actually, I can." I pulled the sheet back and looked down between my legs. She had a small jar of lotion in her hand. And I was looking down at her with pure lust in my eyes. I reached out and grabbed her bottom and pulled her hips toward me, my cock slipping effortlessly into her wet pussy. We both moaned together. "God, I love your cock!" Cindy cried out. "I love your cock!"</p> <p>We held each other and kissed all the way home.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>It was a bit hard to explain her behavior at the beginning. We didn't just do what we did - we took it to the next level. And when we did it, that was as much as it turned us on. But it turned us on in some very different ways!</p> <p>There was the moment when we couldn't have gotten enough of each other but instead of letting us get what we were looking for from one another, we took it into our own personal world. The fact that we weren't going back to our own marriage where we met the person we were meant that we wanted to make each other happy. But, in our own minds, we weren't giving each other what we both wanted. Our whole world was centered in the mutual satisfaction we shared by making each other happy with nothing but ourselves. As soon as we started making love, even though our bodies had already made love, the connection we made was only heightened.</p> <p>We weren't going to do something to the people we met, and that meant we wouldn't be living together andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
