I hold out the glass to you and you sip.</p> <p>"Don't stop," I say, and then lick my lips with my tongue. You drink a little more and I lick the wine and I'm smiling again. I push open the front of your shirt, exposing your bare chest.. I'm watching your face, trying to see if he's watching me. Your eyes are closed in concentration. I move my hands up to your chest and start to work at it. I rub you between my lips as I move down in between your legs. I'm so close I can taste the wine on your lips. I kiss your pussy but move up and lick at your clit, still not touching the glass with my fingers.</p> <p>"Ohhhhh," you moan and I take my tongue and put it in you, not at all rough. I run my tongue up and down, and then up against your clit. I push my tongue as deep as I can into your pussy. You're already wet up. I start licking up and down and pushing it as far into your pussy as I can. I feel your legs start to shake again and I don't stop. You're grabbing my hair, trying to pull me into you. I feel you orgasm, and again I don't stop. As I look up at you I see your eyes closed, your mouth wide and your lips trembling as I lick you dry. I move up beside you and we kiss again, letting the wine and the wine run together.</p> <p>"I'm thinking I should call the police," you whisper, but the glass in your hand makes me feel a little better.</p> <p>"Maybe after you cum a little, you'll want to do the same for me," I tease, and press my hand down on your leg.</p> <p>You smile and move your hand to my thigh. "Maybe, then," you giggle. "Maybe, you'll want to use me again," you say as you look me in the eye and look down.</p> <p>I smile at you. "I bet you do. And I bet you want to try."</p> <p>"I was hoping to, but not now....and I've been thinking about tonight all night."</p> <p>You raise your eyebrow at me and play around with the wine again, not making any move to go down. I know I'm making you nervous. You raise one eyebrow and look at me and your eyebrows go up in a questioning way. "What do you want to do?" you ask. I shrug and move around the bed, looking for a chair or something.</p> <p>"Let me sit in your lap tonight," I say and sit down in your lap.</p> <p>"But...." I look at your eyes. You've never looked at me that way before. My stomach muscles bunch up in anticipation of where my evening might end. "What if...." You have that look again.</p> <p>You turn me slightly and place your hands on top of mine on the arm of the couch. Your head rests on my shoulder. You lift both hands in front of me and place my hands on your shoulders. You look me in the eyes, your lips brushing against my ear as you lean forward and kiss me. You kiss my neck and slowly work your way to my ear, kissing my earlobe at the same moment you bite into it lightly. You lick my earlobe, and you can hear my sigh. The feel of your tongue in my ear brings me to the verge of orgasm quickly. I'm thinking again about the last time we made love....the kissing, the touching, the touching......</p> <p>The door opens and we jump out of bed. I stand up, my heart beating as slow as water in a pond as I turn to face the open doorway. I hear music, the words but not too loud.....</p> <p>"Hello," I say, voice shaking with excitement. You look at me surprised at what I say in response. "Is that you...." you say and pause. "Honey, what is it?" I hear your voice again. I smile and step around to you. There's no emotion in your face other then the fact that you like to play this game. "Would you like to stay up late tonight," you ask as you lean over to give me quick kisses, "in our bedroom?"</p> <p>"Let me give you something to drink, then.... if you want," I say, turning to hand you the glass.</p> <p>"Yes...yes, let me," you say and lean over you.</p> <p>I stand and pick up the glass, and bring it back to you. We've both been drinking much more than you, the wine is beginning to have its effect. I pick up a long stem from the glass, and dip a small dab of liquid into my mouthâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
