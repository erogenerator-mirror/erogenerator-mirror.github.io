After hanging up from the call, she looked at the map again. The number on the map and the name of the place were only a couple blocks west of where she and James were going. "Is there a city this time?" she asked. She checked the map again. It still didn't show up. She turned on the phone to the answering machine and answered it.</p> <p>The machine started to play a song from the movie, "Come On, Come On," and she quickly took the phone to the other end. She was on the phone, in her bra and panties when she heard her cell phone dinging.</p> <p>"Hi! Sorry I wasn't expecting someone. Yeah it's a busy time at work, so I thought you'd have a chance to pick up sometime. Well I did have a lot to pick up on, a real man on my last visit. And that's why I called so early. Yeah, I know why you're so hard at work, but I got to stop, can you wait a minute." It sounded kind of lame, even though she'd said it out loud without really having said much of anything to him. She'd only been back to him for a couple hours and not been in his place much. She didn't think she'd even finished her dinner.</p> <p>"Yeah, sorry, I wasn't actually in your area last night. I kind of left to catch a bus so I figured you'd probably be back. Well, I was supposed to be here in the early morning, but I got pretty late, but I'm in a hurry. So what's up tonight, are you coming in?"</p> <p>"Yeah, sorry, no plans except to hang out with you around noon." She hung up with a grin.</p> <p>"Well, don't worry about it, I'm not going to be in my bar, and I don't have long before I'm going to have to come outside to run errands. We can hang out a bit."</p> <p>"That's a bit on the short side, I'm sure I'll be in the back by 11. I better get going, I have to get back downtown at 5, or I might just not be able to go straight, and I can probably get back downtown by 3."</p> <p>"Well, thanks again, I look forward to hanging out, I'll see you there. Bye!" as she hung up. She hung up with another smile to herself as well.</p> <p>As soon as she hung up, she dialed James's number and waited. He picked up the phone.</p> <p>"James," his voice was like honey in the phone. "Where have you been?"</p> <p>"Yeah sorry, I was in town shopping, some stuff I had to do, but can't be helped. You have my number?"</p> <p>"Yeah what did you want to tell me?"</p> <p>"Well, there's no time."</p> <p>"I know, I'll pick up my car in the parking garage later."</p> <p>"Do you mean you want me to catch you somewhere, or something?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I mean, would that get me anything besides your wife at home?"</p> <p>"Yeah, if you don't wanna run into me like that, how does that sound?"</p> <p>"I'd just tell her you're in a hurry, and that's all it's that I'm going to be home. I'll pick you up, I'll be there for a bit."</p> <p>"Yeah, sure, I'll hurry. I'm just about to get ready."</p> <p>"Don't worry, we can get there by 6. We're going out for dinner," James quickly responded.</p> <p>"No, no, don't worry about that. No, I just wanted to let you know that I'll be there on time."</p> <p>"Yeah, that's all fine," as he hung up. "I just didn't get that at home. It's just so important when I say this that I mean it."</p> <p>"Well, it is important. Just don't get any ideas, please. This is all serious stuff, no fun really. Well you need to stop with James, and get a better place. It's not worth it. Just don't do anything that wouldn't cause trouble."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I guess I don't really understand that part. This is serious, you sure you're not going? I mean it's only sex. This is so personal."</p> <p>"Yeah, I really want to know, and I'm a very special friend of yours. I just can't do this kind of thing. Besides, your husband knows."</p> <p>"I wish I couldâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
