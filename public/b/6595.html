It's been a while. I think we want to take our time. We take our time to feel your body, to feel you. We make slow undemanding love.</p> <p>We move towards you. I kiss your mouth, your throat. I lick the area around your left ear. I feel your breath on my lips as I kiss you and my hand slides onto your body. You turn your head away. My lips and tongue kiss your throat. You reach out to touch my face, but I press my lips into yours and gently push you down. You feel the hardness of my cock press against your pelvis and suddenly you are pressed hard into me.</p> <p>I start to move my hips, moving my cock against you. I can feel you move against me.</p> <p>I am pushing my hips and it feels good. I can feel your pubic hairs rubbing against my cock; you are pressing against me.</p> <p>I whisper in your ear, "Let me do this baby...if I can take this...if I can make you feel good."</p> <p>You shake in protest and reach between us to get your hand around me, holding me firmly and gently. I can feel you start to move against me again....a little harder and a little faster.</p> <p>I can't take it anymore. I move one of my hands down between us and start to run my fingers over your pussy, my fingertips meeting just where I want them to be. My fingers feel the wet, warm, slick wetness I see as you move your hips against me. My fingers are soaked as I run them over the head of my cock.</p> <p>I am pushing your hair off your neck as I slide my fingers down to stroke the lips of your pussy. I can feel the heat, the moisture as I slide my finger along your slit. I can feel you move against me, rubbing against my fingers.</p> <p>We are slowly moving. Faster and faster....faster and faster...........</p> <p>I can feel your pussy tightening around me. I can feel you moving you hips.</p> <p>My body goes stiff. I push hard against you, fucking your pussy. I can feel my cock pressed into you. I can feel your body shake.</p> <p>I am pulling you on to me, I fucking you with mine. Your body is shaking. My fingers are still wet with your pussy juices...you are shaking in pain.</p> <p>You are shaking.</p> <p>And then you are exploding....you are pushing hard against me and I can feel your body trembling.</p> <p>I press my fingers against you to feel your juice run down my fingers and you pull on my shoulder.....</p> <p>And then it's all over.</p> <p>You reach down and start running your hands all over your body as I look at you.</p> <p>My cock is sticking up like a flagpole from your thigh, I reach down and wrap my hand around it and start to stroke it. You are rubbing your clit with the fingers of one hand and I can feel you start to cum. You are rubbing your clit harder and faster as you feel your orgasm explode through you.</p> <p>I can't hold back any more. I start to cum, and I can feel your body tense and freeze in the afterglow.</p> <p>I continue to stroke, until I can't hold back any more. I let go of the swollen head and release it so I can pull you towards me.</p> <p>I look into your eyes and can feel you smiling.</p> <p>Then I whisper gently in your ear, "That was wonderful."</p> <p>I start to move my mouth onto yours. I give you a long, hard kiss before I slowly lift you up and gently bring you onto the bed. I sit in your lap facing your bed, as you watch in stunned disbelief that I am here.</p> <p>I can feel your cock slowly growing under me and I think about how good it feels to take it out and push it back in. I look back at you at the same time and I start to stroke myself.</p> <p>I start to move slowly, teasingly and feeling every movement you make. I love your reaction. Your hips start to grind to my strokes</p> <p>Suddenly you are on top of me. As you sit up and bring me up to lie between your legs. You lean down and start to kiss me passionately again.</p> <p>You are straddling me, holding me. I can feel every inch of you as you start to pull away. Your hand runs up my thigh again to my cock.</p> <p>I can feel you sliding that hand up and down the shaft, back and forth. We feel our pubic hairs meshing together when you wrap both hands around me and hold me to you for a few moments.</p> <p>You take one hand from my cock and hold it up to your face.</p> <p>You move it slowly towards your mouth ...to kiss the end ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
