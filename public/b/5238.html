Troy had also attended a college near the beach on the West Coast, where he had met the love of his life, his sister, a beautiful redhead who had helped him when he and the other guests came up a storm.</p> <p>As the couple walked into the office, they found that the room had been tidied up a bit during the break, and a couple of the old chairs were pulled and rearranged out. Troy didn't notice the new desk and computer where Karen was sitting; he knew she had come to work because he could see the name on the phone number on the screen: 'Karen Moore.' He glanced through the screen for a moment and noticed the name on a small computer screen: D.O.'s. He grinned and waved in recognition. The smile returned to his face as he watched the screen, watching the phone numbers on its screen read: 'D.O.G.L.' He looked down at himself and saw the number: 'Karen Moore.' He knew who it was: he couldn't believe who it was.</p> <p>When Karen came into the office, she was the boss's favorite: a beautiful, well-dressed woman. A little taller than him, Karen stood about 5' 6" and weighed about 130. Although her body was slim, she had a beautiful figure and was dressed stylishly in a black business suit: black with a plunging neckline and a very tight, formfitting pencil dress, which left the top few buttons just down the front so he could see her bare breasts. As she walked, her breasts bounced slightly and her dress gapped when she walked and he could see her bare legs.</p> <p>They sat down right away, at the computer. Karen reached across the desk and flipped through a couple of websites and began to type. Troy watched as she typed and typed. He watched her eyes as they worked. She smiled at him and looked at his face. She looked him up and down with her eyes. He smiled back and noticed her legs almost touched the chair.</p> <p>"Hey, Karen," Troy said, pulling a book close to his face and reading it in silence. "You're so beautiful," he said, as if he had suddenly forgotten he had ever bought a watch. "You look stunning, in fact, if you were a young girl I would have bought you a watch myself," he continued.</p> <p>Karen smiled back at him. He hadn't even started his conversation - she was his favorite - so she took her time with her typing. "Thank you, Troy, and I'm glad you like it," she said.</p> <p>Troy looked her over and realized that she had been looking at him. "Karen, I ...," he stammered. As he said the name, he took her chair at his desk and asked, "Why don't you turn the computer off and we can finish this right away" as if he read her mind. He looked at her, but she continued to continue to type without interruption.</p> <p>"I'm sure we can do that," Karen said, looking up at him. "Do you?" He nodded his approval, but was not sure of the correct answer. "But would I be able to do this?" he wondered.</p> <p>Karen stood up and stretched, arching her back. She turned to face Troy and said, "Sure, I'm all yours now. Why don't you sit down here." Karen motioned for him to stand close to her. He sat down in the chair and looked around the room. Karen picked up the file on the computer and began reading it. Then, as she did so, she lifted the top third of the folder and opened the folder. She turned the file over and began to type it. She looked at him as she typed: 'Karen Moore' and looked at him as she opened it: 'Karen Moore, from the website I've found and downloaded and I'd like to get a hold of you at that moment and find out who you are.' Troy took the folder and began reading again.</p> <p>Once he finished reading, Karen said: 'I should get back to the computer and get back to work'. She turned to go.</p> <p>"Wait," he said, holding out his hand. She looked at him and his hand and then looked down at the folder. "You can't be serious, Karen," Troy said. Now, Karen didn't look as serious as she had before. She reached across the desk and began taking his hand. He smiled at her.</p> <p>"There is another website on the computer. I know your sister," she said softly. 'The website', Troy thought and saw her point with her words. He nodded silentlyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
