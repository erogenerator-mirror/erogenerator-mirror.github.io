I sat up and grabbed both of his wrists with my other hand. I held both of his wrists in one hand and held his wrists in the other.</p> <p>"Fuck me," I whispered quietly.</p> <p>I could see he was struggling against my hold. I grabbed both of his wrists again in one hand and grabbed his cock with the other hand. I began to lightly stroke the head of his cock while I continued to kiss him. I felt his cock get harder.</p> <p>"Take off your pants," I said.</p> <p>He reached his hands down and unzipped his pants. I reached down and pulled down his underwear, revealing his hard cock in its black glory. It was about six inches long and about six and a half inches wide which is what I estimated it to be. I let his shirt down and reached behind my back to unzip my bra. I lowered my bra and dropped it on the floor. I stepped out of my panties and he looked up at me. His eyes were fixed on my chest in that special way it does to me, the way my nipples were sticking out so nicely in the dark.</p> <p>He stepped forward and pressed his lips to mine. We had never done anything like that before in the privacy of my bedroom. Our kisses were long and gentle and sweet and he held my breasts in my hands and gently teased my nipples between his fingers. As we kissed, I unbuttoned his shirt and let it slide off of his back. My hand drifted down his chest to his waist as we continued the slow, sensual journey over each other's body. I felt his nipples hardening with the contact of my fingertips as I moved my hand down his stomach toward the elastic of his pants.</p> <p>He slipped his hands from my breasts and ran his thumbs over my nipples.</p> <p>"Mmm," I moaned when they came into view.</p> <p>I unbuttoned his pants and slowly pulled them down, stopping just at the waistband of his underwear. I pulled his waistband down and off his muscular body as I kicked his pants off to the floor where it came to a halt. I looked up at him and smiled before putting both my hands against his stomach and pulling him onto my hard cock. I lifted his butt up so I could pull down his briefs with my hands. I could see his cock getting erect and thick already. I felt my manhood grow hard from the contact of the cool air outside the door and the smell of his manly desire.</p> <p>I sat him up against the wall and quickly sat up on me knees. His legs spread open and my hands roamed over every inch of his beautiful frame.</p> <p>He looked directly up at me as I ran my hands over his chest and stomach. He reached down and grabbed his shirt from my hands as I ran my hands slowly up and down his body. My hands glided over his bare chest and stomach. I took each nipple into my fingers and pinched and twisted as my lips and my fingers found his lips. He opened his mouth and his tongue went straight into mine. His arms went around my neck and held me tightly until our tongues and lips were just touching. His lips pulled back from mine. Then he pulled me in a little tighter against him and we again kissed. The kiss grew in intensity and in heat as my hands reached up to touch and pull on his nipples. I felt my manhood becoming even harder once again. Our kissing and touches grew more demanding as the heat of our passion began to increase.</p> <p>He finally broke our kiss and broke away from mine. He looked down at my stiff penis as I sat up against the wall. I was now so turned on by the contact of my manhood within my hands. I was so aroused at his touch that I was afraid I was going to lose control.</p> <p>"Lay down on your back" he said.</p> <p>I felt so excited that I quickly began to get down on my back on the bed. He stood up and went down toward me where I lay on my back. I looked up at him as he approached my neck.</p> <p>"On your stomach" he said.</p> <p>I raised myself up a little as he laid next to me on his side. I let the warm night air touch my hair and bare back. I felt his body next to mine and felt his erection against me. He laid right up next to me with his face on my stomach, his warm breath felt so sensual and so good on my skin.</p> <p>"I have always thought having someone that I can touch me with and kiss me with would be such a turn-on for me. Seeing someone who is so sexual and so much more sensual and sexual, in love with you is just that," he said, "It will be so easy to fall in love with you and fall in love with each otherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
