As they were pulling up to the front, they were startled out of their daze when it began to dawn on them that their hosts had an emergency meeting with the State government on the phone tomorrow.</p> <p>Chapter 11</p> <p>When the meeting took place, George pulled into the office parking lot where the building was located, and was surprised when a beautiful young lady walked out and walked towards them. "Well, what do you think? Are yer ladies happy to be at home for this very long?" she asked, looking at the girls, who were also walking, just talking to George. As soon as she got closer to them, the young woman turned to the side, and as she turned to look back at George, she suddenly looked right at him, and in that instant, he saw that he had the most intense, alluring smile that he'd ever seen on any face. The only thing he could do was stare as he noticed the most wonderful smile; but he just smiled back at the lovely young woman standing in front of him.</p> <p>"Well, hello, dear brother!" she said, her voice almost breaking, "I see you've been home for some time now!" she continued, her voice a bit more confident now, "Well, I would be very grateful for that. The girls here have a really big party this week and I'm sure it will be at some very lavish parties. Don't you think so, George?" the young woman asked.</p> <p>George smiled a bit and just nodded back, his smile getting wider still as I looked back at them, he knew what that smile was for. "Do you think we'll still be able to?" he asked her.</p> <p>"You bet I do! Come on inside and I'll introduce ya' to some of the other guests for the weekend," she told him as she led him up the steps from the car. As they headed up the stairs, they turned back towards the reception building, and she said, "See y'all out there tonight!" and then she walked quickly out to her car, and took off back towards the State offices, telling them it would be okay just to wait. George was a little taken aback for a few seconds, but he knew she was right.</p> <p>Chapter 12</p> <p>As the afternoon approached and when it was just starting to get dark once the sun began to move just slightly, they sat down in a booth and talked about the girls' plans for the next day. George couldn't stop himself from talking the entire time, and he was really intrigued by what the two of them had talked about.</p> <p>"I remember that, dear friend!" the young woman said, finally giving his wife a chance to come. This was George's first real chance to talk to her. He couldn't believe it! And to be honest, he was curious. "Anyway dear, if you don't mind going ahead and do something with your time, I can just go over your plans with the kids for you... and you can work off your little budget if yer really interested."</p> <p>For some reason, George simply said, "Yeah!" at that, he just wanted to hear her say it, even though he was completely lost in the moment. He could tell she could have been very excited, if she was! She was such a beautiful young woman... and he couldn't wait to see what she was wearing that evening. "It's no problem at all," she said. "Just have the kids be all ready for that party."</p> <p>"I can't wait," George said to his wife. "They're going to be up here early this evening."</p> <p>"I've had a lot of good time, George. I can't imagine having more than one party in the house!" she replied, giving him a knowing smile. "Just go to the store and get some decent clothes. I'll grab a couple of things you might want. Oh, and you can make sure yer little lady is ready and then go out and enjoy yourself. Maybe the kids' party will take care of its work," she laughed as she spoke, "It's so fun!"</p> <p>George smiled to himself, feeling somewhat foolish. This beautiful young woman, who he had seen on the phone all evening, was going to get a good night's sleep after all. "I'll go to the store and get some nice clothes too after we eat. There's no need to keep me waiting," he told her, wanting to be sure he was sincere.</p> <p>"Alright, dear," she replied with a smile as she turned to George. "And, if you need anything," she added, "just let me know. This is going to be fun, if you don't mind."</p> <p>"Actually, thank you," he replied. "You can go on homeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
