She reached behind her and, still gripping my still hard cock, gave it a squeeze. It jerked and a wet trickle ran out of her lips and down her chin. "I'm really hungry."</p> <p>I lifted the plate over from her and, picking up her coat and a small pile of paper, led her back into the restaurant, past the cashiers of the bar, where she had a seat.</p> <p>A table was set up in a corner, opposite a window that seemed to have a view over the pool and the river. Beyond the window, it looked out over the city. The smell of the wine, the wine, the smell of the flowers and the smell of the air, almost an aphrodisiac, and the scent of sex was overpowering and intoxicating.</p> <p>We all sat, me in the middle, and her legs crossed, legs that had been crossed a moment ago. Even though we are friends we knew she had already been aching to feel a man in her for hours and it still felt good. She kept looking down at her hands, her fingers moving slightly with each motion.</p> <p>I was feeling the same things for her on the other part of my body. I could see the curve of her hip in the front of her slacks, but with her legs spread apart I could tell she was clearly sitting there. She looked down between her legs, obviously trying to find the right position for what she wanted. Then, looking up at me, I saw her look down at herself, the little "fuck me" smile, her little pouting, and then her hand dropped.</p> <p>I'm not sure I could hold it. I just couldn't.</p> <p>I looked down at my half opened door for a moment, then, looking over at her, I said, "You see, I did not know what kind of woman you were. The first time I was with you I actually went through your things. I wanted to see your lips and those eyes. After that I thought maybe you did it for me, maybe you could have any man I've ever had and maybe what you did for me in bed was because I wanted some real cock, some real man-stuff..." I stopped talking just to hear my own voice tremble, my voice hoarse.</p> <p>I kept trying to hold the thought of her, that she was married, that it could never, never happen again. But then, when I saw her do things with a stranger and I was not sure if I wanted to hear it or think of her and, again, just keep going, it just didn't occur to me that she would have to be a stranger.</p> <p>When I spoke to her again it was like a bolt of pleasure shot through my body. I tried to imagine what she would do, what would feel good. I know I said I was going over the top at that point, but, for some reason, I had to keep on speaking to her and trying to be that person. And, as much as I tried to be alluring and good natured, the thoughts I tried so hard to make themselves vanished as soon as they were out. I remember when she was playing with her pussy and playing with my cock, and just watching, like, wow, I was hard thinking about her. Her nipples were standing up like little points against her t-shirt, hard against her t-shirt. I remembered watching her masturbate just after they came, and just looking at her do it while I was watching. It was really sexy. I could not even think of how she might react.</p> <p>She must have caught me in the midst of my thoughts. "No more, no more. I want you to watch what you've done. Let's just get up and get dressed." She pulled me down next to her and we went out the door. The bar was emptying out a bit. It had taken her about a minute or so to get through all of those things, which was unusual in a public place. The bar was a very popular place but I remember being the last person in the place. I had stopped off to let her in and she went straight to her car, with me following. She started her car and we went down the street, got in the back seat and headed to the hotel.</p> <p>When I told her how hard it had been to watch her, how I always wished I could be there with her I had been amazed and amazed at the idea that she even thought about her husband having sex with a stranger. But, it was as much me doing the unthinkable as her. We arrived at the hotel and the room and she gave me the keys and we started to take off our clothes.
