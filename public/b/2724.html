I was shocked to see a gorgeous woman wearing only panties and her bra. She was looking at the door but no one else was in the room. I knocked on the door twice to ask if she was there. She answered and stepped back slightly.</p> <p>"I thought it might be you," she said. "And besides, you are still dressed. How long have you been back for?"</p> <p>"About six months," I said.</p> <p>"Wow," she said, stepping back and looking at the small mirror and the body. "The last time I saw those were when you were in the car with me on the way home. Are you wearing panties, too?"</p> <p>"No," I replied. "That was what I was wearing."</p> <p>"Can't have those things being lost forever," she said. "I bet they are a sight for sore eyes. You sure have filled them out," she added, as she reached out and began rubbing my face. "You look terrific!"</p> <p>She leaned against the door and rubbed my face as I stared into her eyes. She lifted her hand to my lips and traced a finger along them as I stuck out my tongue and she stroked between them.</p> <p>"Is that nice?" she said. "Would you like to get naked while I look at you?"</p> <p>"You can do whatever you like," I answered.</p> <p>"I'm glad you agree," she said, sliding the robe off her shoulders and running her hands over her body. My eyes ran down to her tits. I could see that they were much smaller around than I was used to. The nipples were large and stood high on her chest. The were erect and proud on her tits so proudly, looking like miniature jello. I lifted my hands and cupped them. She moved her hands down and placed them on my upper thighs. A smile crossed my face as I held my pussy.</p> <p>"Let me help you," she said. My hands felt soft and smooth but not over so. I squeezed in and watched her face as I ran my fingers through her hair. She continued rubbing me as my fingers went on feeling my nipples and down and over her stomach. I loved every sensation.</p> <p>"Do you like what you see?" she asked, stroking my pussy lips, causing me to moan.</p> <p>"I'm not sure I've never seen anything like you," I said.</p> <p>"Don't lie," she said, grabbing my legs and rubbing up my inner thighs and legs. "You're soaking wet," she said. "You really got a mess down there. Why don't you clean it up for me?"</p> <p>"Yes Sir, please!" I said, grabbing my wet, sticky crotch, sliding my panties down my legs and stepping out of them.</p> <p>"So good to see you," she said, putting her hands on my hips and helping her to step up to me. One of her fingers was slowly working between my lips as we stood before each other, looking at each other. My mind was racing and my mouth was dry.</p> <p>"God you look beautiful," she said. "That's my girl! I like it when they call me that."</p> <p>"Thank you," I answered, feeling my pussy throb. "But I do have to put these things away. You really get me turned on!"</p> <p>"Oh don't worry," she said, smiling at me. "We have plenty of time. It's my first time with you like this."</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I asked softly.</p> <p>"Uh huh," she answered and gave me a small peck on the cheek. She put her hands on my bare waist and started pulling my robe off. I raised my hands so she could pull me over to the desk.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want me to get these for you?" she asked pulling me back into the room as she took a few pictures. She took the clothes off of me and handed them to a customer.</p> <p>"Would you be upset if I got one for you?" I asked, smiling when she said that.</p> <p>"You would do that for me, too," she said. "Now let's get these off so you can see yourself in the full-length mirror."</p> <p>She bent down and began taking pictures. My pussy was dripping with desire. "Is your pussy still wet?" she asked, putting her hands on the table and looking down.</p> <p>"Oh yes," I said, trying to keep from asking her to undo the clips that hung down by my knees. "And this is what you wereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
