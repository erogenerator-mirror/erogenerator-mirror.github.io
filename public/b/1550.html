But I decided to find out if I could just keep my head high off my shoulders because all the others were getting up and walking off!</p> <p>"Hmmm, I really should have thought of that," I thought to myself. I was a bit of a disappointment in that regard, as it meant that the one time I had been caught by a girl with some "extra help" was just over a little farther south I could see. But now I was getting back into the same sort of condition. I decided to go with my instinct.</p> <p>When I got to the bus stop, I headed straight toward it. I sat in the middle, between myself and the door, and I had to get to a guy's bench. There was an older man seated there. He was probably about in his seventies or eighties or eighties if he sat on the bench right beside me. As I got closer to him, I could see that he was pretty well groomed up, and he looked very sexy.</p> <p>I decided to take my seat at the bench next to him. As I sat down, he got up and came and sat down next to me.</p> <p>"Thank you for a pleasant ride." He turned his head back and smiled. I'm sure he had some difficulty getting that smile. I'm sure it was probably something like 'thank you, sir' but I'm sure it was more like 'sir'. "You're quite welcome, Mr. Sanders." I didn't know if he could do it much but I thought it was very friendly. After I thanked him, he said, "Thank you, sir", again before he got to his feet.</p> <p>"You can take a seat." I motioned around the benches for several minutes. He sat down. I didn't think anything of the fact that he could have gotten the bench next to me. It seemed pretty good, although the bench I was standing on was a little higher than I would normally stand on. It also gave him an even better view of my legs than the rest of my upper body. I noticed that he was wearing a pair of khaki shorts.</p> <p>Just before I sat down, he leaned in and whispered, "Thank you for a very nice ride, sir."</p> <p>"I'm so glad you liked it. It was nice to meet a young man of a little better stature." But we both were getting a bit flush. We both knew he noticed me, and it didn't seem like a big deal anymore.</p> <p>As we talked, I realized that this was the first time in the past two days we hadn't seen each other. I told him that I was going to head home today for a couple of days. I decided to leave just after I finished my morning meeting. "Well, you know what I'm hoping to get out of it?"</p> <p>"You do, sweetie? You can come out with me anytime you want, I'm sure." I think I almost blushed. "Well, I have a place in mind, if you'd like to come. I have a lot of the equipment that you might want to use."</p> <p>He just grinned. "Yes ma'am, Mr. Sanders."</p> <p>Before I went, he asked me if I had any "toys". I had, but didn't know what they were. The only thing I could think of was the fact that I was looking at him more than anything else. I was also sure that he couldn't see me looking at him, and it turned me on a bit, especially when he said, "Would be rude not to stare when you're having a free show."</p> <p>He took a small black leather box out of his jacket and held it toward me. "Would you like that, sweetie?" I couldn't imagine doing that, but I knew that there was no harm in showing it.</p> <p>He handed me the box, and I opened it up. Inside was a small vibrator, and the rest of it was probably still in the plastic packaging it had been in for so long. I thought it was a bit of a stretch, but I guess it was what I need to be able to do. As I took it and put it on the table next to me, I thought to myself, oh well. As I turned to walk toward the bus, I saw that he smiled and winked at me.</p> <p>When I got to the exit towards my apartment, I was disappointed, but not as disappointed as I was going to be! I pulled the bus to a halt right in front of me and I waited as the bus left the terminal and moved off.</p> <p>It was just as I thought. I was standing next to the bench that I was sitting on! A bus full of people waited at the bus stop, withâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
