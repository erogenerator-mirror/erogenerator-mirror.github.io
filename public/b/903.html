Wait! How is it I didn't get to cum that much before?" I asked, as I felt the wetness of my pussy leaking over my fingers.</p> <p>"Don't you dare cum until I tell you to," I hissed in his ear; "No one told you to fuck on the couch!"</p> <p>"Gawd no! I'm sorry," he said, his voice almost cracking with disappointment.</p> <p>"Are you disappointed now?" I asked, "This was an experiment? Are you disappointed?"</p> <p>"Of course I'm disappointed," he pleaded, "Why can't you cum? I'm disappointed! God I haven't cum!"</p> <p>"You got to be kidding," I smiled at him; "You're such a sweet boy."</p> <p>"I'm serious," he panted, "I'm disappointed. I should stop. What is wrong with me?"</p> <p>"You got to do something," I told him, "It's a test. Come on, go in to the room and have a shower. I want you to lick me clean like a good boy."</p> <p>"I'm not a man," he protested, "I'm not a man. A man can't touch himself until he's given his first orgasm."</p> <p>"Don't you dare touch yourself," I hissed at, "It's our job isn't it?"</p> <p>"I don't think so," he replied, "But you have to, you HAVE to!"</p> <p>"That's ok," I told him, "Let me make it up to you. I can give you a gift that you'll never forget."</p> <p>"Oh god you can. Give me a gift," he whispered in my ear, and after a brief hesitation I began to massage his cock. He almost immediately began to harden in my hand, which I slowly massaged up and down along his shaft.</p> <p>"I know you have to," I said, slowly squeezing the base of his cock and pulling the skin up and down, "but I want you to go down on me first."</p> <p>"I-I-I can't. It's my dick," he stammered, "No man has done this before!"</p> <p>"I know you do," I smiled at him, "You have to make me cum. Don't worry. I'll make you cum."</p> <p>"No my man. Let's go," he whispered; "Let's go get cleaned up, and get dressed."</p> <p>"Don't you dare," I laughed a little, knowing how much it meant to him. I started to play with his nipples again, which only made him hornier. We dressed, kissed and I went off to the bathroom to change.</p> <p>"There," I said as I looked at the mirror, "He's a cute boy. Now go get cleaned up and meet me in the bedroom."</p> <p>My husband left the house and I started to clean up. I decided to stop by the bathroom to wash up because I needed to get ready for the next session. I sat with one of the hotel's pool tables near the water. I had to use an old shower head to keep myself in order so I had to put some warm water on before I could put it on the table. As I was doing this, I looked at the clock again. It was after 2:00am. I looked in my purse for my cell. There it was; the number I had called at the motel. I picked up the phone. It was answered by the owner: "It's me. My client needs a favor from you." I was surprised that he would ask for a favor from me. It sounded very weird and I guess to me that it probably wouldn't have seemed to me unusual in the least.</p> <p>"It's okay. I'm sorry that he can't get his cock out so fast," I apologized, "I'll call him back later. Please don't worry about it," I said, "It's our secret."</p> <p>"Ok," he grumbled, "I won't tell anyone. I promise you now that I have my cock out. I won't tell your friends."</p> <p>"That's wonderful," I smiled at him, and turned the phone on again, "He said you promised to do something for him that you didn't do for anyone else, so let's have my friend. What's his name?"</p> <p>"Mark," he said, "You can tell him you won't tell anyone, just make it a quickie."</p> <p>"Okay," I smiled at him, "We have a deal. He wants to see the video of you and your friend. It must be really memorable for both of you. He doesn't have a video. It would take me a day to send it to him."</p> <p>"Will I have to have another picture of youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
