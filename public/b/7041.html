She asked. "Why did he do it?"</p> <p>'Do what?' I wondered. I'm no expert in the field of the paranormal. I have to be patient for what I must do in that regard, but I'm a bit more experienced than you are, which is very welcome. I had to know exactly what it felt like to hear her moan as I pleasured her, but there was the little bit of hope that I may have been able to elicit. The thought of hearing her tell me the truth, of course, would have been enough for me to have brought about the idea, but there's no one in the universe who enjoys listening to a girl orgasm.</p> <p>"I could just go and lie on the bed," I muttered as I finished dressing. "I'll meet you at the entrance, and just hold yourself for a while." I closed the door behind me.</p> <p>I didn't know very well, yet. For once in my life, you don't have to be able to say 'no,' even to hear her in a state like the one we'd just had, just hear the sound of her voice, the feel of her breath under your chin and the sound of her soft moaning. There is a power, a natural power inside your body that, whenever you are within it, will keep you alive, and when that power is in your head, will keep you alive and on your guard. Even if a part of you is dead and you are alive, as you are right now, at least by your experience, there is something here that will keep a part of you alive even when you have died or amnesia.</p> <p>What was even better was when she had fallen asleep on top of me, and when I awoke at the height of my first orgasm, I was still feeling her body on top of me, and I found it oddly comforting to sleep next to one whom I love and respected deeply.</p> <p>The following day, I was back in my hotel, sitting in the bar with the sound of the music playing in my head. I looked around, and realized that I was the only one in the bar as I'd left. There was nobody else in the bar, I thought, and nobody seemed to be in a hurry to get out to the street.</p> <p>I sat in my booth for a while, and listened to the music, waiting for her to come and say her goodbyes to me. After what seemed like an eternity, I saw her come toward me, and I watched as her lips moved as she looked at me. She looked beautiful as she moved towards me, and her eyes were bright and alive, as she took my head in her hands and began to kiss me.</p> <p>I reached for her, and wrapped my arms around her. She turned her head to one side and put her cheek against mine, as our lips locked together. We held her as we kissed, feeling the full effect of one of the most tender moments we'd experienced in a long time. We kissed so many ways, it wouldn't have mattered if we'd been alone, even in any circumstances, and she had all of me in one body.</p> <p>It wasn't a long kiss, but it was a perfect one of intimacy. We parted as we felt the loss of our bodies, which seemed like a hundred years at the most. The taste of her lips on mine, the feel of her lips on mine...the feel of her body pressed against me...the feel of her hands, the feel of her skin against mine was the essence of her personality.</p> <p>I stood up, and put my hands, still wet by the kiss, inside her shirt and found no bra. I pushed her back, and undid her bra and threw it across the room. She reached down to free my hard cock as I knelt down between her legs, and with one kiss, she pulled it up off my body and began stroking it. She took me back into her mouth as I stood up for a second, but then took me back into her mouth, and stroked as I walked to the bedroom.</p> <p>I pulled her to me, and she wrapped her leg around my waist, holding me like a pillow as she kissed me. I felt the softness of her body on mine, and kissed her shoulder as I pushed her back onto the bed, and climbed onto her.</p> <p>I laid down, and she took me in her arms, kissing me all over, then pulling her mouth off for a second to stare at me. "I'm sorry...I've been a fool...you...you didn't," she begged. "Please, Mark," she moaned in her softness. "I'll never forgive myself if I don't, and you have to understand that. I wouldn't cheat on my husband...I can't."
