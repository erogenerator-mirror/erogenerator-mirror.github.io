I sat down and got up again. He had already gone to have his drink and was standing there waiting for me. His eyes were locked on the glass and my lips as they parted and I watched as his tongue extended and touched mine. I wanted to do it and pull away from him. When I looked back over the other end of the table he had the drinks held out. I slid them across and drank and looked over at him. "Do you want to leave?" I asked and he shook his head and smiled. "Would you rather drink alone or with me?" I asked and he smiled and nodded his head and I took my drink from him and then stood back. I got up and went back into the club again. The bartender handed me the drink and said ”Just a shot at first. Then I started dancing with some of the other dancers. The music pounded as I moved and moved with the other dancers. It was obvious that I was getting very old and I enjoyed the attention but I was not comfortable dancing like I used to.</p> <p>I looked around and saw other women who were all dancing together on the dance floor but I couldn't see that it was my husband in the next room. I didn't really care and wanted to leave but somehow I knew that the party was going to end soon. I looked over at my husband and he was watching me. I saw that he was watching me as well and then I decided that if I tried to leave I would be on my own. I quickly looked around again and saw people watching. I knew that no one would see or hear me dance but I felt safe with him. He took another drink of his drink as I danced and the music was so loud I had to make sure he watched me.</p> <p>"It's kind of a turn on when the man is watching you with someone else and I'm sure knowing that you are dancing around him." He whispered and I could tell I had him. He smiled and he turned to leave again. As he went out the table I moved close to him and I put a finger to his lips encouraging him to come back. He smiled and walked by me to turn his full attention to the bar and the woman dancing just yards down. I felt his arm come to my hips and he pulled me down into a deep kiss.</p> <p>"You've got a great body sweetheart." The woman said as she spun me around a bit and rubbed her breasts against me. She gave a smile and pulled her head away slightly and smiled and winked at me. "I always thought your wife's had a great body." She said and kissed my lips. As she kissed me, her hand rubbed my crotch and I was hard. She rubbed her nipples over me and then pushed me down. "Can I touch?" she panted in her lusty voice and I nodded my head.</p> <p>"Just you take your time baby." I heard her say and I felt her hand slip inside my wet underwear and grab my dick. I felt my mind spinning with lust and desire. She jerked my dick a few times and I felt him jerk his cock against the side of her hip. He felt his cock go soft but he leaned forward and kissed me again. "That wasn't so bad is it? Tell me how it feels and I'm sure it won't hurt you." She huskily purred in my ear and I nodded my head. "Would you suck me?" as she whispered in my ear. I nodded.</p> <p>"Say it." Was all she said and I felt her hand on my dick the way it felt when it was hard. She started stroking my cock up and down over my underwear. I had never felt anything like it and it was very wet. I almost lost it right then. "Show me." was all she said and she rubbed her hand under my briefs. It was then that the words came out. "I'd love to suck you and feel what it would be like to put my lips all over it." was all I said. "Will that be in a few minutes?" she asked and I gave an affirmative nod. "Take me to the bathroom now." was what she said and she grabbed a towel and took a quick feel her hand rubbed my pubic hair.</p> <p>What the hell was going on? He was the one making me do all of this! I don't know how or when my mind had taken that all in. Then he told me to turn around. I was afraid and wanted to get away but it was too late. He grabbed my arm and pulled me from the bar and I was shocked and turned on again at the same time. He had me on the table and was on top of me and his legs were between mine. The man on top of me just stared down at my boobs moving as his hand roamed over them.
