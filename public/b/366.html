I want to take time to love. I'm an adult, so I can see myself going to college and becoming a grandmother. I was thinking that maybe I could start a new life, and just come home and wait for my parents to come home and think I'm a very pretty adult that could really help them in the bedroom. I would really like this to work out for me, and I want to do it in a way that would make amends for my actions."</p> <p>"Sounds okay to me. I'm just not sure what to expect or what they'll want me to do. You'll either be there or you won't. It's going to be difficult with both of us being so different so different. I don't know what you'll think or how you'll feel when you have two children, but there it is on the surface. I hope I can please you that much on our next time."</p> <p>"No problem, I understand. When I met you I thought I was the love of your life."</p> <p>"That's okay. I still can't get over how much you love me. I just really need to find out where I will fit in with my family's social group. I don't just need to know what kind of life I want. I need to have to be honest with my family. I've got a way of making everyone else see that I'm worth living in the family. There, that's okay. I love you."</p> <p>We kissed again and he held me as I slid off the sofa and onto my husband's chest. This was just the way I thought they would take my relationship. They were going to let love be a part of our relationship and be with each other even if they were in agreement. That was what I wanted to happen. I just wanted there to be no commitment.</p> <p>I was still sobbing when I felt the man kiss me and hold me. We embraced and I buried my face in his chest, and he stroked my hair. I had no idea how to feel about that. He told me to put my foot down and go to sleep. I did and he held me until I fell asleep.</p> <p>The next time I would have to change my ways. He would be ready to talk about it. I have no way in telling whether he has any ideas or not.</p> <p>The last time, as I was leaving their place, they didn't come. He did come; and it was good for him. He said, "I'm not sorry and I want to get this done."</p> <p>"You will be. It won't be as important as you might think, but there's a way."</p> <p>*****</p> <p>"I know, you didn't really have any options when you went to college."</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess," I said. "I had to go through the entire summer with the kids. It was like I was trying to get the idea of my life into my head. I went to college without much success, but it was the best place to learn. It was the only place I would ever want to be. That was when the best part was over."</p> <p>"What did you do?"</p> <p>"I was a virgin. I had no choice. I had to be able to tell my parents that I was getting married before I could take a chance with a man just as I was getting involved with the kids. They were so upset that I got a big lecture like they did as a kid about how terrible life could be if you only lived out your life. The first year was awful. After college, I met John, our first son, John. It was awkward for me. He kept trying and I didn't really have the heart to tell him I knew.</p> <p>"I told my parents; and they didn't understand. It was like they were trying to force me to say something to them that I'd been trying to say to myself. I didn't have any real support.</p> <p>"By that time I wasn't really sure what was going on with me. My first boyfriend was my first lover, right?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"You met John and the rest are history. You have always loved him, and you know he loves you too. The first time John saw you there was something special between you. He didn't know that when He came home and took me into his arms."</p> <p>"We talked then?"</p> <p>"Yes. We talked. His first time was so good, he even tried to kiss me."</p> <p>"He has?"</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>"Doesn't he?"</p> <p>"Yeah.
