What could she do about that now? She pulled the front of her top down. Yes, no panties. She pulled away and stood up, turning away and dropping her back to the ground, her skirt still on the ground. She looked at me. I could see she had something to do with it as her gaze followed me. I took the panties and pulled them up. Did she know I had this?</p> <p>Her face brightened. She bent down to lick her finger clean. She stood up again. She looked at me. I could see she was looking me up and down. I wondered if she knew what I saw. Could she be looking at my cock because I was still erect? She licked her lips again.</p> <p>Well, if she had a cock then she'd have my underwear soon. But I'm sure it's just a little longer than a man's penis.</p> <p>She stepped back from me and looked at the table as if she might be a little disappointed to be alone.</p> <p>"What's wrong?" She asked. "The clothes are all wrinkled."</p> <p>She picked up the panties and took them back to me. She walked to the sink and washed her hands. She turned her back to me.</p> <p>"I took one of your underwear?"</p> <p>"Yes." I said.</p> <p>I had a pretty vivid memory of her standing in my kitchen in my bedroom wearing those. I wondered what else there was to do.</p> <p>"So what are these?" I asked.</p> <p>"They're my panties."</p> <p>"Are they all wrinkled?"</p> <p>"They're pretty good. I might as well be naked." She turned as she spoke, showing some of the panties she had on.</p> <p>"What about the bras?"</p> <p>"They're all wrinkled in here, they're wrinkled."</p> <p>I tried, maybe with some difficulty trying to remember her blouse and bra and everything she had worn before. I don't know why I would remember anything of her without them.</p> <p>"Well, I'm not going to try to explain, but you'll see. The panties are still a little wrinkled, but the bra doesn't mean anything. I'm not going to let you look at them in vain, so get a hold of these."</p> <p>She reached around and pulled them down her legs and tossed them into the pile of her clothes. She looked right at me. I looked away; wondering if I should turn around to face her.</p> <p>She handed me the bra.</p> <p>"Let's try that with these."</p> <p>She turned and bent forward to pull her shoes on and she held out one foot while she pulled the pantyhose off. She turned around. She could not miss that front of the panties. She stood with one leg straight out and her hand behind her back, showing off her ass. I noticed that her bottom crack was visible through the nylon.</p> <p>"I'm surprised you haven't seen what I was wearing." She said. "Maybe it's because you're not here."</p> <p>"I don't know what to tell you." I said. "It's none of your business."</p> <p>She looked at me with the top of her cleavage clearly showing. "Why don't you feel better?" she said, standing up again. "That bra is wrinkled but still sexy."</p> <p>I looked away.</p> <p>As she began to unbutton the blouse I was trying to say.</p> <p>"I'm not your little sister." I could remember the term perfectly, and I'm sure she must have guessed. If this wasn't incest, I would have stopped it. I still tried to stay out of it.</p> <p>"No, it's been awhile."</p> <p>She smiled at me, and took the blouse off over her head, showing the white bra I had noticed before. I couldn't hold my hands up in front of me and look at her. "You're all I'll ever see. I never realized what a beautiful woman you are."</p> <p>"Thanks. You're right. You look like you used to like to look at the pretty girls."</p> <p>She smiled. "I remember you looking at me."</p> <p>I shook my head again, my mind clearly focusing on what she said. "I'm sorry."</p> <p>She smiled again. "I know." She slipped the blouse off.</p> <p>"You look gorgeous." She said softly. "You were pretty cute back then."</p> <p>That was a lie. I was pretty decent looking. In my head, I'd looked too. I had a nice body. I just don't remember the real deal. Maybe my Mom, if she knew how to cook, would get me a better deal.</p> <p>"Your bra looks really niceâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
