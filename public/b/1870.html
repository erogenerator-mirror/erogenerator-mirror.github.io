I know it'll be difficult to do when I'm with him."</p> <p>"Not like that, not tonight."</p> <p>"What's there to think about in that?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'd like it to be you, David," he smiled. I rolled back, getting comfortable again.</p> <p>"You better rest up though," I said, and kissed him.</p> <p>He did and within a couple of minutes, I felt him moving inside me. It was a strange feeling. I found myself wishing I hadn't come when I left the room and didn't. I felt guilty about it then, I thought. But I thought when I heard him tell me what David had been thinking about how I had just made love to him, a second later, his fingers found me, so familiar, so delicious, so much like I had his penis inside me. My first orgasm, while still kind of vague, the first time we had sex, when we had been in bed together. God, that was awesome. It felt like I'd been on a sexual roller coaster before I came home, but it was far quicker then I thought it would be. I could feel it just as strongly now.</p> <p>He was gentle, too, not quite forcing his way in or out, just moving a little and then pulling back, as if testing his balance, and it didn't last very long. But then David got back to where he started and started his steady movements in and out, very gently now. It didn't hurt and I was glad that not a tear had fallen. I was too worried about getting into trouble because we were kissing and I got a sense he was loving what he was doing.</p> <p>"This feels so good."</p> <p>"Mmmm," I moaned. "You are so good. You feel like you've hit the jackpot." I rolled back onto one side.</p> <p>"I am not going to stop now, I'm sorry."</p> <p>"No, stop, please stop." I tried to lie very gently, my breathing was soft. "Don't do that," I whispered in a slow voice. "Don't stop."</p> <p>David stopped. He didn't move. He rested, his hands on my hips. My first thought was, 'Oh, Jesus, I wonder what he's doing.' I didn't have time to ask. I felt it coming. He kept moving inside me, I felt it coming. I couldn't believe it. It was incredible. There was little I could do but lie there, my feet on the bed, my knees drawn up to my chest, my hands tied as I was at the moment. It felt so right when I had just made love with another man, David.</p> <p>"There," he smiled, "that should teach you why I stopped. Did you lose your mind?"</p> <p>"Sorry," I heard myself say. I could feel him still hard inside me.</p> <p>"Did you?" David said.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Did you go in like that and come?"</p> <p>"Yeah. I guess, like that. I didn't want to make you feel so good, I was just nervous like you."</p> <p>I was lying to this point. "I'm happy where I am."</p> <p>"Thank you." he said, as his hands fell to my sides.</p> <p>I felt him slowly lift me from the bed. I wondered if we would end up doing that again or I could. I had no idea what to do or say about that.</p> <p>Instead, he said, "Your turn. I think I need to do that something for more than a minute." I watched as he climbed back up onto the bed and lay himself beside me. He kissed me then, like David had. His hand came down and felt my body, just caressing my skin, his fingers running over my skin. He seemed to know just how to touch me, how he had to touch me. I kissed him.</p> <p>"Did you find a way to get that?" he asked.</p> <p>"What do you mean?" I asked, confused.</p> <p>"Just lay there," he said, "and relax."</p> <p>I did as I was told and felt his hand touch me, feel my skin, his fingers and his skin against mine. I felt so relaxed that he could do that all night long.</p> <p>"David, you're making me feel that way," I gasped.</p> <p>"I couldn't help it," he answered, softly. My heart was pounding. He didn't say anything else. It seemed to me that we hadâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
