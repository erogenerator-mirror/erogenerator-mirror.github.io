She could feel the nipples hardening slightly. The warm wet feeling of her hand against her skin made her start rubbing herself back against my erection. She then started to lower herself slowly inching deeper inside of me. I stopped her, she sat down on my cock and leaned towards me.</p> <p>"That's so good you don't come inside me until I finish," she said.</p> <p>Her mouth enveloped mine kissing me with a kiss of passion and longing. I moved my hands into her hair and pulled her hard against me. My cock head was now in her depths, but I managed to control myself and keep her there with just a tease of movement. The wetness of her pussy on me as she slid down was driving me wild.</p> <p>I grabbed her tits in my hands. They were soft and firm. She groaned with pleasure. Her breathing was coming heavier as she moved back and forth against me. I could feel her wetness running down my thighs with each thrust. Her pace was changing the feeling between us.</p> <p>She was now riding me furiously, and I could feel the tightness of her vagina constricting around my cock as it drove the last of my cum in.</p> <p>My muscles tensed. I felt myself go into spasms in her, pushing her to a second orgasm. She collapsed on me. I was still in her. I felt her breathing change in frequency and the muscles of her pussy contract around my cock. My cock spasmed and shot spurt after spurt of cum into her pussy.</p> <p>She broke our contact. I slid out of her pussy, and fell on her bed naked. She pulled me to her and we kissed. I was spent.</p> <p>"I've never done anything like that before," she said.</p> <p>I felt no guilt or shame. I just lay there watching her, wondering if it would ever happen againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
