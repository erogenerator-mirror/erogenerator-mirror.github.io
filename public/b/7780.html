I was being honest and she knew it.</p> <p>"It'll kind of hurt him. I'll even feel a little better, not as much I thought it was going to."</p> <p>She looked at me and started laughing. Now I was smiling and it felt good. "I'll make sure he understands that. The two of us aren't doing anything but the two of us, so how would it really hurt him to know how much we are really enjoying each other, having so many sex in every hole, even if that hole is filled completely with someone else's cock. You're so beautiful and I want you every day."</p> <p>"And I want you to know that everything you do with me just isn't for everyone, or you for making love to me. You make me happier than I'm ever likely to be."</p> <p>"Thank you."</p> <p>"Well, if you don't want me to stop I'll understand."</p> <p>"No, thank you." She smiled. "It really did feel good, and I'm very glad you enjoyed it."</p> <p>We said our goodbyes and I got into my car and started my business. I'd had a little wine and it was time to celebrate. The wine was getting to me and I'd definitely need my sleep.</p> <p>The next day was Saturday and I'd been staying over at her apartment over the last eight months. She was really happy about me spending the weekend with her, but I still needed some time to recover and recover again if my luck ran out. She'd been a good sport to get me out of the habit, but I would have kept my word if she'd had another lover. She didn't want to lose me when I got too full. Her friends were going to see the tape, but she'd told me she'd make sure my job and my sex life wasn't interfered with.</p> <p>The sex tape of last Saturday was in the envelope with the letter "L" in the middle of it. I pulled the envelope from my pocket and held it up, just to be sure. I had to feel her hand on my cock one moment, and now I held a copy of the letter to be certain she knew just what her hand was doing. It was a long letter from the woman who'd fucked me last Saturday, I think it said "L" but that didn't make sense, even if it had come from her as the letter read:</p> <p>Jack,</p> <p>I'm so glad you did me back on Sunday. I want to tell you in detail just how much and what it felt like. I want you to see it and remember it, OK? Oh, it still hurts, but I'll tell you, I got to admit that it really does feel good a lot. I hope you're not offended but I really wanted to tell you this. If it turns you on that much, then it's OK. Just think about it. You see, that letter really did make a lot of difference. I hope you have enjoyed yourself. I've been thinking about last Saturday but I was planning on taking things slow. It was my first time, so please don't be disappointed.</p> <p>That's pretty much all I've got, so now I need to read it again and see if I liked it or not. Thank you!</p> <p>You might want to read the letter, before you decide whether you want to stay here forever. The rest will come later, I'm enjoying the weekend much.</p> <p>-Sharon,</p> <p>I think you and I will get along just fine again anyway. I didn't realize before, but I might want to tell you about a couple times a week for at least a year. The girls you've been with this weekend were friends of ours, and they're going to be friends of ours very soon. I'd like to know what you want to do.</p> <p>All the girls that you've been with since we became friends are going to want to have time with one of us or both. We can do that every other weekend when things settle down between you and me.</p> <p>-Sharon</p> <p>I read the letter again and thought it was kind of hilarious. "So I guess I should give you some time. It may help you decide if it's been good or not." I had to admit that maybe I enjoyed it as much as she did. I had to go to work and get another appointment. I also wanted to make sure I didn't do something to embarrass or destroy my life or what might come later.</p> <p>I had to drive down to the address she gave me and drive it down to the address and get my apartment key. It was the one time I'd ever been able to drive to work in my old carâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
