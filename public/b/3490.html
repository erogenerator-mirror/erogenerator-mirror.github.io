We'll see."</p> <p>By the time she had her way around the apartment, he was already at her bedroom just in time to kiss her. What, was that some sort of signal? It did not turn out to be a signal of seduction, because when he went to her door, as if a string, the light had come on. He quickly put on his shirt and shorts, and, naked as she was, he went to it.</p> <p>When he went in, his eyes followed her, so close that he could smell her. She was sitting on the edge of her bed, wearing only an old T-shirt, her legs parted, and her fingers were busy between them.</p> <p>She was still dressed.</p> <p>"Hey, come in, come in and lay down on the bed," he said.</p> <p>He stood at the top of the bed, looking at her. It occurred to her that perhaps he was actually interested in her, to touch her, to take her from behind. Perhaps she had been expecting an encounter, a sexual encounter. Surely that was a relationship. Was it? Not likely it was, and maybe, just maybe it was because she was with somebody? No, but if what she had assumed was a relationship, that wasn't fair, since neither of them was actually married, and had not been intimate as a couple.</p> <p>She smiled. "Thank you, I hope it was nothing like the kiss you gave, and then the one you gave at the door. I think I might have liked it better if you had kissed me. I didn't think your mouth would go so well with a girl's tongue."</p> <p>A sudden look in her eyes and she jumped up and kissed him. They were more intense, firmer, and more urgent. He held back, and, after a while, she came. There was a sudden intake of breath from her and some movement of her hips. In answer to this, she was pulling away from him, and he quickly went to the bathroom for something to cool himself off.</p> <p>"I was looking at the mirror. It looked like something you should be looking at. Do you like it? Do you want it? You have the right to ask."</p> <p>He stood at the edge of the bed, looking at her, his hands still on the mattress, his hips forward and his penis straight, with a slight curve to it.</p> <p>He waited for her to answer.</p> <p>She took a step toward him. "Do you want to take all your clothes off now?"</p> <p>His answer was to stand naked next to her.</p> <p>As she had been, she seemed less embarrassed, the way she had done with the other day. More nervous than anything, but also more than anything. In fact, he found himself feeling a little afraid, at least from him.</p> <p>"Okay," she said. "But I want you to fuck me. Go slowly, but don't hurry. When you're ready go slowly because I'm not sure I want that thing in me. I want your kisses and touches, the attention I get from you because I'm willing and you want it. I don't either."</p> <p>This time he felt the need to move. Even if she said it would be a sexual experience, he wouldn't give up his clothes if she said it would be, too.</p> <p>He undressed himself, stepping out of his clothes, while she sat on her side of the bed, one hand on the small of his back and the other rubbing his penis.</p> <p>He lowered himself on top of her, and he could feel himself rising up and down in her. He did not care if it hurt his eyes, the pain would be more, and he would be embarrassed, but the arousal that they were both feeling seemed to be getting greater; he wanted more, and to be sure, he wanted it more, so that it would happen, so that it lasted long, and to give her pleasure at the same time so that all things became part of the act, that both were pleasuring the other, and that they had no control over the other.</p> <p>He knew that the feelings he experienced had to be better than what he had been getting the last couple of days by kissing her. She seemed much more experienced and eager than she had been when he first kissed her, and he was afraid that, though the experience was good, it would be a lot different. There would be little of it. At least not to this degree.</p> <p>He wanted to say it, he wanted to be able to look into her eyes, to be able to feel the intensity, the pleasure, and the love and love that he found in her eyes. But he couldn't say it either.</p> <p>So, instead of asking for more, he started moving again slowly and gently up and down, pressing gently, sliding in and out of her, feeling her breasts rubbingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
