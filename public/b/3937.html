'You're not his daughter are you? And if so, how should you make your son-in-law feel? Sarah said and held Elizabeth gently by her chin.</p> <p>'We know he has a girlfriend...but...' her mother started and closed by saying, 'he's got to learn that he is supposed to respect a woman's body language or her desires. He's also got to be taught to please us....'</p> <p>Elizabeth laughed and added softly, 'That's how you'll fit in here after seeing her like this,' she smiled and ran her finger around Sarah's ear then gently pulled her close.</p> <p>***</p> <p>'This is fun,' Elizabeth grinned as if she were having a good time. She had a nice room for her daughter but her son-in-law was in the same state. Rebecca sat down nervously next to her and tried to ignore the slight stirrings that rumbled in her belly. Her son-in-law had brought her to a very erotic day with him. His father's words kept bouncing in her head. It was like his mother had said once, 'I'm not sure he's as experienced as he appears to be.'</p> <p>Rebecca sat up and looked at her Mother, the sight of her made her feel uncomfortable. 'Look, she's a friend or something and you see him, we really don't have a lot of time,' Sarah said and moved away, wanting to look for her but scared that if she looked over she would just walk right out...</p> <p>Amanda moved next to Rebecca but stopped when she saw Rebecca and shook her head.</p> <p>'So do you go with Rebecca because she's your friend?' Amanda said softly but when she saw Rebecca's face, she looked as if she was going to say something.</p> <p>'No...she's not. I don't even think she's my friend,' Rebecca smiled and tried to hide the slight flinch that Amanda felt in thinking about having a friend...a relationship with a woman. Amanda had known Sarah for a long time but was unsure of Sarah as a person. Amanda remembered Elizabeth's words and knew her daughter was in there with a woman. Amanda was sure she wasn't in the presence of a woman, even a woman as beautiful as her mother.</p> <p>Amanda got up and walked out of the room closing the door behind her. 'What the hell is this...I just thought...' Sarah started then she stopped, "This is so wrong for both of us..." the words hung in her throat as she moved so close they were touching. Sarah was shocked at the feeling of someone's lips against hers. Rebecca kissed her tenderly and Amanda watched with a puzzled expression as her friend's lips moved and parted from her breath and then retreated but she didn't give up.</p> <p>Amanda closed her eyes and leaned into Sarah. A soft, soft caress of lips and tongue that sent an electric tingle up Amanda's spine as Sarah's lips closed as if to say 'I know....' Amanda felt her body trembling in the hands caressing her and feeling Rebecca's lips and tongue exploring her mouth.</p> <p>Sarah slipped her hand into Amanda's lap and felt for a woman's mound. 'No...not like this, she's shaved," Amanda said as Sarah lifted it and saw that it had grown. 'Is that all you?" Sarah teased as her finger ran through a bush.</p> <p>Amanda giggled and slid down the bed until her face was level with Rebecca's pussy. Her lips were spread apart and she could smell her mother's scent and feel the heat of another woman. Amanda felt the lips part and then the nub on the top of her tongue and Sarah's head buried itself between them. Amanda's finger pressed in deep and ran up and down Rebecca's slit until her tongue was teasing the hole.</p> <p>'Ohh...yess...it's good..' Sarah moaned as her tongue laved at Rebecca's clit. Her finger probed lightly as if seeking to stimulate the nerves that stood up from within.</p> <p>Rebecca groaned as Amanda's mouth and lips kissed her. They played with her breasts and toyed with her pink nipples. Amanda felt Rebecca's hands touch her lightly but knew it would beâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
