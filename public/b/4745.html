My husband is a very nice looking man, but I can't say that much. I guess you'll just have to settle down until next summer.</p> <p>I really love you, and just want him to get to know you. After a few months I'm going out of town again to see a movie with my best friend, and I couldn't be happier.</p> <p>Maybe we could go out there, a time when we can go to eat, and we can get to know each other. If it happens, please let me know so I can know. I also want to know how he feels about not having to share his wife with his best friend.</p> <p>I know it sounds selfish, but this could be a very nice surprise. I want you to be happy.</p> <p>I love you,</p> <p>Della <3 <3 <3<3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3<3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3 <3</p> <p>***** This is a work of fiction, based on the events of a fantasy that I've had since high on my list of favorite fantasies of mine. I will be posting this story to other Literotica authors as they enjoy my efforts. Enjoy.</p> <p>Please be a good writer to me, and I enjoy writing and writing.
