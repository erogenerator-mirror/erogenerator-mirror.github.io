The next thing I knew, two large cocks were at my mouth. I eagerly sucked, licked, and stroked them. I could feel the tension in the muscles of their shafts in every direction. I wanted them to cum together. They did, and we both could feel their juices running down my throat.</p> <p>"Mmm....that's right." They both said to that. "And you won't be able to last very long when you get to cum again."</p> <p>I couldn't wait any longer. I turned from the cock sucking and went down on him. My eyes never left Mike. I knew it was making him hotter, but I wanted to feel that as well. I continued as Mike reached down and found my hairless mound. First I felt his fingers, as I was already so wet. He stroked my lips, and then let his finger enter me. I could feel the tension building in his cock. He could tell I was ready so he pushed his finger in. It made me shudder and his cock pulsed, hot cum shooting out, deep into my throat. I swallowed it all. Finally he pulled his finger out, and stood quickly.</p> <p>"Well, that's not what I started with....that was just to be a snack." I took a towel to clean them both up a bit as they both tried to look into my eyes for an explanation.</p> <p>"Just so you know, that was nothing. I just meant to get a quick rub down here before you guys left. You were in control today."</p> <p>Mike smiled at me as he started to walk off. "What was your name?" I asked as I took his hand.</p> <p>"John," he replied. I gave him one of my own hands and led him up to the bedroom.</p> <p>"It's just me." We said together as I closed the door.</p> <p>"You don't have to. I'm not going anywhere." I smiled and took his hand and led him inside the room. We fell onto my bed and started to make out. After I was ready to do more we talked about how we had gotten so far in our friendship. I had felt the same way for him.</p> <p>"Do you want to do this more often?" I asked.</p> <p>"If the opportunity arises, do....well....go for it." I added.</p> <p>"I have missed you..." he said while kissing me on my neck.</p> <p>"I love you and....you're so sweet!" I said as he started to kiss my chest gently. "Do you?"</p> <p>"Yes I do. Now take off those heels that we just got out of the bathtub." I asked as he took them off completely. I started to kiss his lips as he moved his hand away from my breasts and began to kiss and lick them. I was wet to the point that it didn't take very long for him to start to use his fingers instead of his cock. I let my hands trail down his chest and over the rest of him till they reached his cock. I stroked, and he moaned. I looked up at him and saw him pulling on the leash. He had moved to straddle the foot of the bed. I saw him undo the buckle of his slacks and reached in for something that I did not see before.</p> <p>I sat on the foot of the bed and slowly started to take off his pants. I was hoping he could take off my heels again. They were just too soft. I looked up at him. His eyes were closed and he was trying to keep himself from moaning as I reached under and rubbed the heels. I could not believe how incredible they felt. He opened his eyes and looked at me. His cock was already pushing against his slacks. He smiled and reached under, pulling the shoes off. I smiled back. As he stood, he stood there completely naked for my eyes. He was beautiful. His face was handsome. His six-pack abs were strong and as he moved, his arms and his thighs, his thighs, and his cock, I could see it pulsated, and the hair on it thickening up. I leaned forward and kissed his nose then his lips. It was a strange taste to kiss; almost salty. As the kiss ended, we both started to get up again.</p> <p>We had gotten to my feet so I wanted to walk but I wanted to stay down there for a moment. I wanted to feel so much more than just feet in the tub. I felt him behind me as he pulled on the leash. He turned me around and I looked up at his beautiful eyes as he bent me over the foot of the bed. He grabbed the back of the leather straps and snapped them together and then pulled my hips up and out.
