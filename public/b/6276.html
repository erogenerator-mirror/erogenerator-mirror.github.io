I didn't see his eyes roaming the interior. I looked around the living room and then at the TV. It was a huge screen of sports, and I could tell from his face that he was getting excited to watch one of those, too. The way he was standing there, he looked like he was about to go wild. Then he looked away from the TV and then back at me.</p> <p>"You want to come in?"</p> <p>"Sure. Give me a second and I'll be out in a while."</p> <p>"Oh," he said as he went back in the front room, "you look pretty hot in that outfit."</p> <p>I could feel myself flush as I thought about how he had pulled this off. I wanted to say something; anything.</p> <p>He went back into the room and came back with a small cooler and a bottle of wine. "I'd like a couple glasses if you're interested."</p> <p>I looked out the living room as we were all still naked sitting around the couch. He turned back to me just as I was going to turn and take a drink of wine. "You're sure this isn't a bad idea?" I asked as I took another sip.</p> <p>He said, "You bet your pretty little ass I'm not. If you want me, just come on in anyway you want to."</p> <p>I felt my heart jump. My stomach churned at seeing him like this, just sitting there. I took a deep breath and took a swig of my wine. "Sure," I said.</p> <p>We sat down on the couch together. He had a glass of wine for me as well, and I felt warm and flirty and happy.</p> <p>"So," he said as he sat down on the couch next to me, "you have a little time before you have to go home tomorrow."</p> <p>"I told you I'd do anything that made me feel the way I was feeling. I'm very excited," I said.</p> <p>"That's good," he said. "I can tell. Do you have any more questions?"</p> <p>"Not really."</p> <p>"Do you have any friends," he asked as he smiled at me.</p> <p>"You know me, right?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I know you. Do I have anything to hide," he said.</p> <p>"Well, yes, but ..."</p> <p>"I'm not trying to be an ass."</p> <p>I sat there, my head in my hand. How could I even talk to him? I couldn't even think about going back inside. I was suddenly afraid; afraid that I would end up at the bottom of the rabbit hole.</p> <p>I leaned back against the couch, trying to calm the nervousness. I was feeling kind of silly and had a feeling I never could be for people would treat me the way I'd felt.</p> <p>"So," he continued, "what do you do with your days off, any assignments that you want?"</p> <p>So I told him, and he seemed to read my mind. "I love to eat pussy. That's what I'm afraid I wouldn't get to experience," he said.</p> <p>"I take it you like giving blowjobs," he said. I felt nervous again at his answer, but there was no stopping him from asking anything next. I just sat there looking past him out the window and feeling like a child waiting in the principal's office to be spanked for being a naughty girl.</p> <p>He leaned back with his hand to his cheek. "Didn't have too bad a chance to blow me," he said. "I want that cock of yours when we get home."</p> <p>We both looked over at one another as he stood up. I'm not sure what he was alluding to, but I couldn't take my eyes off what he had in his hands. He started to unbutton his shirt, which I guessed to be a new outfit for the day, and as he took his shirt off, he pulled his hands up until they were over his head and started to slide his shoes off, too.</p> <p>I was dying to see what he had under that shirt. Just then, I heard a knock at the door. I turned around to see who it was.</p> <p>"Is that your friend, Greg?"</p> <p>"Hey," I said. That's one hell of a greeting. There was no doubt we were friends. I'd already decided I wanted to hook up with him. I wanted him to be my first.</p> <p>I thought it would be weird to bring someone home to have sex with. Then again, why not. But I couldn't stand looking back.</p> <p>A few seconds later, our eyes met again in the room.
