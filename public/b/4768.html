I picked up the pack, "You need to stay there." With that I turned around and walked around the room, taking in the beautiful decorations and the many pieces of art still hanging from different pieces in racks, "Are these really going to fit or is there no space anywhere?"</p> <p>"This is all for you, honey," Bethany responded before leaving the room, "I will meet you in my office." As she was gathering up the rest for me I could not help but wonder what she looked like as she walked through my house and office. With that she was out of my sight again and in a few minutes I followed her in behind her, "Is everything ready?" I asked when we entered my office where she closed the door and locked it.</p> <p>The office was as beautiful as I'd imagined and was set up and already filled with my new collection of her pieces. The door hung open and I stood in one side, her and the wall behind and to my left was my new love's beautiful desk. Bethany sat at it and the desk was in perfect condition. The desk itself was covered in the highest quality black and white silk that I had been able to find, but the rest of the desk was an exact replica of a black velvet sofa placed against the wall by a large, oak chandelier above. Sitting on the coffee table were dozens of small photos of me and my girlfriend.</p> <p>Behind the couch were two chairs and a small table held several more small photo albums that made the couch more comfy to sit on. On the table sat a small square coffee table. On top of those were a few pieces of the photos I took of her in various states of dress or undress, although I could not remember the last time I sat out of all of them.</p> <p>Bethany began to remove the rest of my clothes from the closet and the smell of feminine undressing overwhelmed me. I leaned back in one of the chairs and began to touch the sides of my body as she stood in front of me. She took her time undoing her buttons over and over and I found myself looking at her breasts hanging freely, jiggling and teasing me with every movement. She slowly pushed my shirt out of the way and began to unbutton her pants, slowly pulling the pants down her thighs until she could slide the pants off and hang over the end of the chair. She sat back in one of the chairs and I was amazed as she stood up in front of me in just her panties and her socks. She took me in her arms and kissed me, pushing my face between her lips, I ran my hands up and down her sides and then under her sweater. She lifted her arms and let me caress her body, her breast were now so young and beautiful. I could feel her nipples growing hard under my fingers and when she pulled back she told me to take off her bra and kiss and tease her breasts.</p> <p>"My lover would be here in a few minutes, honey." She gently removed my shirt and she helped me with the rest of my clothes before taking me back to my room and locking me in. Bethany and I kissed again more passionately, taking pleasure in the taste of her mouth, when she broke the kiss, she kissed me deep on my lips then took a tissue and wiped her face and hands. "I told you that I wouldn't forget this week." She grinned as she blew me a kiss. "Good," she patted her lap, "You are beautiful. I thought you might enjoy it here."</p> <p>And with that she sat straight up again and unbuttoned her pants letting them fall open as she removed her panties. She sat her naked body on my lap and then I took her face in my hands as she spread her legs as wide as they would stretch and I kissed her there, slowly licking up her moist flesh until she was moaning with pleasure.</p> <p>"I love to feel you touch me," she cooed, "Please, make love to me." She laid back on the bed and I knelt between her legs and placed his hands on her thighs and gently took each of her legs between my fingers and began to slide them up and down her body. When I was almost back to the middle of her thighs when I could tell she was close to that beautiful explosion I continued to lick and kiss and nibble everywhere I could. I could not resist reaching up between her legs and teasing her clit with my fingertips and sucking in her swollen lips as I moved them back and forth.</p> <p>Bethany's moans got louder as I brought her toward her first orgasm and then suddenly stopped all movement and lay sprawled across the bed and her legs opened for me. "I love that." She moaned, "Oh, god, yes..." I took my hands from her thighs and took her hands and placed them on her breasts and began to knead and play with her nipplesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
