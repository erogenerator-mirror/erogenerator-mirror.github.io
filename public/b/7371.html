I was sure everything was going to be fine, but I guess I had to look a little longer. If it wasn't really what they wanted to happen then I may have to go change my mind. I quickly slipped my shirt back on and I stood up slowly.</p> <p>"Do we have to hurry or stay here?" Lisa said almost to herself.</p> <p>It's ok, I can get it back on."</p> <p>I put on my jeans and grabbed my phone. I didn't dare risk a call back over the phone, but I had to make sure I had what I needed. Once my phone was put on I realized this just might go farther than I planned on it being ok with her. I checked the time and decided to start working quickly, just before I knew it I was taking my phone out and starting to work again. When it was done I was going full speed again and got to work.</p> <p>I began with the back and began to work a double line of calls from my old number. After a while I was about to add another line of calls from another number but I stopped as I had forgotten the first. Now I knew why she hadn't made them after all. I began to type as I waited for it. When it arrived Lisa's phone started vibrating again. Her message read 'I'm so scared.'</p> <p>I typed, "Don't worry honey, he's the best guy to get things done with."</p> <p>The next one was sent.</p> <p>I quickly typed for her while I typed, "I'm so scared he's my best friend."</p> <p>I typed in 'What the hell?' and then sent the second line from her.</p> <p>I typed, "I'm so scared what if he is cheating on my wife."</p> <p>I took the phone back to my old number and sent.</p> <p>I could hear her laughing before I asked her what was wrong.</p> <p>She said, "Don't worry, I think he's going to have an affair with Kelly tomorrow."</p> <p>After a few seconds of silence I typed, "He is!"</p> <p>"Do you think he's cheating on Kelly tomorrow?" Lisa asked.</p> <p>"How could you know?"</p> <p>"Well, you're an attractive man."</p> <p>She replied, "I don't know, I guess I'm still trying to figure out what it is."</p> <p>"Lisa, I know it's bad to be with you but we have to stop him from cheating." I said.</p> <p>She took a deep breath and said, "I can't do that. I'm married and all, well, it's just wrong but I can't lose him, at least not for a while."</p> <p>I couldn't believe how close her mind was getting with the conversation with her friend. My cell rang again.</p> <p>"I've got another set of cell calls from Kelly."</p> <p>"What?" My wife asked</p> <p>"She's on the way so, we can talk later."</p> <p>"I really don't think that's a good idea."</p> <p>"I don't care," she said.</p> <p>"I don't think she's going to like that, not in a moment."</p> <p>Another breath of air came from her and she said, "She might even laugh at me. I don't think she could."</p> <p>I wasn't sure how that would go, knowing how much she had been looking forward all week to this meeting, to being able to tell him off to the group she was involved with.</p> <p>"Please let me talk to him," she begged, "please? Let him stop it."</p> <p>"I really don't see he'll even talk to you after what you did."</p> <p>"I told him to stop it."</p> <p>"But..."</p> <p>"Just call me and we'll talk later. You know how I feel. Kelly's on her way and we have to stop him."</p> <p>"I guess I already told you, he can't stop doing it, ok?"</p> <p>"I guess I'll try."</p> <p>I replied, "I'm sure he's going to think he's cheated on your wife, but not with his best friend either."</p> <p>"There's nothing wrong with Kelly, what's wrong with me."</p> <p>"I don't mean anything by it," I replied, "but you're not cheating on his best friend. You have to find out."</p> <p>"Ok, but please don't tell Kelly, it'll ruin everything."</p> <p>"We will talk when you get back, but I don't think you're going to like it."</p> <p>"Just tell him it's ok, heâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
