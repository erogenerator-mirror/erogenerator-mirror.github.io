I said I would meet him there. Once we arrived at the hotel room we quickly got dressed and headed over to meet him. We sat down at the table and he told me that we would have to pick out a few of his favorites. I told him I wanted more than his favorite from my table. He said it would take me a while as my mind was a bit more occupied with my thoughts. He gave his order for our drinks and we were soon down to having an excellent meal.</p> <p>He said he had brought a lot of paperwork but he would have to go back for them. He told us that he would meet us back in the suite and that he would join us for some coffee and a chat. We agreed to the plans to meet in the suite at 8 and after coffee I would pick him up at the hotel.</p> <p>When we arrived at the room we sat down to the coffee and talk. We laughed and talked about the conversation we had during the day. He told me that I was in a bad way of having some strange thoughts and then he told my that he would need my protection and I should never have. I blushed and nodded as I took his hand. "You have no protection on but it is a protection against any diseases. The last time I had sex was on the beach this morning where there was a pool full of people swimming and I found another man who fucked me before I got him home. I got a lot of pleasure from being fucked and was getting really excited to be doing it again. You are a man that I love. I want to keep you safe from getting diseases and you have to take care of that."</p> <p>"No worries honey. I'll be safe with you."</p> <p>"You don't love me and you know it. If I want the world to know who I am you better keep it to yourself."</p> <p>We chatted a little longer and then left the room. As promised the men had joined us and were laughing as each man got to know me. I was feeling really sexy now and asked him if I should continue with this tour. I told him to get it over with though and as he walked away to get back to work I walked over to him. As I kissed him there was a little more emotion in what I was saying. I told him that he was to make sure he was safe and he was. He just smiled saying he would take care of me just like he knew I wanted him to. Then he told me to take off my robe. The robe was almost transparent and he saw my nipples through it when I moved my hand. He told me to stand and put both hands behind my neck. He then started to tie the collar tie, so as you know I like to wear my hair up. My hair fell to between my shoulders and I stepped out of it. His hands began to caress my breasts and I could feel myself getting wet. I felt his hands on my bottom and then I felt his fingers on my pussy lips. Just as I was getting my first good grope of that day, he was between my legs and in no time he had his finger inside me. I looked down and saw his eyes focused on to my dripping wet hole. He had one of his middle finger going in and out as the other was pushing against my G-Spot. He told me to push hard against his finger and as I did so he was rubbing the little sensitive nub that sat inside me. The combination of what we are doing and my body's response to all this is having an effect on him. He then began to rub his finger more firmly across my clit and then faster inside my vagina. This really got me started and I began to rock against his finger. Then suddenly he pulled his finger from my pussy and took his wet finger out and rubbed it across my nipples again. As he did this I was starting to buck my hips. He told me to turn around. I did as I was told and he bent down and sucked and nibbled on one of my nipples as the other one he took to his mouth. As I pulled my mouth away from his, he told me to get on all fours and then get that vibrating dildo the one you brought to the room that you bought."</p> <p>He told me to hold the dildo in front of me while he took it in his hand and walked over and picked it up. He showed me the dildo in his hand and to turn it on. As he set it on, I put it on. As the vibrating dildo went into me, I could feel the waves of his words flowing through me. I closed my eyes and tilted my head back as the feeling of his body next to mine was incredible.
