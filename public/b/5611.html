"I'm sorry," she whispered. "If we don't end this soon, I'm going to feel stupid. I know it's wrong, I know it, we just..."</p> <p>"We?"</p> <p>She nodded and looked back at the ceiling again.</p> <p>"I love you," he said, feeling her eyes looking back at him.</p> <p>Tiffany didn't say a word. With his strong arms she melted into him.</p> <p>When Tiffany felt the tears run down her face, it was with such force and tears of happiness she opened her eyes.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she whispered.</p> <p>"That's ok, we can stop this," he said. "Now, I want to kiss you. Right now."</p> <p>Tiffany hesitated. Her mouth was still wet from their shared embrace and she still couldn't believe she said it. But her body responded instantly, a flood of pleasure swept through her, and within moments they were kissing violently, passionately, their tongues entwined, his mouth on hers, his hand on her breast. Her body began to respond to the kiss by making no protest. Tiffany's hand slid down his body, slipping between his powerful legs and onto his penis. His penis was long and hard. It felt as long and thick as her wrist and she had never felt anything like it. Her hand pulled up and down, sliding over his knob as it bobbed on and in her palm.</p> <p>"You're not circumcised, are you?"</p> <p>Tiffany didn't answer. Her hand moved over and around his crown as her other hand unbuttoned the pants and slid it over his thigh, pushing it down to his knees. She moved one knee between his legs and opened them wider before hooking the pants. Tiffany then pulled her body upwards and slid her legs so she could wrap them around his waist. She found his penis still firm enough that it looked like a tree trunk sliding up and down. She knew what was about to happen and she let her body go wild, wrapping her fingers around the root of his knob. Their flesh brushed and she felt his knob jerk slightly on her inner thigh as if it were a giant cock. The hand that had been fondling her boob now moved towards her vagina, pressing it with force. She didn't let go of his penis. His knob moved smoothly up and down her slit before going back down again. She had never felt anything like it before and her body became more aroused. There was no longer any resistance and his knob slid smoothly inside her soft vagina. Their groins slapped together as they both went on, feeling each others bodies.</p> <p>Tiffany was lost in total bliss as sensations of pleasure raced though her body and mind. Her mind was all on the moment now as she had never felt anything like it before. Pleasure raced through her and she felt him deep inside her. He stopped moving and Tiffany felt his penis as it began to slide inside of her again. His knob began to move back and forth, sliding in and out of her sopping pussy. His hand reached round to her vagina and he found it sopping wet and ready. He was in her pussy and she could feel her heart pounding faster and faster in her chest. Her head moved from side to side and she felt his hand caressing her breast even though her breast was covered.</p> <p>Tiffany felt the excitement building inside her and in her mind she could feel the orgasm building as soon as it crossed her body. It was fast and forceful and the only thought in her mind was giving in to what was being done to her but it didn't take long before a climax exploded across her body, its intensity growing with every spasm. When the orgasm washed over her mind she simply felt herself becoming completely limp in his arms. Her hands were still on his body; his penis was still inside her. Her body was still reacting to the feeling of his penis as his fingers played over it as it moved slowly in and out between her legs, as it rubbed against her lips.</p> <p>"How do you feel?" he asked.</p> <p>"Wonderful," she answered.</p> <p>Tiffany closed her eyes and laid her head on his chest. Her thoughts were of the love they experienced in the past and she couldn't describe it. She didn't see a future for them in love, just her time for pleasure. She was free, she was free, she was free! There was only one thing in her mind and that was that she was in him. She would say she was lost now, in his arms forever.</p> <p>**************</p> <p>In that brief moment the two lovers felt an immense peace.
