That was some good-looking black dude with dark hair, some white, and some white booty in a tight white sweater with those dark stripes of his on the front of 'that' leg. Did you enjoy the show?"</p> <p>"You don't get into this shit all the time, you know."</p> <p>"I didn't say anything about 'I don't get into it'. Did he put that shit on your body, do you know how he looked at it?"</p> <p>"Fuck you, Bitch. I do that a lot."</p> <p>"Hey, I don't like that. I'm not talking about some one that looks like you. Look, he's a tall, broad with an even broader chest, even in such a short shirt, so whatever floats your boat."</p> <p>"I don't like him. I've got three of those on a long ride. And I haven't even had a chance to get him off my cock in at least an hour." Then she grinned. "He's in good mind."</p> <p>I laughed and said, "That's why I'm calling you."</p> <p>"I know. I feel like I'm going to cry. He looks more like a man than you do, and he still likes me."</p> <p>"I think this lady has the better of you."</p> <p>I smiled and said, "I think so too. Why have you stopped calling me that, anyway?"</p> <p>"I wanted to see what he looked like, and he has some very nice legs. And maybe those nice thighs. We should get back to work, then."</p> <p>"I'll see you back at the lab. I don't feel like talking to anybody right now." We shook hands and I thanked her for speaking with the black lab technician. Then I realized how nice it would be to be with this lady again. "She's kind of cute."</p> <p>"Maybe. Maybe." I decided to take the next step and not be the only one who's said it. But not yet.</p> <p>***</p> <p>A few days later, about a week after Sam started his new job, the two of us sat on his bed naked. He reached back with his hand and caressed my thigh while I felt his thigh in my thigh. He was a good-looking man. He looked like someone who's always got a hardon, and I found myself wondering if he was, indeed, going to be any bigger when he walked. He had nice chest hair, which I noticed was very thick around his nipples. He was circumcised and was on the short side but his legs were long. He had the same thickness of a penis. It looked like a pair of testicles. I got aroused when I found out this was his first real penis.</p> <p>Samm saw my arousal and said, "Don't be shy. My pussy is wet. And I think a whole busload of women like me."</p> <p>"You'll have to be careful." I said.</p> <p>"Just kidding." Sam said. "It's just that they're all really nice."</p> <p>I thought. It wasn't as if I was a stranger to Sam who had enjoyed having his way with most of his female work colleagues; but to have a man with no experience in doing so, I felt that I should know how it feels to have a man with no experience also? Even though I was very close to Sam, I had not yet given in to any of his requests. It was going to be difficult.</p> <p>I saw that he was already stroking my thigh and my heart started to pound. I felt it move up my body with a pressure that I hadn't felt in a long time. I was a bit apprehensive about asking Sam to have sex with me. But I found myself wishing that Sam would. If he had asked to have intercourse with me in the ass, then I would have said yes, too.</p> <p>"What's it going to be, Bitch?"</p> <p>"Are you sure you want to go through with it?"</p> <p>"Not at all. This is the first time that I've had anything up my ass. And I'm not sure if it's going to be much of a turn-on for me. But I was really hoping that we could do this without having a condom on."</p> <p>Samm saw the apprehension in my eyes. "If you're sure, and that is all right with me, it won't hurt."</p> <p>"It wouldn't hurt, but you can do it."</p> <p>I was surprised at Sam's acceptance of this. But I felt that this was just right, because I had only just agreed with what he wanted, not what I thought I should have. And in spite of my doubts, what Sam offered me was very agreeable.</p> <p>Our first time together was about two weeks after that firstâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
