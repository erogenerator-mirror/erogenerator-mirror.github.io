I'm not disappointed.</p> <p>- Oh yes it's amazing!</p> <p>You lay down, and I straddle you. I slide down, my clit pressed against your swollen cock. I begin to grind with you, loving how it feels when you're inside me. You begin to move within me; taking control. I look over and see you're looking at me, and I smile. I begin to lick you up and down again, all over your gorgeous pecs. I pull them apart and lap at them like a kitten, gently sucking them into my mouth and feeling your hands on my head as I do.</p> <p>- Why haven't you done that before??</p> <p>- I didn't really know I had it in me. I have to admit I had to do something with my husband's cock... I have to learn how it's ever felt and feel in a man's body. I'm still very shy and shy, and my husband is very... strict. He makes things a lot more difficult for me when he comes home, but he won't ever force me on him. I've tried it once or twice on my husband to see if I can really do it, and it's so hard to tell how different he is compared to me. But once I did it, and he couldn't even keep his eyes off me, I got very excited, and I'm sure at that age people have to take it very seriously to do it. It's my husband's body part that keeps me going, and it's you's body part that makes me feel really sexy. I feel very powerful right now, being with you, pleasing you, having you inside me, making you feel good and safe... We were quiet for a while. I could tell you weren't anywhere near done with me, and I wasn't going to waste any of your time. A big grin spread across your face as you took me into your mouth and I responded. I ran my hands into your hair and caressed you, your body so strong and hard within mine... you are so fucking sexy! I was getting close to cumming, and knew it wouldn't be long. I ran my hands down your chest and felt the smooth skin on the outside of your thigh and I smiled and started to massage it. I wanted to take my time, and get this right. I was feeling naughty but I loved every second of it.</p> <p>I began to moan, and you immediately went up on top of me, and slid your hard cock inside me and began to thrust deep and hard. I could feel every muscle in your body tense and relax as you slid inside me. Your cock was so hot and hard against my body. I began to grind on your thigh, and you moaned in your throat as I felt you hardening and become thicker within my body. Oh you feel so big, deep, and sexy within me. The sensation is indescribable...</p> <p>- Ooh fuck me!</p> <p>I loved how you were hitting my cervix... I could feel you moving inside me as you came deep in my wet pussy. It was so hot and sexy. I felt so alive.</p> <p>- And I got so lucky!</p> <p>A small part of you thought you weren't going to make that choice but, well, you're here in my body now, so I might as well.</p> <p>- I bet you do!</p> <p>I loved how I was saying that to you... I couldn't wait! You were so sexy... your hair on me, your face in between my legs... I loved it!!</p> <p>I rolled over and we kissed again, then I felt you pulling a condom out of your briefcase. You're never nervous about sex, but when you see me wear a condom you feel awkward and uncertain about it.</p> <p>- I trust you.</p> <p>Once on you, you were no sooner to pull my lips down onto yours from the waist, and began to feel me up, the light touch of your lips as my tongue darted into your mouth. Your fingertips lightly caressed the outside of mine and I could feel myself tightening...</p> <p>- It feels so good in your hands.</p> <p>I loved feeling your skin against mine and hearing you moan when your arms wrapped around me. I could feel yours growing under my hands, and as I slid them up under the soft cotton of your clothes and then under your shirt I could feel your muscles tense, and it made me shiver with excitement. I leaned down and you took my face in your hands and we kissed again, while you slid the condom on your cock. I could feel you pressing against the outside of my hand, and I could smell your cologne as you slid yourself inside me, and felt the first throb of you as you thrust your hips into me.</p> <p>I leanedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
