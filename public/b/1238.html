His cock is about to push into me, so I lean forward, kissing him, nibbling his lips, his chest. He presses a button and we both gasp as electric shocks course through me and make my pussy clench.</p> <p>"Yeah, I knew it!" He says, "I knew it all along, like, you could be a porn star."</p> <p>I'm stunned to realize he's right. I couldn't have been. Instead, I've been a fantasy, a fantasy about to come true. I've wanted to do something like this since high school. This has to be wrong. But... my fantasies are my world no matter who I am with or how I feel about what they do to me. My body tenses as I let it go, the sensation of a huge cock in me is electric and so am it.</p> <p>I'm kissing him again, our tongues entwined, and then I'm sucking each of his nipples, which are even more delicious than I've ever remembered. God, it feels so good. We start fucking again, making out like old lovers for hours on end.</p> <p>"God, I'm gonna come, babe, I want to come all over you", I tell him.</p> <p>"Ugh, me too. I can tell", he says, and he's right, his breathing is rapid but quick. Just like that, I feel his cock swell and then pulse, I feel his hot jism shoot out and explode into me. I wrap my legs around his waist to pull him closer, not taking his cock out of me but instead kissing him all the way through, and I taste his pre-cum as it sprays my tongue.</p> <p>When we finally stop kissing, my legs slip back up around him, and he starts easing his cock back into me.</p> <p>"How was it?" He asks, his voice rough.</p> <p>"Wonderful", I say, "I don't give a shit."</p> <p>"So, what are you waiting for then? How about your ass?", he asks.</p> <p>"Yeah, that's really hot man", I say, trying to sound casual. I'm so used to being treated like some kind of sex object - with no real feelings to other women, and nothing to interest other men. We both just do it. But... I really don't think I want him to stop now.</p> <p>It takes nearly 30 seconds to get back to work.</p> <p>"Is it all finished?", he asks.</p> <p>"Yeah", I say "I don't think I broke anything. It's just really good."</p> <p>I slide my legs off of him and fall to my sides on the bed, propped up on my elbows. He follows, lying alongside me and caressing me. He slips his hand between my legs and is amazed as he finds that I was right about my sex being on fire - with a different kind of pressure every time he touches me.</p> <p>He climbs on top of me, his cock between us, and we start kissing again. I roll him on his back and he starts to kiss my legs as they press against his chest, and when he gets down to my knees, he kisses them as if it were a sacred duty.</p> <p>Eventually, he gets his hands between my legs to touch my pussy, but then he's lying between my legs, looking at me. He's naked and ready and I'm still dressed.</p> <p>"Are you ready?", he asks.</p> <p>"God, yes, you can see how hot you're making me." I answer, smiling.</p> <p>"You need to fuck me here."</p> <p>"I think getting back into it would be more comfortable", I say, "but we don't have all day."</p> <p>"We don't have all day." And he rolls over on his back, then looks down at me.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful", he says, "you feel amazing. I have wanted to do this for so long, but I never imagined I'd fuck someone like you - in your position, in some very sexy dress."</p> <p>"Do you have any fantasies?", I ask, surprised, and I'm surprised again. Oh, it's been a week, and I want to hear about this. I want to hear about fantasies that I never thought I'd have. Oh well, I'm glad to have been able to hold myself and not cum as soon as I had him.</p> <p>"Well, I guess I'm a little confused, but I have some fantasies a little different..." He says</p> <p>"Really", I say softly. "I don't need your fantasies to know that."</p> <p>"What?", he says. He's a little disappointed.</p> <p>"I want to have sex with someone that's real," I sayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
