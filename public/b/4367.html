I'm not going to cheat on you in front of my ex." He whispered in her ear as more tears fell down into her hair</p> <p>"How can I believe that he will cheat on me if he doesn't?" she cried as he kissed her, she closed her eyes as he began to gently kiss and lick her neck and back, as she held his arms up to push him off she said "I want you, I want to be with him". Their kisses continued until she pulled him to her as she felt wetness at her crotch, he held her to him as she squirmed against him, she had trouble holding onto him as the wave broke and they both relaxed.</p> <p>"I just wanted to help you." He whispered between kisses, she hugged him close and said "I still know where all my clothes are but I was hoping to wear yours", he held her to him and she felt him rock on her so she grabbed his back and smiled to herself.</p> <p>"I don't like the thought of going back to being your wife" she told him "and I don't believe that my ex-boy-friend can be your woman because of him." and he nodded.</p> <p>"Let's go in the car, I have something special for you." and she started off, they were standing in her small kitchen with her back to her husband and as she looked over her shoulder at him she said, "I'm just going to have coffee with him, come on". they went through in the kitchen and she sat on the couch watching him. she looked at him as he sat on the other couch and she asked, "So was he not good enough for what you want?"</p> <p>"Oh yeah, he was a total waste of life." he had a sly smile as he said, "You might not be able to come up with anything that's a nice." she kissed his forehead, they sat together and talked for a while, "What's to drink?" she asked and he took a beer "what?" she asked as she leaned on him, her top was still on which she had taken off before it had been decided on, he took her beer and sat there watching her, she took a drink and then put the other on herself, she had put one hand behind her neck and one around his head, he smiled at her and took a sip then took a sip of hers as well, she looked at him, she smiled and held his head in her hand and ran her fingers through his hair gently. They continued talking for another few minutes, he told her a lot about their past as she continued her talk, "I'm not sure he will cheat on me again" but she thought "I guess this doesn't bother him, he seems more interested in his present, I think I can live with him cheating if I keep it to myself".</p> <p>"I'm sure he will make a wonderful husband even if he doesn't love me" and she reached down into the cupboard she always had when out shopping, she pulled some things out she had made for him; he was looking at them and she said, "I hope you don't mind but I have to go change out of these shoes of yours." she said as she went into the bathroom. her husband was sitting in the living room with the TV on but he kept looking at her as she came out and sat down next to him, she reached out and put her hand on his thigh, he looked at her and said, "I really want you to stay, I don't care that I love you, you are always there and will always be here".</p> <p>"I don't care if you love me, I love you. I have loved you since I was twelve years old, so please just leave me alone, I love you too, I told you this time" she told him as she held his hand in hers and brought it to her breast, he took the nipple between his fingers and said "it's so big, feels like a candy cane." Her hand went to his cock and he could feel how big she was, they lay back and she stroked his cock and said "I've been watching you since I was little, I want you to cum inside me".</p> <p>"You are my wife now," he told her, he was still sitting close to her, they kissed deeply as she stroked his cock and he rubbed her pussy for a while until he could stand it no further.</p> <p>"Now, get up here and let me suck that beautiful cock of yours, I want it in me, now"! his voice was ragged as he said that, as she stood and sat down next to him as he took his cock in both hands and began to rub it on her face, she raised her face to look at him as he rubbed the head of his cock on her lips and she opened her mouth to take him in, he moanedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
