Emily stated.</p> <p>"Everyone, this is your favorite dance," Kelly said as she waved her hands in the air and walked over to where I was standing. I looked up into her eyes as she leaned over close and gave me a kiss. I could feel her warm breath on my ear as I put my hand on her knee. She let out a light laugh as I squeezed gently, my hand quickly moving up her thigh and under her skirt. Emily made an exaggerated squirming movement and I slid a finger inside her.</p> <p>Kelly and I smiled at each other and headed over at our destination. Emily grabbed the mic and started the music. There was nothing unusual about this part of our evening. I noticed that I had left my clothes in the kitchen with Kelly, so I walked over to the bar and poured myself a glass from the bottle in my back pocket. There was a slight buzz going through the speakers as I made my way to the dance floor. I grabbed a dance partner and started to dance. That was the last dance I ever gave Kelly before I left her. Her dance moves were very well received and I loved all the attention. Her eyes were closed as we danced, enjoying the music. Kelly and I danced several more songs which she quickly returned to the table. We laughed quietly to the songs, drinking the beer, having our own small talk. I noticed that Kelly leaned over to her friend and looked into her eyes. She pulled back briefly causing the girl to take a look, Kelly's arm was extended and she turned and gave the other girl a smile then disappeared. I turned to face Kelly who was still leaning over.</p> <p>"Don't be long," she said softly as her voice was sweet and her eyes were bright blue.</p> <p>The last song of the night, I have to admit, got her attention and a look of interest had passed across it. She smiled her sexy smile at me. I looked into her eyes as I saw concern in hers for the last song I didn't pay attention to. I took a small sip of my beer before I moved away from her. I looked at her as we both sat back down, sipping our beers.</p> <p>"I think I'd better go now," she said as she adjusted her skirt while reaching over to grab a napkin from the table next to her.</p> <p>I made my way towards the door, my face reddening. Just then, the music started again but this time it was a slower song coming from the speakers. Kelly and I walked over to the bar to have another drink as I returned. She handed me another napkin to cover my eyes and smiled as I looked at her. Her lips were parted and her eyes were looking straight at me. I took the napkin in my hand and wiped my eyes. "I hope you won't mind if I stay a bit longer tonight, it's been a while.</p> <p>"Of course I won't mind, it's been a while," she smiled. "I wouldn't normally leave my home that early, let alone go out and have a few drinks tonight."</p> <p>She looked into my eyes with a question in them as she asked. "Are you sure about this?"</p> <p>"I think so," I said with a smile, "I don't really know what to say so I'm honest with you. If things go the way you expect them to go," she said with a kiss before closing the bar and leaving. We walked to our cars as I drove in silence, knowing that I had just gone through an amazing evening. The night was just coming to an end and I needed to get home.</p> <p>It had been a while since anyone had asked me. My last girlfriend had left before I did. Although I didn't remember the details in my life, I knew the reason behind it. We had been seeing each other for a while. It had started a couple of months before and had taken on an urgency. It had been so special, having a woman with a body like hers, no experience in bed, nothing. My eyes had kept glancing at her whenever I could, but I kept those thoughts to myself. And the time has come for me to ask her out. But first I had to do something.</p> <p>I got into my car and drove out of town, stopping at the motel to have a drink, thinking about our conversations. I think I knew her because I would say her name and then I would tell her. I pulled into the motel, turned on my GPS and pulled into the parking lot of the house. As I got out of my truck, I realized that I needed toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
