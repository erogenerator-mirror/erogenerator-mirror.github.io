I asked.</p> <p>"Oh yes!" she replied, her eyes wide.</p> <p>A big gob of spit dropped from one eye. It dripped to the next, making her big nipples jiggle. I reached underneath to rub it up and down her back and ass. Then I cupped both cheeks to feel for any moisture. I found the spot where they meet. The slick, glistening muscle made it all the more obvious as it became coated in my spit.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah, baby, that feels good. Do that again." Her voice was breathless, "I'm ready, let's do it! I want to feel you in my ass."</p> <p>It certainly did feel good to me, and I could feel the heat of our bodies pushing against each other, moving together in the narrow confines of the car. As I pressed one hand against her clit, my thrusts began getting a little faster. I had to admit that it was more than I could ever do by myself. I felt a rush of electricity shoot through me as her ass spasmed on my cock.</p> <p>"I love doing this, baby." She gasped, squeezing my cock with her hand tightly. "It feels so good! Oh, God, I'm going to cum. Get in me while I cum! Do it! Right in my ass! I feel it, it's so good. Right in my ass! Cum in my ass, lover, let it go!"</p> <p>"I want you to feel it, baby," I whispered.</p> <p>"Are you, you want me to cum in your ass?"</p> <p>"What?" I asked, alarmed.</p> <p>"Don't ask." "What do you mean?"</p> <p>"I meant, what's your other fantasy about it?"</p> <p>"A little bit, I guess."</p> <p>"A lot?" I tried to gauge her response.</p> <p>"Yes, sometimes, too many to count. But I want to feel you in me so much, that I've thought about it. Do you think about the way a cock can fill your little ass? Do you love the way you fill a man's ass?"</p> <p>"A lot?"</p> <p>"And it's a little bit different."</p> <p>"It's so hard to describe."</p> <p>"It might be harder," she added. "If you're uncomfortable. You might like it too much, you might even like it a little, but sometimes I can't decide. I can always tell when it looks like it will hurt. It can be kind of fun for a man or a woman."</p> <p>"Oh, I'll think of something," I whispered.</p> <p>This time, her words were all I needed. I pushed in as far as I could, and shot my load all the way into her.</p> <p>"Oh, you did it, didn't you?" she sighed happily as I slowly pulled my cock out of her ass.</p> <p>"I told you, didn't I?" I smiled.</p> <p>"You told me all the time you didn't have room to have sex with me," I told her. "Just let me put it away so we can make love."</p> <p>We sat there for a long time while just holding each other. One thing she whispered to me was something very soft and private:</p> <p>"I know it hurts sometimes, but not as much as you do. It's sort of a feeling that comes over me, being like that. I just really want more than that. I've wanted you for a long time."</p> <p>"I've got a lot more," I told her. "I hope you understand. I can only wish that you were willing to share that knowledge with me."</p> <p>She touched my face and kissed me softly. "If you're really good when you do it, I'll think about it."</p> <p>I drove to the apartment. There was little in the way of food and beer, but I had beer and wine and had a bottle of bourbon for a nightcap. Neither of us drank hard liquor. We'd had good sex before, but neither of us had had alcohol before. But this was special. I thought about the night's events the whole way, the way I had enjoyed her body, and how good it was to have her like that.</p> <p>I picked up a little bottle and threw it into the garbage disposal bag. We sat, holding each other. I thought of her long legs. She was so slender, her slender figure stretched over me, her waist, a flat tummy, her full breasts and puffy nipples pressingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
