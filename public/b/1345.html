While I entered the office, I could hear a low buzzing. It could be one of the other employees' computers and it could be mine. It sounded like it was connected to the main computer on the wall. I moved around a bit and saw that the monitor had a large video screen, so I pushed an intercom button and entered. I could already hear the monitor whirring with the keypad. I walked up to the monitor and saw that one of the screens was a video feed. I pressed a couple of buttons and a second of screen went up on screen. I thought for a moment that maybe some of Steve's things weren't really what I had expected, but then she came in wearing a dark blue cocktail dress and high heels. I had no idea if she had a bra on after she came in, but she was wearing a little white silk thong that showed a fair amount of her ass.</p> <p>She smiled back at me as I came in. She looked so beautiful.</p> <p>"Where is Steve?" she asked, looking over her shoulder at me.</p> <p>"Oh, he's in his office," I quickly replied. "I didn't see anyone else here."</p> <p>"Oh, I didn't see him, I just finished off the bottle," she said with a cheeky grin. "I didn't think anybody else was here."</p> <p>"Well," I said smilingly, "I don't normally drink like that but that's what I normally do."</p> <p>"Oh," she said suddenly and looked at me again, "Really? I thought you didn't like to do that."</p> <p>"I like to do it when I get a woman horny, not when I go down on her," I answered, taking out a small bottle of lubricant from my desk and laying it on the desk. "I really don't dislike it and I really like the taste," I added. "Would you be a dear and get me a pen and paper?"</p> <p>"Sure," she responded. "What are they?"</p> <p>"Papers."</p> <p>"What?" she asked suspiciously.</p> <p>"Here," I said as I handed her one of the pens, "and you can write your name down on these." I showed her my hands and then took the condom from my desk drawer, "If you'd like me to wear it to you instead of the vibrator with a cock that it would hurt when it's in you."</p> <p>"But I'm not sure that's necessary," she said, her eyes widened.</p> <p>"Sure it's necessary," I said smiling, "but I'm not sure no one's ever worn that thing before."</p> <p>"Oh, is that so?" she asked.</p> <p>"Well, it's a special kind of condom that you know that doesn't hurt," I replied, rolling it onto her.</p> <p>"That's a surprise," she said with a big smile. I could not tell if she was embarrassed at the prospect of something she had always wanted to do, but I was not about to complain. "I'm actually a little nervous about that," she said somewhat sheepishly.</p> <p>"Don't worry about it too much, Lisa," I answered. "We're both adults here and I've seen enough porn to know what men like." I took her hand and we returned to our desks. I leaned over and gently kissed her on the cheek, then gently rubbed her arm for a brief moment before turning away and standing up. "I think you better put some work on," I said.</p> <p>"Yeah, it's almost closing time," she agreed.</p> <p>"Good," I smiled, "Then take care of yourself and your desk."</p> <p>"Will do." As I went into the ladies room, a large black man entered the office and started walking down the hallway as soon as we finished talking. He was a big man, wearing a dark suit that showed off his muscular chest and a tight t-shirt. But there was something else about him that made me really wish he was in this office. I took a deep breath and walked out the employee side door.</p> <p>"That was a surprise," I said as my boss walked back in. I leaned into her as she closed her door and turned me into her arms.</p> <p>"Thank you, Steve," she said softly.</p> <p>"I'm glad you were satisfied by the taste of that wine," I remarked, "because you could come back in a few minutes and help me finish my work. Then I'll come and show you the ropes."</p> <p>"I guess that's a good idea," she smiled.
