For the first few seconds all three of us froze as his fingers flicked my nipple painfully. As his breathing grew more ragged he let go and I fell into his arms as the kiss was broken. With a smile he held my hands and helped me down to my knees. His lips were cool and his hands felt fantastic on my flesh. "You're gorgeous," he mumbled against my neck as I turned to my side so that he could lick my face. "I should taste your lips after tonight," he added, lifting up on one hip and kissing down my neck into my cleavage. I groaned as my nipples rose and touched his lips. A low growl came out, and I could feel his hardness through his jeans. The head of his cock found a way into my mouth and I sucked eagerly. Before long he was fucking my face with a reckless abandon. I moaned, and I wanted to be fucked again.</p> <p>"Do you like it rough?" he asked, nipping my neck with one long lick. The sound came out thick and almost strangled. I nodded, my lips quivering as his fingers dug deeper into my chest and pinched my nipples. Slowly I pushed back against him, my legs opening for him, making his cock slide between us. "I want you," I moaned, "Fuck me." As we both heard my ragged words, he leaned down to kiss me again, his breath hot against my cheek. As that heat spread through me I came around him, wanting more. With a deep groan he pressed himself deeper into me, his hips pressing into my ass each time. I could hear my heartbeat accelerate, and suddenly I was crying out. "Yes! Yes!" I screamed, and he took me in his arms and started rocking his cock into my mouth. I'd never felt anything like the sensations exploding from my cock as he started riding me, my juices flowing like a river. And just when I felt the wave building to the edge, he stopped. Slowly my legs shook, and my whole body ached. And when I calmed, we were both panting so hard I worried I'd hurt his shoulder.</p> <p>I'd never felt so thoroughly satisfied in my entire life. Every stroke, every moment, was like ecstasy. We kept kissing each other all over, our bodies aching until he pulled away, leaving me weak on the floor with need. But he pulled me close, his hands trailing over my body from my neck, down my hips, to my sides and up my sides before tracing over my nipples once again before pressing them into my skin. And now we were naked, on the floor, his cock hard and swollen pressing against me, ready for me. It was a desperate thing to have him inside me. But even more, he was teasing and torturing me. So I needed to come. He pulled me down from my knees and he kissed down my body so quickly I barely felt it.</p> <p>"No!" I cried, reaching a hand back toward him. "Please, please just don't make me wait any longer."</p> <p>His hands slid over me to cup my breasts and he lifted them so my nipples were right next to his mouth. His tongue flicked over them, swirling them between his lips. "Just don't make me...," I pleaded again as his lips and tongue made their way down from my breasts to my belly button. My back arched as he licked it then started licking down one hand to my feet. And then he kissed his way back up to my breasts, kissing every inch of my skin as he licked around each button. I groaned, my head tilting back as he kissed, sucked, and licked across each nipple before flicking them back and forth until they were engorged. "Please," I whimpered, almost frantic now, and he licked each of my eyes before moving further south, his tongue dragging from my neck, to my belly button, to my hips, and finally to my wet pussy lips.</p> <p>When he pushed his tongue in and started fucking me with it I practically screamed, the sound muffled by his cock. But my words made him go back to licking and sucking. His hands moved lower, and I felt him begin to move his fingers over my slit, making the moisture coat his fingertips. I heard his breathe catch in his ragged breaths as his fingers moved against my lips and clit. His mouth on my clit again sent an electric shock that went straight up the spine at the base of my skull and up into every part of my being. And as my muscles contracted I felt my orgasm start, then release. I was gasping so loud that he was forced to close his mouth over my mound where he continued to stroke against them, his fingers sliding over my clit every time.</p> <p>I feltâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
