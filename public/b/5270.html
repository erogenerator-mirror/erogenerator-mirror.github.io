Looking over, I could see that she could barely move. I was hoping the tension hadn't gone out of the way. Instead, the tension got stronger with every time I thought she was going to let me go to the bathroom; or go to bed. Either way, the tension was still there. That's what made it so frustrating, she seemed to be unable to say no. I knew I didn't have the upper hand though.</p> <p>'You're so fucking perfect,' I said, and reached out with my other hand to pat her cheek. I could feel her eyes closing and her lips moving as though she was letting loose. She looked so vulnerable lying there, with her arms stretched out above her head. I pulled her legs back slightly and laid down beside her.</p> <p>"I love you."</p> <p>She looked up at me smiling again.</p> <p>"What? Don't lie."</p> <p>"Did you like playing with yourself?"</p> <p>"It was fun."</p> <p>"You did too, didn't you?"</p> <p>"Yes, it was sexy. I didn't want you to find out about it, did I?"</p> <p>"No, I didn't think so."</p> <p>I could feel her breathing deep on me.</p> <p>"What are you worried about?"</p> <p>"Well, the next time," she began, "I'm not sure if I can do it."</p> <p>"Are you ready for me?"</p> <p>"God yes."</p> <p>"Good." I rolled over, lying down behind her. I reached around her and began to caress her body.</p> <p>"I love you, too."</p> <p>I couldn't hold out that long, and rolled my head over her as I did. I was so close. I pushed her legs to one side of her, and moved the sheet away and got on top of her, spooning her. I wrapped my arm around her, and held her to me.</p> <p>"I'll be right here for you. I'm going to take over."</p> <p>I began to move my hips, slowly as I enjoyed the sensation of her warmth and my hardening manhood. It gave me pleasure to know that she could hold a higher level of trust towards me, and if she didn't, she'd never feel what she was feeling right now.</p> <p>I had to say something.</p> <p>I put my hand under her chin and pulled her face towards me, her eyes closed and her lips parted. There is a special way to kiss the inside of a woman. She doesn't seem to be capable of doing that, with her lips. Our tongues were dancing with each other in a most sexy and sensual dance. She wasn't kissing back the way I remembered; she was kissing me back.</p> <p>I was now grinding into her as hard as I wanted to, but it didn't seem to come anywhere near as well as I had imagined. I felt as though my cock might burst at any second.</p> <p>"Oh, Jack, oh you're hard," she suddenly said between out soft kisses.</p> <p>"I didn't make you come," I said as I put my lips back to her neck and my hand down to play with her clit.</p> <p>"Oh yeah," she whispered.</p> <p>I continued rubbing her, and gently pinched her nipples between my fingers.</p> <p>"Mm, that's so nice," she said. "Are you sure you're ready?"</p> <p>I didn't answer her; I just let go of her breast and continued to pinch and move her clit between my thumb and index finger.</p> <p>"I want you to make me come," she whispered again. "Make me come, Jack."</p> <p>"Not just yet."</p> <p>"Tell me you want me to play with your pussy," she asked.</p> <p>"I don't, I want to make you come," I said in her ear as I pulled back.</p> <p>"I want you to make me come," she said more loudly. "I want you to fuck me with that beautiful cock of yours."</p> <p>"Ok, I will baby. Where were we, you sexy bitch," I said as I lifted up off her and rolled over quickly positioning myself between her legs.</p> <p>Her hand shot under my face pulling my face onto hers, her other hand wrapped around my cock and began slowly caressing the tip up and down her lips.</p> <p>"That seems like something I want to do," she giggled.</p> <p>"Do you want me to put it in?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'd love for you to put it in," she said.</p> <p>I slowly slid onto the bed with her as I began to rub the tip of my cock up and down her waiting lips. She was now lying on her back, her right legâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
