"I have come here today to offer you a very special gift and to prove my sincerity." He then moved back as he went to a desk drawer, opened his jacket pocket and took out a piece of something and a card. "This card is from you my dear." He held it up, his face hardening even more. "I'm a very special man, as you know, and I know that as we meet we share many, many things. May we come to each other's arms and share our deepest passions? Please don't answer. I am with you tonight and I assure you that you will enjoy yourself with me."</p> <p>He turned to her and asked, "What is this card?"</p> <p>Her hand was shaking so badly. He smiled and said, "I know that you are so overwhelmed by what you've read in your dreams and thoughts, and I was thinking of how we could come to a moment or two of mutual happiness. I have no plans to keep you away from me tonight with all of your dreams," he said.</p> <p>She thought about taking the card to her hotel room and seeing what he had with him and how much fun the night would be if they made love. She decided against it because he was still very young and would have had no idea about the promise that she made to him. She hoped he would find her attractive on a level that would be hard to beat and was determined that he would. He said, "No, do not bother. You will enjoy your evening with me tonight, my dear."</p> <p>She smiled at him as she picked up the card and looked at it as she smiled at him. His smile of acceptance and surprise made her happy.</p> <p>He leaned down and gave her a gentle kiss then, kissed her hand, and said, "Goodnight, my dear."</p> <p>She looked at him as he sat back up and said, "I'll have to take you to where you dreamt you to be at the moment of our meeting."</p> <p>She smiled at him and said, "I hope so. See you in the morning. If not, we'll both be in a better shape to make love. I am not looking forward to being alone in the morning. It's been a long day, dear," as she said it she got up and started walking towards the doorâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
