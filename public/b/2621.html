She leaned down again, licking her lips. Her lips, just an inch away in front of him, and he could smell her. But she was not satisfied; she kissed him again, deeper this time, moving a bit closer. She lifted herself up again, and he found himself staring down her top: and that's when she saw him. It was his eyes - those eyes! The look was so deep and powerful. Like a warrior of some kind. His own eyes were the strongest thing he'd ever seen in his life, a look she'd never failed to send him through in the process, making him burn with desire to go and conquer it all. Not to mention there was that look in her eyes too - and what an incredible look she had. Her own eyes that were already half closed as she gave herself to him. There was a look like a lion and a tiger, she thought.</p> <p>When she kissed him again and saw him twitch in that position, she stopped him again. "No" she said with conviction. "Not yet," she added, and smiled. He was completely at her mercy but it was enough now. He just needed to say something. She knew from experience that something like that wouldn't work out, so she gave him an even harder kiss. Just as suddenly as she had kissed him, she pulled back again and looked into his eyes. "I need to go now," she said. He nodded. She smiled, and then gave his cock another squeeze with her fingers. All the while she massaging his cock, running her fingers up and down his length a couple of times. His eyes were locked with hers.</p> <p>"Now do you need to go? I feel too old to go right now," she teased him. "You're still so hard." She gave him another squeeze and moved over to the bed... "Just give me an hour and I'll let you know when you can come. You know I like that." She kissed him once on the mouth, then turned and left the room.</p> <p>It wasn't a long walk to her office in one of those skyscrapers. It was a bit of a hike back to the cabin but one that she loved and never wanted to stop. She was still a bit sore from the encounter the previous evening, and her body ached from the drive a few miles in. But she knew she'd come to enjoy it more in the morning than right now. "It's so beautiful," she said as she pulled open door. There she was, at the foot of the stairs and walking up to the bed. She walked slowly, making certain to sway her hips as she made her way up to his bed. By the time she made it all the way up, she could feel the sweat start to pour from her body. She stopped just before the bottom of his bed. "You're not sore like I thought. You're just a bit tense," she said.</p> <p>"No, it's not that at all. It just feels good."</p> <p>It was the truth. She had come here so many times, each time feeling as if she were ready for any man that might take her for granted. Even without having the slightest inkling of anything more than a quick peck on the cheek. And then, it suddenly struck her that she knew him. Just because he seemed to be interested in her, she wanted him to do so too. "Thank you for taking me, that was fantastic," she smiled as she took it all in.</p> <p>He nodded. "Yes you did. You've been a wonderful companion," he said as he reached her feet. She took an extra big step in and he embraced her. She pulled back and kissed him once on the lips. She let him pull her up onto his lap. "This was one of those nights," she sighed. She smiled to herself - a smile she wished she had not given up so many nights ago.</p> <p>"You're so sweet," he whispered into her hair as he ran a hand down her back, bringing her hair to her hips. She took his hand and placed his thumb along the crease of her cheek, running through the curls on her neck, and down to her shoulders just below the collar on his shirt. They looked so good in the dark, and she could feel her body warming to his touch. Then came the kiss and she knew she wanted more. It was so wonderful that the last kiss was a whole different thing than the one she had known. She didn't want it to end. She reached behind her and pulled the bottom of her shirt over her head, letting it fall to the floor. They kissed again, her breast pressed firmly against his chest through his suit jacket. She slowly moved her hand down to his chest, stopping for just long enough to remove his jacket, dropping it onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
