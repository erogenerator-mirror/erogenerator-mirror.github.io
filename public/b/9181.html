John asked, concerned looking. "I was wondering if everything was okay."</p> <p>"Sure," she replied. "It's nothing to worry about. I just want you to be happy."</p> <p>"I'm ok," John said softly. "I was pretty upset today."</p> <p>"It's ok," he heard her reply, "It's just that I haven't felt this way in so long. I've been hoping for this since we met."</p> <p>Irene smiled, and kissed him gently on his lips. They both got out of bed and stood up. "Thanks to you," she said as she held him. They went up stairs and into the bathroom. "So what's this headache you have?" she asked, looking at John's swollen forehead as he sat on the toilet.</p> <p>"I'm fine," he replied, a bit sheepish as he looked at his forehead again. "My head was pounding from the pain. There was light here as well."</p> <p>"That's my good luck headache, I think."</p> <p>"Thank you," John said, smiling as he handed Irene his shirt and shorts. "Are you sure you're ok?"</p> <p>"Just a bit dizzy," she replied, looking down as she felt his hair around his skull and face. His hair was thick and wavy, and her hair, just a little darker, but it was a good shade of white. She stood up and looked in the mirror to see what kind of effect the blackness of Irene's hair would have. "I'm worried about something," she said.</p> <p>"What's that?" John asked, trying to focus on his head. "It looks just like the ones that my mom left me," he muttered.</p> <p>"Your mum?" she asked, surprised that she'd seen it when she got there.</p> <p>"Yeah, hers was blonde."</p> <p>"But yours is blue. The colour of the colour her mother left me."</p> <p>"It's too dark," John said, "it's not your colour. I've got a big red stain in this head. But it's your colour and not mine," he said, laughing as he spoke.</p> <p>"I haven't seen my mum naked before," she joked as she brushed her hair back, "so it's not as if I've never let a man see what I look like."</p> <p>John laughed at that thought. "You're right," he conceded. It was just the sort of thing that could be considered an affable and pretty adult woman, but it was still an unromantic experience to have your head hurt by his hair. But the real problem was that what would happen if he woke up had happened before his head did and Irene was gone.</p> <p>"If he wakes up before I reach for it," he said after a while and thought about a suggestion. "I'll go see what's going on," he called out.</p> <p>"That's a good idea," Irene said as she brushed his hair. "But I'd rather you wake up here with me."</p> <p>"Nonsense," John called back. "If something like this happens then its going to happen."</p> <p>"I don't think you're being very considerate," she called after him as she brushed his hair for him. "Go and get ready for your shave. I'll wait in your bedroom."</p> <p>"What? I'm not sure where I'm going," John said. "I've never done that before."</p> <p>"Of course you have," Irene replied and started up the stairs.</p> <p>"I'm not sure if this is what's allowed for a girl to shave," he replied quietly as he walked up the stairs, wondering why he'd even been told to do this. The woman he was supposed to shave for was a friend of his mother's. In fact she'd done it herself the moment before they met last year at a spa. He did it as a girl, he thought, since when did the concept of female genitals enter into the mix? That was before I met your friend, he decided. That's why he felt so uncomfortable about having to do this with Irene tonight. He'd had thoughts of her all night and that the whole way there had been no discussion. He knew he shouldn't have given John's friend the chance to shave but here he was doing it as a girl.</p> <p>It was almost a relief to come out of the bathroom when he walked in. Irene was waiting for him and she stood in the doorway. She looked at him. "Irene," he said softly, looking over her shoulder at him.</p> <p>"You don't have to do this," Irene said as she stepped aside and let him in. She stood watching his face as he entered the bathroom. "Look, I'm not really sure if I can do thisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
