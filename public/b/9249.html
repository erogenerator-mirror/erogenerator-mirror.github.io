It was so different when there was a guy fucking me and I started to get even harder.</p> <p>I told Mark to "pull out" and he did. I couldn't move. I just got lost in my whole body.</p> <p>I looked towards the clock and saw it was about six in the morning. It was time for us to go.</p> <p>On the walk back I told him what I had seen and what he might do next. He said the same.</p> <p>I didn't bother with condoms. I just told him he would be the first (if he wanted!). I was already hard again when we got back to my car.</p> <p>I still hadn't been sure whether I enjoyed it or not but I was sure I liked it.</p> <p>I had a couple more orgasms before I was ready for bed.</p> <p>Mark woke me up to say how much he liked it. I told him I loved it. He kissed me and we walked off to bed.</p> <p>Mark was right on time and we went straight to bed. I fell immediately on Mark. We got into the spoon position and started kissing. He started kissing me. I could feel his erection against me through the sheet.</p> <p>He had to move and go to the bathroom before he could see me. It was only then that I realized that his erection was still in his boxer shorts. It was getting harder and harder underpants. I couldn't get to him because I had the top half of my body in contact with his cock.</p> <p>I could feel it starting to throb and the swelling of the bulge. I pulled myself away from him and said a few words in between kisses, "I love you".</p> <p>"I love you too."</p> <p>I said and went into the bathroom to get a condom. Before getting on the bed I checked on our bedroom clock. The house was only about fifteen minutes away. But in an hour it would be too late and we need to hurry. I had no idea what to do next.</p> <p>When I knocked on his door Mark opened it almost without turning around. We were both naked and both of us were erect. I told him that I wanted him to suck me and then to fuck me.</p> <p>We kissed for a long time. Mark lifted his body to allow me to get in position.</p> <p>He started sucking me again, gently licking my cock and I took his balls. I felt his tongue and his lips all around my hard prick. He stroked my shaft with his tongue as he kissed and sucked me.</p> <p>I got on the verge of coming and when I was almost there I told him to move off me and take up the fucking.</p> <p>In a flash he was on my lap.</p> <p>"I want more - so get off me."</p> <p>"I can do this, I can take it", Mark said. He went and took off his shirt. He moved back to the edge of the bed and lowered his body to mine. He pushed his hard-on in slowly until he was fully inside me.</p> <p>It felt wonderful. I was having sex with Mark again and it was a feeling more exciting - and just as sexy.</p> <p>"You have really beautiful cock." I just let him do whatever he wanted and he didn't have to move.</p> <p>He started pumping my prick faster and faster and after a little more than fifteen seconds was groaning and crying and I was coming. I felt his sperm in me and it was really good.</p> <p>"It's the hottest thing I've ever had. I almost thought that it would end."</p> <p>He said that he had never had sex like it was that hot and he had just loved it.</p> <p>We were both still so wet from fucking and the excitement of the moment and we kissed.</p> <p>"That's a good start to get the best sex in England." he said.</p> <p>"I like it." I gave him a kiss and we went to sleep with my head against his chest. I woke up in the night wearing nothing but a robe. I was getting sleepy as I heard the water start.</p> <p>When I heard Mark open the shower door I smiled at him and said, "I love you".</p> <p>He kissed me on the cheek and said that he loved me too.</p> <p>He went to sleep with his naked body and his erect penis pressed against my belly. His dream was of sex with me and him at the end of it. But in his dream it happened in a way that I could only dream of.</p> <p>It was a really wild dream.</p> <p>And when I was up in the house one day I woke with my naked body facing my son-in-law who slept naked in his bed. As his naked body came closer I could hear the sound of the shower, a rhythmic rhythm, which I hadâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
