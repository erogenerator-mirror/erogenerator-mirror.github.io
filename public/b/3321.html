"So much pain and pleasure, in fact, that I was willing to go on a couple of years longer," she smiled, "I'd like to continue working with another female, if you feel like it."</p> <p>I couldn't say no. I just wasn't going to deny our relationship any longer. "What about the baby?" I asked.</p> <p>Natalie laughed and gave me a look of surprise. And, finally, said, "Don't worry about that honey. We're only getting started."</p> <p>*******</p> <p>My head was spinning. The time just flew by. It seemed like hours had passed by. Then, Natalie stood up from the table. Her long black hair was in place, her pale flesh glistened. She looked sexy...and she was stunning: her skin was dark and inviting. She wore a simple, yellow shirt that matched the top of her corset...very simple, but certainly sexy. Her skirt was simple...just a thin, black belt with a thin zipper. And, the blouse was a blouse and no bra. She wore a short black satin mini with buttons up the front. And, she wore high-heeled black shoes, black, and white. The outfit made me drool...that's the style of women in the sixties!</p> <p>The way her breasts were standing, I thought she looked stunning. It gave me a momentary moment of awkwardness, but I quickly recovered. I didn't want to go off alone.</p> <p>"Thanks for dinner" Natalie smiled, and stepped back towards the dinning room. She stopped and looked around a little. "We should get back on the floor," she giggled, "because I'm not going anywhere. Besides, your car wouldn't feel right for this kind of work". She winked, "Oh, by the way, your wife told me about you!"</p> <p>With that, Natalie's eyes locked with mine, and I could only stare. I was frozen...and she smiled as I stared. She started to unbutton her blouse.</p> <p>"Wait", Natalie said. "Let me give you a few minutes to collect yourself". With that, she dropped her skirt to the floor. She stepped out of her panties before she left the room. My eyes feasted on her body. She was a true delight. The look of lust on her face told me everything, and more. It was an incredibly erotic sight, and it was also a turn on for me.</p> <p>"Wow" I said, "you're incredible."</p> <p>"That's because you're a man, honey", she replied. "I was a woman and what I see today is a woman." I nodded at the image and her voice filled me with confidence. "A woman is beautiful, isn't she?" I couldn't help but respond in a sarcastic tone. "She's beautiful, isn't she?"</p> <p>"She's very beautiful," I replied. "Thank you for sharing, though", said Natalie, a glistening smile on her lips.</p> <p>"But I'm not getting a lap dance", I said, "what you've been talking about, isn't something I was ever capable of doing. Please don't be upset or upset you're not going to make love to me, but this will be the start of a relationship. We'll have an extended extended relationship."</p> <p>"I know", she said, "but I just need some time to sort my life"</p> <p>"Alright, just give me a minute so I can return the favor", I said, "and maybe I can even give you more time than that", I laughed.</p> <p>Natalie left the room, leaving me with the knowledge that she was more than likely going to find me irresistible to women. This made me wonder if she was even thinking of me at all. She came back a few minutes afterwards. It wasn't until I saw her beautiful face that I realized it wasn't me, but for the first time, a woman.</p> <p>"I hope you don't mind if I change the subject," Natalie said, "I'm ready to be with a woman again". That was good, because the way she said it just made me believe it.</p> <p>"Natalie, I don't think I'll be surprised if you're pregnant" I grinned, trying to sound serious.</p> <p>"Nonsense, honey", she replied. "I'm a woman and that's what pregnant means".</p> <p>"Yeah, but I don't really want it" I said, but to be honest, I wasn't so sure. Was I actually doing this, to find out just how far a woman could go or what if I was ever too old and fat?</p> <p>"Oh, you're not too old", she laughed. "So how should I expect you to expect me to make love to youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
