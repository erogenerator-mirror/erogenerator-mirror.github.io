He had an easy going personality with just a hint of Southern hospitality. I guess the only thing he really had going for him was a sense of humor that he never had."</p> <p>I leaned over to kiss her, but she batted my hand away. "I had enough of your silly games," she laughed. "I'm going to take a quick shower."</p> <p>I followed her to the en-suite bathroom, watching her slim body, and how her breasts were moving under the water. I loved watching them move in those little tight bikinis, and especially when she bent over in front of me. She gave me a funny look when she caught me staring when I turned around to look at her. I had to smile to say it was nice she's such a sexy thing, but she saw right through the moment, and laughed.</p> <p>When she stepped into the shower, she grabbed one of the shower heads on the wall, and turned around to give me another look at her. She had a good looking butt and legs I loved, that would go with her hips. I was happy that I'd never thought about the ass before, and so far, she looked like it had been carved in glass, like something one wall or another should have been. I loved the way a girl's butt was shaped, and I just watched it move slowly and sinuously as she got in there.</p> <p>She started the shower on the wall and turned it on, then put the shower head over the shower head and adjusted the temperature. "You're still wet, aren't you?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes I am," I replied as she began shampooing my hair.</p> <p>I had to laugh, because she seemed really nervous about being this close to the man I loved so much, and the guy who would be my best friend. She pulled me to her, kissing my neck until I was panting, and then she reached up and grabbed my cock, pulling it forward, not wanting to crush it, which it felt like hard. "I'm glad you're hard now," she said. "I thought it might get harder." She ran her hand up and down my shaft, moving the soap under it and all over my dick.</p> <p>"I was glad you decided to come home early," I said, "because I don't want this to end too soon." I turned her around, putting my hands on her hips, and lifted her up, kissing each of her butt cheeks in turn. "Now I'm going to finish washing you," I said as I pushed her toward the wall.</p> <p>"Not too quick," she laughed and leaned back more, spreading her legs. "The shower's not that long!" She pulled my face to her lips.</p> <p>I took a chance and kissed it. "Want me to make you feel good?" I asked as I licked it.</p> <p>"Oh yeah!" she said. "It's really exciting." Our tongues were dancing now, and I was really getting into it. I pulled her into my arms, and our lips were all over in an instant. Her pussy was already wet, and I licked her lips, and then slipped my tongue between them, lapping up her fluids, sucking them into my mouth. She started to moan and move against my tongue, and grabbed the back of my head, pushing against my mouth, which was still working its magic on her pussy. Then I did something I probably wouldn't have dreamed of, but was going to do. I slid a finger into her pussy, and she gasped, and put a hand on the back of my head. "Oh my god," she said, "don't stop. Oh my god."</p> <p>She was gasping for air and pushing her cunt against my face and tongue, trying to get me to touch her pussy more. "Do me! Oh god...oh my god...oh my god." She was really into it now, and I could not take it anymore. I reached up and put two fingers into her, and she let out a long moan as I started moving them in and out, slowly at first until she let me slip a finger from her pussy and replace them with my tongue.</p> <p>Her head was back now, her eyes closed, her lips parted and gasping for air, and she was rubbing her body and squeezing her breasts through her top. She was breathing hard, and her stomach was moving against my tongue, and I continued to tongue her. "Come on," I said, "come and hold me, we don't want the shower to come on."</p> <p>She nodded her head and reached back, pulling herself to me, and we kissed again, our tongues dancing, our pussies grinding against each other. I moved my hand down to herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
