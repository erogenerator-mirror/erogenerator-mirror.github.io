I cried out. I felt my orgasm build, my nipples tightening under his touch, my juices flowing. This was getting hot.</p> <p>"Are you ok?" he asked in concern. "Are you ok?"</p> <p>"Ahhh!" I cried out again. "I'm not going to stop!"</p> <p>"Oh, I thought you had no problem with that," he said, his finger still moving in and out, "it just felt so awesome."</p> <p>"No, don't stop!" I urged him on, wanting him inside me. "Oooooh!"</p> <p>"Are you sure?" he asked. "Your body feels good, honey."</p> <p>"Oh, yes," I breathed out. I didn't want to stop. I couldn't.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" he asked again, slowly moving his finger in and out. He could feel my pussy getting wetter with each movement.</p> <p>"Ahhh!" I moaned again, pushing back against his finger. I felt myself start to cum again, with another wave of pleasure to follow.</p> <p>"I was afraid you weren't going to like this," he said, pulling his finger out of me. The feeling of being empty was intense.</p> <p>"Why don't you just take off your clothes," I said in a tired tone, hoping he thought I wasn't joking. I wanted him inside me so bad.</p> <p>"You're really a hottie," he said, slowly unbuckling his pants. He unzipped them, and I watched him slide them off, seeing how his cock stood erect in front of his thighs.</p> <p>"I take it this is your opinion. I like it," he said as he sat down on his chair, his pants and underwear still down to his knees.</p> <p>I could see that he wasn't wearing any underwear. I looked at his cock a little more closely, my arousal growing again, as it swung between his thighs. The dark shaft was already wet, and I could see precum starting to run from the tip, wet and ready for action.</p> <p>I could feel my body tightening, trying to hold this feeling back. I wanted it, and didn't want to lose it, not yet. I started to rise to my feet, taking a deep breath, knowing he would only respond if I didn't say the word.</p> <p>He stood and stared at me a moment. His eyes moved down my body to where his cock was throbbing. It was all I could do not to rush him, but I knew that I had to resist, and that the moment would be too long. I looked up at him, begging him to leave me alone just when I was about to lose myself again.</p> <p>"You want this?" he asked, reaching out to run the head of his cock along the slit of mine, right along my slit. I closed my eyes and let out a soft moan, wanting more, needing more.</p> <p>"Mmm," I moaned again, my legs spreading wider to give the intruder more access.</p> <p>Then he started to run it up along my lips, opening me up a little more, getting the feeling of warm, moist, liquid coming from within me. He pressed it against me, the feeling was so intense. I started to get close, and he stopped just before I did, but didn't stop.</p> <p>"No," was all I could say, and he stopped moving up from my hole.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Don't stop," I begged. "I'm gonna cum."</p> <p>He smiled and then, without warning, pushed his cock into me. I felt the shock of pain and pleasure, but at the same time the feeling of having him inside me was wonderful. I could see him looking down at my face, watching my eyes roll back.</p> <p>"You like the way I feel inside you?" he said, as he put his hand up to my cheek, caressing it. I closed my eyes again.</p> <p>"I want more than that," I whispered. "I want to be your slut," I told him. I opened my eyes just long enough to see his cock moving in and out and my pussy lips quivering. He put his hands on my breasts, squeezing his palms over them, gently massaging the hard flesh. I leaned against his chest, the pleasure just starting to get me light. My nipples stood hard, and I saw his eyes roll back, watching my face as I came again. He kept his cock inside me, slowly and deeply, moving his body back and forth. I could feel the throbbing deep inside me, and felt his body against mine again.</p> <p>Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
