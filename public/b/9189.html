I was going to try to get into a fight, but it was hard. I still loved and wanted them and no one in particular would hurt me again.</p> <p>"Please," I begged, "let us have a quickie. You can finish me off."</p> <p>That was not part of their plan. They pulled back and held me down. Both of them seemed to hesitate for a moment, but then they started taking off my clothes, which I found odd. The others were standing around by the bed watching me. They stripped completely and started to take off. I wanted my hands to be free, but they held my wrists tightly with each hand. I watched them take their clothes off, naked from the waist up. I wanted to feel them; feel their naked flesh pressing through me. As they finished they were still wearing their masks. They lay down on the bed. I looked at them with a sad expression on my face and saw them move one of their heads to me. It was as if they had rehearsed what I would do and had done. Both of them used their hands to gently caress me. They kissed me all over my body, working their way up, kissing me deeply, and then kissing me on the mouth. One of them was the one sucking on my nipple and the other one was kissing and sucking my other nipple. They kissed each other's bodies and I felt the first tingles of arousal in my groin when the other was kissing me.</p> <p>"Can we get back to kissing?" I asked.</p> <p>"We can try...," one of them said.</p> <p>I wanted to be there and do whatever we wanted. The rest of them did the same thing.</p> <p>"You know you like them," one of them finally said.</p> <p>I thought about that and thought, "Yes, what do you say about that."</p> <p>"Yes, I like them."</p> <p>"Please. It's so exciting. The two of you can be the ones that make me hard."</p> <p>"And you won't mind if they do? Can we get a threesome to prove my point?"</p> <p>The thought scared me. I was not thinking straight but I wanted a threesome. I just hoped it was as good as I thought it would be. They were both naked now and both had their bodies fully on display. I could have easily imagined a cock inside me as they both kissed me. I didn't say that to myself. I kissed each of those men. I loved them as I did these other men. All men had a way of seeing each others bodies. I would do anything for them.</p> <p>We kissed for several minutes and then they took our hands up and started feeling each of our bodies, paying special attention to my nipples and my pussy. They kept our hands where they wanted, and one of their hands moved down between us and rubbed my pussy. It made me feel good, a thing I never felt before. They continued massaging me for a minute until they moved their heads and I could feel their hot breath on me. They were kissing at the lips and when I opened my eyes I saw one of them kiss each of our lips then slowly, almost casually, they moved their way up across our shoulders, kissing all around my neck and shoulders as if they were kissing a special kind of friend. I felt a shiver. I wanted to reach out and touch their faces. I had to have them. I needed them. I wanted to feel them touch me.</p> <p>I felt the one kissing me, on my breast, slowly, lightly, running his fingers around my nipple and then back down the center of my taut body. I felt fingers between my legs as his other hand rubbed my pussy and I felt his hot breath on my nipples as his mouth closed over them and gently kissed and sucked them. The feeling was heavenly. It's odd to think that you're giving pleasure to yourself as if it's your body. It's very different to feel pleasure from another.</p> <p>Then my body began responding to their kisses and to this new sensation from it I felt as if I were being turned on by their kisses on me, and it made me feel like I should be feeling sensations in my body like this.</p> <p>It made me reach out and try to wrap my arms around their bodies and hold them to me as I wanted them to kiss me again. I could smell the scent of my body on their bodies. All that tingly sense of heat in the air. I knew I would feel something soft and warm touching me. I reached out as one of them moved his body onto mine. I could feel his cock against my pussy, its hard warmth and hard pressure against my lips.</p> <p>We touched, and felt, and touched each others' skins. We kissed as one who wanted to touch the others' body, or feelâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
