Lisa said. "The guy will want to get his hands on you, maybe I should give him your phone number." The words were almost too painful to make.</p> <p>"I suppose you're right. But I have to be honest, so please let me tell you what this will do. Don't call him."</p> <p>There was no time for answers immediately. Just before her phone rang, she picked it up and dialed his number.</p> <p>"Hello?"</p> <p>"Just call me."</p> <p>"Just call me."</p> <p>Lisa wanted to say something else. Why did he say the 'call me' bit anyway? But then another tear went into her eyes. This was just another piece of the puzzle.</p> <p>"Yes, I just want to tell you, Lisa. I love you."</p> <p>"I'm going to call you back, so just say my number and I'll get over there."</p> <p>But that was what he wanted, so she said his number one and got on her cell phone. It was her first call from him and she knew he couldn't wait.</p> <p>"I'll be right there." She said. "You will be my special man. My baby and baby's father."</p> <p>"My baby's daddy?"</p> <p>"Yes, and I'm about to give him your number."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"I know what you're thinking. I have always wanted to be called your baby daddy. It's the only name I can really call you. Just call it now and you will be my baby. I love you and I love you."</p> <p>She was shocked at first to hear his words. But then she was able to say, "It does sound like a nice name. Thank you baby. You don't need to call me anything special."</p> <p>"You're welcome. And I'm really sorry for this, but it will never happen again. I love you."</p> <p>"I love you too."</p> <p>She was happy with the result. After only a year of marriage, it was clear to her where she was going with her life.</p> <p>At least for a year, she lived her life at home. Lisa couldn't even remember ever losing her virginity. Her husband wasn't the kind to make her do things that she didn't want to do. They only knew about each other once, at least. But at that point, life was much easier.</p> <p>Lisa didn't think much about the situation with Brian before that call. After all, she had known him longer than she knew Greg. Their relationship was so much more than just friendly and casual sex. As soon as he said it, it would go from there. She knew that she wanted to find out more about Brian, and he wanted to know more about her.</p> <p>And he wanted to know that she wanted to hear from him a bit about his life and where they had grown up. And that if he got a job, he could help her with things that she couldn't do with Greg's family. And that he wanted to start a family with her. And she was sure that she would be happy with that arrangement. That they could look forward to each other.</p> <p>To be continuedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
