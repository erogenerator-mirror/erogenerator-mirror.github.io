"Would you like to know the next little thing that's going on?" She held out a hand to him, "and you won't look so worried anymore, will you?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I do," he replied, and with that Rebecca took his hand and let him escort her across the small room, all the time leading him by it as the other guests were standing, clapping. The little cluster of friends that Rebecca had spoken of had suddenly appeared around the table, so the new group had settled down between them, not as individuals but as a group, having gathered themselves up as the party moved around to begin.</p> <p>There was a lot of general conversation going on there for a few minutes, Rebecca, as she was still holding her hand to keep her step, was aware of the effect the whole room was having on them. She could tell they were all looking right at her, even with their faces slightly turning to one another.</p> <p>"This is just what I'd like to do when we're ready to go," she said, breaking the mood in the room. "We've got a whole bunch of people to pick from up there. It's going to be hard to keep all of this a secret," she said with a little sarcasm in her voice.</p> <p>The tension that had been building between Rebecca and Dave had suddenly dissipated. They were having some drinks and dancing together with several of the guests, and they were all very obviously feeling the effects of the joint that Becky had just finished taking.</p> <p>"So, we're ready to go?" Sarah asked.</p> <p>"It's still early," Rebecca answered. "I think we'll have a couple more dances, I think I might want to sit you down afterwards and get another round if you're ready."</p> <p>"Yes, that sounds right," Sarah answered. "Would you like me to come up with you another round?"</p> <p>"Definitely not," Rebecca returned, looking at her watch. "We'd better get started, or I'll be ready by lunchtime and we'll be late."</p> <p>"Okay," Sarah agreed. "Where we going?"</p> <p>"I'm guessing you've got to get some rest of your stuff, and we're definitely not coming back into the party until morning. I don't think I've ever been invited to a party before on a real estate convention," she said with a laugh.</p> <p>Becky was already clapping again and cheering her on as Rebecca walked across the room. As Rebecca passed the group and stood next to her, she could still feel the vibes coming from the crowd. It was as if Rebecca had something inside herself that made the people around her feel as if she was somehow under the control of others. And, she was definitely under the control of others and not just any of them. Rebecca could imagine a lot of things that were coming her way at that moment, and she didn't need to make them feel anything at all. It was actually rather nice to be the source of such pleasure. Rebecca was the only one who seemed to have the nerve to ask for permission to bring her things to see.</p> <p>As she approached the table with Becky in tow, she looked at Rebecca. They were standing there, both of them waiting, one of them talking. Rebecca knew from her previous conversations with Sarah this would be the one she wanted to ask Rebecca for permission to bring her things. Rebecca wasn't sure that she would really be able to ask Rebecca for permission to bring her things, but since she would have been asking Rebecca for permission, maybe Rebecca was in a way trying to see her as some sort of submissive of the person that she thought had control.</p> <p>Sarah's eyes turned wide in surprise as she stared at Rebecca.</p> <p>"That's easy," Rebecca thought to herself. "I can't. I'm afraid. I'll give you the right to tell me what to bring to see me, just to be in the right state of mind. I'm doing this to help your parents with their son. I can't do it."</p> <p>"I'm afraid I'll need some kind of permission as well," Rebecca said somewhat to herself. "I don't like to be judged, or to be put off by anyone, but this is such a personal thing, if you don't get permission, so they'll tell me, and I'll go back to work just because I'm the one in here telling them, and I'm the one bringing out that stuff to get back to school. Why would I want to embarrass and hurt my own father just because I've asked permission?"</p> <p>There was a long silence before Rebecca spoke.</p> <p>"Oh, I don't know if I'm supposed to ask you thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
