I was a married woman. A husband's wife. A married woman like all others. But I thought about it. After all, I'm sure many had an idea how they would all have felt about that particular time.</p> <p>Anyway, after a time, I became aware of something I had been reading by reading a magazine about "lifestyle." I didn't understand why it was so "taboo." But I started to open with it. It was a time in my life to share an experience and get it out of my system.</p> <p>When I told Bill about those experiences -- and he wasn't very happy to hear mine -- he started to talk about me when he was in bed. He was getting upset, he complained about the lack of sexual gratification. My husband said he had thought it was some sort of sickness before we got married.</p> <p>Then he got back to me, "But the sex was not the great stuff. I didn't know my sister would let Bill have her. I thought it might be bad enough it would give me a chance to be with another man and I didn't want to get pregnant."</p> <p>The sex was great. I was sure we got to have a lot of fun with each other. I hadn't got back into that lifestyle yet, but I definitely wanted to. I don't think Bill had much of a need. I got turned on just thinking about it. But it wasn't the time to talk about it, or to share it with any man.</p> <p>In other places, there was some excitement and passion (like a lot of the things in the world you might imagine when you get older). I didn't like to see my kids playing with girls (even though I was still interested in the same kinds of things.) But that wasn't the most interesting "thing." I just knew that I'd get to enjoy sex with another man -- but not with a woman, at least not yet. My husband had to take care of Mom and I couldn't spend as much time playing with boys any longer.</p> <p>So I got back all the time to talk, but the truth is I found I had to get back. So I told him about my first experiences with other men, and we discussed it.</p> <p>He told me how it had happened, and said I had to be honest and tell him how I felt. And for me to tell him about sex was different from what I'd just told him. It didn't feel like a rape or an experiment. Just something to make sure I did at least one "normal" experience.</p> <p>It was exciting to open out there like that, with another man. I realized that I wouldn't be able to do more than that. So I told Bill that one might be a different story. If I had no interest in having sex with somebody else, what difference did it make?</p> <p>He laughed at that. No problem there. I just needed to talk to him. I'd never had a discussion like that with a guy before. It was sort of a joke, but it sort of felt funny to share it with him. I made sure to sound casual when I said it because it would make him even angrier. So I did. But it didn't make it easy to be honest and tell him.</p> <p>And of course that's when the sex really hit me. I couldn't stop thinking of the experience with my husband, and just the way he had touched me. I was hooked on things and was ready to put even more miles on a man I had only met.</p> <p>And just like I had a lot of other experience, I found that I really liked it. I loved the way it made me feel. I really loved the sex. If I wanted to, I could have. If I just wanted to go down that road I had. If I just knew what it was. If I enjoyed my sexuality more than Bill wanted?</p> <p>But it just didn't feel right to tell Bill what I felt. Even if it meant just doing it to myself right in the presence of our spouses.</p> <p>We had an almost normal conversation again, and again, but we talked about things. I started to talk about how I enjoyed Bill giving me my first anal climax. He'd never seen me take that on my own. He'd never done anything like it, but it did feel great.</p> <p>As I mentioned before, I enjoyed doing that. I loved the feel of his cock inside me. I still had the experience of having him inside me. It felt weird to show it to him, but it did feel good.</p> <p>I said it with a smile to Bill, "I did, actually. And then I really enjoyed it. I loved it, too."</p> <p>He was quiet. "I suppose you did." I smiled at him.
