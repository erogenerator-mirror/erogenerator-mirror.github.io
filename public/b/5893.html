I had never done this before in my life, but it felt good to do so and I found myself getting even harder. She was turning me on at a level I never could.</p> <p>As I was rubbing her leg, I was wondering if I could have a hand on her butt so she wouldn't feel left out. It was too dark and I started feeling her up and down. It felt so good, I was so close to actually making her cum and I wasn't sure if I even was going for a chance to do that. I stopped when her moans of pleasure started and took my hand up, looking at her while I did it. I smiled at her, realizing my heart was going crazy.</p> <p>I ran my fingers up and down my wife's bare pussy before slipping a finger into her. She started trembling and I kissed it before doing it again and again until I could feel she was ready to cum. I got up and knelt before her.</p> <p>"Cum now baby."</p> <p>She nodded and I slid my cock up her pussy and started teasing her lips with it before sliding it into her. She moaned and looked at me and kissed me again before moaning my name. That was all it took. I came, my sperm soaking into her belly as I started thrusting into her and she started shaking all over me. I never had a girl do that before, but what could I do?</p> <p>I pulled out of her before I finished cumming and she laid on the bed, still smiling at me. "Thank-you." Not in a sad way but in a cute way, she looked so happy, as if she just couldn't seem to believe she just did that. The only consolation was she didn't say anything about it.</p> <p>"That was amazing."</p> <p>"I know, I wish I could do it again but I guess now it wouldn't be my turn."</p> <p></p> <p>We fucked and fucked again, over and over again. This time when she rolled toward me, I knew she was ready for the main event as I entered her again. This time around, she was on her back and I was on top of her, my cock sliding in and out as we continued to laugh and talk nonstop between kisses. She was the best pillow I'd ever felt. I had a couple of glasses of wine as well and it didn't seem as bad a start to the night as it usually was.</p> <p>Just listening to her talk with me, it had become quite a blur. I just kept thinking about our last night together and how we would make it to the next morning. When we were done, we snuggled a bit and cuddled, before we fell asleep like that.</p> <p>She fell asleep and I fell over, waking her as she was starting to get up.</p> <p>"Good morning."</p> <p>We both looked at each other and smiled before I started undressing.</p> <p>"Did you do it?" she said with surprise.</p> <p>"Of course."</p> <p>"But.."</p> <p>"But what? I'm a married woman, remember?"</p> <p>She laughed and kissed me. "So are you." We both laughed.</p> <p>That night, when she felt really good, she let me know that she wanted to do it once more. "But this time, I want to do it again, I want more." She smiled and kissed me with enthusiasm.</p> <p>The next day, when she got up, she asked if I ever had a thing for her.</p> <p>"I'd be happy to have anything at all." I said.</p> <p>"I like that." She laughed.</p> <p></p> <p>The next day she got up, kissed me, and walked into the bathroom. "You were wondering about that."</p> <p>"Yeah," I didn't quite know if she was joking or what.</p> <p>"It was a first for both of us. I saw you the other night. It really surprised me."</p> <p>The last time I saw her that day had been the day after our wild tryst. "I did? And how?"</p> <p>"Well, while you were sleeping there in my bed, you were talking about how I'd like to give it a try."</p> <p>I was silent for a minute. "Do you?"</p> <p>"Yes, like before. I thought that would be a good way to start."</p> <p>"OK! I'll do that. Is there anything you're interested in?" I was unsure if the idea of being with her was really something I wanted to pursue.</p> <p>"Are you going to do it?" This was the first time I had ever heard herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
