He kissed me back, his hand reaching to mine to feel me through my clothes. As I felt his hand inside my shorts feeling me, as well as rubbing my penis down. As I had been stroking my own I was surprised that I was hard right now! I ran my hand up under his shirt up and down his stomach, then to his dick, squeezing it as I did. As he pushed up against me I reached for my own. He was already hard again and wanted to slide into me. His lips found mine and he entered me very quickly. He stopped just long enough to say, "Mike, I want to taste you." Then he pulled away, stood up, reached into the bedside table and pulled out a box of condoms, tossing one to Paul and getting another pair to himself. As soon as they were gone I rolled a condom onto my fingers and got up on the bed. Then I moved over to Mike and kissed him hard on the mouth. We traded places again as I felt his cock enter me from behind as he continued to kiss me. I felt him enter me deeply and started to stroke him as I could and felt the head of his penis slide along the walls of my canal. His cock was so hard, so wide, so deep I could barely move, it felt wonderful. We could do anything now! I could do anything! And I know Paul had wanted to be the first to ever do that. I rolled over so I could hold Mike while he penetrated me and felt his penis slide down my canal. Then he thrust hard into me, hard enough that I felt his pubic hair scratching my skin. He was so deep inside me I thought he might come out of me as he did. But I was so wet and hot! When we both came together that first time, it was one of the most intense orgasms I ever had.</p> <p>I lay on top of Mike as we came down from that last one. He held me and kissed me as we held each other. Our bodies were still and I knew Paul wouldn't mind if he had made love with us after he left. I felt Mike's hands begin to explore me again as he slipped out of me. Then we both got off the bed. Mike went to the other door and locked it while I went outside to the porch. When I came back, there was a note on the deck of the old cabin. When we all went inside I found my clothes laying on top of the clothes pile. We had left the door open and we hadn't even had to remove them yet.</p> <p>I went to my bathroom and picked up the first one, sitting on it and pulling it in close to the toilet as I looked through the door. Mike was standing looking out over the lake, his clothes lying on the concrete porch. I knew he would not look at me as I was naked and he hadn't even gone inside yet. I was about to put my blouse back on when he came at the door. "No, Mike, leave it. You can get dressed while I get dressed!" I thought as I slipped my robe on and then opened the door and stepped out.</p> <p>He followed me, standing in the middle of the porch with his hand covering his crotch. He stood with his hand covering his groin. Once he had his hand inside my robe, he looked at me and my body and said, "I'm sorry, Paul, I'll leave it over. Sorry, I can't look again!"</p> <p>"It's okay, Paul. It was nice, really nice, really nice. I could watch you in the dark, naked. But, really, it was fine. It's been years and your body is sexy."</p> <p>I could see that he was blushing a little as he said that. But then I realized he had gotten turned on. "No, Paul, I can see now that it wasn't that bad. But the way you looked at me when the door opened, that was so sexy."</p> <p>I knew he was turning red again as he looked at my face. "Well thanks, Paul!" Then he pulled his robe off and his dick popped up to my face. I could see it wasn't so hard but it was pretty thick and hard. It wasn't as long as Mike's but thicker and longer! I could see the veins running up and down it. I put my hand on his member and caressed it and ran my hand along his shaft down to his balls and then back up to his head. It was hard and shiny and very, very hard. I moved away from it as he ran his hand down the length of my arms to the back of my shoulders. At first he just traced myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
