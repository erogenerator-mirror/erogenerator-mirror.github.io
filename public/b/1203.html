It was pretty much my only sexual experience. So after a while he was hard, and we went on to that, but after several more minutes and then a few more strokes to relax him it was time again. A little later he was ready and I guided his cock onto my mouth, with some slurping sounds going on. I was about to ask if he'd like me to suck his cock some more, when he stopped me.</p> <p>"You know, I never asked her to do that. I just assumed that she'd do it for me anyway."</p> <p>"What do you mean, assumed? What does that mean, assume?" I asked.</p> <p>"To kiss and fondle him." He admitted. "Actually, I got really excited over this idea. I mean, I could tell that when you were standing at the end of the bed, but I couldn't see what you were doing or that your husband was."</p> <p>"What do you mean?", I asked, "did it mean anything? Is this a set-up?".</p> <p>"No, it was actually quite erotic at another time." He replied. "But she seemed to not have any interest and I thought that it was time for us to take things to the next level."</p> <p>"What, are you a pervert? " I asked. "I'm going to teach you a lesson."</p> <p>I started to ask him, but before I could, he said, "No, of course not, and I meant it." He hesitated for a moment and then he laughed.</p> <p>"How do you know"? he asked, "is it something you do?" I'm guessing that he wanted to continue but instead he said, "OK, but let's try something else first."</p> <p>He continued to watch us and took in my body and my outfit for a minute or so, then, when he thought I wasn't going to object at all, he reached out with his left hand and squeezed his leg. I guess I didn't want to ask how he knew about me and I wasn't going to object, and again said nothing. I guess he felt the same way, and again he began to softly stroke his leg before he sat back. I continued to watch with him and he took my hand and placed it on his shaft and I was amazed when his erection began to respond in kind and he began to stroke himself.</p> <p>I reached up with both hands to my blouse and began to unbutton it. As I pulled the top down just a little further, he gently stroked the outside of his thigh, and began to rub his fingers up and down the outside of his cock. I moved my hands off the inside of my blouse and gently began to unbutton it as he gently fondled his cock with one hand. At that point, he began to softly kiss and lick behind my ear and down my neck. I don't know if I had expected this but it felt so good that when he reached my bra strap I just leaned into him and let him pull my blouse down and start playing with my tits. I was not resisting at all. After a little while, I leaned back and undid his pants, and he helped me to pull them and underwear off and then helped me lift my skirt and my panties off.</p> <p>At this point, the lights were beginning to lose all of their power. Finally, I was standing there with my panties around one leg and my skirt around the other, and he was rubbing himself to the sight of me, naked in front of him and me without a bra and a stiff cock in it. His face became very close, and I could see he was really getting turned on, the way most men are during the first stages of an orgasm. As I looked down at him and saw his tongue working on his lips and nose, I slowly began to feel the electricity starting to radiate through my body and it seemed to be affecting him. As I watched, he began to fuck himself faster and harder, his breathing became more ragged and his knees began to buckle. As I saw him, I saw the clear liquid start to begin to run down the slit of his head and it ran down onto his balls and I felt a shudder of lust as I saw his face. Then, it was too late. The last thing I remember was feeling so excited and proud that I had climaxed, but not to the point of an orgasm. I don't know how many or how many more or how many more he made me do. Then, I felt something start to happen to me just as the last one of my first orgasms started to subside and just as he had done, his cock began to twitch and twitch more and more until finally I felt it shoot ropes of cum all the way to my breasts.</p> <p>When he finally stopped and began to slip of me, I just heldâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
