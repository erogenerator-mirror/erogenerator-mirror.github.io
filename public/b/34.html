In a flash, the door flew open and we were inside, a huge set of furniture strewn across a big living room.</p> <p>"Oh," I breathed, watching as a woman stepped out, followed by another woman. I could've sworn I heard a girl's voice. There was a moment of silence as the girls and I froze, and then we both looked at each other, shocked that no words could be spoken, and so quickly that our eyes kept darting from one to the other.</p> <p>"Is it him?" I finally asked.</p> <p>"Yes," said the girl.</p> <p>"Shawn..." I began quietly, unsure of what to say. I knew I wasn't a lesbian, and my mind raced through dozens of scenarios—the girl in the dark, or the woman with me, or my boyfriend... and finally I blurted out, "Is he the one?"</p> <p>The girl smiled, a genuine sweet smile, then turned to the girl and smiled, "No. Shawn told him it was you."</p> <p>The other girl smiled with her lips curled in a wry little smile. "That's great," said the girl.</p> <p>"I should've guessed," I whispered. "He's a boy."</p> <p>The other girl nodded as if she knew me, and then she and I both turned and faced each other as though this were actually a normal move happening. We stood silently, waiting for what would come next.</p> <p>Shawn's face took on that same solemnity that he usually displayed as he walked around the kitchen, and he slowly approached both girls. In no hurry, he looked me over from head to toe and finally turned to his girlfriend. "What do you think?" he asked, and she could only nod. He stood between them and studied her; she was tall, about five six, with a lovely face, long brown hair that shimmered in the dim lighting. It was clear that she wasn't wearing a wedding ring, and her pale olive skin was contrasted beautifully with the deep mahogany of the furniture. She was quite beautiful.</p> <p>He began by staring at our hands, and then his eyes moved upward; the girls were both still looking at each other, and our eyes kept going. As he stared at her slender hand, her fingers were curled in her fist. He looked back down at her hand; it was small, like a baby at his mother's hand but not quite as large, and her nails were long and elegant like an angel's. He could have been an old man, she said to herself. The more he stared at her, the less she could deny him. Finally, he looked back at me and smiled. We stepped into each other's arms. Her touch was as close to soothing as any other part of my body, and she was almost too soft to fit in my arms.</p> <p>He held me tight, "What happened... is nothing he didn't expect."</p> <p>She smiled, "It's just..." She leaned in and looked directly at the man standing next to her.</p> <p>"That's right, I don't know what possessed me to tell him... if I had of..."</p> <p>"It's ok," she said, "Shawn told me he was curious, so I told him to come over and see you." She saw the sadness in his eyes, "And, I'm glad you told me."</p> <p>I smiled and held her close, "Thank you... for coming."</p> <p>We moved back out into the living room and I could feel my cheeks blushing. Her touch had made me feel like a schoolgirl again, and as we stepped out onto the large, plush carpeting there was a soft, feminine air and I knew everything was fine with the two of us. As we stood in front of him and looked at each other, I couldn't help myself and I touched her elbow, looking at him with tenderness.</p> <p>After a few moments of silence, the man approached and leaned back with a smile. "It was lovely to meet you. You two have been a little while." He reached out and took my other hand gently in his. "Will Shawn be joining us later?" He asked.</p> <p>"I'm sorry to talk about him, of course," I said.</p> <p>"No, not a problem. I was just nervous, and Shawn was just shy and shy all at the same time."</p> <p>He smiled, "I know; this is a great place to meet... friends...."</p> <p>"Friends? Friends... what friends are?" I asked, not certain I liked that term, "Friends of people I know!"</p> <p>We continued walking along through the house, him watching us the whole way. After a few moments, my mind began racing. —</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
