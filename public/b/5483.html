Cumming!"</p> <p>It was all I could do to hold it in my body.</p> <p>Mark grunted "Oh God!! Ahhh!!!!"</p> <p>"Yes!!!! Yes!!! Yes!! Ohhhhhhhh!!!!"</p> <p>We had only a moment to catch our breath but it was not until we had to do our own orgasm that we knew it was a long time.</p> <p>After all we'd just done; it was time to go back to our room.</p> <p>We went out to the balcony and sat in silence.</p> <p>He whispered: "I love you."</p> <p>I whispered back, "I love you too."</p> <p>I kissed him and said, "Oh God... that was wonderful."</p> <p>We were still holding each other and he leaned in for a second and kissed me on my lips. It felt so erotic and erotic.</p> <p>"I love you," I said in a quiet whisper.</p> <p>We both got up and he went back into his room and I took his hand and helped him to his bed.</p> <p>When we lay down; he put his right arm around me and he said I loved him.</p> <p>He turned on his back and I put my head on the pillow where my head rested on his shoulder and he put his hand gently on my back. We smiled at each other as we kissed.</p> <p>Then after a while of gentle kisses we turned to face each other and he was kissing me in the way I knew so well.</p> <p>After a minute he said, "I got hard from the kiss."</p> <p>I replied, "I've been hard."</p> <p>He replied, "Then we kissed some more and then I kissed you."</p> <p>"How the fuck did you do that for so long?"</p> <p>"I don't know but I can relate."</p> <p>We were silent again for a while; then our eyes met and I couldn't believe what I had just done. I was so happy that I was getting to know someone and I really wanted to know why.</p> <p>And to make it clear to Mark that I loved him. He replied, "You do too."</p> <p>It had taken us a few minutes to gather ourselves. After a while we got up and got dressed. Then we went back out to the party and danced and kissed some more with lots of touching and fondling.</p> <p>When we got back to the room, he said, "I couldn't believe what I did. You were so sexy! And I'm hard again."</p> <p>"You could stay hard all night and be hard all day?"</p> <p>We both laughed and kissed.</p> <p>"When I'm hard, I can't help myself because you are sexy."</p> <p>"And you like being sexy."</p> <p>We sat in the back of the limo kissing. Then I took it off; and Mark took it off as well. We got back home and went to bed.</p> <p>I was asleep in a minute but in the next moment I felt his cock slide into me and we made love. The excitement that we both felt at that moment was a special feeling I was sure to have and Mark and I were both turned on by it a lot. We both moaned and groaned as it took a little more and we started to increase our pace making sure we were in tune that we wouldn't be caught out of control doing each other.</p> <p>After a while Mark said, "I gotta pee."</p> <p>I said, "No, there's something else I have to do first."</p> <p>"Don't bother," I said.</p> <p>Then I whispered, "I like it when you use the big dildos too."</p> <p>I turned over and Mark slid on his back and I lay down in between his legs. We kissed and kissed long and hard. I felt his big warm hard cock slide between my legs.</p> <p>I said, "I love it."</p> <p>"I love it also."</p> <p>Once again, we were both in a state of bliss.</p> <p>After kissing and kissing, and then kissing some more and then kissing some more, we started to do each other's cock again. I couldn't believe how good it felt, the excitement that was shooting through my body.</p> <p>Mark said, "It doesn't feel like a hard cock."</p> <p>"It feels good, it's actually very good," I replied.</p> <p>At first I kept telling myself that Mark didn't have to do it, that he can have me anyway, but soon I was really turned on by this.</p> <p>After a while of kissing andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
