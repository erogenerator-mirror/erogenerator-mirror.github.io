Her hair hung across her face, like a halo. Her eyes were bright and sparkling, her cheekbones slightly concave and her smile even more infectious. She lifted her hands to his jawline, causing his eyes to burn into hers. Those white lips, so warm and pearly, parted in a smile, inviting his gaze. Jenny was obviously attracted to him, he thought. He was still thinking that some sort of spell existed between them, though he couldn't say for sure. All he could do was think about how this would work. How to proceed from here, but with no pressure of course. Jenny's eyes still locked with his as she said, "So I guess something good has happened." She seemed to think it over a long time. She lifted the top of his shirt over his head and began to unhooked the bra. Slowly, almost seductively, she pulled it off.</p> <p>Her hands came back to rest on his shoulders. He closed his eyes as she drew the straps of his bra off her fingers. He could feel his heart racing. Her hands, their touches, her eyes, all over his body began to heat up. His chest quickly became rock-hard.</p> <p>"There.” She said. "That feels so good," she smiled. He smiled back and let out a long breath. His cock was straining against his jeans, begging to be touched.</p> <p>Jenny stood and started to unbutton her blouse, sliding it off her shoulders. She looked up into his eyes once she had the garment dropped to the floor. He could see the pink lace of her bra through the white fabric. She was gorgeous, he told himself. She turned slowly and reached behind her neck, undid the clasp. She let the fabric fall away and let it drop from her body.</p> <p>He groaned in awe as she reached up to cup her breasts and gently caress themselves under her bra. The bra made her breasts look even sexier than they had all those years ago. She raised her arms, letting the straps fall off her shoulders. Her breasts were full, a full C cup with large pink areolas above and big puffy nipples. He watched them sway with her movements.</p> <p>Jenny's hands reached up to slowly slip the lace straps off of her shoulders. She turned around, her hands slowly reaching up toward her shoulders. Her hands drifted downward, to cup her breasts. Their fullness filling her hands, he thought. When her hands left her breasts and reached past Jenny's head, he could see them. Jenny's breasts were small, probably about a B cup. The nipples were tight, like pencil erasers. Her breasts sat high, high on her chest and full, round and full. He could see the slight dark circles surrounding each nipple. The skin around the areolas was smooth and warm. He wondered if her fingers were white, and how they would look on a girl. A girl. The thought scared him at first. But he had a feeling he would get there eventually.</p> <p>She cupped her breasts in her hands. They were firm, the feel of flesh. He wanted to hold them as they sat on his chest. He knew what would happen if he moved their arms. He felt the heat of her palms running over his skin. They danced gently with their own movement. They moved in little circles, caressing and kneading each other.</p> <p>He reached up and pulled her hands away. She turned to sit back down in her chair. "Here, let me," he told her. She put her arms down on the chair and leaned forward, her breasts swinging back and forth.</p> <p>He leaned forward and kissed her gently. She leaned back against him. With a sense of passion and urgency, he lifted her arms and draped them over the arms of the chair. He felt hot in his hands. His hands roamed over her back, his fingers sliding underneath her bra strap on both sides. He cupped her breasts, cupping it as he kissed her slowly. She felt so warm and soft, like nothing else he had ever held in his entire life. After a few minutes, he felt her relax. He let go of her breasts to kiss her on the neck again. She looked up at him and smiled.</p> <p>He slowly undid his belt and let his pants drop to the floor. He stepped out of them. He looked at her. There was so much of her. He couldn't take his eyes off her, taking in every inch of her. Her lips, her eyes, her skin, the smooth curves of her arms—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
