I've just been busy and haven't been allowed to talk about what happened. I know I'm not in a position to talk to you about that. I have to work. I really want to see you again."</p> <p>"I can't talk tonight. I have to get back to my job but I still can't stop thinking about you. I can't believe we bumped into each other so quickly, we almost fell in the pool." Sarah sighed and walked away. She stopped in her tracks when she turned back toward me and kissed my lips.</p> <p>"I miss you." She sighed deeply again. I leaned forward and kissed her again. Our kisses opened their mouths and our tongues darted around each other. I leaned back and looked at her. She turned and walked toward the pool. She saw me looking at her then she saw the smile on my face. She walked ahead of me until we reached the pool then stepped into it before turning to face me. I followed her.</p> <p>"Wow," I whispered. I looked her over, a few inches from me and she leaned closer so we were almost face to face. She leaned close again and I stared at her.</p> <p>"You are beautiful," I replied.</p> <p>"Thank you," she said, "I can't tell you how much you mean to me. You are special, funny, talented, intelligent and beautiful."</p> <p>I raised my arm and caressed her cheek, "Thank you, Sarah," I said.</p> <p>She lifted my hand from her face and ran her fingers through the silky red locks. She leaned in and kissed me softly on the lips. Her hand ran down my arm and over my fingers as her lips pulled away.</p> <p>"I know my place is as special to you as it is to me," she whispered.</p> <p>"I understand. It's just that you are such a wonderful friend," I added.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm not sure how to say this," she said. "I don't know if I can explain it." I felt an excitement in my belly as she said it.</p> <p>"Sarah," I said. "I have to go. I feel bad, I'm not sure what I feel but maybe I can help you and maybe I can get you to forgive me for being such a jerk."</p> <p>"Thank you, Jack," she said. I watched her hands lift the material from her breasts and her nipples puckered as the material slid down her chest. She lifted her arms up and held herself against me. I felt the swell of her breasts and the small, dark areolas surrounded her nipples. I took her hand and led her through the house to the back yard. She turned to face me when we reached the bank of the pond.</p> <p>"Let's get into the water," she said, her face very serious, "if you don't mind if we do that."</p> <p>We dried each other off then headed back toward the bedroom. I held her against me and pulled the other side of the soft bedspread down. I put my arm around her and she laid her head on my shoulder. I put my chin on one knee and rested my head on the other. We lay there for a minute then went to bed. I lay across her and we both fell asleep in seconds.</p> <p>After breakfast we showered, ate, we took a leisurely shower. While we were in the shower I decided to have this conversation with her.</p> <p>"I don't know if I can tell you what you want to know," I said.</p> <p>"No, not just anything," she replied. "I'm just glad you are so happy that I found somebody in my life who is so much better and isn't afraid to share some personal information."</p> <p>"I understand," I replied. "What makes you think that you can trust me?" I asked her.</p> <p>"I just thought that because I was alone and didn't have that kind of a life with someone who just let off the bubble a little," she answered. "I really think you know me and that maybe I could be the right person for you to get with, not just my friends who I've known for years."</p> <p>"It's going to take some time to become comfortable with a relationship," I said. "But I have to give you something that you want to know. What's it?" I asked herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
