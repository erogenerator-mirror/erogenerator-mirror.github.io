A lot of the times this causes a stir in your body, and many times you have to sit rather than stand up to do it. This will not happen if you have had a hard-on for awhile or are just lying in the bed, but you may think of something else in the morning.</p> <p>After you wake up, you lay there for a few minutes then fall back to sleep. After your mind and body relaxes, you realize that your prick is hard again, and it feels as if you might have urinated. You know that once in awhile, it will be a good idea to give yourself a good rubdown.</p> <p>As you lay there in the bed, you can feel you own warm fluids beginning to travel up and down your own body again. You feel your prick rise, and it has come to full erection which you know will be soon. As you turn to get up, you see me standing there with a wet towel in my hands. You see that I am naked too, which makes you begin to wonder about what is going on. You are not concerned with what happens next, as your being a bit aroused makes you all the more curious.</p> <p>You move to the door of the bathroom, knowing that you are about to be washed up and changed of course. Your eyes are still fixed on the naked body of the man who's hand is now in your own, as you make your way toward the bathroom. If you were going into a bar full of others, you might wonder if you are going home naked and with your hand over your prick. If you don't know him, you might wonder if you are going on with your new lover or just with the man in front of you. You decide to stay in the bathroom with the door partly open.</p> <p>"Why don't you start by washing up a bit, and I'll clean myself up," I say and reach around to pick up my clothes and towels off the floor.</p> <p>As I walk to the bathroom, you see that he is standing in the doorway, a towel wrapped around his body, and he is staring into the mirror. He looks up from his towel and sees that I am already dressed. A look of excitement and happiness fills his face, and you can see that he was just now discovering his new manhood.</p> <p>You walk over and drop your shorts and panties around your ankles. You quickly move toward him, bending over to pick up the towels, your bottom facing him at that point. This gives him an excellent view of your body, your firm butt, and the sway of your hips. You bend over and pick up the towels. As you are walking away he turns and looks at you for a moment and then reaches out and hands you up.</p> <p>"No, you stay right where you are. If you want to go back downstairs before we go out, you might want to do that first," he commands.</p> <p>You turn and walk out the door, and I follow you. "Do you think you have any luggage left?"</p> <p>"It's a suite, and the rooms are ready to go." You say.</p> <p>"I told you, they are ready to go, and you can take them yourself," I tell you in a serious tone.</p> <p>"No, I think they are about half way there. Please do put our gear away here."</p> <p>"It would be easier for me to change into it now," you say. Your breasts seem to be rising and falling in slight stages with your breathing, as if you are approaching cum. You can feel you are starting to become aroused once more.</p> <p>"Yes, the room is ready to go. It looks as if we should meet downstairs first, though," you comment as you walk back and out of the room.</p> <p>I put away my clothes and follow you down the hall to the elevator. Once you are in the elevator, you reach behind you with your hands and undo your bra, allowing your breasts to free themselves from it. You lean over to take it off and you can feel the coolness of the air on your exposed cleavage.</p> <p>"Oh, it feels so nice to do that for you," you say. "Let's give him a good show?"</p> <p>The elevator stops and the doors close as they start to open. We go out the door and down the hall. As the doors open you stand facing me waiting for him to ask you to sit on the bed on your back. His hands go to work on the buttons of your blouse, taking each button completely off and then lowering them on your breasts. He pulls your blouse off all the way to the back leaving your breasts exposed. Your nipples are already hard and standing out from your chest. He slides the blouse off your shoulders, and then letsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
