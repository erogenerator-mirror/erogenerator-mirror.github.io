I was just there looking at all the water. And seeing the look of delight on his face as he looked me up and down as I was coming out of the woodcutter’s arms,” Sarah added.</p> <p>Mark watched, and his heart started to race. He was about to feel the same excitement that Sarah did. But now, it seemed all of a sudden different. He glanced at her intently. She was right, he did look familiar.</p> <p>Sarah walked behind her husband, and when she saw the look in his eyes she felt her heart drop. But she also felt excitement too.</p> <p>She was proud of knowing what Mark had experienced. But he did make her husband proud. And Mark’s heart began to beat fast again.</p> <p>Mark felt the same.</p> <p>They walked in silence out on to the property.</p> <p>Suddenly Sarah had to say something to him. “Mark,” she said, and started walking back into the woods.</p> <p>“What’s up?” Mark exclaimed.</p> <p>“I don’t know,” she stated. He didn’t know what else she could say. She walked a little closer to him and he backed up, still looking at her. And she stood there for a second, staring at him. Mark reached out to wrap his arms around her.</p> <p>“Mark,” she said. “I love you,” she replied.</p> <p>Mark hesitated. He was nervous but he knew he was about to do something that he wanted to do and that could never go back.</p> <p>He leaned up and kissed her lips. “I love you,” he said softly.</p> <p>Sarah felt a thrill of excitement. And she could hear it in his voice. She melted into Mark. And they kissed again. This time there was no mistaking what was going to happen next.</p> <p>She pulled her lips from Mark’s and looked at him. As the kiss continued she pulled him toward her. He felt her tongue pushing against his lips. His cock started to respond and started to get a little harder.</p> <p>They continued the kiss as their kisses became more feverish and passionate. Both of them were breathing hard and trying to regain control. Mark felt Sarah’s hands on his ass and they pulled each other’s body towards them. He felt a strong hand on his butt. His cock was now standing stiff and up. It was a little uncomfortable, but it felt good.</p> <p>Sarah slid her hands along Mark’s back to his ass. She ran her fingers along the crack of his ass and then slid her hands back up to his shoulders. Sarah slid her hands down and grasped the front of his shirt. At the same time her lips were on his neck and she began to kiss his neck as he continued to work on getting his pants off.</p> <p>Mark was getting quite excited by now as the heat was building in their bodies. His cock throbbed more now that it was at full, hard length.</p> <p>Sarah pulled away to help him take off his pants and underwear. Mark removed his right shoe and took off his shoe and sock. Then Mark took off his pants and underwear. His shirt came off next. Sarah dropped to her knees in front of him and took his cock into her hands. She rubbed it up and down gently, causing Mark to moan softly. Mark’s hands reached down and found Sarah’s head.</p> <p>She let go of his cock and ran her fingers lightly over his balls. Mark groaned a bit at this. His cock jerked noticeably, and Sarah let go of his cock.</p> <p>Sarah wrapped her lips around Mark’s cock and started sucking it slowly. Mark closed his eyes and groaned softly. Sarah sucked on him, moving her lips up and down in between his shaft. Mark was breathing hard and getting a little worried.</p> <p>Sarah let her lips drop from his cock. Mark’s cock was now standing straight up. It was a hard shaft, but not too big around. His balls were small, but his cock was large and it throbbed in fact.</p> <p>Sarah looked up at him with those big brown eyes. He felt the heat in them. Her hands went up to her breasts. She cupped them briefly, then her hands came back down to cup his balls. She massaged them. Mark was getting hot again. He didn’t understand—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
