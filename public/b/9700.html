The house looked out over a small pond, and there were a number of people sitting on the grass. We were greeted by a male and female, who told us to come on in. We followed them inside.</p> <p>We walked around the house, and saw that there was one large lounge chair, on the side next to the fire. On a large table, were several small dishes, in several different containers. I found out that the lady had left a few dishes in the kitchen and was preparing dinner. This lady, who I figured to be a student from the town would bring these dishes into the house. We sat and enjoyed the meal. When we finished, we went outside, and started to make some more drinks.</p> <p>Soon all of the people were coming up to me, but it didn't seem to be a man. As I looked at this woman, she spoke for the first time, "You must be Jack. What are you doing here?"</p> <p>I replied, "Oh, just a friend of my uncle's. We had a lot of talking, and he asked where I was going to college; and, he gave me his number; so I called him today. We decided that we would be in town, so it wouldn't be a problem."</p> <p>She then added, "We're just visiting. We just came from the city. You don't live here now? How do you get here?"</p> <p>I answered, "We just live here when we come in from the rain, and live together."</p> <p>That broke the ice and we both started to laugh, she said, "It's really good to see you again; and thank you, again for everything you've done for me. You're not a stranger are you?"</p> <p>I told her, "No, no not a stranger. I got stuck for about 10 hours on my motorcycle. I got kicked out of a motorist's lane, and was suspended for about half an hour."</p> <p>She smiled, gave me a kiss, and said, "Thank you for trying. You don't have to leave or you don't have to leave, but you'll never see me again." Then she turned to me and asked, "Can we meet again, sometime?"</p> <p>I told her, "Yes, I have another friend that is about the same age as you. Her name is Beth." Then I got up to ask her what she and her lover must think of me if they are having sex.</p> <p>She smiled at me and said, "You're a nice one."</p> <p>"I'm not nice," I said.</p> <p>She said, "Yes you are but I think you like me." She then went towards the door and said, "No, please stay. Your friend should get up, before someone does something that she hasn't done before."</p> <p>I then asked, "Do you want some beer? I don't really like beer?"</p> <p>She laughed, and said, "It would be really fun, if that's what you mean."</p> <p>After we left, I saw her talking with that student, a pretty girl that I knew from school. She had long brown hair that she sometimes wore in an almost wavy fashion. She looked a bit like a young girl, but younger. She was wearing a short plaid skirt and a tight, white blouse that showed off her tight figure nicely. It was kind of a pity outfit. "I just like girls. Why don't we go see what else might be available," she said.</p> <p>I followed her to a couple of different places, but there weren't any beers in front. When we got back to the house, she asked, "Is there anything else you like to be doing?" She started to talk about her class again, but, instead, she took a pull of her own beer.</p> <p>I told her that there was nothing else we would like to do. I also told her that I'm also a virgin. I told her that I thought I could take a couple of guys to the bedroom on the condition that she went to bed with us.</p> <p>She told her, "That would be nice. But I'm not sure that I'm going, just like I said there would be. I know that I've been with a guy a couple of times, but this is a first."</p> <p>When we reached the bedroom, she went up to the bed, and laid down on the floor next to me. I saw her eyes looking up at me the whole time. She then reached up and put one ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
