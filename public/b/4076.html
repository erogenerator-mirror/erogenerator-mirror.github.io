The plane was a bit warmer than some of the jetways of our country but it was in a fairly normal sized room. The seat itself was the size of a beachhead with a small table in front of the two-seater and the windows were covered in a thin layer of a thick white film of fabric. It was also very comfortable. I had never seen a plane so comfortable when I was on it before.</p> <p>I was still in my clothes, only wearing a shirt and a pair of underwear which had to be torn off before we even got to my seat. I had to stop from looking as Mark made his way over to the door and I followed him with my eyes. He looked over at me and smiled.</p> <p>"Are you going into the bathroom?" I smiled back. He shook his head.</p> <p>"I guess they left the light on for when we were leaving."</p> <p>He didn't answer immediately but a little while later he answered for me. I just continued to watch as he took his shoes off. "Turn around," he said softly, his voice quiet as he leaned down to me on one hand and took the top half of my shirt in his grip. He pulled me towards him until his lips were just brushing against my skin.</p> <p>"Your ass is very nice," Mark murmured into my ear as he took a hand full of my long blonde hair and tugged. "Are you wearing a bra on top?" He asked a little roughly. It was very distracting.</p> <p>I giggled a bit as I slowly turned around. If I moved so much I would be facing the window and could be seen in a few seconds. I pulled my shirt back down and he stepped back and pulled my shirt back up, I held the bottom of my shirt in place for him and waited. In the middle of the room were two sinks, a couple of sinks to the side of the cabin and a shower. He pulled me forward until my breasts were only a couple a few feet from the two sinks. He reached up for each one, one at a time until they popped free from the thin material that had been covering them. I watched as he lifted each breast in his hands and put his one and then the other into his mouth. I pushed my chest forward to meet him and started to move my hands up to gently push him away from me. He pushed me back against the wall of the bathroom and looked at me with lust filled eyes.</p> <p>"Would you show me what you wanted?" He asked as I started to pull away from him. He stepped closer still and pressed himself against mine, my eyes drifted down to his groin.</p> <p>A long pause followed as I stared at the bulge in his pants and tried to see his dick. He stepped back a little and I felt as if someone had ripped my panties off and I was trapped as a prisoner. I let him pull them off and throw them on the sink beside the sink. He moved my shirt back and forth and my breasts moved and thrust down as he played with my body.</p> <p>"Your breast are very nice," he said softly as he looked at it for a moment. He lowered his eyes once again to my nipples as he moved the other breast up to his mouth. I felt it grow harder as he licked and bit at my nipple slowly. I closed my eyes in pleasure and let my head fall back. I spread my legs wide to give him better access and he started to suck at first slowly, taking his time but enjoying the full length of my breasts with each lick. My breathing started to increase as he took his time.</p> <p>I let my other hand fall to my waist as he leaned in towards my pussy. A couple of steps backwards, I felt his hands on my hips and I knew I would probably end up on my feet. He stopped and stepped back and I looked over at him. He smiled that smile and turned his head back towards the door. I knew I had let him down easy, he could still come. But in the end this was only going to be up to him.</p> <p>I took a step back and looked over at him. I couldn't help but notice his eyes looking down at my hand and the small patch of hair between my fingers as I slowly put my hand under my shorts. I felt his eyes move over from my hand and down my entire body as I moved my hand. I slipped first one finger lightly down my mound and then the other where I just lightly traced the ridges that covered them between my fingers. He groaned at the sight. I slid my fingers slowly and deliberately down my flesh, running them between my upper lips, teasing at my slit as I did soâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
