That's it; take off your coat; show me all that you have.</p> <p>Now do it, it'll be fun and not at all a chore at all.</p> <p>After hanging up your coat I reach out and caress your cheek as I slide your coat off of you. My hand slides along your arm as I walk you back to the table, my hand still on your other cheek. I look you squarely in the eye as I sit you down and we make small talk, your hands slowly caressing my calves, then under my skirt. I take my top of and it falls to our floor. I look at you again and you smile again, your eyes lingering a bit. My skirt is only about 5 buttons high on my thighs and you look up briefly before sliding it right off. I can feel the cool air on my bare pussy. I feel your hands roaming once again while we sit. I sit down and take yours from my lap, letting my skirt fall to the floor as I spread a hand and hand over yours. My hand slips under your short shirt and up your belly, my finger lightly sliding through your bellybutton then between your breasts, I feel the hard nipples under your shirt. I bring your hand up a bit so I can touch yours; we touch lightly, our fingers softly running across your chest.</p> <p>You raise your chin up to look at me. You've got that look about you, you're really in charge. All I can do is smile as you pull me down toward you.</p> <p>"I think that it's time we get started," I manage to say as I take my hands and slide your shirt off, my breasts pressing up into your chest.</p> <p>"I'm already wet," you say as you slide your hands slowly down my arms and across my body, your warm hands feeling against my tits, as you begin to tease my nipples through my bra. You slide my top up. Your hands slide down my back as your fingers pinch and squeeze my nipples through the tight material. I shudder and arch up to meet your soft strokes and you hear my moan of approval.</p> <p>"Mmmm . . . you're a naughty girl . . ." you say.</p> <p>My body shivers as you play with my sensitive nipples through sheer lace. You can feel my excitement rising as you slide across to sit on the edge of the big leather chair and slide me on top of you, my skirt riding up around my waist as we kiss. I feel your hard cock pressing into my pussy as we kiss and our hands squeeze each other as our tongues duel in hot lust. My hands slide to your shirt and slide along the soft fabric. I can feel your arousal in your cock, your hands cupping my breasts in your lap, your cock pushing hard into my pussy as we kiss.</p> <p>"God your nipples are so hard. Is there a way that I can get them?" you say.</p> <p>"I'm thinking of moving my hands down for you, but if you want to . . ."</p> <p>"Your hands are all yours," you say as you slide your hands under my skirt. You feel how wet my pussy is as you pull your hands away. "I can get these nice and wet, so that I could make myself cum with my fingers," you say as you slide your fingers up my body. Your hand glides up, your palm rubs up my clit as you slide your fingertips over it, your thumb sliding across it lightly.</p> <p>"Mmm, it's got to be about time this happened," I say.</p> <p>"Yes," you say as you push my legs wider; your hands slide back toward me and you raise them up so that I am on my knees. As your fingers slide up and down my pussy I look at you expectantly. I let my hands move over your shoulders as your fingers slide up my body, over my breasts and across to my hard nipples. My lips part as my tongue reaches out, slowly licks up the inside of your hand.</p> <p>"God," I think to myself as your tongue slides through my lips, flicking my clit as your fingers slide toward the wet warm lips of my pussy. I have to stop myself from saying yes so I can't. If there is even one thing on my mind right now, it's you licking me right out of me; it's all that and more that's on my mind. Suddenly, I almost come. Your tongue slides inside me again as your fingers slide in and out of me.</p> <p>"God yes!" I think as I start to squirm all over the place. Your fingernail slides up to my clit, as it slides under to play with it. My legs squeeze together as I come; your fingers are sliding up and down my pussy at the same time.
