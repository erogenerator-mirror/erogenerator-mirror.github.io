The woman, however, sat on the end of the couch, leaned against the desk, and began working on the computer. She was still wearing most of her makeup, which she was using to keep her face clear. Although she had been the only one wearing her makeup at the hospital, she made herself look very comfortable, her shoulders and back straight and her arms in front of her while she did her work. "Hi," she said brightly.</p> <p>"Do you remember what this is?" I asked.</p> <p>"No, but I guess I can remember."</p> <p>"I'm the best patient you'll ever have." The smile was dazzling and I knew, in my heart, that she really did remember.</p> <p>"Okay, so when you get done," she said slowly, "Are you on your way back?"</p> <p>"Yep—all the way!"</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>It was like Christmas, just one day to forget about it. We had all just gotten off the plane and come back to my place. We started to take off from work and went to my room, where I immediately went into my favorite shower stall and stripped and got into the shower. My mind was going through all the things I had been thinking of having the next time we met. I had always wanted to see my parents (and I always found it hard to do), but I just never did this before, which was a nice relief, considering my life was really turning sour right now. I really had a hard time believing I was actually about to meet her the way I wanted to and she was just so gorgeous, with amazing legs and feet and gorgeous eyes and perfect nose, and that lovely smile. It was so easy to forget: the fact that, if I had to call her "sweet" for the next time, would I be able to.</p> <p>I got out of the shower and dried off and went and got dressed. There was a table in the room where we all served lunch, but it was way too small for all of us. The other two tables were empty and when I got back they were packed, so we were all going in separate directions to eat. In my room I grabbed a towel from the linen closet and hung it up in the closet.</p> <p>"So, you guys will probably take the room over to the office, but I'm still feeling really low about it," I said.</p> <p>"You're kidding." She smiled at me sweetly and added, "Sorry."</p> <p>"You're not kidding, you're right." I was thinking very hard at that particular moment and asked her, "What, did you think I was going to be doing with the other two?"</p> <p>"I think that's going to be fine," she said.</p> <p>We took the elevator back to my floor and I unlocked the door and we got in. We had made love before and I had never been with any other woman except my girlfriend, but I just didn't know if I was going to feel like that with her. Even for me this was the first time we had ever been together in this short time.</p> <p>"Hey, you guys," she said. I looked up at her, "How about we celebrate our first wedding anniversary? We are going to celebrate it together tonight."</p> <p>"Sounds great! Are you joining us?" she said with a big smile.</p> <p>"No, sorry, I'm on break," I said, giving her a wink.</p> <p>"Great! We'll get there together tomorrow. I'm really looking forward to tomorrow," she said and gave me a kiss on the cheek, "How do you fancy going?"</p> <p>I told her I had a room in the back of the hotel, but probably would have to walk, so we decided to meet up at the other end of the hotel. We made our way up the elevator and were headed toward the room when she said, "You can be my first-in-law for a while."</p> <p>"I don't know. Probably a weekend," I told her with a grin.</p> <p>"Well, you'd better have the room in your name, so," she said with an exaggerated sigh, "It's not up in the tower on the fifth floor."</p> <p>"Sure it is. Where is it?"</p> <p>"Just around the corner away from the hotel, but I thought it might be fun."</p> <p>"Well that sure is fun. I'm really looking forward to it."</p> <p>When we got inside, I told her that it had been my first marriage and that I loved it very much. She was all excited and excited too and she looked incredibly sexy in her dress, which was all white and sexy. We were sitting on the king bed, which had its original mattress on the floor, on—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
