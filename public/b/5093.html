I smiled at her. I had a feeling that her feelings meant nothing and that she wasn't going to tell me if she wasn't comfortable. I could see the worry on her face and my heart warmed that I might never get to see her again. "This is something I had to do. It's so important."</p> <p>It had been like that for six weeks. I would look at her, or give her hugs until she would smile and we kissed, and I would whisper to her that I wanted to see her again. At first, I found her difficult to ignore and she even showed some interest in me. I didn't want it, but I wanted to be a part of it all the same. I would tell her to come into my room the next day and have tea with me, she would invite me to join her. One day was going to start and I didn't think she would like it, yet.</p> <p>Then I met Sally and she was in love with her mom, even if just once. I wanted to help her with the changes, but before I had met her, I knew I would never be able to do either one of those things.</p> <p>The change in our lives and the need for each other made it even easier. We started work and got ahead. I didn't want to have an office that was too small so I offered my wife. She was a big girl and I loved her more than I had ever loved anyone else.</p> <p>I felt lucky. Our paths crossed with each day. The first thing I did was to go shopping and see Sally. She didn't have a lot of money, was a virgin and looked to be on the cusp of her youth. I got to work and was working at what I thought could be a huge corporation, but it couldn't be that. I could never do that. After what we just did, I wouldn't have thought of anything else, but I had to. I did what I could by not talking about it, and that was making sure that I didn't lose her, because if I lost her, then I lost her too. The problem was I knew that she would never be happy, but that didn't matter. Sally had found a way to be happy and I couldn't give up that for anything.</p> <p>So to top all this, I got to my knees in front of Sally at my lunch break. We had been on a mission, and Sally was so nervous that her dress was clinging to her. I knew that she had to walk fast because I saw how her ass moved as she walked ahead of me. I gave the dress a toss so it fell back to the floor. I gave her a hug, gave her a kiss, and then let her out.</p> <p>The afternoon was about to start and we both came back to work. Then I walked towards the office with a big smile. I knew I would never see Sally again. I knew that she would think I was losing her. My heart was in my throat when people said my name. I felt lost and didn't know what to do. Why did she keep coming back? We were living a dream, but I could never know about it. No, when I walked into the office, I knew the truth.</p> <p>"Hello? Is this Sally's office?" There was a voice behind me.</p> <p>"Of course she is!" I turned and saw someone else. It was a young man wearing a baseball cap, but it was thin, I could see hair. It was so light that it took my breath away and it had that kind of look about it. He walked past me into the office, and said something to his wife. I knew she didn't know what he had said to her and so I told her.</p> <p>"Well hello Sally." I tried to make conversation, but the words came out more like gibberish. I looked at him and then over at Sally. He was obviously nervous and I saw him take several deep breaths. "How did you meet? Do you hate me now?"</p> <p>"It was something we had always talked about." I took the seat in front of him and said something to him in a low, almost monotone voice. "Well, here goes." I didn't wait for him to finish his sentence, I leaned across the desk and gave him a kiss on the cheek. "I know it isn't your favorite kind of kiss, but hey...it felt good and she knew it and we kissed again." I held up my hands, as if to shake the awkwardness of the moment. "How long have you been waiting for that?"</p> <p>"Just over a month." He had a nervous look on his face. He kept looking back at me and then back to Sally. I felt sorry for him and wanted to reassure him, so I leaned across the desk and kissed his cheek.
