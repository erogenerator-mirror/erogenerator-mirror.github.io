I followed her as she put on a light nightgown and took off her robe.</p> <p>My thoughts were all wrong. I was looking at nothing. My heart was racing. We walked into her room and she closed the door and threw the bedspread off the bed. She sat with her legs bent with her hands on her knees.</p> <p>I stared at her exposed body as she ran her hands over her breasts and down her belly, and down to her pussy. She rubbed her hands over her pussy and inserted one inside of her cunt. When she came it was violent. Her face was contorted with pleasure, her body was writhing and I saw that she didn't mean anything by it. She just wanted me to be here watching her. I watched her hand rub on her pussy as she climaxed.</p> <p>I was so lost in my thoughts to think what was going on.</p> <p>"What do you want to do now?" she asked walking over to me on her hands and knees.</p> <p>My mind was reeling with emotions, I was so overwhelmed with fear. This was all so unexpected and shocking. I just had to say it.</p> <p>"You know that this is your fantasy. I know a couple that like sharing a bed with others. So I guess that means we're sharing. If I really want this then we can. If she's OK with it then we're sharing it. However, if she says no, we are done. It's too late. Your fantasy's done," I said. I was trying to understand her as much as possible.</p> <p>"OK," she said. It was her turn to be nervous. Her skin was glowing. What's the matter?</p> <p>"You know that I like you now," I said kissing her on the neck.</p> <p>It felt good to kiss a woman, especially one who wasn't afraid of being kissed. Her body stiffened at my kiss and she pulled away from me.</p> <p>"Now," she said. "Get naked so I can get started," she said.</p> <p>And I did. I took her in my arms and she lay back and closed her eyes with the effort of not to be scared. I pulled up her night gown and laid her down on the bed. Then I had to tell her the difference between fantasy and reality. I explained it to her with so much meaning but nothing else.</p> <p>"You want to do the real thing now," I told her as I straddled her pussy facing her.</p> <p>My hand went under her pussy for a few minutes and found her clitoris. I was surprised to find her wet and turned on. I kept rubbing and squeezing her clitoris and she soon responded with a shiver and a slight hunching of her body downward toward me.</p> <p>"I'm ready," she whispered. "Do me now."</p> <p>So I was glad as I leaned forward on my forearms. I began to slowly insert myself into her. She was already wet. I stopped for a moment and looked at her with the expression that I see on the faces of everyone we've known. Her eyes were filled with lust; her face seemed to be burning with desire.</p> <p>"There's plenty of time for that," I continued.</p> <p>I continued in to my first long slow stroke. I had been in her many times but never did it last long. There was more urgency in my strokes.</p> <p>"Oh, I like it when you're inside of me," she said. "Oh, it's so good that it feels so good..."</p> <p>I was thinking this wasn't all a one time thing. I was already very close to my own first orgasm.</p> <p>"I'll be real gentle at first. I'll be real gentler too, won't I?" I asked her.</p> <p>She didn't answer. I started very short strokes. I wanted to make this very special for her. That was the most important thing to do and I knew that. I started out very slow but soon picked up the pace. All the time we were both watching each other intently. I was in that position for a long time until the excitement of the whole thing took control of me. I was holding her close to me as I entered her completely. When I went all the way in I would begin in an agonizing pace.</p> <p>I didn't see her move just her hands. She knew that I was in control. A few seconds later she pulled back and looked at me in the eyes.</p> <p>"Oh, it's so good for you," she said. "This feels so good, like you're filling me up really nicely..."</p> <p>I loved it when she got excited. She was a wonderful lover. My cock was as hard as it had ever been.
