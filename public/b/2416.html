I've got a pair of jeans and one of my baggy shorts on. I've been trying to get fit enough for tonight."</p> <p>"Don't let me get a piece of you," she said as she pulled off her tank top. She pulled off mine and I stepped down off the couch towards the floor. Her breasts almost brushed mine as the tank rode up. I grabbed her and pulled her against me and reached up to caress her face. She looked like her eyes had a life of their own. I felt a slight chill go up my spine as I saw her nipples grow stiff.</p> <p>"Migod, it's a big fucking deal for men to be thinking about getting in women's pants."</p> <p>"It's a big deal for some other dudes' cocks to have been thinking about getting one that's about as big as yours."</p> <p>I didn't really know where to put my hands. Her face was right next to mine and we just gazed at each other for a while, as our heart rates seemed to go up a little.</p> <p>"This isn't really happening any more is it?" she asked.</p> <p>"No I guess not," I answered.</p> <p>"I don't think I should be getting so nervous about it."</p> <p>"It's not anything you can do, you're just playing with me. It's just you're so cute and you are so beautiful I can't do any of it. Besides you're a beautiful guy and I don't care if the others think it's okay. It's just you."</p> <p>We stood and stared at each other for awhile. I thought I might reach out and touch her chest a little. Her eyes were closed as she was leaning back on the couch and her arms came up to cover her breasts. I don't think she noticed.</p> <p>"I think it's okay," I said. "It doesn't hurt a bit if we go out at night, there doesn't seem to be any harm done."</p> <p>"You're right," she said. "I'm going to take those off now so it's no big deal, but if it doesn't go so, I'll probably try for a couple pairs of old jeans and another tank top."</p> <p>"I'll take them off," I added.</p> <p>"No! Don't you dare. Let me fix you a drink," she said.</p> <p>"A beer would be nice," I said.</p> <p>I opened the beer and took a big breath. I looked around the room and took the seat next to her on the other end of the couch. While I took the other corner between us she took the glass and opened it. I took a small sip and turned it over. She held it up and we drank a toast.</p> <p>"That was a nice way to start the night," I said.</p> <p>"I could get used to seeing that look on most guys' faces."</p> <p>"But we can't do anything without being a little bit awkward so I'm sorry. I guess my big chest is okay but I don't think our physical touching could do any damage."</p> <p>"Okay. So why don't we go to your place and have some drinks. I'll have your body for a change," she said.</p> <p>"Is that what that sounded like?" I asked. Her eyes were closed again and I didn't know if it was because of my beer or if she was feeling herself up that much more, like someone getting a second wind. I wasn't sure and didn't know what to do. After a few minutes, I took a sip of the beer and we continued getting our drinks.</p> <p>"Why don't you take a shower with me? That way you can really wash off any smell from me," she said. I didn't know who else to ask. While I took another drink, she went straight to the bathroom. I waited patiently for her to finish washing off her shirt.</p> <p>After that I walked her down to the pool first and let her go. I walked her outside and watched her splash over the side.</p> <p>"I wonder if it would be okay if we went topless here sometime," she said.</p> <p>"You're right but this is my house and I'm just going to have to sit and watch."</p> <p>"I guess the beer bottle here is bigger," she said as she sat on my lap. I just smiled.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she said. "I didn't mean to. It's just that it has been a while since a man is here," she said.</p> <p>"You're probably right," I answered.</p> <p>After a few minutes of the pool, she slipped off her shorts and pulledâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
