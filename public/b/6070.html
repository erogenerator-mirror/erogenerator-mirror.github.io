That is why I was doing the dishes. I'm sure she thought I was an idiot to go without panties, and I'm sure that we've done that many times.</p> <p>"My goodness, you're just really naughty. You're acting like an embarrassed little girl, and now you're doing things with your husband like you did with Mrs. O'Malley."</p> <p>I tried to change the subject, but the conversation was getting in my head, and I just ignored her and avoided the topic.</p> <p>"What a naughty little girl," she said, and that seemed so strange that I didn't even flinch.</p> <p>She didn't say too much, and when I asked why didn't she just push those naughty thoughts off, she simply said, "My husband wouldn't approve - he and I have been married almost ten years."</p> <p>That sounded odd, and I'm sure the poor guy didn't know what to do. Well, maybe he'd be okay with it if she told him what he should do, too. I was in her family's kitchen, in her presence, and her little sister's room, so what I wondered.</p> <p>But after all this time, it seemed to me, that maybe she actually thought all the sexual things I said were just about talking about some of her past boyfriends, and she really seemed to like them. And what? Was we all some sort of "sexual pervert"?</p> <p>I'm sure it was a silly question, but I wanted to answer anyway, so I said maybe.</p> <p>"What is it, little brother?"</p> <p>"I was naughty. I was just doing some of it to please you."</p> <p>"No you weren't. And you're not doing it now," she replied.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," I said, looking over at her, "and what was naughty was thinking of you, and not thinking about us."</p> <p>She looked embarrassed. "I guess I wasn't thinking, but I liked it."</p> <p>"Yes, you did, didn't you?" I said, and then she put her finger to my lips and whispered, "I'll take you upstairs to help you - I just want to go to sleep and tell your father I have a surprise for you in his room - "</p> <p>"You can't," I said, "not your dad."</p> <p>"Oh no, brother, we will both help you."</p> <p>"No. You can't! Please don't."</p> <p>"Why not?" she asked. "Why wouldn't we please each other? Because you have, you just have. And you do so well with my daughter, and you'll be better off with me, and the other guys. Because if I was your boyfriend - well then, you're better off with me, and you'll enjoy it like you did with your own daughter ... and you know what I'm feeling, even if I'm married..."</p> <p>I was really surprised by her candor - she sounded so sincere - and for a moment I was convinced that she might have ulterior motives. She looked over at me and smiled again, although there was still some uncertainty in her voice. And then she said, "but maybe I was wrong. Maybe we should stop."</p> <p>"Maybe we should wait. Come on - you know you want to."</p> <p>"You know - I should - you'll be OK, I'll feel better, and you'll be happy."</p> <p>We both knew what I meant, and I felt happy. We weren't hurting - were we?</p> <p>So I said, "OK then - you're right. It's nice that I can be with you, so happy. I guess I do feel a lot better, if you really want to."</p> <p>The thought of us actually enjoying each other seemed to make her smile again. We didn't say a thing for the next half hour, and it was at that point that she suggested that we go to her room.</p> <p>"If we're going to do this, we'll take our clothes off, and we won't be naked," I said, after which we were both standing there completely naked.</p> <p>"Come, let's go downstairs," she said, and she pulled out her cell phone and dialed, but didn't wait for anyone else to ring before letting go, and we walked out to her family room.</p> <p>"They'll be here any time now - I can't wait," she said, as we stepped into the room.</p> <p>There was her father standing by the door - and just like when we were little, he smiled that same smile of excitement that I had felt, and then he led her to her father. He put his arm around her and kissed her, and she pushedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
