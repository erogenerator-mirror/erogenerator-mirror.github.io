He grinned. "Not tonight. I've got it all planned. We'll need it. But I don't want to stop it from happening."</p> <p>"So what are we doing?" I asked, feeling very naughty talking like this to a man like John.</p> <p>"Nothing."</p> <p>"Then what?"</p> <p>"We're ready."</p> <p>"Good!" He reached out tentatively and laid a hand gently on my chest. He turned me and sat me on the edge of the desk chair. His knee bumped my crotch and brushed my clit softly at first and then in short quick plunges.</p> <p>"That feels great," I agreed as I lay back on the desk with my arms wrapped around him. His body molded to mine, pressing his cock between us, and he moved his hips between mine, grinding and humping me at the same time.</p> <p>"Ah!" I moaned as he took my lips in a deep kiss, sucking my tongue between his teeth. His fingers tangled into my damp hair as his tongue lapped deep in my mouth and pulled my mouth toward him hungrily. He drew away slightly and gazed at me.</p> <p>"I'm ready." He whispered. His fingers were moving faster now, squeezing my hips gently and I arched my back, pushing my body against him. We both moaned together, but a deep and lusty growl escaped his lips with that deep animal voice of his as he pulled my hips toward himself, pushing hard against my clit in the process.</p> <p>"Please don't stop." I begged.</p> <p>"What does that mean?"</p> <p>"Please, fuck me!" I screamed. I was on the verge of losing my mind if he stopped right then.</p> <p>"I'm going to," he whispered hoarsely. "I've been horny for too long."</p> <p>He looked into my eyes as his face lowered into mine, his breath warm on my neck. I lifted my eyes and met his gaze. He was still moving against me, but in a faster rhythm. I felt my orgasm rise within me and my pussy walls clamped around his cock, pushing him over edge.</p> <p>"Ah!" I gasped as one last time I reached for him and kissed him. He held me tightly, as he moved and pulled away. I could feel the tip of his cock against my lips, slick with my juices. I held my breath and opened my eyes.</p> <p>I watched as the look on his face told me he was close. He was watching everything. I felt his fingers slide into my pussy, sliding in and out, pressing the outside of my swollen pussy lips. I could feel myself tightening around his cock and heard him sigh as he pressed it into me, deeper.</p> <p>"Ah! Ah!" I screamed as he slammed into me. His cock slid against my g-spot and I pressed back against the desk with each thrust. I felt his other hand tighten on my waist while his fingers stroked inside of me. I felt my pussy flood and clench as the orgasm crashed and raced through me.</p> <p>"Oh!" I cried, almost too loudly.</p> <p>With that my pussy milked and pulsed around his cock as the orgasm consumed me. I felt him thicken and his balls tighten. His cock exploded in me. His fingers clenched in my hips, holding me tighter and more firmly as he pumped and throbbed cum into my waiting pussy. My orgasm continued unabated, but I let him go, pulling myself off of him slowly.</p> <p>We spent minutes on the desk, holding each other, touching and kissing, but we both knew it was too soon in the world, for that. Just for the moment we would have been done. Nothing else we had done, apart from my wildest, passionate sex.</p> <p>Our silence filled with the promise of more tomorrow.</p> <p>*********</p> <p>That day went by fast. I tried to keep the day fresh but it felt like a blur. I couldn't understand it all, especially as my mind kept drifting back to John's big cock filling my pussy as he stroked himself. I kept thinking about what we did and who we let take him home, how it all made me so damned naughtyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
