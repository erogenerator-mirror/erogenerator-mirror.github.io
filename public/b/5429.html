I felt completely naked in front of her.</p> <p>Finally, the sensation faded and her voice spoke her thoughts.</p> <p>"Okay, honey, you can go now. We need to talk, we need to get things fixed and go, I think."</p> <p>I nodded and watched her walk to the door. Her back was turned, as she left me on my own. I watched her walk across the yard to her car and I closed my eyes and began to drift back to sleep.</p> <p>The next morning, I awoke to the sound of the door close as I realized that Cathy had slipped into bed next to me. Looking around, the bed sheets were tossed over us, but then I saw her face and saw her breasts. Looking up at her naked body, I thought about the last events. I had watched her with an open mouth, her open eyes as she tried to kiss me and suck me. I also thought about that look on her face when I had cum in her mouth and that, with some regret, I had cum inside her while on her knees.</p> <p>I rolled onto my back and closed my eyes and tried to forget again what happened from day one. My only thoughts on the morning was how I had wanted to spend the next 30 hours fucking naked in front of a woman.</p> <p>The day slipped by as quickly as it had and we made a lot of friends in the neighborhood. We had a very open relationship and Cathy was just as open about it with me. In fact, that has been a long time since Cathy has shared anything that we have done, anything she felt that needed to be shared but didn't want.</p> <p>We talked on Monday about the previous days' events. Cathy had always been a little shy around me and was always hesitant to talk about anything about anything that happened to us. After a few weeks, I had developed a confidence in this relationship and had decided not to try anything else. This was a change for both of us, but Cathy was still not sure of just how much we had in common.</p> <p>She had asked me to not let things become uncomfortable or awkward between us and on the Saturday that summer, she had spent an entire day out of town with her family.</p> <p>Cathy was not only comfortable where we stayed, but also seemed to be accepting of our relationship. I was beginning to think that maybe it was a little more than an easy lifestyle with a healthy level of sexual tension between us. I could see that she was still reluctant to talk about her sexual experiences. One day, however, she finally did ask me to stay with her for a few days. There was no way I was gonna say no after what happened that night, especially with her still unsure.</p> <p>That night, Cathy had been very nervous and apprehensive about being nude in front of another woman.</p> <p>"Just go slow," she had said. "I know you can help me."</p> <p>I had reluctantly gone down on her again and was so excited that the feeling lasted only a minute or two before I could not get it the rest of the night. My mind was swirling about that feeling and I had decided to push the envelope. But, I knew that I wanted to share that night with her.</p> <p>I was feeling an uneasy feeling inside and a bit guilty as well. I felt guilty that I was being so good to her as much as I could be with my own body and that I was taking the initiative to do this for her. What I was seeing was a chance to be much more intimate with her, but I felt that was a little over the top.</p> <p>I felt guilty about not being able to have sex with her in the manner that she had wanted and that I didn't feel as comfortable about it as I usually did. In fact, in many ways, I wanted to do more than just have sex with her and make oral and intercourse with oral sex. I wanted to see to her well-being, and I liked the fact that I could have some control of her and would not be losing control of myself. However, I also liked the fact that I was enjoying being that way.</p> <p>I told her once that she was my queen, so I didn't really feel as self-conscious about the fact that I was nude in front of another woman. I had been thinking about having sex with her once but that was just a fantasy. However, I had been wondering what it would be like to make love to a woman and to experience a full, natural and complete relationship with her.</p> <p>I also told her that I wasn't a total fool that was looking for sexual fulfillment, at least not like I wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
