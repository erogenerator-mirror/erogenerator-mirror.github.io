I turned around to face the crowd but the singer stopped me again.</p> <p>"We're going to dance, dance, dance, dance and when we get back to our table we're going to play each other a few more songs."</p> <p>I danced with them, all five of them on stage. I even got my hands on them and I squeezed a bunch of their asses before standing up and putting my arms around each of them. That got them laughing. My arms fell and I was still in a high, happy glow.</p> <p>I made my way back to my table and all the girls were still laughing when we were sat down. After a couple of glasses of champagne, a nice slow song came on.</p> <p>While the songs were slow I got up the courage to dance with each of them, all five of them at least once a night.</p> <p>I found the four that I hadn't taken the time to dance to and all of them were sitting, dancing away on the stage. The four girls were in a conversation, dancing like it had been my fault but as soon as I sat down they were still dancing.</p> <p>As soon as I sat the fourth and fifth songs on they disappeared. One by one the entire table vanished.</p> <p>The two girls left the table and walked back to the bar. The one between the two stood up and the other, the one between the three stood up and took her drink. Then they turned and started moving around the stage taking turns dancing with me. When I reached to get her drink she leaned in and kissed me. I was a bit shocked as I opened lips to her and she kissed me back. I didn't realize it but she had opened her lips and my tongue was out.</p> <p>She kissed me again. But this time as she kissed me I opened my mouth to accept her tongue. We kissed and we kissed until it was getting hard to breathe. I tried putting a hand behind her head but she pulled her face away.</p> <p>"No, don't stop," she said and started dancing with me again.</p> <p>I looked over at Toni and she was looking at me with a look that was very strange. I looked over at Beth as I pulled her a bit tighter. She started dancing with me and I couldn't really see what she was doing, even though she was leaning against me.</p> <p>The singer asked me what I thought of the song. I said it was not very sexy.</p> <p>The singer looked at me and we looked at each other then her eyes turned to me.</p> <p>"The song's a little softer but you guys should really get better dancers," she said with a twinkle in her eye.</p> <p>As if that were possible it made me feel better like I did. I looked at Beth again and she was smiling at me while I was looking at her. The singer asked Beth what she thought about the song. That caused me to start moving my hips in all directions to get closer to Toni.</p> <p>I saw that Beth's eyes were smiling at me and her smile slowly disappeared. She got up off the stage giving us an excuse.</p> <p>The owner of the bar approached the bar and asked how my wife was doing. "I guess I need some help," he said and went inside.</p> <p>"She did okay," Toni smiled to me as she pulled in my lap. I couldn't take my eyes off Toni and when she came back to the table I didn't want to look back.</p> <p>"Is she really happy? I'm sure she would tell the world that."</p> <p>The songs came on and the three dancers were back with three more girls dancing while we danced.</p> <p>My mind was a blur. When the song ended it was like a dream that I had that I couldn't remember. All I could think was how good I had felt when I danced with Toni. I looked at Toni and she was smiling at me. I was just at the same spot again thinking about where we had gotten off to.</p> <p>My whole world exploded when the singer asked what I wanted to hear about the song.</p> <p>"Just listen," I heard her say before I looked away.</p> <p>"Oh! How you doing?" my wife asked.</p> <p>"You mean this song? It's good?" Toni asked.</p> <p>"Yes it is," she said smiling.</p> <p>"What's this all about?" my wife said smiling as if I were nothing.</p> <p>"It was about how much it makes me happy," she said and went to one of the other girls.</p> <p>"It sounds like sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
