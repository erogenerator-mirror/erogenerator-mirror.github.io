I've been with more women now than I could handle before but it was always about sex. I've been having sex with a lot of men now, especially now that I'm in my early days. I'm not a whore. I just do this to make money for rent and food or I think about it for a while. It's not something I do to keep my family's money. I like having sex so much though. I just like it and do as little as I can. I don't worry about money in the least. We're good for each other now I guess.</p> <p>When I was in high school I'd never even considered hooking up to hook up with another woman! Not really! I'm not very good either. I try to hide that. Just a lot of people think I'm a slut. Well yeah, I don't care if I'm in drag. I just want to be a whore. It's how I keep my dad happy. Well, my father's happy. Dad always has been happy. He didn't stop trying to be the father of my baby in high school. My mother always thought it was just to keep him happy and she never did anything for me. I think the only thing she ever really cared for was the money.</p> <p>Well back then I was never good for dad. That was never one of dad's big problems though. He loved me, but I didn't want him to feel like I was just his sex toy. He wasn't really a good dad, but he certainly loved me and he gave me everything I wanted.</p> <p>I remember when dad gave me my first orgasm with my brother Bill. That was my first time. Well, that was my first experience with another woman! That's not exactly true! In fact, the only reason I ever did that was that I never told my dad. I still have that memory.</p> <p>Anyway, that was dad's first time. I had one of the best orgasms my entire life. I came so much I thought I was going to pass out.</p> <p>I remember it wasn't about being a good girl. My dad didn't love me. I tried to tell him I liked him, but he wouldn't listen. He always called me a whore. I was a prostitute, but I was really a good whore who gave good sex to her own customers. I would do whatever I could to make him happy. I just didn't know how.</p> <p>My dad did love me. Then, about all of this, some time after my mom was killed in a fire, my dad found a new job and took me. It wasn't his doing, but his having his way with me.</p> <p>My dad had gone to a different town in the South then. Well, my dad came to town. He was the only one of my step parents that had a house. We lived in one bedroom and had a spare room in the attic. I had a room in the bathroom. We went to a restaurant to eat our food and then some. It just didn't seem to bother dad. He was happy with me.</p> <p>I thought he always loved me. I guess it was because his first time was with me. I thought maybe, just maybe, in time, his feelings would change. The time came when I found a guy named Jim. He did everything for me. It wasn't until Jim had been eighteen that dad let me know that Jim was looking for a job. He was a nice looking guy and I was sure I was pretty and that he had a nice sized cock. Jim didn't want to give dad a bad time. He said that for daddy's sake. I couldn't believe it.</p> <p>I never really thought about dad being a bad guy. Of all the things dad was willing to do for Jim, I think it's probably about most of them. He wasn't willing to give dad the bad news about the size of his cock. Dad never liked to admit it so it was always "No, that's not really what dad wanted". I liked it, but Jim got a lot more of his money doing what dad wanted to do. He loved my dad more than anything in the world so he made a lot of money.</p> <p>Jim was a good looking guy. I was so sure that he loved me, but I never knew if he truly loved dad. Anyway, Jim was interested in trying to get a real job. So, when he found a good job I guess my father had been getting more interested in Jim's business and more interested in my dad. Jim was always smiling, never looking as much as dad. Sometimes, I wish I could have been him and found dad a real man. Jim had a funny way of saying things about dad.</p> <p>Dad always said Jim was a nice looking man and could talk to me without saying too much. That's allâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
