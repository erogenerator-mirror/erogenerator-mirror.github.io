Would you consider seeing some of my outfits and lingerie on the web?" The second she asked me that her answer was exactly what I was hoping for.</p> <p>I quickly responded by saying, "I'd love to and we will see you later, " I told her, "Now, when I come home, I want to see if my panties are on the web.</p> <p>The next day, Saturday, I knew at the gym that I was going to have to be extra careful because my panties are just too thin to put in a bag without a safety belt. That made it a little easier for me and even made me feel pretty relaxed and even more sexy.</p> <p>After a brief workout in the weight room, I decided to wear the bikini that I had on last week, the one that had come with a black and red corset. For a brief moment I thought that perhaps I could make time to make out with her on the dance floor to keep myself cool, but then, I started the clock and smiled while pretending that she was dancing in her bikini; a thought that only went away because of how well I had planned.</p> <p>At three she came to the door, smiled at me as she put on the corset, and hugged me tight. I felt her tongue on my ear and kissed her neck like an ailing puppy after it had run under a car on a summer afternoon.</p> <p>"Let's walk to the bar, " she said, "you're not going to be able to drive until now but, as long as you get over there, I'll be happy to entertain you."</p> <p>We stopped at the bar then ordered drinks and sat down to talk. As soon as I picked up the phone, I heard a familiar voice on the other end. "I'm glad you decided to wear such a sexy outfit now that you can look at me wearing it now," I said, "My name is Joe and I'm your driver tonight." I heard her say, "Oh, I'm sorry, Joe, I thought that you might be a little shy."</p> <p>"I just can't exactly let myself go so far," I answered. "We've agreed to this so, I'll just put my seatbelt on and follow you." I pulled the seat belt away from her and got up to get our drinks.</p> <p>As I started to turn away from the bar, she said, "What if I don't like this?" She reached out and took my hand and placed it on her thigh, "That's ok, you can take it." I hesitated briefly and then decided to leave it on her. "If you want me to stay or go to my apartment without driving, I'll stop by any time and pick you up."</p> <p>She smiled again as she said that, "You know, I'm not that kind of girl." I didn't know what to take of that. That was exactly what she wanted but, to put myself in this situation was certainly a step forward. I knew it. However, I was not yet brave enough to drive myself home so soon.</p> <p>"I want to see what you can do for me," I said as my hand slipped off her thigh. "We have to try to get to sleep when we get home."</p> <p>"I'm sure we can do that," she said, "I'm in no hurry to get to sleep though." She put her hand on mine and pressed it to her thigh. "I can't get enough of this. I just feel so excited to see how you'll be wearing it when we finally get home and I'll see that."</p> <p>"I could get a room at an inn or a motel right about now," I said as my hand gently cupped her crotch. "I'm still a little nervous but that means I have to keep thinking about it."</p> <p>"You know what I love about you," she said as she began to unbutton her shorts, unzip her pants and pull them down. She then lifted one of her feet into the air a little as she pulled her panties off. She then turned back towards me and pushed my hand down between her legs and began to rub her pussy.</p> <p>"I can't go to my apartment without thinking about that as well," I said as I rubbed her pussy for the first time. "Can we stop right here, on the corner of Main Street and Eighth?"</p> <p>"Ok," she said with a smile, "that gives me plenty of room to go and the rest of the way I can just keep the corset on." She turned back to me as we talked, "Do you want to see the camper or the cabin, or should we go back and finish our drinks?"</p> <p>"Let's go in there," I answered "it would probably be bestâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
