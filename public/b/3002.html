They had a three year relationship at least six years ago. He was her first partner until recently. It is almost like old times or at the very least "old times" when we met at a barbecued steak house. We are quite the match in those times. He is the "second mate," her second lover, and she had him for almost 10 years before they met and before he made an effort to become a third partner."</p> <p>The conversation continued over coffee and later as we drove to the house. I had no idea why she had called him that. We arrived at the house and then proceeded to the front door and then opened it for her as we descended.</p> <p>We stood kissing as she led me toward the den where her lover Mike and her husband Steve were there. I was amazed at how wonderful he is and how easy he is to please.</p> <p>Mike is sixty-four and in good shape. He still has a full athletic man's body. He is lean but muscular. He knows how to massage women so he can maintain his erection long enough to make love to her.</p> <p>We took the love seat as the lights dimmed until at the appointed moment it was time for one more round of mutual oral sex.</p> <p>Mike stood with his hand behind my head guiding my mouth to him. He was fully erect with more than half of him in view. He was as anxious about sucking me as I was for him to be.</p> <p>His hand was guiding mine as I knelt on the love seat as his penis head was still very erect. I could feel his pulse in my hand but could not get the fullness it had to offer. The whole time his fingers were holding my head, holding me against him. He was moaning as his erection approached.</p> <p>I took it in my hand and guided him in to me. He was about to blow and then backed off and then drove home. He kept moving his hand slowly, not wanting to have to go through with this particular "first" coupling. "God how he wanted me to fuck him, suck his cock, fuck him," came to mind.</p> <p>When his climax approached, I felt his erection swell. He wanted me to swallow his cum so he did. He then pulled back and aimed his shaft toward my mouth where my mouth opened to let him slip in.</p> <p>He groaned as he ejaculated into me as the head was pushed hard against my throat as the shaft pushed past the entrance. I was not so much gagging as I was swallowing. It was a large ejaculation from Mike to my mouth but I didn't choke. I was surprised at how much cum he had. My throat was full of his sperm so he stayed still. He was still hard.</p> <p>He held his soft cock in front of me as I looked at him. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. We kissed again a moment then the kissing intensified. I wanted him to be totally involved in my sensuality.</p> <p>Our bodies became intertwined as our mouths and tongues continued to play and explore. The kiss was almost continuous. I was kissing him back but also holding him while I moved my body to bring him in close.</p> <p>There we were, kissing like lovers, kissing as one, our bodies moving to a gentle but steady rhythm.</p> <p>After several minutes Mike stopped but remained hard. He said nothing. He looked down at me smiling and he was grinning again. I smiled back.</p> <p>Mike held me firmly so his penis was still semi erect. It was a wonderful feeling. I felt I was safe, protected, and being the "first" partner to a man.</p> <p>He turned me around and slowly and carefully entered me again as we continued to kiss and caress. It was a marvelous experience. I wanted it never to end.</p> <p>I pushed down on his cock to have him as deep in me as he was. I wanted to feel his hot penis in me. He slowly moved in me until his testicles touched my ass cheeks and then he began kissing me again. After several minutes of that he began to move on me in gentle rhythmic motion. His penis made love to my body at times he had me in the missionary position with me on top.</p> <p>I knew Mike was close and I moved my body a little so his penis would be in me. His mouth was still on my face and we kissedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
