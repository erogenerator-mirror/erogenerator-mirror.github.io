This made me laugh a little but not much else. He had actually been good that day but I found out later that his meeting had also gone well. Not only that – we hadn't even fucked one time and didn't even bother to go further. But in fact we had actually had quite a lot of sex which he thought was incredible but we could still have really enjoyed it. I told him so the next day, then, although he still had the time to fuck me and have another go with me I didn't actually tell him I wanted to fuck you."</p> <p>"What did you do?" I asked.</p> <p>"Well, I came round for a bit of a laugh."</p> <p>"Ah, I guess he did too. Well no one else said anything."</p> <p>"Oh, you could say that, he just didn't want me to be angry with him.</p> <p>"Oh I'm sure he wouldn't." I told her. "I think some of the other people would have been too. I just hoped."</p> <p>"So if he had taken my advice and asked me rather nicely, but no that didn't happen because he was busy fucking you or something else?" I chuckled.</p> <p>"No. I was too excited to care. That was for you. You were right. It did sound like fun.</p> <p>"And you, the horny slut who was getting fucked senseless, well, I enjoyed it also and although I still didn't want to do it again, I did really like seeing and feeling you do that and I wanted to do that again, and again." Sarah sounded excited too, her voice had gone quite faint. "That's why I went along with Dave."</p> <p>"I'm sure you did, honey. He got your tits out, and then fucked your wet pussy for a while, really good. I loved everything about that. And the fucking was great too. Not to mention I enjoyed it too, being fucked by Dave. Your pussy was so wet that you could have really done with it, all that sucking and biting that was nice too."</p> <p>Sarah looked at me and smiled. "Oh, Dave, that was fantastic, and he did fuck me too, really good, very nice and gentle though."</p> <p>"You enjoyed it – you really enjoyed it. Well, wasn't it nice?"</p> <p>"Mmm, really. When I thought you were asleep, he didn't stop. He was really, really gentle."</p> <p>"I liked being fucked really well. My pussy was actually twitching inside when he did and I even felt it tightening up some now, I was so aroused." It was hard to tell but there were tears in her eyes.</p> <p>I nodded and pulled her into my arms and held her. I could feel that she was trembling, her hands were still in my lap. I stroked her hair and kissed her. I looked at the love in her eyes. I thought she was smiling back – so happy she was now, for my sexual pleasure. That's when we kissed. I held her and she held me as we came together. Then we held each other and fell asleep together.</p> <p>*</p> <p>The next morning at breakfast Dave said, "Sally we need to run over something, it's not just the way it seemed to be yesterday."</p> <p>"Sure," I agreed, "I'm going to be busy a while and you've got tomorrow to finish the washing and to get the iron and the things out of the washing machine."</p> <p>"Oh, the iron is going back to the washing machine in the morning too."</p> <p>"Yes, I'm sure there will be plenty more before that," I suggested.</p> <p>*</p> <p>After leaving the house after breakfast John, Sarah and I took a bath together and we used the sink. Then we all went into the bedroom and I turned on the light. John watched me for a moment, then climbed between Sarah's legs. I stood and watched him as he moved forwards. He slowly slid the tip into her wetness. Then he pulled back out and slowly pushed it back in again.</p> <p>Slowly at first he pushed and her eyes were closed as he did so. He then had the full length of his hard cock inside her in one slow lunge. Sarah gasped when it was again as far as it would go. I smiled at John in the doorway.</p> <p>"I guess we both knew you were going to enjoy it," I said, "I'm going to make sure you both enjoyed the experience."</p> <p>Sarah looked at me – then at John, then back to Sarah and finally to me. I felt Sarah tense then relax. She looked relieved and looked even younger. She just looked at me.</p> <p>"It feels good to be in my lover—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
