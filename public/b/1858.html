As my arms reached out, she leaned forward to help unhook my bra, freeing my breasts. Her mouth was warm and her tongue was like an onshore breeze, licking and sucking on my nipples before she released them. With my head thrown back and my eyes closed, I took in the sight of her slender legs as she slid down to my legs. When they came to rest at the top of her legs, she spread my legs, and brought her face down to that hot, wet spot.</p> <p>We kissed, tongues dancing and twisting with lust and desire, and our moans were nearly drowned out by the sounds of the crowd, which were now making every cell in the arena alive and raunchy and racy and wild.</p> <p>She was kissing my clit, and running her fingers up and down my pussy lips, and it must have had the desired effect because she had no trouble sliding two of them all the way into me. It felt as soft and hot as when she first started, and she made sure to be able to stroke the parts with slow deliberate strokes.</p> <p>I couldn't hold back the sudden jolt that began in my groin. She pulled her mouth away as my head swam and my eyes shot wide open. "Ohhhhh!" I screamed, grabbing her face in my hands and turning it towards my face. "What on earth is wrong with you!"</p> <p>She grinned at me, her eyes bright and glowing. Her face was wet with my juices and her breath was hot on my face as she smiled devilishly. "I've been dreaming about doing this with you for weeks."</p> <p>It took a second for my brain to process the realization, but then it kicked in again. I was sure I had just experienced a world-class climax, with the most incredible feelings running through my body. "Holy shit!" I blurted out a few minutes later, when she pulled away, breathing hard between our kisses. I had no idea how to reply to that, or why I was even thinking of doing this in the first place.</p> <p>After a couple of more kisses, she released my face and sat back with her hands on her knees. I could tell her stomach was a little pink from her excitement and I realized that she had been in such a state for sometime that it was almost aching for some type of attention. She smiled and stood at the center of the big stage. She was wearing her long auburn hair, and she moved to stand beside the center line, still holding onto the arms behind me, and leaned over to kiss my cheek. "I've got to get back to practice," was all she could say when she turned and walked out into the arena, not even looking back at me.</p> <p>I took a deep breath, and walked up to the center line of the stage. I sat down in one of the seats, right in front of that huge red box at the back, with one arm draped around my thighs. My other arm fell onto the floor, and I was surprised to find another woman at the opposite end holding my arm.</p> <p>"So," another voice was suddenly said. "Who is it?"</p> <p>"It's not your job to tell. It is a professional looking woman who is in the spotlight tonight. What are you doing here?" I asked.</p> <p>"She wants to make introductions before we start."</p> <p>"Ah. So she's my assistant?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Well this is what happens. I think you can guess."</p> <p>"Well I was just wondering what you've all been doing with your lives..." She looked me in the eye for a moment before turning back to the box with a smile on her face. Then she reached up, and undid the button on her jeans and pulled her zipper down as she did so. I could almost feel her heat from where I was sitting, my back against the wall, staring at her.</p> <p>Finally after several moments of my being transfixed, the zipper began to go down, and my hand came up to brush against the side of her thigh. "That would be my personal assistant, right?" She nodded and I could feel her breath on my face. "The lady has a very sensitive skin and probably is in a lot of pain as it's been burned before." I saw a smile play around her lips as her eyes slid to my crotch, which was still clad in my jeans. "We're supposed to meet on the dance floor, and that is where we come in contact. This lady wants to make a first impression."</p> <p>I looked around, hoping no one else ever came the same place as my new employee. It felt strange, and a little awkward, to see her soâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
