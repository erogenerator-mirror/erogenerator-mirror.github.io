And to add to the awkwardness, it was as if someone's eyes had been closed when they were open. I turned as I looked to her and, for a moment, saw that look. A look of deep regret... one that I didn't think I had the courage to show in my heart. There was a look in her eyes that was as if it was in mine.</p> <p>"I love you!"</p> <p>"Then just go away."</p> <p>She said it with such force that it had me in awe. I turned around to leave and stopped abruptly when I saw her looking at me.</p> <p>"Wait..." I began.</p> <p>"No!" She replied, standing up. This time, she turned and faced me. I saw the strength in her eyes as she turned away from me. "I... I don't want to see you again..." And she turned and walked away. I sat in shock and a sinking feeling that I couldn't hold her any longer. I walked over to the window to see my wife walking out of the room as she went. I stared back into the house and started calling her name as I stood there.</p> <p>A few minutes later, I walked up to my bedroom door and listened to her say "I couldn't."</p> <p>"Is that why I called to come over?" I asked myself. It was hard to think about anything else, but I needed to see if she had changed her mind about me. I was trying to figure out how to act, but the sudden silence would probably ruin the result. If I kept listening, I might still hear a conversation, but that would probably just make things worse. Maybe it'd be good for me in a strange way.</p> <p>I heard the front door open and then close. She stepped into the room, and I could hear her get close to me - just before she stopped. It sounded like she got close enough to touch me. I felt my stomach begin to drop in anxiety, and it made me want to reach out and touch her. I tried to find a way to get a grip and maybe talk her out of it. But again, no movement on her part. What was the point? I still needed that to take a hold of her, and I knew that, if I had to, I needed to be with her, that we could stay friends forever.</p> <p>"Oh, hey! Hey- there, there- there!" I heard her say as she walked to the couch in front of the door. She smiled at me, then continued on her way. I was about to turn towards the doorway, when I took a deep breath and went to say hello.</p> <p>"Yeah, what can I do for you?"</p> <p>"This is nice," I heard her reply. "I'm sorry that I ran into you there. It was not nice. I can't, I'm too tired and it's too early to make it to the next bar."</p> <p>"There's an empty bar in the back. I'm in the back."</p> <p>"Cool. I'll come get you in a few minutes. I've only got a couple of hours and I'm not sure what to do."</p> <p>She looked at me with big, sad eyes. I could understand her situation, but she wasn't right for me and I had to see that there was some kind of understanding there. "You don't have to go... you have a long drive tomorrow and you have to be here at 9."</p> <p>"What? Where are you going?" She said, taking a step toward where I was sitting against the wall by my dresser.</p> <p>"Well... I want a ride home if you don't mind."</p> <p>"I'm not going anywhere!"</p> <p>"No, you're not. I am going home. I'm your wife."</p> <p>"I couldn't... you said you'd never go back... that we could stay friends forever, you know."</p> <p>I didn't say what I meant by that. It seemed that this time, that she was right. If I didn't know better, I think I may just have made a little more sense. So to show that her fears weren't all mine, I took my hand from the door handle and pulled out the keys from my pocketâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
