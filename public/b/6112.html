We came by to talk about what you've been doing for the last two years after John died. I hope you enjoyed it. We're just not in full agreement on the love in love thing…so don’t be shocked if a piece of each of your favorite couples experiences ends up together someday. Are you interested?”</p> <p>“Uh yes I am.”</p> <p>He continued, “How about you? Can you handle him doing anal?”</p> <p>She hesitated, “How should I handle it?” .</p> <p>He said, “You sure. You've got a very beautiful body, don’t you?”</p> <p>“Yeah I'm sure.”</p> <p>She said, “What if he feels uncomfortable?</p> <p>He said, “Don’t worry, I don’t mind. Let’s try it one night.”</p> <p>Before she had a chance to say anything else, her hand grabbed his prick. He smiled in an impish sort of way and pushed her off of him before she could react. She looked at him in shock. She wanted, needed his dick in her cunt, but she was scared of him. He smiled again and said, “Honey, I don’t want to hurt you.” He put his hands on her tits and held them firmly.</p> <p>She said, “What?”</p> <p>He said, “You can stop acting so afraid.”</p> <p>She said, “What?”</p> <p>He said, “Relax. The worst thing that could happen is not having to do anything once you get married.”</p> <p>“You’re serious?”</p> <p>He said, “You bet your lovely ass I am. The fact that you can tell all you want by now is exciting me greatly.”</p> <p>She wasn’t too sure of his language, but she said, “Ok, I’ll go along with his idea. What do you feel?"</p> <p>He said, “Let’s just say this. I don’t have to make all the decisions. It’s up to him, but I have a strong feeling about his sex life and that he has a thing for the blonde in high school.”</p> <p>She said, “Hmmm…sure. Is it a sex thing?”—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
