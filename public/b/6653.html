I ignored it just so I could put the message through to my mom. 'Oh good, you're here babe!...' I heard his tone but I couldn't remember exactly what he meant. As I picked up my phone and began to read my mom's text, I knew she was talking to me; from the way my face was reddened.</p> <p>I smiled to myself as I finished reading the message. I reached my mom's room and knocked on the door. The door to the master bedroom opened and there was my mom. What the hell was that?... I didn't know what was going on. She didn't seem to be in a serious tone.</p> <p>"Can you come in please?... It's like I told you we talked on the phone... I'm sorry I sounded so angry... I told you I wanted to see you... What did you say?"</p> <p>I just looked at my mom as she sat in the chair next to the bed. She was dressed in a loose fitting yellow business skirt. It didn't seem that long, but it did reveal a lot of thigh. She wore a cream colored blouse and it looked like she didn't work at it very much. She turned to look at me and I saw her eyes dart to my lap. I turned away for a second and then back away from her. My mom must have seen the movement in my eyes and she said sarcastically, 'Look you stupid son of a bitch, you told me to have sex with his boss or something... You think we can just hang out...?' She looked at me again and then over to the floor.</p> <p>I continued to make eye contact as I watched my mom's face. A part of me really wanted to run downstairs and run from her room. Why could I have this anger, this disrespect for her? Yet more part of me didn't want to be responsible for what happened right in her living room.</p> <p>'What is this about?' I thought as I kept trying to read her mind.</p> <p>'What is he thinking' I wondered. 'What is he doing here?' My mind raced with the scenarios that were playing out in front of my eyes. I turned and began to walk down the hallway. I had no idea how much time went by before my mom was out of view.</p> <p>I reached the living room and entered. Mom was sat on the couch. "Hi mom, you've finally caught up to me."</p> <p>She looked at me for a long second and then smiled as I walked over and sat down on the couch with her. "I saw the message on my phone and told you to come over here for a repeat performance."</p> <p>She looked down and I could see that she wore a sexy smile on her face. "How did you do that?" she asked.</p> <p>"It's not the talking stage," she said as her eyes dropped to my lap. "I wanted you two to think that you were alone at your mother's house for the weekend."</p> <p>"Why are you standing there talking to me while you're thinking that?" she asked.</p> <p>"I can't believe you're acting so calmly. You look like you're angry because of what just happened in your neighborhood," I said as I crossed my legs.</p> <p>"It's my fault for bringing things all this way. I guess you know there's no point in taking back those phone calls, but this might give you a chance to explain to me why you were acting so mean to those guys you had talking to." She spoke so softly that I actually felt it in my voice.</p> <p>"Please don't be angry. It's nothing personal," I said softly as I tried to put some space between us.</p> <p>"Of course it's nothing personal. I knew we were going to have a lot of work over the weekend. I just wanted to make sure you wouldn't lose your temper." She said as her hand grabbed my leg and began to squeeze it lightly. I began to sit back down but my mom interrupted me.</p> <p>"I'm not taking it the wrong way," she said firmly. "Just remember that it's not like we talk or anything. I just wanted to get to know you better."</p> <p>"Okay," I answered.</p> <p>"I'll see you on Monday," she replied as she stood and walked to her door. I stared at her butt as she walked out. "What is your feeling about this?"</p> <p>"I don't think the thought of having sex with your boss was making me feel like this." I said as I pulled back the couch cushions and laid down on my side to put my head on the cushion.</p> <p>"Well you should've let it rip when they got your address out of mail or something," mom suggested.
