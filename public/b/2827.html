He moved slowly towards my mouth as his cock slipped down and slid along the outside of it. As he was near my face, I reached up with my hands and began to play with his nipples. He leaned back against the edge of the table as I worked around them, giving them little tickles of sensation.</p> <p>"Would you like to rub them for us?" He was leaning back a bit when I spoke this time, smiling at how easily this could happen.</p> <p>"Oh yes!" I answered.</p> <p>With that, he began to roll me over, bringing me down onto my back as well. We were facing each other again, his hard cock now pressed against my pussy, still sliding against me as he lay back down on the table. His cock slid up and down my lips slowly, then stopped as if waiting for me to say something. The smile returned to his mouth a moment earlier. "I like to see you do it," he said.</p> <p>"Do I?" I wanted to go along with it, wanting this moment to last even longer than it had to.</p> <p>"I like to see you do it!" he answered. "I'd love to give you a show, but I've got to warn you; I'm not doing anything unless you want it, no matter how long it takes." With a wink, he continued to slide himself slowly along my lips.</p> <p>"I think I'm going to be sore tomorrow!" I couldn't wait, hoping it didn't ruin our marriage.</p> <p>"I'm afraid you might. The reason I had to pull in a favor with an old friend is this: I was thinking that if we did what we decided we would," he told me. "Don't worry, you're going to get used to doing that."</p> <p>He slid himself down a bit, sliding his arms up my legs as he spread mine out and began to slowly work himself in towards the top of me. His cock was now pressing against his, spreading my lips apart as he slid back down a second time. It wouldn't be long before he was all the way in me.</p> <p>"Are you ready to give it a try?" he asked. He was pulling his cock away from my pussy a bit as he positioned myself there and then, just like last time.</p> <p>"Yes!" I said, aching for his cock.</p> <p>Slowly, he slid himself out of me, allowing me to catch my breath again. He leaned back in, looking at my face as he slid himself back in. I looked at him through glazed eyes as we continued to do that until I had just started to relax enough to reach down to take him in. He had now reached forward and was using the underside of his head to rub my clit with, each time entering me just a bit more. He had also now lowered himself on his elbows, with his head next to my face, one hand on my stomach as the other rested on my leg, sliding up and down my lower abdomen.</p> <p>"You like that, don't you?" he asked me as he slid himself back a bit more, giving me a chance to continue to move my body around, and to rub my clit.</p> <p>"Yes!" I answered him.</p> <p>With that, he began to fuck me again, each time taking his hand away from my body to massage a breast. They are both very sensitive to all this stimulation, and I could feel a slight tightening in between my legs. As I watched his hand moving the rest of the way up my stomach, his fingers gently tracing across my clit, I reached down to begin working myself.</p> <p>"Yeah, go for it!" He said to me. "Feel good in there!" With that, he began to do what ever I wanted, slowly moving his pelvis back and forth, not hitting my clit that is, but just lightly rubbing it between my legs. My hips bucked a bit as each time he would push himself fully in me, he would stop when he was all the way out. It felt so sexy and it felt so good too.</p> <p>"Fuck," I said to him.</p> <p>"Oh yeah!" he responded. "I like this soooooooo much!"</p> <p>That was enough for me to reach down and play with my clit, bringing myself to orgasm in less than a minute, and leaving me wanting more. I had always liked the feeling of feeling him inside me, his cock rubbing against that spot inside me that was making me moan. He stopped again, and continued with the thrusting, the teasing and the pressure on my clit each time he pulled back.</p> <p>"Let's do 'me' again," he said asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
