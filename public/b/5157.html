"Well, that's what I like."</p> <p>With that statement, he moved up to her so that they were almost face to face. He wrapped his arms around her and she melted into his arms until he felt her hand touching the bulge in his pants.</p> <p>"My husband doesn't know you are awake and is staring and you don't even know he can see your face."</p> <p>"It would be a good thing he is still fast asleep if he was to see us like this," she said. "I'm sure he has been dreaming all night and would never want to disturb his sleep."</p> <p>"Well, he's probably feeling good right now but he's probably not going to remember any of what happened," Michael assured her. "But it didn't seem to bother you all that much, did it?"</p> <p>"He'll never know about it by any chance," she said and they kissed and soon his tongue was exploring the insides of her mouth.</p> <p>Michael continued exploring her body and when his hands reached her breasts, they started rubbing her as he rubbed her nipples. Soon they were erect and Michael had her naked on the bed. This time, he was the aggressor as his fingers explored every inch of her body. Soon her legs were around his waist and he was fully in her. His cock was rubbing her wetness all over and he was pushing and pulling with his hips and when he felt her legs tighten against his body, he knew she wanted his come in her pussy. Michael knew by the way that she was groaning under his kiss that she was ready to cum.</p> <p>Michael was going to make sure that when she felt him cum inside of her that she would feel even more pleasure. He knew he could do it anytime he wanted but now was the perfect time to decide it. Reaching for her face, Michael pulled her mouth back to his with his tongue. He pulled her mouth back down to his and they kissed again. Their lips never broke contact till she was laying naked on the bed, her mouth still tasting herself. "You are the most incredible woman I have ever met," he said. "Just the thought of another man's come on you makes me weak in the knees."</p> <p>"I feel the same way," she replied with a smile and that sent waves of desire through Michael's body. Her arms were around him and her legs wrapped around his body. She looked up at him with a smile and kissed him. Michael's hands were on her breasts and one hand was exploring her body as the other moved between her legs. Soon they had the passion and urgency building from the way she was arching her body to meet his fingers.</p> <p>Breaking their kiss and she looked at him, "I love when I feel like this with you," she said. "What else could you possibly do to me that makes me feel like this?"</p> <p>He had her on this one and he didn't even know it at this point. Her legs were squeezing his cock and it had been enough to make him shoot a huge load. She had another one on him and she moved against him, wanting his next move.</p> <p>"Maybe tonight, if you don't mind," she said. "You have to be the first to join me in our house."</p> <p>"That's fine with me," he said in a voice that sounded as if he was talking to himself.</p> <p>"Well in that case, I'll be there as soon as we can get her started," she said. "We can arrange things later."</p> <p>"I'll be there as soon as we can get her ready," he replied.</p> <p>They kissed again and he could feel her hand sliding down his stomach to the tip of his dick. "I like this new you when you come in here," she said with a smile and Michael just nodded in agreement.</p> <p>He turned her onto her back and then slid his dick between her legs and up inside of her in one movement. The first time he had made love to her it had been in her first time but she was ready for this. Tonight they were going to have their time and make the most of it. Michael was on fire and he didn't even know it. He was taking his time letting her get used to his penis and in no time at all, they were moving themselves to a climax. Michael pushed his hips hard into hers and felt her body take the same pleasure as he felt her.</p> <p>After his first lovemaking session with her in the shower, he was sure he wouldn't be able to satisfy her after. This time, they had a night of passion and he wanted to make that first time memorableâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
