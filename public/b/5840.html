He began to kiss her forehead, then her eyelids, as she began to drift towards unconsciousness. Her body tensed and shuddered as he continued his caress of her body.</p> <p>"It's now or never, honey", he told her, as he kissed her cheek again.</p> <p>"How can I refuse, so easily", she whispered as she turned her head to him.</p> <p>The kiss continued as he ran his hands along her smooth skin. He ran them over her breasts, her ribcage, her shoulder blades, her stomach and her thighs. She sighed in contentment and anticipation as his fingertips slid along her thighs. Her body tensed in pleasure as his fingertips caressed her exposed skin. Her body trembled with pleasure as she opened her legs. She let out a soft breath as his hands continued their seduction of her thighs.</p> <p>His middle finger slid along her soft flesh, up her inner thighs, then parted them gently as he lowered his head to kiss the inside of her left thigh. He kissed her tender flesh, then her inner thighs and then parted them slightly. She shivered as his tongue pressed against her. He sucked on her swollen lips with his tongue, causing her to moan softly. He then licked the entire surface of her pussy with his tongue. She gasped softly as her legs quivered as he worked it into her.</p> <p>He slipped his tongue between her lips, along the crevice of her inner thigh, around her pussy and then over her pussyhole, causing her to groan softly. He sucked her pussylips into his mouth and began to work his tongue slowly into her pussy. As he sucked her lips into his mouth and gently bit on them, she shuddered in pleasure and she reached for his head. She wrapped herself around him as he worked his tongue into her pussy, causing her to moan in surprise and delight. He lifted his head a little; gazing at her body as he slowly worked his tongue into her. He moved his head back and she reached for his head. She caressed the hair on his head, then ran her hand down his neck and she pulled gently at it with one hand, pulling the hair away from his ear. He smiled knowingly and continued working his tongue slowly into her pussy. She moaned and arched her back as he sucked her clit into his mouth. She arched her back and she reached down and pushed his head into her pussy as she cried out in delight.</p> <p>"Oh God, yes", she whimpered as her body shivered in bliss. She held his head between her thighs as she felt his tongue working its way up her pussy.</p> <p>"Oh God yes", she gasped as she wrapped her hands around his head and pulled his mouth down tight to her.</p> <p>Her body began to shudder and quake as his tongue played her pussy well, stroking and teasing her clit from inside its sheath. She reached into his hair pulling his head tighter and whimpering gently every time his tongue danced lightly over her.</p> <p>Her entire body bucked as her orgasm neared. She gripped the sheets as his tongue teased her hard little love button. Her breathing quickened and her moans grew faster and louder as he worked his tongue in and out of her pussy. He could hear her gasping as her body shook as she approached her release. He felt her body quivering, her legs quivering as he teased her and licked her pussy as only men could.</p> <p>She screamed loudly as her release exploded between her legs, feeling it fill her body as he sucked her clit into his mouth.</p> <p>"Oh God", she groaned as she held his head in place with her hands as she trembled for several moments.</p> <p>Finally, she collapsed back against the pillows. He softly kissed her thighs, stomach and breasts before lifting his head up. He smiled and kissed her lips as he slipped his finger into her pussy once more. She groaned as he slipped his finger into her and began to move it in and out, back and forth. She pushed her hips upwards and writhed as the feelings ran through her body once again. He slid his finger back out of her and then slipped it into his mouth, sucking her juices off of it. Then he leaned over and kissed her gently on the lips and she pulled him closer, whispering:</p> <p>"It took us soâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
