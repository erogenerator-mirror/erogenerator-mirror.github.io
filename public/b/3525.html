Katie coos; her head bowed and her eyes still glowing with joy.</p> <p>"Thank you, dear," Katie coos again; lifting my head until the kiss can take no more.</p> <p>She pushes herself up from the couch, turning around to kiss me, then standing on the couch again, spreading her legs. My eyes trail along her long, smooth legs, over her small, white panties, all the way up to her panties which she slowly pull down her legs. "You want to be inside me?" she asks.</p> <p>My mouth waters and my pussy grows wetter as my head swims between those luscious lips of hers. She leans forward and kisses me again, as she grabs my face in her hands and presses her breasts against me.</p> <p>"I've wanted this for so long!" she coos. "I'm going to enjoy making you crazy!"</p> <p>Our lips brush again, and again. She opens her legs, pulling slightly forward, I can feel her dampness as her panties slip from her body as she pulls them down her legs. My mouth drops, and I can smell her musky scent as it settles across my nose. God, she smells sweet.</p> <p>I run my hands along her legs, my hand finding her wet opening, her hands pushing up against my breasts as she moans softly for me. My body wants to be inside her, filling her, fucking her, but as she's leaning over me, I don't want to hurry and be late. My legs tremble slightly, and in my excitement, I want my own orgasm to be there. As much as I don't want to go back now, it takes me a moment to remember how much I've wanted this, and how good it was. As I pull my hands away, I slip my fingers into the waistband of her panties.</p> <p>"No," she cries out, pulling away and spinning around, her naked body shaking as she starts to fumble with my blouse. "No. Not there!" She yells out, turning her back to me and yanking down the top button, revealing her perky breasts. "Oh god, I need your mouth," she moans, and then pulls my face into her breasts, holding me there, running my nails along them. Her nipples are hardening between my nails, and I pull them down towards my breasts.</p> <p>She stands up, letting my blouse fall back onto the couch, and she takes my hands in hers and starts to lead me towards my bedroom. We're both flushed, both nervous, and her breasts and pussy are exposed to my gaze. Her hands run down my body, over my breasts, over my stomach, over my mound, down my thigh and then back up between my legs. Her fingers circle the outer lips, pressing against my hot box and pushing me ever closer to orgasm.</p> <p>"Let's go get undressed," she says in a teasing voice, her other hand teasing the sensitive flesh of my nipples. I stare at her as she takes my hands and holds them. She turns and heads towards the bedroom. When she walks over to where I am laying, her hand stops at my crotch. Her fingers stroke the wetness there, slowly working it into my hole. "Yes!" she hisses, before pressing her hot, wet finger against my lips. My hips lift slightly, and then she pushes it inside, the wetness of my mouth, our mouths smothering and sheathing each other's touch.</p> <p>When, seconds later, she pulls away, I lay my hands on her shoulders, and she pushes me back down on the couch, her body on mine. She kneels over me, pulling my panties off, over her panties, exposing her sex to my hungry gaze. She kneels over me, lowering herself onto me, pushing her lips against me, as she puts one foot on the couch beside to my foot. She lifts it, pressing it against my stomach, so my knees are on either side of me, lifting up my legs as my body lies on the couch, my legs spreading wide. Her hot, wet opening slowly touches the lips of my pussy, my knees on either side of her thighs.</p> <p>"I want to feel your tongue on me," she says, her mouth and tongue on my clitoris. I put my hands on the back of her head and her lips continue to touch me so close to orgasm, and then back down to my pussy, licking my swollen lips with her tongue like it was her finger. This brings us both on the edge, and with two fingers inside her, I send my orgasm rushing over me, lifting her over it. She pushes down even harder, her mouth on me, her tongue on my clitoris as it explodes, and she kisses me deeply, her tongue exploring my mouth, my lips, my tongue as we share our passionâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
