She was a pretty shy girl—not only was she shy, she couldn't stop smiling at the idea of meeting people and finding their stories. It was her parents that did it, though. Their parents were the only ones that she was seeing that talked about things like this, and yet there they were—as much fun to chat with as the three of them were! It felt really good to chat with them, knowing that there was someone who cared and who would listen to her and that they could have a good friend there. And then there was Rob, that much was obvious in a man. It was Rob that intrigued her, in that he'd only kissed her, given her a handjob or two, and all the other male experiences she'd shared with one of her dates. He was also one of the sexiest guys she'd ever met, just the way she liked him, kind of a nerd. And his friends thought he was cute. And the thought of him made her smile more.</p> <p>Sara went to her room and unpacked her things. She looked at her bed, at the bed that she had seen her boyfriend's father do a lot of times but the bed that she wanted had done a bit of wilder things that made her feel even more horny. That it made her feel good, really good. She'd been doing that for a while now—even though she wasn't really sure why that made any sense—she felt good. She looked down, there her clothes were still hanging off her, her face and neck was a little flushed. She picked up her shoes, she hadn't even seen them before. She slid off the bed and opened the closet to get the rest of her clothes. She ran to her room and opened the door. It was empty except for her underwear. She grabbed her bra and put her panties on. The bra looked so good on her. She put on her panties, they gave just enough coverage to keep her pussy covered. The panties that did help. She had the sexiest, tightest pair of panties she'd ever bought, white, with a white thong underneath. The thought of how tight the panties were made her think of a girl's pussy and pussy made her juices run down her thighs and drizzle onto the bed under the covers.</p> <p>Sara got up and went to her dresser drawer. She pulled out several pair of tan pantyhose and put them on. She liked tan nylon so that they smelled good after she'd had sex. She'd like to give Rob a tan pantyhose—and some sexy, high-heeled sandals with five inch heels. She loved to get fucked through sandals by him, at least in the back, while she was still wearing high heels. Sara had her own collection of pretty sexy pantyhose, too. She also got three other pairs that would do. The sandals with five inch heels would make her wiggle and squirm and feel sexy, so that everyone knew she belonged to a sex club. She put the pantyhose on a little higher. They felt so good on her. "I can wear these with me to the bar," she thought to herself, "and I'll come back for new ones, too."</p> <p>The closet was in the same way as the dresser was. She opened it and found a couple of pairs of black nylon hosiery, they were even better than she'd imagined. She got out her hair iron and makeup kit. Then she tried on the new pantyhose, the pantyhose felt so good in her hands as she pulled on the nylons and then the pantyhose, feeling the nylon against her legs and the pantyhose on her ass. The hose felt so good on her, it made her look even sexier than she always thought. It was her first time wearing them, she thought to herself as she felt them. The feeling of them in her hands, the nylon and also the nylons added a whole new layer of excitement and sexiness to her legs and pussy.</p> <p>Sara went to the mirror to put on the clothes. She had a quick little look on her, her hair had just gone a bit grey—it was still fairly thick. There were so many things about her—she hated to wear a blouse—that she could never wear a bra with them. She took off her panties and put them on. She put her shirt on. It felt good on her ass and legs. Her skirt was shorter, but not as short as before, instead being shorter just enough that she couldn't go too far without bending over. She looked at herself in the mirror, looking in a mirror. She was pretty beautiful, that much it seemed. The only thing that made her look anything was the shoes. She liked how they felt on her, but also—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
