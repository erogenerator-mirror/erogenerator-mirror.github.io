He had his hands wrapped around them and he was thrusting in and out so quick and deep that she thought it would break her and her ass came off the seat.</p> <p>There was no need, because he was going to cum soon. He had to. It had been so long since a man had fucked him like this that his body was ready to go to oblivion. He was not in a state to feel any emotion. He just wanted to get deeper and faster.</p> <p>Tiffany had her hands on the edge of the seat back, and she was pushing back against his body as well. He was humping as fast as he could. She was crying out so loud that she almost dropped the seat. He had his hands tightly around her and he was making short little thrusts. And then he was. His cock was so thick and heavy that he was pumping it in and out over and over again. He was cumming inside her as fast as he could get it in. All three of them were cumming so hard that they were both shaking. His cock was deep inside her and their bodies were a tight mass of flesh. His mouth was on her neck, kissing her hair and then down to her chest. He sucked at one of her nipples while his cock was deep inside her again.</p> <p>They were both laughing hysterically about it all as their bodies went limp, until the reality of the moment sunk in and they all collapsed against the back of the seat. The room was spinning out of control. No longer in a state of shock, just completely exhausted. They had been with each other for over a month, had sex on a regular basis, been intimate and had been intimate again. They were in love. And now, here they were, lying in each other arms, with her legs tucked around him as he was still holding her from behind.</p> <p>They were still laughing and sniveling after their climax.</p> <p>"Oh my God," was all that could come to Tiffany's lips, she finally managed to moan.</p> <p>"I love this!" She said, leaning back and reaching over for his cock still buried in her. "It was so good!"</p> <p>He was still semi hard and he slipped out of her quickly.</p> <p>"Shit! Oh my God," Tiffany said. "I thought we were going to kill each other."</p> <p>"We did," Steve and Jeff said, they looked down at each other.</p> <p>"I could feel his cum inside me. It felt incredible"</p> <p>He looked over at Trevor. Trevor had his mouth open and obviously was still cumming and not saying a word. He glanced over at the door of the room and noticed that there was no other people in, and it looked like they had been fucking each other for over an hour now.</p> <p>"I feel like I'm in heaven."</p> <p>"You are. You fuck your brother and your best friend together in front of each other." Trevor said, leaning back and smiling. "You're the best thing that ever happened to me."</p> <p>"Yeah right" Steve laughed. "Trevor knows what that means."</p> <p>"He knows what it means," Jeff laughed.</p> <p>"He knows all of this," Tiffany said.</p> <p>"He just has no idea that I actually heard him say that," Steve said.</p> <p>"I love the power of that," Jeff said.</p> <p>Tiffany got up and went over to Steve, "Come on up here."</p> <p>She wrapped her arms around his neck and whispered in his ear.</p> <p>"And I do mean all of this," she grinned.</p> <p>"He is as much a part of our relationship as you are," Jeff said.</p> <p>With that they all got out of the car and made the twenty minute walk to the hotel room for the night.</p> <p>Jeff and Trevor were still naked, still on the bed after the sex.</p> <p>"He was a little worried when you told him that we were bringing a girl with us," Trevor said after Tiffany left Steve with Jeff.</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yeah. We thought we would come over and see what you had been doing."</p> <p>"Do you really think I was giving you a blow job?"</p> <p>"No. I know a girl who works there that has been fucking my mother more than once a week."</p> <p>"Oh...oh...sorry," Steve said, not knowing how to respond to the thought of being sexually fucked by him or Jeff.</p> <p>Tiffany kissed him and then slid down his body until she got her face just above Jeff's and slowly let her body slide down his until she was resting her cheek on his thigh. Steve leaned forward and kissed her softly on the lips. It was a long wet kiss, with him kissing her likeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
