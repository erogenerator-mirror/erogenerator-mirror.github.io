She reached down and pulled my shirt off and dropped it on the floor. I lifted her face with both hands and kissed her once more, this time more fervently and more lustfully. Her lips parted, her tongue slid out and caressed my lips as our tongues slid easily and gently together. It was beautiful and it seemed that we were both enjoying it.</p> <p>Our movements became more urgent as the urgency of our kissing built to a fevered pitch. Our moans sounded almost frantic as her arms and fists grasped at my chest while I clutched her face and licked at her lips. I felt her hand grasp my cock and the wet heat of her mouth as she slid her mouth down my shaft.</p> <p>She began to stroke me slowly as if milking me. It was as though she was trying to milk my cock to its full hardness. The sensation was wonderful as she stroked me and licked my cock head. The feeling was exquisite. My cock was rigid before me as she worked the head with her mouth, the throbbing heat of my penis bringing about a similar feeling. She pulled away from my dick quickly and then again with a devilish grin. She began to roll her tongue along the shaft but, after a few false starts, she slid it back and I saw it glistening with her saliva.</p> <p>"Please," I whispered.</p> <p>She reached over to a nearby table and picked up a strawberry and brought it toward my lips. I opened my mouth and took it between my lips, savoring the flavor of it. The strawberry flavor was wonderful, and I loved the way it made my mouth feel. It was one of my favorite stimulants. I was always glad I had such a taste. I reached for her panties and found the waistband. Her legs were opened and I slid them down her legs, making them disappear into a small pile of silk.</p> <p>Without taking her panties off, I knelt between her legs. The smell of her pussy was intoxicating. Her pubic hair was matted and wet with her moisture. She was breathing hard and her breasts rose and fell with each breath. My kisses were on my way to her breasts. They were not big, but there were large brown areolas and large, pink hard nipples. As I kissed those nipples I felt her hands slip under my hair. My lips moved to her nipples as her hands caressed my cheeks and neck and face. I suckled each nipple in turn for a minute or two, then she guided me back down to her breasts. Her pussy was glistening now.</p> <p>I licked her through the panties. It was so silky my mouth was almost raw with desire. My tongue flicked her lips, and my lips closed around her lips. Her body shivered as she shivered with lust. I pulled the panties slowly down her legs. She lifted her legs and the panties fell away. I continued to lick her while her legs parted and her knees bent upward, presenting her sex for my view.</p> <p>I slipped my tongue between her lips and ran it across her clit. She was wet and hot. I pressed my tongue firmly against her opening and licked her. She grabbed my hair in her fist as I thrust my tongue inside her, seeking as much of her pussy as I could. She thrust her hips up trying to get my tongue deeper inside her. When my tongue found her clit she squirmed and shook with her desire. Her voice was a little hoarse as she uttered a hoarse "yes....yes....yes....oh....Oh My God!" As her orgasm took her over the edge I felt her release a flood of fluid around my tongue. I pulled her pussy lips off and sucked her into my mouth. She jerked and trembled as she came in my mouth. It tasted so good.</p> <p>I rose, kissing her as my hands held her from behind. She was hot for more. Her arms embraced me and her legs pressed against my belly. Her legs went around me as I kissed her. A soft "fuck me!" came from her mouth as her face was pressed against my chest and my erection slid against her.</p> <p>"Let's go back to the party where we can be more comfortable," I whispered into her ear.</p> <p>I carried her to the bedroom, and lay her on the bed. "What was that noise?" she asked.</p> <p>I looked at her face and gave her a devilish grin. "Do you always turn that on like that when I give you a fuck?"</p> <p>"Do you know that you could have a fuck anytime you got the urge?"</p> <p>I sat for a minute on her bed and looked her up and down. "When you did that, you made it look so hot, Cindy."
