The site started with three short and quick posts, with a picture of a woman's pussy with the caption, 'Loving wife.' The posts went on for nearly one hour and I was hooked. When the website was complete we were ready. In the third week everything was rolling so quickly that neither of the two guys were in a hurry. A second week passed and I still hadn't found the right time. By then there was still too much work to do since the first few days had passed. By the eighth week I still had not found the right time to talk with the wife as I had in the first two sites.</p> <p>I did try to meet her through email but it really just had to come around the website. I even started emailing a photo every day and it had to be some type of photo. When I knew she really was my wife that weekend I went back and read her pictures over and over again. Every day I emailed her. I did find the one good way to talk to her. That meant she was a little more comfortable with the idea of me seeing her naked. In the end I had to admit I really felt better than I ever had before.</p> <p>I kept my thoughts in my head for the first week before I finally got a chance to talk to her. She asked me if I would be willing to see her at work on a regular basis and if I did meet her at her place. I thought it would help her and in that way it helped me find an easy way to say yes. I even offered to go with her for a couple of days and if any of her friends, including myself, did show up she would probably take them up on the offer. By the time we had been messaging I already knew it would be a good idea for me to go with her. I didn't want to be a big orgy rat because that would hurt her feelings. I liked her a lot and it would be a better idea if she would go with me.</p> <p>The next week was even better because I found out that she might be a little shorter, a little lighter and the second time around the first week there was even less work to do. I talked to her on a few occasions about being on a vacation and how good it was and how much more I would love to be with her. We spent a lot of the time talking about some really good stuff that she had taught me. I had a good idea of what she was like as a teacher and we were getting along very well. The day before my meeting she told me that her husband had left a message on the server and she was expecting to receive a package. I knew that that message was probably from a guy who would be coming back over for a while so I decided to ask her to pick one out. I gave the address and it was a huge house in a really up and moving neighborhood and we were in the city about 50 miles away from work.</p> <p>I told her that she could pick one out and she could get a ride to work and she could come by and pick it up for me if she wanted. She had to get all of her clothes on at the last minute which was a big mistake because I knew it wasn't going to be easy to get. The idea of me getting her clothes would be a huge turn on for her. I really wanted to make her happy and if she did let me I would really do it. She picked out a lovely dress and a pair of heels before she started on me. She started right away talking to me. She seemed excited and I could tell I was getting her a lot better too.</p> <p>When she finished giving me one of her amazing blow jobs I knew she was ready for me to take her out. I knew she wanted that hard cock to take the day that her husband was gone. We set it up in her apartment so I was in the door before I took off her clothes and even before we left for our little adventure. She wore a short red skirt and a silk top with nothing underneath leaving her breasts uncovered to start with. I took off the clothes that she had on and we just went for a ride in my car. She showed me her bedroom just before we got there and she laid out on the bed wearing nothing except a thin pair of red panties. I stripped them off and set them on her bed. I sat on the edge of the bed and asked her if she wanted to play with my cock. She said she had her mind made up so I started.</p> <p>I ran my hands over her thighs as she lay there with her hands playing with my cock. I didn't want her going to any great danger of having a man touch her pussy. It was my choice. I climbed out of bed and started to strip. She just watched me with her hands in herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
