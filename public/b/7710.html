Her hands worked quickly on his chest, massaging and squeezing his muscles. The soft sound of her fingers on his skin sent him over the edge. He grabbed her face and kissed her with deep passion. Her eyes were closed as she fought for control of her own.</p> <p>He pulled back and looked at her. Her eyes fluttered and rolled as she looked at him. "I can go any other way," he said. A devilish grin crossed his lips and he lifted her up and put her on the bed. As she lay on her back, he pushed himself on top of her, her thighs spread around his waist. The look she gave him as he took her hand held her gaze as if he was about to kiss the spot where her fingers joined his. He rubbed his face there and felt his cock growing against the back of her hand.</p> <p>His eyes locked with hers, a hunger there that she could feel. He lowered his hard cock between the cheeks of her ass and she reached over and grabbed the lotion. Her fingers slid through the gooey lather on his cock and she worked it down onto the swollen head until it was glistening with the slick lube. Gently he pushed her back onto the sheets and climbed on top of her. They kissed as he spread her legs and pushed his cock against her clit. He felt the tremble of her body as she took his cock into her pussy. He took her ankles in his hands as he pushed up into her. Her eyes watched his every move as he entered her pussy. She pulled him into her as he slowly withdrew his cock.</p> <p>He slammed home into her. His hands wrapped around her thighs, holding herself up as she began to moan. Her hips rose against him as her body rocked against him. "Fuck!" she gasped into his ear as his cock thrust into her again and again. Each of her movements made his cock pulse again and again. They both had the energy to hold on as long as they could before they succumbed to exhaustion and fell asleep to the sound of the birds lulling them out of their sleep.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>He wasn't aware that she was awake as he lifted her gently off the bed. They both had a long day ahead of them that he couldn't keep up with. He pulled her to him as he rolled off the bed. She wrapped her arms around him as their naked bodies pressed together in the darkness. "I've missed you," he whispered against her ear. Her smile faded slightly and he could tell she was surprised by the words. He kissed her cheek and ran his hands down her neck, across her hard nipples and across her breasts. His lips sought hers once again and kissed her gently, then more firmly. She broke away as he took her nipple into his mouth and nibbled, and bit, as she ground her hips against his. "Oh," she moaned as his fingers squeezed her breast.</p> <p>Her hips began to move against him as he continued her kiss. Their passion grew as their breathing quickened. His hands went to her breasts to toy with her nipples as they kissed. His cock was hard again, trapped between them. He rolled onto his side and pushed her legs apart, and began to kiss up her legs. A few of them came to a grinding start as they neared their objective. Her legs opened wider and his tongue flicked over her swollen clit. She groaned and thrust her hips at him as he lapped at her, drawing out the pleasure. His fingers found her swollen clit and rubbed it and his tongue was soon hitting every spot it could reach. The feelings were overwhelming. Her hands clutched his head as his mouth worked her body over.</p> <p>Her hips were on fire as he worked on her. Her legs were flailing about as his tongue worked more forcefully on her. "Oh, I'm gonna cum!" she cried out.</p> <p>A few seconds later, she felt his cock pulsated and felt him pulse in her tight pussy. They moaned together as he thrust against her. His cock slid in and out as they both climaxed together. Her juices flooded his cock as he slid in her, one orgasm following another. Wave after wave pulsed through their bodies. His cock jerked and spurted thick sticky ropes of cum deep into her pussy with each stroke. They were both spent.</p> <p>They lay together in the darkness. One arm caressing his side as the other lazily stroked her thigh. Her breathing was back to normal, but the feel of his body against hers was still as powerful. Eventually, they heard the door open and close. The house was quiet, except for the two of them. A soft smile crossed his face as he got up and began to follow her. Her eyes met his and he felt a smile grow across his face. They kissed again in the dark.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>Theyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
