Is he gonna tell on you?" She looked around the room. "I'm here with her, remember? She has to be my bestie when she isn't trying to steal away her little friend."</p> <p>As she spoke, Dannielle slid her hands under the table, and pulled his head down so that his lips could press against hers. She gave out a soft shriek as his mouth closed over hers, his tongue pushing into her mouth as his hands began to roam over her body. When his hand slipped under her gown, she couldn't hold back any longer.</p> <p>"M-m-my t-t-t—" she moaned out, and dropped her head back against the surface of the table. She grabbed the back of her sister and pulled her up on the table, sliding her hands around to her hips. She leaned back and rested on her stomach, her tits jiggling as her sister slid her gown up off of her. She could feel the heat of his fingers against her, felt him press his lips against hers, and as he wrapped them around her fingers, she couldn't speak at all, even though she knew he had already claimed her mouth.</p> <p>"Fuck," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.</p> <p>"What's wrong, dannielle?" her voice was filled with concern for the other girl, but was filled with disappointment as well, for that it was never to be explained. It was not until her body relaxed, then, that Dannielle was able to answer.</p> <p>"I-I want to... fuck," her voice came out a sigh, as if her heart was pounding as if it were broken. She didn't know what to say. She didn't want anything to say. This was wrong, she was a girl that had been with other guys before, and was already hoping to have sex. She could do whatever she wanted, but in doing so, she was willing to do anything, right or wrong. She could say yes or no, or do anything she might, just say, even if everything she said wasn't meant for anything specific, just for fun.</p> <p>"Oh?" her voice asked, and she could already feel a tremor.</p> <p>"You know the rules of the game aren't we?" she asked, once again letting her own voice fill with a hint of regret.</p> <p>"Yeah, you know."</p> <p>"I know, but there isn't time," she said. "I have to run... now." They watched as she stepped out of the room and took her sister down the hallway, never looking back.</p> <p>********************</p> <p>The rest of the day was uneventful. Dannielle didn't have much to do, since they hadn't talked for more than two hours, and that was not a big distraction. They would play the game a lot, until the end, and then they would both work through dinner with her sister in a different room. She got off about a half hour before they began, and when they got downstairs, they sat in the kitchen again, and had a quiet dinner before they got it done.</p> <p>"How long is he in town?"</p> <p>"Maybe three or four hours," said Leif.</p> <p>"What's wrong with him then?" her voice was filled with concern for her sister and her friend.</p> <p>"Well, he and the girls are all doing an excursion today, so he'll be staying overnight. I'm the only one that is going as well," Leif said. "He's with the girls now."</p> <p>Leif and Dannielle shook their heads again, and Leif smiled at the thought of how this could possibly solve something. He leaned back in his seat, his eyes closing with happiness. Dannielle came up behind him as he reached for the table, and sat down next to him.</p> <p>"What is he up to this time?" she asked.</p> <p>"Don't know, yet, but soon," he said, his green eyes darkening as he searched hers for answers.</p> <p>"I have two sisters. I know they're different, but I think they might just figure out what they're really up too."</p> <p>"That's nice, Dannielle." He felt his eyes going a little red as he thought about the last time he saw both of them in their bathing suits.</p> <p>"Yes, that's fine, Leif, but right now, when it comes to what you're going to do for the afternoon, just enjoy the moment. Don't want to do anything to change what I'm going to tell them." He leaned back in his seat, waiting as his sisters finished their food before heading upstairs to their rooms.
