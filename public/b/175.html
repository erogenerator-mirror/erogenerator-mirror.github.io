Please, let me fuck you." She spoke as she slowly pulled her dress up. "Please fuck me."</p> <p>"Your wish is my command, little one." His eyes traveled down her body, not taking his eyes from her large breasts as they hung from her chest. He reached out and cupped them, enjoying the softness of them, the shape of her nipples, and the feel of each one in his fingers. He leaned forward, licking her nipples, kissing their sides, and even licking them through the fabric of the dress he had on. "Are you mine, little one?"</p> <p>"You're my Master, sir, please fuck me." A tear trickled down her cheek and he felt it as if from the heat of her body to the softness of his. He didn't have to be asked to answer, her name would mean that much to her, and he knew it. He was his own woman, and she was his woman, and he was her fucker, and he wanted her, and she wanted him, and now. Oh God, she was his.</p> <p>"Fuck her, sir," she repeated. "Fuck my ass. Please, fuck my ass while you're fucking my ass, sir." Her words had the desired effect on him as he leaned forward, kissing her passionately as she pushed back against him. His erection had grown larger and he wanted to take her, fuck her, right here, between them. He took control, he wanted to take her, fuck her, own her, fuck her.</p> <p>He rolled over on top of her, pushing her legs up as he entered her and began fucking her. His hands cupped one of her big breasts, pulling on her nipples, the fabric of her dress fluttering against the heat emitting from within. He drove into her, wanting more of this woman, wanting to push her against him, to feel if he was as big as he remembered, wanted him to fuck her more, want to own her, like this time wasn't so fucking far away now. Her arms circled her head as his own breasts bounced and rubbed against her back, and he felt her pussy tighten around him, her legs tightening around him as she reached back to grind against his hip as he fucked her.</p> <p>"I want to own you," he groaned, and leaned forward, bending his head down, so he could kiss the tip of one of her nipples. He bit it lightly and pulled at it before biting down again. "Please, may I touch you, sir?" Her fingers wrapped around his neck and held him close as she rubbed her clit against him. He bit harder, wanting to hurt her and make her cry out, wanting to punish her as he used her to satisfy his own desire, his own desires.</p> <p>"Yes, sir. Use me. Hurt me," she gasped out as his hardness hit something in her and her body took over, and she began to climax. "I need your cock in me, sir. I need you to cum in me, please." She began pumping her hips against him, rubbing herself against his, feeling both of them explode in each other as they came, and he held her as he let go into her, feeling the warmth and passion of his orgasm on him.</p> <p>"I...I can't take anymore, sir. I'm yours, please?" She looked down to see his cock still inside of her as it fell out and away as she moaned softly. "I need your cock in me, please. Please let me fuck you, sir."</p> <p>He began to pick her up in his arms. "You may stay here. You may go." He said as they kissed briefly before he dropped her back down on the bed. He picked her up and pulled her onto his lap, holding her as she lay back onto the bed before him. He lifted her legs high into the air and began to kiss her thighs, first one then the other, slowly as he got closer and closer to his own release, until he could smell her perfume and her pussy and knew she was his, his. She lay there, her head resting on his chest as he kissed her lips and neck and she wrapped her legs around him, holding him against her.</p> <p>They lay there, their bodies entangled as they both caught their breath. He felt the fire in her body, the heat radiating from her stomach even though he had nothing to do with her. She rested her head against the pillows of his shoulder, her head turned toward him as she sighed and relaxed against his body. She opened her eyes, looking upon his face, her own looking down. She looked into his eyes, wanting to feel something then she had never felt it before, in her life. She closed her eyes once more and felt a tear fall to her cheek as she remembered he had said the exact same thingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
