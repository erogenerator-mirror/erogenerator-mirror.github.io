And when they'd parted they went to the bathroom, making sure they'd both had time to refresh themselves on the water, then returned to the living room. It's what every girl dreamed of seeing.</p> <p>He'd been so happy to make love with their mother and sister when he first joined the family in our country. He was a natural born lover, and it showed the woman in him that he cared for her the way she thought about him. She'd always had to suppress those feelings, thinking that men could get their pleasure from other women's breasts. He made sure she felt as happy to be sexually satisfied as he did, and loved it.</p> <p>She'd been so afraid to be taken up by their own thoughts. She thought women liked women better than men. She was such a freak. How could she live with that? How could her own life continue if she was a freak? She felt like she was an unwanted child and a bad parent.</p> <p>She'd wanted to be more like her.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," he said, "it was wrong. I'm so ashamed."</p> <p>It felt like he was apologizing for having fucked her for years. He couldn't imagine it had ever been that good, and he didn't want to feel guilty about it.</p> <p>"Just tell me where you are and what you're doing. I don't regret it," she said as the light faded. "And you're not guilty. You're a fantastic lover."</p> <p>"I still love you," he replied, "and I'd hoped to marry you, but, I don't need to marry a woman."</p> <p>He could still remember the times he'd masturbated, wondering what he liked about sex. But he'd already told his mother he wasn't married, or if she still liked him. She'd said she was only going to keep seeing him as long as she wanted. He wished she'd stay. He wish she would come home for Christmas, but no, she wouldn't go, even if they had sex.</p> <p>"It's nice of you to tell me when we're happy. It's a lot easier now, when you don't even have to ask me."</p> <p>"Maybe I will tell."</p> <p>He kissed her forehead and kissed her ear.</p> <p>"But remember we'll need to go to a party with other people. Someone like you and I do."</p> <p>She kissed his cheek and he put an arm around her, holding her tightly as he kissed her eyelids.</p> <p>"I'm not sure how good we'll be together when you go to school next year. I think I'm going to start to lose my confidence."</p> <p>"I think we need to work it," he replied.</p> <p>He let her go and she headed to the bathroom to clean herself up then went to stand in front of the mirror. He stood back too, admiring her shape through her blouse. She looked great, and he thought she looked great.</p> <p>"Do you like how it feels to wear sexy things like that?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes," she smiled, "my underwear feels sexy."</p> <p>"Is that the only thing I like?" he asked.</p> <p>He stepped forward, holding out his hands to help her up onto the vanity. When she was on her feet he turned to the mirror and stepped behind her. He put his arms around her and kissed her neck.</p> <p>He ran his hands slowly down her back to her butt cheeks, caressed them, and pulled them apart slightly to expose the wetness between them. He ran one hand up her thigh and then stopped to look at it in the mirror.</p> <p>She was wet and swollen, he could smell her on his hands. He loved that feeling, loved having her touch herself. He rubbed her gently then kissed the back of her neck.</p> <p>As he kissed and caressed her he pulled her skirt up so she could feel even more of the sexy fabric and feel the soft texture against her skin. With two fingers he opened her pussy to his view and to his touch. She trembled, she was so wet so he slipped one finger into her and she gasped.</p> <p>"Do it again," she cried out and he thrust his finger inside her quickly. She trembled more and he leaned forward to kiss her shoulders again.</p> <p>He pulled out his fingers and ran them over her slit again. More of her wetness, she was wet. He had never been able to imagine her having multiple orgasms.</p> <p>His fingers were inside her now, and he had to be careful.</p> <p>"Do it anotherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
