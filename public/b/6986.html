If it doesn't, or we couldn't be in love, it hurts, and doesn't feel right. I can't live like that. I'll just have to find my own way back to that other thing," she said. She felt tears welling up in her eyes.</p> <p>I don't know how to start this. I knew that it would hurt so badly and that I would never make it easy or do any of the things that we both said we were going to do. She didn't know if she could ever let herself trust anyone again. She thought that I didn't trust her enough to have sex with her, when it was clear that I did.</p> <p>Her next words made me want her more than anything. "I love you. I don't care if you think you can keep me or not. I want us to feel like two people again. We can't have sex as often as our lovemaking usually does. I feel like we might never be together. Please don't say that to me again."</p> <p>She looked up at me with her big brown eyes. "I don't want to do anything that I'll do that is too painful. I'll just have to leave with you," she said quietly.</p> <p>"I know that it hurts. I'm not a bad mother. I just, we'll go our separate ways. We don't have to have sex, but it, we should."</p> <p>My mind was racing. This woman, in so many ways had every thing I needed at home, and I wanted to help. "I'm glad to see you being so happy," I told her sincerely. "I can't be with you like I've always wanted to because of what she's trying to do to us both. I don't have the heart to be unfaithful. Don't get me wrong. I'm in a good relationship."</p> <p>"You're not even in love with her?" she asked in surprise.</p> <p>"That kind of thing," I assured her. "I'm happy to see her doing some things that she has never done before."</p> <p>"How do you know how to do that? Even if I'm in love with you and I should feel what you're feeling?"</p> <p>In an attempt at putting her off, I told her that I had no idea how to do this, but when she had asked about doing it with another woman, I finally got the notion out. I had never been unfaithful. All I had done was make love to her. What woman had ever told me that that it wouldn't be something that I had to think about and do or do anything? She was right, it wasn't a problem. I had seen the video. I had gotten that close. I knew that it wouldn't take much to make her happy.</p> <p>She looked up at me with those big, brown eyes and said in a quiet voice. "I don't think I'm in love with you either. I'm in a relationship that should only be with you. I wish I could make everything as fair as we make it. I wish that what we have is all right."</p> <p>"I guess that's true," I agreed. I was starting to get upset, but I also felt as if I had lost ground. "I guess this is goodbye."</p> <p>"Well, we can't just be. I still have the whole weekend to decide what to do. We can do this. I mean a lot of what I've been doing with you and I haven't been with a man since I was an adolescent when I wasn't a little girl. Maybe one day, I'll make it all right by sharing that big, long, lovingly, naked body with you at the same time. I want you to feel me when I'm with you."</p> <p>I had a flashback to this woman in the video that I would always hold with me, feeling my breasts feel her tongue on them in the beginning, and knowing, later, as I walked into the bedroom, I would look down between my legs at her pussy. I could see her lips open, and see the glistening of her fluids when she made love, and feel her in me again. She had turned around, and she was holding her sex open by rubbing her clit around my mouth while I was there. It was a very long memory.</p> <p>"I wish I could have spent enough time with you on my own," she said. "I want you to feel as close to you as me."</p> <p>I don't know how she knew I felt for her. I think that I was just so caught up in the moment that I had forgotten about the whole thing. I couldn't believe that I was suddenly feeling that way. She leaned down and kissed me. "I'll never forget you," I said softly.
