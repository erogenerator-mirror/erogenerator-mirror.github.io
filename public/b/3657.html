So close. So close."</p> <p>"I love you."</p> <p>"I love you. Love is right. Love is wrong."</p> <p>Her lips move and her hips grind into me. Her juices are flowing and she thrusts herself inside me and my balls slap against her. We are both silent for a long time. I could get used to this. She pulls me down on top of her as she reaches down between us and rubs her clit. She groans and groans and my cock slides deep inside her as we both feel waves of pleasure building. My lips hold hers and she moves her tongue into my mouth. She pulls me up and we lock into a kiss as our hips grind faster.</p> <p>Her hands start rubbing her clit faster as two of them slide under her back and pull her toward her own orgasm. Her hips start bucking again and she lets loose a squirt on my cock as her body convulses beneath me. Her eyes roll back into her head as she groans into my mouth as I feel her juices flow as tightly as if she has been riding a horse.</p> <p>"That was incredible," she says in my ear, "I'm almost ready to cum."</p> <p>I nod.

Then see if we don't end before either of us wants it to."</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>I smile. "Yeah, I'm really looking forward to it. But I'm not sure I want to finish in anybody's mouth."</p> <p>"It's okay. It's just that if we were finished by then I'm sure we'd have ended."</p> <p>"Okay. But let's do it again, and maybe even before the weekend. If it's an experience you'll really like, I could definitely recommend you for at least a few times a week."</p> <p>I lay back with a smile on my face and put my hand on her thigh to caress it and her hand is still cupping my cock. She looks up at me and smiles and reaches her hand up to mine to caress me and stroke me. "I've got to ask you something, though."</p> <p>I smile back at her.
