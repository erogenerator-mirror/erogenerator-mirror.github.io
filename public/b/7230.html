But yes, they're beautiful."</p> <p>The group was silent as Kari leaned forward and touched Kat's forehead. For a moment, they sat in silence. Then they got up.</p> <p>"I'm going to start the meal, how was it?"</p> <p>Kari grinned, "So far, it was quite delicious. You're going to have to excuse me."</p> <p>They left the bar and took a stroll around the pool and patio. Kat got nervous as they walked and she stopped to talk to an admiring group. One woman stopped to kiss Kat, as Kris passed by. There was a moment when the kiss was too intense, it was followed by the rest of their dinner.</p> <p>After the waitress left, the others started to watch. Kat was surprised by the lack of interest, the guys had all gone home early for the summer. Kris and Kari were the closest, Kat was in the middle of the group because she'd never been so close to a group of guys before. And yet, she still felt self-conscious.</p> <p>Kat turned back to Kris and, after a quick glance, she leaned in and kissed her.</p> <p>"This is great. Thanks."</p> <p>"No thanks. I had a good time. I'm so happy for you."</p> <p>Kari grinned, "It was great too. I'm so glad I hooked my own boyfriend."</p> <p>Kari paused long enough to let Kris say, "Yeah, it was good."</p> <p>Kari smiled, "You two really are going to be okay."</p> <p>The group moved on and Kat followed. And just like that Kari was gone and Kari was back. The women were all over her, touching and giving her hugs. Kat got her chance to talk with Nikki that night.</p> <p>She was still on a different plane from Kat. But she was closer to Kat, her hand in Kat's. She thought she had done the right thing, but Nikki's arms stayed around her waist. They both knew Kat had a crush on her. But they were surprised when there was no attraction.</p> <p>Their lunch came, and that evening in particular, they sat around discussing the upcoming summer.</p> <p>Kari was relieved for the time that it seemed they could talk to each other. Kat wasn't so much concerned because she was comfortable with her boyfriend. But she was also getting a sense of the importance of being with a woman. She was not attracted to women.</p> <p>In retrospect, maybe it was more of an attraction to Kat than a physical attraction to her, but she had been with men in her life and she was still new. She didn't know, yet, how to handle the situation. Maybe that was how it should be.</p> <p>In any event, Kari got a great deal from it. Kat and Nikki, along with many others had told her about other girls and how they felt about their boyfriends. Kat had made this discovery because she loved to think about herself, and that was one reason for it all.</p> <p>She did not feel obligated to spend the summer like that, but she was still curious about being with a woman. And Kat was becoming more comfortable with her own sexuality.</p> <p>About two hours into the afternoon, the guys went their separate ways. Kari went to talk to Nikki again.</p> <p>"What's going on? You seem tense."</p> <p>Kari shrugged, "What?"</p> <p>"Is there some way that you and Kat can get together? The girls? I mean, I don't know..."</p> <p>Kari was surprised to hear Nikki talking to someone else and she was worried. But she was also pleased that she was doing it for Kat's sake.</p> <p>"It's been a while since we spent time together. We don't really have anything planned. I was thinking a date or two could work, as long as they don't take advantage of us. I mean, why should we be surprised that if she wants to get together, it is ok."</p> <p>Kari nodded, "Okay, that's fine. But maybe we should make an engagement move?"</p> <p>Nikki grinned, "We have a lot to discuss."</p> <p>Kari laughed, "Well, I can't promise anything. If we get busy, maybe things can take a while."</p> <p>Nikki shrugged, "I guess we could wait until we're finished talking."</p> <p>Kari rolled her eyes, "Whatever you say."</p> <p>Kari's heart jumped at the thought of Nikki's commitment about their relationship. And yet she felt confident enough that she could ask for help. The conversation on the way back to the apartment was still going.</p> <p>Kari's heart was running now, so nervous nerves were a part of the conversation. She had the feeling that the next conversation would be about sexâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
