He asked her now.</p> <p>"Can we stop for a moment please? I need to go get my dress and then meet you," she replied meekly as she began helping him dress himself.</p> <p>"It will be hard to believe that you went out to meet a man wearing an almost dress that was nearly as short as your dress." The man smiled at her as they both looked into each others eyes.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm afraid I'll have to help you with your coat and put it on," she told him.</p> <p>She handed him her coat and asked him to hang it on the rack behind the door when he closed it. She took a deep breath and leaned over the door. Her ass pressed into his pelvis. She felt his cock getting harder. She took the coat from her hand. Pulled her arms into the sleeves and tied both hands to the coat hook. She stepped back in the small door. She turned to face him.</p> <p>"Where were we?" she asked looking him in the eye, waiting for what she hoped was an answer.</p> <p>"I should never have agreed to do this. It was too fast, too risky. It shouldn't have happened." She looked him in the eye, "But it did. I was afraid this would be your last evening here. I have to go home with you. I've just missed an extended rendezvous with you," she said as she took his hand to pull up the zip on her dress. She leaned forward and they kissed then she looked him in the eye.</p> <p>"I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me. I'm sorry. I just don't think it is like before. I didn't think it would never happen. But if you have something to say about this, I would like to know," she told him.</p> <p>He stepped away from her holding the coat. He felt the heat between her legs as he looked at her. "I know you're just as beautiful as you are. I'm flattered and a little curious to see what other treasures they carry." He smiled.</p> <p>"I'm sure you'll like them. I think the most important is that you keep mine from being so ugly and lonely that you can't be with me. I'll see you at the dance, but I'm sure you can remember us. And I can see you liking me the way you do." She kissed him. She looked into his eyes.</p> <p>She had almost forgotten where they were. "I think we need to go," she said.</p> <p>"I don't know where to go. There are other places we can go. A club is one of them. I never go there alone." She turned and saw a car just off the other side of the parking lot. "It is okay with me if you want to go with me, but I'm not going with you anywhere unless you want to?" He was serious again. She was worried about not being able to be alone with him.</p> <p>"Are you sure that we don't just want to go dancing. It is all about us and the dance. Is that what you feel about me?"</p> <p>"No. We could go with you. You might go back to your car. Your dress does not make a good sign. We will be safe," she assured him.</p> <p>As they walked into the dark car, she saw he didn't hesitate a second to take off her coat. It was as though she was getting out of her body. As she closed her eyes in pleasure she saw him smile. She felt his arm brush by her thigh. She closed her eyes and she knew she was feeling nothing but the warm softness of his hands. They were so much more than she had hoped for. When he took her arm and led her to the car, she was certain they were going to go home. She felt like she was going to die there at the end of the world. She was so thrilled to have him near her again. The feeling she never wanted was almost overwhelming. She held her breath for only a few seconds. The car was so quiet she nearly lost her balance. Then she heard the door being opened. The darkness just made the feeling all the more intense. The car started and she could see the street lights flashing along the sidewalks.</p> <p>The man who led her to the car quickly closed the door and helped her out and they were on their way. He led her hand in hand and opened doors for her. Once they got inside the car she closed them and the light in the room turned low. She thought he had dimmed the lights as they drove over the large hill and turned down about twenty minutes onto the road. He opened the rear doors and they were finally in the small car. He led her up to a short brick building. They got out of the car and stood in the darknessâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
