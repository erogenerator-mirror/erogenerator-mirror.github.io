I gotta go. It's after midnight. If we're gonna hang out again I have to get back home. But if we do we should definitely come back for more."</p> <p>"OK. Bye." I stood up.</p> <p>"Wait. I forgot for too long I forgot to get me my purse. I guess I'll just take it to the car. Thanks." I gave her a wink and left.</p> <p>She walked up to me and gave me a kiss on the cheek. "I had a wonderful time with you." She gave my ass a little squeeze. "Let me get my car and I'll get the door." She turned back to look at my car.</p> <p>We climbed in my car. I looked at her. She smiled. "Did I do it for you?" She looked so happy.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah. Yes. Of course you did." I got in the car and drove out of town.</p> <p>I drove back to school. I was excited to get back to my girl. But I was so excited that I had to pull over to the curb and wait for my girl. The rest of the day went by so quickly and I couldn't wait to get out of school that I couldn't wait to get home to get my life back back to normal.</p> <p>When I got home the next day I was nervous. I wanted to make sure my girl didn't leave anything to be ashamed of, or jealous. But instead she had gotten herself a kiss. Then she had kissed me. I didn't say anything, but she knew my secret and was enjoying every minute of it that night. As I watched the movie A Princess I had a hard time keeping my hands from roaming over her body, especially her ass. And it was making her wet. But she knew how I was feeling. And she said that she had never done anything like that before. So this made it so much better. She pulled me to her and we had passionate, tongue wrestling. She finally pushed me away, and pushed up her skirt. I looked her in the eye and she smiled. Then she had my belt off my jeans and my cock out from my boxers. She pulled my boxers down too so I could see her pussy for the first time on a clear night. And it looked so hot. I wanted to stick my cock right into her hole. She slid her hand under the elastic on my boxers and took me in her hand. She was stroking me up and down. She slowly rubbed the tip of my cock from the bottom to the tip of my head. Then she licked her hand and slid it under the elastic. I was so hard. She had my cock buried in her mouth and she was sucking me like a professional. This brought me over the top. I came, and she did too.</p> <p>When I recovered from my first orgasm from the evening I took a shower again. I was pretty sure I knew it was just a dream right then. But I felt like I would never forget my first sex encounterâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
