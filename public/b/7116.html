"And good girls are always very happy with their dildos."</p> <p>I gasped out loud and he smiled.</p> <p>"Don't worry. It's not that much of a deal. You'll get what you came here to get, anyway. You have a right to do so," he smiled.</p> <p>"No, I'm not going to do that. Please don't be silly."</p> <p>I knew I sounded like that kind of thing. I'd never felt so excited after being denied for so long.</p> <p>"You were already wet, weren't you? Don't you want some of that?" He asked.</p> <p>"You can't see that! I don't want to be denied." He grinned. "There's no such thing as a fair game for me."</p> <p>"I thought I told you to go to bed."</p> <p>He laughed then. "You did. I've already got you warmed up. When you do it, you better behave for the next two hours. Don't try to fight me; you'll learn how to please me in between."</p> <p>"Okay," I whispered. A part of my body was still tingling, but my brain remained numb to the situation, unable to make the connections. I had no idea how I was supposed to respond.</p> <p>"But you will."</p> <p>"Oh, but it's only three hours. I'm already yours. You can play with yourself until you're ready."</p> <p>I was already dripping before he spoke. I knew I wasn't allowed to play, but I couldn't say no to him.</p> <p>"Don't worry. I'm still your master, and I'll decide when you play."</p> <p>We walked to his office and he had me kneel on one of the office chairs and get on all fours again, just like we'd been doing the night before. When we were in the office again, he pushed me up against the arms of the office chair. His hands were hot on my sides.</p> <p>"Please," I begged.</p> <p>"I don't want to hear this," he growled. He was still clothed, and his erection jutted into my stomach while it poked through his boxer shorts.</p> <p>"Please, Master," I whispered, "please fuck me, do it now."</p> <p>I could tell by the expression on his face that he was very excited about the idea. He had no real intention of raping me. I was sure of it. My pussy had been well lubricated throughout the evening. I didn't care to enjoy that pleasure for another hour or so. I would enjoy it a lot more after I knew what he had in mind for me.</p> <p>He grabbed my hair, yanked it back, and forced his rigid cock into my mouth. I knew my body was his, and there was no doubt in my mind that he should fuck me. His fingers tangled in my hair, he pulled my hair. And then he filled my mouth with his cock again. The head slipped past my lips, and then the shaft sank deeper inside my mouth.</p> <p>There were no words, only moans and grunts. I gagged as he pushed his cock down my throat. It slid all the way in, and I had to stretch my jaws to accommodate him. When I felt like I was going to pass out, he pulled back out. The head of his cock made its way past my lips again and he pulled out again.</p> <p>"Open your mouth," he commanded.</p> <p>I obeyed, gasping out and swallowing before he forced himself back in again. My head was spinning at the thought of cum gushing down my throat, and he fucked my throat hard until I didn't care. He kept himself in motion for another few minutes, until my mouth was overflowing with his warm stuff.</p> <p>"You've been such a good girl tonight, little one," he smiled. "You're going to love it when I come, aren't you?"</p> <p>He had a smirk on his face, as he knew I would.</p> <p>"Not this time," I whispered. "I want you to fuck me, and I want you to use that big cock of yours on me."</p> <p>"I'll let go of you for that. Take your clothes off." He looked surprised. "But first. Get undressed," he ordered. I was already naked.</p> <p>"Get over this side of the desk," he said, as he picked up a few things he had brought with him from his office. "I've got a surprise for you, though. I got to be in town for a few weeks, so I'll need to be here at least until then. That's it, get moving." He put the things he'd brought down on the table and sat downâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
