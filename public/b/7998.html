You had me go get a refill and a glass of wine and we should go see a movie. It has a play by play of the play, right?"</p> <p>"Sure. That would be great."</p> <p>"Great, Ma'am," he said as he turned and grabbed my hand and kissed it. My first ever lover and I felt like we were in love.</p> <p>He led me to his sofa and made us both comfortable so we didn't have any clothes on and had a glass or two of wine. We talked a while and I told him that I didn't want to spoil the surprise for him. I told him that he should not spoil a first time experience and I didn't want to rush things or make it awkward with him as all things would be perfect.</p> <p>He asked me to tell him a bit more about my past and I told him about my life with my new boss. I told him if he was uncomfortable talking about his past, he had to know before we got started. I told him about some of my co-workers and the time I worked at a construction company in town that I had a thing for black guys. I said if I didn't like it, I could never ask for it again. He was a little shocked, but was happy to hear about my sexual escapades with a black guy.</p> <p>I told him that I loved him very much and that things would be fine and that I didn't want anything to happen to us. I told him that he could touch me, rub me, make me feel good or whatever he wanted. I told him that he could do whatever he wanted if it pleased him to go slow with me. He would have to give me time to get used to his big cock inside me. I told him to just take it slow and if I asked him for more, he would take his time. There would be no rush and maybe even be very gentle if you know what I mean.</p> <p>He just couldn't take the suspense any more as he moved in front of me and put his hand down on my waist. He started slowly rubbing my stomach, getting closer and closer to the spot he loved so much. I didn't try to take his hand away because I knew that I would never do it. Instead, I told him to make his way down and I took his hand and moved it to my crotch then up to my tits. I told him to rub me for just a bit then to let him do it again.</p> <p>He just continued to rub me the same way. He was obviously doing something about him now as he felt my pussy becoming wetter and wetter. I could tell that his finger was working on my pussy as I was soaking down there. When he started to touch my clit again, I felt the first stirrings of a hardening in his cock.</p> <p>"Ma'am?"</p> <p>"Honey, I'm so horny that I'm going to blow," I said softly as he could barely touch me.</p> <p>"What?" He said, surprised by my sudden change in tone.</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"You said that you'd let me suck a black cock if I asked you," he said as he started rubbing my clit again. We hadn't moved from the couch and I moved down over the leather that covered it from the outside of it to be able to use it to massage my clit properly.</p> <p>"I want to suck it," I said as I positioned myself over the couch's edge facing towards him. He still wasn't fully erect, but I knew that he would be.</p> <p>"I didn't just say that," he said as he moved in closer to us. "Just let me do to you what you asked, Ma'am" he whispered. His lips were now inches away from my own and I could feel his breath on my face as he reached into my blouse.</p> <p>"Oh, Ma'am," he said as he unbuttoned my blouse. He had the silk undershirt off as soon as it came down and I felt his warm breath on my exposed nipple. This was a new touch for me that I loved. I took his head and pushed him back a bit as I removed my hand and placed his head next to mine. His large hands were still massaging my tits and his hand seemed to move on itself to reach my clit.</p> <p>"Oh, Oh, Oh," I was trying to tell him what to do and when I felt his tongue against my clit, "Please, Oh, Please. Please, Please."</p> <p>"Mmm," he said with his lips on my neck where it joins the rest of my body. I didn't know what to do, but I knew I couldn't help myself. I leaned forward towards him and grabbed his head while his fingers wereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
