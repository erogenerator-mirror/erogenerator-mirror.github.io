I thought you were a girlfriend."</p> <p>"No, you know I'm not a girlfriend," she said in a quiet voice. "I don't feel that way at all."</p> <p>"I'm just curious," he said. He walked over to her and took her by the hand. She didn't resist as he led her to the bed. He sat down and pulled the covers up and over her. She shivered as his warm body next to her.</p> <p>"So, um, I'm gay?" she asked, as she sat up.</p> <p>"Yes, but you are. I'm in the right frame of mind to find out, and maybe we can figure out how we feel about each other."</p> <p>"Are you sure you would like this?" she asked.</p> <p>"I would," he said. He laid back and pulled her down and held her in his arms.</p> <p>***************************************</p> <p>They lay there quietly for a long time. He knew it was a couple hours before they were to go into town. As they fell asleep, he thought of his own questions. Why did she want to be with him? How did she see him? What would it be like to actually have sex with a guy. She was just so beautiful and sexy. It made him so hot and he just kept thinking about her as they lay there in the darkness. He was still thinking about what the night would have been like if he had had the chance. He couldn't help but think of her kissing and touching as she did so many times beforeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
