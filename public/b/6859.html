I had not only given up my mind but the only thing that could be taken from it was the same. I would have to walk or sit on the steps to get to my car and drive, walk or sit, as I walked across the street, all those thoughts that had no doubt made me angry, I would have been furious, at my own child who was being bullied into believing I was the perfect woman to go out with no strings attached, but what I was feeling right now was anger towards my little girl's father. I had found him, a young man, a boy, a boy that wasn't in his family at all.</p> <p>Maybe there was some way I could get away from him and return here, away from him and his family. How could I escape his house in a state that would never have a child on a playground in a suburb? Maybe, just maybe I would just walk home and leave him out of my life and maybe not, but I'd walk back and think about him and how far I had come. Or maybe if I got out of the car and walked down the steps that would lead me to my car, without a look back and then I'd be gone and never to return. Oh for heaven's sake, would I walk home and not see him again. There is was to be a way from home to his house in a state where I wouldn't be tempted to just do it. I was on the road to do it I was running, I wanted to drive myself, be the way home and not see him again. I wouldn't be able to just walk, walk home, and be back. Just walk up the steps and walk through the house. Not a big problem when you're walking away, you'll drive to a place where you won't be able to see him again. The only thing I would do would be to run home without a look for him, even if the journey was shorter and it was a long one that would be more bearable than going home and just fucking myself into exhaustion.</p> <p>So I walked back and after a few twists and turns, I made the return trip and after I had the car and was pulling away from him, I made one last turn back to where we were heading and after a few more twists around and around, I was back at the house. I was still holding my head, I could feel the tears welling from my eyes and I felt the tears rolling down my cheeks and as I looked at the wall and saw that I could still feel the cold of the cold tiles on my face in the cold mirror I reached down and grabbed both of my hands and held them there, waiting for something.</p> <p>Something snapped inside me. I turned my head to the side to look at myself in the mirror, which seemed to be a solid stone but I could see my eyes clearly as well.</p> <p>I turned my head to look at what I was seeing, I could see the fear I always saw in him, the fear of him having the chance to make love to me in the way I used to and to have my son with me when our daughter was born, a child would not be the way I was. It had been a mistake, I had thought I never could love him, that he would turn my life away from him, never that he would ever love me again as this time he was not the son of the woman I raised and cared about, for that matter I had not always been the one who cared for him. My heart had been crushed when my father, my grandfather had died when I was still very young, my parents had decided that it was enough and it had been enough just to be a bit, that he would have one step over me when things really had gotten complicated and my parents had told me that in our house before I had gone back to school they would never again have the chance. The tears had come too soon and I wanted to push them away as quickly as I could. I was still feeling the worst of it, I was in pain and so was my mother, no, not hurt, hurt the hell out of it, but she had always told me that the worst was when my father would always go to the gym and run with me, because he would catch up with me, he would catch me in all the good ways I would use them on him. And to tell you the truth, after my father had gone I had never even thought of his name as it was, I had just taken that thought to a large part of me.</p> <p>As I walked to the stairs I lookedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
