I'm busy. The time to think is now."</p> <p>"You are one of my people. Now, get dressed before you do something that will drive us all away. I won't say a word to anybody, just give them a shot. Don't do anything you don't want to do." He was already pulling up his pants when I entered the room, the look in his eyes changed from curiosity to something a little more predatory, then he disappeared.</p> <p>I hurriedly got dressed, my mind still wandering over the events of the previous night. Had they all gone with my plan or what? It seemed so clear now. He could even blame the two of them for what happened last night.</p> <p>At home, I picked up my cell phone, and waited. The day was nearly upon me. It was only just after 8. I got home and prepared for the day. I had plenty of clean clothes, so I figured I might as well start on them while I was driving.</p> <p>I went into the kitchen to get some water, and grabbed water, and some ice packs to give myself a bit of a break from the daily drudgery. While I was gone, I put ice packs down on my car to hold it down, and started it up. The cold water felt good to me.</p> <p>I got ready, and then hurried back to the bedroom. I hadn't even closed the door when I heard the sound of my clothes being removed. A quick dash of running water went into my car, then it was a few seconds later that I heard the sound of feet running down the stairs.</p> <p>The sound of those feet came from the bottom of the stairs, coming in the open doorway. I jumped down the stairs and quickly ran to meet a few seconds later, with the ice packs and other things piled up. The second she came, I threw her on the floor and rolled her to her side. I grabbed her by the hand, and rolled her onto her back, straddling her waist as the ice was pulled off.</p> <p>I knelt down and grabbed at her ankles, holding them apart for her to take off the rest of her clothing. I threw them onto the bed, and she was soon naked. The sight of her naked body made my cock start to throb, and her arms were now useless without me holding them open. When I started back up again I saw her expression change, as was her reaction to what she saw, and she was now smiling at what she had seen.</p> <p>She looked a little different from that morning, the look of surprise was back, a little less playful, but still a little less playful. Something about that expression seemed to confirm something that I had to confirm.</p> <p>"What's the meaning of that? I can't... I mean, I've done nothing but..." I stammered out.</p> <p>"I asked you a question, or I'm going to kill you," she said with a smile on her face.</p> <p>"That's ok," I replied, my voice suddenly quiet again, just a little quieter. "What the fuck are you doing?"</p> <p>"Watching, what you did to me. You were so nice, and I'm just so fucking horny... I've wanted to do this for a long time. I didn't know you weren't just going to give me what I asked for."</p> <p>"Fuck off. You wanted every second you got."</p> <p>"I came when you did," she said, her tone serious.</p> <p>"And what makes you think I was just going to give you what you wanted?"</p> <p>"I don't know. I know how you were feeling by now. You were feeling horny, and didn't know how the hell to get down."</p> <p>She got up and walked over to me, taking a hold of my neck, pulling me back against the bed, then pulling my hands up towards her and pulling them away. "No. That's not what I said," she said, pushing me gently away. "You told me to go for it. You said you wanted to do it, and to let me get even with Lisa for wanting to get your ass in here. Now, you're right, I didn't say anything about asking her out, or letting you... I just walked away. So... you had to go through with it, and be honest... when the time was right."</p> <p>"But I didn't expect..."</p> <p>"Why not? I've always wanted to fuck you. I mean... if you want to, I'm your friend."</p> <p>"No, you don't have to... come on! I don't want to fuck anyone. I want you. I wanted to do it with anyone."</p> <p>"No, I mean yes. You can fuck anybody you want."</p> <p>"I don't know.
