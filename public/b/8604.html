He caught my arm, "We already tried to stop them!" I said, looking back to the path out of his arms. My hips lifted toward him, feeling his erection poking up the small of my backside. He slipped his arms around my body and pulled me back against his chest, his body warm and soft against my side. Our mouths met again and I felt his tongue dancing against mine. He pulled back, leaving my neck and mouth tingling, "You're ready?" "Of course," I smiled, turning around, "But I'm not so sure I want to do it in the hot tub."</p> <p>"There's a place I can set you free for dinner in my house." I said, "And if we're not too tired, you can have your clothes in the suitcase by the time you get there tonight."</p> <p>"It doesn't look like you're tired," I grinned, "At least not by yourself."</p> <p>"All right. Let's go." he said, lifting me up and walking with me out of the tub. "But we'll be back tomorrow in the hot tub."</p> <p>"I have a date with her for tonight and I need to get ready for it," I said playfully, "But if you need me here, just let me know."</p> <p>He laughed at my mock seriousness, "You better hurry up, or I'll call the police."</p> <p>"But I don't think I could walk if you were driving." I answered, moving back toward the exit at my car. I had the thought of stopping and telling him about what I'd done the evening before, but then I had a very different feeling in my stomach. We weren't exactly the kind of couple he would want to run their marriage down.</p> <p>"All right," he said with a small smile, pulling me up, "But you have to promise I won't go and see those pictures on that damn magazine that you were reading."</p> <p>"Okay," I replied, "I promise."</p> <p>"I promise," he squeezed my arm, and we hurried out of the tub. We were both nervous, but I wasn't sure what else I had in mind. He was going to be the one to take pictures of me nude. He was the one to touch me. He was the one to kiss me there. And on top of that, he'd probably probably be in the bedroom masturbating to the memory of all the times he'd had to touch himself, and even then it was going to be more than just making out. I wasn't sure I felt sure of anything, but it was too soon to be worried about that.</p> <p>I was standing in front of an old couch in the back of the house, completely naked and looking at my lover, his naked lover, with a smirk on his face. Just like they all were, he was just there with a smile. In retrospect I really didn't think about it as very much, but right now it was making me a little excited. I was going to have one of him in my mouth. He smiled, and I just stood there enjoying his company. I'd had just as much fun kissing him then as I had with his sister and then I'd had something even better just as much fun now. I really had one of the best lovers I had even with anyone, if not for who and what I was. Even more so, we had a beautiful home to ourselves, even if it was the only way I could get him to sleep with me. And tonight was for me to be the one to take pictures of the whole picture of our love making.</p> <p>I looked back over my shoulder and winked at him, walking inside with me. He was standing on the front step of our bedroom door watching me as I walked toward him on the other side. I stopped and smiled at him, turning toward him. I reached forward, slipping my hand around his waist, and pulled him into me. I kissed him and he responded by pushing his hip toward me. I was still bent in half from the waist, letting my breast swing side to side as I moved backward to press our lips together. We'd been there long enough that we were really going to get our lips on each other. It was exciting and I could tell he had also been aroused from watching me and having the opportunity to show off to him. I felt his hand run along my side to my hip as he moved his hips toward me. He pressed it against my bottom, holding me with his arm around my shoulder. I put my other hand, still bent in half, on the small of his back, pulling him toward me.</p> <p>"Take me to bed," I saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
