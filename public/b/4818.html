I responded.</p> <p>She was quiet for a moment then she looked at me with her green-rimmed glasses, "Thank you sir for the wine Mr. O'Brien had." she said. "May I ask you your name please?"</p> <p>"John." I answered.</p> <p>"I would like to try your food when I have finished my meal."</p> <p>"Very well. It will be ready by mid-afternoon and I must take it with me. We have some errands to do and I will see you about six-thirty. We will talk before going to your home Mr. O'Brien."</p> <p>"Yes please. I'll have it on the counter by six." I replied and she left.</p> <p>The conversation went along with my meal to the end of the meal. I sat on a bench outside the diner, watching as she served the meat in various dishes and then I picked up the meat. I was feeling a bit rambunctious when she returned bearing two plates and a glass. "Please sit down Sir." she said and I did. I could tell she was feeling very well at times as she carried the food to the kitchen. "Thank you Sir for all the compliments I've been getting." she said and gave a polite little giggle from across the table.</p> <p>As the meal cooked I sat with my back turned to her at the table. I leaned over and kissed her on the cheek, "Thank you Mary for everything and so much of your meal." I whispered then kissed her forehead.</p> <p>"Thank you sir." She whispered when the conversation ended. She smiled and looked over at me, "I look forward to it Sir."</p> <p>"Well, thank you very much for tonight." I said, then continued to lean over and give her a quick kiss on the lips.</p> <p>She turned her attention back to the plate as I sat across the table. "You were very impressive sir." she said.</p> <p>I smiled and I smiled back, "Thank you very much Mary and you have very much of an excellent imagination." I replied.</p> <p>"So, I see you're not the only one you're going to be spending a lot of time making yourself very happy." she said. "How was your meal Sir?"</p> <p>Without answering, she picked up the food and took a bite of the meat, "Very nice. Thank you very much Mary."</p> <p>"It was good Mary." she said and took another bite. "Would you like another after we finished our meal?"</p> <p>"Thank you sir." she said, then, "Can I put it in my purse?" she asked.</p> <p>"No not yet." I replied, setting my fork down.</p> <p>"Thank you sir." she said and I watched her leave my study just before six to fetch her purse.</p> <p>"May I serve yours sir?" asked Mary as she got to the table, followed almost by me. It was very difficult, with the dishes piled on top, to lift the plate with the meat on it to the fork properly.</p> <p>"Certainly, and you may." I answered.</p> <p>She came back with the bottle of wine and a glass with a couple of ice cubes she brought before reaching up and taking the food off the table, "Thank you Sir. I'll do that." she said and handed the glass to me.</p> <p>I set my napkin on the edge of my glass and raised my glass. I took a sip from it as Mary finished off the meat and then I held her hand. We sat for a moment sipping my wine at a slow conversation then she excused herself and said, "Thank you Mr. O'Brien."</p> <p>I waved and picked up her plate and a plate. "Do you have any other dishes?" I asked.</p> <p>"I think I will go and check them out." she replied.</p> <p>I looked down at the plate again and then nodded then followed her. As we walked to the sink I said, "Could I offer you something to drink?"</p> <p>"No thank you sir?" she replied, obviously a little taken aback by the request, but looking over my shoulder as I took my plate.</p> <p>"I will be in to get your bags Sir. My mother will be with me a little later. We will be back in a bit, if your mother is interested." I added.</p> <p>"Thank you sir." she replied.</p> <p>I handed her the bags then turned my attention to her. "Please, sit down so I can get your things." I told her and she sat down at the table. I waited for what was likely to be several minutes then, "Could you please sit down at your table Sir?" I asked quietly.</p> <p>"I am quite alright Mr.'s Mary for a while." she said.</p> <p>I got to my feetâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
