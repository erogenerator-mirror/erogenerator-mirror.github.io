As she spoke she pulled the back of my T-shirt down enough to expose the small cleft of my bottom.</p> <p>"Hush", she said firmly, "I haven't done anything. I just want to know a few things about you... about what sex is like." I felt her finger teasing my anus. She pushed just a tiny bit and the tip of her fingernail touched right at the edge of my bottom. I felt my cheeks flop apart, allowing her finger easier access. Without warning she brought it closer to my anus.</p> <p>"I don't want you to have anal sex. This would be too weird not to be with you," she said. I felt her fingertip start to enter me, her finger pushing against my anus. It was not what I had anticipated. She felt my anal muscles resist at her intrusion. "There's no way we're going any further with this," she said firmly. It was a little better than the teasing she had experienced with her finger and I knew that it was going to be good as well. Maybe it would even be a turn-on to be finger-fucked in my bottom.</p> <p>It wasn't that she was a repulsive girl. She was simply a girl that had enjoyed a fair share of fun with guys during her life. For me it was just that her and I had never gotten around to having a lot more fun together.</p> <p>I could feel her finger now poking my anal opening a bit. Slowly she pushed two fingers inside me. At first my anus clenched up trying to resist her intrusion and tried to pull them back out - but she held them in. She slowly pushed them in a little at a time. I felt her finger pressing against my sphincter muscle and I wanted to say no, to push her away, to tell her to go away but I was too shocked and embarrassed to do anything. I just lay there with my head in the crook of her arm and her fingers as they slowly worked their way up and down my back, backside and then back in. After another five minutes or so we both became breathless. We each felt a little awkward holding each other's arms and so we just sat there kissing.</p> <p>I felt her lips kissing slowly up to my ear and then to my neck. She started to kiss then lick at a spot on my neck. Her tongue started to lick against my muscle, moving in small circles. Her fingers began to stroke my bottom. Slowly she moved around to the front of me, pressing her fingers against my clitoris, her lips against my lips. I felt her tongue inside me and her fingers working against my clitoris.</p> <p>I suddenly realised that I could actually feel I was getting turned on. My bottom started to thrust up against her finger which felt very good. She could feel the wetness and warmth of my vagina as her fingers slid in and out of me.</p> <p>"You feel so very good," she said. "Do you know that no matter how many guys your age that you turn into a woman, they aren't going to want to do anything with you."</p> <p>"We'll just have to try to keep quiet for a while."</p> <p>"I think we should have a lot more fun with you," she said, pulling her fingers off to push towards my vagina.</p> <p>"Here," she said, "I know exactly what I want to do with you." She held out her hand as she started to open my vagina lips. I felt her fingers pushing my outer lips open like a flower. I felt the lips start to get bigger as she pushed and soon they were as wide as those lips in your mouth were usually. Suddenly it felt very slippery and wet.</p> <p>"Do you think you're ready for anything more?" she asked. She leaned forward and I felt her licking around my mouth.</p> <p>"If you want this I'd love anything," she said, "But don't I have a little adventure now? I'd love to fuck you, so just take a good look at us. I'd do anything for your lovely penis and then I'll come back to finish undressing you."</p> <p>What she said next gave me a whole new angle on sex. She pulled her face back and put her lips against mine and pushed her fingers inside my vagina. She went in and out a little at a time. I could feel my vagina becoming used to it as her hand moved across it.</p> <p>"It's so tight, but I can't describe how good you feel," she said as she gently massaged my clitoris. I could feel my vagina muscles tightening around her fingers and then I could just feel her moving backwards then forwards. I could feel her fingers pushing my vagina lips apart and the pressure increased as she pressed against the inside ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
