She teased.</p> <p>"That depends on how you count?" I admitted.</p> <p>"I'd count every guy she went on and on, but I've never tried anything with you." She smiled.</p> <p>"That's interesting." I told her.</p> <p>"I never realized it, until today." She giggled.</p> <p>We were just about reaching the cab and when we started to get out, I pulled her out of the taxi by that nice ass and pressed her body up against mine. "Where do we go from here?" I asked. I could see that she was enjoying the feeling. I wasn't just doing it to tease her, it had been quite some time since I did that to her. It made for a nice touch.</p> <p>"Where do we go from here or do you want some fun first?" I smiled.</p> <p>"Hang with me," she said. We went out, got in a cab, walked over to the place at the end of the street. We got in the back. She laid face down on the bed, and I went down in the seat and put one arm under her hip, then the other one under her other hip and reached down, pulling her body with me towards me. I was looking up at her beautiful breasts and the rest of her. I reached around her, grabbing one and my cock and brought it up between her legs and began to gently rub it between her pussy lips. She squirmed against me. I felt her heat and I was hard again. She was enjoying this.</p> <p>My left hand roamed over her shoulder, down her chest with my right, and I held my middle finger around her right nipple. I could feel her start to move against it in the seat, but I didn't think I did much about it.</p> <p>Our little game continued and she continued pushing against my finger, now squeezing my cock while I played with her right nipple. She started to moan with each stroke of my finger while I kept sliding it in and out of her. She leaned back, her head back down, and I took a nipple between my lips.</p> <p>"God, I love it when you do that." She said. She grabbed my hair and pulled me down toward her chest. She began to suck on my cock while she did so. My finger slid further in and I could feel her clit as it made its way past her lips and touched her inner thigh as I pushed my middle finger in deeper and my thumb on her nipple. I put her legs over each of my shoulders and slid my cock in and out of her.</p> <p>"God, I love it when you do that," she moaned. She kept sucking on my cock while I had my hand between her thighs and my hand on her clit. In the back of my head, I felt her body start to quiver, and I knew what she wanted and I knew how she liked it so I slid my left hand back under her ass and cupped my other hand on the wall, pressing my chest back toward her, letting them rest there. I slid my right hand around her cheek, pulling her back. I slid my middle finger in deep and pumped it around, making sure I rubbed her clit, pressing her body against mine. She looked like she might go crazy if I didn't keep at least going, but I didn't, I pushed up again and moved my other hand to do the same to her. I stopped myself when I came, and I could feel her body go into spasms as she came.</p> <p>I pulled out and collapsed down on my back next to her. "That was great!" she said.</p> <p>"That was wonderful." I said.</p> <p>"I'd like to do that to a few more guys, but I'm not sure if I could handle that. That was so good." She grinned. "Do you like it?"</p> <p>"Oh yes, I love it." I told her.</p> <p>"You can have my pussy for the rest of the night if you want." Now she smiled and said, "OK, I guess if you do it, I'll let you stay for the next night, but after you get off the next day, we'll see." She looked at me kind of funny.</p> <p>"Oh, I get it," she grinned.</p> <p>"You want me to go again?" I asked.</p> <p>"It's up to you," she said.</p> <p>"I hope so."</p> <p>Well, we were done and we went back into the room. She asked if I would like to make love, or if I wanted her to stay the night. I was kind of shocked that she'd thought this. She wanted to start a new lover and I wanted the sameâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
