Because you're the one with a relationship, no doubt?"</p> <p>"No, not at all," he said, "I love her in the worst way. I didn't want her to think this was a one-time thing."</p> <p>I started to shake. He was right. If I was really attracted to him, I would have done anything to just go back to her; she was in the habit of sucking my cock, and if that didn't fix the issue with my girlfriend, she got me into some trouble as well. It was one of the things I needed to come to terms with in my life, and I felt like this was the only way I could reach that point. "I'll go talk to her."</p> <p>"You must be worried about her, you have to have her just to see," he said softly. I looked at him. He smiled at me before going back to his car and leaving me to my thoughts.</p> <p>When I arrived at work, I made my usual trips out to my apartment and had just about given up hope when I heard my office say something about the next quarter end.</p> <p>"How is the deal going?" I heard my co-worker ask. I opened my eyes and said "You know the deal, buddy."</p> <p>"I'll give you that, and then the team will leave," he said.</p> <p>"It's good to see you all happy again," I responded, "and I think your co-workers are too. How was your day? You seem to have a lot of things on your mind."</p> <p>"Not bad, just a little tired," he responded. "I'm not complaining. Are you really going to go see her then, or do you want to pick up the tab this time?"</p> <p>"No, I'm not going to do that. I feel that we can work around it, at least until we can get to know our new boss. We have everything covered."</p> <p>He made an even face and walked away.</p> <p>"Well, if that's your way, I will see her then, if you don't mind," I said, trying to ignore the fact that all her co-workers were now calling to say how much better the deal looked with my new job.</p> <p>"It's probably not necessary, I'm working very hard," I heard my new boss say. My heart jumped in my chest.</p> <p>Now here is where it all began. After our first meeting, I went back to my desk with all my papers for the next hour.</p> <p>A couple weeks later, I called into the office that morning. I spoke to all the co-workers, and asked them to tell me why they were feeling so frustrated; why there was only one person that was willing to work with them, and they were all right with it.</p> <p>There was the woman; I went back to my desk when I got to my office. She was right as usual; it made no difference to me in the least if the deal was going to stay the way it was.</p> <p>I had my secretary come into my office to start closing the deal on the account, but she was still on. Just to make certain that I had the situation under control, she looked at me. I could tell she was impressed. All her questions, and even asked me a series of questions. I finally said that it was time; I could get back to my desk after closing the deal, and I went back to mine. She was gone on a business trip, so my work was finished by now.</p> <p>That night, my co-worker was still on with the deal. She started her questioning with me again, but this time more carefully.</p> <p>"Well?"</p> <p>It was almost like she was starting to trust me. I wasn't going to just do it. I was going to have to make up my mind. I knew in my heart, that what I had to do was do. I wanted to tell her that I loved her and didn't have a relationship with her, and that I would do everything I could to have a relationship with the woman that made me happy. I needed to make up my mind. My mind screamed for me to just go on and do it, and get on with my life. I needed to tell her that it was alright to go back to the deal, but I couldn't. I just couldn't.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," the girl said, "I was just trying to help." I stopped listening, "I didn't mean it to sound like that."</p> <p>"It's fine if you want to," I said calmly, "but you don't need to worry. I really want to see, and hear fromâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
