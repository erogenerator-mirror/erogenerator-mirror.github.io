His ass was still rising.</p> <p>Sylvia slowly, so very slowly, slid her fingers up the crack of his ass. He jumped, and his hips lifted slightly, almost off of her hand with a grunt, a moan of shock. She smiled and slid her fingers even further, up into his rectum slowly and deeply, then slowly out, then in again, pulling them and pushing back again. He groaned, then began to move his fingers in circular motions on his own clit, with his own motion moving the tip. She moaned herself, and her breath quickened.</p> <p>Sylvia was not a patient woman. She pulled her hand away from his ass, brought it down to the spot as she did, pushed her fingers as deep as she could. Then she pulled them out again but again. This time the heel of her hand was against his ass.</p> <p>The effect of that and the look on his face was profound. He was panting hard, the first sign of his impending orgasm rising in earnest. He pulled his fingers out from his pussy. Sylvia smiled and licked them. He lifted his ass further off the towel and thrust it back toward her, which she did. His moans became louder, his hips jerked, his head shook back and forth, and he came, explosively, forcefully. She held him gently by the hips, holding him in place, until he calmed down, and his breathing started to calm down.</p> <p>She stepped back, smiled and said, "You know, I think you're one terrific lover."</p> <p>"Yes, I am."</p> <p>"Would you mind if I took your shower to clean up?"</p> <p>"Yes" he breathed, "Not at all."</p> <p>He stripped off his robe, slipped into the shower behind her and she grabbed a towel and led him out. She turned on the water and got in first. They rinsed off. As they stepped out, they looked at their reflections in the mirror and looked at themselves, both naked.</p> <p>"Do you have any idea what a sexy man sounds like?" she asked.</p> <p>"Maybe", he replied.</p> <p>"Mmm, I think it might be great to shower with you, while we're at it.", she whispered to him. She opened the shower door, stepped out, and turned to him. She was standing next to him, letting his eyes roam over her body.</p> <p>"How's about this?" she motioned herself closer to him. He took her face in his hand and kissed her.</p> <p>"I think we're going to get lucky tonight", he said.</p> <p>She reached over and took the towel from him, brought it back toward her, and put her arms around his. "You're not afraid of losing it", she said, "that we're going to make love, that you'll be my man, and I'll be your woman."</p> <p>She kissed his mouth and pushed her tongue hard into his mouth and he groaned into it.</p> <p>"You're not afraid? I mean, what if you get pregnant? Wouldn't you have to get a clean bill of health?" He laughed. "It's up to you if you want to go ahead. But, I'd never hurt you, would I?"</p> <p>"No, not at all!"</p> <p>"What? Oh, all right", he said, "But, you have to get me to leave you alone at this point, in order to make you all right. And, there is still a part of myself that needs to go through this, too. Remember that", she said, "I don't have to leave you because you wanted to be with me. That's all you gotta do, is want me to leave."</p> <p>"No", he said, but said nothing more. He couldn't let her go. He needed her. He couldn't stop himself.</p> <p>She lifted her arms and let him lead her toward the shower. "What's you thinking", he said softly.</p> <p>"That we'll just shower together", she replied. She took his hand and led him to the bed. She undressed him. Then she got on the bed in front of him and turned to show him the bottom of her beautiful naked body. She slid her hands through his hair. "You could do this on your own", she said with a smile. She moved back to the bed and bent over to kiss his feet. She looked over her shoulder and smiled back, so sexy, so desirable.</p> <p>She stood up, turned her back to him, and spread her legs. He looked down into her dripping pussy. He raised himself up on his elbows and looked at her from between her legs. The sight of her made him feel a tingly in his erection.
