She took off her robe and climbed on top of me and began kissing me as she had before. She then moved her mouth over mine and we embraced with a long, passionate kiss. I broke off our embrace, reached down and began to caress her tits. I massaged and squeezed them until she cried out in pleasure. As much as I wanted to make love to her and make her feel as good as she did, I knew it would probably not be so good after a while.</p> <p>I pulled off of her, and she rolled over on her side. Laying herself on her back, she lifted her legs up straight and put them on my shoulders and reached down, guiding the head of my cock to her pussy. I reached down and stroked her pussy lips and slipped a couple of fingers into her and began massaging her clit. She began rocking her hips as she massaged her pussy and clit. I removed my finger and she turned and sat up, turning me on my stomach. Her legs fell open and she guided my cock towards her pussy. I slowly pushed in and she reached down and guided my cock into her pussy. As I was beginning to take her, she placed her hand on my cock, which I was so intent on enjoying until she found that she was dripping wet. As she held it and slowly caressed it, she began rubbing my balls; slowly. I stopped her and she looked down and moaned. She rubbed my ass and began to run her hands up and down on my thighs. Looking back at me and saying, "I love the way you touch me." Without a word, she put her lips to mine and gave me a deep French kiss. We kissed for a few minutes and I pulled her around and got her to straddle me. Laying on my back, she lowered her pussy down on top of me and began rubbing my cock in and out of her pussy. I continued to caress her tits as she moved up and down. I closed my eyes again as her pussy moved up and down on me; in and out, as the pace was quicker.</p> <p>She took my hands and placed them on her tits; she reached with her other hand and put one on my shaft, and placed her lips on mine, taking all of me deep into her mouth. She moved her head down and began sucking me, licking my cock as she sucked on my mouth. She moved her hands to my ass and pulled me deep into her mouth. All of a sudden, she pulled off me and I found myself on my back. A look of pure pleasure and passion flashed on her face and she smiled for a while, looking at me again as she moved up and down to my hard cock.</p> <p>She got off the bed and sat next to me on the floor. She sat on the floor and leaned back, placing her feet apart. I moved my head down and began to lick her pussy lips. As my tongue touched her pussy, she began to moan. I moved my head up and began to lick around her clit again. Once my tongue touched her clit, she went off, moaning and screaming as her pussy flooded my mouth with her warm juice. She lifted herself up and down, rubbing herself on my cock.</p> <p>I moved my head back, allowing more of her sweet nectar to flow. I sucked on her pussy lips and she began to suck on me again. I knew how to take the time to really give her pleasure from a woman, as she would have all the fun. She continued to suck all of my cock until I said, "I want to feel what a woman is like in bed," and she began to move herself back up my body and put herself fully on me. As my shaft returned to it's rigid state, she lowered herself until it entered her; I felt her begin to push herself against my cock, taking me all in. After a few minutes of her riding me, she picked up her pace and began bouncing up and down. I felt myself approaching, as she put the palm of her right hand to the side of my face and pulled me into a kiss. Our tongues dancing together. Her hand cupped my balls. I began to move my hips upward as she did.</p> <p>It was like our sex was going to be the perfect fuck. We were kissing and I felt the end of my cock touching the outer lips of her pussy. She moved her hand, guiding it to my cock. "I want you to fuck me," she said. I lifted her off my cock and moved around to the side of the bed. I moved my mouth to her tits, sucking each one into my mouth, as she pushed her tits hard into my face. She took both tits into her hands and pushed my head lower and I began to suck on her nipples. As my cock slipped into her moist pussy, she began moving her hipsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
