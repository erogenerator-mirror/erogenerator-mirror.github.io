She threw it on the floor before turning around to face him.</p> <p>He reached out, picking it up and setting it on the counter beside him. He reached out with both hands and took hold of each of her hands and put them over his crotch. He smiled at her and looked down at her.</p> <p>Kneeling at her feet, he began kissing along her left leg, and slowly began moving toward her bellybutton. She moaned, and began caressing him with her hands. The heat from between her legs increased as he kissed the soft skin on her outer thighs. She spread her legs a little, allowing him in. He put his hands on her thighs and lifted them so that she could lean back.</p> <p>He lowered his head to kiss her navel, his nose barely touching her. He opened the folds of her panties before moving between the lips of her sex. She was wet and dripping, and he ran his tongue along her lips, pressing against her inner lips. She whimpered as he lightly caressed them with his tongue. Her hands moved to his head, and she began pulling him closer so that he was more of a prisoner. She wanted him inside her now, and he was going to give her his most intimate moments. He slid a hand under her back, and began to caress her breasts, rolling them in his fingers until they were hard and pointed. He sucked one nipple into his mouth, flicking at it with his tongue.</p> <p>She moaned as his tongue flicked at her nub, then began licking at it, then the other. He began to kiss down the front of her stomach as his hands massaged her thighs. He reached her hips and pushed them up, opening them. He kissed down her thighs, and gently teased his way toward her center. As he neared her sex, her legs began to shake and quiver. She was moaning and writhing as he stroked her legs and thighs. She was so sensitive, she could feel him slowly approaching her center as his tongue explored her.</p> <p>He kissed her pussy as he slowly pushed one finger into her, slowly withdrawing it. She moved in her direction with an arch of her back; he could see the slick folds of her inner lips, waiting for him. He inserted a second finger, and began to slowly thrust his fingers in and out of her. She moved her fingers as well, grasping his head as she continued to rock her hips, her center moving along his fingers. He took her hips in his hands, and pressed her forward until his fingers were fully inside of her, his tongue on her clit.</p> <p>She felt like an explosion was rising inside of her. She screamed as she felt a burst of sensation. Her entire body tensed, and she fell forward on the counter behind her.</p> <p>She was in a state of absolute silence. She felt his fingers on her breasts, his lips on her nipples, sucking and biting them. She felt her orgasm rising inside of her. Her breath came in a panting, shuddering noise. She had never experienced such pleasure. With a cry, she fell forward again on the kitchen table, her chest glistening with perspiration, her chest heaving up and down, her face flushed red, her mouth gaped open, and her breasts heaved as she came again and again. When her breathing slowed, she opened her eyes, and smiled at him; he smiled back at her and she reached up and caressed his face.</p> <p>She felt he was in love with her, in a position he was ready to be in, not that he would ever be in love with her, but he had to know she wanted him. She was a woman, and that thought pushed her over the edge again. She began to gyrate her hips again, and he was able to slide a third finger into her. With a sigh, she pushed herself back hard—she liked to be able to bring herself so off on just touching him. She could feel him pressing against her, and his thumb rubbing at her clit, which she wanted him inside of her, as much as she did. Her arms collapsed on the table, and she was at his mercy.</p> <p>He lay down beside her, his face turned upward to hers. He reached out and put his arms around her, holding her close. He slid one hand down to the top of her thigh and began caressing them through the fabric of her trousers. His hand moved down to her knee, slowly, caressing it before moving his hand up her leg. Once more, he could feel her heat on his fingers as he began sliding his finger over her wetness. She made a sound in her throat, and he knew this moment had to end.</p> <p>As he continued his fingers over her flesh, he could feel it—a warmth—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
