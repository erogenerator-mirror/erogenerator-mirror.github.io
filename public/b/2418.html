That would be very rude.”</p> <p>“I don’t, but it is my job to get you off as little as I can.”</p> <p>Again she gave me a kiss. Just a small one I think.</p> <p>“You are a sexy young man.”</p> <p>“I want you.”</p> <p>“I’m not.”</p> <p>“Let’s not get on the subject of getting you off and getting you in the mood for something a lot more serious.”</p> <p>“I think I can handle that. And no kissing. This is our time.”</p> <p>She took off her skirt, leaving her only wearing her black silk panties. I don’t know if the thought of a young man watching her undress made her feel guilty but she put it down to my being in the business, that she was having a relationship that might, well be too good to have any kind of sex life. Plus, she didn’t want to be the one in the middle of it. To be blunt, I wanted this so much and I was a bit worried how I felt if she saw it on my face.</p> <p>“Don’t worry,” she said. “This has been a busy day for me. I can’t tell you how happy and pleased I’ve been with you. The video got to be the most exciting thing ever. I am really glad I got a chance with you, and I hope I will find you again in the world.”</p> <p>We kissed again and I was aching to take her again. I slid down her body, kissing her deeply as my fingers trailed down her back to her ass. She didn’t seem to be a little nervous.</p> <p>“I think you enjoyed what we did.”</p> <p>“Yes,” she said, smiling.</p> <p>“I am sure glad I got to see you naked.”</p> <p>She giggled. “I hope so. I had no idea there would be this much excitement when I was around.”</p> <p>She pushed away from the desk, straddling my still hard cock and leaned down to kiss me. My cock was still rock hard.</p> <p>“But I want you there. So don’t hold back.”</p> <p>She sat down on me, taking all of me, but stopping to look at me.</p> <p>“I want you to have the best fuck of your life,” she said, taking me in her hand and guiding me to where she wanted me.</p> <p>“The best cock of your life.”</p> <p>She pulled off her panties and lay back on me, spreading her legs and lowering her clit to the edge of my face.</p> <p>“Kiss me!” was all she said as I licked her clit, sucking it and lightly biting on it with my teeth. I did most of the kissing, but I was still hard.</p> <p>“Oh God! That feels good! Yes, kiss me! Please! Please!”</p> <p>“We need to change your fucking position before anyone sees it. They might think you’re an animal,” I said, licking her clit some more.</p> <p>“O.k.”</p> <p>With the same thing happened to her pussy, she pulled me up to her and began kissing me again, running her fingers through my hair, massaging my arms. By then there were two men standing beside me, talking to us men. One of them was obviously the owner of the store, and this one was a local college basketball star.</p> <p>“I want you to cum.” He began. “Just lie back and let me drive my cock into you.”</p> <p>“No!”</p> <p>“I want to see you cum!”</p> <p>The one with the black dick said louder</p> <p>“Can you get him off? I know you will!”</p> <p>Again the one he said, I wasn’t sure if the other was a man or a woman but I felt my body responding.</p> <p>“I want you to cum, I want to swallow your cum, I want to get you off. You’re gonna like this!”</p> <p>He took it all one more time and pushed me onto my back—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
