She began kissing her way down her torso while looking up at me.</p> <p>I sat on the couch and leaned back waiting my turn. I sat back up and put the panties in my pocket.</p> <p>'So, I know I just made a big mistake and this will never be the end of it, but there's no need to be embarrassed about this, is there?'</p> <p>I simply didn't know what to say, so instead turned on a red haze.</p> <p>'You had better get going and save your self time. If I'm ever in the mood to play this card again, I want you to be on your back when I do!'</p> <p>I heard the drawer open and close and then the door close.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>I felt a chill as I drove straight to the store, knowing now that I'd have to take off my clothes. I didn't want to get a run in with my boss, which I would most probably never do.</p> <p>I knew he'd come to the door once I unlocked it. With a devilish grin, I knew he was going to see all he would and not just the panties.</p> <p>After all, I knew he'd notice. I didn't want him to. I wanted to be humiliated, humiliated but also humiliated and in control when it came.</p> <p>My skirt was still in the back seat and a wet spot was visible from where the panty liner started to cramp up. I knew I should just take it off, but my cunt was burning again.</p> <p>After what seemed like an eternity of indecision, I took my shoes off and walked into the employee bathroom.</p> <p>I stepped into the shower with anticipation. I heard the shower running, but it didn't feel like any kind of sexual thing. I needed this.</p> <p>I felt the water hitting my body. It made me think of my husband, Bill, who I loved, and how it'd been a great relationship with him. I needed to let loose and see where this was taking me.</p> <p>I could feel the shampoo and body wash running through my hair. It felt as though my hair were being rubbed and unbound, freeing me to get under my own skin. It felt sexy.</p> <p>I turned the shower off and felt the lather running all over my body, making me feel dirty, dirty and excited all at the same time.</p> <p>I lathered the whole body, moving all over my legs feeling the way my body was being touched.</p> <p>The water washing me up to my tits and down to my pussy, touching me everywhere and making me feel totally dirty. I closed my eyes and just let the water wash me the best it could.</p> <p>The water running down my body, touching my tits, my legs and my pussy had me really feeling dirty.</p> <p>After washing me, still feeling like I could get out of control, I took a step over to the vanity.</p> <p>As I reached over, I felt the tension starting to build inside me again.</p> <p>I looked in the mirror and saw how all my hair was rained all over me with the water, the scent of my body, and the sensation of the warm shower hitting me, making my stomach start to turn. It was just the two of me.</p> <p>I was in another world and only knew that at this moment I needed to stop.</p> <p>I slowly turned to my own house and put the body wash away in the vanity. As I washed the body spray over my own neck I could feel my fingers slowly rub over my nipples, pinching my nipples until they were hard, sending another shiver down my body.</p> <p>I turned and looked at myself in the mirror. It was a new feeling, one I never knew existed. I felt very vulnerable without any clothes on.</p> <p>I finished drying my body and I walked across the house with a purpose. I reached out my hand, grabbed a towel, and walked towards the front door, all the while looking into the eyes of my husband.</p> <p>I waited and waited.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>I took my keys and made up my mind.</p> <p>I was going to fuck him.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>I pulled out of the driveway and rushed down the path. I didn't want to see either of them and as I made it to the end of the driveway my eyes widened.</p> <p>And my pulse was racing.</p> <p>And my mind was racing with indecision.</p> <p>I had to know.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>I took a deep breath, a little nervous, and took the steps to his house.</p> <p>I knocked on the doorâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
