I whispered in her ear, caressing her face, her jawline, her collarbone. Her eyes looked so beautiful. My hand continued to caress her skin, down the inside of her leg, down the inside of her thigh. Her eyes closed as I stroked closer and closer to her core. My finger reached her soft, warm center, parting those labia and finding the hardening center of those moist lips. Our eyes met, she stared into mine as I dipped my finger in her pussy juices, rubbing around her clit and her body lurched as I pressed my finger deeper and deeper into her body. A soft gasp came from her lips, she pushed her hips back against my hand as I finger-fucked her, my finger pressing the soft tissues within her womanhood.</p> <p>"Please... fuck me...oh god..." She moaned as her hips lifted, grinding against my hand with greater intensity. "Please, oh God... just fuck me...don't stop...". "I don't, uh... stop. I know you wanted this..." I whispered, pulling back the hood of her labia and gazing into her beautiful face. She smiled as I took her chin in my hand and kissed her lips, which parted and our tongues danced. She pulled my head close, holding me in a tender embrace, her breath coming in little short gasps. I leaned slightly forward, sliding my free arm over her body and lifting the top of her dress. I lifted her bra above the swell of her breasts as my tongue swirled around her nipples. I felt her legs wrapping tightly around my waist, drawing me closer to her. My hand left her breast and slowly slid down over her flat belly, over her hips and lower to gently stroke her mound. She squirmed and moaned as my finger dipped under the elastic of her panties and gently pushed them aside. I lifted her slightly, drawing her leg away from my body.</p> <p>I looked into her eyes and, with my free hand, brought the tip of my cock to the tender flesh of her thighs. Her eyes closed at my touch and she pulled her hips up higher as I gently lowered my cock between her thighs, rubbing up and down her wet gash.</p> <p>"M...mm..." She breathed, reaching for my hand to run her fingers over my fingers. She kissed her fingers, then pulled me to her. Her lips met mine and she sucked the tip of my tongue between her lips. My lips followed suit and we kissed with desire. Her hand had found my cock, stroking along it and her lips left mine. "Come on," she commanded. I let my hips move up and down in a slow circular motion, pressing against her, feeling her body press up against mine. Her thighs moved up and down mine, her body was pressed against mine with each downward stroke. Our eyes spoke volumes. It was as though we were one, just a pair, a couple, a couple who were not at all, but joined at the groin. We stared into each other's eyes, our chests moving in time.</p> <p>Her hand had released my cock as I lowered my body to hers - her other hand reached back and began caressing my chest. Her nails lightly stroked my back. Her eyes opened and we looked at each other for only a moment before we resumed our dance of the night. Her lips left mine and, instead, they moved to my neck, moving sensually over the smooth, salty skin. She leaned into me as she gently tugged my zipper down.</p> <p>I looked down at the woman standing before me. From my angle, I could see the shadow of her head on the other side of her shoulders. The moonlight was shining in her face as she slowly lowered herself to her knees. My cock was rock hard and throbbing as she dropped her head into my lap. I looked up from her pussy to the head, which she was still rubbing up and down my cock, watching my own eyes. She smiled up at me and leaned her head forward. Her wet folds pressed into the shaft of my cock. Her tongue flicked out, just once; the tip of it flicked across the head. She brought her pussy up to the head of my penis, sliding my entire length between her lips, sliding down towards my stomach, back up to the tip before retreating again, slowly, firmly and steadily. Her head began to bob up and down slowly, the skin around my cock slick with her juices.</p> <p>"Oh God, yes, yes, yes..." I managed, my voice barely comprehensible. Her tits were swaying as she slid downward. I could not take my eyes off the beauty before my head. Her eyes were closed - each eye was closed, even though her mouth was open, but they remained open. I wanted to see more of her and her body, to feel her flesh in my hands and feel her breasts against me and ourâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
