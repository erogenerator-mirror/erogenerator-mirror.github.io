"You can't just..." Before she could finish her sentence she regretted it as more cock slammed into her.</p> <p>"Hmmm, now don't you dare forget it. That's your word against mine. " My pussy was so wet by now that she loved to feel the sensation even after he was finished making her wait.</p> <p>"I'm close to coming, don't stop."</p> <p>His words were all that made me lose control. My pussy clenched around his cock even harder as I heard him moan and I felt him tense and then release deep inside of me. Feeling him explode inside of me had me on the edge of an orgasm and as he pulled out I knew he was just as close.</p> <p>"Let's clean up and we'll talk."</p> <p>He left me standing there as he took a deep breath and walked around to the other side of me and sat down next to me. I leaned against him and he wrapped one arm around me as he held one of my arms and his other hand rested over my pussy.</p> <p>"This way you can tell what I'm up to when you get ready."</p> <p>"Hmmm, this could be fun." The two of us were leaning back against the couch now and he was massaging my breasts with one hand cupping one. The other hand rested softly against my crotch, a few inches away from my crotch as we lay and watched the porn she was watching on the computer. I let his hand slip to my thigh and he cupped it and then slowly lifted the leg high and then brought it down, lifting it higher on the couch and finally over onto the floor, almost falling off of it. I couldn't hold myself up any longer as I lay there trying to catch my breath.</p> <p>"I see you've decided this is a game." "No." he said almost sternly.</p> <p>He brought his hand around and pulled up on the strap of my right nipple causing me to moan before he stopped.</p> <p>"That's not fair that we're in the middle of this."</p> <p>"Are you complaining?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>He smiled at me and I knew something would be done about that.</p> <p>"You know I want this. Do you want anything? How much do you want to cum inside me?"</p> <p>His mouth was on me before I could answer and the answer was obvious as my nipples tightened as he leaned down and sucked both of them into his mouth one at a time and his hand moved onto them, stroking them while he gently kissed them and I felt his fingers sliding down between my legs. His hand kept rubbing the front of my pussy, spreading my moisture around and over my lips and making my body tingle all over.</p> <p>"I'm ready." He managed to say before he was pulled away and I saw a drop of clear fluid drip out of my swollen pussy lips.</p> <p>"You're still leaking." "Didn't know it was so important for you." "Oh it's so messy." "I've never done this before."</p> <p>"I love it and want you to feel it."</p> <p>He moved his hand quickly down and scooped up a bit more of my wetness and brought it up to his mouth. He sucked my lips into his mouth and I arched forward wanting desperately to be closer to him.</p> <p>"I love you so much. I love fucking you...oh god." I closed my eyes as his tongue traced over my lips and slowly into my mouth. He let go of my lips and let them hang limp across my body as he looked at me while he let my hands roam through his hair. His tongue was in my mouth and his lips were pressed hard into mine. His fingers stroked my clitoris and I could feel an explosion building quickly. My legs tightened around his back and my knees got weak as I knew I couldn't hold on much longer.</p> <p>"Oh I love you so much."</p> <p>His words and those eyes were enough to make me start off the right way.</p> <p>"Don't stop." I couldn't even imagine what I was saying. He pulled me on top of him as his hands slipped between my legs and he moved one finger between my lips and I felt the coolness of it against my skin. He moved his hand until another finger slid inside me and the same sensation began from my other side.</p> <p>"Oh I hope you're ready," I heard myself say.</p> <p>"I'm more than ready," he said as he pulled my body up until we were on my knees and I felt his cock resting inside of me. "Oh honey, we never..." I could only moan as he started to pull out of me.</p> <p>"I didn't say you had toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
