In less than half an hour, Mike's outfit had arrived for his dinner date with his wife. He didn't look at all like he was going to be doing any cooking tonight, with all of the work he had to do. Mike was still a little confused, having no idea of what he wanted with Maria.</p> <p>With his wife out of the picture, Mike started on his list of other responsibilities she must have forgotten about, as well. At the end of the day, Mike had worked on the plans for the second night she had invited him to visit a friend of hers, an old lady he had met at a party once on this trip. With Maria being his friend, Mike knew she would want to try out something that he had never really thought of. Maybe she wanted to try out his idea of a long trip, and some fun. All Mike knew was he wanted to give her something that she didn't have. Something nice and exciting. Mike didn't mind going on a few short weeks without. He really didn't feel like going to dinner on a Saturday evening. But in the morning the thoughts of Maria and going to bed with her did turn him on as much as it did her friend. After a few weeks, Mike could make it on that first night of the summer. Maria had talked him into it. She was going to let him have a little more freedom with her on a Saturday.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Chapter Eleven : Dinner</p> <p>Mike sat down at the kitchen table after dinner as Maria went through her list of things everyone should do for dinner. Mike was thinking about how Maria had explained how he should be punished for his bad thoughts. Since she had already told him to bring her back home when she went to bed with the promise of a nice weekend at home, Mike thought it was only fair that he should do the same.</p> <p>Mike had been a little bit worried about what Maria would think when she came back to the house. How would she think when he left with a hard cock. But she had been very nice all day. But he didn't think about him.</p> <p>As Mike's mind was churning with the thoughts he was going to have to work through, Maria finished up the list of things she was going to buy. She was going to buy two pair of high heels, and a new necklace, earrings, and a set of rings. She would use her new shoes as accessories and would be wearing them after dinner.</p> <p>Mike couldn't wait to get out of work. He was nervous, but also excited, and he could hardly wait to get out of the store and make Maria a nice dinner to celebrate with.</p> <p>Maria was dressed in a beautiful red dress. The skirt barely covered her hips, it had a split up the back to just above her thigh and the top was just above her breasts.</p> <p>Mike's eyes were drawn to Maria's legs as she started the cart. Every time she bent over she had to look in the mirror to make sure the straps was still in place. Mike's cock was straining to get out of his pants and as he was imagining getting it back for Maria, he started to rub his cock through his pants, and Maria noticed it. Maria smiled to herself. She was enjoying this little game.</p> <p>Maria started to open her closet and picked out a pair of red silk stockings. Mike had tried to keep on his best behavior, but this would be the first time the two of them would be at a party. Maria smiled at him as he was standing there nervously. Her eyes were still on him, scanning his body. Mike was standing there not really trying to look sexy, just not sure what to do about it.</p> <p>Maria pulled out her black velvet bag and had Mike sit down when she finished. Mike had just stood up and put his shoes on when she gave him the bag. Mike smiled up at Maria as she handed her the bag. Mike didn't know what to think. Was she ready to take the first step on the step that turned into the second step? Was she going to walk around the house like some whore that had been waiting for him to come home? He watched her hands as she pulled out the items. They were a set of black silk stockings, and matching g-string.</p> <p>The first outfit she brought was the one he bought for this particular weekend. He had tried hard to get the last outfit to include panties, but he justâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
