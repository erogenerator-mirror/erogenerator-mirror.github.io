He grinned. "She's a hottie, not sexy."</p> <p>My cheeks flushed.</p> <p>"Is it that obvious?" I teased. "She's got a big, hot pussy."</p> <p>"Well, I know I shouldn't have." He winked. "But I know just as well as you do that she's got a sweet body. I don't have to say anything I wouldn't share. She's hot."</p> <p>"Hmm?" I looked away, turning back to him. "How do you know I'm hot?"</p> <p>"You're damn good," He said. "You're the hottest woman I've ever been with." His hands slid back down and cupped my waist, pulling me towards him to kiss. "So, have you tried out the rest of your sexy new friend?"</p> <p>"I don't know."</p> <p>"You're just a dumb blonde." He slapped me on the ribs. "And let's not get carried away. She might like you."</p> <p>"Thanks," I smiled, turning around and pressing my back against the wall. I was acutely aware of his eyes on me, watching me through the steam. I turned on my side and looked at my hair, the strands of it hanging loosely down over my shoulders. I cupped my hands over my breasts, feeling the cold of the water hit me at my nipples.</p> <p>"She loves you," Nate said. "You know it, right?"</p> <p>I nodded, breathing deep. This was going way too fast.</p> <p>Nate's lips found mine, and his lips pressed against mine, slipping between them. I ran my fingers over his jawline as his mouth slid down my cheek. My head fell back and Nate wrapped his arm around me, pulling me closer while he kissed me. Our foreheads were touching, and I felt warm. The warmth and the scent of him. We could almost hear the traffic in the street outside while my body felt all warm and soft. I reached my hand down to his hip and felt a tent in his pants. His cock hardened inside his jeans as he pressed against me. I could feel the heat in the fabric of his jeans, and my fingertips grazed over his length. I wanted, no, I yearned to feel him hard and throbbing in my hand. I wanted to stroke him, to taste his skin.</p> <p>I slipped my hands into Nate's hair, pulling up, and we were face to face for a moment before he pulled the hair back, his lips brushing against mine. I felt his tongue run along the inside of my lips, and I let out a moan.</p> <p>"That feels so good," Nate said, kissing my neck. "Did you forget where you were?"</p> <p>I moaned again, and Nate's hand cupped the back of my head, brushing my hair away. His hands moved down and slid over my jeans to my thighs, sliding my legs around his hips. My legs felt so warm and smooth, yet my skin was a tight knot, strangling my legs around his waist.</p> <p>"God you're so hot," Nate breathed against my neck. He slid into my cleavage again.</p> <p>"God I want you so bad." I lifted one big breast up and let out a loud moan.</p> <p>"You are something."</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>There was no need to answer, as Nate was already fucking hard against me right there.</p> <p>"I've been looking at your legs all day," he whispered in my ear. "Mm, they're so pretty and I could just eat them right here and right now. You'd take me, wouldn't you?"</p> <p>I couldn't answer a yes, no. I was a married woman here. This was just sex after all. We hadn't been together in...</p> <p>Nate's cock slid out of me, leaving me open and empty. I gasped, my hips lifting into his lap, searching for the throbbing cock that just moments ago was pressing gently against my thighs. This time, I was going to get it. There was no turning back. With a moan of desperation, I grabbed Nate's ass and held on as he slid his tongue into my mouth, tangling it with mine.</p> <p>"Don't say no." Nate pushed my hands out of the way and held me to his body. My body tingled in response, and my legs tightened around his waist.</p> <p>His hands roamed over my breasts, his mouth devouring mine in a delicious, passionate duel. His hands continued to caress their way downward, running through my hair and down my back. He kissed down my neck and I felt him fiddle with my shirt. I moaned, arching my body against him, my mouth opening, begging him to take it off.</p> <p>"I wantâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
