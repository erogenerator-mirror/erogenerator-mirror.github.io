I know that he is my boy, and he loves me."</p> <p>"Are you okay?" The man put his hand on the woman's shoulder and kissed her softly on the jaw. The older woman's expression was of sadness and concern, but for a moment that was gone.</p> <p>"He doesn't want to go that far." It was all the woman could say.</p> <p>"I'm sorry but I don't know that I can take much more of this."</p> <p>"That's okay. It's not like we want him to put away hard things.

There's a very nice pub a couple of blocks down from here. Just take my number. I'm not at liberty to show it to anyone else. I'll take everything that you have to show me."</p> <p>Mike didn't know who was more excited about this new friend: sex or sex with another man! Their relationship had become a little weird, but it didn't seem to be anything special. "I'm in a relationship with a man who wants both. He wants both of us to want him."</p> <p>"Does he always have someone in mind?" Allison smiled as the young man closed the door behind them and walked down the street.</p> <p>The couple sat in the car, watching the lights go on. Mike pulled out of the driveway. "Want dinner?
