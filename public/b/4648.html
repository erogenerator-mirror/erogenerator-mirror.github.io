Then she reached out toward me and pulled me in for a quick kiss, then, taking the glass, she set it down, and held out her hand saying, "Follow me."</p> <p>I followed her to a door that led to my private playroom. I saw the door and a large round wooden table that stood at the end of the room.</p> <p>"Sit!" she commanded. I moved to the end of the table, sat on the floor, put my hands behind my back, and spread my legs.</p> <p>"On your hands and knees," she said. She left her voice as she exited the room. I waited for what seemed a very long time. The room was huge. The walls were glass and covered in mirrors all around, and on the tabletop were several leather straps and chains with chains attached together. The table was covered by a white leather sofa.</p> <p>"Lie face-down on the floor," she said. "Lie on your back."</p> <p>I lay on my back with my hands behind me and my legs slightly apart. I felt the chains pulling my ankles apart, and knew I couldn't move them without hurting myself, but I wasn't going to say anything without giving myself a second chance.</p> <p>She pulled the straps tight and pulled tight again. I felt a warm, wet sensation being rubbed over my buttocks. Then a warm, strong, oiling made my insides, warm and pink.</p> <p>I heard a belt being unsnapped. Then I felt something being pushed in between my buttocks. It moved upwards to my vagina lips and then pushed itself in with more force, stretching them ever wider. It made quite a loud 'plop'.</p> <p>"Ooh!" I cried out.</p> <p>"Is that a 'plop'?" she said with a smile.</p> <p>I could only nod my head in surprise. Then she pushed hard and my insides began to spasm. I felt the heat of my orgasm increase rapidly.</p> <p>"Yes!" I heard.</p> <p>Then I felt something being pressed into my vagina. The cold metal rubbed against my vagina. She moved up and down from time to time, sliding inside me. Her fingers were pulling on my clitoris as she pushed in and out. I felt her breasts bouncing up and down.</p> <p>She suddenly stopped. I felt the tension and tension drain from me. The only thing left was to move my pelvis to make myself available to her, when she pulled herself from me.</p> <p>She stood and walked around the table several times, inspecting me from several angles. Then she turned my face up to the mirror, where she saw my face in the mirror, and bent over, with her legs straddling mine.</p> <p>I felt a finger pressing against my anus as she rubbed it back and forth. Then her finger entered my anus as she rubbed my clitoris with her free hand. She pulled on my clitoris with the other hand, as she pulled on my pussy.</p> <p>Then I felt her lips around my clitoris, sucking on it very hard with her mouth. Then she slid her tongue in, as she sucked on my clit.</p> <p>I could only moan and wriggle my pelvis. She was sucking and rubbing my clitoris with such force that my pussy was squirming and my orgasm was building ever higher.</p> <p>Then I felt her lips on my clitoris as she sucked on it the same way as the rest of my clitoris is sucked. She pulled on my clitoris with her lips as she rubbed me, making me moan even more.</p> <p>Then I felt it build again, as I felt my first ever orgasm. The warm feeling inside me grew, as she rubbed me with her finger in my pussy.</p> <p>I could still feel her tongue flicking my clitoris.</p> <p>Before I felt any strength returning, I heard her voice say, "No more!" as she pulled herself from my cunt and sat on the edge of the table, removing her strap.</p> <p>"That was so wonderful," she said, looking at my face in the mirror. "Thank you."</p> <p>She removed her dress and lay back with her legs spread apart. Then she pushed a finger in and pushed it in and out.</p> <p>"Oh!" I cried out.</p> <p>"That's nice," she said. "Let me do the talking. I want to enjoy you."</p> <p>She slid down my body, until she was kneeling between my legs. She rubbed her hands all over my belly and upper body, with the tips of her fingers. I felt her hands pressing against my breasts, sliding up and down.</p> <p>She took her fingers out of my pussy, and placed them on my lips. Then she pulled me closer to herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
