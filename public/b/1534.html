"It wasn't very erotic, really; I'm still not really into that, anyway."</p> <p>She smiled at my explanation and laughed a little. "No, I'm not into that either." She took a deep breath and let it out slowly. "I like sex, with you, more than anything else. As soon as we get a chance it's like nothing happened, I like it. It's been a while for me and I'm not at all ready with it if it's just for a little while. For us though it seems to be, if you don't mind me saying, I had always had a bit of a crush on you. Even before I had met you I knew that I wouldn't be able to trust you."</p> <p>I laughed at that, and we continued holding each other's hands. "You sure got that out didn't you, now you have a problem. I don't want to go a lot to fast. You're a very special young woman at that age. I'll take my chances."</p> <p>We held each other hand in the dark for a while until we heard someone running down the hall. It was Mary Beth, she had been in the house this time and seemed to have heard us both. "Hola, you two, I just went back to the bathroom. What's up now?"</p> <p>Mary Beth answered, "She called for the limousine and said she wanted to run a few errands then she would be back in just a couple of hours."</p> <p>This was Mary Beth's first visit to the office since this was all new. In the meantime we continued our conversation in relative quiet to get to know each other a little better. "So," she said as a matter of fact. "I've been wondering if you had something planned for the next week while I'm away; what would you like for lunch, that is?" At that moment I felt something pressing against my leg. "Oh, that, well, you know I've been thinking of something for a while. How about we meet this coming Friday after you come home from work."</p> <p>"Ok, meet me at the house around nine?" I thought to myself. I knew where this meeting was going to lead, I just assumed it would be about getting my mind off sex.</p> <p>It took Mary Beth only a couple of minutes to pull up to Mary Beth's house. At the door she pulled me inside and said, "Hey, you're not the only one in an erotic mood tonight." She pulled and kissed me hard a couple of times, her mouth hungrier than ever. The kiss went on and on for several minutes, her tongue probing my mouth and making me respond with passion. She broke the lip lock and kissed me again. "I think you're ready now," she giggled. "Do you want me to take you to the bedroom first?" "Well, maybe not quite yet and I'd love to have you on your back, but after that, I guess we should probably eat first."</p> <p>We cleaned each other up a bit then she led me by my hand into her bedroom. She had on a satin robe, the front open revealing a lot of cleavage but not much else. We didn't hurry, we just made the most of her gown and as our hands got to feel and explore each other there weren't an ounce of shyness or regret between us again. We were naked in the middle of our bedroom with our bodies pressed together, my hard on pressing through the folds of her satin robe, as she lay down on her back, her beautiful breasts hanging heavy over her chest. I was right, I love this older lady. "You know what I'm thinking?" I asked and she just lay there with her eyes closed and nodded her head. "Well do you think I should take this off?" "God, yes, take it off, take it off. Do you want me to be naked too?" I asked.</p> <p>"Hell, yes," she said and raised her head, her hair flying around her face. "Just take it easy," she said. "You aren't going anywhere, I'm all yours." She laughed and rolled over and began to kiss my stomach, working slowly her hand down and then down and lower. I wanted to make love to her so, so much I grabbed each breast and squeezed their fullness. It was just right and when I felt the nipple begin to stiffen a little it was like I was stroking my cock. "Oh, you're going to make me cum, aren't you?" "Mmmmm." she answered me. She kissed down my stomach, starting at the very top, then, she skipped over my dick and kissed the tip, my nuts, down my shaft, down to the pubic hair. "Mmmmm, it's so hairy thereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
