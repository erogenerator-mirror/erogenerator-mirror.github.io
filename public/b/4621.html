Oh, that was fabulous. I had no idea a woman like you were a lady of good taste." She held him by one of his hands and then she released it. Standing up she smiled a big smile and patted him on the butt. "Come," she said, leading him toward the bedroom.</p> <p>He followed her, standing there, his shorts and briefs around his ankles as she sat down on the bed. He knelt on the rug near the foot of the bed; his eyes dropped to her feet. She lay back on the bed, the towel sliding to the floor as she lifted her feet to his face. She smiled when she saw his mouth water just for a moment as he sucked a toe in and sucked away, then she reached down and grasped his erection.</p> <p>"Now that you've earned it don't be shy about taking it." She leaned back, putting her arms behind her head. He gazed about the room longingly as he took in her beauty before him and when he raised himself again he saw a huge, hard, and waiting erection. He didn't need anything else.</p> <p>His hands kneaded at his own breasts, cupping each one. He closed his eyes and then lifted his mouth from each mauled nipple. He moved his pelvis down to where his erection rubbed against the carpet. His other hand found a way to open his lips a bit at the bottom of the foot. He pushed it between them and touched it to his mouth. It tasted like soap and pine. He opened his eyes again and looked at himself in the full-length mirror.</p> <p>She stood, her face in the mirror, her breasts jiggling. He took in her body in the mirror and he saw the nipples of her areolas and the nipples of a nipple. He leaned forward, his face lowering into her hair, running his lips up and down the silky strands, kissing and licking her. She let out a soft giggle as he passed from one to the other, taking each one in his mouth. He moved his mouth back, letting his tongue flicker down the bottom, making her moan.</p> <p>He looked at her face, her eyes closed, hands reaching back to stroke her thighs. She watched his mouth and hands as they moved over her, moving and then coming away again. His fingers traced her outer lips, dipping into the soft flesh. He rubbed his fingers down to her hole, pushing two fingers inside him as his lips kissed and lapped at her. She felt the head of his cock move between her legs.</p> <p>"Oh, yes, take it and fuck me."</p> <p>"I don't want to hurry," he said huskily, moving his hips slightly. "I want to make you feel as much as I can make you."</p> <p>He moved his hips, her legs opening a little wider as she felt his cock push past her outer lips. He watched her face as his cock slid deeper into her. He was still looking in the mirror watching his cock disappear into her body and then disappear again, and again. He felt the lips of her vagina stretch around him. He closed his eyes and heard a muffled groan. He opened them when the head of his cock was almost completely out of her, then pushed, holding himself still until his cock was fully embedded in her body again. The feeling of her warmth filled him and then it slid out, wet around the sides of his cockhead.</p> <p>He opened his eyes again and looked into the mirror just as his cockhead was withdrawn. He closed his eyes and waited for the second time. The look he saw crossed his face when he felt the cock pull out a second time. The head of his cock was wet and coated with her juices. He moved his hand between his legs, pulling his shaft up to his stomach and squeezing it tightly. He looked at his cock in the mirror. The shaft had a look of a man with a woman. He wanted to cum, wanted to cum on himself, wanted to have his face imprinted on his cock to show, to mark his cock as he shot his sperm on himself. It was all he could give.</p> <p>She came up to lay alongside him. He felt her bare breast pressing into his side. He felt a finger touch a nipple between his thumb and forefinger. He felt them tighten around his nipple, feeling the hard little nub swell against his hand. She put an arm around him, laying her head on his shoulder and his hand between her legs. Both he and she had just started their own pleasures.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," she said. "You're so big and hard. I can't wait for next time," she cooed as she stroked his cock slowly in time with her hand. His own fingers were caressing his own body, stroking his nipples, pressingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
