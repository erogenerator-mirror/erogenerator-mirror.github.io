It felt so good, she knew she didn't care who was in the room or who was listening. The idea that all that could go on and so many different people could know about it made her all the more wet. Her cunt squirted with her release and she continued to squeeze her eyes shut knowing that anyone watching and listening was going to know more, more as she was going through her own little explosion. It was all she could take and she came harder then she ever had before in her life!</p> <p>“Oh my god, oh yes, oh god, oh god.” She cried as the waves subsided, and she was still, she was shaking from the orgasm from the orgasm she had just experienced.</p> <p>He removed his fingers from her cunt and moved his fingers to her mouth. She greedily sucked and licked them clean. She couldn't remember anything else but what she had and couldn't remember. She knew they all loved her now. If they didn’t love her it would break their hearts.</p> <p>“Now that I have your full attention," he said, taking his cock in his hand and lowering the head of it to her cunt.</p> <p>He was already hard again. She lifted her legs to let him enter her, and her hands went straight to her cunt. He was already in and he had his big dick in her cunt. She put her hands on his balls and they slid along her fingertips as he worked it in and out of her. This made their way into her cunt as she was lifting her hips to meet his.</p> <p>He started fucking her. He knew he could probably last forever. He was so gentle, loving, tender, not demanding, but just giving in to her, her body, her feelings. He was so good at that. She could feel him swelling and he loved it that she was making such a noise. She could feel it coming. Her pussy was squeezing around his dick which was now making noises too. It didn't matter that she didn't have full control of herself, because all she wanted was her orgasm. She pushed him down deeper and felt him go inside her while he was still fucking her. She just closed her eyes and just enjoyed the sensations. She was so tight, so wet and so horny. She had never been so wet then, as it was around his cock.</p> <p>Her mind was focused on the pleasure he was giving her. She was lost in that state now. There was a tingle in her cunt, like she had been with him all morning. She just closed her eyes again, and enjoyed the feeling of his big dick as he fucked her.</p> <p>“Oh yes, it’s so good,” she moaned. “Feels so great, is so good."</p> <p>Her head was thrashing about side to side and she was still bouncing up and down on his dick. She knew he was getting close, so she held him as she rocked over his big cock, getting closer. She held him hard and they didn't let up, only slowed then stopped again just a minute. This was something she remembered with her husband, when they made love. It made everything else seem more intense.</p> <p>He started fucking her faster and she lifted herself a bit more to meet him. He started fucking her really slow and deep now while holding his dick deep inside her. Their bodies made a sloshing noise and she moaned loud enough for the other to hear. She knew how hard and long it would make him, that he would go as hard as she had. She had never met anyone who could get that far, much less give her a climax like with another man.</p> <p>“Oh baby," she said looking over his shoulder as he drove into her harder. She lifted her legs and moved forward and was now fucking him back harder still. She could barely move her hips to match his, but she loved that feeling so much. She was going crazy. She wanted to keep fucking and cum, but she couldn't. He was in heaven now and she was loving everything about it.</p> <p>She came like never before at that moment. Every nerve in her body was on fire, she didn't bother to count to herself. She felt that she might lose consciousness if she were to do it again while they were engaged in love making. She didn't care though. She just knew this was just how she wanted it to be and no one had ever done this to her before. She didn't care if it was her or he. She loved what he was doing, loved what he was making her feel. She loved the feeling of his big cock as it thrust and fucked against her cunt walls. Her whole body was electric. She didn't care about the fact that anyone else would see and hear. She was just cumming and cumming inside another man, her lovemaking partner—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
