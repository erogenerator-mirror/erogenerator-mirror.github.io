He stood up and undid his slacks saying, "Nice." and pulled his cock out before she could answer him again, "This is for you stud." and gave it a few strokes before saying, "I think I might have to take care of this right now, let's grab a beer..."</p> <p>Jenna looked at him with a little smile on her lips and said, "OK, lets hit the bed."</p> <p>She went back into the kitchen after grabbing a beer, and returned in half a minute with two glasses, "This should be a lot more comfortable." Jenna laughed and pointed to a mirror at the kitchen counter. The bed was still on, but the sheets were back. He walked back over to her.</p> <p>He took his cock in his hand and moved it up and down a few times but Jenna had not touched it and he had to get a grip. He pushed back on it and Jenna said. "You did this last time." and then smiled.</p> <p>He smiled, "That's ok, I want to do it again, but then again, this time I may just finish the job."</p> <p>"You don't finish without me. That is so hot!"</p> <p>Jenna said, "You are so lucky man."</p> <p>"Not really buddy or wife. But I do have my other friends that do."</p> <p>"They are not as good as me and their wife. They both are really great!"</p> <p>Jenna got up from the kitchen counter got their beers and walked towards the bed and said, "I want this to go on for a while though, it has only been half a day and I am kind of tired."</p> <p>"That is ok Jenna."</p> <p>She smiled as they both sat down on the end of the bed. The bed was much too big for them, so they both sat down on the side of it and began to rub his cock.</p> <p>Jenna said, "Do you mind if I get under the bed first?"</p> <p>"Uh, OK, go ahead," he replied.</p> <p>He lay down on his back and Jenna crawled over him to sit on his cock. Once again, she moved up and down on the shaft making him moan a little, but not for long. After several minutes, Jenna pulled herself off completely and positioned herself over him. Leaning forward, Jenna lowered herself down on his cock, moaning as it went into her. She began to move up and down taking him almost completely in her pussy she pulled herself up a little and he moaned and felt her pussy tightening around his cock. He moved his hips and began to fuck up into her, making her moan louder. He was still lying there enjoying her movements on his cock, but now they were both really starting to work on the other. Their moans became louder, Jenna's breathing heavier. She began to move her ass up and down on his cock, making him moan loudly and she moaned again. They were both enjoying the sensation of their bodies moving against each other as they fucked like two teenagers. As they were moaning, Jenna moved to put her leg over his cock and started to play with his balls.</p> <p>Jenna stopped moving and asked "Do you think we could work some of this out right here?" as she lifted herself off his cock. She got on all fours looking at his face and saw the expression on his face. She smiled. "Sure let's." She got off the bed and knelt down, which left room for Jenna. She lowered her head onto his cock and began to rub it along her slit. She moaned and looked up at him, "I like teasing a little..." She began to lower herself down and his cock head went into her. Jenna lowered herself down further on his cock, giving him a hand job and began to ride up and down. She looked over to watch him, smiling and enjoying the feeling of his cock inside of her. She began to move her hips and felt her orgasm start to build.</p> <p>She moaned out loud "Oh God!" She had never climaxed on a cock before and was surprised that even though it had only been a day, this was better than when he had last fucked her.</p> <p>"Oh baby! OH GOD YES!" she yelled out as her orgasm ripped through her. She felt his hips move up against her ass and she knew he was close. As much as she wasn't ready to climax by him getting her off by himself, this felt so good on his cock.
