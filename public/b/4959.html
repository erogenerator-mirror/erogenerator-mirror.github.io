I heard her call me 'cun mummy' and then she was right out the door.</p> <p>When she got to my house, the door was ajar. I tried to push it open quickly before she saw me lying there with her ass in the air. She stopped and I asked her to move my ass.</p> <p>After that, she had her body on top of the door. She said, "My lord, I love you. I will never let any other man in my family."</p> <p>"I know you will never let me in your husband's house, just to see your ass. Then I will be out of your sight for a while, or we will need a few hours. Just say 'I love you'. It will go on for a few hours."</p> <p>"I love you, as well," she said. "But I don't want another baby. I know what a bastard I am and I hate it. It's not fair, if you do not love me."</p> <p>She said, "You know what? I am going, of course. But you don't have to be so mad. You and I both have to be happy. Let us have it."</p> <p>"I am in a hurry," I said.</p> <p>"You're not. I am happy too. And it is just like having that bastard husband of yours out on his knees begging to be let in all other women's asses."</p> <p>I said, "But maybe I should have told you already."</p> <p>"But surely you already let him in my ass in the past. Now you need to do it once."</p> <p>"Do what?" I asked.</p> <p>She thought for a moment and then said, "I can't go any further with you, till I tell you. Tell me and have you think about it. If you say 'no', we will have to end it all. I feel like you are the only one who can go on as though it just happened."</p> <p>"I know," I said.</p> <p>She smiled and said, "I would not be so kind. So after we fuck, we can go home to our husbands and we will have a good weekend. You must understand that I have to tell you everything about it. After that, we can end it."</p> <p>I looked askance at her. "But you must love me. What would you like to do? Would you just go with me there?"</p> <p>"I don't know," she said, "I do care for you. But I just must understand. You really are a darling. I would love to see you happy. Have a good time."</p> <p>And she came into my arms and gave us a warm kiss. I held her and whispered in her ear, "I'm very happy. You do understand that, don't you?"</p> <p>She smiled and hugged me again.</p> <p>I went on talking to her. I said that it is nice not to have a husband like this, so I have decided to use you as a mother.</p> <p>I then asked her, "Do you want to stay with me?"</p> <p>"Why would you ever want me to stay with you?"</p> <p>"Because I think you are much like this mummy. I love you, love those two beautiful babies. I always thought I would get that, when I saw your body once. I will just have to try to find someone who could love both you and the way you love each other."</p> <p>"I think you will have to move out as well as to move in with me, with all the help of my husband. You will have to do it alone."</p> <p>"What? Are you sure, mama?"</p> <p>"Yes, I am sure. I am totally sure of it and I will keep you very happy. I have always told you there is no other way to go."</p> <p>"OK," she said. She walked to the door and went inside.</p> <p>It was then that I realized this was not a bad idea. Her husband could be gone for several days. She was happy. She would be able to take care of herself, as my wife will still have her love for her children to love me. For all I know, we will also have plenty of fun with children togetherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
