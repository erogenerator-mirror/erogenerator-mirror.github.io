He really didn't want to hurt her. Well, at least not at first. Maybe some time. She thought she could feel him behind her again, but it was hard to feel. He rubbed her back and legs, and she felt her arms go around him. He lifted his hands up to cup her breasts again.</p> <p>Then, his body began to press against hers. They both moaned as one, but it came out only a bit out of pleasure and a bit of pain. He began to rock his hips. Hard. He continued to nuzzle her neck as his hands slid up and down her back. She could feel him beginning to harden. He began to kiss her there. His hands were on her naked thighs and back, and one had slid between them to cup her pussy.</p> <p>He was right. Her pussy did feel so good, and so damn good and it felt good to him too! He slid one hand up to cup the back of her head and pull her closer, holding on tightly with the other hand. She could feel his arousal pressing against her, and her pussy felt as wonderful as ever! Her body began to tremble. She began to cry.</p> <p>"Yes!" She moaned, and then felt him start to jerk and cum deep inside her. He continued to kiss her. It was hot, hot, hot. She could feel them as he came. She could smell their musk. They both came. She felt as if his cum was being pressed into her through his dick for ever, filling her up more than anyone ever had.</p> <p>She had never felt anything like it before! It was the deepest, most beautiful sensation. Then she felt his hands begin to move away, and it was as though he had thrown a blanket over them as he began to kiss and lick her as if they were skin and blood. He slid his tongue into her mouth and they were locked into a kiss for some time more. She felt as if she was in a dream of being kissed for ever.</p> <p>After a long while, she began to gently pull him up towards her again. He kissed her again again. She was his now. Her body was alive with pleasure as he held her close, and he would pull her even closer. She had a feeling that the kiss had lasted longer to that moment than the first, but it was enough to get that idea going again. Then they ended up all over each other and they kissed, the kiss of lovers reunited as one in a way that could not be quite as intense.</p> <p>That was about all in one second.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>The next morning, she was up and dressed and had a cup of morning coffee brewed with her favorite fragrances and she was ready to go. "Good morning ladies," she said brightly as she opened the door and smiled her dazzling smile, as she did it. "I thought I might be running the risk of wearing my panties all the way across town, but I have to make sure they're secure! They are in the saddlebag at the momentâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
