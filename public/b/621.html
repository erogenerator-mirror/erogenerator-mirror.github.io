His chest was bare, and she could make out the top of his t-shirt. He stood in front of her, and looked at her over his shoulder. He reached out to place her hand on the bulge in his trousers and she felt a wave of nervousness wash over her again.</p> <p>"Hello, Maggie," he said, extending his hand for her to hand it round. Maggie took it, and shook it nervously. She took it from him, and he placed his hand back into hers. His eyes were deep and warm, he brushed his long finger along the curve of her fingers, and she was shocked at how soft it felt.</p> <p>"You are so lovely, I like that," he said.</p> <p>Her knees went weak, and she could hardly breath. How in the hell had they come to be standing there, kissing each other like that? How had she let this happen?</p> <p>"I think you know," she said, "that we're only going to do this once."</p> <p>He nodded, and he reached out to rest one arm around her shoulders, and she felt him take one hand from her breasts so he could caress the other one. A wave of desire went through her, and she could feel herself getting wet. She wanted him. She wanted to feel him inside her, to feel his hardness, to feel that bulge inside her.</p> <p>She took his hand, and he moved hers up her back, over her throat, and into the hollow of her neck, where he stopped just shy of touching her skin. He felt his fingertips slide over her bare skin as he continued to kiss her slowly. He had one hand round the other, and his thumb was just lightly brushing the outline of her collarbone. She could feel herself trembling ever so slightly, and she felt her clit swell even further inside her jeans.</p> <p>His other hand ran down over her tummy again as he lifted the bottom of her T-shirt, exposing her breasts. He brushed one hand over the underside of one of her small, hardening nipples, and she gasped. She didn't know where that would lead, but she was determined to enjoy it, too, if she could. His hand moved over and slipped inside the side of her thong, feeling her heat as he brushed across her clit. He slipped two fingers under the tight elastic, and pushed his palm against her soft mound. Her legs parted and she could feel how wet she was.</p> <p>He turned her round, bent his head down to her neck, and kissed her. He sucked her neck, and pressed his full lips hard against hers, making two holes for his tongue to probe. She could taste herself as his tongue licked gently on her skin, and his hand worked its way back up her thigh to her mound, and brushed across her clit, making her gasp.</p> <p>As her hand moved on his thigh, he used one finger to caress and rub her clit. He slowly pushed his finger inside her, pulling out almost the whole way before pushing it back against her lips. "You're so wet," he whispered, as he kissed her again.</p> <p>"Take me," she said, a little more urgently, hoping that he would say that again.</p> <p>She felt the weight in his arms as his head moved down her body, his fingers tracing the path of her nipple. His hair brushed the hair of her pussy, sending little jolts straight to her pussy. She arched her back, and felt his mouth cover her breast. She felt his hot breath against her, felt his hot tongue, felt every touch his fingers were giving her, feeling them press harder into her and rubbing her clit as he slowly fucked her with fingers. A finger slipped inside her, and she felt the wetness of it as she spread her legs wider, feeling every inch of her pussy being penetrated. She closed her eyes tightly, and felt him moving his fingers inside her, stroking the walls, feeling her juices run free as he moved them in and out in ever decreasing circles.</p> <p>She knew she was going to come, and with every second she felt an orgasm building up inside her, and started to pant. He knew she was close, too, and pushed both fingers up into her roughly. She cried out, and began to thrash. He felt her muscles tighten around his fingers, the tension inside her build fast, and he pressed harder against her clit. Her thighs clamped around his hand, and she came, hard. He felt her cum, and moved his fingers to stroke her spot as she came down from her high. They held each other, kissing slowly, kissing slowly. He kissed her neck, down her chest, over her tummy, then sucked her nipples into his mouth, making her groan. And she came again, and again, and hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
