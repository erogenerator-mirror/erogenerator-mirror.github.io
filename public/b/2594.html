As soon as the words were out I knew I would. I stood as the girls stepped away, and turned to face me. The way they stepped back and began to walk to me was quite enough to make me smile at what I saw. Their hips swung seductively as they walked, one side of their breasts swaying beautifully in their bikini bottoms, the other swaying erotically to the slow beat of the music.</p> <p>"Now come over to me." I felt my stomach knot at the idea of having this beautiful creature walk with me back to me. And I took it. "Come now."</p> <p>I followed the girls down the hallway, each step the same step I felt my legs shaking. With each step I was getting more and more butterflies in my stomach. By the time we reached where we were, I was very wet, and there wasn't a thing I could do to cover up with my hands so I stepped out into the cool air.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" a voice whispered in the darkness below my ear.</p> <p>"Get on your back." The sound of a voice behind me made it clear the position I was taking in the room was mine. The moment the words left my mouth I knew I had won. There was no turning back now.</p> <p>I felt myself being lifted bodily down the hall and turned around. Hands wrapped around my waist and I watched as they took hold of the bottom of my bikini bottoms and began to pull them down. Before I knew it they had both lifted me up out of them and were holding onto my hips. The fabric of my bikini bottom was pulled so tight that I felt it bunching into a bow right at my clit. "I think someone would be able to see!"</p> <p>I closed my eyes for a second while the sensations of the moment swept through me, all the while not letting my breathing get any faster. I bit my lip as each tug was followed by one of the hands lifting my bikini bottom, and each of their hands squeezing my pussy. For the first time I felt a woman touching me.</p> <p>"No! Oh no, not there!" I tried to push them away so I could get their hands away.</p> <p>"No! Don't worry! Don't try to push me away, no, don't try to move, no!"</p> <p>I felt the lips of the woman on my pussy start to touch me again. The woman started by kissing her way down my stomach, her tongue slipping up the length of me through my shorts. I felt her lips pull down the fabric and it gave way to those beautiful lips. They sucked and teased me into their mouth, sending a deep vibrating sensation all though my body. I moaned involuntarily as the first kiss was broken, and only then did she break it.</p> <p>I felt my legs move wider apart, giving the woman more room to explore. She moved behind me and pulled my head down so I could see her face as it made its way to my pussy. I watched her tongue push inside me and feel it slide over my clit. I felt my nipples harden and push against the sides of my bikini top. I was getting more and more excited as I felt two sets of lips engulf me, one holding my pussy open and the other taking hold of me.</p> <p>I closed my eyes as the tongue plunged over and over into my body. My hips rocked back and forth in time with the tongue, grinding my clit into the lips and the tongue and the woman's.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful," the woman between my legs mumbled.</p> <p>"Come closer," I felt the woman's tongue push harder against my clit. It rubbed up and down.</p> <p>"Mmm! Yes!" My body shook as my orgasm took me to heights I never knew I could reach. I felt the woman's finger on my clit begin to rub me as she worked over my body with her tongue. I bucked my body against the mouth but it was blocked the same time as the woman's finger and her tongue began to push against each other, pushing my body over farther and farther until I felt myself come at the same moment the tongue pushed into me.</p> <p>As I came forward again the tongue lanced in and rubbed against my clit. The lips between my legs began to take over.</p> <p>I came again, and again, my body shaking with the aftershocks. I felt my muscles twitching, trying to try to get some control. It worked, my body shook. And then I heard a voice.</p> <p>"It's me, Jim. It's your sister."</p> <p>It was the voice of Kelly speaking over my mind. It felt like I was in a dream but I did not know whose voice it wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
