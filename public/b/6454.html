"We have just about anything we need."</p> <p>"Just a couple of sandwiches," I said.</p> <p>She didn't even ask me what else I did because I really liked the sandwiches. I knew she could do with a bit of something but at the moment she had to work.</p> <p>"How about a drink?" I asked as we walked into the kitchen.</p> <p>"Sure, I'll get us a couple", she said. "I just wanted to get something to remember, not that that's anything I'll ever need!"</p> <p>"Yeah, sure, but you know your dad has a job so we can relax and catch up later after we eat!" I joked.</p> <p>"Yeah, that sounds cool," she said. She got her sandwich and I poured us both a glass of water and we sat down to eat. We had our bread down and we sipped our water as we talked.</p> <p>"So, you still want to give your mom a massage?" I asked.</p> <p>"Sure, I mean she's in my car but I should probably get back home. You don't mind don't you?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don't know, it's still pretty early, besides I like to be rested," I admitted as I drained my water.</p> <p>"Well, it'll probably be fun," She said with a smile. "But I just want to be able to just relax."</p> <p>"It would be my pleasure", I replied. "I mean...I'd love to do some very relaxing things to you."</p> <p>"I'll be really quiet right now!" She grinned.</p> <p>I didn't say anything and we sat there for a little while longer and then started playing about and playing games. She did have some interesting things to tell me. What I didn't know was how she could tell me something like when your mom is out with her boyfriend in Vegas, when dad has his shower with her when there isn't going to be a fight or anything, and when you and dad go upstairs or up to bed. I had my eye on it as long as she didn't tell me something else. After about an hour passed, mom stopped talking and just smiled and asked me if I was ready. I couldn't believe what had just happened.</p> <p>"Sure! Is he decent?"</p> <p>"He's okay," I assured her. "I think the only thing you need to ask him is 'cause I'm sure I'll be very busy tonight."</p> <p>"Are you sure?" She asked again. "I'll just stop by in a few minutes," she said as she got up and came back over to the table. On the way home she gave me a little kiss on the cheek and then said, "Don't worry, I'll have someone come around and check you out! It's just dinner, I'm sure we can have a great time!"</p> <p>"Sounds great to me," I said with a big smile as she left the table.</p> <p>The rest of the day went pretty quickly and I was feeling pretty good by the time I got home. I still had some things to learn but I didn't expect anything else. It took me until after dark to get out of bed to get my bathrobe and undress. When I finished taking my bath I headed off to get dressed and just finished getting dressed and ready to go in to work. My hands were shaking a bit as I put on my suit.</p> <p>"Hey, can I come in?" I heard my mom call from the kitchen. I smiled at her and said, "Sure, I'm in here!"</p> <p>She looked at me and said, "You're home early...I hope you don't mind."</p> <p>"Not at all," I assured her. "You want to know something before you go?"</p> <p>"Well...um...." I said without thinking. She had asked me to come in and help her in the store and now I wasn't going to be in the store anymore!</p> <p>"Okay," she said and then went directly upstairs. I went back down to the kitchen to turn on a light and I found my wife standing there on my kitchen stoop talking with a tall, redheaded older woman. The woman, who I recognized to have been the sales manager for a local company had no problem standing in the doorway of our house when I arrived home after work. I smiled as my wife approached me and she took my hand.</p> <p>"Hello, honey, you're home early!" She said and then reached for and kissed my cheek. "And there is something you'd like to know" She said. This woman's husband had just had his hands on my mom and one thing led to another and a feelingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
