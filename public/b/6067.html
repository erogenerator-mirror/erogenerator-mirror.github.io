It'll go back to normal at home," he said, holding his stiffened dick with one hand.</p> <p>"But you have something on you. What is that?"</p> <p>"I'm not using protection," he said. "I don't want my wife getting pregnant."</p> <p>"So I can't have another child, but in case you guys need to try it. How long will this take?"</p> <p>"A couple of hours." Brian was ready for work.</p> <p>"How long do you think it'll take?" she asked.</p> <p>"It depends on how it lasts. But we'll be back before nightfall."</p> <p>"Can I ask you a personal question?"</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>"Have you ever cheated on your wife?"</p> <p>"No. I've never cheated on her. When I want to, I'll just tell her that I never wanted to again. That's when it stops."</p> <p>"I don't think her doing it would be cheating. After all, you do have a large dick," she quipped.</p> <p>"I'm just trying to help. I'm sure I can help you figure it out," he said, sitting back down.</p> <p>"You're a big man, but your dick still kind of looks hard."</p> <p>"It's not a big dick, but it's not as hard as the rest of it," he responded.</p> <p>"I'm still going to stick by you," she said, shaking her head. "How long will it take?" she asked, taking his hand and pulling him up.</p> <p>"I'm sure the sooner we get it over with the better we'll all get to know each other better."</p> <p>"Good for me."</p> <p>"You sure you don't want to continue your little adventure around here?" she asked, as they sat down.</p> <p>"It will be more fun if we were in the nude," he said.</p> <p>"If we were in the hotel room without a bathing suit on, then we'd be naked."</p> <p>"I'm sure it will be worth it. Let's go to bed and make a night of it. You have your hand in the middle of the bed," he said.</p> <p>"Don't talk to me," she warned, sitting up on her tiptoes and kissing him on the lips.</p> <p>"I just wanted to hold you and cuddly you in bed," he said. "Then do the thing that you're planning to do tomorrow."</p> <p>"What that thing is?"</p> <p>"It's called the '69'. It's one of our little getaways," he explained, laying down on his back again.</p> <p>She looked at him and smiled.</p> <p>"I have a little surprise for you tomorrow."</p> <p>"You've got it," Brian said.</p> <p>"I never thought you'd be open to doing the things that we're going to do for each other," she said seriously.</p> <p>"I'm not your master," he said quickly. "I'm just your friend."</p> <p>"Do you promise to not break up your marriage any further?" she whispered, staring down at his cock, which had remained flaccid in her hands.</p> <p>"I promise, I'm not going to break up what we have."</p> <p>"We're not just friends, are we?" she whispered again.</p> <p>"No. It just seemed so much like we were meant to be," he replied, still looking into her eyes, but seeing a look she couldn't read.</p> <p>"I thought we were together?" she asked.</p> <p>"I know. Even though we were married for a few years," he answered, lying back down on his back again, making room for her on top.</p> <p>"You should have known that I would say no to this," she quipped.</p> <p>"Of course I didn't know that," he replied, looking into her eyes again.</p> <p>She moved down and lay on her side next to him, sitting on his chest.</p> <p>"What were you thinking?" she asked, sitting on his stomach.</p> <p>"If you said no, what would you think about letting me come on to you?" he replied, pulling her tight against him.</p> <p>"It'll never happen," she said.</p> <p>"It would be fun to let us have fun together.
