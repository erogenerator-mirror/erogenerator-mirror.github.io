I closed and locked the door behind us. After locking the door there, we walked upstairs to my bed. I pushed her down on the bed and laid on top of her. She could feel my lips on hers as I took a hold of her hands and bound them to the headboard. I had already taken hold of her tits with one leg and then I removed her other leg. She was very uncomfortable but I ignored it and just kissed her. Our arms were being secured to the bottom of the bed with one of the ties so she had no access of my arms.</p> <p>I knelt there above her as I kissed her and then I started to suck and nibble her nipples which caused her to moan in pleasuring pleasure. I kissed along her neck and then down to her chest where I kissed and sucked one of her nipples and then her other.</p> <p>Her body had been built for sex and now she was being pleasured like never before; she loved the attention she had received.</p> <p>I ran my hand down her chest to her waiting pussy and started to tease her lips with my finger.</p> <p>"Don't make me wait much longer."</p> <p>I slowly pushed my finger inside her and felt her hips raise as I moved it in and out a bit.</p> <p>"Oh yes, yes, I love you."</p> <p>I continued to work on her pussy as I kissed her throat and nibbled her earlobe which caused her to shudder on my finger. As she started to lose control, I could feel her pussy tightening and I quickly inserted a second finger in her which made her come with a loud moan. I kept playing with her as her juices began to flow. After making sure the sheets of my bed were soaked with her juices, I removed my fingers and laid next to her on my bed. Once her breathing returned to a more normal level, I was on my side and between her legs which were now spread wide allowing me easy access to her pussy which I started to lick. It caused her to orgasm again and again. I was licking her pussy, sucking on her lips, and moving my fingers all around her pussy.</p> <p>My arm was under her and her leg was up and pulled up. I kissed her thighs and started to kiss her ass. I lapped her pussy as I got her started to come again and again.</p> <p>I could feel her body tighten around me as the tension was coming to a crescendo.</p> <p>Her legs were still tightly clinched around mine as I felt her orgasm beginning to intensify. She released her hold on her hold on me.</p> <p>"Oh yes." My body went into over drive as she started to come again.</p> <p>She moaned in pleasure as her body was completely filled with passion.</p> <p>She laid on my bed feeling very sexy and comfortable as she regained control of herself.</p> <p>She removed her body from mine and looked at me.</p> <p>"I want to spend some time with you."</p> <p>She got up and started to brush the hair that had fallen across my forehead, then she turned and walked to the door in search of her clothes.</p> <p>The next morning in bed with her, we made love and in the morning I felt her body wrapped around me as her eyes stared into mine with an expression of adoration. I was feeling the same. We had had many many wonderful nights of sex together but the sex we had the first night was just one of those that I had enjoyed the most. We both loved our sex life and she felt the same way. I also loved the view she had of my body after last night. Her eyes held the same admiring gaze as I felt the same way. We both needed to change a bit of our routine to be more comfortable.</p> <p>I held her hand a while feeling how happy she was. She smiled, kissed my hand and stood from the bed.</p> <p>"We had a good time last night!"</p> <p>"Yes. I could not have predicted that we would make love before last night!"</p> <p>"You were very good to me last night."</p> <p>"I felt very good so I wanted to do it again."</p> <p>"I want us to do it again every year."</p> <p>"I like that!"</p> <p>She came to me and held me close as I felt that a big time yearning to hug her tightly.</p> <p>"Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
