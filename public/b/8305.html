After several minutes he turned his chair so that he could place his cock between my legs and then started rubbing my clit. He worked two fingers inside me from above and I nearly came on his fingers - but I held back. I couldn't believe how much my body wanted his cock inside and how hard I was trying to hold back - I wanted him to fill me with his hot cum as he pumped into me.</p> <p>I couldn't stand it any longer. I pulled his hand to me, kissed him passionately, and told him I wanted him inside me NOW.</p> <p>He turned his chair so we were facing away from the desk. He pressed himself against me from behind, lifted one of my legs onto his shoulder, and entered me. I felt him swell up inside me, pushing into my cervix, and began to move in rhythm with his thrusts - pushing against him to force him back deeper into me. I was amazed by how excited my body seemed to be having this effect on this man and how much pleasure I was feeling - even if it didn't make me cum on his cock.</p> <p>His hands were playing with my tits, and my nipples were rock hard, and he began to pound into me harder, faster. The bed began vibrating from our new rhythm, the sound muffled enough, for me to hear. The sensation wasn't pain by any fucking standards - but it was just so sensual. I began to feel a warmth spreading from my vagina as my clit seemed to be being rubbed in a circular fashion, the feelings making me so happy. My hips began to meet him as he fucked me like a woman possessed.</p> <p>"Oh - oh - ohhhh - ohhhh - Ohhhhhhhhh," all the time I was trying to keep my climax in a secret spot that couldn't be seen.</p> <p>In a daze, I could tell that he was close also. As he began to thrust harder into me, I could also feel the familiar feeling of his cum building inside him. As his breathing became ragged, and I could feel our skin separating as I opened my mind to his cum, I could hear his moans. He seemed to be grunting, which I believed was what caused me to let him cum inside me. I could feel it oozing out from my vagina where it slid on my ass and onto his balls as it bounced up and down. Our motions were making each other higher and higher as we neared our climaxes.</p> <p>I could tell that the head of his cock began turning purple as he began to explode. As he pulled out of me I could feel it pulsing against my insides, and when it was done, he wrapped his muscular arms around me and kissed me deeply and deeply. I could taste his cum on his lips as we began to disengage. I could smell him on me, and feel his cum as it flowed over my breasts and neck.</p> <p>I was sitting on the side of the bed, just like I had been when he came in, when I felt him lift me into his arms and hold me close. I knew I must have slept because I could hear him tell me how wonderful we had made each other's body - telling me how good it felt in my arms and how much he truly loved and wanted us to look back at one another and wonder what it has becomeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
