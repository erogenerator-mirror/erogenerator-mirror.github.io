"Do you like it? Do you want me to continue eating?"</p> <p>I gave her the answer she was looking for. "Yes, I like it. Eat me. Eat me."</p> <p>Then she got the next best thing. "Will you cum when I do?"</p> <p>"Oh, God, yes. I want you to cum with me."</p> <p>She smiled. "That reminds me. I can't have kids; I have only been fertile before," she teased. "Can I have you now?"</p> <p>I nodded my agreement. "I'd like to be your mother-in-law, to be your wife. I want to carry a baby and make love to you while you eat me."</p> <p>"You've got me. I'd like that." She moved onto the floor and got on her back. "Get that thing hard." Slowly, I positioned myself between her legs. She held my cock with one hand and started to stroke me with her other. Her pussy was warm and wet. She spread her legs wide. "Come right in," she breathed. Slowly I worked the head of my dick into myself. I was about halfway in when she started to moan and thrust against me. Suddenly, I was all in and she said, "Oh, God, do it. Do it."</p> <p>I started to pound into her. Slow, shallow, long strokes. Her body went rigid. She wrapped her arms around me and pulled me close. As soon as I felt the muscles of her pussy tense and relax, I felt my cock flex and pulse. She held me tightly and her body went rigid with spasms. My climax was strong and hard. In a very short time, my dick exploded.</p> <p>In the afterglow, I lay there catching my breath and thinking about how much I had loved and wanted what we just did. I knew I loved the woman and not the two of them, but in that moment, I still enjoyed her, wanted to feel her in every way. I couldn't wait to see her naked and loving me. I couldn't wait to see her naked and loving me. I was sure I'd be seeing everything of her.</p> <p>We slept. The next morning, I went to my shower and she came to me. She had changed into a robe and went out. She had an overnight bag with her, that I now use as a dressing room. She returned about an hour later, wearing a short terry robe. Both were nude, but I had my robe just above her hips. Her hair was in its braid; I could see her bare shoulders and upper chest. Our mouths and tongues and my heart were pounding. We kissed, and then she took my hand and led me to the bed, where I fell asleep very quickly.</p> <p>The next Monday, on Wednesday, I went to a conference in Orlando, which I had to attend on Friday. I was there for about a half hour and it was my second meeting of the day. I was with a very important client and after a brief break, we made the next arrangements. The next trip to Orlando would be a full day's work, and, if possible, to the best sex in someplace, since the conference we had had. The client was a man, but I could see that he was a very happy-go-lucky man. I also made a list of things to do, so that could all come into play. Finally, I got back to my hotel for that day and checked out.</p> <p>For the next few days, I would go to work, attend my meeting and do all my work. I got a lot of work done that night, which I will go back to Sunday. On Friday, I went to the conference, which was on Monday and got to meet a lot of people. This was different, I was spending more time on Tuesday and Thursday of the week, rather than weekends or weekends. I went home to the house and went back to my apartment. I had the whole weekend to change from the weekend into the next week. By the time I was able to get back, I had changed from Friday to the evening and Saturday, which might seem strange. When I walked back to the apartment, my first thought was to call her, but had put in for a phone. If it turned out to be a date with her, I was going to make love to her in that hotel before going home.</p> <p>On Saturday, I went to the business meeting. It took less than one hour, and by seven, the client and his wife were going to be able to go anywhere in the building without being embarrassed about my work and getting caught. We made the dinner reservations together. We had a good time in the hotel bar, and made two or three trips there, when we were all alone. It was a good time. I made reservations to meet a coupleâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
