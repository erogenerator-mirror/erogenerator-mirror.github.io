There was plenty of time for me to take things into my own hands and just do it; I'd decided that it was time to move on. Maybe I could get this marriage to come around, and if she really needed it.</p> <p>But if it took time I really didn't know how, and I'd get another chance to get away with it before I gave in to anything stupid.</p> <p>It wasn't so easy. The longer I was home, the more time I spent at home with the kids than at any other job. My friends always joked at how I'd spend all my weekends getting nothing done. I guess it just came back to me.</p> <p>I got home early enough that I'd probably have enough time to grab a quickie when I'd finally got home and get in my room before my daughter's old friend Julie arrived. I hadn't seen Julie since that fateful day at the park in October, and I guessed she'd be home until late at night.</p> <p>A quickie? What's a girl to do? She'll be over with her friends and then we'll all be alone in the family room with the TV on.</p> <p>I was dressed in jeans and a T-shirt and a baseball cap when I walked in the front door. Julie had her legs tucked up under her and the baseball hat she usually put on top of her head was on.</p> <p>Julie's mother, Amanda was already outside. Amanda was an attractive, brunette with a great set of c-cup breasts she always complained that women didn't like in a woman, but that seemed true when she noticed that I was home. Julie had just turned around towards me and I just about jumped her just when she opened the door.</p> <p>"Hey, Daddy!" Julie grinned, extending her hand in greeting as we sat down at the kitchen table.</p> <p>"Hi Julie." I shook her hand and Amanda stood up and hugged me.</p> <p>"Well, I've told you before I'm not home all night, but I've got two bags here. How 'bout we go get you something to eat?"</p> <p>"I don't cook."</p> <p>"Don't you know that's not something your mother does?" Julie smiled, and then hugged me again, this time kissing her on the cheek softly.</p> <p>"I sure wouldn't give all of that up." Amanda grinned, then took a bite of her chicken in one bite. "You're not the only one I know who works down there."</p> <p>"Yeah," I grinned. "But it's the only cookin' I know."</p> <p>Amanda giggled her approval and I followed her towards the kitchen, and then Julie pulled me out of the refrigerator and into the kitchen.</p> <p>"Can I get you something?" Julie handed me a small bowl of soup and filled her basket filled dish.</p> <p>"It's okay. We've got plenty," I said, and then quickly added "Besides, I'm not all that hungry myself."</p> <p>Then I looked over at Julie, who stood by the stove waiting for me to finish cooking. She and Julie had stopped talking as they'd finished their meal, but Amanda was standing close to us.</p> <p>"Hey, is that coffee?" she asked.</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Sorry. It was a bit chilly." She walked over to me and kissed me on the cheek. "I was just checking to see what time you had left in your fridge."</p> <p>"Oh, okay." I set the dishes down. "What're you doing home so early?"</p> <p>"I had to, but I'm at work. It's actually around a park to pick up something for dinner to go out there with my girlfriend today, and I thought I'd go to the park early this afternoon."</p> <p>"Are you okay with staying there today, Daddy?"</p> <p>"Sure. I don't know what I'd say, though. It seems like it's really cool to come home early, so I figured I'd just go with what little sense I got about it."</p> <p>"Okay Daddy," Julie said. "It makes it easier to take me to bed so early. I'm exhausted, but I'll be okay."</p> <p>"Are you hungry?" Julie asked.</p> <p>"Uh...yeah."</p> <p>"Can you make a run to your room so I can get a change of clothes? I'll leave the door open to let the breeze in. I don't want you to catch anything, though."</p> <p>"Sure..." I smiled.</p> <p>Julie took one of Julie's hands, and Amanda's out for mine, and they ran off to my room while I put the final touches on the dinner and put my phone toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
