It was a beautiful day, crisp in the evening, the sun shining through the trees like a jewel-red ball of gold, reflecting off the water. The sound of the wind carried the scent of the sea.</p> <p>At the first sign of the day's end, they all headed up to their rooms. John and John's mother would have wanted to take her away for an early day swim, but the younger generation had been there for the day and it was nice to return to their own rooms. It wasn't just about their love. As the sun set, all three girls left to go to the water, leaving the older children alone in their rooms for a relaxing walk.</p> <p>Candy arrived shortly before sunset. She was wearing a short white shirt and short pleated skirt, while John's friends looked on in stunned disbelief. They each looked out from the window admiring the warm and sunny view of the ocean, and were amazed that the night seemed so perfect. Candy was as beautiful as everyone else around her, and could be considered stunning in her natural beauty. "It's perfect," they said as they all complimented her on her look.</p> <p>The two young women looked into each others eyes as they exited the house. "I don't think we'll miss the show," she said with a smile.</p> <p>John's mother was also at the window with a smile of her own. She had dressed quite formally this time, in a very short skirt, and a halter top, which barely had enough top to cover her ample breasts. Her skin tone was an unmistakable, light olive. She was wearing her hair in a ponytail, and John's Mom could clearly see the silver ring through her left strap as her head fell back to look down her pale neck in profile. The halters and shirt accentuated her long neck beautifully.</p> <p>The two girls walked casually to their dorm, all of them enjoying the feeling of freedom that came with going to their dorm in a beautiful hotel. When they arrived, Candy said goodbye to her friend as she handed her a key to their suite. John's mother shook her head and said, "It's getting late. We should be going now."</p> <p>Candy's heart raced as she stepped outside out of the front door. "Oh, I wish we had a place to play!" she gushed.</p> <p>A large hand extended towards her, and John's mother stepped forward. John's mother's hand wrapped around Candy from the outside, and lifted her to stand. "We should have done this sooner," John's mother said as she helped Candy stand.</p> <p>Everyone stared as they held each other close. The last time they hugged was the night of the swim, and the first time they kissed after John's mother had helped him out of the pool. The girls had felt much better when they hugged John's mother and then their mother's. "I'm really ready," they both said in a hushed tone.</p> <p>John's mother spoke up, "I'm going out to the ocean to do a little exploring; I'll be back some time to check out all the little shops we found tonight. Let's go." Her voice was serious as she led Candy to the house and towards the front door.</p> <p>The girls entered the front door naked, and were soon escorted to their room. Candy's eyes were closed as she put her right hand on her large belly and slowly drew nearer her soft lips. When her tongue touched the tip of her tongue, her body shuddered. They heard the water run as the couple stood in front of each window, gazing out from behind the big glass doors. They had taken in the view over the ocean and were now gazing down at a beautiful nude woman who was naked from the waist up but had her legs splayed apart so they could see all of her body.</p> <p>John's Mom's voice took on an edge to her voice, "Is this just a friendly gesture?" When she took on that same tone, the girls heard her tone in her voice almost as if she were addressing an old familiar phrase. Their hands fell to their sides, knowing that they were both standing there by their own rules regarding their sex life. That voice of hers was not something they would ever speak. They looked at each other to see if it was even their business.</p> <p>Candy giggled from being close to the open air, and spoke up. "It's nice to meet you, Mom."</p> <p>John's mother smiled and patted her on the shoulder to reassure her, "It's no secret you're both beautiful too. I was surprised when they arrived, but they both enjoyed it. I'm surprised they aren't naked." She paused for a moment, then responded in a voice which was hushed and playful. "You might be surprised at the effect those two have on your young bodiesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
