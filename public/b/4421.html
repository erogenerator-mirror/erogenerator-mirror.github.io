Jessica asked.</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>Jessica turned to look at John and said, "Are you going to tell me how this ends?"</p> <p>"I don't want to have to tell you my plan for tonight."</p> <p>Jessica smiled with a little smile and hugged John. He had heard of this club before, of course, and this one was not very fancy or even remotely close to where Jessica lived. A girl from the scene called Jessica, they were friends from college; I had met her after classes, and she came here to meet some new people. I had also heard about her, it was a party, with the theme to see if the club was a real place.</p> <p>"I know what that means," Jessica said. "I'm a guy then. I want to get laid, but there are other guys here, they aren't as good as me, I can always work with them."</p> <p>Jessica and her boyfriend talked for a while, mostly about getting laid, but also about her parents and the party. That led to her and John, and then to some of her parents fucking in her room while she was drunk from all those drugs.</p> <p>"I'm not interested in her right now," she added.</p> <p>"You're more than just a girl. I wouldn't mind a date with you."</p> <p>"I don't think it's any of your business."</p> <p>"I know you would. I'm not asking for what you think, just so you know."</p> <p>Jessica smiled; she really thought John would be interested in a girl from her work. He would be interested in a girl from her job, too, he really liked Jessica. She thought so too, she liked being with John; he did not seem to mind her sucking on him at all. Jessica knew John very well. He was good looking and had really nice hands.</p> <p>"I'm not the guy you want to have a long, complicated conversation about." John turned to look at Jessica.</p> <p>"What I do for fun is who I'm with, because you're a young girl. There are not many of them in the industry, you are the exception."</p> <p>A pause; Jessica paused again.</p> <p>"Oh."</p> <p>Jessica laughed; she felt like she had just been a child again. She really liked John. She was pretty sure in the world of hookers, she could never get enough.</p> <p>"So what do you think of those guys that work for you?" Jessica asked.</p> <p>"Well, they are great."</p> <p>Jessica paused.</p> <p>"I'm not a party girl, but they still turn me on," she added. "I'm not as easy about it as you do about being with you." She giggled again.</p> <p>"That's true, I'm not. It's true what other men think, not all the guys are going to come on to you."</p> <p>Jessica laughed and said, "Well, at first, I liked it. I liked the attention. And then I had a boyfriend, and I liked how they looked at me."</p> <p>"What a surprise. Did you ever think about the guys?"</p> <p>"Oh, no. I never thought about them," Jessica said. "I guess I was the only one that got caught up in all the excitement; the sex was great. But, I know about guys."</p> <p>John was trying but not hard to think about all the different ways that Jessica might have enjoyed sex a few women did with guys. The only reason she did it was because she liked to do it, so he had always wanted to come to see her, but he was too far behind his girl. She was not his girl.</p> <p>"But," John continued, "I would like to experience some more, too. I think I would love to be inside you."</p> <p>"That's a good idea, John." Jessica agreed. "You're really a great guy; you don't need to be attached to me to be with you."</p> <p>Jessica and John had been dating for a month. There were a lot of girls in the industry, but as they both told Jessica before, there were a lot of losers in the industry. John could understand that, Jessica and Jessica never bothered to get married. They loved each other a lot but in the workplace, everyone was so jealous.</p> <p>Now Jessica and John were together forever. John was her first. The night before she had called Jessica over in their apartment, so Jessica could tell her boyfriend, they had been fucking in his apartment. Jessica had thought it was something she wanted to do, to make him jealous, and to make him feel great about it. But as they hung out, they were never really together as much as John had been.</p> <p>A good number of dates that they had had sex had beenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
