"And take off my shoes!"</p> <p>With that I lifted my head up and took a quick look at the foot traffic, trying to get a quick picture of where they were, but I couldn't keep the camera in my head, and I tried to keep the memory out of my head, but a quick look told me they were headed back. My jaw just hung, my legs slightly parted, my mouth and throat dry, as I followed them back down the street.</p> <p>"Oh gosh," I said under my breath as I caught a glimpse, though there was nowhere to look I'm sure - the ground around us just barely carried as I watched the two women on their bicycles walk. "I've never seen anything like this," I finally told myself. There was no way I could leave this place, let alone back home, for any future memory of this place. The memory of this spot - it was perfect - it was a perfect place for me to stay, just at our own pace.</p> <p>"Oh! Yes!" she said, looking back at me over her shoulder. "Are you ready yet?"</p> <p>"Definitely, I think," I said, letting my mouth hang open for a moment as I tried to catch my breath. "You're really something, aren't you?" I asked her.</p> <p>"It's just a question," came her reply, but I could see the amusement in her eyes, "or is there?"</p> <p>"You could be just what I've got at home," I replied, thinking of how much "just what" I had at home was enough, if the memory wouldn't take my mind off things.</p> <p>"Good enough," she said, and she turned around and said "See you later".</p> <p>She had stopped beside a car, and as I turned around, she leaned down and whispered softly "and now you can take that tongue in all the way."</p> <p>I did as she asked, following her into the car, listening to her talk to a friend about how much she loved to tease me; what it would be like to see her get into the rear of some car, and how much she liked to tease me mercilessly.</p> <p>We drove on to the local park, stopping a few times to catch a few minutes of the countryside along the way to make sure we got clear; a nice day, but one that we both had a lot of. The park was empty, though, the trees there looking pretty dammed out from the road. Even the parking lot was clean, as we had not encountered any cars.</p> <p>I decided to go along with her, and followed her directions. I watched her, still in my own pants, as we followed the path around the edge of the park, getting closer to the entrance to this place she had described. I noticed the people walking along the benches, all looking at us, even though we just passed the picnic hamper. As I watched, she stepped up a little, her eyes locked on mine, and her head bobbed ever so slightly in the opposite directions as she smiled.</p> <p>We parked a block down and walked around the corner, turning around for just a minute. She looked back at us in the mirror, still holding tightly to the hem of her hoodie, and as one of her legs crossed a bit, exposing a bit of flesh between her legs, a look in her eye told me she was getting a bit excited. My cock, which seemed only about an inch longer than her, had been aching since that brief flash between the legs of my wife, and yet still I could feel it throb in my pants as I moved over to her. There were other people in the park, in fact...</p> <p>The path led directly towards the path that circled the park, and the path that circled the path behind gave it complete privacy. I had been walking around the perimeter without even thinking, and I could see she would stop occasionally so that she could look around. We found a clearing, in the middle of which stood a large picnic table with a large bench seat on both ends. A few yards down on either side I could see an outdoor door set into the wall, with some sort of curtain, and a window to the next door that looked out onto the path that followed our direction as we came around to the back of the picnic table.</p> <p>I noticed her watching us, as she stood with her eyes locked on mine, and her cheeks reddening with the blush. "It must be nice to be recognized by another person?" she asked. "I like it when people watch."</p> <p>"Well, if you liked that, maybe we should stop for something to eat. The sun looks to be having a good time.
