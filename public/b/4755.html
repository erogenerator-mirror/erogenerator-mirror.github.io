She didn't need him to tell her that he loved her. She loved him. Now it was their time. It was time for her to be a woman. This wasn't about a one-night stand, this was a full-time relationship. They couldn't be without each other. Maybe that's what she told herself. But it's so hard to make decisions when you're so scared that you just have to be there for the next week.</p> <p>"It was good, but he didn't get me pregnant. It's because of what we did that I wanted to get his baby. I couldn't make our time together worth anything. I think about him every day. I really think about him from the first time I met him. Like some of the kids in my life when I turned eighteen. I was his first date. He was the first in the world to kiss me. He kissed me everywhere. He kissed me between my legs. He was a virgin. Our first time didn't go anywhere." "I guess we should have taken time out from dating," she thought to her self. "My life before you is going to be a blur and I should have remembered that."</p> <p>"I'm really happy for you."</p> <p>She reached over and took his hand. "You are such a big help. Thank you for everything your wife's been doing on our day off. You're right about her and your sister are nice. Now, can she make us breakfast. I'm starving."</p> <p>He smiled. "Thank you again, but I wouldn't do anything to make you feel bad. Here's a piece of bacon and some cereal, and let's go to a nice restaurant."</p> <p>"Oh good. This is it." And then, "Thank you, that's very kind."</p> <p>"I think we're on our third year together," she smiled. "I've had no more time to make plans about what I'm going to do next year's wedding. I'm sorry."</p> <p>"It was nothing. I was just happy to be with you." He took her hand in his. "I'm truly sorry for trying to steal your marriage away from her."</p> <p>She smiled at him. "I wish someone would have told me sooner," she giggled and they held hands as they walked to the car. It was late morning now. He told her to make her date at a public place. She told him she wanted to meet some of the people from the firm. Her face fell.</p> <p>"Oh! You mean to tell me you don't get married?" she asked with more than a little fear.</p> <p>"No, no," he said. "My wife doesn't have her rings on."</p> <p>"Why not?" She asked him, feeling a little insulted.</p> <p>"Well, it's not me or your husband that you're so attracted to," he said. "I just happen to like to drive cars while you're driving. He doesn't have that problem."</p> <p>She giggled. A part of her was flattered. The other part was disappointed.</p> <p>"I feel bad, like cheating on my husband," she said.</p> <p>"I know that, sweetie. It will be okay, I promise. Besides, I know you won't cheat on your hubby unless that's what you want. Besides, what is it you want to do today?"</p> <p>"I've got to do the morning thing. I promised my sister that my sister would be going to the doctor about noon to take my birth control pill today. If you want to go shopping with me, I would really appreciate it if you could get me some lunch. Can you do something to help me get home today?" she asked.</p> <p>"Sure. Let's go to a nice restaurant." He took her hand again and led her over to a nice quiet restaurant. It had nice, nice music playing.</p> <p>"I'm hungry too," she said. It made everything so much more special.</p> <p>"Let's see if we can make you something for supper," he said and led her to his office.</p> <p>They entered his office and walked in. She was seated in his large easy chair facing him, facing him where anyone could walk down the hallway. They both watched her dress as he sat in a chair. It didn't take long to get her to the restaurant by herself. But the other employees were on a break. The main purpose was to get some lunch and then to take a walk to the store to buy something.</p> <p>"I'd like you to join me for lunch," he said and smiled when she smiled.</p> <p>He knew she would go along with.
