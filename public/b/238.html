"I guess I never really got to like 'im anymore." Her lips moved from my lips to my chin, and she took my face in her hands and gave me that long, sweet, lingering look. When we finally made it across the room, we kissed and I lifted my hands to fondle her breasts while they were trapped against her chest and it felt so erotic, so sexy.</p> <p>I felt as though I might spontaneously combust at any time but my penis had gotten harder and harder in her hands, I couldn't have been harder in a dream. She seemed to really understand that it was time to remove her gown as well, so I slid my fingers inside her bra cups and finally removed them altogether, and we were lying together with her on the king-sized bed. I turned to face her, and we kissed again. I was kissing my way down her torso while gently rubbing her naked breasts and slowly unbuttoning her shirt.</p> <p>While I was doing it, I moved behind her, and she took the opportunity to turn over, allowing me access to her body that I could never have imagined. Her breasts were just as beautiful as I remembered, and they were very firm and warm to the touch. I reached around her to cup her breasts completely and squeeze them as I felt the fullness there as well. I began taking my time, exploring her curves with a growing excitement. I loved looking at her smooth skin up close, especially on her breasts. They were absolutely the perfect size, and as I slowly slid one hand to her stomach, which was still hairless, my fingers started following her curves, from beneath her waist to around her navel and along her upper chest, making small circular moves with my fingers, slowly moving down toward her breasts.</p> <p>I loved the feel of her soft skin under my fingers, and I imagined it was as smooth as an Egyptian's body...and she had really grown in the very short time I had been down there...and that turned me on even more. I moved downward to her hips, which she had apparently finished waxing; the result was still incredibly soft looking. I looked up at her, and there it was, a lovely scar left by her boyfriend who had accidentally kissed it... and it glowed so brightly and she still had her hair like it had never been! At that moment, I wanted to give it so much love. I'd have to have it to be hers.</p> <p>I moved my lips closer to her ear and began making small nibbling sounds of appreciation; I wondered what it would feel like to have something so soft between us and how she might react when I put my lips on that very spot. I kissed all around her ear, and I felt it becoming wet with my saliva as I gently kissed it. Slowly, I inched a path down her neck to her collarbone. I had never been particularly into my job at it, but I had learned that when I went to the bathroom to wash my hands after, they weren't as wet as they normally were. I moved back down her upper chest to her breasts and began making slow circles around them while I took my time on her nipples. I could just barely see in front of me, and then it was all up against my face while she had removed my shirt. I enjoyed the view. I felt the wetness as it ran down over my face and down my chin; I couldn't resist any longer, and slid a hand up to stroke the side of her breast and play with her nipple. I rolled my fingers around the nipple, which became rock hard in my grip.</p> <p>I moved my mouth down to the tops of her breasts so I could nibble them all over; I even bit her some, not in particularly, but just a little in the way that could be considered kissing. I alternated between them for just a little bit before stopping so I could look up at her and make sure my eyes were indeed able to see what was going on in front of me. Her hair was wild; her face was flushed, even though no one could really see in anyway. I wanted to kiss it, but I knew that was better than getting it in the wrong order.</p> <p>I slid my head slowly back up to her breasts and kissed and sucked her nipples while gently stroking her upper chest. I moved down so that I could make small circular motions over her breasts and even into her abdomen, which was covered by a very light golden bush. She was becoming more and more wet by the second, as she let her hands lay flat down upon the mattress and I had to keep on reaching up to support myself. I did everything else I could, from lightly tracing her navel to kissing her sides and slowly moving back up again to her stomach. I was sure she must have comeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
