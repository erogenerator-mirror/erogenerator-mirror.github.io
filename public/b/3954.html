"You know I have never said that before."</p> <p>"I would never say it to you when you were in school. I just don't want to hear what you have to say and then think."</p> <p>"Can you imagine if you had said that to me."</p> <p>Sam started to speak but thought better of it. "So I can promise I won't. I still love you."</p> <p>"You have no idea."</p> <p>"That's because the world hasn't just changed around us. It's changed the world."</p> <p>"I love you, too."</p> <p>Sam looked up and back at me and then lowered her eyes and asked, "What were you thinking about?"</p> <p>"Nothing."</p> <p>Sam looked up and said, "I just realized how much I am falling down."</p> <p>"Is that it?"</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Because it's true."</p> <p>Sam was silent. I wondered what could be wrong? I asked, "So what do you mean?" Sam said, "I mean I have never said that."</p> <p>"That's because you never would."</p> <p>Sam looked at herself in the dressing mirror and I could see that she was turning red. "It's okay. I know it's not okay so why shouldn't I understand?"</p> <p>I looked at Sam and said, "I understand. It's nothing that can't stay between us. It's not love or any other emotion or feeling other than what we already know, and if the feelings are good you can have them. It's just that..." Sam looked at me and asked, "Is it love, Sam?"</p> <p>"I guess..."</p> <p>"Is love? That's love, Sam. I mean, it's something both of us will always be thankful for. It's a human connection and it's not hard to feel or understand and that's what I'd like. So yes, it's definitely love."</p> <p>"Sam, I can't tell you how much I'm falling down."</p> <p>"What is you lying about then?"</p> <p>"Are you having an affair?"</p> <p>Sam looked at me with the kind of shock you get when you don't think straight. "No. Why would I lie?"</p> <p>"You don't have to lie; I have no proof, and I'm willing to trust you."</p> <p>"How much do you trust me as a friend?"</p> <p>"You know what I mean."</p> <p>The silence stretched on and on again. Finally, Sam spoke, "You don't always have to tell me what I'm thinking."</p> <p>Sam leaned back and looked at the floor and said, "When I saw your face in class yesterday I felt very strongly about you. I mean, we never did get into any serious talk about love."</p> <p>"But that was a long time ago. I'm not sure I've ever said that to a person before."</p> <p>I was quiet and silent for a few seconds. I didn't want to be a burden or do anything else but to be honest I just didn't know where to start. I just knew I had to tell her about her cheating first. With that in mind, I told Sam, "You told me that you really loved me the minute I walked into your class. And you have for several days now. So let's start by talking about how much you love me."</p> <p>The silence passed into an uncomfortable silence. Sam was staring at me but didn't move. I waited.</p> <p>Sam said, "Are you listening?"</p> <p>"I am listening, and if you want to stop talking right now and come and get the phone or something before you leave, be careful, Sam. It will drive your mind somewhere else."</p> <p>"I'm not afraid of having sex," she said. "I love you and I do love my husband and he loves me."</p> <p>"Sam, that isn't the point, is it?"</p> <p>"Now, don't give it back to me."</p> <p>I didn't want to say anything until she got back to her seat. I waited for her before she reached for the phone and dialed. When there was nothing on the answering machine and neither of us heard Sam's voice on the other end, Sam said, "Hello?"</p> <p>Sam's voice rang and then I heard the voice of someone else on the other end. My heart nearly stopped pumping. I didn't know how I felt but I couldn't let Samâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
