You turn to face me. I watch you in the mirror as it slides sideways and down. I feel the top of your thigh brush against my hard-on, and I reach down to rub it through your skirt. You lean forward a little.</p> <p>“How tall are you?” I ask.</p> <p>All the way over to you, I can hear you say, “about eleven”, your skirt riding up again.</p> <p>“Ohhh!” I say. And, in my ear, I reach under.</p> <p>I can feel your legs rub against mine and your skirt ride up a little more. My fingers start to slide around, around and around inside you. I find it as moist as your panties.</p> <p>I look up just as my fingers slide over the front of your panties and down.</p> <p>Your hips twitch and shift. The front of your skirt rides up a bit more, the curve of your nipples pushing against your t-shirt. I continue slowly massaging you with my fingertips as I hear you moan softly. I can hear your breathing quickening. I can tell you are getting closer again, but this time with two hands, the same fingers on your clit. I can see your breathing become shorter and more rapid. I continue rubbing you and moving my hands up over your body. I could almost taste your desire as your hips push against me.</p> <p>My fingers were making a big impression on you. Your hips press against me. I could see that you were trembling slightly. It makes the fabric of your clothes feel extra warm and shiny in my hands. You are breathing harder now. I feel a slight burning sensation as the sweat beads on the tips of your breasts.</p> <p>Your nipples rise out a little over your shirt on the right side. I can smell the faint but wonderful scent of your perfume. Your eyes are close now.</p> <p>We move together again, our thighs rubbing and slipping together. The feel of your wetness on my fingers makes me so fucking hot! The feel of your nipples against my palms as I rub up and down the sides of you is so sweet.</p> <p>I stop for a moment to gather your hair out of your hair into my hand. I can see your face looking directly into my eyes.</p> <p>“I want you to do as I tell you,” you say. I feel your hips pushing against mine, but I don’t remove myself from the way you can.</p> <p>You bend your elbow against the counter and open your legs a little more. I can feel the hem of your skirt and the material rub against my finger tips.</p> <p>You lower your arms a little, arching your back and thrusting your chest up. Slowly.</p> <p>“I want you to put it in me,” you say.</p> <p>I look up at you as I slide my finger along the length of your pussy just a little to the tip of your clit. I can feel the wetness of your wetness on my finger. I press my finger slowly forward. I can feel your heat as it slips into you. I press down, but you move your hips faster into my finger. All I hear and feel is your heavy breathing and the feel of your muscles clenching around me.</p> <p>But, there is so much of it! I know I can still taste the sweetness and scent of you.</p> <p>And, we can do this all day. With me, with you or just with us.</p> <p>You can feel your body tense, but your hips start to rotate against me as your breaths come in short little gasps. She starts to breathe faster and faster. I can feel her body move, just a little bit, in time with the waves of tension in her stomach. You are moving even more than you did before, rocking back and forth.</p> <p>“Oh, God, I’m going to come!” and you let out a little scream.</p> <p>I can watch all the expressions on your face as you come hard for me. My own body tenses even more.</p> <p>As my body stops spasming, the muscles are relaxing. You slowly raise your arms up, letting go of your head and neck. I look down at the front of your dress. Your hair is up and you are still leaning forward to the counter. You straighten out your arms, then reach behind you, undoing the clasp. You slide your arms down, but my fingers still move over your skin to the hem of your shirt. I can feel your skin all the way up to your neck.</p> <p>The buttons pop off and fall to the floor, leaving you naked except for a skirt and your shirt—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
