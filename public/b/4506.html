He commanded. I slowly lowered my eyes and turned my gaze upwards.</p> <p>"You are going to be punished." He continued as he lifted my left arm above my head, stretching the elastic from the rope to the elbow. The next part of the whipping took longer than the last. I could do nothing but sit and feel the intense pressure as he tightened it as high as he could. The blows became harder and harder and more severe, and I did not mind them as much as the next and after. I had been trained for this and I would not cry.</p> <p>I could feel the skin on my back beginning to turn a little. Then the pain of the leather. It took me a moment to realise that I was not alone. He started to whip me again and I squirmed and tried to wriggle away, I could do nothing but watch his movements.</p> <p>Gradually he stopped and pulled the rubber band from between my skin and the rope. The rubber band had been loose before, so he ripped it away with one pull of my arm, making the pain a hundred times worse as he did so.</p> <p>"Stand." I was ordered. My mouth was dry.</p> <p>He stood waiting and then put a pillow behind my head.</p> <p>"No, please," I began to plead. He stopped and looked down. I felt as though I were in some sort of nightmare as he walked around me. He sat down with a strap and strapped it to my head. Before he attached it again, he pulled the other end of it into a ring. He did the same with the other end. When he had finished, I was kneeling face up and wrists stretched and tied to my ankles. I could feel my breasts pushed forward from the leather and the leather straps. My clitoris was erect and throbbing, but the sensation was not so intense. I felt a pressure on my vagina and then could feel an object pressing directly onto the lips. My lips were swollen, I felt the lips being stretched and, in response, a slight pressure around my clitoris. The sensations were too intense. But I had to admit to being quite aroused by this and the sensations made me moan with the intensity of it. I felt my breasts being manipulated roughly and suddenly the pressure on my vagina was removed, I felt that my clitoris and vagina had been pulled out and that the pressure was again applied, but it was not as severe.</p> <p>I could not see but I knew that he had returned and that his hands were busy fondling me, which meant that he had not yet begun and I knew what was going to happen. Suddenly he began to lift the rubber band up and down with his fingers and hands, and then he had me raise my arms and was able to take them and fasten them to my wrists. I could not help but to wiggle against his body as he continued to hold the object up inside of me. He removed the tube and held it high above his hand. He reached down to feel my pussy and the pressure at my clitoris.</p> <p>I was shocked. I had never had a man touch me there, let alone touch me intimately. I wanted him to do it. And I didn't have to do anything with my arms. I just wanted him to know that he was able to do whatever he wanted. He removed the tube and pressed some sort of device against my clitoris. He had pushed the device forward and I knew it had been inserted inside me. He took this device and gently began pushing it in and out, pushing it in and pulling it back as he did so. I could feel my body responding to this. I was feeling his cock pressed down against my back and I knew that he could feel my pussy being stretched by the pressure on my clitoris when he pushed the device in.</p> <p>I had been told that if you can keep yourself aroused for long, then you should climax quickly. I felt his cock pressing against me as he pulled it in, but I could not, it was too large, I could not. I could not bear to be teased more by the pain of the rubber band.</p> <p>I felt a pressure on my abdomen and in response I opened my legs. He removed the device and with one movement of the sleeve of the strap, slid it inside of me. I could feel the pressure pushing against the membrane in between my vagina and the band and the pressure was pushing the device deep within. I was feeling something more than pain, but the combination was not painful. I knew that he must have had the device in him and if he had held it at the base so that it pressed down, it would be able to stay inside of me. I knew that he must have had it inside of me in there.
