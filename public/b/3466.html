I've had sex with enough of the wrong kind of men. But then again, I've only had sex with one boyfriend at one time in my life. And then there are the guys, so there must be some sort of a connection between my experience with you and the guy that took me."</p> <p>"So you're sure it was not a mistake?"</p> <p>"Absolutely.... it was all perfectly innocent and I could only take what I had to offer. But then again, I was already on my mission...... it's now or never.....!"</p> <p>The rest would probably fall into one or another, but right then just the thought of having sex with him took my breath away.... "It's no need to be so naive...... it's as if...." I said giving him the cold shoulder.</p> <p>Then I reached over and kissed him on the cheek, "I've taken a vow of trust and love that no one and I want you to be my first."</p> <p>"I really hope I'm not going to be the first.... I can't think of anything else but making love to you....... I mean how can I expect an average man to handle someone who is so sexy in the sack?"</p> <p>"Oh you'll get over your naivety and that will just be a case of making love to one of the men in that film that happened to my ex-boss... that happened to my other boss.."</p> <p>"Hmmm.... I don't know what to say..." he said as he gave a smile and I looked up. He's gone off with some guy he's met.... no not quite a couple I'll be honest.</p> <p>"He's just a guy that does not mind me seeing you naked... he's not gay.."</p> <p>I laughed then as I felt his erection pushing against my leg....</p> <p>"I guess that makes you my first," I said as I put my hand on his thigh.</p> <p>His arm was still tight around my shoulders as I lifted himself up so that he could lift me, and as we got back to his desk he put his arm around me and kissed my temple and cheek...... "I'll talk to you soon"</p> <p>"Night" I said as I kissed him on the cheek and he said, "See you tomorrow"</p> <p>So that's what we did, right there on the way home for the first timeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
