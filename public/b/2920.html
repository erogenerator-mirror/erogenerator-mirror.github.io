I didn’t care. When he started to pull his shirt off, I started to unfasten my pants. We were already naked now!</p> <p>The next kiss surprised me. Our mouths met in a soft, warm kiss. Our tongues swirled and caressed each other for a good minute. He moved one of his hands down from under the towel around my waist and started to caress my stomach and chest. It was as if I had a mind blowing orgasm already.</p> <p>“Mmm,” he purred again, “I have a little thing for these soft little places.”</p> <p>I just had to go with it! I didn’t have to tell him this. I knew what he meant! I couldn’t stop him from doing what I wanted! I moved against him, pressing his hardness up against my stomach.</p> <p>But I stopped him right there.</p> <p>“No, don’t go there…right here.”</p> <p>Oh my God he could barely reach down to hold my cheeks. I didn’t have to tell him. He started to kiss my lips with a hungry passion. I couldn’t wait to feel him inside me!</p> <p>I opened my mouth to invite him in, letting his tongue press inside. His hands slid up under the towel and started to caress my breasts. I opened my mouth for him to slide his tongue inside. I had a wonderful feeling of excitement and excitement. His hands kneaded my tits as I pushed against his cock against my stomach. I let go and let my lips drop down his chest to his nipples. He responded by sucking my tits gently.</p> <p>“Are…are you…?”</p> <p>I gave a little yelp of fear, but he was enjoying himself. He cupped my ass in his hands and started to thrust against me in tempo. I wasn’t expecting…I knew what he wanted! I let his nipples push back against him and started rubbing them. They were harder than I’d imagine possible!</p> <p>His lips left mine and he trailed kisses up and down my neck. He kissed and nibbled the skin at the top of my cleavage. I spread my legs at first, but he never moved between them.</p> <p>He pulled the towel over his head and we embraced for a long time. My arms went around his neck and my breasts pressed into him even more. My fingers found the hairs of his chest. I ran my fingers through his hair. The scent of hair was overwhelming to me. I felt like I needed him to be like this forever.</p> <p>Suddenly, I felt his mouth on the back of my neck. He sucked on my neck while his hand caressed my ass. I couldn’t believe what I was feeling. His hand felt so nice on my ass. The heat and pressure of his hand felt heavenly to me. I pulled to him a little more. He kissed my neck again and then the inside of my ear. The warmth of his lips and his tongue drove me crazy. I wanted him, but he just moved his finger on my clit. I was so warm inside and when he entered his finger, he made a sound of ecstasy. It was his first real touch on my pussy.</p> <p>I couldn’t believe how good he made me feel. He started to kiss his way down my body, kissing and licking my abdomen and thighs. His mouth moved slowly down until he was almost touching my pussy. I let my head fall back into the pillows of the sofa and felt him spread the lips of my pussy with his fingers. He found my clitoris easily with one finger. I let out a squeal of pleasure. I’d never had this before and I wanted it. It was an indescribable thrill. That one touch felt so good to me. But he had another thing he wanted to taste too, so, all he did was to kiss his way down to my clit. I couldn’t stop myself from wanting him. I felt every single inch of his mouth on my pussy.</p> <p>I reached out to touch his head. I felt his breath on my thighs. His tongue licked the folds of my labia. When his tongue touched my clit, I felt waves of pleasure start to course through me. I was trying to force my hips higher in his face and for the first time, I opened my legs as wide as I possibly could.</p> <p>When your legs open to you in the middle of the day, do you really think you can manage a good position like this? That could easily have been a disaster. I was glad that I was able to do a fair job of it! His tongue flicked my clit and I started to hump his mouth—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
