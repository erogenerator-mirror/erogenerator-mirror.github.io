I love it." Her eyes had closed and her breasts were moving as she licked and sucked, "Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!"</p> <p>I couldn't believe how great it felt to be eaten like this. Her nipples were so sensitive, they sent a tingling through my skin. I pushed her up and she lifted her head, looking at me with half closed eyes. For a moment all I could think of was the incredible feeling her mouth was giving me.</p> <p>"I think I need to return the favour now," She said coyly.</p> <p>"Mmm," was all I could manage as I was already on my knees before her. I pulled her back so she was sitting up, so I could get her head into my lap. She sat there passively, while I slowly stroked her hair back and forth.</p> <p>"Just relax, okay, just do what you are wanted to and you'll be okay." I massaged her neck, working from shoulder to ear, to her lips which were slowly moving. I ran my fingers along her collarbone and down her throat, then to her chest. I ran my fingers down her breasts, back down to her nipples which I tweaked and rolled, as my thumb continued to rub and stroke at her clit. She arched up into me, almost out of my hands, and I started to squeeze her breasts harder and harder, causing her nipples to harden and her breath to get faster and deeper. She started to moan softly and her hips started to move. I leaned back a little so I could suck on her hard nipple again while my other hand was massaging her other breast. Her hands were going to be all over me, but she had to wait, we had only about ten minutes.</p> <p>Finally, she lifted herself and I put her to bed. She turned to look back at me as I lay down on my back. She crawled up next to me and pressed her breasts against my face. I began to lick and suck her nipples, as I moved from one to the other. My dick was hard now, and I reached down and ran my hand along it. I rubbed it in small circles as I sucked. I wanted to touch her clit, but instead I reached behind her and felt for her ass. I slipped a finger in. So far so good, I thought. I felt around it and she made no move to stop me. With my finger I took her ass, I rubbed her ass hole, moving down to her hole and pushing inside.</p> <p>Soon she was shaking harder, as I pushed harder into her. She came with a loud moan, I felt her pussy tighten and she let go of everything and grabbed the sheets in her hands, her legs began to shake. She was silent and it was the most violent orgasm I've ever had. Then she opened her eyes and looked into mine, and said "No," very softly.</p> <p>She was all mine now.</p> <p>* * * *</p> <p>I'm a little embarrassed, for reasons known only to men in the past, and my friend was right. I was not going to take that chance anymore, I wasn't going to risk my friendship with a straight man for anything. It has to be something more.</p> <p>I'm not sure how I get myself off with the stories, but one thing I know for sure is that whatever you do or don't do, do something to bring it in to the scene. I didn't do anything with a straight man. I did what a straight woman tells a man to do.</p> <p>I can't say I wanted to do this, but I guess it's because of what I did. I think it's a part of my fetishâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
