Her voice was smooth and her face so sweetly innocent; despite her beauty, her words were a little dangerous, and I couldn't help but think how nice it would be if I were a little more forward than just the most polite and respectful person in the office.</p> <p>She turned to me and saw my expression as I sat back in my chair. She smiled back at me, then, and stood beside me.</p> <p>"You can keep an eye on the door. Remember, I don't want to leave this office un-noticed."</p> <p>"I know, Miss Evans." I said softly. I could feel my cheeks burning as though I had been a little rough.</p> <p>"I know you. You're right, you don't have to do this. I'm not going. I just want you to know that..."</p> <p>"Miss Evans, please forgive me." I said, knowing it was very sweet of her to have me in such a condition. I had been feeling a bit stupid, I know, but then again I was pretty well beaten earlier that day, and I didn't want to show that I was being a little bad.</p> <p>My lips parted for her hand and the word passed through me like a warm river.</p> <p>"Please leave. If you are staying, you will have to tell me, please don't let me bother you again, Miss Evans."</p> <p>"I don't know."</p> <p>"Please don't let me bother you again, and please, Miss Evans, please do this, it won't happen again, please don't let me go, I promise." I felt almost as though I had committed an cardinal sin, but there no shame in letting her bother me.</p> <p>She moved forward until we were almost face to face. My heart pounded in my chest and my head felt light. She was so young, so untouched, and yet, despite the fact that it seemed that she would never regret being my student, and although I couldn't imagine her spending time out here with no work. It was very hard to imagine anything else in my life.</p> <p>"I really should... I really should do this," I said, and then as if in a sudden lull, "But Miss Evans please..."</p> <p>She smiled at hearing me.</p> <p>"You have to," she said, nodding her head slightly. "Just do it, please."</p> <p>I knew that she didn't mean it, but I felt it was necessary. I could understand my situation now. She was making me her student.</p> <p>I couldn't move my legs. My hands were trembling and my throat was dry. I wasn't sure what I would do. What was happening to me was really hard for me. I'd never felt anything like it before. Not even the best cunnlingus that I'd ever have been lucky enough to have.</p> <p>She looked at me for a moment.</p> <p>"Please," I said. I felt the weight of my situation as well as my confidence. "It's okay. You can do this. Just please don't get mad at me."</p> <p>She gave me a mischievous grin.</p> <p>"I'm not mad. I can't think of anything else. I just want to make sure that I've got everything covered. I need your help."</p> <p>A bit scared, but I wasn't worried about her. It was so much easier to do this with someone than without. I'm sure there were times when someone would actually want to leave and wouldn't want to.</p> <p>"I'll just go," I said hopefully. "Just, you can stay if you like."</p> <p>"No, no, I'll stay, I promise," she said with a smile.</p> <p>"Don't worry," she added quickly, "Don't worry."</p> <p>I wanted to kiss her. I wanted to tell her how much I loved her, how much I just adored her. That's why I'd been trying to get into that situation with her. I wanted to be her friend. I would have been the sweetest teacher I could ever be, but I was sure that she wouldn't be the one to tell me how to handle it.</p> <p>"Come on, let's get you a robe." I said, and as she began to slip out of her uniform, I helped her out with it. I also helped her with her own blouse. I didn't feel like a teacher. I felt like maybe I was doing something that I was reluctant to do, but that really was all part of the experience. I didn't want to be the first one to touch my girlfriend on the way home from work.</p> <p>"We could go out for dinner," I suggestively suggested.</p> <p>"Oh, I think I just need to take my uniform offâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
