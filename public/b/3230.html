I'm thirty-nine, and I'm still not ready for kids. But I'm still looking for a good job, that's for sure, and besides it feels like a good job." He then told her to get on the couch, and he sat in the front facing her. He grabbed her thighs and pulled them up so he could watch her from a kneeling position on the couch. His hands ran around her thighs from the ankles up and he pulled her legs back in and held on to them, while his mouth continued to kiss up and down her slit. His fingers probed her cunt and he slipped into her to touch her clit.</p> <p>"Oh, baby! You're so wet, I can hardly feel your cunt. I can't wait anymore! I'm going to cum as soon as I enter you, " he said and he quickly pulled out. He then brought her off the couch and sat her on the ground, while he continued to lick her clit, and then finger fuck her. This went on for a long time, each of them coming in turn. Finally, he pulled away from her and she asked him to lie on the couch. He lay on it so that he was on his back and she straddled him slowly, slowly taking his full length into her pussy. She lifted herself up so that just the tip was in her and then dropped herself down so that it was barely touching him. She then started to rock back and forth, up and down, up and down, her body shaking with lust as the sweat dripped from her, and his. After about five minutes, she grabbed one of her tits and rolled her nipple around between her fingers.</p> <p>"Oh, fuck, yeah!" she said, as she continued to bounce herself on his cock. "Fuck! Oh, fuck! I'm cumming! I'm cumming!" She yelled while bouncing up and down on his dick. After another 15-20 minutes, she collapsed on his chest and she started to cum all over his cock. She laid on his chest as she finished, breathing heavily. She then got up astride him and sat on his prick, slowly starting to move up and down.</p> <p>"Oh, fuck! Oh, it looks like you came today!" he said. "That is just awesome!"</p> <p>She then leaned back down and kissed him deeply, and she lifted herself up once she felt his cock moving in her cunt. She looked over her shoulder at him,</p> <p>"How about some more?" she said and they kissed. She then stood up, turned round and bent over, presenting her hot cunt to him.</p> <p>"Yeah, fuck me now baby, now!" he said and she eagerly grabbed his cock and guided it into her.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah! I want you to cum inside me tonight! It's been months since I've been fucked! I want every drop of jizz of your cum."</p> <p>As he approached his climax, she began to ride him faster and faster, pushing up and down and holding his arms to herself, as they both got closer and closer to orgasm.</p> <p>"It feels as if you just exploded baby! I'm gonna cum!" he said as he felt himself get closer and closer. She quickly pushed herself up to her arms as he continued to thrust into her, holding on to her thighs as he came in her. He kept cumming as she held on to his arms, as she pulled his cock out of her cunt, and they just held each other.</p> <p>They were both completely spent as they collapsed on the couch. They held each other, their bodies covered with sweat, their hands roaming around. After a few minutes they both drifted off to sleep, both with smiles on their faces. She knew that she had been lucky to have a man like Steve, she just knew that it would be good for her now. After a while, they got up and dressed, and went downstairs, to clean up the mess they had made. She decided to make him breakfast this time, but she didn't get to finish yet. As she was cooking, she noticed a package inside the fridge, and it looked like it was for Steve.</p> <p>When she walked in, she saw the FedEx guy on his back at the desk. His eyes were closed as he chewed on his food. A second later, he looked up and noticed her standing there, and he stopped eating.</p> <p>"Hello, do you have a pen?" he asked, and walked over towards her. She handed him her pen and said,</p> <p>"That was for you."</p> <p>"No problem!"</p> <p>Suddenly she felt a cold hand on her face and looked up at the man, who was still eating from his breakfast tray.</p> <p>"I just finished packing your bags for this party, Mr. Johnson," he said.
