That first touch would have made me come, right there, right then anyway.</p> <p>"I haven't felt it yet. It's rather warm and it feels really good against my leg, although I think I'll manage somehow." He said, with a very soft voice. His hand brushed up against my pussy and I shuddered. He smiled and said,</p> <p>"Then I'm about ready for some relief."</p> <p>And so started the first of a series of love-making sessions. And after that, things had moved on to other activities. I suppose that all your fantasies would be about fucking me in the park or to watch me take it up the shitter? It turned me on tremendously, to think it a little more than just the one night.</p> <p>Then I met Mike. Mike was a nice guy, quite a bit younger than me and he's the one that talked me into going with him for a stag-season at his school. We were a year apart and he was going with a buddy of mine. I met him right out-of-the-door for first sight for which i am extremely grateful. I had had a couple of 'girl-on-girl' sessions but he was a bit out of my league so after the first session, I wasn't averse. We went out for a drink and one thing led to another; we both got a bit of a boner at the end of the evening. We had no sooner said goodbye at the bar and he asked me if I'd made another conquest. I said, "A couple of nights ago i wasn't a single man. That's what I love, being in control."</p> <p>He said, "It would be a shame to find out that i know some one just to get close to you."</p> <p>I giggled and said, "You know I'd love to be close to someone and it would be nice to feel their arms around me." I leaned against him and we kissed for a while. We kissed a little and then he put his arms around my waist and pulled me against him. It was the most passionate kiss on earth and I think we both groaned with delight with lust, our tongues caressed each other. He pushed himself as deep into my mouth as he could in response to what I wanted. His tongue was long and lashing and he seemed to know every nerve ending within it.</p> <p>I wanted to take control by him as much as I wanted to give him what I wanted and he did a very good job, I think because he also let me feel his hardness in his trousers. He wanted me to take control again, so to speak. It was the moment of trust: a guy is going to tell you what to do. We knew that our chemistry was strong enough to take command and when it happened, it was very special. But, well, that's all right, I'm just too much of a novice.</p> <p>I stood on tiptoes and put my arms around him and pulled him over to the sofa where he sat with his legs over the armrest. I went down and sat in the arm chair, put my hand to his lips and said, "I've got some good news and some naughty news."</p> <p>"What's a good news?" he asked.</p> <p>I slid forward in the armchair so that I could rest my head on one tippee-oh so that he could see what he was going to do. What a beautiful, sexy image he had right there in front of him. I stroked his cheek with the back of my hand as I kissed him; this was a wonderful kiss. He put one hand on the back of my head and slowly started to trail his fingers along my neck and down through my hair.</p> <p>"You know," I said after a little while, " I've wanted to do this for a long time now. And your name is James. And I thought that's what you were going to say."</p> <p>"And, now that we know each other, what is it that you want?" he asked me.</p> <p>"Oh, Mike," I answered for him, " what you wanted, your man."</p> <p>He said, "Yes, you are right. I want to see your pussy." He sat right next to me as he pulled my arms behind my back and pulled off my top.</p> <p>His lips took the place of his hands on my breasts and his fingers moved slowly over the tops of them, just caressing the flesh with the tips. They were very sensitive, I think that we both knew it, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
