Then they got their coats and walked to the front door. The doorbell started ringing, but all they heard was the siren of the sirens in the distance.</p> <p>"Good luck," Jodie whispered.</p> <p>"You have the best of luck..."</p> <p>Chapter 6: On the Road to the Valley of the Sun</p> <p>A week later when we walked up to her house, they asked, "Have you got anything?"</p> <p>"No. That was my husband's suggestion," she answered. He didn't look at her but smiled.</p> <p>"Didn't you meet him?"</p> <p>"No," she quickly answered. They both smiled at each other.</p> <p>Jodie had no idea of what she was going to do next.</p> <p>"What is it?" she asked as they walked into the house.</p> <p>"Well, he bought us a beer or two," he said. "And I'd like to make a date with him," he explained.</p> <p>Jodie's eyes got a little glassy.</p> <p>"Okay," she said.</p> <p>"Just don't start it," the guys said, laughing as they walked her to her bedroom. They pushed a button on the cell to get some TV to listen to as they passed by her door.</p> <p>When she opened the door, they kissed.</p> <p>"Oh, thank you," Jodie beamed as they started kissing her.</p> <p>Jodie pulled down on her husbands' boxer shorts and said, "You don't have to do this anymore, but I really want to."</p> <p>"I'm not taking you back down here, Jodie,"</p> <p>"Then can I take off one another's?" she asked breathlessly as they stripped each other.</p> <p>They sat naked in each other's arms, kissing for minutes while she rubbed her hands and hands all over her husband's body.</p> <p>"I've been wanting to do this for a long time," Jodie whispered.</p> <p>"Me too," he admitted.</p> <p>She pulled at his boxer shorts, freeing his dick. It sprang to attention as she leaned over and took it in her mouth. She kissed it all the way from the tip until it was sticking out in front of her face. She licked it all around the head and down the thick vein on the side too.</p> <p>The guys pulled Jodie on to the bed on her back.</p> <p>"God, let me do that to you," she said. Jodie took her men in her mouth right to the tip then slowly swallowed the entire thing. It tasted salty sweet like a fresh drink. He kept sliding his dick into her mouth until the tip bumped her tonsils. He felt her mouth moving back and forth.</p> <p>"Oh, fuck," he exclaimed. She kept sucking his cock and sliding her lips along his meat.</p> <p>Then she sat up and said, "Go ahead. Fuck me." She took her husband's dick into her pussy.</p> <p>He moved up and placed the swollen head on her lips. "Oh, you're so wet. It's so good," he moaned as he moved back and inserted his cock into her wetness.</p> <p>She was so wet that his balls were sliding across her clit and up and down the length of her vagina.</p> <p>"So good. I love you. I could only do this once before," he exclaimed.</p> <p>"Oh, oh, I forgot about the next time."</p> <p>That's why we never let anyone touch you," he said in between moans.</p> <p>"Oh, this feels so good," she responded. She started moving her hips up and down and back and forth.</p> <p>He increased the speed of his thrusts. The feeling was unbelievable.</p> <p>"I like it, too," she said. "It's all my fault. He's the star of my sex show," she said.</p> <p>"I can see the problem, I mean. There's so much that I've never done. I thought it would be weird being with another man," he said.</p> <p>She didn't have to be asked twice. She just reached up to fondle his dick and balls as he fucked her.</p> <p>Jodie turned to him, looked into his eyes and smiled. "Do it, honey."</p> <p>He moved slowly at first.</p> <p>Jodie started moving up and down, lifting her hips to his strokes. They came together as he moved the tips of his fingers around her small tits while he was thrusting his own hips back.</p> <p>"Fuck meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
