On the desk is a leather-bound copy of the original. When I sit upon it I begin to read. It's the same copy I had been holding in my hands when he arrived. It's like old times, a few pages of a book. It's all a bit familiar and yet so very different. The cover is of some pretty graphic nature, yet somehow I feel I knew him well. I can't take my eyes from it. Then to my surprise, I can feel my mind thinking of places that have been described to me. My eyes wander over his desk, pausing on various parts of his office, but never settling on his personal space. There is something of his touch on the edge, it's not the book, just himself.</p> <p>My mind thinks of how to keep him and his books and his personal space. My mind says that there is no way for me to just sit and have fun with him when I'm a woman, but what I really want is to be alone with him. He just takes my face in his hands and kisses it, the look on his face that tells me how much he really loves me. I have never felt more vulnerable, loved, desired, or desired in my life, let alone in such a small space. I realize that I've been falling for him in my mind as well, and that somehow I've become attracted to him. If everything I've been thinking is him, I'd go crazy.</p> <p>"Can I take you home?" He asks. When I glance over my shoulder, he's already taken off his coat. I watch his tie slowly come undone as he begins unbuttoning his shirt. It's my turn to be surprised. Once he's down to his boxers, he drops it to the floor and his eyes follow. He's a boy. I don't want him. It might be time to talk, let him stay. The way he looks at me will drive me insane. I stare at him and his chest, then down to where his boxer briefs lie at his ankles. His legs seem to part in order to allow his cock, which just happens to be semi-erect when he walks, to spring up like a flagpole. His cock has sprung almost free from its cloth prison and I can see the tiny drop of pre-come that is collecting at the head. I can't wait to feel how it feels to touch it.</p> <p>"You ready?" He asks. I nod and he leans forward to kiss me. My body, already on edge from what may be his, responds to the kiss as though it's not what I'd anticipated. I feel a tingle in my groin, a tingle that's familiar. Our mouths open, and our tongues entwine. He presses the top of my head onto his chest, not pushing it to the floor, but letting him feel the skin there and it feels electrifying. His hands slide up my waist to grab my breasts, and I start to get light headed with the excitement of those first few moments of lovemaking.</p> <p>His hands make slow, deliberate circles on my waist, the first one pushing my back against the table as we share some of our own passion. I'm moaning as his hand slides under my shirt for the first time and feels my nipples tightening. I can see his eyes open a bit as he watches my reaction. He's lost in the fantasy that his hands have created between us. My breasts swell from his attention, the nipples jutting from the soft, warm skin. I feel him touch the tops of my bare breasts and hear the moan of desire to him in his lips. He continues his slow, deliberate pressure with his palms as he strokes my nipples with his fingers. The first caress brings a flash of heat to my heart, a flash of pleasure to my loins.</p> <p>"Are you ready for me?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>His hand moves lower until it is between my legs, feeling the heat and wetness that was there only moments ago. I am so wet. He can feel it, feel me, in me. Our bodies slide against each other as our fingers reach for each other. The feel of his hands against me as I move my hands up to cup his face and pull him into me. I feel him slide my tank top over my head and toss it aside onto the back of a chair. Oh god, he's a woman. Our tongues caressing each others, exploring every corner of each other's mouths. I kiss him harder, deeper, and his hand moves faster as his finger moves into my wet warmth. My mind, mine and his have an entirely different meaning than where I thought they were headed.</p> <p>He slides his finger back into my center, then starts to move it in and out, fucking me with his finger. His face is close to mine, our cheeks touchingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
