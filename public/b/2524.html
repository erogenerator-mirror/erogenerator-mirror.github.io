It's just like when you're sixteen, even if you still can't remember why..." I said, my mouth full of popcorn. "Are you OK?"</p> <p>"No. Okay. I'm fine. It was just a shock. I was still drunk, actually." She seemed so relieved. I wondered how much she had told me last night.</p> <p>"There, that didn't bother you, did it?" I tried to change the subject.</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Are you sure we shouldn't go with them to the party? I don't want to do something like I did yesterday in front of Mom and Dad. No big deal."</p> <p>"We don't have to worry about it being a surprise, if it's OK," she reassured me.</p> <p>"I don't think we need anything else from Mom and Dad." I didn't know what I was going to say to that.</p> <p>We got home from the house early, early enough that we had time to go shopping. Dad was still at work. We were in the living room when Mom came bouncing in the room. She had on a new dress. I felt like I had forgotten about it, even though I had already gone shopping.</p> <p>"What does she look like?" I asked, pointing to her.</p> <p>"You'll have to take a look." She looked at me like I had just suggested that she look at herself. "I'm not sure how much a dress looks like."</p> <p>After buying all sorts of dresses, and taking every opportunity, Mom told me about her day, the other women, and even about her own experience with sex. I found it interesting and then realized it was about how she'd felt at home that had happened. As far as she could remember, all had been an experience.</p> <p>"So that's the start." I wondered over what happened in her marriage.</p> <p>"No," she said, not sure. "The other woman's sex life was pretty vanilla. Not like yours or my husband's. Just a bit of experimentation for her. We went on a bit of a wildcat ride last night, and had two orgasms that night." A wicked grin came to her face. "But we didn't stop after that."</p> <p>"What else?" I asked, remembering the first.</p> <p>"We didn't have any privacy." She laughed.</p> <p>"I thought that was because I was afraid we were going to make trouble for you."</p> <p>"No, this is because I wasn't too sure about how you felt about it." She laughed again.</p> <p>I realized I could tell there was something there. Was it that I couldn't tell her about the old house in my mind or was it another part of her personality?</p> <p>"Let's go upstairs." I helped her up from the couch and we went upstairs, and I was a little surprised that the bedroom seemed quite brightly lit. I had a feeling it was going to be a bit darker than last night, even though Mom had seemed more relaxed over it at the time.</p> <p>She had a very nice and innocent look to her.</p> <p>"Are you ready?" I asked. She nodded and I led her into the bedroom. I sat her on the bed and pulled off her shoes. We were still kissing, almost an affectionate expression.</p> <p>"Hmmm, let's see how soft they are under your feet." She let me put my hands on her, gently running her fingers through my hair. She held me there for a minute so I didn't feel dizzy with need. Then she put her hand under my shirt and started pulling on my nipple with her big toe.</p> <p>"We're taking this slow," I said.</p> <p>"We were careful today," she agreed.</p> <p>After another minute, I had her up on her side, and was kissing her all over. I was on top of her, my penis deep in her. I began to move slowly in her, gradually making contact with her. As my penis pressed against her, she rubbed it against her. We were kissing, very intense, slow and open. I pushed into her a little harder, and her eyes widened.</p> <p>"Oh. No. Take it easy. We're too new." She laughed.</p> <p>I wanted to push her back onto the bed and fuck her good, because I was almost there already. But I wanted to show her who was boss, because it sounded natural, even for an old man. I was a little disappointed, but it was a lot of fun, and I didn't want it to end too soon. Besides, being a mature man, I wasn't afraid of losing it too fast. I wasn't worried that she would hurt me, because I was sure she wouldn't mind if something happened between us, or that she would hate meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
