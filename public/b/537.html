"Who, anyway, knows she'd love for me to take her on an outing once I go back to college? This is about my family."</p> <p>"I don't know if I should mention that you're one of our new best in town."</p> <p>"Okay," I started, blushing a little. "What was her name again? Sarah."</p> <p>"Hmmm," he said, "Ned's name?"</p> <p>"My mom said I was a 'little hottie' and that she's a pretty 'big girl' when it comes to dressing for a date."</p> <p>"So it wasn't just you I was dating?" he asked, "I mean how'd she react about the date?"</p> <p>I laughed, "She said that I was pretty into 'those things' and she said it didn't bother me." I wasn't sure how to get that out, but what the heck had gotten into me? And anyway, we had never met anyway, and certainly she'd never met me. I took a deep breath and sighed. But I was excited, too. I wanted this!</p> <p>I tried to relax him a little, saying, "That's why I agreed to let you pick me up in a bar or motel or...I would love to have you be my first."</p> <p>"It's on the list, and I haven't gotten into that yet," he said. He stood up and picked up a shirt off the dresser. "I'm out of shoes now."</p> <p>I didn't know how to react, so I just nodded and followed him out into the bedroom. I watched him turn around and put on his shoes, then the door. My heart began to skip a beat, and I felt a tremor run through my body. Then he walked away, turning back around.</p> <p>He stood there in front of me, waiting for me to come around and look at him. He was absolutely gorgeous! A tight-looking dark blue t-shirt tucked in underneath a pair of tight black jeans that showed off his firm buttocks and toned legs. His hair was a little messy and it brushed his shoulder. He seemed very young, almost nineteen I guess. But I found it very attractive. He smiled at me and leaned down a bit to kiss me on the cheek.</p> <p>"You're pretty hot for my family, huh?" he asked.</p> <p>I looked at him, not quite believing my own ears. "Well, um, yeah, sort of," I finally muttered. I felt like a silly little girl, "you could really be my first."</p> <p>He stepped up a bit closer and hugged me. "I'm glad you decided to show me what it can do," said him.</p> <p>I thought about how I loved being touched, kissed and cuddled by my brother. He was very warm to me. He made me feel young and beautiful.</p> <p>Then suddenly, he held out his hand, and in his trembling fingers, I reached out to him. He pulled me into his arms, and before I felt the pain of the loss of my virginity I thought that this wasn't good, or that he hadn't just had his way with me. Instead, he felt like a man, and he didn't seem to care that it hurt. This time was different. I didn't care that I was his little girl and he was going to have my hips.</p> <p>I thought about my dad for a moment, and then remembered how it hurt him to be with me. What did he want out of it?</p> <p>We stayed like that for hours, but gradually I began to relax, and I wasn't so upset with my decision. "I don't regret it," I said softly.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," he said, with his eyes still closed. He pulled back and looked at me a little sadly. "I never thought I'd want a girl like you ever again, and I'm sorry that I can't make you happy," he said.</p> <p>"Thanks for letting me stay with you," I said, "My parents never liked me hanging around out here."</p> <p>"They were strict about that," he said. "I guess they think that if people can't get over the fact we're your first in town, who knows? It's really neat to see you out here."</p> <p>"Thanks, really," I said. "I don't know how much longer I'll be, or how long it was going to be until I'd be out in the same place as you in a couple nights." My voice cracked a little. I didn't exactly feel like I needed to be anywhere for the next eight months or so if that was what I thought. It was so sudden that I almost missed one of the other two days. I could feel myself getting flushed all dayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
