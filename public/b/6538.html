Her fingers continued to caress his shaft, circling and stroking as she watched him take in his new appendage. Her mouth watered as she watched it grow larger and larger, and she longed to taste it.</p> <p>Her fingers were on a mission now, stroking lightly up and down his shaft as a low moan escaped her lips. The taste of pre-cum was in her mouth, and her fingers worked their way down into her cleft, touching her pussy lips and clit, rubbing in large circles.</p> <p>With a quick glance around the room, she realized that some of the people working the other side of the desk were now sitting on the edge of the desk, their hands busy and busy, and one of them was staring intently down at her own hand working on his cock, watching intently as her little hand closed around it and began to pump it up and down. Her fingers were moist with her wetness and her juices and dripping over her fingers. She couldn’t wait any longer.</p> <p>"Ah, I'm gonna cum! I’m gonna cum!" she thought to herself and began to stroke it harder. "Oh, god, that feels so good . . . "</p> <p>Her head came up to meet her lover’s gaze as her first orgasm of the night struck. She looked him in the eyes and felt his first tremble of his orgasm in his hand, his cum hitting the back of her hand in long blasts. He watched her as she jerked up and down on the end of his cock and watched her fist as she stroked him, her eyes closed as she continued to moan. Her hand pumped him slowly as she stared up into his eyes and smiled softly as she felt the first jet of his hot cum fill her hand.</p> <p>She rubbed the last drop of cum over his head, smiling softly at his expression as she finally let him pull his softening cock out of her well-lubricated hand. He sat there in silence for a moment before pulling up his shorts, smiling widely as she looked back up at him smiling and wiping more cum in her palm before getting up and going to the sinks in the hallway.</p> <p>He smiled as he heard the sink running and realized that his partner was up already, washing up and going to work as he went for a bottle of water. He took it while he was at the sink finishing wiping down the floor, getting a big smile from her as he finished his task. He noticed her out of the corner of his eye as she sat up a little, looking straight at him and raising one eyebrow as she looked up from her work.</p> <p>With a little shrug, his lips twitched in a silent smile. "Oh yeah, I'm right where I was," he grinned. With a look of wonder on her face, his partner walked into the room with a smile on her face too.</p> <p>"Hey, have you ever heard of a couple that just knew about sex?" She asked the man who had just gotten his cock sucked.</p> <p>“You know where I’m from,” was his answer. “Yeah,” he said. The man was an older man. He had short dark hair and dark green eyes of green and brown, and was wearing a shirt with jeans. He had a white beard on his face, wearing a pair of worn jeans. His name tag read, “Kirsten.”</p> <p>He was obviously a man with a past, but it quickly became apparent that the woman who was with him was clearly a woman, even though the man was clearly in his forties. Their conversation was light, and they seemed to share common ground.</p> <p>"Yeah,” he said after a minute, “yeah," he answered. "No really,” he continued. “I get it sometimes. But I mean, I do understand that sex is different in many ways. Sex isn’t the same thing as having a partner. That’s what I’m talking about."</p> <p>The man smiled, “Yeah, but it’s still the same thing. So, what do you guys do when it comes to sex?”</p> <p>Kirsten was surprised at the question. A stranger answered to her question to herself before she could even think about it. “I guess I give a ‘good hand’,” she answered simply. “So how long are you here?” she asked.</p> <p>The man looked at the woman with concern in his eyes. “Oh no, I was just wondering how long,” he answered. “I mean, I just got a call from a friend, who had been at—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
