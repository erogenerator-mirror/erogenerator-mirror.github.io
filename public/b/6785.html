Tears started to form in her eyes.</p> <p>"I want this to be our wedding day", I said. And for a moment, the thought of being the first to carry this huge load seemed blasphemous.</p> <p>"That is wonderful", she said in a low voice. She hugged me back and the passion that I experienced that morning came back in her arms. She took her glasses from her face and put them on the dresser. I sat down on the bed and held her tightly. Our kissing became more passionate as she held my head to her chest and rubbed my back. She started to breathe deeply and moan softly as we kissed. The passion that I felt that morning in my memory came back with her. It was as if a switch was broken in my brain and we came together like we never had before. We started kissing and I moved my hands down her back and she lifted up. My hand slid down her sides and cupped her warm, soft ass. I slowly cupped and fondled it, which was so firm and soft. She moaned aloud and I could feel my cock starting to stir and getting hard in my pants. I knew that all of the excitement was gone.</p> <p>I laid down beside her and she pushed me back and went down on me. We kissed and kissed and she was so good with her mouth. I was surprised by her oral skills. She never sucked on my cock. She licked and kissed and sucked on my cock as if she was a lollypop. She loved the taste of cum and I liked tasting it. We continued kissing and I could feel my cock getting hard in her hand. She opened her mouth and licked the head of my cock, I moaned in pleasure and she opened her mouth and took my cock deep into her mouth. I started to lick and kiss her, trying to please her. We were breathing heavy and feeling so hot up against the bed. I could feel her body shiver and I knew that she was coming again.</p> <p>"I loved it", she said. She stopped sucking on my cock and began kissing it, she continued kissing and then opened her mouth and engulfed the head of my cock. I felt it start to open and she quickly plunged it into her mouth and began to slowly bob up and down on it. I moaned at the feeling of her mouth and tongue. She was able to take most of my cock down, with her tongue flicking the tip on the underside of the head. She took more of the cock into her mouth and began to speed up her bobbing and she started to moan louder and louder with passion. The tempo of her mouth and tongue increased yet again. I could feel my cock harden in her mouth and I knew that it was time to be inside her pussy. She stopped again and licked my cock again. This time, she wrapped both hands around my shaft and took me in her mouth. I could feel her tongue licking at the head of my cock. As she sucked on my cock, she used her hand to stroke me lightly. With the motion her finger ran up my shaft and circled my cock. She squeezed it and stroked it a little harder. This caused me to twitch and she knew it. She sucked on the head for a second and then released me with my cock in her mouth.</p> <p>"Is that what we wanted?" She smiled as she moved over to stand beside me on the bed. She leaned back on the bed and opened her legs so that me could see her pussy lips opened with the juices that were running out of her body.</p> <p>"I didn't know you would be that beautiful", I said as I moved closer to her. Her lips were glistening with her juices. I ran my hands over her breasts and down her stomach to her thighs. I grabbed her ankles and pulled, and placed them on my shoulders. I looked down at her and smiled. Her eyes were closed and she had this dreamy look on her face. I took her hand and held her finger to my lips as I started to lick and suck on her finger. She had her fingers in my mouth and I knew that I knew what she liked and wanted to do it. I continued to hold her finger and lick her finger as if it was real and I wanted to please her. I moved her finger in and out of my mouth as I ran my tongue over it. She responded to the movement with a soft sigh.</p> <p>After a few minutes of licking and sucking, she brought her other hand up to her nipple and I could see the tip of her finger. I took her finger and sucked on its tip. I put my hands on her thighs and she opened them wider. She pulled her legs up and I kissed her pussy lips once, twice and she kept it motionless. She was moaning with pleasure and moved her hips up to make contact with my mouth. I kept licking herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
