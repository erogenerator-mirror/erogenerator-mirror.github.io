"I didn't know that you were a virgin. I just had a crush."</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I said. "I just felt bad. I'm so embarrassed now."</p> <p>She took my hand and kissed the knuckle of my index finger. She pushed her lips on my knuckle and pulled it in.</p> <p>"Do you want me to lick your cute little pussy?" she smiled.</p> <p>As I nodded my head, I saw her tongue snake out, licking her cheek while she stared into my eyes. I was getting excited again; I loved it, and so did she. She crawled over to me, kissing me on the lips. Her hands slowly caressed my face while she whispered to me that she loved doing that to me.</p> <p>"I have a special treat for you, Josh," she said. "You'll just have to wait, baby". And with that, she was gone.</p> <p>And with her gone, I felt better. I didn't just feel my self-esteem growing with each minute. It was better than that.</p> <p>As I sat there in confusion, I wondered if my ex, was still alive when I opened my eyes and saw that she was on the top of the stairs. "Hey!" I blurted. "What are you doing up the stairs?"</p> <p>"Oh, I love you," she said. "I'm getting up there with you."</p> <p>"Yeah, I am," I replied. "I could stay up there all night. I've got to call my mom or go somewhere."</p> <p>"I know," she said. "But she's not home anymore, either. I love you Josh."</p> <p>"I love you too, baby," I said, kissing her again on her lips. "But you have a big surprise for me..."</p> <p>"What is it?" she smiled.</p> <p>She moved to my side and looked lovingly into my eyes. "You're not going to like it," she said.</p> <p>I leaned my head back toward her, and she kissed me, on the lips.</p> <p>"I don't want to tell you," she said, and I did too.</p> <p>She slowly stood up and looked at me.</p> <p>"I should get a better idea," she smiled. "You want to come in and watch?"</p> <p>"It could be a real mess if you don't put this all away," I said shrugging. "Or you could just ask me what I'm supposed to wear and I could do the same."</p> <p>"I'm not going to wear anything," she said. "I need to get a look at my options."</p> <p>"Well, I'm not sure how many of them you have," I said. "There are about as many as you can get up there."</p> <p>"Good thing your grandma and I want to play with you," I smiled.</p> <p>"Yeah, but just the thought of that makes me horny," she laughed. "Just wait. I'm not sure if I can get you hard again."</p> <p>"Why don't you take your sweater off?" I said. She undid the sash holding it. She looked at me and took off the sweater revealing a pretty lacy black bra. It matched very well with her pale blue silk blouse.</p> <p>"Mmm, just the way I like them," she said. "I'm looking forward to this later." Then she knelt down in front of me. I let our eyes meet and she was looking into mine. I knew that this was going to be a good night: this is all I thought about for years.</p> <p>"You've got a real nice body, Josh," she said. "And you're really sexy."</p> <p>I reached behind my neck and pulled my top over my shoulders. To make it easier for her to do, she took my hands and reached behind my head to unhooked my bra. She slid my arms through the top, then reached around and unhooked my bra. My breasts were firm and perky, with large brown rings that just kept them from being too big and too smooth. My nipples stuck out like little thumbs and each one was a pale pink. I knew I wouldn't be able to control them, even if she was naked.</p> <p>I knew that I was looking at her and I could feel myself getting excited. Her gaze on my breasts was intoxicating. I think she could see my nipples getting erect under her scrutiny. She was definitely into it; she was definitely getting moist looking at my breasts. She slid her fingers underneath my breasts and played with them from side to side. She gently pinched my nipples, then held them.</p> <p>"You've gotâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
