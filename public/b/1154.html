He was naked, and had a beer in his hand. I moved towards him, still dressed, and we were like the brothers we were growing up in. He pulled his shirt back over his head, exposing his torso, and I saw he’d also shed his pants. I walked over to him, placing my hand on his belly, brushing him with my hand.</p> <p>“Thanks.” I whispered. My hand then went on his hip, the only place he’d left it that day, the one he seemed naked under his shirt. He looked up at me in response; he moved in closer still, his body touching mine. It was the first time I’d seen him completely. He pulled me back to him, running his tongue through my lips. I’m pretty sure I went wild, as I pulled him back towards me and I kissed him deeply.</p> <p>At his kiss I saw him reach for his pants. He slid them off and threw them away. He was wearing a white flannel button-down shirt, and his nipples, standing at attention, were peeking out. I could see them poking through the cotton of his shirt. We stood, looking at each other. When we got around to looking each other again he went to his knees. “You like?” he said. I did. I’m still not sure how far I’d had this with guys before this. “Yes,” I said. He leaned down again, taking one of his own nipples between his lips. This time I didn’t stop him. It felt so good to be touched again by a man; if I hadn’t been sitting all alone I may not have. I ran my finger nails down his stomach toward the band of his briefs. I let go of his nipple. The feel of him under my hands caused his cock to rise to attention and it looked so lovely between his legs.</p> <p>When I could stand it no more I stood again. Our bodies came together as we were standing. I put my hands behind his neck and pulled him down into a long kiss. His hardness, through his briefs, pressed against me, its hardness now pressed hard against my belly. I felt his hands move to my back and slide over to the top of my breasts. As our tongues intertwined he let his fingertips slip further down, touching my nipples. When they finally came to rest against the top of my panties I started to move, pushing them down. We held still and parted, just breathing to catch our breath.</p> <p>I turned around. “I love you,” he said, looking me in the eyes. I kissed him again, and he brought his hands up to my face and then pulled me in for another kiss. As our passion rose I took off his shirt and began unbuttoning his jeans. When I had them unbuttoned, I looked into his eyes as he was staring down at me. It was then that I saw he already had another erection. I don’t mean it was a tent, it sort of did – what it may have looked like. It wasn’t a tent, just a hardon.</p> <p>“Does it excite you to see me naked? Watching me with other guys?" he asked in a whisper.</p> <p>“Oh yes. It does every time.” I replied. Our lips broke off from kissing to exchange a quick, almost shy glance. "Do you like it, baby?" I asked.</p> <p>He nodded, smiling, licking his lips. I reached into my pocket and grabbed the condom, and slid it onto his cock. He was standing by the table now, still wearing his briefs. "Let me just put it on," he said. I knelt on the kitchen floor in front of him, the condom still in my right hand. I reached towards his cock and slowly reached around to undo the small Velcro knot, just enough to pull it out of the waist band. When I was ready, I kneeled between his legs. I ran my hands up and down his thighs, running my nails along his skin. Then I ran my hands all the way to the bottom of the waistband of his briefs. He leaned against it, almost falling off the edge. I pulled them down further until they were around his thighs, along with the boxers next to them. He was fully aroused now, and I could see his cock pulsing in the light. He watched intently while I took his cock in and started to stroke it.</p> <p>I kissed his chest and stomach; running my tongue lightly down towards his pubic hair and the top of his thigh. I kissed and sucked as I brought my fingers up to his balls. I ran them back and forth, then gently squeezed them with my hand.
