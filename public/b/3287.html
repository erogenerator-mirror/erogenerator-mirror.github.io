He smiled, pulling me from my chair. "Where's my clothes?"</p> <p>I had been walking over to the table when I felt hands gripping me. Hands all over me, touching, caressing. It felt like a sexual experience, but as soon as one finger slid between my ass cheeks, I was gone.</p> <p>"God, I missed this. I have so much more to give and you've missed every inch of me." I couldn't even think. When I tried to get back to my feet he stepped back, holding me and grinning.</p> <p>"I'm going to take you home..." He growled and slammed me back down.</p> <p>"I haven't got all afternoon." I lied as an apology for coming back.</p> <p>"Not you, I have something else in mind." He growled as he walked over to his table, "Come with me."</p> <p>He took my hand and led me to the couch. He sat, crossing his bare legs and pulling me into his lap. I couldn't get the feeling, his fingers were already sliding between my thighs and they were soaked. He ran his hands over my face, taking my hair off. His fingers found my ear and slowly caressed it as his face moved down to my neck.</p> <p>"That's enough." He was quiet as a tear trickled down my cheek, "You have to tell me if you want me to leave."</p> <p>"I don't." I mumbled through my tears and he cupped my face. He stroked my face and let his fingertips move on my lips, wiping my tears away. Then he kissed me, letting his strong lips part.</p> <p>"It is so important that you tell a guy everything. I want you to know, that he will take good care of you, that you will be safe. You need to let him know that. I'm not taking good care of you, I'm not coming to you to punish you for what you've done to me, I want you to let yourself give in to this. We need to go through this."</p> <p>"You think I'm going to let him hurt me?" His voice filled with doubt. "You can't trust me."</p> <p>"There is another way." I grabbed his tie and tore the loose part. "Can I trust you? Can I do that with you?"</p> <p>"That's it. It's not for you." He wrapped the rope around my wrists and tied them to the corners of the couch.</p> <p>"Why does he think I will let him? If I let him hurt me, that means I have to." I whispered and reached into his pants, finding and then stroking his cock.</p> <p>"So you're not going to just let this happen? Let him come back for you?"</p> <p>"Maybe." I reached with my other hand and wrapped it around his shaft, my hand barely stroking him. I could feel him hardening as he looked up at me. "Don't you want to come back to me?" I felt his hand running up the back of my leg. It was so close to my ass, I could feel it moving slightly and then I felt him.</p> <p>"Fuck me, Jason..." I begged as his large finger brushed my rosebud. He felt so large, his finger had never been inside me. He pressed a finger inside slowly just to add the lubrication.</p> <p>"I need this." He gasped, "I need your ass."</p> <p>I couldn't believe it. I felt the tightness, I ached and wanted... more. I pushed down on his finger slightly, I wanted him to finger me. I needed him to fuck me. I moaned, "I want him to fuck me."</p> <p>I felt his finger press slightly inside as he leaned back a bit and spread his legs a little wider. He reached down and found my slit, his fingernail tracing lightly over the lips gently. He pressed a finger inside, stretching my entrance as his finger moved inside me. "God..." I moaned as I pushed down hard on his finger. "Fuck me, Jason."</p> <p>He began to finger fuck me as I let his finger stroke in deeper while he stared up at me. "Yes." I whimpered and felt another finger press against my ass hole. "Fuck me, Jason..."</p> <p>The finger entered me slowly as I was pushed down and then slowly back up with each passing. Jason's lips tightened as he took a breath and pressed his lips to mine. He pressed his finger in harder and started to finger-fuck my ass as I let my other finger push down harder on his finger. "Tell me when you're going to come."</p> <p>I groaned as I pushed down on hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
