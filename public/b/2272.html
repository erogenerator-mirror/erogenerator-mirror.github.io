"Pam, are you ready? Your outfit is coming on." With that she dropped her robe to the floor, revealing nothing else.</p> <p>She was wearing a pair of tight, white, stretch-marked slippers with wide open toe. The feet were covered with black satin and the toes were covered with dark brown leather, with the toe tips showing.</p> <p>"Put your arms through these." She instructed.</p> <p>Her breasts were barely contained by their tight slits. "Oh, sorry," she said as she began to bend and straighten her arms, "I was just trying to be a tease today. It's difficult to do in this short outfit."</p> <p>"It is kind of sweet," I teased. "Thank you so much, ma'am." As I held the hem of her robe up I felt no bra. "Oh, well, I'm sorry, but we'll have to wait a bit before you wear a bra."</p> <p>She blushed a little and just grinned. "Oh I'm ready, ma'am."</p> <p>I slipped the robe off her shoulders, exposing her naked shoulders and back to my gaze. My hands slid down, down, down her back, caressing and squeezing her soft skin before pulling the hem of the robe up and raising it up over her head and letting it drop, covering her. I was entranced by the sheerness of her skin and felt my cock harden noticeably.</p> <p>I saw that she was wearing some black leather high heels that came up at about knee level, with straps in the arch. When I reached up to untie the straps, she held herself firmly as I did so.</p> <p>"Oh, I don't know," I mumbled as I removed a blindfold from my pocket, "I just want to see if you're wearing any shoes."</p> <p>She nodded, smiled at me, and slipped her shoes from under the blindfold.</p> <p>I was breathing quickly as I put on the blindfold and took in the sheerness of her hair and the sexy look of her feet encased in black stiletto heels. The feel of her skin under the blindfold was just so tantalizing that my cock was fully erect.</p> <p>She took my hand and led me into the house. "There's some wine in the kitchen, please."</p> <p>We walked past the bar and out into the yard. She had one hand by my head. "I want to make a toast. To new friends and lovers." She set her glass on the coffee table, "To new friends and a very special evening."</p> <p>We sipped the wine and talked as we talked. My cock was still hard, but in its soft state the attention was enough not to get it to an immediate, painful state. She smiled over at me and I felt her hand slip between my leg as we talked.</p> <p>"So, this is how we started," I thought aloud, "how we came to be talking about my having sex with my cousin." I didn't want to get to the sex part of the discussion so I steered the conversation to this situation. "Is this the place, Pam?"</p> <p>"Yes," she said in answer as she stood up from the table, "and this is where I live."</p> <p>I didn't know what was going to happen but it had to happen.</p> <p>"Let's go in," she said as she led me to the front door. We walked into her apartment and Pam stood back, with her right hand casually stroking my erection, looking me in the eyes.</p> <p>"I like the way you're so comfortable inside," she giggled, "and I also like how your cock is getting hard, like I'll tell you. It's exciting but it's not that big."</p> <p>"That's okay with me," I whispered, "and neither will you. It's the same for me."</p> <p>"You won't tell anyone," she said. "We didn't talk about our boyfriends and only discussed going down on each other. You need to be naked."</p> <p>I didn't know what she was talking about. Maybe she was talking about her mother's advice in college.</p> <p>I didn't care. I stepped out of my jeans and kicked my shoes off. As I did, she dropped her robe and her breasts were exposed, and my eyes followed down to their fullness within the sheer, open top. Even with me standing there, they looked so tempting that I just stepped forward and planted my hands on the sides of her breasts. I squeezed them softly and pulled on the erect nipples, eliciting a moan from her.</p> <p>"You're like a cat," I said. She looked up at me and smiled.</p> <p>"Yes," she said with a giggle.
