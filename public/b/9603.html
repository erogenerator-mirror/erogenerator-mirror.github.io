This is the first time you've said anything to me that would cause harm, or trouble. Have you ever been with anyone?"</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"And you have never been with anyone but yourself? Have you ever had any real sexual relations?"</p> <p>"No Ma'am."</p> <p>"No way, is that so? Tell me, did you like it, if you had. Tell me the truth, now."</p> <p>"No Ma'am."</p> <p>"What did it feel like? Did it excite you?"</p> <p>"It did Ma'am. It made me excited!"</p> <p>"Did you cum?"</p> <p>"Yes Ma'am, I came very quickly, but it did the trick again, though if I had known then I would have done it for you, didn't I?"</p> <p>"Yes, you can trust me, I'm not sure you ever will again."</p> <p>"I hope you are right."</p> <p>"Now you shall tell me." And with that she picked up her panties, put them on and walked away, not saying a word. I stared at her ass before turning around in my seat, which was now half up. If I could only turn around a tiny circle, I would have found what looked like a very nice tight and round ass. I sat there, wondering what other surprises she had for me. A few moments later she returned to hand me my drink and said, "Would you care for a drink Miss Tawny? There is a little ice cream in the freezer if you'd like it for dessert."</p> <p>"Oh yes please, may I?"</p> <p>"Of course," as she walked back to the kitchen and came back with two large wet mugs to put on my tray. It was not a very large tray, but I was a little tired from the exercise and it did get me plenty of the ice cream. I thanked her and handed the cup and spoon back to her, she smiled and said "You are my teacher tonight, isn't that so?" She took my hand and put my hand on her ass and said "I was hoping that maybe you are willing to do some very naughty things for me." She giggled again and stood and took my glass of ice cream and put a finger into my lips and said "Taste this and tell me if it tastes as bad as you think it would." I opened my mouth and she put her finger in and slowly swirled it around and around my lips. I sucked it, I swallowed it, and then I asked "How many people do you practice tonight?"</p> <p>"Oh my God, how many!"</p> <p>"Did that girl ever practice at all?"</p> <p>"She did, once on my hands and knees."</p> <p>"And what about your ass?" She stood on the balls of her feet, she seemed to move at a normal pace, and then she moved one of her hands away so that her finger was now in an upside down V.</p> <p>"You know I do," my mind raced a bit. I had never played this sort of scene with anyone before.</p> <p>"Would you like to do that for me?" It was almost a question. I was really confused. Did I want to do it with my teacher? If so, well, I might as well make the most of it.</p> <p>"I think so."</p> <p>"Go on, lick the finger again. You sure want to taste it."</p> <p>"Yes Ma'am, I want to."</p> <p>"You know it is better to make the point."</p> <p>"But Ma'am,"</p> <p>"Do you think that it would make me feel bad? Do you really think that I'd ever kiss you and suck your pussy juice from you?"</p> <p>"No Ma'am, I thought it would make you feel good, I can believe that." But it didn't. Maybe if she really did have to go to work out the problem, it wouldn't be so bad.</p> <p>"Would you like to do it with me?" And for the first time, I really felt the need to ask, do what I didn't think I could do. If I had my way, why shouldn't she? I was nervous and a bit hesitant.</p> <p>"Can I ask you a question?"</p> <p>"Of course. Why do you do it?"</p> <p>"I don't know, maybe because it will make me feel good. It's not like I'm going to have sex with you. I can be pretty good, I guess, but what if I'm not a good kisser?" (I had to ask the question once again.)</p> <p>"You're right, very well. It's just that, well, I just didn't know what to think about kissing you."</p> <p>"I love it whenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
