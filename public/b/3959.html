I really needed to cum. I could see the men at the entrance to the lobby getting closer and closer. I imagined this lobby with the big stone pillars like on the elevator and it did nothing to calm my raging hard on. I looked around at the people on the elevator floor, mostly men but a few women including my wife from earlier and she was smiling broadly. I looked down to where my pants and underwear had been hanging loosely from my hips before, and saw a huge bulge in them. It looked to me as though we had been fucking for hours. I had no idea what had caused it as I looked down at my own pants but they were soaking wet. I had to know.</p> <p>The elevator doors opened and we hurried to our table, and I took a seat with my hand outstretched, "Hi."</p> <p>She answered and I held up my hand to stop her.</p> <p>"This is Steve. Steve, this is my husband Tony."</p> <p>"Oh yes, Tony." she said as her hand reached out and pulled his chair away and into the other. "I was afraid you had left me with those last few drops."</p> <p>Steve had to look at her, "Thank you, no need. I am not your husband."</p> <p>Allison then reached to pick up the glass I was drinking from. "No, this is our lunch. And if you want your lunch please eat quickly." She pulled two plates out, setting them on the table. She set Steve and I down at our sides with our backs to the table and then she sat down in our chair between Steve and himself. He leaned forward to get the food from the other table.</p> <p>"I don't like to see my lunch being eaten with a bunch of guys talking all the time."</p> <p>"Steve" she said loudly enough for all to hear, "you should not talk in front of your friends"</p> <p>He looked at her, "I don't know what you mean. If there is anything I can do for them please say so. Please"</p> <p>She got a good laugh from him, "You will have to be the one to order this lunch Steve. And don't be a stranger to it. And you should try and order it from the menu."</p> <p>I could tell that she was really getting into it now. She was being a little loud with the other people inside the restaurant so everyone could hear. Steve reached for the menu with his fork. He seemed to have a bit of a problem trying to write it down.</p> <p>"Oh my! I see. I didn't know they had this in their hand right there."</p> <p>"I know that you just made the waiter stop to pick-up our meal." as she took a swallow of her wine. "It's not a fancy lunch and it's not too nice."</p> <p>Steve just looked at her and smiled. "You can do better? I would appreciate if you don't get me all hot and bothered just sitting here with a bunch of guys talking about your pussy and eating you out. I never thought about it like that... but I know. So if you don't mind I got myself started...</p> <p>"Not at all." she laughed as she lifted her glass to take another sip of wine. "My god you have an amazing body. I have been meaning to touch it, and that thought is just exciting. Steve though..." she laughed again, "I know but right now you are so hot I could do this." Her voice then trailed off and it was back to business. "So I am sure we will meet again soon, at about one o'clock this evening. And don't you dare waste your breath drinking it with a bunch of men. We can be the only ones here and then you better put some pants on." Her eyes dropped and she reached to put her hand over mine when she realized how close we were. I could feel her heartbeat against my hand.</p> <p>"I don't think I can go that far." I told her as I looked around to make sure no one had overheard us.</p> <p>"I know baby, but you just might do that for me if you put it in your mouth." she pulled my hand to her mouth. "I want you to. You have been teasing me for weeks and now I'll finally get the chance to touch you. It will be a special occasion. If you can make it a special occasion." she put my hand on her pussy again. "You need to eat me now. I don't want to go to the bathroom and have to give up my chair without making you feel how good I really am with my mouth. Then make love to meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
