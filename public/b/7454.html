I answered softly. I tried not to cry because I thought that my beautiful fiancé would understand. I loved her so much and I could not give this up so easily. After all, I had been in love with my best friend for three years and I was almost certain to marry her in six months. I had been on the pill and I loved how she would feel about sex.</p> <p>Owen had always fantasized about her being a girl and the way the other girls and I would be having a threesome! She kept telling me she was saving myself for marriage. When I told her that would be the end, she promised me a great surprise. I was thrilled! She would have to wait for me to tell her if she wanted my body next. That was so special and special to me!</p> <p>For the next six months, we had our time together just like they had been during the first four months. Before that, though, I was content with the way our love life had changed. I was looking forward to having my fiancé visit my house that weekend. It was so special to be back home again! As was always the case in my life, the past two weeks seemed to be going by so quickly and suddenly. There was no need to rush the love making now.</p> <p>The last few days, I think I saw what she was trying to tell me. She told me that it was time for her to be on top and fuck me hard. Her pussy was wet and begging for me to enter her! She lifted herself up and took my entire length and held the head against her opening. Then she slowly lowered herself and pressed herself back down. It was really the first time I had ever fucked someone who had never had intercourse before.</p> <p>When I felt myself starting to thrust my hips up into her, she started to kiss me and I felt her finger again. When I began to move my hips, she moved mine down. As I began to grind myself against her, she reached behind and pulled my ass forward and our pubic hairs ground against each other. She ground her pussy hard against me as she lifted herself up and down and back again and I was going nuts. When we had finally managed to find a slow rhythm, we were both moaning and breathing hard.</p> <p>By the time we finished doing that, her eyes had not left my face. She pushed herself down completely and I felt the weight of her bottom pressing my pelvis forward. That was the moment I had to tell her that I loved her and wanted to go to her.</p> <p>We went and got my car keys and I drove us into town. By then, I felt that I had to tell her about the threesome with our friends earlier in the morning. It was not really a problem but I think I had to go with that and maybe I would tell her how happy I was and hope to be here for her even more.</p> <p>As I drove us home, I was really disappointed that there was no one else on the block, but when we got there, I told her that I would be waiting and hoped she would be happy to hear from both us sooner. As we reached the door to go inside, Owen grabbed me around my upper arm and kissed me.</p> <p>"You are so much more than an innocent teenager, aren't you," he said. It was an attempt to get us into bed with his big dick between our thighs, but we broke our kiss anyway!</p> <p>I gave him the look of a boy waiting on the big time; not wanting to hurt him, I simply said, "Owen, what are you talking about?"</p> <p>"Come in the house for a minute and talk, just to show you I'm not a madman and you can trust me!" He said.</p> <p>I could not explain what I wanted him to say, but I thought I should tell him, so I started to tell him what I had done. About fifteen minutes later, he came in.</p> <p>"Owen, what am I going to do?" he asked.</p> <p>"Don't worry about it. Just enjoy yourself and I'll take care of the rest." I said.</p> <p>He sat there for a few seconds and then looked at me and asked, "Is that it?"</p> <p>"Well, it is very hard to tell you whether you will agree or not with the next installment," I replied.</p> <p>"What about the threesome and the surprise party?" he asked. I smiled and said, "That is another one of my fantasies!"</p> <p>"Let me tell you what happened," he said; and he brought something that I could only assume was a tape recorder, a long piece that was just about a foot long and about a foot wide and with the same antenna.
