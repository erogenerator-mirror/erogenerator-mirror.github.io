All the while, the girls were doing what they were doing to me. I felt the tip of my cock rub up against the opening of my jeans and I realized that my cock was getting bigger by the second. There was a knock on the door. The girls got up and went to answer it, but after some awkward looking faces, they both started talking again. It was going on about some girl who just decided to take matters into her own hands and get a blowjob, but when the guy's pants started to fall out a little, things got awkward, and they started to try to get back inside the room. I was getting very uncomfortable. As the girl's looked at me nervously, they both gave me one hell of a big smile and walked back towards the door.</p> <p>Once they were gone, I started to get mad. "You can't do this, she's just doing what she's doing now, she's a big girl that can't do anything right. What am I supposed to tell her?"</p> <p>"You can tell her," the guy from before said. "She can't see you right now, you know, but she could."</p> <p>The girl from before looked puzzled for a second, and then she walked over to me. She grabbed my cock and started to get a hold of it, and then she leaned down and started to lick around my tip, which made me even more uncomfortable. She grabbed the base and started to roll my balls in her other hand and then lowered her mouth and then started to take my entire tip inside her mouth and throat. I gasped at first, but her technique was working me like crazy. The sensation of her soft lips squeezing the base of my prick was just about too much to handle and I was really afraid she'd choke on my dick. I reached down and grabbed her hands and she stopped, but didn't stop as I reached under and grabbed her smallish breasts and started to tease my thumb across the nipples, making sure that she wouldn't choke on it. I kept stroking them both in my hand, making sure that they were rock hard, and then I moved my hands down to her shoulders and pulled her back up so that we could start to kiss.</p> <p>Our kiss was passionate, our mouths exploring each other's mouth as our tongues probed each other's mouth. A part of me wanted to give her body completely, and if I had, it obviously would have done to me. She also wanted me to be completely in control though. She could have done anything to me or anything at all, she just didn't.</p> <p>I leaned back and looked at her through my dark eyes and she grinned as we locked eyes in a deep, intense and meaningful look. I let my head fall back against the wall and let both hands wander freely down over her soft and well formed breasts. She leaned me to the floor in front of her and I could feel that our bodies were pressed against each other. Her lips were at my ear and she licked it softly.</p> <p>"Does your girlfriend, you and I do that too much," she breathed. "You know you make her feel better than you did."</p> <p>"Yeah. It's all in the expression of passion between lovers." I smiled at her. "That makes her even more than she is."</p> <p>"I think I just want to get her to come harder than she was before. That's a lot of sex in a little bit." I could tell that she was really looking me in the eyes and that she wanted to make this moment as memorable as it was possible to be. There was no way she could resist me right now.</p> <p>"Well, I want all of it."</p> <p>With her hands on my shoulders, she pushed me to my knees and then I was looking up at her. Her head was hanging down in my lap at eye level now, and her left hand was playing with my balls and she looked so sexy I thought I'd melt. She lifted her left leg from the floor and put it up on the sofa. Now she was kneeling on it, her ass at the edge, her face inches away from my cock.</p> <p>"I want to lick you," she said in a very soft, quiet voice that had the most erotic, innocent, sweet tone. I was looking her up and down now, just at the base of my cock, her little pink tongue playing with the tip and then licking it up. She kept at it, and the feeling of her tongue sliding over and around my cock was almost too much. The sensation of her tongue gliding from the tip down to the shaft was just too much for me. Every time the tip entered her mouth, I imagined her soft lips sucking my cock. Then the feeling turned to pure bliss. I felt her tongue move up and down across the top of my tip and Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
