It had long since been since I'd let a guy really make me his. It had been a year since I had let a guy really go to town on my hole. The fact that the man had my body now and the way he'd taken me that second time only added to the fire. Maybe it was a need that wanted to be fulfilled.</p> <p>I was glad to hear something. He had to say it in his own words. I was feeling a little dizzy too and just about ran out of the door at almost the same time. "Let's go!" I said to my buddy and I didn't even wait for a response as I hurried down the path toward where this strange man was headed. The only time I saw him was in a parking lot, and he had his back to the road, so I couldn't see who he was, only what a total stranger I was taking me into his home and into the bedroom.</p> <p>Once inside the darkened house, that's where I left my clothes. But then again I didn't care so I quickly unbuttoned my blouse and got in the bed with the stranger. He started to undress me, kissing each part of my body as he went. Before long I had my blouse off and layed in the middle of the bed; the stranger's penis was hard between my legs and he wanted to make me come. "You are so beautiful!" he exclaimed when I didn't stop him, so he started to kiss my breasts. I was breathing hard and when I was on the verge of a major orgasm, he stopped kissing and moved to lick my neck down into my cleavage, kissing, biting and biting down and down into my cleavage. I couldn't take much more and I pulled him up and put him on a chair as I lowered my head to his. I could taste my own wetness on his lips. He was on his knees and I lowered my head to his, both of us now naked. He opened my legs, and I could feel his lips kissing me, as I felt his tongue touch my hole.</p> <p>It was then that my lover entered me. He pushed his manhood in and started moving in and out. I reached out and rubbed his face, enjoying him kissing me. Then I kissed him back and took him in my mouth, tasting my juices on him. He was so hard he was going to come in my mouth. But somehow I controlled the situation and he started to move faster again to keep it in me. I had only started sucking his penis when his body was tense and I suddenly felt his semen shoot down my throat and I swallowed all the hot, sticky juice there.</p> <p>He let me go and then turned me over on my back and entered me. I had had him so ready for this it took only a minute or so before I had him in the most exquisite time of ecstasy inside me. I couldn't have thought much more about the fact that I had lost my virginity and that this man was now going to take me for the first time. As far as I had been concerned, he was a normal guy that had only been with a few girls and that it had only been sex. Then I saw the dark-haired stranger standing at the foot of the bed, his hands going to his pants and slowly unzipping them. My friend had gone to pick up my clothes from the ground and I turned to him. He nodded affirmatively and was quickly naked. We didn't hurry but rather just took our time undressing each other, enjoying each other.</p> <p>He was a little hesitant to get me naked, so I suggested we should wait until he was better. I sat him on the chair in front of the chair and knelt down in front of him. He looked up at me and I nodded, then kissed it so that it glistened. "This is a new pleasure for me, I'll bet," he remarked, his hands touching the back of my head. I began to stroke his penis, slowly at first. I wanted to explore the shaft of skin on his cock, feeling the veins of his head. I slowly traced his cock with my finger, feeling the length. But he kept his focus on my hand on his shaft and told me to move his body, feeling my lips wrapped around the head of him. I complied with his request as was, his cock felt perfect, firm and hard between my hand. I stroked him faster, my fingers circling the head, feeling it expand in my mouth. I wanted everything I'd imagined, every inch of him, every part of himself. With my other hand, I continued to squeeze and caress his testicles and his legs trembled, but he had already begun to undress. Before he could take off my pants, I moved from him and reached forâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
