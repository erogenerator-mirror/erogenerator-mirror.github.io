My dress and hair were brushed and conditioned, and the dress was a shimmering pink, with a little shimmer to accentuate where the dress went. The final touch for me at that moment was a simple red bow, and the bra I wore when we had sex. After applying my makeup, we sat in the car and talked about whether we wanted to come to the restaurant or not.</p> <p>"I'm guessing the wine was having a negative effect on you as well?" I asked. They both looked at me in surprise, and then they asked themselves if I had gone through it with the whole idea. I think they had a little bit of a chuckle. We pulled in and parked, and I helped Heather into the seat beside the guys. We ordered and made sure the meal was ready. The guys made themselves at home together since it was going to be a long night.</p> <p>When we had finished eating, we ordered another bottle of wine and chatted some more. The conversation between us was friendly and fun, and I began to feel good about the time we had spent with everyone. After about twenty minutes, I stood up, leaned forward and wrapped my arms around Heathers waist. As I did, she leaned down and kissed me on the lips.</p> <p>"I love it when you're with me," she whispered to me while taking my hand in hers.</p> <p>"Is it all right if I join you in the shower?" I asked.</p> <p>"Of course," she said, and then they both got out, as if nothing had happened on the trip.</p> <p>After getting out of the car at one point, I went inside to shower off the oil and the lipstick. Before I got out of the shower, I put on a knee-length dress, and a pair of sandals in my bag. I walked into the kitchen and sat at the dining room table to enjoy the food, and read a few chapters of the book next to my glass of wine to clear my head.</p> <p>In the kitchen, I saw a guy waiting on the table for me, but didn't know exactly who he was. A woman came into the kitchen, looking a little different than what she wore when I was there. "Hi, Mrs. Thompson, I am looking for a woman to talk with because I hear you are meeting a friend here and that there are more than two young men you know in your home." I asked in a friendly voice.</p> <p>"Oh, no, my wife is with my friend." The woman smiled back and replied, "So, can we talk here then?"</p> <p>"Why yes, I'm available." I said, and we made room for the other guys.</p> <p>"I believe I will just sit out in the room for a while," he said, making me feel good that he did not seem to notice how much I looked like the mother of three younger boys that I had seen at the market. I looked at him, and noticed he was smiling at me. I wondered if I had a line that could actually be crossed, but I didn't care as long as the smile stayed on my face. I was still feeling good, and was ready to move my plan to a different place to begin our relationship.</p> <p>Heather had been gone for about six hours, probably since she had left home. The guy that asked me for my driver's license came into the other room, and looked into my face. "I need another man's opinion, right up inside of me," I said. He looked at me as if he recognized me, and then looked out the window again. "I think it's okay for people that age to know that they aren't old enough to be comfortable telling a man anything about himself. I don't have a husband or a father," he said with a slight laugh.</p> <p>I gave him a light smile and got up. Taking his hand, I walked to the table where he was waiting and sat next to him.</p> <p>"I've finally decided that I want to go to the man's house," I said. "I hope that we can just go straight to the restaurant."</p> <p>He looked at me kind of funny, and then glanced down at his own crotch. "It's a date," he said, and then laughed at himself and replied, "You don't need to do that. I'm sure I can take care of myself." We all laughed at that, and he looked away after a moment.</p> <p>"Would you like to go with me to go get some ice cream from the car, or would you like to come back to this table?" I asked him.</p> <p>"That's fine," he responded. "Do you want to follow me back to the car?"</p> <p>"Yes, pleaseâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
