"If something really good happens, we'll never speak of it again and it's never repeated."</p> <p>D'Alfred's hands were shaking. "She's beautiful."</p> <p>"You just don't measure up to her. It's hard to say whether that counts as a compliment or not."</p> <p>"Thanks!" His words were so smooth.</p> <p>D'Alfred put his arms around her and drew her to him. "I'm so happy you came along," he murmured, "and we've really enjoyed each other."</p> <p>Alfred was just gazing deeply into her eyes. He'd always thought he was the most beautiful man in the world and now it seemed he was the one, too. He didn't know whether he should be happy or sad.</p> <p>She was so beautiful.</p> <p>"Would you want me to take you to bed?" she asked, with that hint that was always waiting in his ears, "because I'd love to."</p> <p>Alfred grinned. "Oh, yes. I'd love to. That way I can feel everything you'll feel." He pressed a kiss against the top of her head, a loving act. "I'm pretty good for someone like you."</p> <p>"So am I," she whispered, "but not as good as you, but better."</p> <p>"I don't want to be that way to you," he assured her, "but I know you're beautiful and strong."</p> <p>"Don't even try to tell me that." She was still leaning toward him, and he could feel a wet patch where his dick was pressing into her belly.</p> <p>"D'Alfred," she said seriously, "I'm not just talking about you, you know. I mean it. I wouldn't go any further than that. It's a little unfair of me to say that," she said in a small voice. "But you already know me so well. And I'm pretty happy right now."</p> <p>D'Alfred knew that she was blushing again. But he couldn't let her be so bold as to say the way he knew. "I'm not going to judge just because you want sex. I've known you for a long, long time. And I know how you feel about men, too."</p> <p>"No, thank you," she replied, "that's sweet." She turned away from him and kissed him on the lips. It was a tender, loving kiss. She closed her eyes and leaned into his hand, and as she did, she pressed herself against him, pressing her nipples into his chest. She held the kiss and ran her fingers through his soft hair. "You're the first man I've ever held, and I never want to pull away."</p> <p>D'Alfred lifted her up in his arms, cradling her against his chest. "We'll do everything you want," he whispered, "or I'll want to go back to my old ways, just like the rest of your men."</p> <p>She reached between them, finding his dick and moving it up and down. "If you're interested," she said, "I'll be glad to take you up on it... but only if you get naked first."</p> <p>"Well," he said, "I should probably let you pick the bed and take a shower first."</p> <p>"No, wait. I want you to."</p> <p>"You're all wet, and I'm all sticky on the end of that thing."</p> <p>"I haven't been on a shower for a while."</p> <p>"Well, we'll have more time like that."</p> <p>"You don't have to..."</p> <p>"D'Alfred, I said I want to take you up on your offer, but... I have other reasons." He was puzzled by this. She wasn't sure she wanted him to try anything. Was he kidding her? She'd thought they'd be having sex, but it hadn't ever occurred to her to try to have sex with him, or to invite him to accompany her. After all, she'd never done it with anyone before. He was probably right. "If you feel too forward, you can always change your mind."</p> <p>D'Alfred reached for her hand and pulled her toward the bed with a wave of his arm. "I'm not doing this for your sake." He dropped to his knees and picked up a towel off a bathroom counter and started drying her off with it. She was a little surprised when he did that, though she was sure that he would have stopped in time if she'd done any of it herself.</p> <p>"Are you going to let me take your shirt off?"</p> <p>D'Alfred chuckled. "As long as that's a request that you can't ignore," he said. He had this little grin.
