She cried out when I pushed her back onto the bed. I began removing my clothing as she kicked and tried to get me to stop. After I was in all of my glory she pulled her eyes up and looked at me. With the aid of her hand she gently caressed my hair as I stripped off my clothes.</p> <p>"No please," she whispered. "We can't."</p> <p>I took her hand and brought it to my lips and kissed the palm. Her hands came to her waist as I kissed the knuckles and her skin.</p> <p>"We can't," She gasped. "Not just yet."</p> <p>I was a man of my word and I wanted her no less. Her eyes were pleading with me to take her, to make her mine, to claim her. But, it could wait awhile and I knew that I couldn't. I lay down beside her and she turned and fell upon me. We kissed, as a man might kiss his lover before he's eaten his wife's pussy for dessert. I couldn't help but kiss her as she continued to tease my cock. She felt the tension of my body, of the way my chest began to ripple and move with my rising heartbeat. I tried to think of something else to prolong the torture, but it was very hard to concentrate after the first few seconds of me fucking her.</p> <p>After only a few moments I pulled her back up onto her elbow and began kissing her again. She moaned and sighed and pulled me in tighter. Her hands and fingers slid down my body and cupped my balls. I was still a virgin and I was no stranger to masturbating but she was so inexperienced that she could barely touch me. I had watched several porn films and knew all about foreplay.</p> <p>She began to rub her fingers faster against me and the harder it was to control the movement. Her other hand pushed down into the crack of my ass and began to caress my balls a little faster than I did. Her thumb rubbed just below the tip of my cock as she brought me higher and higher into the clouds of pleasure that she was creating for herself. I could feel her hips begin to move more and her soft breathing. The heat emanating from her was like a furnace that her body could barely burn. In fact I could feel the heat from her coming almost as soon as I entered her and her eyes seemed to start to roll back into her head.</p> <p>"Oh," she squeaked as she began to orgasm, the intensity of my cock and the speed of my movements increased until she nearly swooned. "Oh, god I love your cock." She called out. "I want it in more."</p> <p>She pulled me close and held me tightly to her. I could feel her hair sliding on me as she lay on top of me. "God, you're so big. I can't believe I even thought it wasn't hard. If this is what I wanted I'd just lie here and be happy."</p> <p>"I'm glad I was able to make you happy," I said. Kissing her mouth, I gently began to rub her tits. She groaned with each stroke and pulled me deeper in, her breasts rising and falling with each breath. "Yes, like that. That's it." She called from between her luscious breasts. "Harder."</p> <p>I began to pound the bed with her and she lifted her face from between my lips. She moved her hand from my balls and I knew that she was climaxing as soon as her orgasm began. Her legs tightened around my waist, pushing even harder into me. I could feel her juices on my cock and I began to lose control. I let loose a groan that turned into a roar as I came with her, my cock twitching with each spurt.</p> <p>"Yes," she cried out again. "Fuck me baby! God, I love your cock."</p> <p>We were both panting and she had tears in her eyes. She kissed my cheek and reached up to stroke my cock. "Honey, would you stay until you go to sleep? We don't do anything for weeks at a time," she panted. That night we snuggled and kissed each other tenderly. It wasn't the last time we made love, but that is another storyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
