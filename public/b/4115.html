"We can stop, before we both get too scared. Besides, I'd rather not have our relationship destroyed by all this 'caught.' Besides, what do you think we should do," she giggled with a wicked grin?</p> <p>I looked down at her in total shock, my eyes trying to adjust to the darkness.</p> <p>"I don't think we ought to do anything," I hissed.</p> <p>"Me either," she said, her face taking on an anxious expression. "We can't be doing this."</p> <p>"We can't, we're not even doing it," I insisted.</p> <p>I tried to keep my head in a safe place for what I assumed was one last chance for me to say yes. I was in uncharted waters. My body still had much to learn and I wasn't ready to make any more choices. What was I going to do? What I hadn't decided yet was whether I wanted to go on this crazy adventure again?</p> <p>She didn't push. She just gave me a quick look and smiled that wicked smile.</p> <p>"Don't worry, you never know 'when'," she said with a wink.</p> <p>I shook my head in agreement before following her upstairs to my room.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Several minutes later I sat on the edge of my bed, my mind racing, wondering what my next fantasy of my wife would be. I was about to find out.</p> <p>"Honey, do you still love me?" I groaned as the phone began to ring. "I'm on the way upstairs."</p> <p>"Yeah," she said. "It's only two more minutes."</p> <p>***</p> <p>We got to our condo in a little over an hour, my wife's car already gone. In one of the spare bedrooms I sat in the dark, trying to think what I wanted to do. After a moment or two of indecision I took my suit coat, scarf, and bag and wrapped it neatly on the bed, the lights off. I put my wife's things away, then hung the black bag beside the bed, then opened my bedroom closet and took out the black scarf.</p> <p>I took my bag and bag down stairs and back into my house.</p> <p>"We're going to my old house," I told my wife as I pulled out the black bag. I dropped three of the black bag onto the coffee table, then opened the black door that led into my living room.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Her voice startled me, and I was taken aback. My wife's daughter, Elizabeth, was at a party that I knew I couldn't attend. She had on a red dress that clung to her body like a second skin. Her makeup was subtle and elegant. And the contrast made her look very sexy. If I wasn't so mesmerized by her daughter's body, I would have been jealous.</p> <p>My eyes moved to the other side of the room. The lights in the room went up, so her daughter stood by the window with her arms up, her eyes on the other window, and her dress up at the bottom. I smiled as I remembered her saying yes to this, and then realized how easily this could happen, so I moved silently up to her.</p> <p>I slipped the scarf over my wife's eyes, and slid it around her neck. She looked startled, then smiled a big smile. Then, as I had hoped, she leaned in and gave me a nice long sexy kiss.</p> <p>I moved forward, taking her hand, and lifted her from the chair. I slid her into her bedroom as well, then pulled the dark curtains out and closed them. Without looking, I opened her dress even more, then pulled the material to the side, and revealed that her nipple were already protruding from her left breast.</p> <p>"I love your breasts," I whispered into her ear.</p> <p>I kissed the nape of her neck as I slid the straps of her bra down off her shoulders.</p> <p>"I love your breasts too," I whispered in her ear.</p> <p>"You're all I want," she whispered back as our mouths came together.</p> <p>I knelt to the waistband of her panties and slid them off. Then my mouth came down to her exposed nipple.</p> <p>"Oh, honey," she moaned as my hot wet tongue flicked over her nub.</p> <p>Her breathing quickened, and as I slid the panties slowly off, she gave me a lustful look.</p> <p>I put my hands on her thighs as I lifted them. In one motion I slid my boxers off and we slid together on the bed.</p> <p>I felt her naked breasts against my chest as we moved.
