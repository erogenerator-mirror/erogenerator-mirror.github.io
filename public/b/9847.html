I just haven't had any experience yet."</p> <p>"So you've only just met a girl? That's quite a difference, isn't it?"</p> <p>I could tell from his tone that he wasn't being overly dramatic. I was intrigued.</p> <p>"Actually it's only a matter of finding out what her tastes were." I replied. That was one of the things which made it worth to me to keep going.</p> <p>We reached the end of our run and his truck came to a stop. I got out and took his hand. He took it in his and kissed the back. I held his other hand up as we shook.</p> <p>"Will you call me when you're ready?" I asked.</p> <p>"Of course Sir, I will."</p> <p>"Ok, see you soon".</p> <p>"Bye for now, Sir".</p> <p>He smiled and we drove off. About 15 minutes before we approached home I saw his truck up ahead.</p> <p>"I'll go grab my things" He called as I shut the door behind him. I turned to face him and he kissed me deeply, pulling me closer and pressing his groin against me. That was all it took. I pulled him into the house and threw off my shorts, letting my juices drop onto his lap in the process.</p> <p>"I'm in the mood for a big lunch tomorrow." I teased as he smiled and slid the bottom of his suit jacket up over his head. Once exposed, he quickly unbuttoned his shirt before undoing his jeans as we kissed again. I slid his jeans down over his hips allowing them to drop to the ground. He stepped out of them and kicked them away. He was hard already from the anticipation he'd been having this morning, and he was already in my mouth. I took his balls in my hand and massaged them slowly as I teased him with light touches and kisses on his neck. When I felt him get a little bit more aroused, I began sucking his cock gently and he leaned back against the wall.</p> <p>"Ohhhhhhh..." He moaned as his pleasure began to build up. His hand slid down my body and found my clit. I couldn't restrain myself anymore and I slid onto the sofa next to him. He took a nipple into his mouth and began sucking it as I began rubbing his cock through his pants. I was really turned on now. He kissed down my body, stopping occasionally to kiss and licked his way down. He took my skirt off and undid the button of my top. I raised my arms letting it fall to the ground with my skirt. He took a moment to savor the sight of my large breasts with no discernible pattern. I reached up and held them tightly, feeling the warmth on my hands.</p> <p>This was his favorite thing to do when I wanted a piece of him. He began sucking first one, then the other until they were shiny and erect. His hands slid around my ass and began to caress at the small of my back. He then slid down my body letting his face slide down the top of my pants with more eagerness. When my pants were down, he began to lick at my pussy through the fabric of my panties.</p> <p>"OH GOD!" I whispered. "Please, use your tongue and lick me".</p> <p>I was about to put my panties in his mouth when he reached into the front and pulled them out as well. His tongue slipped under them to touch my clit and he began licking and tasting my juices again. I could feel myself going crazy. I was breathing hard, breathing faster, and I was starting to lose control after just a couple minutes.</p> <p>He rose up to my face and kissed me again. I opened my mouth allowing his tongue in. I tasted myself as he tasted me. He began to slide his cock between my lips again as I ran my tongue over the head. I could feel the ridge right between my lips and the head as it rubbed against my clit. As I felt the urge to climax build, he stopped and slid my panties down my legs. They were still in his mouth but they had slipped down my other leg so that I could feel his warm tongue caressing my skin. I pushed my hips up begging him to put them where his mouth had been. I wrapped my legs around his waist as he slid his boxers off. I could feel him against my clit as he stood and pulled me up to a sitting position once again. His fingers ran across the lips of my cunt as my hips moved under his touch, my whole body tinglingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
