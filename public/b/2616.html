Finally, she collapsed on me, her breasts pressing against my chest.</p> <p>"That was hot," she said breathlessly. "We should do it again sometime," she added, lifting herself up. She kissed me quickly and rose, looking at herself in the mirror.</p> <p>"I'll look for you then," I said, smiling wickedly, and she kissed me again.</p> <p>We left the hotel and were in the car, the driver's seat still warm and ready. Carol's car was on the lot, and I pulled up just as the car turned into the lot. The driver's side door opened and Carla slipped inside while the other guy got out. I pulled her into my arms once more.</p> <p>Carla turned her face away towards me, her eyes dark and unreadable.</p> <p>"I'm gonna be really mad if you don't..." she whispered.</p> <p>"Hush," I whispered back. I cupped her face with my hand and pressed her forehead against mine. "I'll keep your secret," I promised.</p> <p>Carol gave me a squeeze as she began to cry into my shoulder. It took a few minutes, but the tears finally stopped and she collapsed into my arms, her cheek pressing against mine. Her sobbing slowly calmed, and eventually, she lifted herself up and came around to kiss me again. She reached over to kiss my lips and whisper in my ear.</p> <p>"This morning, I'd been so scared. I wanted it so badly, but I couldn't keep quiet. I've finally learned how to tell you how to talk to me when I'm alone."</p> <p>I didn't expect to get such a direct message. I smiled, happy that I couldn't have her.</p> <p>"We should go back," she said.</p> <p>"We should?" I asked. "If you'd have waited for me in the morning."</p> <p>"Don't think we can get back on our own feet yet," she said, holding me tight. "There are tons of other ways for me to make you happy. I could tell you about my sexual dreams before we left, and you'd love me too. It's not like making love. It's more like getting it from both ends. And I can't wait to be with someone who's as beautiful as I am tonight. It's been so long since I've done anything with a man. I don't want anything more than to be with us."</p> <p>Our heads snapped together. I pulled away from her, kissing her softly.</p> <p>"Carol, I can't do this for a long time. You have to let me know the truth about myself first, okay?"</p> <p>Carla smiled and nodded. I pulled her in for another kiss.</p> <p>"All this will sound crazy, except that we don't have to stop on our own," she said, her blue eyes sparkling. "I just want to be with you."</p> <p>"You don't have to be in a hurry to come here," I said, rubbing at the bruise on my cheek.</p> <p>"I want to," she said, pulling away. "I'm just not ready yet."</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I said, my words muffled against her ear. "I thought you might never get me back."</p> <p>"I'll come back to you," she whispered. "I want to come back."</p> <p>We held each other as we drove home. I put my arms around her back and she leaned her head against my shoulder. Our kisses were hot, urgent and desperate. I could feel the dampness of her arousal as our bodies rubbed together in the cab, and I realized that it was becoming difficult to contain the fact that a woman was my mother the whole of the world.</p> <p>"I need this," she whispered. "And I want to do this."</p> <p>"And I want you to," I agreed.</p> <p>We pulled into the driveway and hurried inside the house, stopping only briefly before we went in the direction of the stairs. I turned to Carol, our faces level with each other. She smiled, and leaned her head back to kiss me. Her arms slid around me, pulling my face to her mouth for a deep, sensuous kiss.</p> <p>We broke the kiss long enough to look at each other. We were both panting heavily, and the look of lust in our eyes told us everything we needed to know.</p> <p>"I'm not ready," she said, with a husky tone.</p> <p>"I know," I said, my chin resting on my upper lip. I reached down and slid a finger along her neck, sending an electric shock through her body.</p> <p>"We'll have to take care of that later. Right now," I said.</p> <p>The look in Carol's eyes was devilish and dangerous.
