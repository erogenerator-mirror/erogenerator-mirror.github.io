She sits on the couch and motions for me to sit next to her.</p> <p>She picks up the remote and hits a video. "Let me watch this for a while and I'll show you a little more of my game."</p> <p>I sat on the couch looking between her beautiful green eyes. Her sexy lips curled into a sexy smile, like a beautiful cat.</p> <p>"Let's start," I say, breaking the ice.</p> <p>Came on it is, right after the action in the first DVD - my dick grew painfully hard as I looked at it, which was only barely in the way when she put her glass down.</p> <p>I watched her hands go through a little of the wine, and then the soft light of her cigarette and the music. She lit the little clip and it fell into her lap. Her hair was pulled back and her face and arms were just right, but her body was a little more toned and feminine than anything else I had ever seen. Her dark brown hair spilled on the pillow at her feet. We watched the movie together as I played with her hair, trying to make her feel happy.</p> <p>"Is it what you think?" she asked, taking a sip of her wine.</p> <p>"Uh huh. My wife does."</p> <p>She smiled at my response. "Are you comfortable with my body?"</p> <p>"You look amazing. I feel great. I have always thought women would be jealous of me. But I never been much of a prude. I love going out with guys but it's like I'm a total slut. Especially right now. It's so hot."</p> <p>"That's great. I bet you like watching a movie?" she said as she put her glass on the table.</p> <p>I took off my shirt, revealing that my body was toned from playing tennis - not just for women, I guess - for years. It had never been done with anyone, but I did like it, so I let it go. It turned me on watching her in that way.</p> <p>"I can show you more," I said, putting down my glass to take her hand. I pulled her onto the couch and we lay on the couch facing each other and started to kiss again.</p> <p>My arms were around her and my hands roamed over her body as we kiss. Her head was on my shoulder. I had my hand wrapped around her breast while I made out with her mouth. She squirmed and pressed her body next to mine. She moaned as if she were having a seizure. We were both naked with a blanket draped over us, as was I.</p> <p>Came some pretty heavy music started to play and I reached for her breast. I kissed her as she was kissing me and I rolled onto the floor in front of her and spread her legs so that my cock was rubbing her inner thighs. Her breasts were on each arm as I reached down and massaged her through her jeans. I slid my fingers under the leg of her pants and found her clit.</p> <p>The kiss was passionate and loud. Her legs opened almost immediately. I slid my fingers out of her and started to rub faster. Her skin felt hot and tingly. It had her already horny. She was in heat. I was going to make her cum hard.</p> <p>She broke the kiss and moved next to me. She straddled my legs as we watched the movie. I kept playing with her clit and she was still horny as hell.</p> <p>"Oh wow. I can't believe you just did that. I mean how could a guy do that? I guess the feeling was mutual. I love rubbing my boyfriends body when I feel that!" she said.</p> <p>"I'm glad you didn't do that. You know I never do." She kissed me again.</p> <p>"But I will do it again... with you," she said as she unbuttoned my pants and took them off.</p> <p>She took my cock in her hands as we watched the movie. Her eyes locked onto mine. It was a look of excitement and desire and love. My cock was hard and hot as she stroked me.</p> <p>"Honey, are you wet?" she said, looking around.</p> <p>"Yes. I'm dripping," I said, as I looked down at her beautiful body in front of me.</p> <p>"Does it turn you on to see me naked?" she said as she got up and knelt on the couch. She pulled off her t-shirt and pulled down her pants. She opened her legs so that I could see her pussy. It was pink and swollen. My breath caught in surprise of her scentâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
