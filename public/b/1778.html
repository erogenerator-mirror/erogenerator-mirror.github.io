What about you?"</p> <p>"I'm not sure how you're gonna take it."</p> <p>The girl leaned forward and pressed her forehead against my neck. The sweat was on my forehead where she kept pressing her hips into me, her warm breath feeling like it made a hole. "Maybe I'll give you a show tonight, but I think I'll just let you do the same thing I did the day before."</p> <p>"I wasn't sure what you had in mind," I said, trying my best to keep from getting annoyed.

"I've got my hands full with work and..."</p> <p>"I love youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
