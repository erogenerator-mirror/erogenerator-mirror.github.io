And now it had become an obsession.</p> <p>*</p> <p>I was alone this summer in Florida. It was sunny and warm, and the sun glowed brilliantly on my skin. I was lounging outside with my sunglasses and a book. Then the doorbell rang. I turned around to see Tom walk out, barefoot, white, and wearing that familiar tight-fitting shirt. I immediately pulled down my swim trunks with my trunks and he stopped dead in his tracks and stared. He saw his own dick and instantly turned to look at me, with his dick standing to attention.</p> <p>"Well, look at that dick, I think all you have to do is put on a little show for me!" I said with a big smile. Tom was a little taller and was even more muscular. I noticed when he came over, he had a bigger dick than me...he must have been twice as thick as me!</p> <p>"Thanks dude, I really appreciate it, and I'm not sure I could do this without you!" he told me, and then he got up and made his way to the front door, looking at me, and a sly grin appeared on his face. "I've got to run, but I'll definitely be back this weekend for good!" he said.</p> <p>"Be careful, and enjoy your free time!" I said and left the room. I couldn't believe I'd just blown my best friend and now his best friend was coming over and doing him again. It was so naughty, but it felt too good to stop now. I got in my car and took off. I wasn't about to miss this any more. I felt like I could feel my pussy on my legs already, and this wasn't like anything normal. It was exciting.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Part Four.</p> <p>Friday 4:00am</p> <p>I felt a little less horny and decided to go swimming that weekend instead of going home and doing my own thing. It had been so long since I had a boyfriend and then I met this guy. I found myself thinking about how good it would be to do some really nasty stuff. The excitement made me horny all over again and I really wanted it again...and it was still only Saturday night as my body was ready to go once again. I had a few beers and then I was ready to dive in for the kill...</p> <p>This time I was alone with my mind as I floated, floating, floating and floating toward the ocean...</p> <p>Part 5</p> <p>I floated to the end of the dock and I looked at myself in the mirror as I took a quick look. I looked like I just completed a swimming test...my body was tanned and my cock was fully erect. And the way that pussy felt, it was definitely turning me on. I looked at my reflection, and I couldn't believe that I was feeling the same way...I just couldn't believe I was looking back at myself, the way I saw myself.</p> <p>I floated in the air and felt the waves rushing in my body as I felt the breeze coming in my face...my hands were on my body...my nipples were sticking out as much as a half-hard erection had. My whole body seemed to be on fire every time I looked. I could feel my dick was harder by the second, as it felt like it was going to go off at any second. "Oh my," I thought to myself as the wave passed my head and I heard a moan escape my lips, a moan that was so sexy. I looked at myself and I couldn't believe what I saw, how my cock was just a little bigger than normal as I admired myself in the mirror.</p> <p>I floated in the air, just as the waves kept crashing all around me. It was like someone had turned the room lights onto and off all at once and it wasn't long before the waves crashed all around me...I looked over and saw the little blue button on my waistband...I looked at myself again as I saw his expression in my reflection. I pulled my t-shirt out from the waistband of my trunks as I took a sip of my drink.</p> <p>"Ahhhhhh!" I moaned out loud as I slid the t-shirt up. The moment I realized he was watching me, my pussy was on fire. I slid my other hand across my stomach as the t-shirt was only a couple of inches above my cock and I looked over at him again as I took a sip of my drink, and my mouth dropped as I saw his face in the mirror, looking back at my. I was shocked; my eyes went from his face to his eyes as I dropped my top back down and stared him in the eyes...I dropped myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
