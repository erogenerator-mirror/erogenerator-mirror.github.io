I don't want to do it alone right now. I don't want to have to be alone anymore."</p> <p>"I already made up my mind, you don't need to be alone."</p> <p>"But I still want to do it alone."</p> <p>"Let me go first."</p> <p>Without thinking he kissed her. It seemed so wrong but his tongue had already penetrated her mouth and he was kissing it gently for some time. He let his hands roam over her body; touching her face, her neck, her shoulders, her breasts, even her thighs. He lifted her face up to look into her eyes and kissed her again. His tongue came to hers and caressed it as the kiss continued. He moved his hands up and cupped her breasts which were still pressed against his chest as he gently squeezed them. He moved his kisses to her lips and they kissed again. Their tongues were entwined again and he kissed her deeper. He slipped off of the table and knelt down beside her so they could kiss each other again. He put his hands under her legs and opened her thighs exposing the moist folds of her pussy. They both enjoyed the attention the other received from his lips, while his tongue found her clit and began caressing it as he pressed his mouth against it and slid his tongue across it.</p> <p>"OOoohhhhhhh. Oh my God, yes, right there, harder. Oh god."</p> <p>She spread her legs wide and they were still kissing as he took his tongue and began caressing her labia. Slowly he slid his tongue inside her and he took advantage of the wetness inside her and began to lick around it as she began to move her hips up. He moved around to where they were and they were once again side by side. They were both on their side facing each other, his hands caressing her breasts and her thighs as he moved on top of her and was inside her slowly. She felt a tingling sensation and was thrilled by his slow movements. His hard cock was touching her through his trousers and he was moving against it. This sensation was new to her and she loved every second of it. His tongue moved around her clit and slid over it as she moaned in pleasure. He moved his way around to where he was at her breasts and began licking them as she raised one hand to caress his face and let her thumb trace his lips. She felt his cock hardening and moving faster on top of her. He moved her mouth so that he could kiss her mouth. He moved his tongue into her mouth and played with hers. They kissed for the longest time. She felt the heat of his body against hers and her own cock got even harder as he felt her breasts pressing against him. Finally they turned their heads to look at each other and saw each other smiling at a corner of their mouths. They kept kissing as his hands went back to caressing her breasts. They were both breathing heavily as he kissed her passionately. It excited her and she couldn't wait to be free from this. Her hands slowly and gently pulled his face towards her. She placed her lips with hers and they resumed their kisses. "My turn to be done, my pleasure is your choice."</p> <p>"Honey. It's my pleasure" as he pulled her hands back in front of him.</p> <p>"I want to enjoy it. It was great earlier, but I want to feel you inside me again. Please."</p> <p>"Yes. Right there, but please come to me, in bed together again."</p> <p>But she felt hesitant.</p> <p>"Well you better have your way with me then. There are a lot of other ways. I just love being with you. You'll see and I'll take care of them and you'll love me when you like."</p> <p>"I want that. I really love you so much"</p> <p>"You're welcome, I'll see you tomorrow. Now we are both ready. If you want it, you're going to take me too."</p> <p>He took her to the bed and kissed her passionately as he opened the buttons of her white sundress. Slowly he lifted her dress upwards as he went. He was delighted when she sat on the end of the bed completely naked. He gazed at her body as she opened her legs as he went between them. She didn't care as he kissed her legs for long time. Her hands caressed his face as he pulled her legs towards him to open them completely. He kissed his way up her body, taking in every inch of her skin with his mouth. He kissed his way back down her stomach feeling her hands in his hair as he went to the top of her legs. He kissed his way up and down her thighs. She had taken care of her hair this morning but this morning she was very relaxed and let him kissâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
