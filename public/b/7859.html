"No! Just go back to working." She had already turned down her panties in preparation.</p> <p>"I'll help you."</p> <p>And she walked out of the room. She took her panties off, threw them in the hamper and returned downstairs. With her panties hanging on a nail, she headed for the sofa, where she quickly discarded her bra.</p> <p>"My god, did I do that on purpose," she thought to herself as she sat down on the sofa next to him. "Was I dreaming?" She felt a little shivers of excitement run through her body.</p> <p>"What did you think I felt?" she asked, "No, that's not what I felt."</p> <p>He looked in the back at her as if he had a gun ready to shoot her. He put his left arm around her, pulling her close and kissed her. He wrapped his arms around her, not trying to put any weight on her, but just feeling her press into him.</p> <p>"Do you feel that?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes," she said.</p> <p>"What did you feel when I kissed you?"</p> <p>"What did I feel?" she asked, "Like..."</p> <p>"Like I wanted to fuck you."</p> <p>"Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you," she said, laughing a little at her own joke.</p> <p>He kissed her again, this time more passionately. It made her even more eager to do more. "Let's go to bed," he said, as he pulled her up and led her towards the bedroom.</p> <p>"What about you?" she asked, turning to face him.</p> <p>"Later. I've got work to do, you've had a long day and I'll be able to entertain you. Let's go to bed."</p> <p>They both sat down on the bed and kissed again.</p> <p>"That was nice. What would you like to do tonight?"</p> <p>"You haven't yet explained to me what you have in mind..."</p> <p>"I'm still thinking about what it was like when I'd done it." He reached over and brushed a strand of hair behind her ear. "I'm sure there's some more to our relationship."</p> <p>"I don't think there will be more," she smiled.</p> <p>They continued to stroke each others faces. "What about the dinner?"</p> <p>"There are lots of other things I'd like to do," he answered. "But tonight is more important to me. What would you like to do tonight?"</p> <p>"We don't have to be...you know..."</p> <p>"Yeah, well, it's your home now." He slid his right hand down her left tit. "And your body is still hard and wanting more. And I would like to have to taste it before I let this thing get away."</p> <p>"Oh, I know. It sounds ridiculous, but..."</p> <p>"But it's not a problem," he said, moving his head down and kissing her thigh. "It's all I've wanted for years."</p> <p>"But I don't think you can just let that thing go," she said. She felt a little guilty for not wanting his prick to go farther with other than a quickie. She knew she had an opportunity tonight, now that he had her, not just to have him do her. "But..." she tried to finish her statement, but he moved his mouth to her neck.</p> <p>"You don't have any choice," he finished her back with a firm kiss.</p> <p>She pulled him closer to her with her free hand and reached down with the other to squeeze his cock. "It's all I've wanted all these years, Daddy..."</p> <p>"I know, baby. I think it's time my little one gets her hands full with you, too."</p> <p>She felt the weight of his chest on her bare tits and looked around trying to see if there was anybody who could see her now. All she could see were the ceiling to the kitchen and the dim lighting of their bedroom. He reached up and pulled her down on top of him again and she kissed him all over, her tongue dancing with his, her hand squeezing his cock, feeling it grow a little more in her hand.</p> <p>She rolled him on his back and pulled his legs apart. "Let me," she said in a whisper. "I just need to do something."</p> <p>And while he did as she asked, she took his prick in her hands and lifted it slowly up and down. It seemed to go on forever, but she eventually had it completely inside her hands and felt it filling her completely, just as she had hoped it would do. She began to move slowly upâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
