She took him by the hand and began to stroke his shaft and rub his balls. All the while, she continued kissing and biting his chest and finally, she began to undo her own dress and bra. She slipped his belt out of the loops and his pants and underwear together, and began to unbuckle his belt. She slipped it from his pants and unbuckled his fly. She pulled it off and off his legs and tossed the garments onto the floor onto a chair. They were both naked; he was still fully clothed. And, she was still as attractive as she had ever been on his arm. His cock came to life and she began stroking it.</p> <p>“My turn.”</p> <p>“That’s ok,” he said, and she dropped to her knees in front of him. With her mouth, she began to suck on his shaft and balls. She loved the taste of himself and she began by taking the first few inches of him into her mouth slowly and then gradually picking up speed until she managed to swallow him whole. His eyes rolled back on his shoulders in what seemed like a trance, but was really just an expression of the ecstasy he was feeling. She continued the motions of her head and, slowly and sensually, she began to suck and lick him faster and harder. His breathing became heavier with each passing minute, and his moans of ecstasy were the only sounds in the room… even though everything else in the house was quiet, there were no loud sounds coming from the room. As she sucked harder, her hand began to rub her clit. She could feel the blood coursing through her swollen cock and her entire body tingled with pleasure. She let her tongue run up and down her shaft, and then up a little further. His body stiffened and she felt him shudder. He erupted his cum into her mouth and she swallowed as fast as she could. Even after she was sure her throat was well watery from her experience with him, she continued sucking. His breathing was more labored now, but he remained silent and still as her tongue continued to work it’s magic.</p> <p>As he recovered, she stood up, and, he followed, with two more erections and a very erect cock to go along with. She lay down on her back… still fully clothed so as not to show him off to him… and he knelt between her legs. She held her legs high in the air so he could enter her and then he began to push his entire length deep into her. Slowly and deeply. With the same rhythm he had made with her pussy it was easy to make love with. In his mind, he was only watching her, as she cried aloud to him and the feel of her pussy gripped and clenched around his shaft. His strokes became shorter and faster as he reached forward to cup her breasts, to stroke her nipples again and again until she began to beg him to come into her. With that final push inside her she squeezed him with her pussy, and he felt his cum begin to rush back through his cock, as he exploded into her. As always with her he fell on her breasts as the final shudders of his orgasm passed through him, one of his hands on her breast, and her on his cock, for she continued to ride him as he shuddered and shivered in her embrace, as he felt himself begin to slip and go limp. Finally, he rested against her as, still joined, they rolled around, him still deep inside her, both of them kissing and touching each other in every way imaginable.</p> <p>After all that happened, they just lay there wrapped in each other’s arms…</p> <p>“I love feeling your body against mine,” she said.</p> <p>He rolled off her, and they stayed that way as he continued pulling up his own clothes…—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
