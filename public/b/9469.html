I said.</p> <p>'You are beautiful,' he said.</p> <p>He held it up again and then leant over and kissed me. Then he began to pull on the straps.</p> <p>'I see,' he said, 'you like bondage stuff. You know I'm not sure about most things.'</p> <p>He took the bag and put it in back of the car and took out a pair of heavy leather wrist and ankle shackles.</p> <p>I felt my pussy lips quiver as he held them out to me.</p> <p>'Open your legs.' I opened my thighs. He clipped the wrist cuffs to them with a quick snap, but not before he secured my ankles to the wall.</p> <p>'I think you like it,' he said, 'I can arrange that a little.'</p> <p>He put the two padded cuffs on my wrists. 'I can tie more if I get you to,' he said, 'do you like it?'</p> <p>'Can... can... can I... can I...?"</p> <p>'Not like that,' he said. He held out the two metal handcuffs. 'This is a gag,' he said with a smile. I bit my lip. He cuffed my hands to the back of the corset and fastened it round my wrists. He kissed the back of my neck.</p> <p>'Ok,' he said, 'ok. You think it's going to go?'</p> <p>'Yes it is,' I said, 'but it's going to hurt. I will be ready to go at any time.'</p> <p>'Let me put these back, honey.' He took out a pair of thin leather blinds. Once they were tight, he fastened my lips and then cuffed them to my ankles.</p> <p>'Honey?' he asked.</p> <p>'Ok. Please... please can I... can I use the... can I kiss you...?"</p> <p>My pussy twitched as the words escaped. He pulled the blinds behind me, fastening them to the back of the corset. As he adjusted them, he gently caressed my clit gently, but firmly. I closed my eyes and I felt the warmth of his mouth on my neck - his tongue exploring my flesh.</p> <p>I felt myself growing hotter. His fingers caressed my breasts as he massaged the sensitive flesh. Suddenly he moved his mouth away and began to unbutton the front of my gown. I felt the wetness of my sex, which was growing in my groin. I felt his warm breath on my neck. He began to kiss my breasts, trailing his lips down my body as he removed my gown.</p> <p>I felt dizzy even with the blindfold on. He ran his hands up and down my body. He pushed the blindfold off of my head. My mind was racing and my knees felt weak. My cunt ached.</p> <p>'There,' he said. 'now you can kiss me.'</p> <p>He stood at the foot of the bed. I felt myself being pulled gently and then my face being kissed. I heard a click of latex and felt two pairs of hands spreading my inner labia. My body was being touched. My heart raced and I groaned with pleasure.</p> <p>Then I felt what I have always come to believe. I felt my cunt open. I felt the thick latex as my labia was rubbed deliciously against the top of my cunt. It felt so good. I wanted to be fucked. I wanted to fuck myself.</p> <p>I felt his lips on mine. I opened my lips. I felt his tongue running against them and then I was sucking on him. Soon I felt him as his cock was rubbing over the lips of my pussy. I felt him enter me. I felt him start to pump slowly and then suddenly feel his hot, hard penis sliding in and out of my pussy.</p> <p>I heard his voice in my ear as his hips ground against me. I felt his breath and saw that his penis was almost completely inside me, then the head was hitting my cervix. I felt his balls slap against me and he was pounding up into me with all his weight, but he was relentless. I felt his hot cum inside and then as he pulled out, I felt his lips on my lips.</p> <p>The Endâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
