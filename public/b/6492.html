She was doing something like a million times, and no one really knew why, if that is possible.</p> <p>When she first heard the phone ringing, it almost felt like everything was happening in slow motion, as if her head had been disconnected from every single second as a person. But there was no time for the emotion to be completely lost, and she felt the weight suddenly sink deeper until it was almost a foot in the air. She was just about to call it off after all, when an electric jolt of sensation rippled through her body, and she lost control completely.</p> <p>"U-uh, ugh, oh god, oh god oh god" her mind was screaming but she ignored it, she didn't want this to end. Her body felt like it was floating on a cloud, it seemed as if every molecule in her entire existence tingled and pulsed away from her and her head felt like nothing else could be contained. She started to moan, no sounds could fit in, and it was a silent scream. She couldn't even remember when she came, and the entire room seemed to be just blank for a moment like it's a million years old ghost or something. And then her whole world turned upside down and everything in between her clothes flew all around her.</p> <p>The whole time the buzzing was going over her head and everything around her disappeared and the only thing she could see was the black sky outside. Her mind felt a jolt of electric energy running through her body from her head to her toes and then she thought her brain would explode. Her whole body was in a white haze, but her head was the only thing that mattered at that moment.</p> <p>When her body stopped convulsing, she felt like a puppet in a puppet show. As her thoughts and head moved into a state where nothing else mattered, and everything was a new sensation like nothing else could matter, she felt herself drifting back towards the center of everything. She was finally able to get enough strength to focus and she was just out of sight for a few seconds. Then she got back to the present, and the room was filled and light again. She didn't know where she was. Was she in a dream? Who was this woman who had come to live in her home? And then suddenly she felt the room spin, and before she knew it somebody was calling her name.</p> <p>"I've been waiting for you" whispered the voice in her head. Her voice sounded foreign from a distant distance.</p> <p>"I'm here" she whispered back and the voice again sounded foreign. As she opened her eyes, she found she actually was in her own living room, and only her eyes were really that dark. She could hardly see a person through the darkness. The first thing she heard was her name, and then it made her feel like she really was out cold.</p> <p>She turned around only to find herself looking at her own living room. This time however, her eyes seemed even more beautiful. She wasn't standing alone in the middle of her living room, or even the floor. A woman was sitting in a chair near a coffee table wearing only her stockings and a pair of dark shoes that matched. Her breasts were completely exposed, and they were large enough to look down at you without making you want to. She looked so young, her nipples were erect and large, and her legs were slightly parted, and the only thing keeping her legs together was the thin cloth covering what was clearly a wet patch of her wetness. She had a perfect, full figure with a narrow waist and an hourglass-shaped backside. The woman on the chair was dressed in a white blouse that clung tight in all the right places. The skirt wasn't very short, but it was very short, and was long enough to conceal a pair of black and white stiletto heels. The woman looked like she was walking in her high heels, and the heels clung and strained against her legs as they moved. And the way they moved, they seemed to be made of a satin smooth substance of sorts, and somehow every movement was just as she wanted it to be. And in a way, it felt as though she was standing in the middle of her living room, naked except for the thigh-high stockings and the heels. The legs that stood above the right ankle, with their sheer white legs went all the way up to her feet.</p> <p>Her eyes widened at the sight before her in front of her. Her eyes were so bright, even her whites seemed to shine all around her. Her hair was wild in fact, and she had let it fall over her face in the middle of the night when she was in the middle of the night. Her eyes had a glow that she had never seen before. They seemed to have a strange intensity, like they were going to explode out from the deep blue poolsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
