I whimpered, my hand covering my mouth. The man in me was so close to climaxing and he was so big. My legs began shaking and I began trembling again. My whole body wanted his cock inside me, I wanted it in me, but, with his cock just barely penetrating my opening there was no way I could even have said that. It could easily take me, but maybe I wouldn't.</p> <p>"Are you OK?" The man in me asked again. It took a couple of moments for my eyes to focus, as I finally managed to make my way forward and he slid out from between my lips.</p> <p>"Oh, OH GOD! Oh, I'm such a slut!" I whimpered. I tried to pull away, but he just held me still.</p> <p>He stared deep into my eyes, then, with out a word, he leaned into me. I could feel his lips on the inside of my cheek as he kissed me and I opened my mouth. His tongue pressed hard against my lips and his hands went to the back of my head.</p> <p>"Are you ready?" He whispered, his breath hot on my skin. It was so erotic, the hot scent from his breath, the feel of him.</p> <p>I was not sure if I could. I don't know if I would have gotten away with it in the heat of the moment. I nodded my head.</p> <p>There was a pause for a few seconds. "You are a naughty girl," Was all he said. "You need some good hard fucking in your very wet little cunt. Go get on your knees." I quickly obeyed.</p> <p>"No," He said, but there was a strange tone in his voice, but it was so clear. "Get the lube off the night table and go get on your hands and knees." My hands trembled at the thought of him taking me this way because I knew he was watching, and because it would have made me so hot.</p> <p>I quickly turned and got onto my hands and knees, trembling with excitement. I spread my legs as he came up behind me and ran his hand over my ass. This felt so erotic, a little bit naughty, just the tiniest touch of his touch. It made my clit tingle. He moved his hand down over my sex and up to my breasts. With his fingers, he gently rubbed my nipple. All I could do was shiver. I had never been lubed up. It felt so good, so exciting, so sexy. He slid his index finger up and down my slit, starting just above my opening and going the whole way down, touching my clit. Suddenly he slid his finger into my hole, pressing down on my clit and making my hips rise. His finger began rubbing against my outer lips, teasing my opening.</p> <p>I was surprised at just how intense I was at the very idea of his finger inside of me. I wanted it so badly. I could feel his finger gliding in and out of my opening as I rocked back and forth from his expert finger fucking.</p> <p>"You like that?" I whimpered.</p> <p>"Oh, Yes!" He said. His finger was pushing its way in and outside of me. I was trembling from the excitement and the shame of being taken this way, but I could hardly believe it.</p> <p>I leaned back on my elbows and he grabbed my hair to turn around so I was now kneeling on the floor in a big corner of our living room. He knelt behind me and his cock was touching the outer lips of my vagina. It was so hot against me it was like being in heat. It was so wet. At the same time, he began to rub the head of his cock against my lips, brushing one finger across the tip.</p> <p>All of a sudden my head came up off the floor. All I could do was shake and scream at once, at the total invasion, in one fluid movement, at the sudden and unexpected pleasure of his cock in me. I was a prisoner. The only thing that could stop it was the word "No."</p> <p>I was so turned on. His cock was pressing against me, so hard. He slid in me, I spread my legs a little and he slid in me. I could feel my canal start to squeeze him, I could feel every little little inch of his cock. The sensation was indescribable. So different from a finger or anything else that had made me feel that way. He pulled back a little and then slid forward, his cock pushing against my opening until it stopped again. My walls were clenching around him, pulling him in slightly. He pushed in again, and once again, the feeling was a whole new level, as he slid into me, deeper within. He started rocking his hips again and again as he continued to push his cock home, stretching me.
