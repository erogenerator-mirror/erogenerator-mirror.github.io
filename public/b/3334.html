I smiled, "and it doesn't happen often, but to have my husband to make me pregnant is pretty damn big. He's a wonderful father, but I'd hate to have him find out, he'd be just as bad as he is! Just go to your room and try to calm down." Her voice was so soft I felt almost overwhelmed with emotions, the need to comfort her was soothed by her warmth and love. As with some young women, a voice in my mind said "don't worry about it too much, just focus on her, it'll be fine." So, I gently took the words from her and started kissing her forehead. She closed her eyes as I kissed her again then sat up to look at her. We looked at each other, deep in thought, then I nodded and she grinned. I was so happy for her, she was a woman of many talents, there was not a single one of the hundreds she knew I couldn't cope with, in fact I couldn't remember any of them at all, I was more worried about how those feelings would turn out as it would change us as a couple. "You know where to get me some Kleenex?" she asked, she ran her fingers over the sheet on the bed. I got down and got her some of the wipes, then turned to her and looked her up and down. She sat up, and I wrapped her in my arms and laid her on the bed. Then I got on the bed again, I kissed her lips but this time I wasn't passive and continued kissing her as I unbuttoned her shirt and slid it off her shoulders, I could feel her nipples hardening beneath the thin cotton covering as I moved my hand to her firm stomach. When my hand went under her bra to her breast, she opened her eyes. "Oh, I want you again!" I whispered as I slid the bra off her breasts, and her hands went to where I had placed them with the shirt, she unbuttoned it slowly, as I kissed her again I felt her hands rubbing my cock and balls. I pushed her onto the bed and she sat up and got on top of me, she slid her lips down mine and started rubbing her pussy on my shaft, the feel of her pussy on me was wonderful, it was wet enough though, I needed more. I started kissing her again and as we made out I pushed 2 fingers into her, she went crazy, she started rocking her hips up and down, rubbing herself all over my cock and balls. This was the first time she had been completely filled and ready, I could tell her first reaction was to cum, she lifted her hips up with each deep thrust. Now, we were in the dark, we couldn't see, what we did was something we both wanted, and I was happy to do it, I just laid there and watched her fuck me. Then, I could feel her hands on my ass, I knew it was from both ends, her fingers were pulling my cheeks apart and I felt her hot breath against my ass. Her tongue and mouth explored as she licked my ass, finally she kissed her way from my balls to my cock, and I could feel her lick some of the pre-cum that had come out, she went back to take my cock in her mouth, as I held her head down at first I could tell my cock was in her mouth, then she took me back in. While she bobbed up and down on my cock, she was moaning and whimpering as she worked on my ass.</p> <p>I had never been with a married woman, let alone a woman that was so good at sucking cock, but now that she had I liked it. I was so turned on I could feel myself getting ready to shoot off right into her mouth, I felt her take me out of her mouth and stroke my cock some more, letting me know she wanted me to cum in her mouth. It was the most erotic feeling of my life, she was driving me through a fantasy I had only dreamt of for so long. When she let me go, I watched as her hand slowly slid up and down my shaft as I thought I wasn't even going to come, just holding it against the head, but just kept rubbing it as she continued up and down my cock. Then she turned around, laid down next to me and started rubbing my cock between her legs.</p> <p>I pushed my legs up so they were either side her, but had her lay down in case she wanted to go. I felt her fingers touching me as she started sliding her hand up and down my shaft. Slowly, inch by inch she moved up and down, moving my cock on her hand, when I couldn't hold out any longer I started shooting off in her hand, right in front of her face. As she felt it, I let my entire body goâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
