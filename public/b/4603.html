I asked. She was wearing a very short skirt and a button down blouse. It had been at least 4 months since we had seen each other.</p> <p>"Kathy," she answered, "What?"</p> <p>"Kathy - your name. And who are you?"</p> <p>"I'm Karen, and I just arrived from college." She said, extending her hand.</p> <p>I put it to my lips, kissing away the cold and said, "Nice to meet you."</p> <p>"Likewise," she said. "Would you like another drink?"</p> <p>"I'd love one," I said. "This is my third drink, so let's get you started."</p> <p>A moment later, Kathy came back with a small black dildo and an open bottle of Scotch. She handed it to me and added another bourbon.</p> <p>"Kneel down," she said, kneeling in front of me. "Now turn your head."</p> <p>I did as requested and then noticed that she had her back to me.</p> <p>Kathy leaned forward slightly, placing her hands on my shoulders. "Now take off that top," she directed.</p> <p>I knew what that meant, so I unhooked the two small triangles of material covering her breasts. Then I placed the dildo up in my lap, looking straight at her chest. She moved her arms in the air a few times, trying to get comfortable. I put my hand on the side of her head. Her short hair seemed to be everywhere.</p> <p>As she turned her head towards me, I could see the side of her left breast bouncing just a little. The other one also had her arms on her hips. I leaned forward and kissed the side of her neck.</p> <p>"I never thought a woman would kiss a man," I said.</p> <p>Kathy turned her head and smiled. "I don't know about that," Kathy said, "but you have a very nice looking body."</p> <p>Kathy leaned forward and put my ear to her breast. I rubbed my ear against her nipple.</p> <p>"Yes," she said, "I do."</p> <p>My right hand now reached across her body, cupping her left tit. She let out a loud breath.</p> <p>"It's almost midnight," I said.</p> <p>"Let's get rid of the rest," Kathy said, pushing me away. "And we'll get out, I think."</p> <p>So we did. After that, I watched her walk down the hall to the bathroom and disappear. I thought that it was probably the most memorable thing that I had ever seen. I turned to watch her go. She walked right towards me, her hips swaying slightly. I stopped right on the way into the bathroom. Kathy turned around and I watched as her breast swayed sexily back and forth along with her legs. She turned and ran into the master bath. Turning to the mirror, I watched it. Then I began to undress. I took my shirt off and pulled my pants and underwear off and sat on the toilet. With a finger, I began fingering myself. I closed my eyes as images of Kathy in the bathroom flashed through my mind. Then I came.</p> <p>After some time, I stood. I got my penis out and began to stroke it. As I neared my destination, I could hear the shower running in the bathroom. Kathy stepped out and walked into the bathroom, closing the door from the inside. It was still snow, but not as heavy as I had predicted.</p> <p>"Well, are you finished?" Kathy asked.</p> <p>"I'm never finished before," I said.</p> <p>"No. You have a lot of nerve," she said. "I'll get on my knees and help you finish. But be quick if you want to," she said to me.</p> <p>I was naked except for my socks, shoes, and pants. Kathy had already taken off her pants, and was standing naked before me. As I looked at her, she stepped back towards me and reached her arms out, pulling herself into me. I slid forward, pressing myself against her body, feeling her firm breasts and hard nipples.</p> <p>Kathy wrapped her arms around me and drew me in. After a few minutes of kissing, I lifted my hands up to her shoulders, brushing my hands down all the way. She looked into my eyes in the mirror. She moved one hand down to my chest and slid her fingers under it, feeling the underside of my soft skin.</p> <p>"There," she said, "I see you're not too big to be able to take some of my weight," she said, sliding down to her knees. "Let's see how big you are."</p> <p>I felt her slide around in front of me, her face inches from my penis. Her hands wrapped around my shaft, sliding her fingertips down the side. I could feel herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
