I followed his instructions as he did, enjoying the feeling of being exposed for the first time. He helped me remove my shirt, and after he had discarded it, stood up and walked slowly around me, slowly removing his own clothes. I was enjoying what was happening and was becoming excited by the possibilities. I could feel myself becoming very moist and my sex was throbbing.</p> <p>He then kneeled in front of me and as I lay back on the sofa, he began to kiss my stomach and stomach again. He took his time and then moved down to my crotch, starting with my stomach and then moving his way up and down my thighs. He was giving me an amazing amount of massaging oil, he was massaging each leg as he was going, and gradually moving closer and closer to my throbbing pussy. Once he touched me, I felt an electric shock run through my body as I felt him rub the oil into my pussy, his hands went to my legs and he started to rub them as he was rubbing his hands all over my crotch. I moaned in pleasure as his fingers started to trace my outer lips.</p> <p>His hands slid quickly inside the leg-less thong that he wore, spreading my inner lips and running his fingers over my opening and all the way to my clit. I was completely dripping now and he slid his finger into me. He then inserted his finger into my vagina as he continued rubbing my clit. I thought it would seem so weird having a third finger in my wet pussy but there was nothing remotely weird about it. This was a new experience to be sure and I was feeling wonderful. My husband is a fantastic lover, having sex with many different women but never any real intercourse to see how it feels, but for the moment I thought I knew how it feels.</p> <p>His tongue went down to my clit, gently licking it just where it meets my lips. He flicked it slightly as I moaned, then slid another couple of fingers into my wet pussy. I was on the verge of orgasm again and he sensed the approach.</p> <p>He continued licking and I felt my juices begin to flow. He slid his fingers into me and I felt a strong orgasm ripple through my body. I could feel my legs start to tremble slightly. With his fingers still inside me, he got up and straddled my waist. He pressed his cock against my stomach and began to rub it against my stomach. I began moaning and felt the cum begin to build inside me. "Oh Yes...Oh Yes," I moaned as I felt my orgasm start.</p> <p>My husband continued to rub his cock against my stomach while continuing to rub my clit. My orgasm began to subsiding as I finally had to pull him off my body. I felt a tremendous sense of satisfaction from being able to have sex with two men at the same time.</p> <p>He reached down and slowly moved his thumb into me. In spite of the heat of the moment his body felt hot as if it had been hot for decades. It felt wonderful to have his cock in my hand and his thumb working on my clit. He was still massaging my clit, and I could feel how wet I had gotten even in spite of the erotic situation I was in. My husband stood up and positioned himself where he could enter me.</p> <p>Looking straight into my eyes he said, "Are you comfortable?"</p> <p>"Oh yes", I said nervously. My husband had a long penis and was able to pound away, but in the heat of the moment it was very different that the feeling of a cock. My husband's cock felt bigger than average and felt as if it might split me in half or something. I wanted him to fill me again, and I told him so. His cock slid in and out of me easily and with incredible speed. I could feel it hitting all the right spots inside me and feeling the head press against the back wall of my vagina.</p> <p>I couldn't remember my husband's cock ever feeling this good, and this time was very different. It felt different but so good. We were both very relaxed, our bodies perfectly synchronized as he thrust in and out of me. He would press just the tip against my G-spot in a circular motion as I did with my husband, and this time it was going the long distance. We were becoming closer and closer to orgasms.</p> <p>Suddenly my husband's cock exploded. He yelled something and started to cum, sending his liquid into my pussy.</p> <p>He had no intention of cumming inside me as it was going to take a little longer for both of us to reach orgasm together. I was very aware of his semen inside me and he seemed to be enjoying himself immensely asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
