Would you like that?"</p> <p>"I'll give you a raise for that."</p> <p>"Anything, if you must."</p> <p>With that, she reached up and pulled my face down to hers to kiss me. Her breath was hot on my lips as we kissed. I could feel her breath on my face. I felt so much more comfortable if I let go of everything else: my clothes, my clothes, my clothes. I relaxed and kissed her back.</p> <p>"I want more."</p> <p>"You can't even imagine what it will be like if I can be with you."</p> <p>"It's possible."</p> <p>With that, she stepped back, dropped her slippers and stepped out of them. I felt my heart skip a beat, my heart beating faster; she looked beautiful. I stood back, admiring the view.</p> <p>"Wow."</p> <p>"Do you know your way around a woman's body?"</p> <p>"What you haven't done is lick your own pussy."</p> <p>"Well, I'm not sure that's what I'm looking for."</p> <p>She had an evil smile and I could see what she wanted. I thought it might lead to something when her foot stepped away from behind her.</p> <p>"No. I'm here for you."</p> <p>So I wasn't the only voyeur here.</p> <p>"I don't think we have much to show for you. Now is a good time."</p> <p>She stepped out of her shorts and stepped into the water. I saw her naked legs and her perfect heart shaped ass. There were so many ways in which I could see her, see what she appeared to be like.</p> <p>She turned and swam away, with me following her close. I could clearly see her pussy, smooth and shaved. She reached back and pulled me toward her and I put my hands on her ass. It felt so soft. She kissed down to my neck, then my chest. She pulled up my shirt and my undershirt and it was off. Her eyes were in charge of me. She had such a wonderful power over me. She pulled down my undershirt to the floor, then I heard the sound of the water falling. In about a minute she was back in the water. This time, she did not have my shirt completely off. She did not bother with a belt. She removed my belt as well, and when she pulled down my shorts, her mouth and hands made slow, leisurely movements. I just stood there, enjoying her beauty.</p> <p>At this point our kissing was more of a sensual passion. I ran my fingers through her hair, then into her hair. I wanted to do things with her again. But I had to wait a while.</p> <p>She stopped suddenly and I knew I had to return the favor before we could truly begin. I took her hand and led her up the steps to the bed.</p> <p>She stepped behind me and ran the hair hair of my balls over my nipples for a second, then she slipped her hand between my legs and rubbed my clit. The feeling was so good, and she knew it just from the way I could feel it. It would have been so easy for her to be gentle and goad me with her body to be pleasurable. But I needed to feel her.</p> <p>This time, I sat on the end of the bed, on my knees and held both of her hands just above her head, while pulling my body toward hers. I kissed her neck, and down to her shoulders to her arms again. I felt her hands caressing my body, sliding over me. I reached below me and touched her labia. They glistened between our fingers and I pushed a finger in. I didn't use an orgasm control technique. I knew I could keep things in this position. I needed to enjoy myself if I had any left.</p> <p>There was one thing I remembered about my body: that feeling of pleasure as you push your finger into yourself is always the perfect combination of two things. It was the one thing that I was totally dedicated to, and I needed that. All of it. I loved to watch my face, to feel my hands on my body, to rub and feel my hair on my hands.</p> <p>Finally, I found a rhythm.</p> <p>I was a little uncomfortable by the time I entered her. She was warm, moist and soft. It was like opening a door with a light on.</p> <p>"I have to have you right now."</p> <p>She wasn't in the moodâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
