I had a bra on and no panties. I was already horny. Before we left the hotel I opened my purse for my wallet and made sure there were no bills. After I left the hotel a guy came up and said, "You shouldn't wear a condom when you do it," and that I had to keep it at home, so we went off to the bar. I was so turned on.</p> <p>When we got into the hotel I stripped off to my bra and panties and walked over to the chair where the guy was sitting, took the condom off, and put it on. I was ready. I took his cock in my hand and moved it to the groove of my pussy. My whole body went stiff as I put my hand on the shaft, put some saliva on it and put the condom on to. I kept stroking it. I looked over to him. He took his jeans off and sat down on the chair. I took my pants off as well. I spread my legs, took his cock in my hand, put some spit on it and put some on his asshole. I pushed my hand into his ass. He told me I had to take his mind off his own cock so I didn't think about all those nasty things that just happened.</p> <p>After a couple of minutes he came in me. We rested for a minute then he took the condom off and put it on. He moved between my legs and put himself on top. He put his cock into my pussy and I started to move with him. We began a slow fucking. I liked it. He went slow but soon made it faster and faster. We both were breathing hard and our tits were swinging and his fingers were in me. I was so turned on I knew I was going to cum. I started to squeeze his cock with my pussy muscles when I felt his cum in me. He didn't give me much time to recover, he started to move faster, he was coming, he was filling my pussy with his cum. I felt that all too familiar feeling of warmth on my pussy when my own pussy flooded me with warm feeling that felt incredible in my own pussy. The warmth lasted for a minute then we both turned to each other and we kissed.</p> <p>We both got up, went into the bathroom where I took all of his cum in my mouth. Then I got soap and shampoo, washed his cock and balls and then I lubed myself up and went back into the bedroom. We all washed off. He took the rubber off then, he turned me over. He put some KY Jelly on my ass and then put some on his dick. After he put him in me he said he wanted me to bend over the foot of the bed. I didn't care. In a second he was in me. This time it was slow at first, but it felt marvelous. He was going in and out slowly as he was coming up and pulling out and pushing back to get the last push. It felt wonderful.</p> <p>We lay there for a minute talking, his hand sliding over my naked breasts. He leaned over and kissed me.</p> <p>I said, "You know I'd do it again."</p> <p>He was right, that was the next morning. He still wanted me, but we hadn't even touched. Just kissed and touched each other.</p> <p>Later I showered, and changed and went downstairs. I was still naked and he was still dressed. We talked on the couch. For some reason I think I'd gotten control. I was feeling horny again. I said, "I'm very horny, and we can't do anything."</p> <p>He smiled and said, "I'm happy for you."</p> <p>We laughed and he said, "I think we both know we can't do anything."</p> <p>I grinned and said, "What do you mean?"</p> <p>He said, "I want to make you feel good so we can make love often, but it wouldn't be just for us. It has to be mutual. I want us to enjoy each other's bodies."</p> <p>I had no idea I could have said anything with that one word. I asked him if we could do it again.</p> <p>He told me, "Next time we can make love. But right now we're working, and it would be better if we do it right."</p> <p>I thought I knew where this would lead. I'm so horny it hurts.</p> <p>We slept well that night. I slept late as I'd been up before, but when he did me I was so horny. When I woke up I was naked and he was lying next to me with his arm around me.</p> <p>That didn't last. About one in the morning he said he wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
