"You know, you never know."</p> <p>As they walked to the bedroom, the conversation was lighthearted. All three of them had a laugh before David suggested they have a drink in the back, and then they went to bed. They got under the covers, and lay in each other's arms for some time. Then David suggested that they get undressed, and make passionate love. It seemed that David was ready for this and had been waiting a long time. He asked for the coffee, and coffee was served.</p> <p>"You know, I've never been in a threesome, and I've never even seen any of this, but, well, here you are and I have a feeling you're about to do the same thing." Katie said.</p> <p>"I was just talking to your husband," David said as he pulled her on top of him. "That's just us tonight. But he wants it to go on for a little while. I think we can do it too. Can you do it with Bob?" He asked her.</p> <p>"You got me so hot thinking of what it might be like to see the other three of us together," Katie said to him. "I can't wait." She slipped off of him, and then straddled his legs just inside of hers. She slid into him with her pussy, but the feeling from his cock was different. She felt the fullness of it all, and she also knew that it was more comfortable inside her than when she was with her boyfriend. And, when she thought she was ready, she slid him deeper inside of her.</p> <p>"Oh, Jesus, you feel so good inside me. It's so thick," she said to him.</p> <p>"Are you OK," he asked.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah, I'm OK. I've been fucking Bob this way for years, but he's never had a cock in his hand."</p> <p>"So long ago, how did it feel," he asked. He had not been sure what to expect, but now it seemed as if what he felt for her was coming true.</p> <p>"Like, it didn't hurt, but I didn't want to push it any further because I wasn't sure if I should. But it felt good."</p> <p>"God, you are so beautiful, and so exciting, and so hot," he said.</p> <p>They were enjoying the hot feeling that he had for her. It was all he could take. Then he rolled her onto her back, taking her with him. Slowly they both rose up to her in a sitting position, and then slowly began to move their way toward each other. They stopped at a point where there was just a line. With all of him inside of her, it was almost like they had been doing this forever. It was as if all of their thoughts were just coming from the moment they started. They kissed, and slowly, sensuously, caressed one another. It was so wonderful. And, as they caressed one another, they were kissing and caressing. Finally, they separated.</p> <p>"I love you so much."</p> <p>"I love you, too. We will know each other so well."</p> <p>"What's next," David asked?</p> <p>"The next," Katie said.</p> <p>David got into bed and spooned together with Kat, who in turn was in he arms. His cock was soft inside of her and they began to move. David rolled on top of her and they kissed, and fondled, and fondled. Soon he was ready to move. He began to fuck her. Slowly at first, and then faster and harder. It seemed that it would last a long time. As with many times that week, it seemed that David had no intentions of ever making it last.</p> <p>"Oh, David," Katie cried, "we are going to make love. I'm ready."</p> <p>"But," he began.</p> <p>"But, nothing."</p> <p>David began to move. He wanted to keep going as long as he could, but it seemed to keep slipping away. He was getting close. Then he said, "Kat, it's time."</p> <p>"Yes, lover, it's time. Just stay inside me. Let me know when you're ready." She reached down and pulled his ass up a little.</p> <p>"Oh, Katie, I love you. I've wanted this for so long," he said softly.</p> <p>"Me too," she said. "And more. Keep going, keep going."</p> <p>David was so close. Finally, he pushed in and was all the way in. He pushed out to make sure he wouldn't just slip out, but instead, he kept it all the way as deep as he could. Then, he pulled out slowly and then back in againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
