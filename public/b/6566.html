I didn't know if I wanted to be doing that or not. But I couldn't say anything right now. She continued to suck my cock, her hand rubbing my balls with her other. I started trying to hold my load. Luckily her mouth was nice and warm, so I wasn't able to stop. She didn't stop, but kept sucking me and keeping me hard. I thought it would never end, but my body relaxed. My face felt better, my muscles felt better. My cock stayed hard the rest of the night, but my body started thinking that maybe I should try and get more attention.</p> <p>We laid on the bed that night, her right next to me. I could feel her naked body close to mine. She was just wearing a tank top and panties. Neither of us said a word. We just lay there, looking at each other.</p> <p>She reached her hand down my stomach, right over my cock as she had done the night before. Then she took my cock between her fingers. I could only watch her hand move up and down, rubbing the top of my cock. She closed her eyes and took my dick in her mouth. It felt great, even better than before. Her tongue worked its way up and down my dick, moving across the top, teasing the bottom. Then down my shaft and then all the way back up. The feeling was intense. I had to concentrate on giving her head, for there was no way I was going to last much longer. She just kept on sucking, moving her mouth about and her fingers around my cock. I knew it wouldn't be long, when I felt the first spurt of my seed. It shot straight into her mouth. She swallowed, then started to move her hand. I had only shot one shot, which was a couple of jerks of my body, but that didn't matter. I thought I was going to bust a nut. I didn't think it would happen that way. Suddenly my thoughts were going out of my mind.</p> <p>She reached one hand up to my face and used my mouth to clean up my load from my penis. It tasted like something. My hand went back down. She rubbed her hand all over it for a while, then she just touched it again. I didn't try to hold back. I didn't feel self-conscious about it in my mind. I didn't feel self-conscious about it either. I mean, we had been so close, we knew that this was wrong. We were still too young and still married. We shouldn't be doing this, it felt wrong, but it just felt right too. We were so close! Then her hand was back down again.</p> <p>I opened my eyes, "I'm about to come," I whispered.</p> <p>"Do it!" she whispered back.</p> <p>I didn't move. I thought she wouldn't be doing that. But she didn't just give me a couple of jizz shots. Instead she pulled her mouth up and started using her fingers to squeeze both of our loads. I felt it coming, a lot of squirt, all of it. She kept on squeezing, pumping, massaging, stroking, squeezing. It was fantastic. I really wanted to feel it.</p> <p>I got up, "I'm going to go shower," I told her.</p> <p>I was going to use the bathroom, and she didn't take any of my cum into her mouth this time. She just kissed my lips and took some of my sperm into her mouth, swallowed it and said, "You're not mad?"</p> <p>"No," I lied. "But you're not going to sleep with him," I said.</p> <p>"Yes I am," she said, "It's our wedding night."</p> <p>I just stood there, looking down, my cock still up, I said, "But you can't just sleep with him," I pointed a finger at her, "I don't want to do anything in the back of our lives that you don't want to do. That's wrong."</p> <p>"It's our wedding night," she said, "I didn't expect that."</p> <p>"So it's wrong?"</p> <p>"No" she said. I wasn't sure, "I'm still married."</p> <p>"But you still have the kids," I said.</p> <p>"What are they? Why is that even in my vocabulary?" she said. I was looking back at her face. She just smiled, and she said, "Just because I don't want to, it doesn't mean anything," she finished, "I love Mike."</p> <p>"Well, don't worry about that," I said. "It's all right, it's a secret."</p> <p>"Yes, but itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
