She said, smiling back at him. "And do remember when I said you were a dirty old man!"</p> <p>He was laughing heartily, almost shouting, as he said it, and it made her feel warm inside.</p> <p>She felt herself getting wet between her legs.</p> <p>"You mean 'I'm a dirty old man'?"</p> <p>"Of course, I didn't mean that. I meant what I said. I am!"</p> <p>"Now I understand!" she said, taking his hand. "What else did I miss?"</p> <p>"I said that you're beautiful." He told her, running those gorgeous fingers across her cheek, and she was sure that she was moistening, making herself smile prettily.</p> <p>"I am beautiful!" she told him again, and her heart skipped. She was so happy that he found her beautiful! They looked so much alike, there, together!</p> <p>She was sure that she must be blushing, but they looked so much alike! For him to look so perfect!</p> <p>They were sitting with one of the kitchen chairs, and his arm was behind her head resting around her neck and she could feel his chest with its hard muscles and his hand moving slowly up and down her smooth legs.</p> <p>"So tell me, do you find me attractive?" he asked her, leaning down and whispering into her hair that it was so pretty...</p> <p>She did a double-take as she looked into his eyes, feeling her heart jump again at the thought of being his 'woman'. She was feeling good that he had found her sexy...</p> <p>"I...do!" she said, feeling that her heart was beating faster again. She really enjoyed what he had been doing with her. "Especially when I'm not looking so hard....and I find you so sweet!"</p> <p>He leaned forward in the chair and put his hand outwards. She felt his hand move, gently but firmly across her face, and she could feel that his other arm was moving back down her body. He put his lips over hers and she melted against him, as though they were one. Her heart was beating now too, even though it was difficult to breathe, but she couldn't help it.</p> <p>"Thank you for dinner." She said, smiling as he placed his arms on her shoulders. "If you know what is good for you, thank you! Now I better find out what your problem is!"</p> <p>The wine was having its effect, as the kiss she felt with him had become deeper and more passionate. He was taking his time, so that she could not pull away as his hands moved all over her body, making her tingly all over, as he explored her face and lips. After what felt like a long time, but was in moments, but could only have been a few minutes, he raised his head to look into her eyes and said:</p> <p>"You don't need to go any further than your lips."</p> <p>"What?" she replied, shocked.</p> <p>"The kissing part." He told her, not sounding surprised.</p> <p>"The licking part." She said, feeling a bit of guilt. "But to tell you the truth, I don't think it would feel as good as it really does."</p> <p>"Don't worry." He reassured her. "After a kiss like that, my tongue might not taste as good."</p> <p>"You're serious!" she said, although she had thought it was too soon. "Besides, it seems to me that you like me a lot."</p> <p>She thought about it for a moment. "I like you very much!" she said. "And not the same as my boyfriend."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"You're so handsome..." she said. "And your tongue tastes great!"</p> <p>"Just the thought of kissing you!" he told her, as his hands moved from her shoulders and down her back. "Besides..."</p> <p>But there was a bit more he must have heard in his words.</p> <p>"You haven't seen my breasts yet!" he said confidently.</p> <p>"You're beautiful!" she assured him.</p> <p>Then, his mouth moved down to her breasts, licking them, kissing them. His tongue was exploring, teasing, and she felt it's way down to where his hand was inside her shorts. Her breathing had changed, she could feel it getting heavier and higher and she felt a shiver as that strange feeling ran all through her entire body.</p> <p>"You're not wearing underwear!" she finally managed to gasp his name.</p> <p>"And that's very nice!"</p> <p>"I want to see it!"</p> <p>She looked down and saw that his hard cock was now standing at full salute, and there was a faint trickle of wetnessâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
