She ran her hand along the sides of her thighs and her fingers began to trace her own slit. She had closed her mouth against mine but when the softness of my jaw told her exactly what I wanted, she took it into her mouth and began to suck, making sounds that were unmistakable. I ran my hands up her thighs when two fingers slid inside her easily. The moan she made when I slid the two fingers into her slick center was louder now. Then we were both kissing again, my lips pressing against hers, pressing down with our groins. My penis, pressed hard into the cleft of her ass, was trapped between our bodies and pressing against her pussy lips.</p> <p>She made one more motion with her hips and suddenly rolled to her back, legs spread, and pulled me down on top her. She lifted her arms above her head and pulled me down onto her face, kissing a tongue that darted into her mouth repeatedly to make us both cry out. It was no doubt our first kiss. Our arms clung desperately against each other, but when she let me go, I could hardly hold myself back. I had never felt anything like that before.</p> <p>"Let me taste you!" I wanted to ask but I was too distracted by a momentary stab of jealousy not to ask, especially because she held the conversation away from me for a moment. The two of us came together at the same time, our faces crushed against each other as we breathed in each other's scent. When we came down, she pulled me up into a kiss that I had no doubt was at least as passionate as she had come from.</p> <p>It was as much an expression of affection as my own, almost a gift she could not fail to give.</p> <p>"Come inside me, Daniel," she murmured as we came up for another kiss.</p> <p>We came up for a quick kiss, a long embrace, and then she drew me back toward her, guiding me into her body. I slid into her as deeply as she held me, not wanting to hurt her, but neither of us was sure what would result if the evening did end this way, but our lust-wracked expression made us want to do it as much and more as possible to be together. She rolled to her back and I took her face in my hands; our lips joined again and as we felt our bodies begin to melt into one another, the softness of our bodies and our sighs and moans of pleasure mixed together to add to our already perfect union.</p> <p>It was a perfect ending to my long and torrid lovemaking and I could feel myself growing hard again and when she pushed me off her that time it was all for naught. For many minutes, she held on to my neck until her breathing slowed again and she looked up into my eyes, her hair tangled in a pony tail.</p> <p>"I'm hungry," she muttered. "We have more than one dessert to make."</p> <p>And so I carried her to bed and spent the whole night there, naked and ready.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>I was feeling guilty about the evening's events. I'd been in an emotional fog, partly because I'd wanted to get to this point, partly because I wanted to be sure it wasn't all a drunken dream, but I had no idea how to proceed, even though I had wanted to be with the woman of my dreams ever since my early childhood, the last few nights together of which I had been on the receiving end of the most loving and affectionate attentions with whom I could honestly express myself. I was not sure how to proceed with the aftermath; I found myself hoping it would be me that would say the words. Even so, I somehow feared it would be me that would end in some form of reconciliation with her, not just to be able to continue our relationship.</p> <p>But the evening had gone differently than I had anticipated. Instead of coming over for the night, we had gone over to my brother's home at the time, where we had some very nice food delivered to us, some of our old, old-fashioned candles going out in the background. When our meal arrived, we were in the living room where a small candle and some matches had remained, and were sitting on the sofa with some other people watching us eat, both of us watching what was clearly an extremely interested and obviously excited man. To my utter disappointment, he hadn't even seen what he had been seeing and now I knew.</p> <p>"Dan, do you love me yet?"</p> <p>Neither of us said what we wanted to do next. I was afraid I'd either say something else that wasn't fair, or say something else that might get me kicked out of their apartment or worse—that I couldn't bear to see again—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
