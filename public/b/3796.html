"This is nice. I like a nice woman to feel happy. I like that feeling. Can I suck you?"</p> <p>He took several seconds to reply, as he had done a lot of what his mom said.</p> <p>"I was thinking maybe I could feel your cum in my throat and taste you."</p> <p>"Sure you can taste. Go ahead. You don't really have to do anything because you don't have to do anything but enjoy yourself."</p> <p>"Really? But I really want to make you feel good." She felt the first rush of hot cum enter her mouth. As he was putting it in her mouth she could feel her juices coating the shaft of his cock as she took it in and out a few times as they talked.</p> <p>"Are you ready to go back to bed?" He asked her as was the first time they spoke about it.</p> <p>"Oh yeah. You get up and I'll see you in a few." She said, as she grabbed the robe from the hook and walked into her bedroom with it. She stopped at the closet again and pulled a small bag of clothes into it. She closed the door and walked back into her bathroom. As she sat down onto the toilet she looked at herself. First she was glad to see her dark brown hair was still damp from her shower but that was gone at the moment. Her breasts were large and firm with small perky nipples which she didn't put much effort into, as usual, but they would always be hard, if she could get a grip on them, and they also had that kind of bounce when she walked. She also wore a very transparent bra that did make her breasts look very nice. Once she sat down, she turned on the shower and waited for it to warm up. It did warm up a little, but she was not interested in being embarrassed in front of him. She liked it when he would tell her this had happened or when she would be upset. When the hot water hit her it was good. She enjoyed his reactions and smiled when he told her she looked good in the shower.</p> <p>She was sitting in the hot shower stall washing her hair when he approached in his robe. He looked at her and her breasts almost as if they were not being held in check. He slowly walked up toward her with his arms wrapped around himself and then he wrapped them around her, his warm body in her back. Both were soaping up and washing each other. As he did this he leaned over and began kissing her on the cheek and then on the lips, which she responded to, but not too. He could still taste some pre-cum on her lips, but he did not stop.</p> <p>"What is your name?" He asked as he was kissing her.</p> <p>"Betsy." She replied honestly. She loved their friendship and had always felt like things were different from anyone. Then she realized she would be married, especially because she had decided not to do it.</p> <p>"I understand," he whispered. He looked at her and then looked back up. He lowered his head and started to kiss and play with her. She moaned as she had not been able to last more than a minute after his lips got there. He was licking from her lips all around and down to her neck as her back arched.</p> <p>Her hands moved to his back and began running all over. He took her hands in his and pressed downward and he could feel the muscles of her hands as she moved them in his back. He looked up at her and she closed her eyes and moaned again. As he was looking at her he leaned forward and kissed her again on the lips which she responded enthusiastically into his mouth. He placed his hands on either side of her neck pushing her down so her head was off balance and her face rested on the wet, slippery soap-slit and then he kneaded her soft, sexy globes and rubbed and rubbed in little circles.</p> <p>He took them both into his mouth and began to suck one, then the other into his mouth as he pushed back in the other one for the second time, which made her moan louder. She was wet and ready and he knew that with just a little effort. He took advantage of the moment and slowly moved one hand to her left thigh and he placed the other hand on the top of her bikini panties and slowly slid his hand up her leg. When his hand touched her clit, she jumped a little and pulled her leg higher up. He knew exactly what she wanted and what her body told him. As his fingertips began to slide inside her sopping panties he began to kiss and explore her left side. He moved along the outside of her thighs, up one to the outside and down to the outside again using just the tips of his fingers and the palm of his hand. He began to slide one finger inside, moving it in small circles, as his otherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
