I'm no bigger than average," he said.</p> <p>"So what do you do when life is full of people doing exactly what you want? You do a lot of work; but in your personal life too. And that involves all of us."</p> <p>"And to top that off I get a lot of personal attention. Which helps me make my company better, which helps me get a decent pay raise, which allows me to focus and keep my focus while having fun."</p> <p>"Are you happy here? It is all very well with the world, but that will change in two or three years," he stated.</p> <p>"It isn't that it matters," she explained. "My family is all very conservative, so I'm not ready to be one of those. But that will change over the next week or two. We're not going to get the upper hand this time."</p> <p>"No worries about that," he said. "I can go on, but I want to talk to you in person. It is important to tell you the whole story."</p> <p>"That's great," she said. "Come back here and I'll meet you here in the office tomorrow."</p> <p>As he hung up Mike was feeling a little out of breath and very tired. "I'm going to bed," he said as he went into the house. "I need that good sleep."</p> <p>As soon as Mike was dressed he turned the doorknob and walked out of the front door. He walked to the front desk and called for his boss. He told him the deal and he left a short message. The message said, "Thanks, you have my congratulations on this deal."</p> <p>Mike smiled as he thought about it and said, "I have no idea what your boss thinks about any of this. I have to warn her something that will tip her hand and probably tip her off. She still owes your company a lot of money, but what will it take? I'm guessing $50,000. How in hell will it look to some, but your bosses are right, even your bosses like to think they can get away with it. You are on."</p> <p>As he said the word "boss" Mike saw tears in her eyes and she had no reaction on his end. The smile he was giving her turned to anger. "There is no way you can tell that you are my boss," he told her. "You have a big mouth anyway, so there will come a time when you are ready to say something that will scare you. It's what works. But you can't come after me for not doing my job." As angry as he was with her, he wasn't.</p> <p>"What do you think I will be doing if I do come to Chicago with $50,000,000. That will be overkill," Mike said, "and in the case of your boss you won't even have the respect you are due to you. I don't think that we will even be in any position to argue the merits of the deal. You may be able to get a lot more of what you need and I will make sure that your boss is pleased with it."</p> <p>"You're crazy," she whispered, "but it's going to be good if I can keep up." Mike smiled and walked to his desk. As he handed her his new business card, he said, "It's time!"</p> <p>Mike walked to the door and said, "You have two hours. I mean that."</p> <p>As she walked past her desk and out the door again she wondered what she would get if he came up with the $5000.00 proposal. The idea of seeing his boss with his hands full was just too fucking tempting to be the kind of thing to pass up. And that wasn't all that she was concerned about, she thought. She had enjoyed his business, so to have a lot of money made for nothing was about as much fun as it had been for her the first time she had seen him at the New Year reception. As soon as she made her decision, she went to the door, and locked it. On the one hand it was a great thing because it paid her a lot of business, but on the other hand it was just crazy to keep it all under a thumb. She sat there, trying to decide for herself what if anything else she would do if it happened, but all the same, this was a good time to do it.</p> <p>As she looked at him she could see the worry she had felt at the meeting coming, but she also saw it as an opportunity to put a damper on all of this. If she did go to him with this business deal, then she would start over with a good time. She was already making the decisionâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
