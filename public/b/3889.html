But first, we have some unfinished business I need to finish." I said as I reached for a beer. I turned and bent over towards you. When I reached you, I looked you over as you stood looking at me in surprise, with one last glance down at my breasts.</p> <p>"I was hoping for something else, but I guess it won't be much longer... just a little more time!" I smiled at you seductively as I took a drink from my beer. As I sat back down in my chair and crossed my legs, I could feel that your eyes are drawn to my crotch, giving it a little extra push, but not too much more than it already was. I felt my nipples start to harden as the thought of what might happen if I leaned forward and took a drink from your drink. You had obviously been thinking this through very clearly, with what the rest of the night had been I didn't know. I smiled warmly at you and asked if everything was all right. You assured me you wouldn't mind if I brought over another drink as well, and the rest of the evening was already looking up. <3 I replied with a small and innocent smile. As I spoke, my thoughts suddenly turned to the night you have been having with me in the back seat of your car, and of how you had been able to drive just this fast without a break. And you were right, I had been having all the fun while you still lived in the house, the house not only was far from your garage, but far out of the city, as well, so this whole experience came as no surprise.</p> <p>While you were chatting, me and the others had already moved back to the pool. A few minutes more and I knew that you were still feeling the effects of what had just transpired. I had a moment of hesitation when I thought about what had just happened, but then you pulled up beside me and told me I might not remember that the first time it happened. I looked at you confused, and smiled knowingly in reply.</p> <p>We continued to walk down the back of the house with our conversation. I was feeling very horny as the evening had turned around.</p> <p>After several awkward moments of silence, you leaned in to me and we held each other in a tender and loving embrace while we quietly talked the evening's events. While it seemed that no longer an issue of sexual tension between us, I felt the heat of your body, the warmth of your breath on my cheek, and the softness of the touch of your lips. Your breasts felt firm against me, and I felt my penis starting to grow at the feel of it. You reached over and grabbed a glass of your favorite drink for me, and we sat down on the opposite side of the lounger opposite the large Jacuzzi that the spa was providing for it's long stay in.</p> <p>Your feet were pressing into my shin, and it felt as if you were inviting me to slip my own feet around your slim calves, and I did just that. I gently began to run my hands up and down your calves while we talked. I felt your feet pressing into me with each step we took. At first, I started to resist but then I felt your fingers running through my hair and back under my arms. I felt your warm breaths on my face. Your hands started playing with my hair, softly stroking my neck and shoulders along my back, letting your fingers trace around my ear and neck. I felt your mouth move to the small of my neck as you continued to caress me, but you stopped just inside my collar. I felt you nibbling on my neck lightly and then moving away. You stood up and helped me out of my clothes, tossing them into the shallow water beside the large Jacuzzi with your clothes.</p> <p>As we walked up the front steps of the house we embraced, and I felt as if I was beginning a long and slow journey of arousal down into my pussy.</p> <p>"What was all that about?" I asked you as we looked at each other.</p> <p>"You'll have to ask me," you said with a smile. "Did you enjoy it??" you asked me.</p> <p>"Yes," I replied as I leaned into you and gently kissed you neck in response to your comment.</p> <p>"And why?" you continued after we broke our kiss for a second.</p> <p>"It was very nice, it was not so scary that it caused any real pain."</p> <p>"You mean, it was not so bad if you feel that you might be inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
