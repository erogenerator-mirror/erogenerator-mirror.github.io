For the last year it was like they are on a trip. I'm not sure of the itinerary. Maybe even the date."</p> <p>I knew she was not saying goodbye.</p> <p>"I'm going to miss you."</p> <p>"Please, don't do this. Please don't stop. Don't leave me."</p> <p>"I have to."</p> <p>With that she turned on her heel and walked away, taking the door.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>The next two days were uneventful.</p> <p>I did not hear from Cindy, either at home or my office, or in the restaurant. The only thing I did hear was the occasional phone call, but my mind would go on. By lunchtime on Monday morning, things were back to normal. I did not notice that I didn't have a date for the evening. I just wondered about our current predicament.</p> <p>The week went by very well, but before getting another chance to meet and talk with Cindy at work, I was running an errand by myself for Cindy at lunch, on the way out when the elevator chimed. As soon as I looked up and saw that she was standing in front of the elevator with her hand over her mouth, I knew something was bad. She had not said goodbye to me, and I knew what that was about.</p> <p>"Excuse me," I said, "I should have called you on my way out."</p> <p>She let out a cry of despair when I tried to console her.</p> <p>"It's okay," I replied, "I'll get you another dinner."</p> <p>When I got to her office, I noticed a very pretty secretary sitting at her desk. She was older than she looked in the business journal, and she had short brown hair. Her name plate read: SUGAR, just like the article in the business section. I figured she was just doing her job for lunch. I went over to her chair, and sat down in her lap, facing her.</p> <p>"Goodbye," I said softly, "I'll be back around 1:00 a.m. I promise."</p> <p>I did not speak, but the tears started.</p> <p>"I'm sorry!" she cried, tears leaking from her eyes as she pressed herself tighter against me. She was trying to get as far as she could under the desk before she fell back against my chest. I held on to her, and she kissed me fiercely. This was her signal to get back to me. We made love over and over again that day.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>Two days later, I was scheduled for a mid-day rendezvous at a restaurant at 9:00 p.m., but nothing happened. When I finally got the chance of getting there, I walked up to my boss and handed him the check. He took out his handkerchief from his pocket and handed it to me. As I bent to retrieve the check, I noticed he had his hand in his lap.</p> <p>Cindy came up to me.</p> <p>"I know you have no idea of what has happened to me yesterday. It was not one minute of happiness or joy, and it was just yesterday. You have to forgive me. Please, forgive me!"</p> <p>I told her, "I forgive you."</p> <p>She looked at me, crying as she said, "I'm so, so sorry." She had that big smile and a big, happy face.</p> <p>I said, "I'm sorry I put it all on your account. The restaurant is only 30 miles out of town, and I can see nothing. Do you have to go?"</p> <p>She told me, "No. I'll pick you up at 9:00."</p> <p>I thought about calling my dad, to tell him I was spending the day with friends and was just going to go to school.</p> <p>I had gone to my dad's, but I was never home when he picked me up. I had just walked away when the doorbell chimed, and my boss came in. He called me when he saw me.</p> <p>"Denny, is everything alright?" he asked.</p> <p>"Everything is fine, sir. I just ran into Mr. Bickler at McDonald's. He said your boss wanted to have a meeting with him."</p> <p>"So you're a date, huh?"</p> <p>"Yes, sir, I am!"</p> <p>I said, "Have you forgotten that I promised you at lunch that I'm not dating anyone? I'm sorry. I'm sorry," as tears started spilling down my cheeks and down my face.</p> <p>"Yes, of course. I promise. Don't worryâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
