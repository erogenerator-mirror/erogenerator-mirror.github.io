When she finally released the kiss, his heart raced, his palms trembling with excitement. He knew that she still harbored the same deep feelings for him, he could feel it too. But she seemed to be a little unsure.</p> <p>"I'd like that," she said, her eyes flashing. "So would I." The intensity of the feelings were building again, his heart pounding against his ribs. He was still afraid her anger would show too much of a reaction. Yet somehow, the heat was starting to ignite. He decided to try to distract them, to make the moment more pleasant. Besides, he figured if they continued to be the same, he'd have an opportunity to try to get the both of them back to their old lives, to make sure that neither of them felt like they were damaged by his behavior.</p> <p>"Do you want me to leave you then," he asked hopefully, his voice smooth and controlled. He wondered if his tone would cause her heart to skip a beat, or would it come back to bite her.</p> <p>"I know we'd enjoy both of us here," she assured him. "But you said you wanted me to stay."</p> <p>"I want you to stay with me here," he said in a calmer tone. "And I want to hold you like this." His arms hung limply by his side.</p> <p>She pulled him against her, her lips parting in a sultry moan. He felt her breath, warm and intoxicating. He felt her body against his, felt everything that she was doing, all of it. He felt as if he'd lost his mind. It seemed as though eternity had only a moment's pause before she broke away, her eyes full of desire. She seemed to be looking up at him with need; he felt her own need for him. He knew he'd been lucky to be with her.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" she asked, her voice still hoarse with passion. "Because I'm afraid that you'll hurt me," she added, looking at him again. Her eyes held a vulnerability that was a little frightening. "Don't worry."</p> <p>He didn't know what she was telling him, but his heart told him it wasn't what it looked like. If she was telling him he was just being polite, then there was to be no misunderstanding. He had to go along with this. He wanted her more than anything else. He felt as if he'd been holding the world against his shoulders. There would be no turning back after he'd made love with her. He felt as if she was asking him to walk away from them. They had to find someplace to stay that would be secluded. He had always been afraid that if they were going to find a good place in the forest to stay for a little while that he'd lose his nerve or lose his will to be in her presence. But here he was, in bed with her, not going anywhere without her.</p> <p>"I can't believe we're together again," he whispered before he could stop himself. "I felt like I'd been out alone again," he added, leaning in for another kiss, this one softer but still filled with wanton desire. "I think that if we were here, with someone other than you being near," he added, looking into her hazel eyes again. "You're the only one who's here," he told her, his words coming out more quickly. "I want you."</p> <p>"But what does that mean?" her voice was still tinged with panic. But it hadn't been this calm as though she'd been waiting for an answer. "What did I do wrong, what did I hurt you?"</p> <p>He put his arm around her shoulder and pulled tightly to her. "You didn't do anything wrong," he told her firmly.</p> <p>She just nodded, leaning her head against his shoulder. He let his arm drop from her shoulders and rested it on her lower back. He stroked her long silky hair.</p> <p>"I feel like I've lost you," she said. It had been so sudden, too sudden. "We've only been gone a few minutes," she told him.</p> <p>"I can't believe I did that. You seemed so..." He stopped himself from asking the right question. It seemed so strange not to ask the question, let him guess about it, but he couldn't help the embarrassment any more than he could any other man. "I want to go away with you right now."</p> <p>Her face lit up as though it had the sudden rush of joy to see him smiling and relieved. She just nodded, her whole body now burning with a sudden longing. "You're not going anywhere, even if we don't agree to stay here," she addedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
