I want you." I kissed her and started unbuttoning the button between my breasts, while she kissed me passionately again. I pulled her up to me so we were standing in the middle of my living room. After the door closed behind us I put her over the arm of the sofa and started to remove her top. She didn't seem to mind. Once the fabric was out of the way that she could take my bra off. Her nipples were stiff and hard. I kissed her there for several minutes making my body tingle, and before she knew it I was unclasping her jeans.</p> <p>"I want you," she said and pulled her jeans and panties down slowly. She had never shaved her pussy. I couldn't stop looking at her pussy, all soft looking, pink and inviting. I started to touch myself with both hands. "My beautiful lover," she whispered, "I can't wait. I want you."</p> <p>"Let's go upstairs," I said with a laugh.</p> <p>I took her by the hand and we followed her up the hallway, stopping once to kiss each other all the way. We stopped by the bedroom, where we stood together for about fifteen minutes. I was beginning to have an idea of how nice it would be to be inside her, but I didn't want it to be in that position. I was aching to have her on the edge.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want this to go this far?" she asked.</p> <p>"I want to do it again. If you want to. My body told me so that I'd have the biggest orgasm of my life. I want to experience something really special, and for a long time not just for you, but for us as well."</p> <p>"That would be sweet, but I want to do this with you. I want to feel what you feel, and I want to enjoy feeling you. I've never felt this way before. I love making love with you."</p> <p>"I'm not sure I love it, but I think I love it. I want to feel it. Let's be open with each other, let's feel the pleasure build. But we need to go slow. I don't want to rush this. I want to savor the feeling. For you, as long as it lasts."</p> <p>I kissed her and led her by the hand down the hall to the bed. Her eyes were closed, and I could detect her lips slightly quivering. Just at that moment her body was quivering, and she moved slightly so that she could wrap her arms around me and pull me down to her lips with hers. I held her tight to my body. It was the most intimate moment of my life. I know every inch of her body felt like the one inside me was clinging to me like a life vest. My body tenses and the tingle inside I can barely describe started spreading through it. All of my muscles and nerve endings seemed to be trying to get there. Slowly I started to unbutton her blouse, until she unbuttoned it completely exposing her breasts, her nipples pointing hard and hard at me. I pushed her blouse off her shoulders and threw it over the bed, and she unbuttoned my shirt.</p> <p>It was the most erotic feeling I'd ever experienced. I pulled my arms from inside her hair and lifted her lips to mine while we kissed. Slowly I began to caress her back, the undersides of her breasts. Her nipples were erect and dark red from the sensitivity of my touches. I pushed her body down the bed, with my leg between hers. I could feel the heat and heat coming from between her legs. Her pussy was wet and warm, and I slid a finger up and down her slit slowly and with determination until she was almost ready to cum. It was going to be a hard and deep climax.</p> <p>With one last kiss I pushed her back, and she laid down on her back with a satisfied moan. I lay down next to her and pulled her back to me. This time we didn't rush at all, but instead we got bolder, pushing her back and pulling her legs out as she pushed them open. I could see the tiny puddle of fluids just above her pussy. I began to lick her and it was electric. The taste of her was unique, I loved it. I licked and laved her juices hungrily, reveling in the flavor of her and how she tasted, as I was licking, I could feel a tingle that I didn't ever have before. I thought I was going to have the last time of my life, I realized that there is something I have always wanted, but never could.</p> <p>Her hips began to buck upward toward my face, begging me to lick her pussy more.
