I see her tongue, too, run right down the length of my shaft before coming to rest at my balls. She runs her fingers firmly on either side of them. This time there is no hesitation in taking her time with her ministrations. She sucks firmly, pulling every so often from the tip as she does. Her hands move to grip my shoulders and pull me closer, so that I'm pushing forward into her mouth. She looks up, smiling, but looking at me more intently this time.</p> <p>She continues to suck as she pushes me toward her. I can feel the back of her throat touching the top of my penis as she descends, the sensation of wet silky wet warmth running all through my crotch at the top of every descent, up and down. I can feel the beginnings of an explosion starting to form at the base of my shaft. It is not one of my strongest, but she seems to relish the feeling, her lips tight around just the head of my cock.</p> <p>I can finally feel the climax building in there, and I can't hold it back much longer. I moan out, "J, you have to stop," as I start to lose control. I lean forward, still pushing her head down, so that only the head of my cock is in her mouth. I hold it there, letting it slowly run around her tongue as she sucks, trying to draw the entire length of my penis down. I can feel the pressure building, but neither one of us can hold back much longer. I can feel my orgasm building rapidly until she feels me tighten up and relax, pushing forward and back into her mouth. I hold her there, with my entire length inside her, feeling her throat contracting in small spasms. Her eyes are closed, but she feels the pleasure building inside her. She looks me in the eye for a few seconds. I am still holding onto the headboard, but my hips are still pushing back to take more pressure from her. I feel like my whole body is on fire, and feel a wave start to sweep over me. My hips buck a few times and I feel the explosion explode from my head. I hold her lips firmly on the tip as she sucks the last drop from my shaft.</p> <p>Finally, I have recovered to slowly relax her lips on me. I lean forward and lightly kiss her lips, her chin, her neck, and her collarbone before moving down her neck to her breasts. I kiss her softly, my hands massaging her breasts.</p> <p>She opens her eyes. Her mouth opens slightly, as though she's trying to say something. "I've never done anything like this before." I don't know if she's blushing again, or if she just looks relieved. I'm about to kiss away any misgivings about this, but I know she won't mind if I do this in a way that will help her experience an orgasm.</p> <p>"I guess we really should do this someplace else," she says, giving me a pensive look. "I don't know, I guess we've both thought about it."</p> <p>I smile and kiss her. "We have, haven't we? You should. And when you've decided you want to do that, that's no reason to rush back to the hotel."</p> <p>I look to her from the tip of my head to her crotch. "Do that just a little. How was the rest of your day?"</p> <p>"Oh, we had a lot of fun today," she says in return. "You should try it sometime."</p> <p>I move back to lay my head down and close my eyes. I can almost feel my heart slowing down just a little. She is still watching me as I lay there, feeling my hard-on start to move. I think that I'll make her happy if I decide to do this again.</p> <p>I open my eyes and look at her. "So," she says, "you do seem nervous about trying the whole thing and wanting to?"</p> <p>"I don't know, I guess so," I reply. I wonder how nervous, and still unsure to start with, she can be. I smile and nod my heads. "I will try it. I know how to do this."</p> <p>I feel like I'm going to say something else before she does, but I don't change her mind. I feel safe in the fact that she is okay with doing this, even if it means that I might go crazy if she doesn't do it as I wish.</p> <p>"I'm sure you'd like to try it before, but I am sure that you could enjoy it."</p> <p>I see her swallow and smile. "I could never say I didn't want to."</p> <p>She nods a yes and leans in to kiss me again. I think I can taste myself on herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
