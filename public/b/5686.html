I told her. "Do you agree to obey me? I know that you don't but I promise you that it will have the desired effect on you and I will make it a much more fulfilling experience for you. In fact, it might even be even more exciting for you!"</p> <p>I stepped forward again and slid my hand up her thigh to cup her pussy. Her lips were already slick with her juices and I gave them a gentle push. She gasped at the feel of my softness against her as I slid in. I felt her body jump as I pulled back and slowly slid back into her.</p> <p>"Ohhhhhh...." she moaned as my cock slowly pulled out and nestled itself in the crease of her ass.</p> <p>I moved slightly, just barely, to rub around the sensitive spot, her pussy lips pressing against the base of my shaft and pulling slowly.</p> <p>"It's okay," I reassured her. "I know it's not easy for you but you'll be able to handle it." I slid forward again, my cock sliding against her anus.</p> <p>"Oooooooo..." she gasped suddenly - in a dreamlike state.</p> <p>"Remember the sensation you feel coming? That feeling of...the warm, wet sensation that makes you feel like you're...like you're going to be...coming!" I murmured, as I pulled it back out just a little - then slowly slid back in, causing her to moan.</p> <p>"Ahhhhhh...you felt that..." she moaned.</p> <p>Then I pulled back and started sliding back in again... again, slowly...</p> <p>"Oooo....oh...ohhhhh...." she moaned again - almost in a dream.</p> <p>I pulled all the way out again and slid back in, almost totally out - then in again...</p> <p>"Ohhh....ohhhhh...." she groaned.</p> <p>I held just two inches back as she reached back and held her cheeks apart, her pussy lips on full display, and stared down at the pussy of this beautiful woman who I had only just met.</p> <p>"You were so hot honey, I thought I'd cum from feeling you" I said as I slid back in, her lips parting, the warm pussy lips clinging to my cock as I buried it in her. I leaned over and kissed her on the lips, on the cheek, her forehead, her collar bone and the tip of her nose...</p> <p>"I'd love to see you again." I told her as my cock slid out and slid back into her - she moaned her agreement, her eyes looking into mine as I started sliding it in again.</p> <p>I kissed her forehead, her nose, the bridge of her nose and then her lips... Her lips were parted and I slipped my tongue in the opening as I was sliding it back in.</p> <p>"Ummmm" she purred.</p> <p>I kissed her on the mouth again "I think there'll be a lot more to you than that honey." I said to her as she moaned into my mouth.</p> <p>"Mmmmm" she replied "Maybe...maybe you'll let me visit her a bit...?" She said.</p> <p>"Honey, you're too beautiful... I can do that." I whispered.</p> <p>I slipped out of her and went back to where I had been sitting when I got there.</p> <p>"Come on!" I said as I helped her out of the bed, taking her as I lay down beside her. I could feel her hips start to bounce slowly as I started massaging around her pussy with my cock.</p> <p>"Are you ready, honey? Let me feel you." I murmured.</p> <p>Without waiting for her consent, I slipped the two of us under the covers and slid into her, feeling her heat enveloping me. She wrapped her legs around me slightly.</p> <p>"Your going to feel so fucking good!" I told her.</p> <p>"We're almost there!" she said with a sigh.</p> <p>"Well, I'll just have to wait until you're ready!" I retorted.</p> <p>I pressed as hard as I could into her and felt her ass flatten slightly against me which seemed to excite her body.</p> <p>"Ah yes...yes, that's it for me....that's it.....yes....." She gasped as my body was held tight against hers.</p> <p>"Oh...okay...." I said as I began sliding in and out of her with short, quick thrusts, knowing that she liked it.</p> <p>She started to push back with her ass, her hips rising slightly off the bed.
