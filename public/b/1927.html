What about what you did in the pool?" She looked straight ahead from his cock and his face.</p> <p>"Oh."</p> <p>He looked at her, searching her eyes for what she was wondering. She smiled.</p> <p>"It was pretty nice huh?"</p> <p>She smiled at him and leaned forward so that her tits were pressing tight against his chest.</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>"I like, that you and I have been fucking like that." Her hand moved up and she wrapped it around Eric's cock.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"I liked you doing that," she purred with her hot mouth enveloping his cock. "Just like it was when you took me to the top of the hill."</p> <p>She released him and he lifted her off his cock.</p> <p>"Okay, I'm up for it. Let's do that."</p> <p>She pulled his shorts up and they tiptoed out of the pool and into the house. He didn't stop her so she was up all the way to her bedroom and she was there before he could even get his shorts off. He lay at the end of the bed as she removed her own and lay down, her legs spread to give him access. She opened her eyes, then smiled at Eric. He looked at her. "What now?"</p> <p>She sat up. "Let's just make ourselves comfortable. I like that way."</p> <p>He reached for a pillow and pulled the duvet off. They lay there, facing each other, his head on her tits and his cock rising.</p> <p>"Let's move down first." His fingers played with her nipples. "Go slow."</p> <p>He took her hands away from his cock. She smiled. He took a breast in hand and sucked her nipple into his mouth.</p> <p>His hand moved over her cunt, parting her lips and finding wetness. Her body moved with him. His hands touched the lips of her pussy. She put her hands on his chest, moaning slightly. He took his cock and pressed it against her clit. She was wet, her body moving against his, as he slid up and down. She raised her hips against him again.</p> <p>"Okay." She turned back and kissed him passionately. She held the head of his cock as it entered her.</p> <p>She lay back, looking at his face. She closed her eyes as he entered her slowly.</p> <p>"Does he know about you, uh?"</p> <p>"Well, I guess," she moaned. "It's sort of weird to be on his cock and that's how he feels. I guess he thinks I'm just a whore to him. He does like it hard and fast, and I like it slow and easy, and when the tension builds, it always makes him lose control, not wanting to stop. He does want to fuck me, don't you?"</p> <p>"Yes," he replied. "It makes me very horny too. And you're a lot like the rest of us, I have to admit."</p> <p>"Me too. I was always pretty passive when it comes to boys. They just do what they want, it's a game, no matter what they choose to do, just for me." She sighed. "I liked the way Eric was fucking me like that, I liked him taking control."</p> <p>Eric moved his hips up and down, sliding his cock deeper and deeper inside her. He liked the way she was breathing, her tits moving against him, her hips moving up and down... he just kept going. Each upstroke was exactly as he liked it to be.</p> <p>"Oh," she mumbled with moans. "Yes, Eric." Her hips moved with him, moving to meet him each time. "Oh, god, yes, fuck me Eric."</p> <p>Eric took over; he was going to be a jackhammer soon. He felt he needed to come before he did something that would hurt her, that might cause her the greatest pain. He kept his hips moving, driving his cock into her, driving her orgasm up to the point of no return. Finally, he could hold it no more. He slammed his cock full length into her, holding her hips firmly so that she couldn't move away and let his seed erupt into her insides. He felt his cock spurting, his hips thrusting with as much energy as he got.</p> <p>Afterward, they fell back onto the bed. They lay there, kissing, trying to come to grips with what they had just done. The fact that there did not seem to be anything between them and that they had been in love meant a lot to her. But it was something she had to come to terms with and something that was still new for her to accept. She could not believe sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
