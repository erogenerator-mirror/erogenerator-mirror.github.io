He asked with his head shaking back and forth.</p> <p>"Why," I asked taking his head in both hands. He pushed back onto me, and I pulled him into me with a kiss. We both knew this was going to be the start of an amazing relationship.</p> <p>He slowly worked his cock inside me, filling me with it every time, while it went deeper and deeper. It was the most amazing feeling I had ever felt. It was the most amazing sensation.</p> <p>"Oh," was all he could say as his cock sunk further and further into me.</p> <p>I felt his lips against mine again, and started to gently grind against it, trying to feel the same feeling of him as I felt it a few minutes earlier.</p> <p>"Oh," he started to whimper, and he was starting to moan like a little animal as he started to thrust himself against me hard and fast. It felt incredible. It felt amazing, and I started to moan myself. I felt the sweat running down my face, and I knew I would probably be making that noise pretty soon.</p> <p>"Ooouuh," I moaned as I felt myself cum for the first time, feeling his cock pulse inside of me, feeling his hot cum filling me up, then feeling him slowly pull out of me.</p> <p>I felt his dick slip out of me. I looked up with my knees weak, and we both collapsed to the bed. As he pulled himself to his feet, his dick sprung back to full mast. He leaned over and kissed me long and passionately, and I closed my eyes in ecstasy. He rolled over on his side, bringing his arm up around me. "That was incredible."</p> <p>I laughed a little at that, and I kissed him back, sharing his mouth with me. He kissed me deeply, his tongue sliding around mine all over. He rolled over again under me, and rolled himself up on his side. He slid his arm across my hip, and his body moved just slightly to side on mine, as he pulled me closer to him. I wrapped my arms around his neck and kissed him softly on the lips before we drifted out of the room.</p> <p>"You are going to let me get the rest of the way?" He asked quietly. I smiled at that, and looked up at the ceiling. We had been talking about getting a hotel room together, a long and meaningful relationship.</p> <p>"You want to go to a hotel room with me?" I asked.</p> <p>He smiled. "The closest one is a block away from the school and the whole campus."</p> <p>"Okay, where then?" I asked.</p> <p>"Anywhere, anywhere," he replied.</p> <p>I looked at him lovingly, and said "Let's go to the city."</p> <p>We had gone from one of the most memorable weekends of dating to actually making love. The first time we had both cum, in the same night. That is, if I couldn't get myself off in time.</p> <p>"I want you to make love to me," I said at last.</p> <p>"Well," he spoke softly, but confidently, with a touch of concern. "I'm not going to take anything from you."</p> <p>I didn't say anything. I just kissed him softly again, and nodded.</p> <p>"Okay, what's up with you," he asked with a smile.</p> <p>"I just want to feel you," I replied. "Just once."</p> <p>"You are amazing," he said before putting his hand on my face and kissing me once more.</p> <p>*</p> <p>The following week was the end of a busy three-day weekend, with many different events. It was a wonderful adventure, and I was looking forward to getting to know my new roommate better.</p> <p>We met for dinner that night, and after dinner I asked him if he would like to stay the night with me. While we had been talking, I had dropped the subject of him going back to California with his new girlfriend, and he agreed to try it.</p> <p>"I think I want to stay in bed with you," he said, leaning over and squeezing my hand. I smiled, taking his hand and placing it on my thigh. It sent a wave of desire through me, and I knew by his expression that it wouldn't take long before he would be wanting me.</p> <p>"I like the idea," I said with a laugh, kissing him. He kissed me back, and began to move his hand over my body. "But I'm sure going to have a difficult time with you when I'm gone." His hand moved over to my breast, finding my nipple already erect. He softly caressed me, making me get wet again.</p> <p>"Let's get you in bed and get some sleep," heâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
