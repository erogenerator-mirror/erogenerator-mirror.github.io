I shook my head.</p> <p>"We just talked, you know what I mean?" I just held on to you, and you seemed to smile back at me.</p> <p>"Yeah..." I told you.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"I said I'm okay, right?" I still did everything I could do to keep it from becoming a nightmare.</p> <p>"That's not what I meant."</p> <p>"What was it? I don't want to know." I tried to keep you in my corner.</p> <p>"Hey! Look, I'm not going into the kitchen."</p> <p>"I can help. Do you mind if I stay for just a little while?"</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Come on, just for a little bit." You took my hand and led me back into the kitchen. I sat down at the table, and you sat across from me, your arms still around me.</p> <p>"I'm sorry. I wish you all could understand. I hope you understand, because I love you." I just looked at you and shook my head.</p> <p>"I won't cry, and neither will you. I just can't. I can hardly take anymore of this right now."</p> <p>"You're right. I guess we should make my turn around." With that you turned on your heel and began to walk to the door to your office.</p> <p>"I guess you're right."</p> <p>"Why do you think I want to go. You don't get to go. I never got that. Why, I still get to go."</p> <p>"You don't understand."</p> <p>"Don't be a dumbass." We laughed as soon as you opened the door to your office. As you came back into the office door, you were holding a small bag with all your personal items under it.</p> <p>"I made a note in my schedule to meet after work tonight. I have a meeting with her husband tomorrow, but I might as well go to bed now." You laughed. "Now you just sit there. You should really get home and relax before you have to go to bed with your husband." I sat quietly for a minute, contemplating my last chance to get out of a situation with you. How should I respond to you? Well, I guess I can't really get mad about it. It doesn't feel right. I know it's not something we could even say, or do, just because you don't feel right with me.</p> <p>"That's fine with me. I'm feeling pretty bad about it."</p> <p>"Don't you dare make fun of me!"</p> <p>"You're right, but I am being silly," you said and sat down in the chair beside yours. I sat down against an armchair, as you took your bag and returned it to your side as you sat it on the table.</p> <p>"Okay," I said, unsure what to do. "You have a safe word?"</p> <p>"I've never used it. But I suppose you wouldn't mind letting me call you 'baby'."</p> <p>"I don't want to be the kind of girl who does it. Maybe it's just another phase or something."</p> <p>"That doesn't sound very romantic at all. Why don't we call it a night?"</p> <p>"I can't. I'm busy all night." You grabbed my hand and pulled me toward the bedroom. You turned me around as you walked me to your bed, and pulled me on top of you.</p> <p>"Baby, are you all right? Is this what you want?"</p> <p>"Baby, I'm just a little scared." I started kissing you and started pulling down your shirt. You pulled me upward and lifted my shirt up, kissing me until it was bunched, then you pulled me up again and kissed me.</p> <p>When I started to do that, you lifted me off your chest and lifted me over your head. You carried me into the bathroom across the room, with me lying down on the toilet. I turned my head to the side and looked into the mirror. I took a deep breath and tried to calm down.</p> <p>"You're nervous," you told me. "Are you okay with this? You can stop if you want. You have a choice."</p> <p>"You can do whatever you want, or just go back to being like this with me!"</p> <p>"Okay. You're not going to be unhappy. I mean, I know you're busy right now, but you'll have time to go to bed and have a good time with me tonight."</p> <p></p> <p>We fell asleep a few Hours later. I woke with my head on your chest, feeling my arms and chest.
