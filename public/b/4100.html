I felt the hot skin on my cheek slide down and between my lips. I closed my eyes and breathed deeply, trying to not remember how my husband used to do all those things with me. My fingers drifted up to brush the silky hair away from my face, and I thought the feel of his hands on my fingers was something I would die for in my dreams. But before I could even think of a way to do him this favor, he stopped me, pushing me away.</p> <p>"I can't do this." He shook his head. "Please?"</p> <p>I felt my heart skip and stopped breathing. "Okay" I said, and gave in to his obvious charm once more. I opened my eyes and looked up at him, trying to find something to say.</p> <p>He took two steps forward, towering over me. "Are you sure you want to?"</p> <p>I looked back and smiled, blushing. "I'm not sure."</p> <p>He laughed and ran his hands up my neck. I could feel his lips coming towards mine, but instead of kissing it I ran my tongue in them before he even pressed his body against me. I felt his hand in the middle of my back, running over the skin for a moment before pushing back and leading me forwards towards the back of the couch. When he reached under my blouse to undo my bra, I was shocked to feel he was in bed, and there was no doubt. He undid my bra, freeing my breasts. He held my small breasts in his hands, gently rolling my hardening nipples between his thumbs and fingers. I shivered as it was electrifying.</p> <p>"It's okay," I whispered.</p> <p>I felt his lips on my collar bone, licking and nipping.</p> <p>"Oh, sorry," he said softly, looking up at me.</p> <p>"It's the least I can do," I said softly. I felt my heart sink slightly when those lips left me and looked down again at me. I didn't know where I was being lead anymore, but I had definitely given in once.</p> <p>He placed his hands at the waist of my pants, and slid them down to my thighs. His hand slid up the inside of my thigh, and made contact with my pussy. I was so wet it was almost painful. He slid his middle finger through my lips, rubbing lightly before dipping in. His finger brushed against my clit, and I shuddered. He kept up what he was doing, and eventually I felt the warmth of the fire I had been building. He smiled when he heard me groan.</p> <p>"Do not move," he said softly. "I won't hurt you. It's okay."</p> <p>I nodded and rested my head on his shoulder. I didn't think there was anymore. He gently moved his fingers out of my pants, replacing them with his mouth. His tongue slid into the little opening, licking at it. He started to press himself firmly against my pussy, rubbing my clit with his nose. I leaned back on the couch, my hands running over his body and feeling his muscles. I pulled on his shirt, loosening the tie and reaching behind my neck to undo the buttons on his shirt. He pulled back again, then quickly unbuttoned the knot of his boxers, letting them fall to the ground.</p> <p>He reached down to the side of his pants, and I knew he wanted me to put them back on. He sat up and pulled my hair to get control of it. I felt my clit throbbing as he did with his fingers as he moved my hair. He leaned in again, then kissed his way up my neck. His lips grazed mine, then his lips reached around to the back of my ear where I could feel his tongue tracing over the lobe. I leaned my head back when his tongue made contact with my skin. I ran my hand on his back, moving up along his spine as his lips traveled down, following the line between my shoulder to the line of my neck, kissing and licking as his hands caressed my body. His lips brushed against my collarbone, and I shuddered. His hand cupped my breast as his tongue did the same to the other. His tongue slid lower, tracing across my nipple as his lips covered the one.</p> <p>Oh god, I wanted him. I wanted him to make love to me. I wanted him to make love to me so hard, so forceful, so raw. I wanted him to fuck me until I couldn't move, I wanted him to make me cum over and over. He pulled away and looked at me. I smiled.</p> <p>"I want to eat your pussy right now," he said softly.</p> <p>"I want to be eaten so badly right now I can hardly breatheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
