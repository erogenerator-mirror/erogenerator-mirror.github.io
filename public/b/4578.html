We sat down in the bar, and had already downed more drinks. I noticed that the girls were talking to many of the guys, and were also dancing together. They were really getting into the music, and were whispering to each others in their ear. There were a few other couples dancing in the crowd, and they were looking right at us.</p> <p>I felt my cock starting to stiffen as I looked over and saw that two of the girls were swaying their hips in time with their dance. One of the girls was also a little tipsy as it was pouring out of her body, and she had a hand over her tit. It gave me a good view of her cleavage, and she was rubbing back while she did.</p> <p>A couple of girls got up and sat down near me, and I could feel their arms moving around each other, as if they were dancing together. One of the girls was rubbing my crotch, and one of the girls was rubbing my thigh. I could feel myself getting as stiff as a board as she got closer to me.</p> <p>She looked over at me, and licked her lips, which were very close to my crotch, and then she looked back down at my crotch and licked her lips again. She leaned forward against my arm, and whispered in my ear, "I've made my friends jealous tonight, and I'm going to have to get them all jealous tonight." She pulled back and looked me in the eyes, and then lowered her body between my legs so that her skirt hiked up and her panties became visible to the other girls in the crowd. The skirt slid up so that her mound was now almost exposed.</p> <p>She whispered again in my ear, "Is this something you can help me with?"</p> <p>"Yes," I breathed in her ear, "it is."</p> <p>She leaned forward and kissed me gently on the lips with a sexy, tongue-tasting kiss. I was just about to kiss her again when she pushed back, looked up at the two of us, and then slid off the bar stool, leaving my hard cock sticking out of my pants. She got up on the bar stool and I started to sit down. She put her hands on my shoulders and pushed me back against the stool, leaned down, and we began to French kiss again, this time a lot more sensually.</p> <p>The girls were talking about us while we were making out, and I was not looking at the bar at all. If I did think I was in a better position.</p> <p>The rest of the evening was a blur except for one brief "private" encounter that was quickly followed by a "business trip" that involved a lot of groping and kissing.</p> <p>We got home and had some good sleep in the next day and the next. A very enjoyable sex session, and very erotic sex involving both of our dates - we had a wonderful fuckâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
