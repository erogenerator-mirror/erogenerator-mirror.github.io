I'll be in my room by the time you're done," she replied, her eyes flashing for a moment.</p> <p>"Sure you can come by when you can spare the time and I'll be waiting." She got up and went about to head down the hall to her room.</p> <p>When I finished getting dressed in the kitchen, I went down to meet her. She was sitting at the dining room table, reading her book. I was sitting on the other side of her in a very smart pair of jeans. He white vests were stretched tightly around her and the way they hugged her slim waist, almost to the point of almost exposing her midriff, and the contrast of their blue jeans was quite erotic. Her dress was a sheer lace with lace and had a slit cut in front that led to a bare slit through which a pair of white lace panties could be seen.</p> <p>"Do you like my new dress?" she said, sitting up.</p> <p>"I think it's beautiful, and I hope you liked seeing it," I replied.</p> <p>"You'd make me very, very happy to wear that," she said.</p> <p>"Me too ... for now. It's been a long week and it doesn't take me long to feel that way about you." Her eyes looked at me then back to the book she was reading. "Are you going for lunch this afternoon?" my voice was a bit breathless.</p> <p>"Sure. I'll see you later, then," she answered, her eyes still on the book.</p> <p>"That will be great. You just have to be careful about the way you dress this afternoon." She turned and left.</p> <p>I had to have seen this coming, now.</p> <p>"Hi, you look really good today," I stammered.</p> <p>"I'm looking good too, with my dress on I feel like being a hot little bitch in the fashion magazines," she smiled at me. I was glad to hear that, but also somewhat nervous.</p> <p>"You don't look as bad as you did in the restaurant yesterday," I said.</p> <p>"I look good for someone looking like you. Not that I look bad, they just don't know the difference," she said, raising her cup of tea to her nose and swallowing with a swallow. With a bit of a belly laugh.</p> <p>"I'm glad you're not doing too much of a thing to change your appearance. Your parents have sent me the money and your Auntie said you're too young to date yet," I said, trying to steer the subject away from her being so hot and sexy.</p> <p>"Not until you get some really nice clothes to make me your hot pet," she said, her voice tinged even higher. And with that, she turned and went downstairs to eat.</p> <p>I started dinner, and my eyes continued down her body as she sat at the table eating. It was a little too tempting to pass up such a lovely display. Her breasts seemed to defy gravity and her nipples seemed to be begging for attention. The way she held herself seemed inviting and inviting. I began to wonder if her nipples would ever go away.</p> <p>As dinner ended, and the meal started, it didn't take long to notice that she was even more flushed than in the restaurant, as she was just a bit flushed all over and looking flushed. She gave me a quick hug and kiss when we got into the hallway and walked into her room as to not cause any more embarrassment. As we crossed the threshold I looked back again to the book she had been reading. "That will do, you seem to have gotten me a bit warm," I mused, wondering how long this little display had made me. She was definitely flushed and looking very much hotter the longer we were gone. She stopped as she entered her room and turned to me.</p> <p>"Are you feeling warm? I need to run a warm bath."</p> <p>"Well, I'd hate to keep you so hot," I said, trying to joke by flirting with her.</p> <p>She gave me a grin and then turned to go to get the tub.</p> <p>When she came back with the tub I told her not to bother with that shower. "I'll go and fetch our clothes," I said.</p> <p>"Are they in the hamper? You didn't put them there."</p> <p>"I brought them with me from the house," I replied. Then I grabbed a spare robe from a nearby closet and went into the bathroom. As I was doing so, she had come out of the bedroom door. I stepped into the bath and took the bath sponge and the towel off of the hook and wrapped my towel around my waist. I began to wash her back and as I did Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
