You don't have to answer anytime but when you ask, you can say it."</p> <p>"Oh, okay, I guess I should have said anything. But I don't mind...I don't, not at all." She leaned back against the arm of the sofa, resting a hand on her cheek and taking a sniff at the smell of her own arousal. I leaned towards her and kissed her lips firmly, and she melted into me and kissed me back tenderly. We kissed and she rubbed her lips against mine, breathing heavily and moaning softly.</p> <p>Without breaking off our embrace, I reached down and found her breasts through the thin material of her t-shirt. I started to fondle them through her shirt and she moaned softly and pulled us back together, pressing her body against mine. Then I unbuttoned her top, and reached into her top to get at one of her breasts, which I cupped, and began to rub her nipple. She moaned and ran her fingers down my body, touching my hard cock through my pants, which elicited a low groan from my lips. I released her breast and pushed her back on the sofa, kneeling astride her and kissing her, tasting her juices. I pulled my hands away and slid them under her shorts to her naked thighs, feeling the smooth skin of her legs against my fingers. Her nipples were already hard and erect and pressed against my palms, begging for attention, so I took them between my thumbs and fingers and softly massaged them, making the flesh move around slightly with every caress as I traced her body. I kissed my way down to her belly button, and felt it quiver with every kiss. I could still feel her lips on my cock...her warm breath in my pubes. I continued to kiss and lick her thighs, enjoying the feel of her soft skin and hair, and her juices on my lips and tongue. I could tell the urgency in her breathing. I kept going until I felt her hand on the top of my head, softly rubbing my cheek. I pulled back up, taking her hands and letting hers go and she guided me towards her body, sliding me in easily and gasping. I went straight for her center and felt her start at my cock, pushing back towards me and sliding along the length of my member. I kissed her softly, and she kissed me back, as she pushed the lips of her cunt onto my prick and I slipped in, the tip of my prick parting her lips and touching the inside of her warm passage. She moaned happily, her fingers on my cheek, and slowly guided me in.</p> <p>"Oh god," she whispered. "This is so nice...it's the longest and thickest...how much more?"</p> <p>"Just a bit," I said, "we'll go slowly."</p> <p>"Just a bit? Oh. There's still a bit more?" She said, her eyes closing with her mouth open.</p> <p>I pulled myself out of her body, making her mouth hang open in shock at the sudden withdrawal, then felt her wetness.</p> <p>"No, that just happens when you love what you feel," I said, reaching past her body to find something on her legs, and she saw me holding a long object with the end glistening wet.</p> <p>She looked at it thoughtfully for a moment. "I see how much enjoyment it makes." She said. "I think I was born to feel it, so here, put this inside me and take me to heaven."</p> <p>I put the head of my cock at the very top of her hole and began to push forward, feeling the warmness of her pussy stretch around my swollen cockhead. I pulled back slowly, feeling her body tremble as I did so, and looked at her. "Do you want me inside you now?" I asked.</p> <p>"Oh...yes...I'm so ready for it...but first, will you go slowly for me. I need to get used to this again. I really need to feel it again."</p> <p>"Of course," I said, feeling the blood in my heart race. I couldn't believe it was going to be this easily.</p> <p>With my free hand I took hold of the end of it, letting slip my glistening finger between her swollen pussy lips, feeling the silky wetness coating it. I pulled back slightly, and she gasped and reached down to pull me down. A loud moan came out of her lips, and I could see her chest rising and falling gently as she let go of my cock. In my new position I could see her body quiver and knew she was close to orgasm, but only a few, not quite enough to bring her to it. But I wanted her to. I had to feel that beautiful cunt again, to hear itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
