Not just that, but his friend.</p> <p>I couldn't believe I was actually going to call him. I had to see that face again and again. I even called him a few times during the week and he responded, all with a smile on his face that told me he appreciated whatever I was doing. But when we got to his friend's house this time, I was so turned on, I could barely contain my lust. When I had to see him at the party the previous weekend, I was thinking of his friend and how much I liked him.</p> <p>At first, I was going to go over to meet him and then he would be gone. After we walked in though, I just wanted to know how and where we had met up and what it was like. What he looked like. What he wanted. How we had laughed about it. How we had made a pact.</p> <p>A pact? No. That would mean our souls had bonded together somehow and when I saw him, I was so excited, my whole body was trembling.</p> <p>I was thinking and acting at the same time and his friend was being a gentleman. That he was going to let me touch him too. He would let me take care of his girl. That I could feel everything. How he would feel. How I would feel. When I was alone, I had so much to do.</p> <p>As I said, I couldn't wait to see that face. I wanted to call it, for sure, but knew I didn't have the nerve; I just didn't want my body saying what it wanted.</p> <p>One of his friends had asked if I would give Tony a kiss. I hadn't agreed. He hadn't really meant that, he just assumed I would give in. So, the next day, I didn't say yes so I wouldn't say yes after all. It was a mistake. I didn't let him do it and he had never actually called me. It was just his friend's kiss that caused a moment. This was too important and this was too serious to mess up.</p> <p>Later he told me that his friend had put on a real show for me last night and that I had given him a kiss. He said he wouldn't be mad at me that time, after his friend had kissed me. So, I had no intention of letting him kiss my pussy again because I didn't want to ruin what they had.</p> <p>But tonight, I needed to see how big his smile was. Not only would I love to take care of it later tonight, but I wanted to see his expression as he gave me the biggest hug I had ever received. Not only was his body a beautiful man, but he was also funny and had a gorgeous smile. This could be the man I had fallen in love with the last six years.</p> <p>I couldn't wait to see those eyes again and as soon as the doorbell went, I ran to put on the dress and got it. Then I ran over to the door and got it open and saw that Tony had opened it for me and invited me in. He had a smile on his face and it was like I had stepped out of another world.</p> <p>He had put on his best smile and I could see the world was spinning around him with the two of us.</p> <p>Finally, he was dressed and I asked him if he wanted to join us. We went back to his room and I stripped, too. We all went into his king sized bed and immediately rolled around on it as we had done before. But now, we all had our heads hung down in the air, so we didn't do much.</p> <p>"What should we do now?" I asked them all.</p> <p>"Oh, I don't know" he said. "Let's go to my place."</p> <p>"Oh you're sure?" I said, still not believing I was actually in his bedroom.</p> <p>"What do you mean exactly?" he asked.</p> <p>"If you don't like him, I can always go back to my room." I told him. "If he doesn't like me, it would be alright with you." I added and he rolled me back to him and I kissed him on the lips.</p> <p>"That's fine," he said. "I've wanted you to kiss me for so long, it doesn't get any better than this."</p> <p>He reached under my skirt and rubbed my ass through my panties. He knew I loved wearing panties because I just knew that he could smell my arousal. He lifted my skirt and slid his hand up my thigh to my pussy. There wasn't any hair except for my landing strip and my outer lips were already moist. He stroked my lips while his other fingers were exploring my entrance and I moved my hands over his body to feel hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
