She went up on her toes, and they did that a few more time before we fell onto our backs and rolled onto our sides. She laid under me, and I rolled onto mine, and we held each other, looking into the eyes of the sun as we drifted lazily off into a peaceful slumber.</p> <p>In this state we had slept on our sides, looking up at the sky as our chests rose and fell as we inhaled and exhaled. I caressed her chest through her shirt, and felt a slight twinge of excitement as we realized that she wasn't going to be sleeping with our eyes open.</p> <p>I felt a twitch of excitement as it confirmed my suspicion that it was just a dream. I wasn't sure what exactly I imagined about a dream, but we had this one, and that was definitely the most exciting one yet.</p> <p>"I'm going to get up," I said, "If we are going to get up, we need to be ready at this point, or we're going to go crazy." I had to take a deep breath to control the laughter that would start to escape, or she would wake up, and we would spend the whole day like that!</p> <p>She smiled broadly, and I felt a sense of relief as I rolled off her, and headed for the bathroom. Her eyes popped open immediately as I walked into the bathroom, and she looked surprised to see me. "Where are you going, stud?" she asked, giggling.</p> <p>I walked up behind her and wrapped my arms around her. I kissed her softly on the neck and she sighed with a soft moan. "You better clean up," I whispered in her ear as I grabbed the hand lotion from my clothes pocket, and wiped the lotion on her back.</p> <p>I put on my shirt and boxers, and stood there waiting for her. She reached up to grab my shorts, but then turned her head and said, "There's no need to do that. I can get a better scrub." She reached around me and pulled me closer, then grabbed my hand and squeezed it. "Take your clothes off and help me get in, and we'll get some sleep before we're late."</p> <p>As she climbed into bed with me that night, I felt as if there was no doubt in my mind that what had already happened had been planned for quite a while, and could very easily have lasted much longer. Sure, we had been doing this for a long time, but she had said that her experience with a man had been with him, but her real experience had been something she never could remember. It's never been about sex in her mind, she had said, and it had never occurred to her in the past.</p> <p>We had always talked a lot about having two partners at once, but never did it before, and the real thing wasn't that far apart from that. She had been with her first "husband", and this second one had been a long time, and they had been good friends, but that wasn't what had really happened. I think she was in love with her first one, because I had been a total jerk when she had introduced me to Mark. The last guy that she had been with was my own uncle, and he had a different perspective than our parents. They were different! Anyway, that thought alone made me think that maybe she was in love with her first lover.</p> <p>She was still in bed, and I was looking over her body in the light of the full moon streaming through the windows, but she could see me looking over. She smiled again, and I was starting to blush a little. I was afraid that she wanted to feel more of me just then, but then I felt a little better a little, and I let my hands linger over her soft breasts for a couple of seconds. I could feel the fabric of her panties against my erection, and this made me shudder slightly.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful, honey," I whispered in her ear, "I'm just happy that you like that."</p> <p>"Honey, are you really happy?" she teased, "No, not really. I guess I'm just happy that you enjoy me, that you like me, and that that's all that counts."</p> <p>"And what about you, my dear?" I asked as my hands traced down her sides again. I felt myself blushing again, but I really liked her for her honesty in our conversation. "This is so crazy. I don't think I could have imagined that my first love would really be this wonderful."</p> <p>"Mmm, I like that you like me too. You mean that much to me?" She smiled playfully and kissed me lightly on the cheek. "I told you before that I'm not into sex, and it's not your fault that I know what my life is likeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
