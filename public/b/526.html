It wasn't what he wanted to do to her.</p> <p>"Just don't take me home like this; okay? I'll be fine. That's all." Her eyes were pleading with him now.</p> <p>"No ...," He started to say. "I love you, I think I would die for you. And if you don't want me to be you anyway, my love..." He trailed off in confusion.</p> <p>"I want you to be with me," she said, almost too loudly. "We can be together forever. Please go easy. I'm not going to make this happen."</p> <p>"That's not the issue," he said and stepped away from her. The way she held herself was more than enough to convince him. He turned back to his table with a frown. He looked at the woman beside his son.</p> <p>"He's his mom," Sam said. Sam had a glint in her eye and saw that she wanted to run.</p> <p>"Well, maybe I'm the one that has a problem," Jack said. "And I'm your mother to think that's not going to work," She said, shaking her head. He was so confused.</p> <p>"I want to see you,"</p> <p>"I want to see my brother," He said at the same time she did. He couldn't even look at her. Sam's hand shot to her lips.</p> <p>"See you too, Jack." He smiled at her and stepped quickly to the door and shut it when he saw the way the light went out.</p> <p>He turned and looked at her, seeing a look of determination in her eyes. He knew then that he would just have to find something to do about this. They couldn't talk. He walked up to her, leaning forward over her to kiss her lips lightly. He heard her breath catch and felt her hand reach out to grab his face and pull it to hers, pushing their mouths together. They moaned softly and he reached around her to start playing with her breasts, squeezing them and pinching her nipples gently.</p> <p>He broke the kiss and sat down next to her on the cold seat. They sat there for a long time, both looking at each other, neither knowing what to do. Finally, Jack reached over and pulled her to him. He kissed her and pulled her to her feet. He wanted to show her the way, that she didn't need to be afraid. He wanted her to want him, to feel what was going on in his world. They stood there naked for only a few moments then Jack led her over to the couch.</p> <p>Jack sat her down and he gently pulled down his boxers and slid himself down between her legs. His penis sprang from its prison as she took in the sight of him. She looked him in the eyes and kissed him quickly.</p> <p>"Mmmm," she said, "Mmmm. You're so big..." She laughed.</p> <p>He smiled back at her as he slid himself in her. The sensation of his shaft filling her was the perfect combination of warmth and tightness. He thrust in and out, slowly at first, feeling her take him in, and then harder. He looked down into those blue blue eyes and saw the determination that he had known long ago.</p> <p>"Sam..." he groaned. "I want you too..."</p> <p>"Yes," she said with a smile.</p> <p>She smiled back at him, kissing him as he continued to thrust against her.</p> <p>"Please," She said softly. He smiled again and reached up to her breasts to play with them, squeezing and twisting her nipples gently and then pulling them with his thumbs.</p> <p>"You're lovely," Jack said softly.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>She looked down at him and giggled as she moved his hands to her crotch, pulling him to her, and opening herself to him. He slid himself into her to the base with one stroke, and she pulled him in again. He was so long. She could feel him sliding into her as the tip of his penis rubbed her g-spot. She was panting and thrusting against him as she came.</p> <p>"Let me," she gasped.</p> <p>Jack rolled on top of her, his penis still in her, and she slid down so that his weight was on her upper thigh and his body over hers. They both stared into each other's eyes as they started to move. Her legs wrapped around him and her arms around his neck, holding tightly onto him as they began to move.</p> <p>"Uh huh," he thought as he thrust harder into her.</p> <p>"This is what you wanted," she said with a smile, looking into his eyes.</p> <p>"Yes," he said with a gasp as he thrust into her harder and harder. He felt himself come and heardâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
