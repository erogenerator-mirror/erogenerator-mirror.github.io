"Maybe this will go away." He says with a smile.</p> <p>I shake my head and stare at the ceiling, "No, no, it won't. But that's not why I brought it up now. I was hoping that you would stop being so upset."</p> <p>"Then maybe we should wait until our baby gets out? I'm just so happy when I see her." he says in a soft voice that I couldn't even hear anymore.</p> <p>"Yes, that's really true." I say and he agrees. That's all I need is some type of intervention. The baby's a girl with long blonde hair. She's still just a baby. I put a blanket on the blanket and we sit next to each other in the warm night and just talk.</p> <p>"So, the baby is now yours?" I asked again.</p> <p>"Yes. It's going to be a girl. It's just that I'm so happy. I couldn't be happier." he says. I nod my head and agree with him.</p> <p>"You two need to do it right?" I ask.</p> <p>"It feels good, I love you so much." he says back.</p> <p>"I love you too. That's it. Now, I've got to go in and say a big 'Thank you'." I said. They both smile and I go inside.</p> <p>I love my husband. It never stops. Never stops. He knows how important I am to him. I'll never leave him. If I get pregnant, then so is he too. We'll have such a baby.</p> <p>Chapter 5: A Mother's Love</p> <p>As I'm lying there in my bed and thinking and thinking about him I'm actually sad. I want to go to the doctor and have an abortion. As I laid there with my thoughts of him on my mind. I can't. I know it takes a lot for me to just go to a doctor I was married to. Even as upset as I am in that moment. That's my fault...</p> <p>I know it won't change our marriage. I'm just so jealous that he still loves me. When we first got married. I saw a beautiful man with beautiful gray hair and a wonderful personality. I saw a guy about my age with beautiful green eyes staring at me. As my mind goes back over my life. I know it's wrong. I can't. I can't even go back to that. All I can do now is lay there and think and worry.</p> <p>I can't. I'll sleep alone in my bed tonight and wake up this morning still horny. I have to go to the doctor and have my abortion and make him promise that he will stop fucking me. He's already in Europe today. There is absolutely nothing for me to do other to make him promise that he will stop fucking me.</p> <p>I'm just so happy, I can't even think of anything else. It makes me feel guilty about how I've been behaving and I feel a little like I'm betraying him with this sexless sexless love of mine. That feeling makes me feel guilty. As if I'm doing something wrong. I am betraying my husband. I'm betraying myself. The feelings that I've got are making me feel guilty. It's all so wrong.</p> <p>I just wish that I had a real life with a husband and a real wife. I wish that I could meet the love that just fell into my lap because I didn't know why. I wish it was true. I wish that something would happen between me and my loving husband. I just wish I had a real life of happiness with a good man.</p> <p>The sexless sexless sexless sexless sexless life is just sex just sex and the only real person in it right now is my husband. I have to make him stop having sex with me. He'll probably stop fucking me if he finds out I'm cheating on him. I have to break it off.</p> <p>So instead of lying there and waiting for my husband to get home and I can't even fuck him again I just go to the doctor. He just won't leave me. He'll be so upset for telling me that he'll kill us both if he doesn't break it off. I'm scared. I'm so afraid of how he will react if he knows that I just cheated on him again.</p> <p>When I got the doctor and called his office, it sounded like he had everything under control. I had called him at least two times that day. His secretary kept sending me messages all day and he didn't even think about me at all. I got him to come home on Monday and I finally called him just to make sure that he would still stay over. Even though I'm pretty sure that he knows that it's not what he wantsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
