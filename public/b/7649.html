I was terrified I'd go over it, or at least think I wouldn't be able to do it.</p> <p>Trying to find a more sympathetic moment, I could feel her warm body pressed against mine and knew I was not alone. Her body was moving slightly, rubbing mine. "I feel...strange," I stammered.</p> <p>"Are you afraid?" She whispered.</p> <p>"Yes," I answered. I knew my face must have been bright red.</p> <p>"I've been trying, but they're really sensitive down there. I'm a pro." As she said this, her finger stroked my neck, rubbing just barely there. Her fingers felt good between my tits. I shivered from her closeness.</p> <p>As she had with the bar on her first visit, she got naked and started to caress me everywhere. I wasn't able to make any sound in spite of her constant kissing. Her body felt good and the friction of her stroking sent a shiver running through my entire body.</p> <p>I got hard and moved a hand between us. I was rubbing my clit against his belly. It was already a little moist and I loved it. "I want to hold you next to me," I heard her murmur. "I like that idea when we come."</p> <p>"It's okay!" I replied.</p> <p>She seemed to hesitate. She looked at me, uncertain. Then she reached down to guide my prick into herself. She lifted herself up. It felt warm and wet as I was inside her. She rocked forward until she was sitting with my legs in between hers as she rested her thighs against mine. She slowly sat, as though I could do more or less in and out of her. I could feel my hips starting to react. She didn't even notice.</p> <p>"It feels good," I murmured. My voice seemed shaky. I was sure she was too.</p> <p>She moved more carefully. I could feel the muscles in her legs trembling as she sat. After a while, she pushed me harder by sitting. I could feel my climax rising. I tried to sit up but her legs wouldn't move as they tried to pull me down onto her as I sat.</p> <p>"I should come," I protested, "I should be able to. I've never cum that hard in your..."</p> <p>"I want to," she breathed. As she spoke, her hips rotated rhythmically on hers. I could feel her muscles squeezing my prick. "I want to move as I come. I want to feel this."</p> <p>"Mmm!" I groaned, my breathing labored.</p> <p>"Is this something you do?"</p> <p>"Do it!" I cried out. Her pussy was squeezing and squeezing tighter around me.</p> <p>"This," she grunted, "is what you do when you're about to come. I like the way it works..."</p> <p>Her hips began jerking up and down faster. "I want you to come inside me...to give me everything you've got."</p> <p>"I can't," I whimpered. Despite my exhaustion, I could feel my breath getting short. I knew I was going to come again. Just the thought of it added to my excitement. "You're making me come..."</p> <p>"I said I was going to come inside you," she growled, pushing my thighs higher. "And I got me some nice pussy juice, too." She looked down into my eyes and she kissed me. "Let it happen. Let it come."</p> <p>Her body shuddered against mine and I let it. I could feel her muscles squeezing my cock, trying to milk it. The combination of her wetness and her orgasm was so incredibly sexy that I almost couldn't imagine doing anything else. My whole body suddenly went rigid. The sensation almost hurt. I held her tighter as my spasms subsided.</p> <p>When I could regain my breath, I looked up at her again and she kissed me. Her lips were still closed as she opened one eye and stared up at me with a dreamy expression. She seemed to think for a while before she spoke. "Do I make you hard again?" She sounded doubtful. She was not sure how I felt about it, but she seemed willing to give it a try. "Maybe," she answered. "Do you think I'll be able to?"</p> <p>Her eyes opened and she looked at me, suddenly shy again. She leaned up and kissed me again. She looked serious. "If you want to be able to, I'm yours to do whatever you want."</p> <p>I wasn't sure what I had heard, but I knew it was true. I reached up and took her face and lifted it from my breasts. Looking at her for a few moments, I spoke. "I'm ready, if you are," I saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
