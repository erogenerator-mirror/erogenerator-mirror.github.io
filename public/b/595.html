She continued, "I think we'll do some practicing."</p> <p>"I can't speak for how long after we leave for the airport I can't find my suitcase. I haven't been to England in so long and I'm so nervous. I'm supposed to be coming home in a few days; I should have thought to bring a small carry-on bag."</p> <p>He turned around and saw she had a smile in her eyes.</p> <p>"You'll like it here." she said, "My dad left us some money for you when you got here and the plane was ready to take off. It's not a place I ever imagined I'd be able to spend the next two days."</p> <p>He sat down and started to tell her the story of the first two days and a lot more, but he interrupted at the last part.</p> <p>"And you can guess where I picked this out."</p> <p>"You were right."</p> <p>He picked it out very carefully and had her help him to put it on.</p> <p>"I know how important this is to you; I've been meaning to ask to see it at least twice a year."</p> <p>"Why don't you find it and put it where you find it?"</p> <p>He could see her thinking, as if she already knew where this was going.</p> <p>"I'll be right back."</p> <p>Marge sat back down and watched as he took it all of it down. It turned to a yellow background and then all the way up. She was amazed that she was holding it, and that the two of them were getting each others clothes for the first time in over a year. She realized what she had been thinking. There were no underwear, she thought. Now she had no idea why this was happening. And she could hardly be embarrassed by it.</p> <p>She sat there, watching his little girl's reaction; the big grin on his face, the happy way he looked at her.</p> <p>"It was nice; I just never had the chance to enjoy being with a woman."</p> <p>"I never thought it would be so...so..." It was almost like the second most important thing he'd ever said to her. He was starting to get very shy and she realized that he might have told her he was nervous.</p> <p>"You want to see it too?" she asked, looking at him.</p> <p>He nodded enthusiastically. "Come see mine."</p> <p>His face had the look of an eager boy and the expression he had always found so funny. He didn't even bother with the underwear. He just looked at it while he made a little production of it. He was really getting excited. Maybe not as excited as he wanted to admit, he just sort of wanted it to happen.</p> <p>When he took his first step out of the shower she almost stopped him right there.</p> <p>"Are you sure you don't want to see my lingerie under that tank?"</p> <p>"You're doing fine."</p> <p>"Oh my god!"</p> <p>She could not believe that was coming from him. He had just turned the shower on and now was holding a bag under his arms with a bag under his head, and he just looked at her with his mouth hanging open. He was holding her like a scared little boy. Was this how it had been for her before she had married?</p> <p>"Come on, let's get into the bedroom."</p> <p>Her first impulse at this point was to pull away like it was her first time. She didn't.</p> <p>So she stood up and walked with him to the door. He had followed right on cue with his own foot. She was a little scared but she knew that she was supposed to follow his lead. They were on the way back to the room when she stopped her steps. He didn't waste any time and opened her arms. She was looking down at him smiling.</p> <p>"My god, you still have those tiny things on." She said after hugging him, trying to get as much of him inside her as she could.</p> <p>Their lips barely touched when the knock came but she opened her mouth and it met. His body stiffened in his excitement.</p> <p>"Come on in a sec." She said with a little giggle in her voice, "This has been so long since we've...I've missed you so much."</p> <p>He stood up and opened the door.</p> <p>"Just the same, you were there first. Now you want to try something new with me," he said as with his own head dropped to his shoulders. "I want to see what you got me..."</p> <p>When he walked in he was the epitome of what his wife had been waiting for.
