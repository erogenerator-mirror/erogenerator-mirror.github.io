He could hear her whimpering as her body writhed against him, trying to find it in her. He moved behind her, slowly pulling his cock from her hot body and pressing his cock against her wet asshole.</p> <p>The pain of her body taking over from his cock sent him over the edge. His balls tightened as his cock throbbed inside her ass. He groaned, holding his breath as he came inside the tight feeling ass.</p> <p>He could see his shaft pulse as it pumped sperm into her ass. His fingers found her clit as she writhed in orgasm underneath him. He could feel his fluids drip from her ass as orgasm ripped through her. She moaned with each orgasm and she continued to writhe under him for a moment until her body came down from the high. He slipped his fingers from her pussy and brought them to his mouth, taking another taste.</p> <p>"So good!" he said as he leaned over her and kissed her, still hard and strong from their encounter.</p> <p>Tina continued to writhe on her feet as they moved around the living room and into the kitchen. They made small talk as though nothing was happening, still drunk on pleasure. Tina felt him lean against her as they moved towards the refrigerator.</p> <p>"Are you gonna have any more hot chocolate?" she asked as they returned to the bathroom.</p> <p>"Sure, you hungry?" he responded.</p> <p>"No. Let me get that." She said as she leaned and picked her clothes up on the sink. "I'll get some extra dirty chocolate for you."</p> <p>"Are you sure. We don't want the neighbors catching a smell of it!" she joked as she got close to him.</p> <p>"If everyone is awake, it's probably okay with you," he answered as he stepped behind her.</p> <p>For once she made him feel good about their moment. Her body was soft against his. Their bodies had never been this close together before. They moved together and she was his again. He moved his hands down to her waist and caressed her as he stood behind her.</p> <p>"How does that feel, baby?" he teased her as she returned his kiss.</p> <p>"It's so damn good!" she cried as he reached behind and pulled her to him again as he kissed her neck. Her head began to fall back against his shoulder and he moved one hand up to play with her breast; one hand sliding up her stomach to play with her clit.</p> <p>The combination of her pussy juice and the attention he was giving her got her off again as she responded. She was so wet he could feel the cum leaking out of her ass. His hands worked his magic on her pussy and her moans grew louder. Her hands were moving over her body, pinching her nipple and stroking her clit at the same.</p> <p>"Oh, God! I need you inside me!" she cried out as she rolled over and reached down, pushing him against the wall, kissing him hard and passionately as she moved her hips up against him. The urgency in her body was building to the point of no return and she knew it was going to happen soon.</p> <p>"I need you to fuck me!" she cried out as one of her hands found the back of his neck and pulled him towards her. The words coming out of her mouth broke him from his fog. Tina was going to give her husband what he wanted now. She needed him in her right now. He needed her.</p> <p>His hands ran down her body, stopping at her ass cheeks to cup and squeeze as he moved their bodies against each other. He felt her hand slide back down to rub his cock as he continued to rub her clit as they moved. He could feel his cock growing even larger and he knew he was close to exploding inside of her. "So close!" he cried out as they kissed passionately once again.</p> <p>Tina could feel his cock pressing against her as she pulled away from him and turned around, presenting her ass to him once again. He moved one hand from her neck, along her hip and down her stomach as his lips and tongue found their way back to her dripping pussy and clit. He was about to have her, his daughterâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
