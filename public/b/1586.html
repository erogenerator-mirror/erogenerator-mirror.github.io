She replied with a smile.</p> <p>The girls laughed and shook their heads with little giggles. He could see that it was getting to them.</p> <p>"I think we'll have to make a sandwich. We've both had a little too much to drink," she sighed.</p> <p>"What do you think?"</p> <p>"A diet?"</p> <p>"That's right, we both love diet," he grinned.</p> <p>"You sure do," she smiled back at him as she turned her back on him and pulled her shirt out of her jeans and handed it to him.</p> <p>"I think we'll eat dinner with your dick in my ass," she snickered.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want to do this?" he thought to himself. I mean you want to fuck my ass or are you sure?" He grinned back as he turned to walk towards the door.</p> <p>She took a deep breath and looked back over her shoulder at him holding the door open.</p> <p>"I'll be right here," she purred as she turned back on him.</p> <p>"Is the door back there locked?"</p> <p>"Definitely not," she giggled softly.</p> <p>He turned and walked down the hall and she followed him down the stairs. He stopped when he caught a smell from her underwear as she opened the door. She leaned against him as he held her and kissed her deeply. This woman was different. She was different in his eyes as he looked at her dressed in her tight jeans, panties, bra and her top which he unbuttoned when he caught her looking at him. His cock was hard at this turn of events and his head hung down, looking down at her beautiful long legs and high heel shoes. She let him kiss her and rub her pussy thru her jeans for a minute and when she pushed him back and got to her feet, she took his hand and put it right next to her panties.</p> <p>"Just take off your pants," she said as she slowly pulled them down and kicked them off.</p> <p>"Your panties too," he said as he pulled them off her.</p> <p>"I didn't take them off, I just lifted them up," she corrected him.</p> <p>"I'll be right back with something to eat, we have plenty of time."</p> <p>"Just one thing, how about you eat me first?" she asked as she reached inside her bra and unfastened her brassiere.</p> <p>"Oh yeah," he grunted as he sat down at the dining room table.</p> <p>She kneeled and began to rub his dick all over her face. He leaned back and closed his eyes as she gently sucked his head. He felt her mouth as she began to explore one side of his shaft with her tongue, her mouth moving up and down his length until it began to swell in her mouth. She wrapped her lips tightly around the head of his cock and began to suck on it as she slowly squeezed the skin around the head. He didn't notice she pulled up and looked up to see himself in the mirror. He saw himself bent over licking her pussy and then he realized that she had his face buried in her pussy. Her legs were spread wide and her hands were gripping the backs of his legs. He couldn't see very well because of the angle but he could make out the shape of her pussy lips and her clit. When he looked up again, she was looking like an angel standing on her knees as she leaned her head back and let her pussy move up and down on his tongue. Just when he thought it couldn't get any better, he felt himself grow even more and he began to moan her name. She was obviously getting off on this turn of events and was working her pussy muscles tightly on his tongue. He held on for dear life as she started to rock herself on his face.</p> <p>Finally, she stopped and stood up with a loud sigh.</p> <p>"Do you think I'm ready for you to eat me now?"</p> <p>"Definitely. It's time for you to eat some pussy."</p> <p>As he walked on down around the pool house, she pulled on his hand and walked over to the pool house. She bent down and looked at him. He saw herself in the mirror as she stood before him. Her hair fell over her shoulders and she wore short, yellow shorts and a low-cut shirt. She stood just in front of him. He felt his dick begin to grow in his pants again. She looked at him and grinned.</p> <p>"Well, is your dick as hard as it is now?"</p> <p>"Yes, it's still," he smiled.</p> <p>"But what would you do if I stopped right now, please," she gaspedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
