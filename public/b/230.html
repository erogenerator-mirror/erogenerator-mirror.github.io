When I could see neither side of her face or body anymore, I stood up quickly.</p> <p>"I'll go in and turn the lights on" I said as I pulled away from her.</p> <p>She looked at me and I saw that her lips were moist and she knew exactly what she had to do. She opened her mouth and touched her tongue to her lips. Our tongues met and our body heat was like burning oil against flesh and skin. I pulled her close to me and she wrapped her legs around me and we slowly and tenderly ground our bodies together and moaned softly into each other's mouth. Once we touched, we both stopped to savor the taste of each other.</p> <p>I turned her around and she pulled me to her and we kissed hungrily, her tongue darting in and out of my mouth with every kiss. She pushed her hands down my back and pressed me against the wall. We kissed some more while my hands roamed over her back, squeezing, searching, pinching and stroking. She leaned her head back and I pulled her body close to mine. I took one of her nipples between my thumb and forefinger and pulled it gently. She moaned and put her hands on the back of my head, pressing me tight against her and feeling my body harden and respond to her touch.</p> <p>We broke our embrace and she looked down at my erection which caused her to groan softly. She leaned back and brought her hand down to her knee but I stopped her. She looked around the room at all of the lights, lights, candles and everything else in the room, even though our eyes met. I grabbed my hard dick from outside of my shorts and led her back into the room. She followed willingly.</p> <p>"Are you ready to join me, Jason?" she whispered.</p> <p>"Ready for what?" I responded.</p> <p>She didn't answer. She stood up and turned around. I stood close to her with my dick pointing right at the small of her back. My hands slid down her arms and took each of her breasts. We caressed them and squeezed them as we kissed. I bent my head down and captured one of her nipples in my mouth and sucked on it gently.</p> <p>She pulled me over to the bed and we fell on it, kissing and letting our hands find their way every way over each other's body.</p> <p>"I have a surprise for you, Jason." she said. "Will you help me hold onto that, too?"</p> <p>I leaned down and kissed her again. "I'll be right down." I said.</p> <p>I got rid of my shorts and we went back to her on the bed.</p> <p>"Do you want the rest of me?" she said.</p> <p>"Very much, I'll take care of you if you like," I replied.</p> <p>She smiled and laid back on the bed and opened her legs for me. My eyes moved from her feet up to her pussy.</p> <p>"I'm very wet and ready" I responded. "Is that what you want from me?"</p> <p>"Oh yes! Absolutely, please."</p> <p>I leaned over and took her nipple between my teeth and sucked it softly like a baby's as my fingers dipped into her pussy to play with her clit.</p> <p>"Oh Jason, yes!" she moaned. "Put your cock in me. Please, put it in me!"</p> <p>I slid my finger in her and found her g-spot easily with two fingers. She arched her back and let out a deep sigh of pleasure as I found that sensitive spot. I took my hand away from her clit and inserted my fingers along with them. She groaned again as she felt me inside of her. She grabbed the back of my head and pulled me into her with every stroke of my fingers. I held her hips and moved my pelvis up and down, grinding against her legs just as she pulled me to her harder. Our bodies moved against each other's rhythm as we heard the noises of the other's passion filling the room.</p> <p>"Are you close?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes!" I responded.</p> <p>"Then give in. Take me! I want you in me!"</p> <p>I knew that I would be in her in a heartbeat. She wrapped her legs around me and ground her hips back into mine.</p> <p>"Make me yours!" she moaned.</p> <p>I lifted her knees and let them drop off the sides of the bed and then I placed her feet at the top corner of the bed. I moved back down and began kissing and licking her thighs and her calf. I kissed my way to her knee and her skin crawled over mine with each lick.
