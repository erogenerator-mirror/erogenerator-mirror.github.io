I said, "I could just slip in the wetness of your lips." My fingers continued to stroke my throbbing nub, sending shivers through my body.</p> <p>"You're a very beautiful woman." He said, in what I hope was not a seductive tone.</p> <p>Suddenly another wave of warm pleasure washed over me, my heart raced. I had been so close and had let my arousal run free. He seemed to sense this, and leaned forward to take a nipple into his mouth. I let out a cry of shock and lust.</p> <p>When he sucked on my nipple, I thought I had experienced an orgasm. It was as if the universe had just let me go completely. My pussy clenched and unclenched around his fingers. He could feel my body convulse as his teeth lightly scraped my nipple. I was close to coming, he had teased me, not bitten, yet again. There were things I wanted to do to please him and my mouth gaped open in utter ecstasy. He removed his lips from my nipple. The look of pleasure, excitement, and lust in his eyes, made my head reel.</p> <p>Slowly my body relaxed, its muscles seemed to shake in response to him. I could not move. I could feel so much. He gently pushed my legs part and slid the tip of his dripping wet cock inside of me, and we both moaned in pleasure. I held him tight as he began to move. He fucked me as if I wasn't there. He was so tight and so warm. He was so warm! The room was filled with the sound of slapping flesh. My body seemed to tingle. It took every ounce of control to do this to him, even if it was as simple as this.</p> <p>He began to move slowly in and out, in and out. Each stroke made me wetter. I felt myself responding to him, wanting to feel him in me everywhere, everywhere. I never wanted him to stop!</p> <p>"Oh my God, I'm so close!" I cried. He was pumping in and out of me as if I was a cock. He was so much bigger! My head began to spin. I was close to exploding!!</p> <p>"Oh! Oh! Oh!" I cried. He was fucking me more, faster than I've ever been fucked before, not once, but twice. "Ahhhh! Oh God. You have to fuck me harder. I've never been so full!" I pleaded. "Yes! Yes!"</p> <p>I don't think we've come yet, but at one point he was pounding me so hard, so hard I thought my toes were going to cut themselves, just to come. He pushed me back against the mattress, and I felt him inside of me. There were no words to describe this feeling. I could barely breath, I barely felt my toes curling up, I just felt the waves of pleasure washing over me, so intense I could feel it all.</p> <p>When I finally caught my breath, he was breathing heavy, so hard. I wanted to kiss him, I needed to feel his cock. But the reality of this all being so different was to be seen in a moment. I knew what was going on, and I didn't want it to happen, but I didn't want to stop it. It had been so wonderful. "Honey, stop," I whispered. "We still have a while."</p> <p>He took a deep breath and sat back. "Damn, I love fucking you," he said, still breathing hard. "You can do anything just fuck me! You were incredible!" he added.</p> <p>"I am sure we'll find something to do with that." I smiled.</p> <p>"I believe I'm going to have a glass of wine right now." He laughed.</p> <p>"Where do you want to sit, love?" I asked.</p> <p>"My bedroom, where is it?" he said, moving the bottle from his lips.</p> <p>"That's very tempting." I said, my voice quivering with emotion.</p> <p>"You're insufferable!" he said as he stood, walking over to my side of the bed.</p> <p>I grabbed him by the ass and pulled him in. The feel of his rigid cock against my hand sent a shiver running through my body all over again. "I need you in me! Now!" I whispered. "I haven't been fucked so many times!"</p> <p>"No, no, I will not make love to a girl, I will be making love to you!" he said as he took my head in his hands and kissed me.</p> <p>His lips felt so wonderful! And his mouth was so gentle! "Can we go slow?" I asked. He agreed, "Let's think about it, then, let's just enjoy it."</p> <p>"That can beâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
