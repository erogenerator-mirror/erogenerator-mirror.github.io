We have our own little home, and I'm only here to share my love with you," Katya said softly</p> <p>He laughed as he saw her look away. She wanted more than just this simple gesture. She needed to have a loving man. He needed to be loved by a woman. Katya wanted to spend hours making love to a man.</p> <p>"You are so sweet," he murmured.</p> <p>"It's been a long time since I talked to someone who could be so thoughtful."</p> <p>"I'm just being sweet. I wanted you for your own reasons."</p> <p>"I have always been a very loving and caring kind of person. I was just waiting for a chance to say yes."</p> <p>"Well now here's my chance," he said as he ran his fingers between her breasts. She gasped slightly as he flicked her nipples.</p> <p>"Yes," she replied with a giggle. Her smile was as wide as she could manage.</p> <p>"Then I'll take you to my bed," he whispered. He turned around.</p> <p>"I have no doubt that I'm going to give you the best damn cock you'll ever have; any cock your choice; and to take you to your bed, you will beg to be mine. Then tomorrow, I'm going to give you a choice; I can take all of you," he said as he kissed her quickly.</p> <p>She smiled sweetly as she hugged him tightly. She felt as close to him as she had that last time.</p> <p>"I'll call you tomorrow and do as you wish - and more in future. There will be plenty of time left in this long relationship."</p> <p>"Then tomorrow, my sexy beautiful love, there is no tomorrow for you. You will always be mine, and you will have the happiest ending to our long sexual relationship!"</p> <p>With that he kissed her again, and pulled away.</p> <p>"I love you!" he whispered.</p> <p>"I love you as well," she answered back.</p> <p>When the kiss ended it was her turn and Katya held his head, pulling him into her body, and began to kiss him softly. He felt her body relax against him, and then she suddenly pushed him away as she broke the kiss. The tears flowed down her cheeks as she looked up into his eyes.</p> <p>"I think I'm falling in love with you. I don't know what it is now, but if you're going to go with me, then let's try again."</p> <p>"I am falling in love with you, as well," he promised her.</p> <p>"I didn't just say that. Take me for all of eternity if you don't like this. I'm not that hungry or that drunk."</p> <p>"If you change your mind I'm going to kill you. You just don't want me here yet, do you?" he said teasingly, while smiling down at her.</p> <p>"No, I was just going to go with you now," she said with a smile. She wanted to tell him they would go through life together like that. But she didn't want to risk falling head over heels if it meant having sex with someone else, and not spending the rest of their life together.</p> <p>"That's not what you expect me to do!"</p> <p>"I'm sorry you had to think that," she blushed. "But you are too smart to be having a bad relationship with someone with a negative attitude of yours."</p> <p>"What a sad contrast to a relationship with a person as beautiful as you! I love you for what you do for me, for all of us!"</p> <p>"I'm your one and only love now, my friend. I will always love you." she felt so happy.</p> <p>"If you change your mind, I'm not happy about tonight."</p> <p>"Don't worry," Katya said, as she hugged him back to her. "I'll do whatever you want me to."</p> <p>"I never expected it either. You didn't disappoint me," he said looking into her eyes. "I hope I make you happy."</p> <p>"I hope so. That's the only thing I want!" she told him as she pulled his face down to hers.</p> <p>Katya kissed him softly and moved her hand down his chest and stomach as she leaned down to kiss him again. This time she kissed him deeply, while holding him tight against her body. When she broke off to suck and bite his lower lip she smiled softly, and kissed him again.</p> <p>"I'm starving," she told him.</p> <p>"Me too. Let's eat," he said as he pulled her up and took her into his arms.</p> <p>"You still have to eat before we go to sleep, but it should take you an hour to walkâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
