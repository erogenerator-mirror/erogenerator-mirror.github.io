I asked, knowing she would have to think of something, even knowing this girl, or that's what he intended to do to her.</p> <p>"Now," she said. "Just come again. You can fuck me now and then, and I'll suck your cock to orgasm. That's all right."</p> <p>"You can suck my cock? Right here and now? That will be great. I think you're a pro." I told her, and she agreed. "Now, let's have a look." She took off her clothes and stood in front of me, looking into my eyes as she looked into mine. "Come here," she said, and I moved to her. She turned, put her arms around my neck and pulled herself against me. I pressed against her harder. The kiss was wonderful. She held my face with her hands and kissed me again, harder than the first time, so when I was done kissing her, as soon as her lips let go, I moved my lips to her neck, moving my hand to her breasts, cupping them and tweaking her nipple between my fingers. She didn't protest, and she didn't stop me from squeezing her breasts. As hard as I was, my cock was already at its full length.</p> <p>"You have nice breasts," I said, and she replied with a nod.</p> <p>"They are sensitive," she said, "and I love feeling them. And I love making love with you. Kiss me again. Kiss my lips now."</p> <p>"I like kissing your mouth," I said, "I like making you come. It's been a while." And I moved my mouth to rest on hers, sucking on her lower lip, enjoying the taste of her lipstick. I sucked the lips further apart, opened my mouth a little, and slipped my tongue inside her mouth, tasting her own saliva and her lipstick. I kissed her again, my hand cupping her breasts, my finger pinching her nipple. The movement of her arm and her head was doing things to my cock I had never felt before, which she was quickly discovering as her hand moved in my pants. "I just love kissing you," I told her, "or any place else, for that matter."</p> <p>"Mmmm, it's nice kissing you," she said, "like this." She looked down at my hard on. "Like that." She stroked me for a moment, then said "If you don't mind, I'd like to go upstairs and change my costume, if you want. I've worn them before, and they are really pretty. I just don't think they like women that way in." She kissed me again, and as I stood there in my shorts and tank top, she unbuttoned her dress. "This will work," she said, and stepped into it. She turned around and put it with her shirt. When she turned, she had another piece of cloth around her neck, in which I now could see her breasts, but not her panties. "Not bad," she said, "not bad." I smiled, and she kissed me again. She opened the front of the panties, revealing a neatly trimmed bush of light brown fuzz. It was so soft and silky, like a freshly washed flower that got very little attention from the men in my life. My eyes were fixed on her body, admiring the way her breasts rose and fell in anticipation. Her stomach was trim and curvy, with not a crevice to be seen, but not so large that it was hard for me to imagine that she had a pussy as thin as hers. "I like your pussy," she said, and we kissed again. "I really love it," I said, and we went back to the bedroom, leaving her to take off her costume, and I did the same. "My clothes are in over here," she said, "and we'll have to get you one of these clothes." She grabbed the new white lace dress, which was not completely transparent, but was probably less than a few layers, and put it on. She looked at me. "I think it looks really good on you," she said, "and if your clothes are decent, I may want to put something on too." I put my shorts and shirt on, and we went back out, her new panties in hand. "Now, what's your plan for us this evening?" I asked. She looked at me again. "We're going somewhere with no commitment," she said. "Why don't you just come back and meet me downstairs?"</p> <p>"Is that where you are?" I asked, wanting to go back there in just my boxers, which were still tented with my hard on.</p> <p>"Yeah. We are going to a club. A few more clubs down that way. We're going to have a good time. We'll have fun and I'll be back, and I'llâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
