You better get her, because she is going to be watching the football."</p> <p>"Yes ma'am. I'll get you."</p> <p></p> <p>My mind was racing, as I approached the door. I heard the sounds of his heavy boots on the gravel driveway as he walked across the grass toward me. My heart raced as I watched him pass. What was going on here? Had he changed her mind? Or had I just missed out?</p> <p>He walked around me slowly as if I had been in the middle of conversation. He had a big hard-on that told me he had done this before. He turned me around sharply at the door; then continued to approach me with his body at eye level. I felt his face brush mine in a teasing way and for a brief moment I thought I heard a woman moan but couldn't be sure. I felt his hands begin to rubs my arms with lotion and I let a little moan escape my lips.</p> <p>My hands moved over to his waist as his body continued to rub my arms. My hands began to move over his chest to his stomach and hips as his other hand moved underneath mine; pushing two fingers into my panties and finding my wet pussy. I spread my legs and lifted one of them exposing his hard shaft. I gasped at the thought of it in my pussy and could only whimper as he entered me. I let out a breath of delight at the tight feeling of him filling me as his hips began to move and move as his cock buried itself in me with every thrust.</p> <p>I felt him begin to slow but he kept trying to make everything last as long as possible. I loved hearing him panting and asking me if I was happy just the way I was. "Is love making your body complete?" He was very calm as he asked and asked.</p> <p>He leaned in to kiss me, and I opened my legs enough for him to slip inside me. I was so wet from anticipation that he made me feel wonderful inside. He held me up as he lifted me slightly off the ground. The moment we broke our embrace he looked me in the eyes as his erection slipped out of me and began to rub the head against my swollen lips. "Your mother was a cheer leader too," he began.</p> <p>"Please no," I pleaded. "I don't want this."</p> <p>"You're the only one in this house that is still in charge tonight so you can call me master and do as you want. Is your mother on birth control again?"</p> <p>I was stunned by his question, yet at the same time I knew if I had asked him or if he didn't want this I would either just stop or find other ways of stopping the pain that it was caused at the moment so to speak.</p> <p>"I'd love it if you would let me do this for you." The moment that passed between me and him was one where I could not think straight and just wanted him to touch me but the feeling of his cock filling my pussy and moving inside me only increased my fear and excitement.</p> <p>"We are going to change the subject soon," he said as his cock slid back inside me. He knew exactly what the problem was and how to fix it as he used the force of him inside. I felt so wicked and wanted more. The feeling was so pleasurable and so good too that I was able to let myself enjoy it with him.</p> <p>"What do you want from me?" I asked.</p> <p>"I want you to tell me the true reason why I want a child."</p> <p>I thought I knew what he meant, but at the moment I didn't know if I wanted to hear it.</p> <p>"If you only told me."</p> <p>"The truth, or the wrong way? That I want to have kids?" he said with just as much of a pained look.</p> <p>I thought for a moment like I had just seen someone who had just had the best sex of his life. "What do mean if you want children? We have talked about it already."</p> <p>"I would feel that way. My mother is pregnant," he said as I looked at him.</p> <p>He started to move again as he took my hands and gently pulled me back to him. "The truth, or the right way to explain," again I hesitated only a moment. "But it is important to understand that I also want to have kids. I'm married. Who are you married to?"</p> <p>"I'm a doctor. I've been to see some of your patients that are about to be in labor to make babies. I'm not a child-molester. I wanted you to just be your normal healthy young man until one day you decide you want more children in a relationship," he said as his hands moved up to myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
