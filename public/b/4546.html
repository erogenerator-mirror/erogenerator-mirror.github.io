"But why don't you let me know what you have in mind."</p> <p>"Well, let's just say that I'm in the mood to be adventurous. It's been just a couple of months since our last trip and it's been hard to say no to you," she replied with a wink.</p> <p>I couldn't believe how much she was just asking for it all. I took a few moments to compose myself before I let her put her dress back on. After all the fun I had with her last night, getting her to do that was about the highlight of the day. It was a shame that I had left her alone so before we went back to our hotel she gave me my very best goodbye kiss before slipping the dress back on. Then she turned to go back to our room but then stopped.</p> <p>"Uh… well, no, not tonight, I have a business meeting in a bit," she said rather sadly. "My hubby isn't looking forward to being seen out with me."</p> <p>"Sorry, it's just… the thought of you and another man has crossed my mind. Don't worry about it. I love your husband more than you'll ever understand. But it won't end well. It's just another one of your own little fantasies," I said with a comforting smile. "Just let it go for now."</p> <p>With that she was gone and I took the rest of the day off and spent it thinking about a surprise that I had in store for me this evening. I went up to my suite and opened a bottle of red wine while I waited for my bride. It had a little extra cork to add a little spice. When it arrived, it took all of 15 minutes to bring the finishing glass to my lips to the sound of the music. I had my hand in my pocket, waiting anxiously for the right moment to touch myself.</p> <p>I was on top of the bed when I heard the door open. At first I thought that something was a bit out of place, but then I noticed the familiar glint in my eyes as the door was fully open. I almost got up to greet her when she walked through. The lights dimmed further and more candles played as well, just like I had planned. That had to have been the surprise I was in for tonight. I was still in just my underwear, with a towel covering my face and a robe hanging off my shoulder when I heard the voice of my bride softly saying that it was now time for her to get dressed. She was standing in front of the full-length mirror in the bathroom and started applying her makeup, taking a moment to look directly into the mirror to try to make her look a bit wilder than she had always had been.</p> <p>"You look great," I heard her say as she got ready to pull a sexy strapless top out from her bag. That she liked to wear around the house. "And don't worry." She continued to walk out into the bedroom where she picked up the small black bag laying on the edge of the bed. "You look so sexy I just want you for myself."</p> <p>I smiled at her and stood up, pulling the robe on and giving my bride another peck before giving her a quick hug. "You look beautiful," I said. "I know you're going to make me cum just by looking at you tonight."</p> <p>She smiled and responded by giving me a quick kiss on the cheek. "It's okay. I know you don't have to, but you're right you do need to cum," she said as she looked down. "So I guess you're ready for this one."</p> <p>I stood up as well, as she reached for what I could pick up from the desk in our room. I knew that she loved to have a bit more to drink, so I figured I could probably put my hands on her from behind while holding her. I wanted to see what kind of reaction I could get when I brought her to orgasm. I was definitely ready.</p> <p>She stood up, putting her arms around my neck as close as she could get and kissed me on the cheek. "You okay?" she asked, looking me in the eye as she rubbed her hand over my cock through the fabric of my robe.</p> <p>I just nodded in response. "I'm almost ready," I replied in return. With that, she turned to run to the bathroom.</p> <p>I took a few steps back and watched her sexy hips sway as she walked. My cock was already swelling as I approached with a growing smile on my mouth. I could have cared less if she got caught up in the moment for the first time, but I wanted her to know that her body could be for me to—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
