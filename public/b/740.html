I reached over and flipped her on to her back. I lifted her legs, pushed them back together and entered her again. I knew she liked it, as she wrapped her head around my cock. We were both panting in the bed. We looked into each other's eyes. I lowered my lips to hers, kissed her lips and sucked her lips. We made out passionately. Her breasts, heaving for air and her erect nipples.</p> <p>I put my hands on her buttocks, pulling her against me, and my cock went in and out of her hole. "Oh yes, my love," I said. "Fuck me and make me feel good." God, I love a woman when she cums that fast.</p> <p>Then we switched again, this time a little faster. This was what she liked and needed and it was driving her wild. We were both hot for each other, and knew exactly where to touch each other. Her pussy was so wet and slippery. I kissed her neck and mouth, she kissed my neck and face. I sucked her right nipple while I slowly moved on top of her body. She pulled my head in by the hair, and I slid my cock right back and forth. She was on the verge and I knew I wanted to come.</p> <p>I pulled her ass so my dick would slide in. "Come for me," I said, "come for my wife. Fill my mind with love."</p> <p>"Oh please," she begged as I slid in and out of her. I was trying to hold back. "Don't come in me. I love you," she said, and I could feel her hands on my ass again. She was squeezing it so strong that she wanted all my cum to shoot in her. She pulled me closer, I could feel her breasts on my arms. I knew I wouldn't last long and I did not want it to end. I wanted to do this for her. I held on for the ride, and when I did there was a scream of desire from all of us. We had an orgasm together. We came together and collapsed onto the bed. It was amazing.</p> <p>We lay there, recovering until I saw her smiling face. We broke our embrace, looked at each other and smiled back. Then she turned on her back, pulled up her nightgown, her arms out for me and she kissed me long and long. I felt her naked skin, and her breasts, which had a beautiful size. I kissed her cheeks to open her eyes, and kiss her lips again. I reached for her and held myself against her and went in her for a few minutes.</p> <p>I broke from spooning her and turned my head to kiss her and then her neck and chest. I took off my night gown and placed it over her shoulders and we were completely naked! "Take my clothes off. I don't want a woman to touch my skin." My wife was beautiful naked. I love her body. I loved to please her. I don't know if I wanted to have sex with her or leave her alone. I don't care. I loved her body.</p> <p>I had been lying on my back for the minute of the kiss. I thought I sensed something then, but just went with it. "I want to fuck you," I said when we were a piece.</p> <p>"What you going to do?" she said with a coy smile.</p> <p>"Just lay there and enjoy," I said in a husky voice that conveyed my wife's love. I was very serious in my thoughts. I could feel her naked body against mine. Her body was hot to me, and I wanted to fuck it. I wanted to fuck her all, and make her my woman. I could feel my cock hardening against her legs. I wanted to fuck her.</p> <p>She sat on me and my cock went into her. When I looked again she was on her side with her hand on her breast, so I put my hand on her. I rubbed her breast and it felt nice. Her body pressed against me and made me want her. I kissed her on the neck and she held me a little tighter. I was very excited. She was on my mind, not just mine. I needed to feel her. I wanted to have her.</p> <p>She was on her side with her arm over mine as we kissed. I moved my hand to one breast, put it over the nipple and felt it, and squeezed it softly. It made her moan. I rolled the nipple in my fingers, pulled it and her body made the same noises I did. I started to kiss her throat and the shoulder, and then my way down. Her neck was soft and smooth. I kissed a trail down to her breast. "Do it," she said. I kissed the nipple and she got a little louder. I kissedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
