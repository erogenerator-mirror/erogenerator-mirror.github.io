"I was thinking about using the toy on that lovely body."</p> <p>As he moved to stand back a moment, I noticed the thin black strap of a whip at the other end of the bed's head. He had been teasing me ever since I found the leather strap on the bedspread at the end of the bed – I had never given him one – which he had kept in a plastic bag beside the bed. This one was not the sort of thing a real man would use. This was very different, the whip was much like the one which he had used on me on him with only a small gash in the flesh. I had never seen anything like it before in my life. He moved the strap behind himself, making sure that there was no risk of me touching it and then held it out towards me.</p> <p>"Here are your options," I replied without thinking. "Put your ass onto the strap and get ready for it."</p> <p>I picked the whip up slowly and placed it against my ass. It was a lovely implement of leather I had often fantasised about using on my lovers. I had a very naughty idea about what it would feel like to be tied up, but never tried it.</p> <p>"Open your back." He said, moving around some more and then coming back to my body. He held the strap in place with both hands.</p> <p>"Wider." He said, placing the whip on top of my left thigh.</p> <p>I felt the cold leather rubbing on my skin at first. He was massaging my skin as the strap touched ever closer to my ass. I could feel the vibrations of the whip, the heat and the strength of the whip as it worked its way along my skin. The vibrations caused the strap on to shift slightly causing a shudder to pass through my body. I was getting more turned on, being teased and controlled. All this time the straps on the blindfold were playing against my skin. I was still in the doghouse when he started to stroke my left leg with the leather strap. It was warm and erotic as it moved up and down my leg the way they had been stroking me. He started off with the whip, but had quickly changed it back down and left it at my thigh again. Each stroke he went up caused his body to move up and down my legs at the same time. I was getting more and more aroused by his touches, the intensity of which I had never dreamed was ever possible. Then suddenly, he stopped and brought the other strap down on my other leg.</p> <p>"This will be the 'nudge' I have been waiting for." He said, pulling on the strap and putting it on.</p> <p>I felt both of his hands run up the top of my thighs to the top of my crotch.</p> <p>"Lift your hips off the bed." He told me. "But stay bent forward until I turn you around. When I am ready."</p> <p>I was now in a situation where I could hardly move in my bonds. My lower body was stretched out over the bed with my lower body almost lying flat on the mattress. My ass was at the end of the bed and the straps in the floor was on my ankles. My legs were wide apart and my wrists were being bound behind me. I could feel how the leather straps in the floor were running back and forth between my legs, making my legs move and my pussy squirm and swell slightly. I could feel the tension, both on my upper and lower body and between my legs. I was in that vulnerable state of being where I knew nothing could stop me except letting my mind wander into the fantasy, but knowing that nothing could undo what my body of this new-found sexuality was trying to offer me. He brought my legs together again, trapping the strap between my ankles.</p> <p>The sensation I gave at that moment – so near to feeling like it was going to come apart – was like nothing I had ever felt before in my life. I was ready for anything. I knew that I was ready. He stood up behind me, running the tip of his cock over my ass and balls. The sensations I was already feeling were so intense, so incredible, almost indescribable.</p> <p>I was not sure I could take much more. I had never felt anything so intense in my life, even close and I was getting closer. I felt the tip of his cock at my asshole again. It was so big. He slowly pressed it in without the aid of his normal lubricating touch. It touched that very spot that I loved my cock to be so close to, and then I felt the pressure, the need, the need to be stretched and used by him. I let out a low moan, but I could barely speak, as the gag was still in place, so my only words were a whim—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
