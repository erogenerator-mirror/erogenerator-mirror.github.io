"I've always loved my sister because of her personality, and I've always loved you too. You're my most significant gift. I just wish we could live together forever."</p> <p>"I know that too. I can't ever make up my mind. That's why I didn't tell you yesterday or this summer. You've been a friend, and I can't do anything to change that."</p> <p>"You're not going to change that are you?"</p> <p>"No, not just for me. I'm just trying."</p> <p>"Okay, okay," she said. "Do you want to do this now, or wait until we're married?"</p> <p>"I'd rather have sex today," he said, stroking his hands up and down her stomach.</p> <p>"Then I want to have sex now," she said, pressing her body onto his, their naked bodies writhing together as their breathing quickened and their lips met in a passionate exchange of words.</p> <p>Her body responded by grinding faster and faster against him, his heart pounding and his hands tightening on her, both of them getting close to the edge before they would explode in bliss together, but not quite there yet.</p> <p>"Oh, God. I want to get laid right now," he growled, his breath was hot on her throat. "Do you want me right now?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"And if it's okay with you with another man?"</p> <p>"I'd prefer not."</p> <p>"Do it! Do it right. Fuck my brains out!"</p> <p>Hilary let out a gasp as she felt him drive himself deep inside her. "Yes. God, I'm so full! I'm so full! Don't stop!" she groaned, leaning up on her arms after wrapping her arms around his neck, her legs around his waist.</p> <p>Hilary wrapped her legs around his waist and held on for dear life, trying to drive him deeper into her with every thrust. He held her close to him, her legs twined tightly around his waist.</p> <p>They finally came to a stop, both panting and gasping for air.</p> <p>"How do we do it?" she asked, looking up at him with lust-glazed eyes.</p> <p>"I want to sit right here on your back with you pressed down on me. Would you like that?"</p> <p>"I'd love to," she said, squeezing herself even tighter around his body.</p> <p>"Then let me get my shirt off and..."</p> <p>"Hold on."</p> <p>They scrambled out into the bedroom and he quickly pulled off his clothes, her panties and their t-shirts, leaving them on the floor with the rest of their clothes. He looked in her eyes the entire time, and she couldn't look away. They had never been this close together, and never felt this right about each other.</p> <p>She reached out and took his face in her hands. There was no mistaking what she wanted: a kiss. As he kissed her deeply, she slid down him, and pulled him up so she could take off her shirt. As she slid out of them and lay back he slid down on her, the sight of his beautiful nude body contrasted against hers for many moments.</p> <p>"I've wanted to do this this way for a long time," she murmured.</p> <p>"Me too."</p> <p>"Want me to lick you?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Do you want me to fuck you?" he whispered in her ear.</p> <p>"Yes. Yes."</p> <p>He moved down her body, tasting her flesh on his fingers, before leaning down to kiss her and then slide down again on top of her again, feeling her legs go around his waist and her arms hold him tightly to her as his erection slid along the length of her and against her thigh.</p> <p>"I love making you feel good," he murmured in her ear, his tongue circling the other earlobe.</p> <p>Hilary felt him slip from her, and then her legs closed around his hips, pulling him into her.</p> <p>"Oh, God," she cried, as his thickness filled her.</p> <p>He began to move inside of her slowly, and she wrapped her arms around his neck and held on for dear life as her body took him inside.</p> <p>He wanted to be perfectly still, to just lay there and savor every delightful sensation, every kiss, every lick and every stroke. It didn't seem as long as they normally had been together, though.</p> <p>And when she felt him slip inside her once more she felt a little less empty this time.
