We were having dinner and she had come home early and we were watching a movie on cable. At 1 in the evening, she came in and said, "I hope we do not miss the reservation."</p> <p>"Let's make it as quick as we can," I told her as we moved past the dining room table. I went into the dinning room and got a wine-poured out.</p> <p>"I am not sure you remember what it is," she said, "I am so happy I can't find the word for it."</p> <p>She was on the couch. We had a nice view as I poured her her favorite wine.</p> <p>"I am glad tonight has been so nice for you, honey," I told her as I pulled my face in close to hers.</p> <p>"You have already had so much," she gushed over the last hour and a half.</p> <p>I knew that she had some good news to tell me.</p> <p>"I have never done it with another man before and certainly not with my husband. It is exciting for me to know that I can do this with another man but never in a normal relationship," she said.</p> <p>Well it was like that. We had all the time in the world, but that didn't mean many things. We had been married for over 25 years when I started to worry about sex.</p> <p>She looked at me with a look of disappointment. "I am still worried about our marriage. You have shown no signs of stopping, at least for about a year. You love me no matter what, and I love you."</p> <p>"I guess you would just say we might have to stop," I whispered to her through our glasses.</p> <p>At the same time, she looked at my face, smiled, and said, "but if we ever get pregnant we shouldn't!"</p> <p>The champagne was a bit unsteady and our drinks were gone in the second or third glass. I sat back and just relaxed for the first twenty-five minutes of the evening. Beth was in full flirt mode by the time we moved to the sofa.</p> <p>As we started to remove our pants, my wife said, "I know it has been a long time but it is a very long time and I don't want anything that is going to happen that we would never want our marriage to be broken, for any reason. Can we keep this light?"</p> <p>I looked at her and said, "let's think about it and what will happen. If we decide not to be married for as long as this weekend we will talk about it. But the best thing to do is let me know in a minute or two if we are going to be married. For now, you can look forward to tonight as a big celebration for a good long while."</p> <p>I walked her to her couch and we sat there for a while and talked. We spent the next hour or so in kissing and rubbing each other and watching each movie.</p> <p>I started the conversation the night after we had been married three years and then we talked about the evening. Our plans for the day fell asleep soon afterward and we went to bed about 2 hours later. Once again, we both fell asleep happy. As we were spooning, I said, " I hope tonight is a really big thing because the last thing I want you to think for yourself what your future has in store for me. When I said you will have time for me or other men, I was right. I love you dearly and I wish your future were as happy as ours is."</p> <p>"I know," she whispered back. "I love you too and we can't even think about going back to seeing other men again."</p> <p>"So, do you want to be married?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Yes," she said.</p> <p>"It doesn't have to be a lot until you do," I said. "You are a mature and responsible and you have always been a very sexy woman. But if we don't feel comfortable with something like this we can stop. We will just get married or not at our wedding."</p> <p>She nodded her agreement. "We need to talk about this, right now. We can stop, or if we feel it is necessary we can continue or if it feels right to continue. Do you want to make love?"</p> <p>"Yes," I whispered back. "God, I want to make love to you." I slipped down off of the sofa and rolled her onto her back. I knelt between her legs and slipped my dick into her.</p> <p>I had a hard time concentrating as she kissed me passionately. As she continued to stroke me with her pussy I slipped my hands around her body and placed my fingers on her breast. She responded by running her fingers through my hair andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
