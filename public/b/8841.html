You were so beautiful in the afternoon." He said as his fingers began to play in her cleavage. She leaned forward against him, and he put a hand on each side of her face, and lifted her chin. She looked into his eyes, smiled a little shyly and nodded her head, and leaned close enough to kiss his cheek. "Did you get any sun?" he asked as he took her in his arms and pressed her against the bonnet of the car.</p> <p>"No, thank you, I just like to walk." she said. He was glad if she knew what she wanted he could be there for her. He had been looking forward to this for quite a while; now he had to get her alone, if only to make sure they both got as much sun as possible.</p> <p>"Well I think you're too beautiful to leave without sunning, let's go." he said as he started the car and they headed towards their destination. The warm summer day was already starting to look too inviting in the summer evening.</p> <p>Once they got to the beach, they walked hand in hand for a while, just enjoying the day. He found out that she was the owner, and her job was to collect their usual beach food and food on the weekend by hand. This weekend was going to be a great day for them both.</p> <p>"What time do I check on my phone?" she asked, trying to sound upbeat, but not sounding like one of her usual cheerful self. "I can't tell you when I have to do that."</p> <p>"Oh you want me to pick up some food there?" he innocently asked. He knew she never did anything on the weekends, and that she worked late and could do no other than pick up an hour early. "No, you don't need to ask. I can pick it up when I get done, and I'll return it later. Thanks, baby." he said as he got up to lock the car behind him and she closed the door. Once they were inside he pulled her close and bent down to kiss her. She leaned her head back and he placed his lips gently over hers, then pulled back slightly and kissed her cheek gently. He put his tongue lightly in her mouth, and she parted her lips to allow him in. A long deep kiss and his tongue worked their way into her mouth and he caressed her tongue with his mouth. He slid his own tongue into hers and caressed it with his.</p> <p>They broke their long kiss and they just smiled a happy smile at each other. He pulled her to him and ran his hands up her leg and back down, brushing her hips, her thighs and her knees so that they could grind into each other once again. By this time he was breathing heavily, and a slight amount of sweat had covered his body and the sand was beginning to run out of his ears. Without much ado he began to get her bikini bottoms off, and she let him. When he got them free he pulled them down, exposing a beautiful pussy, and just barely covering her lips. He slid his tongue into the wetness, and she moaned a little and writhed against him. He worked his tongue down the valley and she arched her back a little, enjoying the heat coming from the mouth of this beautiful girl. A man always liked to work a little more, so he started moving deeper. She arched her back again, and his other hand reached up, touching her breasts, and she moaned again.</p> <p>She pushed his head away and he got back to work. He could hear him sucking and licking and kissing her nipples, and he felt her body start to tighten and relax from his attentions.</p> <p>"Now it's getting you all hot." he groaned, trying to get her more aroused, now that she was moaning more.</p> <p>"Yes you know you're going to." she said, her voice barely above a whisper as she lifted her hips, trying to get his tongue lower. She raised off the bonnet of the car and he pulled away from her, sliding his hand down her stomach and to her pussy, and started to rub her lips for a minute, and then slipped a finger into her soaking wet pussy.</p> <p>"God, you are so wet!" he said, still rubbing up and down. Her juices were flowing freely now, and he fingered her, feeling her juices as he went and feeling the heat and wetness. "Do you like that?"</p> <p>"Oh God yes" she moaned softly as she got more excited. She had always wanted this, she had told him, but that was the best way to ask a man to make love to her. He wasn't surprised by her words, and did not have much of a problem playing around either. His fingers felt her juices lubricating her again, and he fingered her ever soâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
