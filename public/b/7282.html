"I'm so fucking wet for you!"</p> <p>With a smile I pull her into my arms once again and lay back to ride out her orgasm on top of whatever might have happened. It felt to me as though a dam burst inside me and I collapsed onto a couch pillow as I continued to fuck her harder.</p> <p>For a long time we stayed in this position for several minutes without saying or asking permission. If I didn't cum soon enough I'd have lost control, that was the whole point of the whole thing. When I finally opened my eyes again the two of us were locked together on the couch and my cock was as hard as iron. We both just looked at it as though we wanted to die at any moment. I couldn't even bring myself to say it. "How long?" I asked quietly.</p> <p>"A long time," she replied as the tension in her voice reached the breaking point. I grabbed her hand and led it to her pussy and she slowly slid her finger inside herself. "Aaaargh yessss!"</p> <p>I moaned even louder. "What should I do, Jen?" I tried to sound hurt.</p> <p>"Do whatever makes you cum," she purred. "I've fantasized about this for years. Just imagine you do this to me and feel it." She continued to play and slide her finger in and out of her slick pussy, as her head rolled back and forth on the couch pillow. "Tell me when you'd like me to do to you how it would be to have you lick me, lick my pussy, lick my clit..." Her finger picked up speed. She was breathing heavier and getting more and more aroused, as she kept on fucking herself. "If I could make you cum I'd fuck you until you passed out." I leaned forward on the opposite couch and put my ear against the wall as I reached to the cabinet she'd thrown off the side of the hall and unzipped it.</p> <p>"Oh wow." Her voice was barely audible as my hand came up to her face and gently turned her head up to look at me through the bedroom mirror above the end table. "I've only been out to dinner, but today really got me."</p> <p>"I'm glad you're not here," I lied. "Don't worry if you weren't wearing one of those silly little robes." I didn't tell her to be careful about it just in case it's been going on for a while. "I mean it's just you and me now." I pulled her to the door of the house a little ways and pulled my hand away from her face. We just stared at each other for a moment trying to determine how to continue this without breaking the eye contact. We were both breathing heavy as we tried to calm down.</p> <p>"I gotta tell you I don't think I'm going to sleep tonight."</p> <p>"Oh that? Are you kidding? I can hardly wait to watch those movies again."</p> <p>"Do you want me to sleep with you every day?" She was smiling broadly now, and it took every ounce of my willpower not to reach out to hug her. She didn't need to say it twice and her body seemed to be shaking as she leaned against me. "You know it's not fair that we'll never have the same dreams that we had these past few months, doesn't it?"</p> <p>"Well if we can have that, at least we'll have a chance to see the movies again. I mean you have to admit I'm not that bad...and I'm still getting used to the idea of you being the one doing this for me now."</p> <p>When she finally released me she kissed my cheek and turned to see my smiling face. "Yeah. That's pretty much what I have been thinking. I just wanna see it every day, to actually see how this is going for you." She leaned down and gave me a quick peck on the lips before closing the door behind her. We kissed for a while and then she was pulling me back toward her. "Now let's just sit there and watch those movies."</p> <p>We never went the normal route, and it was like this was our first and last date. She pulled me closer to the table and gave me a kiss of my own. "Don't even try to make up some stuff with me...even though you know I'd probably kill myself right now if you tried."</p> <p>"I'm not trying," I told her. "After your first time kissing me the other night I actually feel bad for missing that time and you've still not told me what to do." I sat up in the seat and put my hands on the edge of the table so that we could both sit right between the two end tables. â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
