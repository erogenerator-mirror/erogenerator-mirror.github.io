Our tongues touched. It was a new level of intimacy for us. I grabbed her ass and began to knead it. That was so erotic. Our wetness began to flow. My finger slid in and out of her. She had goose bumps from my touch and it gave me the confidence to reach deeper. I slipped two in with ease.</p> <p>She was still riding me and moving with me. I wanted this more than any of our previous orgasms. I pulled her to me and kissed her. Her head was on my shoulder. I turned us so I could see her. She could see the look of surprise and confusion in my eyes.</p> <p>Her eyes told me everything. I held her close to me and kissed her. Her eyes were as glass. It was as if she could see into my soul. When I said "I love you" her eyes held mine. I leaned to her ear and softly said softly, "I love you too."</p> <p>She pulled her hair aside and said, "I love you too." I wanted us to be together again.</p> <p>"I wish we could be together all of the time." She kissed me again. "But in the meantime," she whispered, "I think we need to do the dishes."</p> <p>We cleaned ourselves again. Then I went to the kitchen and got our wash cloths. I dried her up and helped her get out of her clothes. She said "I am never going to be that much more comfortable."</p> <p>I laughed. "Don't worry about it." A part of me hated my role-playing. But the other part of me said I could never let her down. Once we returned to the couch, I had to tell her to hold still.</p> <p>Brie was sitting with her legs around my waist. I kissed her on her bare shoulder and caressed her hair. The smell of our mixed juices filled my nostrils.</p> <p>For the first time in this evening, she kissed my lips very tenderly. I was a little worried I might be turning her off, but I was relieved when it was over with. Our lips stayed together until finally it was too late. Her hips were still in control, her hips were grinding my cock and her pussy was aching for release.</p> <p>I had a hard time pushing the table away from the far end of the couch. I lifted Brie by the hips. It felt amazing. I was worried about her moving. I couldn't do that too hard right now. I had to wait until she was ready to have her release. Brie was on her tip toes. If I just let it get better, she wouldn't leave me with her.</p> <p>I was not about to give up for once. The first time she came, it was with such intensity and she looked like she wasn't going to stop. It was an experience all her own. She was still riding me. But her movements became slightly less of a blur, as she was almost in the middle. She was starting to push back. Her head was down, it looked like her hair was in a puddle of sweat. Her breathing stopped, but she didn't withdraw. I began to feel the blood returning to my penis. It was hard to pull it out. Brie was still riding me. But I tried.</p> <p>It was a struggle, as I kept myself on the sidelines. It was hard to hold on. But I kept my mouth over hers. I was still holding Brie. She pulled away and smiled at me. I was proud of her. Her smile made mine glow. She was glowing through the entire evening, and had never been so happy.</p> <p>I looked down at her body. There was no way it was going to stop. I wanted to make love to her the way she had just been made love to. I wanted her to experience the love she now had. My own woman again.</p> <p>Brie's hands reached up and slid down my chest. She rubbed me softly. I wanted to say something, but there was something in her face that told me to say what I wanted to say.</p> <p>"We made love tonight," she whispered to me.</p> <p>"We did," I replied. I began to pull out from her. This was new. I expected her to pull away from me at whatever point. She just kept holding me. I moved her to stand. I held her, until she realized what I was doing. "Let me," she said, and moved her hips right in front of me. I pulled out a little more.</p> <p>I had thought that it was over when she started pushing back. It looked like she would have to slide it back in when I pushed it back in. It felt strange but also exciting. I tried to think of how we could make a better coupling that wayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
