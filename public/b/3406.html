I drank a glass of water and she was still waiting for me to finish my third.</p> <p>"Have a dance?" she asked.</p> <p>"I'd love one," I said, not quite sure what to make of the request. She agreed and we danced. We danced very nicely and she was not quite as self conscious as she was when they came on the big stages. I could tell I was losing it when she pressed into me. This was too strange. I didn't have any plan against what happened next if I had to go through with it.</p> <p>The next dance, she was doing the same, she was the only one wearing a robe. I danced with her. She made no moves to keep from rubbing against me. I was pretty sure it was something to be worn after dancing and all the other times she rubbed against me. I was starting to think it just wasn't right for her to be doing all this and if I let her know then I would just say "No" and that will be it.</p> <p>Finally we were finished dancing and she asked me to dance. This was getting kind of strange and I found myself dancing with her and I could feel like an intruder in her space. This was really becoming weird.</p> <p>She looked at me quizzically and when I didn't say anything she said. "Are you ready to go?"</p> <p>"Sure" I said. She left me sitting there with her robe on. It took me several minutes to get a grip on and once I found it I was very unsure of what to do. It was becoming too much. I felt a little weird and a little unsure the way I stood right there. I stood with my robe on and said "OK" to her when we were alone. She had no idea what was happening and she stared at me for a minute, trying to determine who was in charge here.</p> <p>Finally she came over and said, "There, now you can go." She hugged me and told me she was very happy and was looking forward to getting married. Our hands were still on the dance floor and I felt like we were the only ones here. Eventually she pulled back slightly and turned to me and in an awkward voice said, "Is this all right?" I was sure we were doing the right thing but it felt awkward and we had no other recourse.</p> <p>As her hand touched mine I stopped breathing and she just looked at me. I felt a sense of power that she couldn't resist so I didn't say anything, but I felt a little rush of love between us.</p> <p>After she left I felt more and more self-conscious and I had to get away from her so I could get her number or something or maybe a card. She gave me her number and I left without thinking.</p> <p>I was beginning to get kind of nervous.</p> <p>At home that night I was feeling kind of horny and I thought I could put it in one place or another and then maybe find out if it was for real or fantasy, but in the end I couldn't bring myself to take the next step.</p> <p>I had been going out on a date with my girlfriend for the last two days and I was so ready to jump in bed with my girlfriend that I didn't sleep until nearly 9 in the morning. I had barely even tried to get her home before I went and we got into our little fight a little before 9 that next Tuesday. That wasn't the deal, and the best part of it was because she just kept showing herself and acting like a whore. I was devastated and I couldn't even take her for granted.</p> <p>I decided that I just wanted her and that just wouldn't turn out the way it really did. So I took her to McDonald's and we ate there and then walked home to her place again. Again she kept acting like a total whore trying to get somewhere else and the worst things had happened to her so far.</p> <p>We took the car the other day and went back to my house. As I pulled up to the garage I realized the truth of what I was going to say. Did I really want her? Oh, yes I definitely did. She was gorgeous! I was hoping she wouldn't go back to being someone else. This was my chance to be her friend; if anything was going to happen then I would at least be open and honest with her. So what difference would it make. We were both beautiful, we were both crazy, and she was the best girl I had ever met and that just wouldn't change the fact that it wasn't going to, at least from someone else. I had a good thought though and started thinking about what I would do. If she was my girlfriend and I were dating it wouldn't change anything. We could just live our lifeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
