My tongue was licking her wet and clit as my fingers massaged her dripping hole.</p> <p>Her hips moved and then she stiffened from the force of her orgasm.</p> <p>She moaned, "I need to be fucked. Please fuck me."</p> <p>I lifted myself up and positioned my hard cock at the entrance of her pussy.</p> <p>She moaned, "Take it slowly. I want to feel it.</p> <p>Slowly I slid into her. Her body pushed back as my cock entered. She was so tight, she let go of herself as I entered her again.</p> <p>I began to thrust with long trusts. She was moaning and making little sounds and it made me so good. My body was being fucked by only one person.</p> <p>She looked at me and said, "Please fuck me. Please fuck me."</p> <p>I felt myself coming closer to climax and the thought of her telling me not to cum in her made me crazy.</p> <p>I gave it all we possessed and I could feel my seed shooting into her hot, wet pussy.</p> <p>They kissed again and I looked down and saw my cum oozing out of her swollen pussy and down into the crack of her ass.</p> <p>She said, "Thanks. I am so very close to another orgasm now. You might want to hold your cock out for me as long as you can."</p> <p>I had been in a trance from the moment she pulled her hand away.</p> <p>I started to withdraw from her with a groan as I felt myself start to slip from her.</p> <p>She laughed and said, "That's no way in hell. You can never have that with me. Get into the shower and take your mind from me."</p> <p>I was so overcome with pleasure that I had no choice but to do what she said.</p> <p>I got into the tub and watched as the water cascaded over her. She moved around to wash the cum from her skin and I turned up the water just a little. We talked for a while and then I took and towel off my nakedness and toweled her dry. I wrapped a towel around her and dried her hair as she kissed me.</p> <p>Her hair was dry and soft. Before she knew what happened, she had her hand on my hard cock as we cuddled next to the shower and washed each other.</p> <p>I had to have her body again. I grabbed the shower head from her and turned it on, adjusted the water, and she grabbed the soap and rinsed my cock as she soaped me.</p> <p>She was now cleaning my cock with her mouth and hands. Her body was so sensual and feminine that it moved in a hypnotic way. She was in control of every part of her body and her sex was being fucked. Her breasts were very firm and her stomach was sexy and smooth.</p> <p>She kissed her way down over my cock and slowly, sensually, licked the pre-cum off of my cock as it started to regain it's strength before she continued. This time when she licked up my shaft, I gasped and she looked up at me and said, "My turn."</p> <p>She went right back to my cock and she wrapped her mouth around my dick as I stood there with my eyes closed for a millisecond before she opened her mouth, kissed me and engulfed me.</p> <p>She started to move her head up and down and when I started to cum in her mouth, it made her eyes roll back.</p> <p>We finished washing and dried and then she led me back to the bedroom.</p> <p>She laid down on the bed and asked, "Will you be my lover tonight?"</p> <p>I said, "I don't have to be in charge of your pleasures. You will be the center of my attention and the best fuck. You'll have everything I'm saying."</p> <p>She smiled and said, "You're right. It makes me more aroused to know that I have something special in store."</p> <p>We both laughed then began to kiss again. We caressed each other as my hands trailed down to her shapely legs. I kneaded her ass as we kissed. I was becoming hard again as I watched her body. Her body was beautiful without any clothes. Her breasts were firm and her hips flared in a delightful erotic way. She opened her legs and pulled me down to her.</p> <p>Slowly I was licking her pussy and kissing her as she rubbed her soft breasts in my hair and whispered, "Take me."</p> <p>I lowered myself between her legs and pressed my hard cock against her pussy lips.</p> <p>I could hear her gasp in passion, "Take my virginity first."</p> <p>Her voice was almost a whisper as I whispered back. "Take it slow."</p> <p>As she said those last twoâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
