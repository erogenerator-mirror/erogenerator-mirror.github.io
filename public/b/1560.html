I shouted.</p> <p>"Oh, ok, well, you're right; he's still hard but he's not going to be able to cum on his own."</p> <p>She laughed, then reached down to grab me. "But, I want you to fuck me! Put him in! It'll just be a little while!"</p> <p>"But I want you to do that. I want to feel you stretching and fucking me at the same time!" I begged.</p> <p>"Ok, then. That's cool." She kissed me gently on the lips, then sat upright. She smiled at me then reached behind her and grabbed my hand once more. "Come on, let's go get changed." she said with a wink. "The next store open is a minute later."</p> <p>"Oh, ok," I said, then got up to make my way. I tried to pull my pants up, but found my shoes wouldn't budge. My cock was already starting to swell. I started getting mad as we walked back, not looking at her in the hallway.</p> <p>Just before we entered the change room, I said, "Look at the cock and balls again. That was great."</p> <p>"Thanks," she replied. She didn't say a word as we walked to a corner to where the girls were changing. I noticed that the nipples were standing out a bit more in the white blouse, too. When we entered, the doors on the opposite side were closed, so when I saw the door open it made me think about the next store open for anyone. I turned around to say something to her, but she just said, "I'll meet you downstairs." and walked back around the corner. I was just about to turn around and run up the stairs when she stopped.</p> <p>"No, wait, wait a second," I said. "There's some people out the back. Let's go check them out first."</p> <p>She paused, but didn't turn. She got up and walked out then followed me.</p> <p>We both walked down the three flights until we were in front of the one in which they would be open. We looked at each and then the door, then went to step outside. As we walked toward it, I was just about to call out to her, but then stopped when I saw a young girl, probably around 18ish, come out from the store.</p> <p>"Hey, you okay?" she asked.</p> <p>"No, I'm not okay, but I'm ok." I said.</p> <p>"Oh, so you wanted to see us?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes, I uh, err, erm... yeah."</p> <p>"I saw you on the other side, at the store." she said.</p> <p>I saw her eyes dart down, but continued to take things in.</p> <p>"Sorry. I didn't mean to."</p> <p>"It's alright. Just a little shocked that I saw you but I guess I was really looking for new friends as I always figured a man would."</p> <p>I just nodded my head without saying anything.</p> <p>"So I'm... I'm a little nervous. Do you feel so..."</p> <p>She just walked up closer and put her arms on my knees.</p> <p>"I mean, no, we're great. I, uh, I can help you." I just waited for her to continue.</p> <p>"Yeah, I think that would be nice. And I'm sure we can figure something out." she said and started moving closer. I put my hands on her hips and held her while I spoke.</p> <p>"Hey, why don't you let me see you again for a while?" I asked.</p> <p>She giggled. "Maybe, but only if the girl at the store can help."</p> <p>"Yeah, she can. She works right down here."</p> <p>She smiled. "You mean, she could help you? You know, make you feel better." I laughed.</p> <p>"Yeah," I replied. "And I could make you feel better."</p> <p>She smiled, then looked at me. "Maybe you could just... make me feel good."</p> <p>We both giggled and she reached out and hugged me.</p> <p>After a moment, as the girl returned to getting ready for her shift, I asked what she meant by making a guy feel good.</p> <p>"Make me feel good, I guess." she said, and then turned and stepped towards me. When she reached me, she said, "I'm going to help you make the right choice in life though."</p> <p>"Thanks for the advice." I responded, but it was difficult to think straight.</p> <p>We embraced and started kissing again. The kiss turned more passionate. My body was already tingling as she moved against me.</p> <p>"Oh yeah, you want toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
