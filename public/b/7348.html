I'm married. I don't have a baby. How could you be so mean? It's like, we've made an agreement! You've said I need to be alone. Don't you think I can forgive you?"</p> <p>"It's complicated," she finally whispered.</p> <p>"Look, it's okay. At times I'm in love with you. It's complicated."</p> <p>"What does that have to do with anything?" she asked, struggling to find the words.</p> <p>"Well, let's say something," I explained. "Something happened at work that you didn't like. Or something good happened at work that you don't like. Maybe it's because it came from nowhere? Maybe it's because you're afraid of me?"</p> <p>"Let's say that you just dumped me for someone else. We'd both be out of a job. I'd be on my way home from work. I would just be home from work all day. In any event, you'd have never considered the possibility that I was someone who wouldn't love you. I was just a way to vent my frustration at being dumped. And I did it. I think I'm what a writer looks like now. Who could say no?"</p> <p>"So then, we're in your car, and it starts up. Let's go!"</p> <p>"And, what do we do then?" I asked.</p> <p>"Everything," she smiled. "Just remember, we don't have to play games."</p> <p>"You're too smart for that."</p> <p>"I've also had a couple of boyfriends," she continued. "But, it's not all sex. There's some other level of passion. And, yes, I'm your wife. But, I'm not the same woman that you've fallen in love with."</p> <p>Her smile was very sad, as it was. "Of course I've had this crush on you," I said. "But, let's not forget that."</p> <p>We were in our home for about 30 seconds before she reached down and picked up her panties and stuffed them into her purse. "Sorry, sweetie! There's no way that I'm going to forget you! And no way that I'm going to forget you either." She pulled the panties up again to her nose and tucked them into her purse. With her back turned, she pulled off her tank top and bra. She pulled her jeans and thong off and stood nude before me. I smiled as I pulled out my phone, and handed it to her. "What do you want?" she asked.</p> <p>"Let's just forget the whole thing. It's not like you're cheating now – I mean you'll never cheat on me again. I was very fond of you," I sighed.</p> <p>"I know! I'll never forget you! I love you!" she told me. "Let's just forget what happened when we were out together. I'll never regret this."</p> <p>***</p> <p>We were in a dark corner that no one could see. We were naked. We'd been in a public place, alone with each other, and had a little talk that made me feel like the most desirable woman that ever walked the Earth. She told me that she enjoyed being naked at home but that she got into being a nudist a lot more now than she had before. She enjoyed the freedom of being alone with her surroundings while she was nude. She even enjoyed being nude in a park on Sunday mornings. We didn't talk about sex until the previous evening. When she had to go away, we made love. On our first night at home alone together, she invited me to join her in the bathroom. She said that she always took her shower before going to bed. She wanted to know what else I would like to do to her. Since I didn't have the box, I put it in the corner. She turned on the water and waited. I had seen a variety of naked women in my life. Most of them were very plain and ordinary. Some were voluptuous and voluptuous, some looked like curves, and some had the lines and wrinkles like it was going out of fashion days. It was obvious that I couldn't stand the thought of having to ask her to take down her dress when that wasn't what she wanted.</p> <p>By the third or fourth time that we had our first night there, I was seriously considering telling her I couldn't stop thinking about her. I wondered just how many times I had fantasized about her when I was so horny. I knew she wouldn't want to do anything, including having sex together, so I put it out of my mind. After her shower she made me stand with her in the shower, while we washed each other up. If I hadn't gotten aroused by the idea of her being naked in the shower, I probably would have thought she was an exhibition—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
