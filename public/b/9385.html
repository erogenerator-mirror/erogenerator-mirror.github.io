"I don't know how to describe it," I added.</p> <p>"You don't know anything?"</p> <p>"I got to college just like you. I didn't think of it as a career. I just kind of started my education," I said. "And I'm glad..."</p> <p>"You're not just glad," she said. "I'll just sit here and watch you for a bit then I'll go and talk to Daddy."</p> <p>She had me sit on the couch. I was still stunned how she looked. I stared at her as she bent down to look at my computer. She smiled to me.</p> <p>"Is there anything else I can help you with?" I asked curiously.</p> <p>"Let me use her, will you?" she asked.</p> <p>"Sure, sure," I said as I stood up. "I'll be right back," I yelled to go get my laptop, as I walked into the den. I watched the screen as I logged in.</p> <p>"Hi, I'm Mom, how can I help you?" she asked.</p> <p>"Oh, right, uh, I'll just turn on my phone," I said with the same bewildered tone of voice. I stared at the screen as I turned off my phone.</p> <p>"Why are you staring at that window?"</p> <p>"Oh, you can't," I said. "It's my father. I'm just looking at his things sometimes." I sat across from her on the couch.</p> <p>"What are you doing," I asked, trying to ignore her.</p> <p>"I just want you to look at things because you'll see what I want you to look at, that's all," she said.</p> <p>Just then, she turned her back to me, and I saw her reach down and touch down on the couch.</p> <p>"Please don't," she said, before looking over her shoulder at me and biting her lip.</p> <p>I didn't know what to say, as it seemed as though things would never be the same. I still sat staring at the screen, I'm sorry, I think, I'm just not used to seeing my father just being someone's mother. I know, he wasn't much of an entertainer, and his work at the shop wasn't a lot of what I wanted in a lover, but I just didn't think I'd like it. Still, we stared at each other as we stared at her computer.</p> <p>"I'll get the mouse," I said, as I reached down and opened the screen.</p> <p>When I got it, I had nothing. I didn't even think about it. I stared for a moment, and then turned and walked back to the couch. I sat it on the floor and put some space between us.</p> <p>"It's okay, Mom," I said. "I still enjoy looking at them, and I'm sure he won't mind if I do this anytime I want you to," I added.</p> <p>"It's okay with me," she said as she leaned against her door. "But, is there something else you want to do?"</p> <p>"Nope, nothing right?" I asked.</p> <p>"No, I'm not. It's just that my father really gets off on watching me."</p> <p>"But, he's my father, your father." It made me feel guilty about what I just said, and in my mind, I realized it made me want to take things further.</p> <p>She looked up at me as she said that, obviously feeling uncomfortable about talking as I stared at her computer.</p> <p>"He doesn't like me looking at them?" she asked.</p> <p>"He doesn't like you looking at stuff that doesn't have anything to do with you," I said.</p> <p>"And how can he be jealous of me looking at the same computer as he is and wondering what it's going to look like when I get home?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don't think he likes that very much," I said.</p> <p>"Come on," she said. "The only thing he's going to understand is why I haven't told him, and why your father would want to watch me like I'm with him."</p> <p>"I'm sure he wouldn't appreciate us watching him," I said. "But he doesn't seem at all happy when his father is sitting right there staring at you," I added.</p> <p>"How does he know that I'm getting a look at a computer when I haven't done anything?" she asked.</p> <p>When it came to her father, I wanted to know what made her jealous, and I wanted to know more about how the man her son was really raised and how it made her happy to see her own fatherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
