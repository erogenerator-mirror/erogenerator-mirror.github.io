She kept her eyes lowered as if she was ashamed to see me with my naked body in front of her. Our lips met. Her lips pressed mine. Her tongue pressed against mine. We began kissing. Our lips pressed against each other, we pulled back. Her lips, on my chin and my chin and my eyes. Her hands slid up to my face and she stroked, caressed, and pulled at my cheek as we slowly moved closer. My body was hot by the minute, the smell of sweat, perfume and arousal was strong in the air.</p> <p>The kisses got hotter and more urgent. Her lips caressed mine with fervor. Both of our bodies were on fire.</p> <p>I felt her hand caress the side of my face. The palm lightly brushed my cheek. She traced her fingertips down my chin then down to my lips. Her fingers pressed against my lips. I sucked at her fingers, my own fingers sucking hers from her hand. Her hand slid lower over the side of my face and brushed against my cheek.</p> <p>At first she touched my cheek and licked her lips. Then down my chin. Her tongue pressed against my lips and I drew it into my mouth. The taste was intoxicating. Her eyes were on fire. My mouth parted.</p> <p>The kiss deepened. Our tongues met. It was not a sexual kiss as I'd expected. It was not a kiss of convenience as we'd all expected. This was pure passion. I felt her hand under the water again, then she began caressing my breasts. I tilted my back, pressing my tits into her hands as she rubbed the surface of my breasts from the base to the nipple, then to the left and back again and then the right.</p> <p>I pressed my breast to his hand. It brushed my nipple. I was sure he heard me moan.</p> <p>I ran my fingers down the curve of his neck, down to the indentation of his collar bone, across the ridge just beneath the collar bone and then back up his neck, over the hollow over the spot below. He was hard. It was obvious he was aroused. I had a feeling that we'd both be aroused. She was horny too.</p> <p>I lifted my head so my chin rested on my cheek next to his, and kissed his lips. The kiss continued with their mutual passion. I closed my eyes, savoring the contact and kissing so I could get a better focus on what the kiss was. His cock throbbed with every motion of her hand on it.</p> <p>When her hand slid down to his cock, she pressed her lips against my ear. She kissed it lightly, then moved to the other ear. She slid her tongue into it, tickled his ear lobe with her lips. I gasped lightly. Her kiss then went back up my nose and I gasped again, "Ohhhh," and repeated it a little louder. We kissed again.</p> <p>I was about to say, "No," but my lips would not allow it, and she put that out of my mind until I was still, breathing hard. I took his cock in my hand. I stroked it gently, rolling the head between my fingers as she ran the back of her hand up and down it. She kept that up until our kiss ended. She kissed again, then looked into his eyes the whole time and said, "We can do it here, if you want."</p> <p>"I want to do it here," he said softly. Then he looked back at me with his eyes. "You have to help me out there."</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"We can, you know," he said motioning to the water. "The shower here."</p> <p>Without thinking, I got up out of the water, and walked over and the back of my tub. I slid the door open to the end of the shower room to the left of the entrance. Then I turned to give him an eye. He looked at me with interest as my back was to him. I bent over, reached down to my cunt and, after a few seconds, rubbed my fingers over my clitoris, then dipped a thick finger into it, pushing it back again to get more lubrication, again, and again. The wetness coated my hand quickly. I slid my finger out from my lips. I looked back at him as I slid a second finger, slippery with my wetness, inside myself, and began working it in and out of my cunt, working it in with my thumb. He was watching. I looked back at him, still on my knees, leaning back against the faucet, my elbows on the faucet; my back straight, legs bent at the knees with her feet about an inch off the tile, and one foot at an angle, bent at the hip, her pussy open and wet, her legs spread, knees wide apart.</p> <p>Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
