I can tell."</p> <p>"What is it?"</p> <p>"I'm a virgin."</p> <p>"Virgin? What does that mean?"</p> <p>There was a moment when he didn't say anything and she heard a small gasp escape from her mouth.</p> <p>"Oh my God, I'm actually doing it!"</p> <p>Just what I need, I thought to myself. I'm not fucking anyone. So I said out loud.</p> <p>"Oh yeah, I can even make out a little better with an electric dildo than a toy."</p> <p>"That is so cool! Are you serious, I'm not a virgin?"</p> <p>"I'm not sure but I have always thought you were one. It is amazing to be with someone whose virginity we can use to our carnal desires."</p> <p>"Would it actually work that way?"</p> <p>"No, just trust me. If it's true, it is amazing and I know the real deal." There was a little hesitation but soon, they were both taking turns on their clits for the first time. It was wonderful to know that they had each other so close, yet alone. That made me cum and she had a similar experience.</p> <p>They both collapsed next to each other on the bed and, still fully clothed, I felt myself grow to full length when she moved close to me and whispered in my ear.</p> <p>"We haven't done this before. If you hadn't been so timid, I'd be able to talk you into taking me in the sack."</p> <p>I smiled and nodded as she started to take off her clothes.</p> <p>"But first, I have a surprise," she said as she climbed on the bed and slid her body up over mine. He eyes, his face as close as she could get them, were filled with worry. I felt her tongue trace the outline of my lips and she slowly kissed me and opened her eyes.</p> <p>"I thought it would be nice to have an experiment" she said with a devilish little grin, but I thought it was more of what she had to say next.</p> <p>"You wouldn't just 'do this with me,' would you?"</p> <p>"Of course not. If we're going to do this, it's just going to be different."</p> <p>"Different where I'll have sex with you?"</p> <p>"Just like that will be different from fucking"</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I asked</p> <p>"Positive."</p> <p>"Okay," and, I think, "Okay, I'm going to see whether and when you can be with me without breaking any rules."</p> <p>"I don't think we had that much to work with."</p> <p>"I don't think we have been tested since the last time I tried. What can I do for you?"</p> <p>"I've been wondering about this all day long."</p> <p>"Well, you can ask at anytime I feel ready to try. I'll never tell. I just hope you have a good experience in a number of ways." Then, she paused, looked directly into my eyes and asked, "What's your favorite way to be with a woman?"</p> <p>I couldn't help but laugh a little. She wasn't going to have the words to describe how I felt about her.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"I think we have a lot in common."</p> <p>"Okay, I guess so," I said, and then, "What're you looking for before I show you where we can get it?"</p> <p>"That depends." She leaned over and kissed me softly on the lips.</p> <p>"It does, but we can always use a condom."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"I want to make up for my inexperience today."</p> <p>"You're a virgin?" I asked surprised.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Don't worry, we will still be friends, but I know we can play out our fantasies and keep each other healthy."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"I'm not going to lie to you. I've known you for more than four years and, as a matter of fact, I don't regret one word of it."</p> <p>"I think we're going to have to make do with practice."</p> <p>"Practice? You are kidding."</p> <p>"No, we are practicing practicing with each other, so no bullshit, okay?"</p> <p>"You don't have to be my boyfriend."</p> <p>"Of course, but I've been asking for you to be my boyfriend in the past too."</p> <p>"We can do whatever you want in practice, but why are we stopping?" sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
