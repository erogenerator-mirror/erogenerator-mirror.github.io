It felt like my hands were being squeezed as I moved. The whole time I was listening, her words, the words of my own words, were being shared. She told me to go to my room, which was on the other end of the gym. She sat on her bed, which was on a small side table. She pulled the sheet down. I looked at the picture of a naked woman. I looked at her tits, which were just covered in her sweat.</p> <p>I started to ask her what she wanted. It felt like my mouth could only move the smallest inch and not break my throat. I just looked at the image. When she smiled at me and said she had thought of that too, I was so enthralled by her. She asked if I would be her 'first lover,' I just smiled and she grabbed the packet of condoms I had been taking.</p> <p>She laid back on her bed. As the picture of the naked woman, I looked around. I got nervous. What was she going to think of me. I looked closer. She was naked and she had her back turned to me. My hand went to my cock and I started to rub and stroke it. I kept in time with her comments and comments. Her pussy lips kept disappearing a couple times. She was really turned on and she lifted her leg, showing me something inside the fabric. It was shaved, I can get it for her. I kept on looking. I couldn't really stop myself. I moved her legs apart.</p> <p>I moved closer. She turned to me and kissed me. For the first time, she said, 'please take me. Take me.'</p> <p>My heart raced, I felt like I was going to cum. I tried to say something, I didn't say anything. I was surprised at how turned on I was. In some odd way I had felt this way with another man before. Then I saw it, for the first time. This was the start. After another hour I could last for hours. It was like the tension had been released. She turned on her side and placed her head on my chest. I was lying on top of her with my back over her. We lay there for ages. My mind was on her, then on that one picture. We talked, then she said, "I can tell you really mean it," again in a quiet way.</p> <p>"Me too."</p> <p>She was quiet again. I looked at the wall as I lay by her. Her arms were around me, holding me tightly. We looked at each other. It was strange to see her like that. She kept on looking at picture of her naked and I just stared at her like a deer caught in the headlights. She was staring at me. It was exciting.</p> <p>I kept rubbing her thigh. As she kept looking at her own picture, my hand traveled over her stomach and I cupped her mound. To my amazement I got a soft kiss on the lips. I looked at her. She had that smile again. I smiled back and moved closer to her. She still had her eyes closed. I got off the bed and knelt next to her. The light was too good to see her expression. I looked at her face, and the expression it showed. My eyes were still locked, but I lifted my hand to her face. She didn't respond. I lowered my head and kissed the lips before moving my mouth to the other's. We kissed that time for some time.</p> <p>We didn't move. We kept making out. I think we were both enjoying it, but neither of us wanted to stop. We were enjoying each other. Eventually I reached down between her legs. Slowly I touched her. I moved very slowly and her leg spread wide, then it parted. I looked at her face again, she gave me a look of anticipation. The fingers of her left hand were going up and down her slit. My first thoughts about having sex with her was something I never really wanted, but it seemed to be so right. I looked at her face while I touched her.</p> <p>When I touched her face, she was biting her bottom lip. I held her lips firmly and her eyes looked back at me. A small smile crossed her face. I looked her in the eyes again. I knew what was going to happen, and I wanted it to happen. She looked at me, and I saw her face tense, a small smile.</p> <p>"Come on," I said.</p> <p>Again she gave me a nervous smile, then got up on her knees and pushed her hand into the back of my shorts. I lifted her legs to my chest. I looked at my hand as it moved up her thigh. She was so wet. I touched her. I touched the inside of her cheek and then the back of her head. She closed her eyes, turned her head so the kiss was less than an hour from nowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
