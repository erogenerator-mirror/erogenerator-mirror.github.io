Did you like my answer?" I whispered to him.</p> <p>"You can be absolutely truthful with me," he purred into my neck.</p> <p>"You're really not so sure about the things you're going to ask me, are you?"</p> <p>"No. And I've already asked you."</p> <p>"I hope you're right." He whispered back.</p> <p>"Well?"</p> <p>"If I were so sure."</p> <p>*****</p> <p>He leaned up against the bathroom counter, his hand stroking my face gently. I turned my head as I could, looking up into his blue eyes. "So, how did this work- did you figure out how to get me to talk to you about something important?"</p> <p>"Of course. Did you think I'd listen to you in the heat of the moment?"</p> <p>"Nope." I nodded as I leaned forward and brought my mouth to his. His lips were smooth and warm, and I took in a deep breath as he kissed me with all his senses. His lips were soft and full, and I savored the taste of him. My hands moved down along his back, and he groaned when I moved them up to unbutton his jeans. The zipper was quickly pulled down, and he lifted his hips to encourage me to go as he pulled his jeans and underwear all the way down slowly. I smiled around his mouth as I saw the head of his cock emerge from it's semi-erection with a slithering and sway. I ran my open hand over his shaft as I pulled him closer with it's growing length.</p> <p>I moved onto the bathroom counter with him, and he wrapped his arm around me. I lay my hand along his waist and reached down between us, his cock jutting against my hip. He pushed his hips back to meet mine, and his hands slid up my thigh until they were on my hips, gripping them firmly. His lips brushed from my eyelids, down along the top of my cheek, and then up between my lips and chin. I leaned in to kiss him with an open mouth, and he leaned forward to kiss me with as much passion that he may have had earlier in the morning, to me in the flesh. I felt his breath against my lips, and his hands slid down from my waist to my breasts again. Then lower, but without a second's hesitation, to cup them.</p> <p>My fingers were instantly wet with the evidence of his passion, and my breasts felt warm and full as I continued to hold on to the counter. The hand that was gripping my breasts slid up to cup one, then the other, and I moaned with pleasure as his fingers slid around to caress my clit. He gently squeezed and stroked the fullness of my breasts together with his hand, then brought one breast up to his mouth and suckled the nipple between his lips. My back arched in pleasure, and he slid one hand to the back of my head, pulling my hair and pulling me to him. His hands slid down and over my hips to cup the curve of my ass.</p> <p>"Are you sure about this?" he whispered hotly in my ear as he leaned back against the bathroom counter.</p> <p>"Yes," I whispered back, "I'm so sure." I reached out to wrap my arms around his neck again. He pulled back enough to look down at me, and smiled as I reached for his cock. "Do you think I can do this for you?"</p> <p>"Please don't hold back. Don't hold back." He said with a cheeky smile as he reached for my hand. "I've been begging you to for months."</p> <p>"Oh, please!" I whispered hotly, taking his hand and putting it on the head of his cock. "Let's do this!"</p> <p>He slid his hand down to my stomach and back up, but when he looked up at my eyes and smiled he slid it back up. "I can tell you want this, now that I'm with you." And with that his hand slid back down to my pussy, pulling my lips apart as I spread myself wider for him. His fingers slid inside first, and his whole body shivered as if he'd been hit with a dozen nails. "Is this what you want- can I fuck you?" he asked with those eyes looking up at me as if a puppy waiting for a spotter. "Yes," I replied softly.</p> <p>"How?"</p> <p>"Just do it- just put your cock in- just do it!"</p> <p>"But you've seen it a million times," he said as he grabbed my hips harder.
