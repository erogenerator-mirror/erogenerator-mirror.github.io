My own personal porno had become an art form and I loved it. Now, it was a work of art as was the pleasure I was getting from masturbating, at least in my very real experience. This was different, I admitted to myself, from the real world. A real woman.</p> <p>I could feel my orgasm approach as I listened to my wife's erotic cries and the sounds of passion on my sex. My climax began to build and before I was certain that I'd cum, I saw stars. My entire body was tingling with excitement, the energy of my orgasm, and the erotic feelings of release.</p> <p>When I opened my eyes to try to focus on my own surroundings, I saw that my wife was still kneeling between my legs sucking my very sensitive organ. Her head rose and fell back, taking deep breath, the muscles of her mouth milking my shaft. A thick stream of my cum shot into her mouth, hitting her cheeks, nose, and chin. In the darkness, I could see that she seemed to swallow my cum, and her fingers continued to work me into ecstasy. I could still hear her sexy giggle, but only heard her soft moans.</p> <p>After my climax ended, my wife stood up and moved forward. My hand returned to her breast, now covered with the cream which had been given to me. I could immediately feel her hard nipples, hard against my palm. Her breasts were beautiful and she caressed them with her fingers, and then moved them up to my face, kissing me deeply. I was overcome with emotion and my dick started to harden again, as I felt another woman's breast pressing against my lips on mine. I moved my hands to her waist and caressed her, moving myself up and down as deeply as she allowed me. She had such a sexy body for such a young girl, and I had no doubt that I would have had a similar experience with her, even if our circumstances hadn't been similar to this.</p> <p>I heard her kissing her way to my ear, and knew she was trying to lead me to some place I couldn't return home. She was pushing me to my back and straddled my chest, my engorged member pressed up by her thighs, and her breast dangling down, touching my ribs.</p> <p>She smiled up at me and held my face between her hands as she lowered herself gently onto me. She had a look in her eyes that was unreadable, and I had the sensation of being inside her. She had just sat on me, my organ still inside of her as she sat on me, and she was very gentle and loving. She held my eyes in hers as she began to sit down fully, and I felt myself slide up into her. She closed her eyes and leaned back, and I could feel the soft lips of her pussy on the side of my dick, still buried to the hilt within her tight channel.</p> <p>I was very content to stay here forever, and enjoyed the experience without wanting to move. But at the same time, I knew that I must return to the room to clean up the evidence of the way this had happened to me. And so I had to clean myself off. My body had never really been a part of sex like this with my wife, and it certainly wasn't any part of being my wife.</p> <p>I leaned back and let her slide up my body, and she leaned down and kissed me on the lips. Her hand slid over to my penis, and she began to stroke it up and down, taking me in and out from the base to the tip, back and forth, as her tongue played in my mouth. I could hear her breathing, but couldn't tell if that was what she was doing with her hands because she had lowered herself, or if it was her doing this to me with another girl. I just hoped that the latter was true.</p> <p>We were lying on her bed, and both of us were sweating, but I couldn't say anything. I couldn't get over how good she felt, or the fact that we were both nude, and she had never been the dominant partner before.</p> <p>But she was insistent, and I didn't have long to dwell on that. I began to thrust up into her, taking her entire weight on me in one thrust. I was surprised how hard she was at her initial penetration, but her response got harder and deeper, and then she began to bounce up and down on top of me with wild abandon. As I kept pushing and thrusting in her, I felt her juices again, and knew that she had also had another climax, as her movements became frantic.</p> <p>I knew that I had to find out what she liked, and just fucked her like a woman, just like she had wanted from the start.</p> <p>She was moaning in between her moansâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
