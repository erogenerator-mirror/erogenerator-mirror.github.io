I had him lie down on his back in the middle of the bed. I straddled his groin, rubbing my now dripping pussy right up against his face.</p> <p>"God. You have no idea how much I've wanted your cock for years."</p> <p>"Well, you had no idea," he muttered as he lifted my dress upward, and pulled it up over my head and then threw it around me. I was naked except for the lacy white bra, panties and high heels. I took his face in my hands, and kissed him again.</p> <p>"Come on, lover . . ." I started unbuttoning his shirt while he had his hands all over me. While he peeled my bra away from my body, I stood and removed his shirt and tossed it away.</p> <p>My pussy was wet and glistening from the anticipation of what I just described. As I had said, I just hadn't gotten a chance to do much preparation with him that first time. I knelt down on the floor in front of him, and leaned back to watch his body through my full lids. I looked like an angel of sorts, or at least I hoped I looked that way. I leaned even closer, and could smell his strong muskiness, his body odor, and finally, and much to my consternation, his cock.</p> <p>"Mmmmmm, you smell so good when you come. I could eat you forever."</p> <p>"You are such a stud . . ." I said, still leaning forward, and taking him in hand. "You don't know how much I've wanted this . . ." I said as I reached my head forward and sucked him for a few seconds before moving back up to his chest and kissing his lips, then he did the same for me. "We're going to get you naked now," I said, pulling down his briefs and freeing his gorgeous dick. It stood just under seven inches long, and about as thick as one of my fingers.</p> <p>"Oh God. Not now. I've been waiting a long time for this."</p> <p>I knelt down, and kissed the tip before leaning forward and engulfing his balls in my mouth one more time. I was surprised how much I had been enjoying the experience. All at once, I felt Mike pull me back toward him, and had a hard cock in my pussy in less than two minutes. I lay down as Mike had done last night, and had only just started him inside me as he entered again. I was surprised that he didn't tense up, as if he didn't want to hurt me as he began a hard thrusting rhythm of his own, and it was only after I had come that I even looked to be able to keep from coming all over Mike's face. I have always enjoyed watching my boyfriend suck cock after sex, but I had no objection to his cock licking me to orgasm. As much as I loved watching him with my boyfriend as we had sex, I had never come as hard and as many times as I had just the night before. But having someone else fuck me again, especially someone else's cock sucking skills, felt like heaven, and it was all I could do to hold back my orgasm and prolong the feeling of his lips and tongue on my pussy-juice saturated skin. Mike pulled me up and I sat on his face while Mike's tongue drove me higher and higher. I lost my breath. I felt my face flush, and my eyes begin to water. I think I passed out.</p> <p>I collapsed onto Mike's chest.</p> <p>"You're amazing," I said, and he kissed me while I wrapped my arms around him. His cock was still rock hard inside me, and began pulsing as he moved up on the bed, and lay on his back, and pulled me along with him. I wrapped my legs around his hips, and he began to move me up and down on his cock.</p> <p>"Oh, god, I want this so good," I heard myself say as my climax began. He held me even tighter and began to fuck me. My orgasm began to build as I felt Mike's balls slap against mine and the slap of our bodies on the bed. It was something I had been fantasizing about, but never expected, and here was this cock, this man's huge dick, pounding in and out of my pussy. I lost all control and yelled out his name. We both were bucking as he fucked me, and I rode him as hard as I could. I think I had climaxed once before, but that was more because of the strength of his powerful thrusts and the force of his cock. For the very first time, I found a real orgasm, and I felt Mike's sperm explode up into me, and as I continued to ride himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
