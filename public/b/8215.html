Take me. Take me in your mouth and suck me. Suck me. Make me crazy." He kissed his way down my throat, across my sternum. Kissing its pearly peak. Nibbling on my ear. "Yes!"</p> <p>I had a moment's hesitation, and took his cock out of my mouth. The blood throbbing from the veins had made it so hot and wet it felt like it would explode. I looked at his expression, as I watched the pink skin of his cock jacking up and down, a string of sticky semen dripping from its tip, into his eyes. I turned to him, and took his dick in my hand. "Come on, baby. Take me in your mouth. Taste me."</p> <p>It was an erotic sensation. My pussy tingled. I closed my eyes, not wanting to think anything else, but still unable to resist his demand. He leaned down to taste me as I took him in my mouth. So sweet! I felt my panties being pushed down and his hands slipping under my skirt as his warm mouth found its target again. He sucked in the whole of my cock, his throat squeezing my cock. I was getting more and more intense.</p> <p>I could feel that I was going to lose control. He knew what he was doing, as he began to lick and kiss its length from top to bottom, licking all of the tiny slit at the top of it off, and down again...</p> <p>I was going to cum so hard. I was trying to push the chair back against the bed, not wanting him to stop, not wanting him to stop.</p> <p>But he didn't. He was enjoying it as much as I was, and he couldn't hold back. He pulled his mouth away from me, his eyes glazed with my slick, wet cock. "Oh! Baby, I'm sorry I...I...you...I couldn't hold back, you were so beautiful." Without even thinking or knowing what else to do, I let him do what he wanted.</p> <p>He pulled his face away from my cock, stood up and lifted me up. "Crawl to the window." He pulled me into the bedroom closet. Lifting me gently, he pulled my face to his. He pushed himself inside of me, then back out, again and again. "That's it, baby, take it all." he said, looking me right in the eyes. "You want it all..." He thrust himself into me deep, as if he knew I wouldn't stop him.</p> <p>"Mmm." I said, as if there was something in his comment, but he never took his eyes off mine, or at once.</p> <p>After a while, he pulled out of me, then back in. His cock looked bigger. My pussy ached. I wanted more, but was too embarrassed to ask. I just got off his dick, and looked up at him. "Fuck me, Todd. Please. Please fuck me. Fuck me hard and deep, you have to be there. I need your cum..." He pulled out again. I could feel how deep he was and how hard he was throbbing, and I wanted it. "Please," I begged. "I need it!"</p> <p>"Just for that," he said with a little smile, as he stood up. He bent over, holding his dick towards me, letting my panties drop to the floor. After stepping out of them, he rubbed the head of myself against me. The head made me so wet. He was so thick I thought it would hurt me. I felt myself open and open. "Come on," he said, and pushed himself inside me with his cock. "You want it, baby. Come with me. Come with me. " When he pushed himself in again, my first orgasm, lasted for maybe 20 seconds, followed by a second, third then a fourth and an even one on the fifth.</p> <p>He pulled himself out. My legs were weak. I could hear myself whimpering. He grabbed a blanket and put it under my ass, leaving a good amount of the leg area exposed to him. "I still think we should take this upstairs," he said. He pulled me to the bed.</p> <p>Taking off his pants, I took his cock in my hand again. My own cock throbbed with the excitement. "Baby, I love you and I want you to be with me more every day."</p> <p>I took him in his hand and laid him over the end of the bed, with a pillow and pillow on top of him. I crawled between his legs, pushing them up to my shoulders. I kissed the spot between his neck and shoulder where he could feel my lips touching his.
