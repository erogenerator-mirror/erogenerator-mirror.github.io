The sensations were like nothing I had ever felt before from anything I had ever had in my life and I tried to hold my body still as the sensations were building. When I felt myself building and rising I began to moan softly and I didn't hear the door open. For the first time in my life I realized that we were in the open air for all of us to see. When the sensation intensified and I moaned quietly and pressed myself against him so that I could feel the hardness between his legs on my belly. "That's it ... that's it ... right there" I thought to myself. As I felt the first swell of his orgasm and I squeezed him tightly to me as I climaxed around his shaft I let go and felt my knees go weak. I could see the smiles on everybody's face and I felt I wasn't going to be able to do much more but I knew that it was time. He gave one last thrust of his hips and I heard the sound of it and then I felt him go limp. Our bodies were still and we could still smell each other now. He pulled my hips tight to him and we lay there for a while. My lips were still swollen, moist and my body was on fire. That was the first time a cock had ever been in my pussy. I thought to myself that I had always been sexually adventurous. I had always enjoyed sex but had never allowed anyone to touch me there. I think it was the first time I ever had someone's sperm in my pussy.</p> <p>I felt his body relax and I wrapped my arms around him and started to slip from his body but he held me tighter to him. "I've got it, don't you worry about it. It will do more for you than it will for me." I held him to me. Our bodies were still, I felt myself trembling a little as he held me against him. I had never felt or felt passion like I felt tonight. It was like a warm feeling inside of me and I could not move.</p> <p>He held me for a long time and I was overwhelmed by the feeling of closeness. I knew that he was still hard again and that he had come again, and he started to move. I pushed my hips away from him. "I thought that you could take all this now." I said between breaths. I moved down his body till I was lying beside him. I pulled at the sheets. "This is what love is. Don't you think?" I said. I got up off the bed and got on the floor. That way there was a clear view of the whole suite, especially the bed. I leaned over and took him between my lips. It had been several years since I had been able to give a man an orgasm. We made love again as soon as we got back to the hotel and it continued for the rest of our livesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
