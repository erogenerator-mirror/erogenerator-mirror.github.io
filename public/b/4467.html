She kissed me hard on the lips. "I'll talk to him."</p> <p>We walked out together, both knowing the other's intentions. We walked back to her place, holding hands. "This is so great." I said. I felt bad for leaving.</p> <p>Tami's smile returned. "I know," she said.</p> <p>*</p> <p>It's been a few weeks since the two of us met for dinner. She's been looking at some of my new photos. I'm starting to get it from her perspective, too. She is such a little lady. I guess I'm lucky, too.</p> <p>I was lying back in my chair when she approached. Tami was dressed in a t-shirt and jeans. She looked like the cutest thing on the face of the earth. She was wearing high-heeled shoes. "So how is it going, Mom?"</p> <p>I sighed. "He asked me for his advice and I was really going to say no."</p> <p>"I know you have to come and stay for a bit. Do you have a car?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I have one that's just around the corner by the campus."</p> <p>Tami gave me a look. "Are you going to let him take you?"</p> <p>"Oh, no! I'm fine with that. But how long is he going to take you?"</p> <p>"I wouldn't call him a photographer if he's not busy. He's a friend of ours."</p> <p>"Oh really, what kind of friend is he?"</p> <p>"A friend who's going to make sure you know what's going on while you're away. The kind of friend that makes you feel good." She reached down and ran a hand through the black hair that framed her face. "Look at my baby. I can't help it when you have this kind of effect on me."</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"Well, don't you like having your mother in your life?"</p> <p>"Why would I do that?"</p> <p>"She's not going to like you being here with her."</p> <p>"Mom, I don't know what you're talking about!"</p> <p>"Let me guess," she replied. "You like the way she looks when she goes to the store."</p> <p>"I don't want to. I don't like that she wears that dress either, either."</p> <p>Tami laughed. "You're such a dork."</p> <p>"Just joking."</p> <p>"Why? Are you afraid your mother is going to notice?"</p> <p>Again, I shrugged. "Well, no," I said, "she's not. But it just kind of popped into my mind that maybe that's why she'd never even asked me to marry her."</p> <p>"Well, if she's going to be with me, where is it going to go?"</p> <p>"I don't know. You're her own mother. It's pretty tough living with that much at home."</p> <p>"Thanks, Mom, it's probably better than staying away from you all these years."</p> <p>Mom hugged me, then took my hand in hers. "I hope you're okay with this."</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess it's okay," I said. I wasn't sure what else to say. I was feeling kind of overwhelmed. But I was also getting a little better at keeping my voice steady to not embarrass her. And the feeling of being her son wasn't going to hurt her too much for her to be upset. I mean, I did have feelings for her, but I hadn't gotten over them a lot in the past few weeks.</p> <p>Tami's eyes were big as saucers. She took my hand and pressed it into the space between her breasts. "Do you want one of us to get us some more wine for dinner?"</p> <p>"I'd love some more wine."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>Mom's voice broke in mid stroke and she looked at the clock. It would only be a matter of a minute before we could walk our way to the door.</p> <p>When Tami knocked, she opened the door and we made it to the sofa. She was still on her back on the couch, with one leg dangling over the edge. Tami looked over and I gave her a smile and pointed to my shorts. She laughed, then rolled over so that she was next to me on the sofa. She reached over and patted the cushion beside her and she ran her hand over my stomach. Her hand went lower and her fingers ran up and down my inner thigh. "You're a very beautiful young man," she said, "I'd love to watch youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
