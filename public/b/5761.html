"This...this doesn't feel as good as our sex."</p> <p>A slight frown came across my face as it sank in. Was she coming to think of it as making it all worse?</p> <p>"I don't want to just..."</p> <p>"Me either," she snapped. "I've wanted to do this for a long time, just you wait for a little while. We'll get you all warmed up again."</p> <p>I was almost to the side of the bed when she pushed me back on the bed, and moved to straddle me. We didn't have to wait long.</p> <p>My wife straddled my stomach, and my cock went hard between her legs as I felt her lips meet mine and wrap themselves around me. She held the position with her hands as I pushed up into her. It was an incredibly erotic feeling as she worked herself up me.</p> <p>Just as I felt my own orgasm building in me, Beth said, "I think I like that better."</p> <p>We lay like that for a long time, just the two of us. When we finished, Beth rolled off of me, and was instantly aroused. She rolled over on top of me, and kissed me again, passionately and slowly. She broke the kiss for a second or two, and just looked into my eyes.</p> <p>"I don't want to think this gets better," she said with a smile. "Maybe I'm not as good as I thought."</p> <p>"Are you sure? After all...I like you, don't I? You're not...you're not just some guy."</p> <p>"That was nice of you to say that. Now let's have some fun."</p> <p>She lifted herself up so that I could pull my trunks the rest of the way off. As my cock sprang free of them and into the air, it slapped against Beth's thigh with a splatter. She smiled at that and lowered herself to her knees without even having taken the time before to put her hands on me to hold me in place.</p> <p>"I...this feels, nice," she said, as she licked the head of my cock.</p> <p>I watched as her eyes slid down to my balls and watched as my cock swung back up and down between her breasts and down to her chin.</p> <p>I wasn't going to waste this. I grabbed Beth by the head by the hair and pulled her lips down to my cock. I moved her head down to the base of my cock so that she felt full, and she licked me with the head of my cock all along her tongue before I finally shoved it into her mouth.</p> <p>"Ohhhh!" she murmured. "That's nice...oh, I want some of this!"</p> <p>I had to pause a moment before I plunged it into her mouth again. "You better not bite," I said, trying to sound unconcerned. "I'm very sensitive there."</p> <p>I wanted her to enjoy this. I liked to watch someone else, and Beth was a very responsive member. I also enjoyed the feel of her hands as they caressed my balls and thighs and my cock in a sensuous manner as it slid in and out of her mouth. Finally, I pulled her up to her feet, and then sat her down on the bed. I leaned forward and kissed her again.</p> <p>I took both hands in mine, holding her at arm's length as I kissed her passionately. I brought one hand down to her body. I lifted her tank top up, exposing her right breast, and began to rub it, moving over her nipple. I bent over and took her nipple in my mouth while she put her hand around the back of my head.</p> <p>I released her nipple from my mouth as she took the initiative of pushing herself up to me. I got in position to kiss her a while longer before positioning myself back on the floor. She positioned herself over me, looking down at me, as if asking if I had been good. I smiled and nodded my head.</p> <p>She reached down and took hold of my cock as I lay her down, spreading her legs for herself as I knelt between them. I had never seen anything more exciting in my life. Her hair-dappled skin against my skin seemed to beckon me to move in closer.</p> <p>My erection jutted up and down between her legs, and for a moment it felt impossibly good to be within her. I leaned forward and she leaned back as I took her in earnest. She felt warm and soft, and as I pressed my cock, my head popped inside her.</p> <p>"Oh!" she sighed, when I started to pull back. "That's a new feeling."</p> <p>"Yeah," I agreed, "almost like a surpriseâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
