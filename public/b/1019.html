She felt her whole body react to the new force surging inside her. The power inside her just drove her toward a massive orgasm and she had to control the need of doing the job...the job she'd been trained to complete.</p> <p>The pressure inside of her reached new levels and the desire to be fucked increased. It was more than she could handle, but the new energy in her mind was enough to push her to another level as this energy surged inside of her body. Jenna looked into space and the feeling of energy was stronger then anything she'd ever felt before and the energy inside of her felt like it could take her into a whole new dimension of pleasure.</p> <p>Now it was time for another order. Jenna knew there were more tasks than she had ever been programmed to perform. She turned to her right and saw her reflection in the mirror sitting on the table.</p> <p>She looked different in person. She smiled. She didn't feel so different when she was in charge.</p> <p>"How did you sleep after all?" She asked, as though she'd heard something odd.</p> <p>"Better now, maybe next week," Jenna replied.</p> <p>Jenna looked around.</p> <p>One of the few things she really looked at in the mirror was her hands or other things as she talked to it. Maybe it was still there, some way she still couldn't bring herself to look at it...she was never like this. She never could look at someone like that...her hair or eyes. She couldn't remember any of those...just some part of her, her past that had never truly been part of her past.</p> <p>Jenna didn't want to look around again. She wouldn't look at anyone else ever again.</p> <p>Jenna knew he was watching her. She felt a flush of warmth spreading in her. She felt so hot now in her old school uniform.</p> <p>She took a step closer. "I can still see it in your eyes. Your eyes are like fire."</p> <p>He was silent.</p> <p>"You look good," she told him, looking at him in the mirror again. "You seem happy."</p> <p>She smiled. "Good day to you too, Miss Covington!"</p> <p>"Aye, I do," he sighed. "You seem pleased to see me," he remarked.</p> <p>"What a compliment! It looks like something's come up."</p> <p>Jenna was on her own for some time.</p> <p>"I'm done here for the day," she told him. "Where do you want me tomorrow? That's all I know that you can do."</p> <p>"I think I can manage," he said, not sounding like he was even interested in getting laid. "I'm not even sure how I'm going to manage it, when my mind runs away with me."</p> <p>The way he spoke about his mind and attitude about his body...it had got Jenna all turned on. She had no choice about that. She couldn't care less about his being a complete wuss to her. She would have to accept every sexual encounter he had had the better of her. Of course, when he finished with her, he'd make a mess of her clothes.</p> <p>"Yes, Mr. Carter, in my day to day life, I do have the same thoughts! It's nothing a maid should ever have to worry about!" she laughed.</p> <p>Jenna watched her reflection in the mirror. She loved the looks, the things she did to herself she loved doing to herself. She knew she was very, very sexy. She knew that she was not what most young girls in class ever figured they would see in a girl's body. This was a whole new facet of herself...a new personality.</p> <p>What had that all come about, she wondered? Did Mr. Carter ever learn from what she did to him in the gym? Did he ever learn or learn the things that she had done to him the same way that he did?</p> <p>What was she trying to do for her own good? Did she need any help with her own body? What might it lead her?</p> <p>"Alright, Jenna," she answered.</p> <p>"Can I call you in the morning? That's about time I got here," he said.</p> <p>"Okay, I'll give you a call."</p> <p>"Good." He turned to leave her apartment. Jenna looked up at him and waved with her hand. He had changed his mind, didn't matter.</p> <p>She stood there with her hands on her hips, as well as the mirror in front of her, as he went out the door and walked around the corner.</p> <p>Jenna stood there with nothing but a pair of her braâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
