She looked back at her computer and quickly typed out 'I'm sorry, I thought we'd done a better job'.</p> <p>The guy's grin was one of relief and pleasure, Cindy smiled back at him. He looked at her, taking a moment to admire her body, she was wearing a simple, pale pink teddy that had the words "Sexy Garter" printed on the front, it was almost transparent, and he could see that she had no stockings underneath it. His heart started pounding in his chest.</p> <p>He reached out his hand and held hers. They smiled and shook hands and said "hi" to each other. They shared an awkward kiss, her on the cheek and him in the head.</p> <p>"So what's up? Why the long face?" she asked.</p> <p>"Don't know. It just... I feel... like this whole day would be more than that if it never happened." he said, "I'd hate to get my hopes high."</p> <p>Cindy could feel how this conversation sounded bad, but she felt really good at being with him, and she hoped that they could come to another day. He smiled and she smiled back and he kissed her cheek, not wanting to let her go.</p> <p>The kiss was long and passionate, she ran her finger through his hair, "I really missed you." she said softly and he nodded and she smiled.</p> <p>After a second or two their hands wandered across each other's clothing, he pulled back the teddy as she pulled his shirt out of his pants. Cindy's fingers were running down his chest and stomach as he pulled the teddy down and off his hips. She pulled his pants down and he stepped out of them. He stepped out of them too, he looked around.</p> <p>"The front door has cameras!" he thought to himself.</p> <p>Cindy ran back to the computer, "oh. I can't do it here. I won't be able to find out where anyone is."</p> <p>They smiled and he nodded. Cindy got down on her knees in front of him, and in front of the camera on the stand she was lying down in front of. She stood up and turned and smiled at the camera on the stand, but her hands dropped the teddy as she turned away. She stood up again, the camera on the stand caught her naked body as she dropped to her knees between his legs.</p> <p>"Wow. I'm looking at these shots!" she said as she looked at the photos on her computer.</p> <p>He took several shots as he looked at them.</p> <p>"Where'd you get those? I'd have thought that I'd be able to work with them at school."</p> <p>There were a lot of the right photos. Some were from a different angle, like when she was laying on her back as a child, and some of that were shots of her kneeling on the top bench with her legs wide open; they showed her pussy on a beach as a young boy, and even on her stomach, a picture of her standing in a pool of urine.</p> <p>"How long did this take?" Cindy asked.</p> <p>He grinned. "Too long. If it weren't for that picture, I'd be with you right now!"</p> <p>Cindy smiled and took his cock into her hands. "Your cock belongs with me!" she said as she looked up at him.</p> <p>He stood up, took her in his arms and embraced her. He pulled him to his feet and kissed her hard, his tongue thrusting into her mouth. His hands slid down her back and she moved her backside against his cock. They kissed for a long time, kissing, stroking and touching, kissing, kissing, kissing. They both moaned.</p> <p>"I have one more thing for you before we get comfortable! Now I'm going to take you in the bedroom" he said.</p> <p>He opened the door and walked with her into the bedroom.</p> <p>"Now just hold on. Let me guide you!"</p> <p>While she had watched him enter the house she had been in the kitchen, the kitchen was fairly dark, but they could probably make out a lot of clothes lying there. The bedroom had only one bed... well, another side. The curtains were closed, the lights were off, there was soft music and the only sound was the soft stroking of Cindy's tongue against his lips as they were wrapped around his cock. She was moaning and breathing hard from the touch of him as he pulled her close. Her hands were stroking his dick up it's length, the head was glistening with her saliva before she reached the head with her tongue and she slid it all the way to the head which she took into her mouth, she slid her lips down the shaft and sucked his cock, she sucked his cock untilâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
