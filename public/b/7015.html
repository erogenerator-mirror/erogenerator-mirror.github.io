When our lips met, I felt her lips part so mine would meet hers. I ran my hand up her side, my fingers trailing down the front of her chest until I was reaching to the back of her bra. My fingers slid under and hooked the edge of it. I slid my fingers underneath to the front and then back. She was soft and sweet and I was in heaven. When I pulled back, I looked into her eyes. They were full and dark, and her lips were wet. I could see the promise of moisture in them, and her breath was coming quicker and quicker. She was breathing hard, and she pulled lightly at my hand with hers. We broke the kiss and glanced at the clock.</p> <p>"Can I get a few minutes of your company then?" I asked.</p> <p>She looked at me, a smile on her face as she asked, "Will I have a chance to do that?"</p> <p>My answer was a soft, "Yes."</p> <p>"I hope it's worth it," she added, and then reached behind her to loosen the bra. She pulled it away while I watched. My eyes followed the movement of the bra as she tossed the bra to the side. I almost lost it.</p> <p>That's when her breasts came into view. My wife was not the smallish girl of many people. She was a bit bigger. I could see the small puffy nipples peeking out the front of her bras. Her areolas were darker pink and I could see the small crinkles between her breasts. Her breasts were perky and small, with small nipples. I saw the areolas start at the back then disappear in between small rosy areolas. One of her nipples, dark as night, slipped out of its prison and met my view.</p> <p>My mouth was dry from the look on my wife's face. Mandy stood behind her holding her shoulders back. Her large breasts hung down in front of her, a light tan line showing on the right side of her breast. Her skin was smooth and perfect, like a porcelain dish, and I could tell where each of her buttons came together, almost from above. I leaned forward so I could see the lower half of her bra strap and the top button of the front. My fingers ran up and over hers. We stood there looking at her breasts for a moment.</p> <p>"Like what I think I see?" I asked.</p> <p>"Definitely," my wife answered with a little smile.</p> <p>Then her bra cups came loose and she pushed her shoulders back. My eyes followed them. They looked a little larger than I had anticipated. She was wearing tan colored trim bikini panties that matched the color of her bra. The color matched the shade on her face. I took a hold of her hand. We took long, slow steps toward the table.</p> <p>"Here's the deal," she said to me, taking in the scene I was about to propose to my wife. "If you agree to the same deal, we'll see what happens together."</p> <p>"What if we just stop now?" I asked.</p> <p>"We won't," she replied with a smile. "We'll let the games take their course. Just try to enjoy the feel of them, then decide if this is what you really want."</p> <p>"Sure" I agreed. "Can I put these in my cart in the ladies room?"</p> <p>"You can do it now if it's the last time."</p> <p>"Can I look, too?"</p> <p>We laughed. Mandy pulled me out to the hallway. "It's no need to rush. Don't be silly, I'm not interested in watching you, I've seen more, and maybe more."</p> <p>Once we reached the door, we hesitated. My cock was beginning to rise, and I wondered if Mandy could see it. Was she turned on by what we had planned? I turned to her, and she smiled at me. As we walked out into the hall, I took my hand, she took mine, and we led the way to our respective rooms. Mandy stopped at the first door.</p> <p>"Do each of you have a toothbrush?" she asked.</p> <p>I reached for the toothpaste to show her the box I bought for her. She grinned.</p> <p>"You like these," she said, handing me a toothbrush.</p> <p>The toothpaste had a small mouth toothpick, but it was still an interesting item. I picked up the toothbrush and turned around to examine her. Mandy grabbed my hand and we kissed. There was nothing to do but kiss and touch this woman.
