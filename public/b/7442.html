I couldn't control it.</p> <p>"Yeah, I thought it would take a change of pace, to not be as hard as I wanted to be," I smiled at him. "A new and improved pace that I couldn't have imagined before."</p> <p>I watched as he got out of bed, his eyes never leaving me. I couldn't help but compare myself with him as I watched him put on his clothes. I was thinking of what he looked like naked, as he walked around in his pajamas and then I felt self conscious as my eyes traveled downwards to his body. I was getting wet, not because of just having me eyes, but because I wanted to get at his penis, so much that it had now been a week since I had last gotten at it, but because I actually wanted to touch it. I wanted to have a look at a penis to compare.</p> <p>He walked past me and I watched him head to the door. I didn't really feel like going, but at the same time I just wanted to get in the shower, then shower again. Once outside I began to take off my clothes, and as soon as I did I grabbed my towel and ran to my bed. I threw it over the side in a hurry, but soon it fell to the floor, where I quickly turned it inside out and jumped under the sheet.</p> <p>I laid there for while, not saying anything, still thinking of what was possible that we had to go through, just getting ready for the weekend before we said anything to anyone, even Mark. Finally I heard his door open and close, and before I knew it I heard him coming up the stairs. I lay there, my eyes shut, hoping that this might somehow be a short while before I had to leave for the weekend, or something else. Nothing happened.</p> <p>Finally, I heard footsteps on the stairs, and as far as I could tell the whole place was empty, so I opened my eyes and looked up the stairs, towards the room where they were. I couldn't even tell when the footsteps stopped, so I kept my eyes focused on them.</p> <p>It was just a voice I couldn't see clearly at first but when I opened my eyes again I saw that it was the same person from last night. This time she was looking back at me. And I found myself staring at her. Her hair was pulled back, exposing her beautiful neck. Her beautiful face was hidden beneath a layer of mascara, and I could see the tip of her nose, her mouth curved slightly in a small smile.</p> <p>She seemed to be looking at me a little differently than the night before, but I was beginning to think I already knew. Before I knew it my mouth started dry, when she stood in front of me and pulled one of the blinds open. I didn't react as she took another step towards me. I tried to do the same as I stood on my tip toes and took the blindfold out of her hands.</p> <p>"We're going to talk here, in the bedroom, sweetie!" she said as she put one arm around my throat and the other around my body.</p> <p>She turned me slowly so that I was looking down her body. She leaned in close to my face, our lips barely touching. Her hand was still in front of me, and as our lips touched, the moment was magical, but even though we kissed this time slowly and quietly, it was still an incredible kiss. Her hand wrapped around my lower back, and the kiss quickly turned to something much more intimate, and more passionate. I wrapped my arms around her waist, and as we kissed I found myself slipping one hand down to her thigh.</p> <p>As we broke our embrace, she looked into my eyes for a minute, and I didn't know how to respond. I had my own questions all ready made up, and before long all of them came rushing back and I couldn't really explain them to her. Finally she let go of me, and I followed her into the bedroom. She had me turn on the bed so that I was lying down flat, with my head resting on the pillows. She stood back a moment, watching my face as I continued to stare at her.</p> <p>She stood there for a moment and seemed almost to gather her nerves. She came to me, placing one hand on each of my arms. I felt a sudden, amazing sensation in my left shoulder.</p> <p>"Relax aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
