She said. "What's up? What's taking you by surprise?"</p> <p>"Well, I was wondering if you were ever gonna go away and get a beer from my parents and we were just going to hang out for a while. How does that sound?"</p> <p>Jenny thought for a minute. "Well, sure... that sounds great!" She said with a smile. "But what if there was someone watching?"</p> <p>"I don't know... they might be watching. Let's go in front of it."</p> <p>"Yeah, let's go inside" Said Jenny, taking her car keys, her wallet, and her purse off the counter and opening the door.</p> <p>After Jenny got inside, she gave Mike a quick look up and down and said "Let me know if you see any funny-looking, or if someone is around." She looked over at him and saw him trying not to look, and turned back to the liquor store.</p> <p>"No, come on!"</p> <p>"Okay." Jenny said as she went to the counter and opened the door for Mike. He followed her inside the store and watched her ass as she walked. His cock began to harden as he went back to the bar and sat down to get ready for work, but Jenny stopped right behind him.</p> <p>"Have a good night." She said, with a smile as she leaned down and kissed his cheek.</p> <p>As soon as she closed the door behind Mike, he grabbed his crotch, and said "Just a couple minutes, no, I'll be back in a few." As Jenny walked away from him, she could see that his bulge had a very good affect on both him and Jenny.</p> <p>Mike returned to the bar as Jenny was starting to get around him. Mike smiled at Jenny and said "Nice outfit!"</p> <p>"Thanks. I was thinking about something a little different tonight." Jenny gave Mike a sly look up and down, as if she was thinking a little different thoughts, as well as trying to pick a better outfit to wear that night. After closing off the drink section in front of Mike, Jenny returned to the bar to see the guy she had been working with earlier coming in.</p> <p>Jenny sat down to pour him a couple drinks while Mike ordered another beer. He started to get up when Jenny said that she had a few ideas for him to wear. She wanted to ask him something, but she thought that would be a little too much.</p> <p>Mike smiled with a big smile as Jenny asked him "Is that a girl's name"? He looked at Jenny in surprise then said "Jenny." Jenny turned around to see the man she had been chatting with a minute ago coming in. She could see his black leather pants tighten as he looked at Jenny.</p> <p>"She is definitely Jenny." Mike said to Jenny.</p> <p>"Well, she's a real cutie." Jenny answered as she looked at Mike's face and saw a man's eyes roll back in their sockets from Jenny's ass. "Oh, my pants... what are you doing in here?" A very large black man said.</p> <p>"It's not like, 'us guys need to get beers for guys, we're just having a little fun.' You guys can just hang out a while, okay, okay." Jenny tried to cover up to try and keep a conversation going, while continuing to drink her third beer "What can I get you guys for those?"</p> <p>He smiled again. "I don't know." He said, "I think we are good looking guys."</p> <p>"Maybe we're not as ugly as our bodies." Jenny said.</p> <p>"No, no, it's okay. We're not going to do all that stuff." Mike said in a mock-impatient voice as he took another sip of his beer.</p> <p>Mike's voice had a serious tone in it, as he said again, "I had better get this beer back now." But again he didn't say it in the same way as before.</p> <p>Jenny couldn't help but laugh at his comment, because she suddenly felt very horny at the thought of being with Mike again. "What? Where did you even get that idea?" Jenny said, as she leaned back into the bar and began again talking to him.</p> <p>"I don't think they have any alcohol in here." Mike said, "I thought you were just looking for a good little fuck buddy." Jenny smiled and thought to herself "What am I doing here? I can't even say that I'm dating Mike like that." Mike laughed. While Jenny had been laughing at her own joke, Mike felt a little flustered. He was trying to figure out just how he felt just now. He looked down and caught the guy he had been talking with before staring atâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
