"So, I take it you are ready."</p> <p>"Oh, yes I am" she whispered. "Please, please do it to me. I would die for you!"</p> <p>"Not yet," I insisted. "You know that this is for real. This is a first date. I'll just do the first part. You can decide at this time. Now I have a really strong feeling that you are really sexy, and I know you are ready."</p> <p>She was now trembling with anticipation. "Please, I want it. I want sex with you. I want to make love," she said.</p> <p>"Yes, I think you do. I think you really want to, darling."</p> <p>As I lay on the bed, ready to be in charge, she knelt on the bed and looked into my eyes.</p> <p>"Please, I, I want this, please."</p> <p>"Honey, I really am ready, just tell me what you want. Then decide right now!"</p> <p>She kissed me gently, her full, soft lips feeling amazing.</p> <p>"I, am really horny, just want to feel sex."</p> <p>"That's why I've got to do this," I said. "Just relax and give in to it. You're going to let the world know just how badly you want it"</p> <p>She gently pulled me on top of the covers and reached her hand inside my panties to feel my warm, moist pussy. I leaned back and watched, mesmerized as she teased my lips and I closed my eyes as she stroked with one finger and pulled my clitoris between her lips with the other. I wanted to say something. I wanted to shout out, I wanted to tell this beautiful, wonderful woman to do what I had always dreamed it would. I couldn't speak, but I could feel the tension in my legs start to build. As I reached a climax, a wave of intense pleasure swept through my body, my knees buckled and I screamed in ecstasy. My back arched as I came down, and the feeling of pleasure was indescribable.</p> <p>After an eternity of lying there, recovering, I suddenly realized that she was still on the bed, laying on her side with one thigh up against her body.</p> <p>"I see you didn't bring some change of clothes," she gasped, with an incredibly sexy and sultry look in her eyes.</p> <p>"No, silly. It's still a bit of a change of clothes. I think it's time that you got changed."</p> <p>"How?"</p> <p>"Come here and lay there with me."</p> <p>"Can't I just go to my own room?" she breathed. "It's all in the heat of the moment, and I really hope we have time to get to know each other."</p> <p>"It's not just that. I'm just going to have a little walk, and then I'm going to go up to my room and find my underwear to put on, OK?" I laughed wickedly. "It seems like this was a bad idea all along!"</p> <p>"Not only that, but I want to make love again. I've had sex with women, men too, before." She smiled and lay on her back. "That is one way to treat a friend." She laughed and said, "And I'll be right back." And then she turned over, and I laid back on the bed. She lay next to me, and we embraced and kissed. We were both exhausted. Her beautiful soft body on mine was really touching and sensual. I was overwhelmed by the way she was lying next to me, and I started to drift off to sleep. As I did, I could feel my heart pounding and racing. I could feel that this was truly a first date, but it was the start of a long, passionate friendshipâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
