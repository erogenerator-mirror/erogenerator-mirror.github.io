After a few minutes my hand wandered down to Sarah's mound and felt a rush of arousal run through me. Sarah was wet, and she had already removed her panties. I could smell the musky smell of her arousal and suddenly I was rock hard for her. I gently pushed her leg apart and began to work my tongue and lips on her hot pussy, bringing her near to her first orgasm since we moved in with the company. Sarah responded by thrusting her pussy hard into my face and squeezing my head tightly between her legs. Her hands were on my head working herself towards another orgasm, and I could tell that it was inevitable.</p> <p>I continued to suck her as her body tensed and quivered with her orgasm, the waves of pleasure pulsing through her belly. I sucked her juices off my lips, trying to prolong the sensations that were building in her body. A few minutes later she pulled my face up and kissed me, gently biting my lower lip as she tasted herself on my tongue. She pulled back and gazed into my eyes for a few moments, while lightly running her fingertips across my cheeks.</p> <p>"That was... amazing", she whispered. "That was the hottest thing I have ever done, lover, ever done, it was beyond words. That was..." Her sentence trailed off as her own pleasure took centre stage once again.</p> <p>"We will have to try again a little later", I said, trying to convince myself to go on with our plan for the next day. I gently kissed her lips and ran my tongue across her teeth and the soft pink flesh, tasting and smelling her as I did so.</p> <p>Sarah reached over and took the covers off the bed once again, making sure that the blankets were all pushed under the pillows. She spread a towel on the bed, lying on it and I moved it aside and got between her legs. I took her legs and rested them on my shoulders, making sure that she didn't get the slightest bit uncomfortable. Just the thought of my body covering her with my body had me aroused beyond belief and I could feel her wet pussy lips pressing against the inside of my thighs. I rubbed my fingers over the lips, trying to work the delicate skin as much as possible. Sarah pushed her pelvis towards me each time I rubbed her, making each stroke of my finger harder and more intense. After a few minutes I looked up at Sarah who had one leg tucked under my other, raising herself to give me access to her even deeper.</p> <p>We continued to masturbate each other with the intensity we had reached. I tried to think of a way to increase the intensity and speed of the strokes, but found it impossible to even think of a way. Suddenly Sarah stopped moving her hips, letting me do most of my work. I used my left hand to rub her abdomen, as I used my other hand to tease the small patch of hair nestled in her bush. I could feel her body beginning to quiver from her orgasm, and I could sense a hint of a smile playing on her lips as she did so. I could also sense her body tensing up, her breathing becoming deep and even more rapid, as her breathing increased. I could already feel a tingling in my loins that I had come to recognize as my own. I took a deep breath and started to lick around her clit.</p> <p>It felt as if my tongue had been turned on and vibrated on her clit, making it tingle in anticipation of what I was about to do. She seemed to come to the very brink of her second orgasm, which was quite intense when I sucked her bud into my mouth and rolled it around with my tongue. I felt her body quiver under my mouth and she began to buck her hips against my face as she pushed against me trying to force me deeper. I worked for a few more moments before she pushed herself up and began to pull away from me.</p> <p>I was stunned but continued to rub her body against me as she slowly moved off of me. She lay down next to me and we both relaxed, my cock still hard, despite the pleasure it had just given her. The heat radiated from her body through my body and I had been feeling my body getting warmer by the minute, as my cock had been. She reached out her arms and put her head on my shoulder as she caressed my chest over the shirt I was wearing. There was a look of pure elation in her eyes that was just as sexy as the sex we had just shared.</p> <p>"I love you", she whispered</p> <p>"I love you too"</p> <p>I moved next to her and she held me tight. There was a slight sadness in her face as she spoke to me, as if she were trying to console me, but she just couldn't bring herself to say the words that I wanted to hear her sayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
