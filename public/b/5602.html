That day, which Jason and Brenda had had since their seventh anniversary, we were sitting watching a video we had rented together. Jason had put on a long and lusty tape when suddenly the door flew open and Brenda walked in. Then she just stood there holding the camera, completely oblivious to Jason's presence. The camera angle changed as Jason was looking right into the camera and suddenly his face appeared. My eyes were drawn to his face. There was a long pause between their faces and suddenly I saw Jason's eyes flick back and forth, indicating that something was up.</p> <p>There was a definite bulge under his shorts and I could see that, no doubt, he was getting turned on, but I didn't know it. As I sat there I wasn't sure if Brenda was aware of my presence or not. Just then Jason said, "I need to see these." and, with a little "click," of the camera, he slid the front of his shorts down, revealing to me, not only his erection, but also the outline of his very erect pole with bulging veins.</p> <p>My eyes were drawn to the length of his rod and as I watched him I noticed that it was clearly thick and longer than just an average dick. I couldn't see anything through the material of his shorts but from what I could tell, he had a very tight pouch, which had the appearance of being completely impaled with a tube. The outline of his mushroom head was completely outlined with a dark, wet outline. I felt a rush of blood to my rapidly beating cock. But Jason was clearly in complete bliss, enjoying the show with his hands on his chest and his lips stretched into a seductive smile.</p> <p>"Go on," he said. I took off my shirt and shorts and sat there in all my glory, naked except for my bikini panties which were dangling in a pool of my own juices on the end of the end table. I felt really embarrassed to be wearing that kind of clothing. My cock was completely deflated due to the intense arousal of staring at Jason's muscular body just feet away. I was glad it was just between us, I knew how it felt. It was an awkward position to sit in, but I wanted this to go on for as long as possible so I put my feet on the ground and spread my legs, just a little. I really liked being able to rub my balls or my dick through the skimpy panties that were stuck to my body, especially when, just as it was, they were very moist.</p> <p>Jason sat back and looked at the photos and said, "Oh yes. I was just looking at those, but you are absolutely beautiful and sexy and everything!"</p> <p>As Jason was saying this, my own cock had jumped to attention. I knew it was painful and that my cock head was still visible, even if I'm not very thick, despite the fact that it was so wet in there. But I was embarrassed that so many people would think of me as "that thing", even though it had looked as if I should be, but I wasn't, at least until Jason had been saying how pretty Brenda was. After he had said that Brenda had obviously caught him doing this, I noticed that the outline of Jason's cock was clearly visible just below his crotch; it also seemed as if there would be one bulge in the front of his shorts that would be visible.</p> <p>He said, "So, what do you want to do or should we do now?". I stood up and slowly started to remove my panties. When my hands had taken them off, I took them away from Jason and put them on the end table before I even had the chance to take the first step. I also took my bikini off, as well. I had on a red, short-sleeved dress with a black satin stripe and matching bra and panty set. I didn't have anything else on at that point.</p> <p>Jason said, "That's fine dear! Let's go upstairs, right on time!"</p> <p>We had already had our sexual experience together and Jason seemed to think that it would do, so I guess, I felt a little better as I followed Jason down the stairs. As I followed him down with my panties, I almost thought we would be walking through a field of ivy, but, at the same time, I wasn't too sure, the sight of my naked body walking down that hallway would cause my cock to be even harder, with the image of a penis entering someone else's body. At the moment the thoughts I was having were just fantasies, not really. As Jason entered the livingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
