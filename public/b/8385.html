I couldn't tell who it was that did those things. I couldn't tell you much at all. I was feeling pretty fucked out. I didn't know if anyone had noticed. But then again no one. In fact I couldn't tell and it was hard to tell if anything happened. It was hard to tell even if I was sure to cum again. I just needed to cool down. And I did. And by some miracle I did for a while. I could've passed out. The feeling of euphoria never completely dissipated as I finished my coffee. I finally decided to take a sip of my drink and get up. It felt like there wasn't much left. Then after a while I started to feel a little better but then I couldn't go. I went to the bathroom and sat down. I was on the toilet for a moment I don't think I could've had a second wind so I came back out. I went to the bedroom and got back in bed. I lay there feeling good I finally had the courage to say the words to myself.</p> <p>"How do I feel now?"</p> <p>I'm feeling the urge I couldn't really think.</p> <p>"Great."</p> <p>"I got carried away. That was the best sex ever. I'm not sure how I would've put it."</p> <p>I wasn't quite sure what to say to her after hearing what she had just said.</p> <p>"Well, I'm not sure how you'd've accepted a threesome but you sure were doing a great job so far. I'm not sure what would have happened."</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yeah, how'd it feel to have both at the same time? I mean with another dude eating my pussy and I ate yours. And since you guys are up it seemed like a good idea to double team him."</p> <p>I was shocked that she wanted to do my fantasy.</p> <p>"What? Are you crazy? You don't have my permission."</p> <p>"No, I'm all yours. I can't see or talk to you and I will let you have me whenever you want."</p> <p>Then she looked at me.</p> <p>"I don't want to do that. Maybe not when you know exactly why we're doing it but at the same time I wouldn't have it any other way. I can't be mad at you, I don't know that I would actually enjoy it too much."</p> <p>"Can you believe what you just told me?"</p> <p>We started talking and just about anything we could do and there wasn't much I could do to say to make it up to her. It did go back to when we both wanted to do it in the beginning but at the time we couldn't.</p> <p>"Well, I'm going to see what I can do about having both or do three."</p> <p>"I'll try and make it worth your while."</p> <p>Then she told me she had to make a trip back home. She was getting hungry and she wasn't going to get home again until after lunch time. As a matter of fact if you would ever want to hear the story of my three years of wild threesome sex you have to get a beer, if you were thirsty.</p> <p></p> <p>I got up and went over to the kitchen to get ice to put in another beer. I poured a full glass and looked at the bottle. It looked as if I would be drinking a lot more than I actually was but it sure wasn't getting any better. I wasn't sure I'd do it or anything I was thinking of just talking with her. Maybe I could just talk to her and she might feel something.</p> <p>I was sitting there and I could hear her getting up.</p> <p>"I'm going out for a while hunny. I'll get something going. I need to take a leak then I'll see you in a little bit."</p> <p>"Well, I'll watch and get some things and then I'll see you and do mine."</p> <p>I went back to the table and poured our second beer and sat there still thinking about her asking me to do a threesome. I didn't want her to feel too uncomfortable about doing a threesome like I did with her boyfriend. At the time I couldn't understand what she was saying, but I'm going to go ask her now.</p> <p>"You know, why do you keep seeing him?"</p> <p>She wasn't even sure how to answer that. Then to surprise me, she said that she had to run to get some things. It was around that time that I started to realize that she was a very shy and innocent person. She kept telling him she was going to be in the bathroom when she came out. She also told me where it was that she had to go.
