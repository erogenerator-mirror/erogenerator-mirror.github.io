One by one she moved the zip down, her hands rubbing my shorts and then tugging down so my cock was revealed and now standing proudly from my body, I moaned at the sensation from the contact. I could feel my balls tighten and swell, she knew this and moved me to another position. She slid my shorts down my legs and took hold of my cock with its purple head still semi erect. She ran her fingers over it, then began to lick along its length. It felt heavenly. I looked down at the two of us naked in the water, watching her, the water running over her body and the beautiful shape of her figure. I leaned forward to suck her nipples and she took charge of my cock.</p> <p>Taking both of her nipples I began to rub myself against the outside of the boat. She leaned in to kiss me, our lips locked, our tongues entwined, our breath mingling. She broke the kiss and pushed herself back towards me. Taking hold of my cock she guided it into her pussy and moved it around inside her in slow motion, she moaned softly and I could feel her pussy tighten around me and the wetness increase as it gripped my erect cock. She sat on me, and began to move on top of me. I slid one hand up her body, the other I ran through her hair and over her shoulders. Her movements were slow and deliberate, she moved slowly at first, her breasts swaying side to side with each motion. Her tongue was licking my mouth and I could feel the electricity run through me as she moved her body against mine. I pushed her up onto her knees, she took hold of my thighs and moved herself up to meet me, then began to roll her hips against me again. I felt the weight of her breasts on my chest as she continued to fuck me. I took hold of her by her hips and pulled her hard against the boat, her breath as I thrust and then her as I thrust. We ground ourselves together in short thrusts, my hands on her breasts and her hips coming harder and faster with each stroke. Our rhythm built until we both began to cry out in pleasure. Her fingers were digging into my thighs as we fucked, but I knew she would not move and continue as she would with our bodies, it was as if it were slow motion. I thrust harder, she responded, and with each thrust came down harder, our bodies meeting and coming together.</p> <p>"We are moving faster, we are going to cum, I am so close," she moaned in my ear.</p> <p>"I won't, it will be over soon." I whispered back to her. I then slid her off of me and took her hand onto my shoulder with a final kiss, then she took my cock and guided it back into her soaking wet pussy. Pushing my hand back into her, she began to move and move on top of me, my hand running over her body, the waves lapping at the shore, our tongues intertwined. I couldn't hold back, I thrust and thrust and thrust, my body moving all about the pleasure she was giving me. Our bodies slammed together until we both came together. We kissed, our lips crushed together and my tongue thrusting through the silky wetness of our tongues. My body moved in time with hers just as her fingers moved inside me again, and she was fingered to orgasm.</p> <p>She moved her hand and my fingers into new places and began to pump me as I thrust myself at her as her finger fucked her in circles inside me in time with my own movements. As I climaxed I felt her body tense and then I was exploding inside her as our orgasms pulsated together. It was one of the most sensual orgasms I had ever had. Her body quivered as she moved and collapsed on top of me, her arms around my neck.</p> <p>We collapsed to the water and I could feel my cum running from her pussy and the water mixing with her juices. We lay still together for a while, our breathing slowing. I held her to me and she rested her head in my shoulder. I held her, stroking the softness of her back and arms, I could never tell how many hours we spent that glorious week, and all those memories of the moment. We both had a good glow about us, and that was what made us feel so wonderful.</p> <p>We parted and looked at one another. She was in her bathrobe but she was smilingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
