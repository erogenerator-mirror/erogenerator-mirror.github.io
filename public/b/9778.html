Is that good?"</p> <p>I was still sitting there with my hand on my cock and my head was back, my face turned to one side as I was, in fact, looking at the ceiling. After a few seconds, I felt the first stirrings of an orgasm.</p> <p>"Wow. You taste good like this," I said, almost to myself.</p> <p>I continued moving my head back and forth as I continued moving my hand up and down. I could feel my cock starting to get harder as I started to pick up the pace, faster and faster.</p> <p>"Oh, God, I'm going to come," I said, almost as if an animal could just out of it.</p> <p>"Is that what you want? Do you want me to come on your face?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes, do it," I heard myself say as my hand got more and more frantic.</p> <p>"God, you're beautiful," I said after a few more seconds of the same.</p> <p>"Yes, I want you to come on my face. I want you to cum on my face. Come in my face," I said in almost a strangled voice.</p> <p>The whole thing was amazing now. The whole time my fist was moving in and out of my ass, it was making me even more excited then before. By the time I got the last few strokes on my cock, I started to feel my semen start to boil into the boiling point in my gut. Just like when I did it when I was masturbating, I put my head down and opened my eyes and opened my mouth as if in a trance.</p> <p>I looked down and saw that my hand was still stroking my cock, it was still shiny with the stuff that had shot its way up out of me. I had never had it that way done before. Not to my wife, but I wanted to. The thought that it wasn't her was exciting me as much as the idea of it. I didn't think anything like it would ever go into it's own business.</p> <p>"That was fantastic," I said when I was finally done with my eyes.</p> <p>"Yes," she said.</p> <p>After a moment's hesitation, I felt the need to say so again.</p> <p>"That was incredible, but I have to stop now. I just can't get over it."</p> <p>"You're just being yourself again, Jimmy."</p> <p>That seemed to satisfy me enough for me. She stood up, and just as she did, the bedside lamp came on again. We both looked at each other, and she smiled at me.</p> <p>"That was fantastic, but I have to get up early in the morning. Could we do it again sometime?"</p> <p>"Of course, we'll do it again, whenever you want," I agreed, knowing that she wasn't a morning person.</p> <p>"Ok, I'll see you around 8."</p> <p>"Make sure you put some clothes on, it's my fault for walking in there and seeing me like that. But I'll be around until you get up, and I'll be ready to be your wife as you know it. I can't wait to see you, because your going to be making love in a minute. We have to hurry," Jennifer said as she hugged me tenderly and got out of bed.</p> <p>The next morning, they had the pool and the housekeeper sent her on her way. A few of her friends came over to make breakfast. I couldn't help but think about where that could all lead, not for another minute. I didn't want to think about anything else right then, so I went back into the bedroom and sat down on the bed, hoping that something would come of that now. It never did.</p> <p>In the meantime, in the meantime, I was trying to figure out how to keep my mind from thinking about what had happened before. I mean, how could I not think about what happened, how things had unfolded, how everything was normal, if they were normal. I had no desire to think about that. I just kept trying to think about everything I could think of while trying to think about anything else.</p> <p>I'm not sure how many or how many of our friends I knew at that time, but they were all at least as much at it. It seems like that the most important thing at that time was the man that you should always turn around to see more. If you can really turn your mind, you always have. I never thought that I ever saw or had seen someone else having an orgasm, but those were the days. I'm guessing that you are probably wondering about that for the rest of your life, or at least how it was that you got yourself so excited at having sex.</p> <p>One reason or another, if they have any, that I can't seeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
