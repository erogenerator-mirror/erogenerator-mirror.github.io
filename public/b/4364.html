They had said, "No, not for this. This is private." She had declined to do this but had not asked them.</p> <p>They were looking at her for a long time. It wasn't that she didn't want to do the things that they were asking her to do. It was she knew they were looking at her because she seemed to like them and so they hadn't asked her to do anything she didn't want to do. Still, after so many years, she found herself being turned on by them and wanting more.</p> <p>"There is something else that needs to be done," she said. "This has to be done."</p> <p>"It is something that can or will happen. And it will happen."</p> <p>"What if your master does it? What will he do?"</p> <p>"There is no need for that now. My Master will not say no to anything."</p> <p>The next day, after she was released from her cage, she was again asked to clean. She did. Now she looked directly into the eyes of an older woman who held a mirror and saw there was a difference.</p> <p>She was taller, had smaller breasts. What she was doing was embarrassing, but she found this strange. She couldn't see it, but if she did she would have seen a difference, if she lifted her head and then touched her bottom. She had the strong desire to reach further to do something but she was reluctant, in a way.</p> <p>The woman, not looking away, smiled as she stood before her. She was about forty, a thin woman, with short hair with the ends combed back. Her eyes were wide, like her. She didn't seem to notice her. They looked at her face, her eyes, her body, and for quite some time they looked at her breasts. Each time their eyes came to the nipple the color changed from pale pink to a deep red.</p> <p>"I think he likes what he sees," she said. "I want to see his reaction."</p> <p>"Do you?" her other-partner replied, putting a hand on her shoulder. "He likes it, too."</p> <p>"Yes," she said, almost in a whisper.</p> <p>"Why don't you touch your own breasts? See how they do it."</p> <p>"I don't think I should."</p> <p>"Do you like being watched?" her companion asked.</p> <p>"Yes, I do."</p> <p>"May I?" she asked.</p> <p>Her companion nodded. "Your master, what do you think?"</p> <p>She hesitated. It was not a question. She nodded.</p> <p>"Do you want to be seen?"</p> <p>"I do," she said, then thought and said, "Yes, I do, but....."</p> <p>She looked at the mirror she now held and reached for her right breast. The mirror was clear. She cupped it and felt how she did with the other breast. In the mirror, she saw how it did. Her top was a red and it showed how much she liked the nipple. Her companion smiled. She squeezed her breast, she rubbed her hand over it.</p> <p>"Show him," she said. "Touch yourself. Show that you like it."</p> <p>She had started to think of herself as being a woman who didn't like or want anything. She was starting to see herself as that, a man who wasn't looking at her to feel her body, but he wasn't doing anything to encourage her.</p> <p>She stood, and walked over to where she knew her husband was watching. He looked over at her and smiled, then looked again and then waved.</p> <p>"That's good," she told them. "You're doing good. Show him."</p> <p>She stood before them, looking at the mirror. She had to do that. They were her masters now. She pulled her breast down so she looked down between them to see the difference. She saw the difference. Her own breast was showing and it was exciting her. No, not exciting her, but she had to make herself show it. She turned for them. When her breasts were out of the way, she looked down at her own belly. She could see it had changed. She could see her belly button too but there was an opening between her legs that her legs had not, and in her belly button. She felt wet between her legs.</p> <p>"She wants to see you," her guide said.</p> <p>"Please."</p> <p>"Her hands, take them," the other-partner said.</p> <p>She held them, her hands on her belly.</p> <p>"Show her. Let her see you."</p> <p>She did. Her hands went to her hips. She looked down. She pulled her hips down to the floor, liftingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
