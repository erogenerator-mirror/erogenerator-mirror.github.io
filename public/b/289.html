She had on the same outfit as that picture before and I could tell she had had some time to herself. The only thing that made it any clearer to me was that the shirt seemed really low-cut.</p> <p>She was still taking pictures, but I didn't care anymore. If we hadn't both been naked in her car the whole episode would have been a disaster—and it might possibly be a pretty good one. She still had her towel on and looked like she might be even more naked now.</p> <p>Our faces were inches apart and I could see the flush that came across her neck again. When I first saw it I felt as though my heart was going to stop there. Just my face, and even more when the image of my own daughter was slowly replaced by an image of my own daughter. I wanted to reach out and touch her, to cup her bare breast through the thin fabric of that shirt. I wanted to slide my hands through her long, dark brown hair, and cup her butt and hold her gently in my arms. But in the midst of that, I just couldn't.</p> <p>“Just a sec.” I said when I noticed that she didn't even look at me. It didn't seem like a request and didn't seem like an order, but it was a command. She knew what I'd done with my cum in her lap, all over her belly, on her legs, even on the roof of her car!</p> <p>I took my towel off—and her wet t-shirt came off without a protest. The front of the shirt stayed out of the way, but it was clear that it really wasn't covering anything.</p> <p>She didn't try to cover her breasts with her arms, but instead dropped the hand to her side so that I could get my picture of my daughter from a different vantage point. I saw her glance down at where my hand was, but didn’t stop her. She looked back the other way, and then up to see me smiling and shaking my head in mock disapproval of the gesture.</p> <p>I put a finger to my lips, and watched in silence as I watched my own daughter looking up from what I looked at and what I could tell was what her shirt was hiding from me.</p> <p>"How come your skirt is still up around your thighs?” I asked.</p> <p>Her head shot up. “No. I was thinking of leaving it. It gets way too wet. It was just about the way it was when I came over—"</p> <p>“Your daughter's pants are definitely wet now.”</p> <p>This time it was her turn to just stare down at the floor, like she never had the chance to look up from the picture she was looking at. I saw her hand reach out slowly and I had the feeling that she wasn't really moving it away. I think she was just shaking slightly.</p> <p>“She wasn't thinking of leaving it to me.”</p> <p>She just looked at me. But then I reached my finger out and pressed it directly against her mouth.</p> <p>She just stared at it for a moment, then leaned forward until her lips touched the fabric and it slid along the length of her mouth. She started to pull back, but then she let go and let me feel my finger slip against the fabric between her teeth. Again she leaned toward me, and though we both hadn't even opened our mouths any further than that the contact felt so intense it made me shudder.</p> <p>I saw her eyes drop again, but she didn't look away. Her hand reached out again to meet mine, but the contact was still very much the same. She looked back up into the pictures we had taken, not at me but at her own image.</p> <p>“My hands are all soaked now,” she said finally. “I don't think I can take them back any time soon.”</p> <p>I couldn't disagree with her, both with myself and then with her image.</p> <p>She pulled me to her again, and kissed me tenderly. “I’m hungry, aren’t I? Do you want to come upstairs with me?”</p> <p>I looked up at her sheepishly. “Do you, Mom? Should we leave?”</p> <p>She just smiled as though she thought I was on board with the plan. And I was. And it just felt like a good idea to see it again. We didn't really have to do it, we could go on seeing each other every day, or work some days off, just do it. But we would want it to happen for both of us. After all, it was kind of a surprise after all—but it was fun too. It just seemed so right, even though she didn't know why I felt that way—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
