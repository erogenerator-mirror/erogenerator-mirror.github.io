"You are so beautiful that when we kiss and touch, you make me feel very, very good."</p> <p>He kissed his way to her neck. "Why is that so?" He asked in a whisper. "Did you want us to do this just now?"</p> <p>"I want you to be with me tonight," she murmured. "I want you to touch every inch of my body. I want you to suck on my nipples. I want you to bite them. I want to be your pleasure slave. I'll have you."</p> <p>Her voice had a dangerous undertone that brooked no mercy. He had always enjoyed it when she had a dangerous edge.</p> <p>"You are too soft for that," he whispered. "But this is what I needed to hear." He placed a kiss on her lips, and began moving down her neck. She shivered as his tongue made contact with her skin. She pulled his face hard against her. "Please," she sighed. "Stop that."</p> <p>"You want me to stop?" he asked, almost insulted. "Aren't you a bitch and a tease?"</p> <p>"Yes," she whispered in a small voice.</p> <p>"I'm going to need a more direct approach. Is that okay?"</p> <p>She didn't want him to take his clothes off so easily. She had waited years for a man of any race. But it was always this one time to let their relationship grow from a platonic relationship to something even more intense. The first time she found herself with someone was with their first date. That lasted for less than twenty plus weeks.</p> <p>This man... this man was special to her. He was all she needed. She had found she could tell when a man was in love.</p> <p>And it had come to this point, this man who had stolen her heart. That's why she had let him take her.</p> <p>To take her for his pleasure. To suck on her tits. To lick her pussy.</p> <p>I'll be gentle, you know. Take your time. Please don't rush me.</p> <p>Yes, please.</p> <p>She couldn't resist. She reached up and pulled him down to her. They kissed again, tasting each other's mouths. They could kiss and talk without breaking time. It was so very good. He tasted like honey.</p> <p>But there was a difference. He had always tasted like honey.</p> <p>He took her face in his hand. "Kiss me," he whispered.</p> <p>She leaned closer to him and he slid his lips over hers. His lips touched hers. It was as if he gave her his own taste.</p> <p>"I've missed you so much," he whispered.</p> <p>"I'm glad you're here," she sighed. "And I hope we can do this again."</p> <p>"Anything for you."</p> <p>***************</p> <p>***************</p> <p>***************</p> <p>***************</p> <p>***************</p> <p>Krynn moved over in front of her daughter and asked, "Are you ready to play?" she asked softly.</p> <p>"You bet," Kyrenna said. "I want to watch you make my father cum in your mouth." She said her face a bright smile. "I hope you don't mind." She looked so happy to see her daughter. She couldn't wait for Ryna to taste more of his cum. In that moment she was happy she wouldn't.</p> <p>She pulled her father into her arms. "It's alright father" she whispered. "I love you so much. I'll never let you go again."</p> <p>Ryna smiled broadly at her father and pressed her lips to his.</p> <p>She felt his lips moving against hers. It felt so right. It felt so special. Ryna knew she belonged with him completely. She looked around for her mother. She looked for her sister-in-law. She felt so special. They had been so happy on this day.</p> <p>She looked at her mother and saw that she had to look at her mother or she would lose the mood. If she couldn't talk to Kyrenna there was a whole other option she would not turn to.</p> <p>Ryna looked at Kyrenna and saw herself smiling at her sister-in-law. It was perfect. Ryna felt so happy to have a woman for her father. To know if he thought of her as his daughter-in-law. He had known Kyrenna since she was a child, she was his little sister. But after all he had, he wanted something special for Ky.</p> <p>A tear ran down her eye. She hadn't seen her father like this in a long time. But it was only because of Kyrenna.
