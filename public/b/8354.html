"Okay, if I've got to," she began, "just go in there and hang this all up. This is mine." It was obviously an important part of the sales job. "If there's a job to be done, then so be it!" she said, as she pulled a shirt over her head. "Don't be mad at me for this." And, she put her shoes in the closet. The shirt was a little tight on her bust, but the shortness of it was enough to make her nipples stiffen as it hugged the material. "And, I'm sure you'll find this to be a comfortable night-time wear, but, please, don't hesitate to give it a chance. I really don't need for you to think you can just shove it up my ass."</p> <p>Sondra turned around and locked the door on the way to the bathroom, leaving the light on low. She took off the white towel and laid it down on the sink. She was so wet that the towel slipped down to the bottom. She was surprised the coolness of the paper made her legs quiver.</p> <p>Sondra stood at the sinks while I tried to keep my voice quiet. "There, there! Now, you're looking a bit red-faced."</p> <p>"Yeah, I am."</p> <p>Sondra smiled. It was a kind, friendly smile that was meant to be seen. "I'd like that." and then, "Do you really know that I was only in that outfit the first time you took me out? I mean, I don't think we'll get that much more serious than that." She turned, gave me a tight, sexy smile, and leaned in to kiss me. The kiss was very brief, with no tongue. But, as we kissed we felt a passion and passion that made us both feel like our hearts were racing.</p> <p>Sondra wrapped her arms around me and gently took my face between her lips. She let her tongue slip between my mouth with a soft, sensual moan. She gave each arm a long hard kiss. The tongue slipped into my mouth as I cupped her large, softness in my hand, feeling the softness of her breast. Her tongue slid past my lips as I cupped and squeezed her breast. I felt so sexy, my pussy tingled in an excited reaction to the soft, warm, fullness of her naked flesh.</p> <p>With a deep groan of pleasure, we broke apart. She looked down and said, "Oh!"</p> <p>"What?" I asked. How does that sound? "Is that OK?" I asked. It was. She laughed and said she'd be back in a moment. She went into the bedroom, but left the light on. I watched her work. She was back in a very short, tight, tight dress that showed off a lovely pair of legs. At her waist was the little black lace bra holding up the sheer, thin fabric of the dress. And, up the soft, lanky sides, a wide black belt with a matching bra, which showed the lacy sides of her breasts and showed the outline of her cleavage. Her black skirt was finished in a black, high-cut split. A pair of black high heels topped her outfit. And, she went back up to what she had in mind.</p> <p>I looked in the room, just as she had. "God, I'm horny!" I thought.</p> <p>"Did it make you feel sexy?" she asked rhetorically. Not only did it make me feel sexy, but to think, it made me feel like more that one person. With the thoughts of the past couple of weeks, I felt that feeling between my legs growing stronger.</p> <p>As I looked in the mirror, I was thinking: "I never knew it would turn me on so much."</p> <p>I couldn't get the idea that it did. I looked out the window and saw three cars out the front of the garage. "What is it?"</p> <p>Sondra replied, "They're parking out front of the office. If we stay, this office door won't open and the front of the building won't be visible to anyone who's not sitting by this window." She looked back at me, smiled and kissed me. "What do you think?"</p> <p>I leaned into her and kissed her, sliding my hands over her soft, roundness and caressing her, all the while, imagining where we were going, and what we were doing next.</p> <p>We finally made it to the doors, and opened them, not knowing if we'd be able to open them. We were both naked and she was standing there wearing only her boots, stockings and the tight thong beneath. Her face was flushedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
