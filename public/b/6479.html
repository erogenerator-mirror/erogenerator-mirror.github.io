It's hard to come to terms with it, but I do it because it's what I want to do. It's been on my mind for a long time, and I've gotten used to it. I guess that makes me special."</p> <p>Now it just slipped out again. "Yeah, I guess it is. So tell me about this guy."</p> <p>"I guess it just came with a pretty big price," he said. He had to admit it wasn't a huge shock to his system at all. The guy was quite attractive, from what she had told me on the phone.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" she asked, then added, "Maybe it would've been better if I said that first."</p> <p>"I don't want to make you uncomfortable, but I wouldn't want to embarrass you."</p> <p>"No, I wouldn't, but I am a little nervous about it."</p> <p>"A lot?"</p> <p>"Oh, yeah. I know it can't hurt my confidence. But if it does, I don't think I want to take advantage of my predicament."</p> <p>"Well, you seem to be. You seem very easy going, and I was thinking we could be friends."</p> <p>"Oh, right. I'm afraid I'm too big. Just do what you want for me. I'm not a complete wimp."</p> <p>"You aren't; you're just not what you're used to." He was sincere. There was that softness in his voice, and the fact that she had never really heard that side of him before. It turned her on as well. She looked up. "So there's no harm in asking a question like that?"</p> <p>"You mean you wouldn't mind us hanging out tonight?"</p> <p>"I never really thought there was," she admitted. "Maybe just the two of us."</p> <p>"We will, and that's not a problem." With that, he turned and walked toward the bar. "If you want to try this again, I'd like to see you again sometime this summer." He was still talking to her when she got up and joined him in the bar. "It might be fun."</p> <p>"Are you kidding me? I have had the best time. Even though I think I'm not as good as your buddy."</p> <p>"You seem awfully serious about going out. Have you changed your mind?"</p> <p>"No, I did want a little something in return." She smiled, and turned to head out the door. She had planned it this way, and it had all made sense to her.</p> <p>Tom and Marcella spent the next three days living together, enjoying various things and even experimenting with a little wine. They seemed to be doing pretty good as both of them got out of bed early each morning and went to their own beds in the evening. One morning, Tom was still sound asleep when she joined him in bed. The next thing she knew, in the middle of the night, he was having sex with her. She found the whole story very erotic, and as wonderful as it all made her sex-starved.</p> <p>Later that evening, when they had just finished their mutual fuck, he went out and purchased some condoms and a small enema kit. She was happy to find that they had also gotten him to perform a little early this morning, and she was happy enough to let him in the bathroom to clean up. They went and had a glass of scotch with strawberries and champagne, then went back to bed.</p> <p>"I need to tell you something, Tommy. It's kind of personal. It's a new situation. I felt like I was being used, and I need to know more about it."</p> <p>"That's the problem. You said it was personal. It is too personal to just hang out on the Internet for me. What's the difference, if you want to try something else?"</p> <p>"Can you help?"</p> <p>"Of course! I've always been a little apprehensive about talking to people about these kinds of things. This thing about going to the ladies room has been a little weird to me lately. I've been too nervous around myself to say anything to anybody. But I can help. Now it's up to you."</p> <p>Tom just nodded, not knowing where to begin. "This is so weird."</p> <p>"Do you really not like it?"</p> <p>"Of course not, I don't know the first thing about it. But I really like being used like this."</p> <p>"Well, the truth."</p> <p>Marcella got up and took her lover to the bathroom, where she stood before him and kissed him. "I know I shouldn't have done this," she said, "but I really want to. I mean, all this is kind of awkward, with how much I'm comfortableâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
