Am I doing the right thing?"</p> <p>"You're doing the right thing; you know I'll do my best to please you."</p> <p>"I don't really know, but if you keep doing this, I will find out what it feels like to have my cock in a woman's mouth."</p> <p>"I might have to try it," she said, giving me a seductive smile. "Oh, maybe I'll have to just stay here and think about it."</p> <p>The next day at school, Jessica and I played volleyball. We both ended up winning five of our matches. I was so focused and so focused on being the best I could; that Jessica never let up on her teasing. We sat around for the rest of summer, just hanging out at her house, and she still teased me about how sexy she was, and how she felt in bed with me when I made love to her, and all in good fun.</p> <p>The end of the year came, and when we saw each other again, with some of her more recent experiences, we ended up fucking our brains out on the sofa right in front of her as we started taking a few minutes to ourselves. Our tongues met over and over and when we broke apart to wipe our faces, I bent and started planting a kiss on her lips.</p> <p>At home that night, we made out all night. Every time I slid my hand up her body and started to feel her nipples through the thin material, she seemed incredibly horny. When I slid down to try to kiss her clit or to get between her legs, she was going to stop me. She did this about a half dozen times after that. I guess I was starting to see why she liked teasing me. After the night we had, sex with Jessica got easier to describe by my brain; and it got better and better too. We had a few more sexual sessions with each other and just like that night we were finally going to get together one day, the best of both worlds.</p> <p>The end of the year, and the start of summer semester, arrived just a couple of weeks after we had both graduated. Our parents had left us in charge of keeping house, so we were going to be alone when we got back to school. We had a pretty easy relationship going back into the days when my parents would take me to lunch or go to the movies. Jessica was going by "Brie" almost every day. We were going out to lunch in the parking lot one day when she was leaving. She knew exactly where we lived, just as I knew mine. That day we sat in the back of one of her mom's cars. She was smiling as she smiled back at me, and I swear, her mother, if she were mine, she might have just flashed that smile of hers across their faces. It was so clear that everything in Jessica was perfectly normal and perfectly in love with her that day. Jessica was one of my best friends, and if her mom thought she had done something wrong or messed up, then her parents knew for sure that whatever was going on between them was just between her and me. I don't know if anyone has ever told me that a single person had given anything back to Jessica, and if I did, and it is true, neither of us could have done anything differently. Jessica and I are now the "one and only" couple in our lives. The fact that Jessica is a woman doesn't mean that nothing has changed between us. What does it mean to see her as a person that you can trust again to do this with?</p> <p>One day at school we all arrived back at the house, and when we arrived, we walked into the kitchen just in time to hear the clatter of plastic and the clink of bells as Jessica's mom put her little girls back in their proper place. I went through all the necessary things that they would need to do in order to get Jessica to do what she did this time. We had the best of all worlds as her mom looked through the refrigerator, making sure that everything was all there.</p> <p>"Good morning, sweetie," she said, "this might be a bit big for me, but we'll go as it should be. Did you want something to eat?"</p> <p>"No," I said, "I was going to go grab some lunch for myself. I'll call a friend who's in town that would be perfect for us."</p> <p>Jessica nodded and we went to the refrigerator and started off toward the food pantry. She got dressed and looked in the refrigerator. "What?" I said, "I'm already here."</p> <p>"Well," she said, "I don't really know if it is a good idea to open up all of this stuff and get it to you, but we can'tâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
