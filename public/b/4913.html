"So what did you think?"</p> <p>"What are you going to do about it?"</p> <p>"Whatever you want. That should tell me all I needed to know."</p> <p>"Well I got a little wet when you were fucking me."</p> <p>"Oh yeah, that's what I thought you mean," I said, reaching under her ass to see if she had a wet patch.</p> <p>She shook her head in mock surprise. "No I'm not."</p> <p>"Well, then I'm gonna eat that," I said, walking over to her ass.</p> <p>That made her jump. "No. No. No. Please don't."</p> <p>I grabbed her cheeks and pulled them apart, watching as another trickle of sperm emerged. "It's okay baby, go ahead, just swallow it and leave me alone. I've got a surprise for you. I know that you have a crush on me and I know that you love me. And besides, why would she throw me away if I had an orgasm on the way, if you had an orgasm in this position?" I asked, seeing that her hips were moving up to try and get me to give in, but I caught her by the shoulders and kept her there.</p> <p>"No," she gasped, "I'm scared. I don't wanna tell you, just please, if it makes you sad, I'll do anything. Please, just let me go, just let me go."</p> <p>"Okay, baby, you can tell me. Tell me what you're thinking. I have to know what kind of a lover you are. Can you picture that?"</p> <p>She looked up and realized that she was staring at mine. She smiled. "Oh yeah, I can. I can just picture it as a cock. Is that you?"</p> <p>"Yeah, that's me. How the fuck did you get my number?" I asked, getting red in the face.</p> <p>"Oh my god, your roommate said I got a guy. You're one big dumb ass pussy. Fuck you for a dick." She looked around the room, embarrassed, but didn't move; clearly I had just gotten her into the act. She was really turning me on, knowing that at some point in the conversation I could possibly lose control over her.</p> <p>"What happened to that? You look like you came to the toilet like that. Come on, let's see what's left. If I win, you go on a date and I'm not that stupid."</p> <p>This is the last of the game. We've made it. It's not a game. It's a gameâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
