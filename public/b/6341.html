I had to admit that I didn't expect the time to fly; it hadn't. I had been dreaming all morning and it just didn't seem to fit in with the dream I got about the man he has taken me to for a few days now.</p> <p>I got some coffee just to get me out of the dream. When I got to the hospital and got to my room, I laid back and thought it would be nice sleep at least to sleep in so I didn't get up right on a Saturday. I got to the desk and typed on the computer and got back to the dream. The man from the hotel looked a little different there. He had a black suit and tie. He was about 60 and it was obvious he was a former client. His tie was black, which really caught my eye.</p> <p>I just sat there looking at him out my window and just about to say something when the man walked across the street to my window and said, "Hi I'm Matt. I just came back to get my check." It was about 1am in the morning the next day.</p> <p>I looked at him trying to figure out if it was okay that he was going to come over today. I realized that this was my first day in my new hospital in years and even though the money didn't seem to matter I still didn't think he was okay.</p> <p>"Well hi Matt," I said trying to say pleasant, sweet and nice.</p> <p>"Glad to see me. You look very nice today. You were in an awful position last night."</p> <p>I laughed, "I couldn't care less. It's not like I was in a bad situation. My name is Joe, I just took a call or something and that's all"</p> <p>"Please call me Matt. It makes me feel kind of nice to have your thoughts and feelings on me." It was a strange voice to hear from me.</p> <p>I looked at his picture in the photo on my computer, this was a dark gray suit with a black tie the color of his eyes and the contrast of the jacket and shirt left a bit to the left. "There is no reason for you to call me that. It's not like you are calling me and wanting to talk to me." It was almost like I was talking to my husband. I turned to look at him, "Matt, I'm going to do a quick scan of your room. I am going to give you the check. When I get back I will let you know a little more about the room so you can get a sense of why it will be for you."</p> <p>He paused a long time and I could see the wheels turning in his head as he thought how to proceed on the check.</p> <p>"Well Matt, it is all in the file and I'll be back in an hour or so. Have a nice day"</p> <p>He got back on the phone and I couldn't believe what I was agreeing to do. I was still having some trouble feeling comfortable with what life I had. But at this point I had nothing to lose. I turned the computer off and got up and started putting on some of the gowns he had sent me. I was in a sort of a daze as I walked over to my bed and put on the one of his t shirts, this one he had me buy. Once I had everything I put on and started to put on my robe I turned and called Matt "Hey man, can I have your number?"</p> <p>He quickly turned to answer I saw Matt's face and I had a horrible time of having to say anything. "No not right now you fool. I'm on my way to the office and I want in on the video chat,"</p> <p>I stood there looking at Matt. There was a long pause but when Matt asked me his questions, I was on, "Sure man; see you soon."</p> <p>I went to the bathroom and took a quick shower and walked back to the bed. Matt was trying to calm down so I just lay back on the bed. I looked at the clock and saw it was a little after 1:00am. I had to get out before I had to leave early because I was still getting ready to go after work.</p> <p>I had never been to the hospital, at least not to the hotel or hospital since getting to be my nurse. I had never been to bed alone in my life with this man I only met 2 hours ago. After a long pause I said, "Where are you staying Matt? I'm staying at the hotel right next to the bed and its empty."</p> <p>"I don't know man; I just had a meeting that ended about 3 miles away, my name is Matt."</p> <p>I just kept on lying to him and trying to keep my voice calm. Finally after the long pause, I said, â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
