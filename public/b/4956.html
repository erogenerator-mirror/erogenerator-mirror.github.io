After all this time I never realized what an asshole I was and the last thing I wanted to do was have my dad do that. He knew it too! He knew it from the first night he'd come out to my room and told me how stupid I was being and what a loser I was and why I'd always wanted him but never got the chance and never had he been able to be such an asshole.</p> <p>Of course, I knew I could get into such big trouble, especially with the way I felt about the relationship we had. The only thing that kept getting me to go out was his constant presence in my life, always being around me and never being around me very much. Of course, I loved him and thought that was enough, but if anything bothered me I couldn't help it because he was my daddy and I was his daughter. Of course, when he wasn't around I was the one thinking what I was doing with him. The only problem was I was never going to get it, and every time I tried to make it happen, it was always going to be with the only dad I would ever have. That is, until he left me for me.</p> <p>He was everything and more to me as he used to be and no one had even approached me sexually before. Not once but just when he came home drunk and then was so drunk he couldn't stand to have any sex and when he couldn't take a piss without being reminded for sure, he left my room when he finished. I guess all this was the way I was always going to figure it out or not. If he wasn't his father I'd probably just move out and never have to find him again.</p> <p>The only thing that kept me going for the rest of college was coming home and making sure I had everything I needed in living color and was dressed properly. Of course, every other time I went out I dressed extra nice. I wore really short dresses and high heel shoes all the time and wore baggy T-shirts with no bra, so everyone knew I had some extra weight! And of course, my hair was a complete mess and every time I had a new dress that didn't have that damn bra hanging out. This was probably the first time he was wearing any clothing and I swear it wasn't even his.</p> <p>When he got home from work I could tell he was just about as nervous as he was. We were almost like we were going out. When we came home I was sure I was going to be seen by everyone in our class and even worse, by the teacher when he saw how nervous I must have been, especially since I always wore my little skirt and high heel shoes. Of course, he even managed to catch me doing that, but it just went un-noticed that he was actually seeing and taking a picture of my legs as I put on my panties.</p> <p>It was kind of surreal to be a teenager and have such a nice guy in your room watching you walk around you that way, especially when I could almost feel his eyes all the way up my legs to my pussy. Of course, it always made me so happy too. I knew that as soon as he got home I'd give him a nice hot flash as we kissed and he'd do all kinds of things and I'd even suck him when we were alone and then all he'd do is lick my pussy before we go to sleep. Of course, I never even let him touch my breasts and never went anywhere else for that matter. Of course, I had a lot of girlfriends for boyfriends that I wanted to sleep with but they were all too busy with studies and relationships with parents who were always away from us.</p> <p>Of course, that always ended with us having sex but not too often and he always made sure to save it the best for me when I really needed it. Of course, he would get a photo of my legs or my panties in his hand as he licked me. And while there was no way I could ever put my panties right back on and show his parents my naked pussy I did try. Once while he was cleaning up his homework I had to go take them off for him and he'd just kind of walk away and never say a word. Of course, all of which I did end up wearing in front of everyone in class.</p> <p>After the first year of college I spent a lot of time thinking about what I was going to do when I got home from work. Of course, I got to know some of my new friends more and I did notice that John had a lot of friends from work that always seemed to be in town. Of course, that had always been on his mind because he was always at home all week long. It was also interesting to me to notice he had a lot of work to do. After all, one of the things most people don't do is work.</p> <p>Of courseâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
