I could...ah," I let her go on about it and then said, "maybe tomorrow morning."</p> <p>"It depends...where you work it...it depends, you know,"</p> <p>"Oh?" I asked, "what would I do without you?"</p> <p>"I could come by you, you know...you know, you know...and...you could stay here...that could be great...you know...maybe hang out with me again sometime...it's a little...naughty," she said to me, looking at me as I finished the sentence.</p> <p>"I'd like that," I said to her.</p> <p>"It'd be so great to have you here tomorrow...after the kids are gone...you know," she said to me.</p> <p>"Yeah, right," I said to her as I hung up the phone and looked over to her for my phone and said, "I could maybe make it up to you if you'd give me your number...I might even have dinner for two with you," I said to her.</p> <p>"That really would be great," she said to me.</p> <p>"I'm just saying...maybe make you dinner...if you could make something special with me!" I said to her.</p> <p>"I could help you figure that one out....but would you like me to bring you to dinner tonight?" she said to me.</p> <p>"Sure that'd be fun, we could make out right there on the beach...I've got some things planned and..." I said to her.</p> <p>"You'll just have to see for yourself," she said to me.</p> <p>"I got to be going," I said to her.</p> <p>"I'll call you tomorrow to figure out the time, okay?" she said back to me.</p> <p>"Sure, I'll call you tomorrow," I answered to her.</p> <p>"I just hope that doesn't be too early...." she said to me before hanging up and then turning toward me and said, "you know I love you."</p> <p>"I love you too, sweetheart," I said to her as we stood on each floor hugging each other as I carried my suitcase into our room.</p> <p>"I don't remember calling you earlier," she said to me as I carried the overnight bag in from the car. "Would you like to come out with me tomorrow? Maybe dinner with me?" she asked me.</p> <p>"Sure that'd be great," I replied, not really meaning it to.</p> <p>"Oh, uh...my husband is...well, I might have something to do...like, that if he can't make it for me," she said to me.</p> <p>"I'll pick you up around seven...wouldn't that be a treat," I said to her as she watched my face and then said, "if you could make it later..."</p> <p>"Sure, um...maybe..." I said to her before hanging up.</p> <p>"Would the kids sleep over...at night?" she asked me.</p> <p>"Sure," I replied, "unless I'm tired or something."</p> <p>"No you're not," she assured me as we left the elevator and she walked to the door but I grabbed her arm and pulled her toward my apartment.</p> <p>"Wait, you're tired, I'm just hungry and can't seem to get my food..." I said to her with a laugh.</p> <p>"Okay..." she answered him.</p> <p>As I unlocked and opened the door, I grabbed her and pulled her into my apartment just behind me as I pushed the door open and she stepped forward into the living room.</p> <p>"Do you see any candles that I could use...would you like to light them for me?" I asked her as I held the door open.</p> <p>"Yeah...you mean, would you like to join me...y'know, take a shower...before dinner?"</p> <p>"Sure....I guess so," I replied as I led her into the kitchen.</p> <p>"This is getting kinda annoying since it's going to rain tonight, so we should go to bed... I know the kids won't mind if we get up early anyway," she said to me as she sat at the table.</p> <p>"Sureâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
