I asked her.</p> <p>"I don't mind it, John," she said.</p> <p>"Me either," I continued. "I think about fucking you."</p> <p>"Don't get me wrong!" she laughed. "Don't you think we should get to know each other better?"</p> <p>"Well, we don't have to get to know each other, but you're right!" I laughed again.</p> <p>"That's what I like to hear," she said.</p> <p>"How about in our bed?" I proposed.</p> <p>"Yes," she said.</p> <p>"Okay," I agreed.</p> <p>Chapter Three - The Day After Christmas</p> <p>After breakfast I had to go to the office, I told the boss that I had to make my way home, and I would see him around eight that evening if he needed anything. I also offered Sam a ride to see her mother.</p> <p>By eight I got into the truck and headed for home. I wanted to be alone with my wife, and I didn't want to be alone with John. The drive was fairly short.</p> <p>"Hello," I said, as I pulled up.</p> <p>"Hi honey," she said. "Where's your mom?"</p> <p>"I got out of the truck and was about to get in the house when I was stopped," I said. "Where you mean? You got home?"</p> <p>"My mom's not home right now," she said. "I got back," she said, turning to look over at me. I was looking her over at the waist and the top of her skirt and she looked incredible. Her hair was wet and hanging down around her shoulders, almost to her waist.</p> <p>"Yeah, mom's home," I said.</p> <p>"Really?" she asked me. "Is that right?"</p> <p>"Yeah," of course I was, and truthfully I was too, at this point. "But I didn't finish getting out of the truck. My sister got home a little while ago and we were running late," I said. "She said there was something wrong with the bed and I couldn't sleep or play with her. She thought there was something wrong?"</p> <p>"Oh, honey," she said. "You don't have to do this if you don't want to. We can just forget it. It's all right, you know."</p> <p>"No," I agreed. "That's not true! I don't want to do this!"</p> <p>"Well, there is nothing wrong with what we're doing, it doesn't have anything to do with it. You're the one fucking my daughter, and I'm fucking your best friend!"</p> <p>"Really?" I said. "That's all you want?"</p> <p>"Oh, you could say that. I love you, so don't worry. She's your best friend, so don't let her get away." She paused and looked back at me, and then back to the road ahead. "This is Sam, my best friend."</p> <p>I nodded my head. "Yes. I'm John."</p> <p>"I guess that makes me a best friend too?"</p> <p>"Yes," I said. "I'm Sam."</p> <p>"And you're my father!" she said.</p> <p>"I know. I've been there," I said.</p> <p>"Yes, dad. I know."</p> <p>She smiled at me and I thought what a great kid and a great mother I had. She looked so much like her daughter. I looked around, and I thought I saw Sam's mother, sitting in the front seat. She wasn't there, but what was she? When I looked farther I saw some lights on and the headlights were coming up.</p> <p>I thought she would have gone back home and got in bed, but she didn't and I saw that she was lying on her side on the far side of the car. What the hell could possibly have happened? She was still on her stomach and the bottom of her skirt was up around her waist. I could see some of her hair sticking to the side of the car as she lay there.</p> <p>"Hi sweetheart," John said.</p> <p>"Hello dad," she said, grinning. "I was just getting ready to go to bed," she said, rolling over on her stomach again and pointing her head at me again.</p> <p>As I looked I saw the front of Sam's mother's skirt raising above her knees. I was frozen a moment staring at her back, but I think she felt my stare.</p> <p>"Oh my!" she said. "No wonder they had the lights on!
