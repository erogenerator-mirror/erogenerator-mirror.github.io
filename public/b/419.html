"I thought we had come to this?"</p> <p>"Oh, we have, baby, but I have a lot on my mind," I told her. "We need to have a little talk before we go any further."</p> <p>"Talk? Are we going to have a little talk?"</p> <p>"No! What do you want?"</p> <p>"Oh, don't bother with that, I just want to know what you want. I don't want to feel that I have to ask what you really want, and to make it go away. What you really want is to come home with me and be with the man who has the best sex you've ever had," I told her.</p> <p>"Well, I've got nothing to fear from anyone. You're safe in your own home," she told me with a smile. At that point, I decided I had to be the one to tell her about her husband. Even though she had only a few hours before she had to leave to go meet his family at the airport, I would wait until it was time for her and then talk to her about it.</p> <p>"Oh, I was wondering the same thing," I told her. "It's so hard for me to do the things I like to do with my husband. So, I want you to be happy because you're with us, and so will you be happy because we are with you."</p> <p>"That's nice, but what could I be happy about? I have to have my share of a nice man," she teased me.</p> <p>"I'm not like you. I do have a friend that wants me so be happy that I'll be happy until the day you get married," I told her.</p> <p>"Oh, I wish I could go without you for a year! It's the happiest time ever," she told me with a big smile. "It will only be a few months, but the things I've heard about it have really taken an impact. It will make you happy, and we'll be together for ever," I told her.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sure it won't be long," she said, trying to make it up to me and my friend. "It's nice to know I can always use you around the house, and that the only thing that will ever change that is for you and me to know that," she told me.</p> <p>"You're sure that's all right, baby," I assured her. "It's not just just your marriage. I'm sure that you'll be happy and be satisfied," I told her.</p> <p>"Well," she paused. "As soon as I get back to the city, I'll call up to see your uncle, and tell him that my uncle's a special lady."</p> <p>"Yeah, he's quite a lady himself, and you're on your own for right now," I answered, happy enough to keep her smiling. "I can't have you going to any places without my permission, because I don't want you to be a danger to your uncle, and I know that if the police find anything, they'll want to know where I am," I told her.</p> <p>"Well, if you're going to do it, at least let it be in your home state," she told me.</p> <p>I told her I thought that I could deal with that if she wanted me to. If she wanted some company and I had someone in mind, she'd better do it. Once more, I told her that I was only joking, but I trusted the woman to be as honest and upfront as possible. I told her that it would help to have someone to talk to about anything, so that I could understand what was going through her mind, and to not have to see any of her crazy relatives.</p> <p>"That's great," she said. "I want to come back to you when I think about it."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sure, baby, that can be arranged," I reassured her.</p> <p>That evening I told my friend Mike that I would see him that next weekend. He'd told me the same thing; that the new house would be bigger than before too, and that he'd be looking into looking at other properties, and would certainly be a real hit for me.</p> <p>The next Saturday evening, I had a lot of things to do: the house was still in the shape it should have been: a large but tasteful addition of white trim and black furniture was complete, a large stone fireplace was set to the right and the new master bath was the best in the area. The new kitchen was perfect, and the pool and hot tub were the greatest features that I could imagine.</p> <p>I had a lot of thoughts going through my mind, and I spent the next several hours having fun.
