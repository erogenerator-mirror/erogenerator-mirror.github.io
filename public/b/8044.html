I knew that Susan’s husband might not be home for dinner anytime soon; I needed to clear my head.</p> <p>When I finally came back to the bedroom, I found a note on the table:</p> <p>“John?”</p> <p>I scrolled through the list of messages and realized that she had been in the shower all day. At least until she was going through the list.</p> <p>“Goodnight Baby. I’ll be home around 6 o’clock.” Susan stated with a devious smile.</p> <p>I could feel my heart thumping against my rib cage as I waited for Susan to finish her shower. I couldn’t wait to go out to dinner with her but my mind was on what she might be thinking.</p> <p>When I got home the evening before it was just after 7pm and her apartment was empty. I didn’t look much of a hit so I didn’t bother closing the door and headed to the liquor store. After I purchased a bottle of red which I had bought at the drive-in, I turned my attention to the bed where Susan had given the whole thing away. I took in the whole room and the bed. I could feel a twinge of fear, a small nudge against my dick as I realized what she had told me.</p> <p>After I had had a drink I climbed the stairs before heading into her bedroom. I closed the door behind me and leaned against the top of the door. I was afraid that she might say something, say that she didn’t want me there, but she didn’t.</p> <p>“What do you want me to do?” I asked.</p> <p>“Take everything off, then lie on the bed.” She added.</p> <p>I had no idea why I was so afraid but I undressed and started to stand up.</p> <p>“Stop. Don’t get on the bed until I tell you to.” She stated.</p> <p>I didn’t think that I was going to get any response from her which I hoped would be just that; she wouldn’t say anything that she didn’t want to say.</p> <p>I lay on the bed while Susan pulled the sheet up with a grin. When she got on the bed, she didn’t say anything. She snuggled up to me like I had been asleep and her hand drifted down to my dick. I felt my heart jump into my throat, my stomach flutter, and my heart was so excited that I thought it might explode. My heart was pounding, but not from fear.</p> <p>“It’s so nice to see you John, I love you so much for letting me stay by your side this day.</p> <p>I was sure that I would be dreaming; my fear that she might even tell my parents or get even more information about me from Susan’s sister. That wouldn’t do, not after what I had done. The only thing left to do was ask for help, or something!</p> <p>“Hush.” She began, “I had to see you, and for that you were welcomed.”</p> <p>I tried to listen to her but could hear the panic in her voice. I felt her hand rub up and down my shaft until my dick was stiffer than it had ever felt in my life. I tried to speak, to reason that I might be dreaming but nothing came out to me at that point. Her hand cupped my balls and she squeezed them gently while she leaned down to kiss me. I held out the opportunity to push hers away, to kiss her, to touch her, to touch her. I could feel the passion building in her body as she pressed her body against mine. My heart raced as she rubbed my dick, the hot contact sending a wave of warmth through my entire body. I felt my own body respond to hers as we touched more intimately and we kissed more passionately. The wet patch between her legs became a wet streak. I felt the wetness spread over my pelvis, my leg muscles began to shake, and my dick began to throb.</p> <p>“Oh God!” I think I screamed as I felt as if I were in a car wreck. I felt like some kind of animal had come in with a mission and I was a dead man. I felt every muscle in my body tense as I tried desperately to pull back from her touch. I tried to fight it but her hand had only driven me over the edge at that point. My body was shuddering, shaking, and shuddering. I felt like a deer was trying to hide in the dark while I could feel the warmth of her body. I felt like—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
