They repeated their motion for a few moments each time a little longer, before she let out a little growl.</p> <p>She pulled back and looked up at me, "Well, you're not allowed to do anything right now, I don't even need to ask you if you want to suck or blow in order to fuck. I'm going to have to teach you this, so if you want to I think you could do whatever I say. I mean, what does it look like?"</p> <p>I couldn't help but grin, "Alright, let me see what I can do then," I agreed, still not sure how quickly I could recover from this. She had me there.</p> <p>Kyla got up and sat down in my lap, before pulling me in tight. She kissed me and ran her fingertips lightly over my chest, "I'm so horny right now I could get a horse in a skirt and do all kinds of things. But I think I should do something, and when I'm done you might get your pussy back."</p> <p>I could barely reply, she sounded excited. As she kissed me I felt the head of my cock press against what she called her 'pussy.' I'd have to admit it, Kyla made it a little worse if she'd just gotten it hard. But then she was already getting it hard, I started to say something, but Kyla's lip pulled me back down until my cock went all the way into her mouth. I gasped, my cock went deeper.</p> <p>Kyla didn't let up, I kept thinking she was going to let me fuck her, I was going to enjoy this, but that was just not going to happen. Before she did anything more to me she pushed her mouth against mine and kissed me hard. She then ran her tongue over mine to add some spice. I'm not sure what it was, but I didn't think I was kissing Kyla for sexual pleasure this time. If it was good it was great. But as I said earlier, the combination was more than worth the effort, the taste of her lips to me, and her soft flesh to me had me ready.</p> <p>She felt me harden and move her mouth slightly, she moaned against my lips as I pushed into her. I pushed, she sucked with her lips and my cock. She took me all the way inside, stopping for gasps of my own before she sucked me fully back into her mouth, her hand going to one of my boobs, squeezing it and rolling my nipple between thumb and forefinger. She was working hard at making me come, the combination alone was driving me to want more, to want more, to crave more. Kyla had me by now, and in a couple seconds I was going to tell her if I didn't stop, but I pulled her up and she got up on the couch before I would, straddling me and facing her. I wrapped my arms around her and pulled her close and kissed her deeply, trying to kiss her all over too.</p> <p>With one hand she grabbed the back of my head and I felt the softness of her back against my chest for the first time. I moved away to take a moment while my mouth stayed glued to her. With her arms above her head she was the perfect height for my cock, I leaned her backwards and took on of them, the difference of feeling her tits against me and sliding my cock between her legs as we kissed was almost perfect. The combination of that and the feel to my cock made her body melt against me. She started kissing my neck and I heard her moaning as her mouth met mine.</p> <p>With one of her hands she reached around and grasped my dick and started to stroke it. I moved my hands to her shoulders and moved my hands down to her ass, cupping her soft cheeks I rubbed my fingers in the crack of her ass. She was breathing heavily now and I could tell she was close to an orgasm. I pushed her hard onto her back and she put her leg over mine allowing me further penetration in her pussy. I took my time, using all three of them, from her feet down before taking both, rubbing the other and letting go.</p> <p>With her legs up in the air her pussy felt like heaven, it felt like it was at least wet enough for me to slide in. I felt her body tighten as I got myself into her. She grabbed my head and pulled me harder against her lips as I kissed her. She moaned and pressed back into my face.</p> <p>"Oh, god," she breathed into my ear. I kept kissing her and she pressed her fingers into my hair, "Come on. Fuck me."</p> <p>For a girl who knew how to drive her lover insane with passion I was a little surprised.
