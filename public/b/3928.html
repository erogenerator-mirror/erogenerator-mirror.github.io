I laughed. "You know you're right. He's about ten years older than you, isn't he?" I smiled as I moved around the table to sit down next to him.</p> <p>"Hmmm, yes, your father's forty-four. It's been quite awhile. He was always so busy, I guess, and it had always made him feel young." His eyes darted from the coffee to my eyes. "You're older than he is."</p> <p>"I'm not sure how old he really is, so, if you do feel like having a drink or even a conversation, I'd like it to be formal. Are your father's sons?" I looked back at him from over my glasses.</p> <p>"Actually, yes, in fact, that's exactly what he'd like," he said, giving me a sly grin. He took it as an invitation and looked over at me from the counter. When he finished the first drink he drained the second. We sipped on our drinks. I was not having much of a choice but to accept it.</p> <p>"Is there anything else I can get you?" I smiled and got up to walk to the liquor cabinet. I returned with four packages of Scotch, an iced tea, a pack of gum, a large whisky and a half-bottle of water. The boys stopped moving to watch me. I handed one to him and he took the glass from me and set it down.</p> <p>"Thank you," I said and took a gulp of the water. With that I got back to the boys. I took one more sip, set my glass down next to my glasses and sat back down. With the Scotch in hand, I sipped again and gave a little wiggle.</p> <p>"I hope you like, don't you?" My son said. My hands were frozen in their positions. I took a deep breath. I looked to the boys for any sign of what I had to say.</p> <p>"Yes, I do. We like to enjoy ourselves to such a large extent that we're used to having our own lives. We're all grown up and we have to deal with the things we have to deal with together," I said. My eyes were focused on both of them and I waited for them to respond.</p> <p>"I do, Mom," said Michael. "We like to enjoy ourselves too and you're right ... we do."</p> <p>"Are you sure?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes. In fact, I told him about what happens when that is what I do and you did too!" My tone of voice was flattered and I could feel Michael's cock jump to life.</p> <p>"You don't have to do anything," he said but his face was expressionless. "I just hope that you'll enjoy yourself that much," said Michael. He held out his arms to me. I sat back to let him slip my dress on. It felt wonderful to be in his embrace and Michael just wanted to feel me all over again.</p> <p>We sat at the dining table in just our matching teddies. We were both wearing just a bra and panties and I felt both excited and pleased that my boy enjoyed wearing such a lovely set of feminine garments to me. We didn't speak a word during dinner and I didn't attempt to stop him.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>We had our drinks almost promptly and left the room shortly after the boys had left for their respective classes. We quickly got ourselves ready for the ride back to our house. We made quick work of our jackets and were at the airport in just under an hour. Michael paid the cashier while I collected our bags and was led out of the airport.</p> <p>Mom picked up the boys as they were walking into the airport and handed me some of their luggage. They had stopped walking and stared at me for a time, before nodding.</p> <p>"You've got to get back to your boy friends," Mom said with a grin. I felt proud to have them at our home and we had decided that we would not tell them. And I would just get rid of them.</p> <p>It was an hour before we could get to the house and I was nervous about getting to the house. I felt as though we were going to be a couple and a long time. But that wasn't to happen. Mom made a call on the intercom and I got the boys to move from their car to their new car in two cars. We had them drive a couple blocks in silence. Then we walked to the house.</p> <p>"I'll go and put your bags in the hall bathroom," Mom said as she walked back. She was carrying our bags and she held out a hand to help me.</p> <p>"Mommy, you're so beautiful." I took her hand in mine.
