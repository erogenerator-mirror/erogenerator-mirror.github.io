I whispered.</p> <p>I reached behind her to grasp the bra in one hand while she pulled down her t-shirt. I gently cupped her breast, my hand touching her flesh as I rubbed and rubbed together, rubbing the nipple in between my thumb and forefinger. My fingers felt the hard bud of her nipple against my palm as we rubbed and rubbed together.</p> <p>She removed her own t-shirt entirely and my hand slid to the naked flesh of her waist to caress lower and lower onto her buttock. The touch of her flesh was electric as she undid the belt on my jeans and slowly, seductively, pulled downward as she pulled my jeans and underwear to my ankles. My cock sprang free from its concealment as she let her hand stroke the length of it before returning to stroking the length of it.</p> <p>The feeling of her hand stroking my cock was a delicious feeling of forbidden excitement. She was right now, so was I – her caresses and the gentle brushing of my pubic hairs on her lips and on her legs were arousing me. She let her hand slide up and down the length of my erection and I let my hand slide down the length of her body until I rested my fingers on her bare flesh, just inside her panties. I felt the wetness between her legs as we stood there – a soft moaning sigh emanated from her lips.</p> <p>She pushed her panties to one side and I slipped my hand underneath her to stroke her outer labia. We stood there, naked for a second – my fingers still playing with her panties and I could smell the scent of her arousal as she brought her hand and fingers to her mouth and sucked me.</p> <p>'Oh God,' she breathed in my ear. 'Let's go into the other room, you can fuck me there.'</p> <p>I picked up the discarded clothes I had scattered on the floor, dressed and we were both naked again, the cool breeze of the late afternoon still washing away the sexual tension and sex.</p> <p>As we neared the doorway, we stood outside, kissing again.</p> <p>'We only live a few blocks away,' I whispered in her ear. 'Can I turn it down? You seem to love the air.'</p> <p>She looked a bit coy – clearly the idea was to give me as much pleasure as she was going to give me – but she let go of me as I took her hand and lead her back across to the bed. I kicked off my shoes and then, holding the back of the bed and lifting her with me, I helped her lay down on her back. She lay there for a moment, with the top of her head almost touching the headboard, then lay still – watching me as I knelt on the bed next to her.</p> <p>I lifted her legs and slid the bedcovers back so her legs were bent at the knees and my knees were level with her shoulders.</p> <p>I could see her hand reaching for me and stroking the length of my cock as I stood over her. She was still looking at me, not just looking, but letting me know she was aware that she was naked and that I was naked - what was wrong with this, I thought?</p> <p>'You don't mind if I do this, Chris?' she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper.</p> <p>'Oh, oh yes.' I murmured, kissing her.</p> <p>I slipped my hand out and slowly, slowly, slowly slid it down to her pussy.</p> <p>She moaned softly, and she parted the outer lips with her fingers and parted them further.</p> <p>She pushed her legs up a little and then sighed a little more deeply.</p> <p>I leaned down and took her nipple in my mouth, softly sucking on it, feeling the hardness press against my lips, causing me to move my tongue round.</p> <p>She ran her fingertip down the length of my cock and around my balls and her finger slid deep into me to the knuckle.</p> <p>My hips began a tentative rocking against the bed, and I could feel my climax approaching.</p> <p>'What about this?' I whispered.</p> <p>'What about it? What about it?' she murmured, her face close to mine. 'You don't mind, do you? I don't mind the thought of being fucked by someone else - especially someone as hot as you.'</p> <p>'No, of course not. It's ok. I'm not doing this as a fuck-and-run. There's a world of difference between a man & a woman. I'm not going to do it as a f-for the sex itself, although I do consider that my orgasm should be an equal to yours.'</p> <p>'Not at all, Chris. Do you want me to cum inside you? Are you ready for—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
