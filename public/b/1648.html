I heard myself say in a low voice.</p> <p>"Yes. Why?"</p> <p>"He speaks English. Are you sure you can speak English?"</p> <p>"He understands me!" She replied, giving me a sexy look. "He speaks English well!"</p> <p>"I can't speak Chinese!"</p> <p>I had never in my life seen her act so flirtatious before. She suddenly said that it sounded like she was asking about her Dad, a Chinese friend of hers from school. She quickly put down her pen. She was serious.</p> <p>"I like to listen to people," I said. "I like to listen to her! I'm really in no hurry."</p> <p>"No hurry? What do you hear?"</p> <p>"Well, you," I said. "You and your Dad seem to be in an odd kind of relationship. I could say the same for you. In college you could say the same thing."</p> <p>Suddenly she threw her purse and purse on a hanger, followed by her keys and wallet.</p> <p>"Okay. Thank you," she said and gave me a hug again. While hugging, she leaned her head on my shoulder. I held her gently until she calmed down.</p> <p>She smiled. "I'm really getting into this game," she said.</p> <p>I nodded. "I told you we need to talk," I said. "You are going to be spending the next few days with me in the city, and it will be an important time to be with me. We can discuss anything. It always seems to be your future."</p> <p>"Don't worry," she said. "This is going to be okay," She was really happy. "This is too much."</p> <p>"I just want you to be comfortable with me," I said. I put some money in my pocket.</p> <p>"I guess it is hard on you. I mean, you are my best friend."</p> <p>"I am always happy to be your friend," I answered. "I really feel comfortable talking with you. You are so much younger than me, you are so lovely. You have always seemed so special."</p> <p>She just nodded. "I know," she said. "My Mom and Dad are so supportive of me."</p> <p>She looked down at the money. "Oh," She said. I reached up and took her hand and squeezed it. It was warm and soft. "This is so nice," She said. "I've never felt so special. You are so loving! And now I know I could really be comfortable with you too. You just have made me feel so welcome here."</p> <p>"You've made me feel very welcome, really welcome!" She smiled. I thought she looked really sweet. "That's the fun part. You seem really excited to talk to me."</p> <p>"I'm excited! Oh, that makes me happy. I'd be happy to talk to you about all of this," she added with a sexy smile. I was really starting to like this girl. "I've really been waiting since I was in college for you to say that. I've dreamed about talking to you so much."</p> <p>"I want to hear about all of your friends and their families!"</p> <p>"I want to hear about most of their families too" she responded. I took a sip of wine.</p> <p>"My parents know my family. My mom's my Aunt, My Dad's my Uncle."</p> <p>"It sounds so exciting," she said.</p> <p>"You are going to grow up to be special," I replied. "But that's the fun part."</p> <p>Her eyes lit up. "Sounds great. I love you! And you too!"</p> <p>"What? Why? Why would anyone say that?" She asked.</p> <p>"Well, you're a smart young woman," I said. "And you can understand that I would not do anything foolish."</p> <p>"Oh?" She answered, smiling and taking a sip of wine.</p> <p>"It's nice to have grown up with a young man when he's around. When we were first married, we did have really good sex. We went after each other, we did everything together, and we used to do naughty things together."</p> <p>"You shouldn't have done that!" She said. "Your Dad would never do anything like that."</p> <p>"If my Dad would not have suggested it," I replied, "the idea would not have arisen." I leaned over to her and kissed her.</p> <p>"This might be different," I said. "I wish you would try it. I was thinking that I would go back a long time to high school. You never mentioned it once!"</p> <p>"Yes, I do," She said. "I want to know where I'm going to get my first real relationshipâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
