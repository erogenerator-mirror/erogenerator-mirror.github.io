It would take about a minute, but I could feel the heat of my body, I could feel the weight on the couch. The smell of sweat rose up on my skin. I turned my head slightly to give it a better look at my roommate. I could see her eyes were closed in pure contentment. Her body was so soft and I had trouble breathing. As I looked down, I could tell that she had removed her bra, leaving her firm tits completely nude. Her nipples, like small rosy colored erasers, stood up proudly.</p> <p>"Your ass is so beautiful, isn't it?" I managed to groan out from under my breath. Her breasts were completely exposed from the back of her dress, completely shaven except for tiny little freckles all over from her neck and her shoulders. I didn't need to be told twice. I grabbed my own dick and pulled it out of my pants, standing up while looking her over.</p> <p>"Oh, that's so nice." she whispered.</p> <p>I bent down and licked the tiny bit of skin between her earlobes and down her back. I looked her over again, seeing that I had an erection on my own, and the fabric of her dress was very thin. I ran my hands over her shoulders and down my own sides, enjoying the feeling of my chest rubbing against it and the feeling of her nipples rubbing and pushing against it. I kissed her shoulders and down her arms, stopping momentarily to let her arm straighten and grab my thigh.</p> <p>"Do you like that?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Mm hmm." she whispered. Her warm, tight body was a little too tight for comfort but the comfort of her arms and the sound of her voice were enough to tell me she didn't mind it much at all. I kissed the top of her head lightly.</p> <p>"Would you like me to lick it for you?" I asked her. It was a small talk, but in her excitement, it didn't seem to phase her as she was getting hot all over again. As her head sank back towards me, my tongue brushed her ear. "Mmm!"</p> <p>I slid down her neck with the tip of my tongue. Her skin felt so silky; I could smell and taste every inch of her. Her skin was so warm, inviting and intoxicating. It took everything I had and in doing so I got so hard that I was ready to explode. She felt it too, I could feel it. Her hands were on the back of my head, feeling the way I moved down her back.</p> <p>"Don't stop." she said as her body rocked back and forth. "Go for it, give me that load."</p> <p>I looked up into her smiling face. Just the look made me feel like she was giving me a second chance. That look of hope, of life, of happiness was there in her eyes. I licked her earlobe, flicking it with my tongue.</p> <p>"Yes. Yes!" she breathed out.</p> <p>I took my thumb and finger and opened her skin up just enough to reveal her swollen clit. The skin wasn't so thin that it was hiding in the folds of her pussy, but it had grown so large and hard that it still had the shapely texture that it seemed like it had grown from the softness of the skin itself. It was sticking out of the folds, standing proud and proud, begging to be licked. I gently lowered my head, licking the length of her pussy while caressing her clit with my thumb. "Oh, yes, more, yes, just there!" she whimpered. She was writhing on top of me. I could feel that she was close to climax. I moved her body back further than before with my face to her pussy, kissing the outer lips. Her scent was so intoxicating, so sweet and I could feel every inch of her pussy as my tongue rubbed her clit.</p> <p>"Oh Jesus!" she whimpered.</p> <p>I stuck my tongue deep in her pussy, licking her up and down, over and under, over and under again. I spread her lips open and ran my tongue over her clit, then over and over again. My own dick was rock hard again, poking up and out with each thrust of my tongue. I used my free hand to rub my shaft a little. I spread her lips wide and moved my tongue to her clit again. I flicked her clit a little faster this time, then slid it back and forth on my tongue. My own body shook in ecstasy as she screamed out again.</p> <p>"Oh God..." her voice was quivering like a fish out of water.</p> <p>I could feel theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
