Take it off, too."</p> <p>"Don't be in such a hurry to put it on."</p> <p>"But I want to."</p> <p>She pulled her bottoms down around her knees.</p> <p>"So you want to put it on! Come closer."</p> <p>She moved closer as they hugged each other. He felt his cock harden in his swim trunks as it pressed hard between them.</p> <p>Sandy felt him move to kiss her and she pulled away before her hand could do more than brush away.</p> <p>"If we run into anyone else we'll get in trouble," she warned.</p> <p>"We'll just have to be quick."</p> <p>"We can't be too quick."</p> <p>"We were out of time."</p> <p>"You're serious?"</p> <p>"Maybe a little."</p> <p>"Me too, but we'll only be around for a few minutes. I really want to make love to you."</p> <p>The beach had turned into a nude ballroom area, with a full spa and hot tub on the other side. Two waiters were standing just inside the door, waiting to open it for them and he had his arm around her, pulling her close.</p> <p>She had her hand on his hard cock, which was now fully erect.</p> <p>"Why don't we go back inside? You can watch the other couple while I help you put on your bikini. I'll keep watching."</p> <p>"I'm so horny you're hard."</p> <p>"I've got something much better."</p> <p>Dwayne was already on the edge of the deck when they walked down the front of the pool. They sat down on their chairs in the sunshine, both completely naked. Sondra felt even more liberated with each step, not to mention naked for a change.</p> <p>The waiters, their drinks ordered and snacks placed on two tables with three other couples, appeared on the stage and Sandy and Dwayne looked at them in surprise.</p> <p>The waiters' uniform was much more comfortable, though Sondra didn't even notice until now. It was sleeveless and very revealing. Dwayne was wearing trunks and suntan oil on his chest and shoulders and Sandy's, in hers. A sarong was slung below them which wrapped around their asses but in the front they were naked under it. The sarong was tied with strings with straps that ran across their bodies so it had little to cover their pubic area.</p> <p>The waiters' tanned bodies were completely out of place in the beach. When the sun began to go down behind their heads Sondra could see a lot more than she had expected before.</p> <p>"Oh my, I've never had that in front of me before."</p> <p>"So how did your husband swim?"</p> <p>"We're in a public pool. We can't be seen from the back by the other couple."</p> <p>Sondra's eyes widened in astonishment.</p> <p>"When did you find a pool with hot tubs?"</p> <p>"When we first moved in. It was in a hotel in a different place where I was staying."</p> <p>"Where is it there?"</p> <p>"It's on the other side of the compound. They offered it to us when we moved in and we decided to do it."</p> <p>She turned around to go into the house.</p> <p>"Sondra! Take over! You're next."</p> <p>Her mouth was hanging open as she moved past him onto the pool deck.</p> <p>Dwayne watched Sandy's long legs as she walked to where he was sitting and sat beside him. He reached out with one hand and began playing with the top of her bikini while her other hand stayed on his cock. The feel of their naked flesh together was driving him wild. His erection was straining against his trunks, feeling her large breasts against his chest and on his hands as he rubbed her clit.</p> <p>"What the hell are you doing?"</p> <p>"You want this to be private?"</p> <p>"Of course I want this to be private."</p> <p>He reached out slowly to run a finger up her side and her clit. Her legs parted automatically to let him. He looked up at her face and noticed she had a look of surprise on it.</p> <p>"What's wrong?"</p> <p>"It's different. He gets turned on when I touch him like this."</p> <p>Slowly, ever so slowly, gently, she pulled her lips apart, revealing the hard organ she had been hoping to see.</p> <p>"Oh, this feels hot."</p> <p>"Why don't you let me taste it?"</p> <p>He moved her legs a little further apart to let his hands slide over her hips and round her stomach, feeling every contour as he pulled her toward himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
