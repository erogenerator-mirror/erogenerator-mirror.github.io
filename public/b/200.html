She stared at me with her jaw clenched at the expression on my face.</p> <p>"Are you serious?"</p> <p>"Nope."</p> <p>"But, I can see that you're interested in me, right?" She asked.</p> <p>"That's right. How would you know that?" I replied.</p> <p>"Because I did look at your body while you were looking at me a few months ago." She said.</p> <p>I was now getting a funny feeling in my stomach. I felt that I might get the chance to get to know the person I had grown accustomed to. I was thinking what she looked like; my mind started to drift back to my first time with Victoria and I realized the fact that, for the first time, I was starting to feel attracted to another woman!</p> <p>I didn't let any words leave my mouth. I just gave her a dirty look, and then said "So,"</p> <p>"So?"</p> <p>"So what, you're interested in me." I replied, and I was hoping she meant it to be.</p> <p>"Why don't you come by tomorrow and do you want to bring me into the back yard so that I can see your body." She said, and I felt as if butterflies were now running through my stomach.</p> <p>"Are you asking me out on the chance?" I asked again. I wasn't sure if she would even say that, but I could be wrong if I was wrong. We were both looking for a great time, but if I don't say something tomorrow, I wonder what will happen.</p> <p>"Okay. But maybe we won't do anything, right?" She said with a smile.</p> <p>"If you were offering me a chance to touch you, I'd be honored. And if you were asking me out," I said, giving her the same look that made it clear that I was excited to see her naked body.</p> <p>"No promises," Victoria said as she stood up from the sofa and grabbed her bags. We went to the front door, where our car waited, and I grabbed my bag and then turned to Victoria and said "Wow, you're one gorgeous babe." She gave me the same look over and over again. I looked around to see if the neighbors might be still at their window. There weren't any cars around the house, and I thought I could hear a horn blowing. She smiled at me, and pulled up the hood of her car. She then slid into the passenger seat next to me and then I climbed into the driver's seat. She turned her car onto the highway, and I felt her hand grip the gear stick. "Drive," she said as she buckled up, and I turned to look at her.</p> <p>"I can't, I've got to get to school early tomorrow," she said.</p> <p>"But could you please?" I asked, still a little nervous. I wanted her to go ahead and make a move, so maybe this would help.</p> <p>"I'll get my bags," Victoria said, and then she drove off. "See you in the morning." she said, and went to get back into her car. She then turned to me and gave me a playful wink. "Are you interested in seeing me?" she said. I gave her a shy smile, but then nodded my head, and then drove home. I was a little nervous about where we were going to go the next time, and even more so about the next time. "I'm sorry," I said, "but tonight my friends are expecting me home. So I better not go before I've seen you." I then drove home with a nervous grin on my face. I guess I was being too forward, because both Victoria and the girl who taught me how to drive seemed to be looking at me from time to time.</p> <p>"How are you going to do that?" Victoria asked me the following Monday.</p> <p>"Bye," I replied. I told her the details of how I was going to do the whole thing behind the car, and then we went to bed.</p> <p>That afternoon, Victoria was walking into my house wearing just a robe, but it showed all of her body. I felt like I was a school boy, and Victoria didn't have to worry about getting dressed. She walked straight into my bedroom, and as soon as she closed the door, she looked right at me and smiled. "My friends aren't expecting me home until after seven. So you better get ready," Victoria said as she leaned down and kissed me on the cheek. She stood up and said "Bye, I should be home about six."</p> <p>I took a shower and then I got ready for school. The next day, I made sure to wear the same robe I had just given Victoria.
