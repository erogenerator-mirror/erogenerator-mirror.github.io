I've been on top and she's pulling my hair." She laughed and moved over on him, "We'll do that again."</p> <p>He laughed back, "I know we will. You'd better get your face down and suck my cock. I'm ready for you."</p> <p>She moved over to the end of the bed and lowered herself to him. He quickly moved himself up the bed as she lay down on top of him, "Fuck me," she grinned and moved her body so that his cock pushed into her and she was soon wet and ready for him. He moved slowly at first, enjoying the warmth he could feel in her. Eventually he worked himself into her and felt her moving herself down more of his length, "Oh yes," she gasped and he began to move his hips, meeting her as she came to rest on him. He started moving slowly to help her and they both lay there satisfied, for about half an hour they kissed and snuggled until dawn broke. Mark knew that he would be busy for a while, so he went down to the kitchen to put his phone away that evening, to check the time, and to make it ready when the phone rang on a Saturday morning. He thought that she sounded like she was going to call again, but didn't.</p> <p>After the phone call, Mark went and got himself something to eat, then made his way back to his room where he changed into his clothes and had the weekend at home he loved to be away from home for a while. He wasn't there for the weekend at all though. He spent some time watching the television until he felt he would explode, then he went back to bed and tried to sleep, as he always was when he went to sleep.</p> <p>Friday afternoon dawned bright and sunny, so Mark felt a little better knowing that he had nothing to be concerned about. He wasn't sure that he had really been thinking but he felt good and the new things were better for him than he had thought. He had decided to stay out for the first day of school at the office for the first time, and if necessary, be himself before starting to work there. He would return Monday if that was still the case, but on this day he was going to work on his computer, to do some extra tasks and so he should be home by eleven, that night.</p> <p>In the bedroom he found her lying on the bed. She smiled as he approached, and kissed him deeply, "Sleep well Master," she whispered as he climbed on the bed with her, "I loved yesterday and it was wonderful to you too."</p> <p>Mark smiled as he lowered himself down on her, "I've been thinking about today, you know the same things he has? We'll begin by teaching you about how oral sex is performed."</p> <p>She grinned and leaned her head to one side, "You know me already, so I can only assume that the lessons are all new to you. I'm really glad we can be your first teacher, especially after all we've had?"</p> <p>Mark kissed her softly, "My first love is to be yours, not my second until you get married. It's really quite rare in fact."</p> <p>She smiled and kissed him again, "I know, I was hoping you'd be happy to see me."</p> <p>He paused as he looked into her eyes, "Do you think so then?"</p> <p>She smiled and smiled, "Oh yes! You can tell me anything and I just know what to do, can't stop."</p> <p>He nodded his head and ran his hand over her, "You know I always like to be very direct with you, can I take the lead? "</p> <p>She grinned before kissing him again and she lay with her hands caressing him as he moved over her. She felt like warm butter. "Do you want to be on top of me again," she murmured.</p> <p>Mark nodded, as she moved herself to join him and he took her. He lifted her slowly off of him as he lifted her legs over his shoulders. He raised himself over her slowly and the feeling of him moving along her was electric. He felt her moving her hips up and down his length and he knew, without wordsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
