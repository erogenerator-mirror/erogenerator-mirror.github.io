I think you'd like to try everything."</p> <p>"I do love you," I said.</p> <p>"I love you too."</p> <p>"Is that what this is all about?"</p> <p>"No. We're not doing this again."</p> <p>"It doesn't have to hurt, but when it's going to..."</p> <p>"I don't have to change, Josh. I can make this happen now."</p> <p>It was only a few minutes later that our flight took off. The first place to try is in a country, and it doesn't have to be remote. It has to be near a large, green island. The plane landed at an almost leisurely pace to take off. It seems like about an hour passed before we arrived at the island. When the plane started descending, we checked out, including the cash for the food and drinks, and paid the tickets at the Gatekeeper. We left the airport without looking back.</p> <p>When we got back to Vegas, the next place to try is in another town and the next beach on the other side of the ocean. It's almost noon now and I am feeling a little tired. So I decided to call the casino and see if they had any ideas. We had a casino and they just sold tickets. It's not too far from the casinos in Nevada.</p> <p>We bought a prepaid Visa-like card at the counter and spent an hour checking, then we got a credit card that could also be used by Visa for the next month or so. The card allowed us to play slots while still paying for the first week. When we got to the casino, we went straight to the room and spent every day of the next month paying in full for the free ticket. Each day, we played, but on the third day, we spent everything we had on the slots. That's usually after the fourth day. And since the second day is after the third day, when we go home, we're still paying in full for the ticket.</p> <p>The third day, we got an offer to buy tickets to Disney World when the third day of the month. But since it was not a day off, it seems we had to use the night out to get tickets to the first place, and if we played again, we had to pay in full for the next two weeks. However, we still found room service at the next casino a little cheaper than we had at the one we were in. We bought ourselves a few extra rooms at the hotel, and we got the whole thing.</p> <p>We got to the third place about five hours before we expected to get away. There was not a place we weren't going to, but we went to the second place. We spent a lot more time going to the third place just to try and get in. We never got there before. We got to the third lot and found it was about five hours closer to the strip club, so we decided that we would go in together and maybe have a little fun, and it would not hurt. That is what we ended up getting us tickets to a private private island the day we got married. We also found a way to use our room while we were at the resort. This would be a whole new experience for me.</p> <p>We went in and went through the entire hotel with no problems at all. We looked around and didn't see anything that could be considered to be any fun, and if you think this is going to be fun, don't hold that in your mind. I just sat back and enjoyed the day, and I was pretty excited too. When we finally left, we had about fifteen minutes left, so we went to the casino.</p> <p>When we got to the casino, we checked in and went on our way. As we were checking in, the casino seemed a little more interesting than we thought. However, after I checked my balance, I noticed a big guy with an empty slot machine across the table from me. At the same time, the man was going through a series of buttons. "What's this?" I pointed to the empty slot machine. "This one," I pointed to the empty box, "is for your private life," I added. "And it will take the time to pay you the full amount, if you decide to use your credit card."</p> <p>"Are you sure about what you want," asked the man, "That I can pay for anything you buy?"</p> <p>"No, I'm perfectly capable of paying for anything you buy, but only if you ask me, and I don't think I trust you."</p> <p>"I would like to use my credit card, if I don't have to," the man said.</p> <p>"You'll have toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
