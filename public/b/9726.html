You should be so much stronger." She said with a smirk.</p> <p>"I think I understand." I replied. "Do you trust me, baby?"</p> <p>"Yes, baby." She replied with a smile. "I trust you so completely."</p> <p>She gently slid back onto the bench, sitting back on it, taking me with her. "Now let's start you off with a good fuck." She giggled as I positioned myself and slid into her.</p> <p>"Ow, that's so good." I groaned as I thrust myself back into her.</p> <p>"I know, I know." She whispered. "You really feel like you're going to be so happy when you're with me." She paused, then began to bounce up and down on me, slowly building up the pace. "Come for me, John. That's it. Don't hold back. Fuck your mother!" She continued to fuck me in that tight sheath.</p> <p>Her words did make me go faster. She started to really feel pretty good, almost like she was moving in circles as she bounced up and down on me. It felt like she was on the verge of losing herself, letting the orgasm take her over. But she still had ahold of me. I looked her in the eyes and saw her determination. She was enjoying it a lot, too.</p> <p>"Can we just relax for a little bit. Please?" she asked.</p> <p>"Of course." I replied.</p> <p>We leaned back and rested on the bench. "I don't want this to ever end." She said with a grin, then reached between us and took my dick into her mouth. A few gentle sucks, then she climbed off me. I sat there stunned.</p> <p>The girl had her body on top of my bed, her face buried in my crotch. She looked up at me, a smile on her face.</p> <p>"I want you to cum in her mouth," she said.</p> <p>I was still in shock. I knew this was wrong, but a second later, my body started to react. I began to thrust myself into her mouth as she slid her tongue on and off my dick. My hips started to move, my hands gripped at her hair. She closed her eyes and moaned slightly while she sucked on me. I felt my balls draw up close to the base of my dick as my legs started to shake.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum," I gasped.</p> <p>"Just do it," she moaned, putting both of her hands around my cock and stroking me while she continued to deep throat me.</p> <p>"Fuck!" I exclaimed. "I'm gonna cum. I can't."</p> <p>"Shhh," she whispered into my rod. "I know." She squeezed me hard, then released me with an audible pop. She looked up as she looked up at me, a bit embarrassed, now with a little cum stuck to her chin.</p> <p>"Oh, that was so hot. You should have taken a shower." She smiled at me.</p> <p>"I really want to." I replied.</p> <p>"Let me help you." She said as she climbed off me. Her body felt so warm and smooth, her nipples stood up at least six inches. Her breasts looked to be at least a C cup, and her areola looked like pencil erasers, the size of half my fingers. She grabbed the hair at my groin, and kissed me.</p> <p>"I have an even better idea." She said with a grin. "Let's get you back on the bed."</p> <p>She put her mouth above my erection and began to kiss it up and down. She slowly moved up my body, until her face was only inches from mine. We started with little kisses, then I lifted her by both hands and moved her back to the base of the bed. She put her legs over each side of my hips and I slipped my hands around her waist and lifted her up. She wrapped her legs around my waist, pulling me inside of her.</p> <p>I continued to slide inside her. We both moaned as our bodies met, slowly moving closer, taking our time. I kissed every inch of her.</p> <p>"Are you sure you're okay with this?" She asked me. She was moaning almost in a whisper.</p> <p>"Yes. I'm sure." I responded. "I'm really happy with you."</p> <p>"You're wonderful. I can't believe I'm hearing about you getting my husband." She said into my ear.</p> <p>"Yes. I'm a woman."</p> <p>"You seem like a really nice guy" she mused.</p> <p>"Is that a problem?"</p> <p>"No, nothing at all. You deserve a man, John."</p> <p>"You're really good at figuring out what Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
