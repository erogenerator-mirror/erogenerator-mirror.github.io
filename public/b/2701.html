"But it is not for you."</p> <p>"Really?" His eyebrows rose as he stared out the window.</p> <p>"Yes, really. I have found, in myself...I have found the power. I have found the connection."</p> <p>His eyes widened. He didn't need to ask if he wanted that. Or did he?</p> <p>I gave him a reassuring smile as I slipped my hand below his and, feeling the warmth of his fingers close to my arm, my eyes closed, I slid two fingers into his mouth, wetting them, and then pulling them out again.</p> <p>My voice was sharp when I said, "Is that...?"</p> <p>He nodded. "Yes. I did this."</p> <p>I didn't reply, but instead leaned into his lips, the palm of my hands lightly caressing the hair on his cheek as we kissed. I kissed him hard, pressing my breasts against his upper arms, my nipples hard on his skin. He whimpered slightly as my hands slid down his back, over his hips, down to his belly. He whimpered again as his hips bucked against mine, his mouth opening in lustful, wanton hunger. Our mouths were pressed against each other's, his hands in my hair and then slowly, gently, his fingers tightened in my hair, his breath coming in short, lust-laden grunts.</p> <p>"Oh god...oh god..." he muttered, kissing me more, as his cock pressed against my belly. He moaned into my mouth as my hand began to caress, tug and rub along his cock.</p> <p>"Do you want this, baby?" I whispered hotly.</p> <p>He nodded, his head leaned back against his pillow, his mouth open and his fingers digging into my hair. I felt his hands tightening in my hair, and when I raised my head and looked into his eyes, he was smiling. "Say it," I whispered huskily.</p> <p>"I want this, baby."</p> <p>I felt his hips buck, pressed against mine and then he was moaning as I pulled my face from his, licked around the corner of his mouth. In my mind's eye, a long, low growl erupted from deep in his chest, a long, rich moan that echoed and reverberated in my mind and body.</p> <p>"I want this," I told him.</p> <p>He nodded slowly. "I, I'm sure," he replied softly. "I think we both do."</p> <p>I lifted up, sliding my hand down his abs to his hips and slid up and over his thigh again. I could see in his eyes that he wanted this. He needed me. A wave of longing hit at me as I reached up and stroked the hair between his hands, my fingers brushing the skin of his lower arm and then his shoulder, back and up to his face. "Yes," I whispered, my lips against his jaw.</p> <p>"Say it, baby."</p> <p>I nodded and moved my hand up to cup his cheek as my lips pressed against his. "I want this," I said as my tongue brushed against his lips. "I want you."</p> <p>He looked at me as his hips thrust into me again, his eyes meeting mine. "Tell me what you want, Jason."</p> <p>"I want you." I gasped as our mouths met.</p> <p>My lips moved in a circle that sent a shiver through his body, a wave of heat that coursed through his body. "I want to...fuck you," I whispered, as I kissed him.</p> <p>"Fuck." He groaned, pressing into me again.</p> <p>"Yes," I hissed, my lips still brushing against him as I reached up, finding his lips under my teeth. I could feel the softness of his lips and tongue as it pushed against mine. "Tell me."</p> <p>He moaned, his breath caught in his throat. As he spoke, his hands pushed into my hair, lifting my head slightly, causing my mouth to slide against his lips again as my arms wrapped around him, my fingers slipping into his shirt and then around the top of his thigh. He kissed me back as his hips moved back and forth against my hand, his hips rising up against mine. "Cum for me, sweet thing," he whispered. "It does me good to hear you talk like this, baby."</p> <p>I sucked his bottom lip in my mouth. My body tingled and a tingle spread down my thighs from the base of my spine. I wanted him to feel good. I wanted to feel like he did to me. I wanted his hips to move wildly as he came inside me so deliciously. And I wanted to feel his cock as hotâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
