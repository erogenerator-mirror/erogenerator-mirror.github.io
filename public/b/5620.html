She had been with them for several years, and was quite good with them and their friends. She was also interested in her own sexuality at times, which she found extremely intriguing. To be honest, she had actually never thought of herself as being sexually attractive. Not really.</p> <p>They had come on to her some a little too strong, and now there was no going back. She was glad this was such a mutually beneficial opportunity for them, that she could allow herself to have some fun.</p> <p>She was sitting on the edge of the bed reading the book by the large window when it came to her. It was a short story by a woman with a few fetishes. She had had some good experiences in her time as an adventurer, and she loved the feel of the silk sheets. She really liked that feeling of being alone and free of all the inhibitions she had before. A fantasy came to her when she had played with herself a little while before.</p> <p>She took the book to one side and started reading. She felt a little more comfortable, and a little more relaxed, and relaxed, and quite comfortable with them. She knew what those sensations meant. And she knew.</p> <p>She got her first good look at them and was very impressed. The picture was of a very pretty and petite little girl, with smallish breasts and small pert nipples, with long blonde hair that hung down in a lovely pixie cut about her shoulders.</p> <p>She loved her long thick hair. It had really made her face a little more beautiful. She had not realized that before, but that night she had given herself a trim trim and she had put on a little more perfume. So a little perfume in fact. She wondered for a second if she really wanted to do this. She had already told her husband she sometimes would make a pass at him on a date. This was a date, and she knew he had always fancied her. She wanted to.</p> <p>Her fingers started to wander along her bare legs; slowly making the way up her thigh until it rested against her crotch. She could see the dampness slowly moving up and down and between her legs. She could actually picture herself in those heels and pantyhose and panties. She wondered how much longer she could wait before meeting the others.</p> <p>She was not wearing any panties, and had been waiting quite a while to be totally bare down there. She closed her eyes and let out a very quiet soft sigh. She felt good lying naked in her own small bed, with her legs open. She was feeling a little better with every passing moment. Just thinking about what they did that night. She had no idea how many of those she had felt there too.</p> <p>Her fingers made their way up her long slender body, along her stomach. She gently touched her breasts. Her nipples were very small. Her hands started to knead them again. She let them gently rub around her nipples, feeling and massaging them each time they went under the fabric of her bra. She felt them stiffen a bit, and a shiver of pleasure ran through her. Her hand had worked wonders. She wanted it to go on and on. To just rub her nipples. To rub her pussy, to just press the fingertips of her hand there to feel it. She found that she was a bit moist when she finally got to that part of her body, which felt as if it were already moist and ready.</p> <p>She felt a touch at her shoulder, and knew there was a guy in the apartment she was sitting on. He was touching her there. She almost felt embarrassed, just letting herself go. She felt a sense of security when it came to her, of knowing that nobody she knew had heard her being quite so loud right then. It was an incredible rush right to know that a person in her situation needed no attention and that it could not be very good when you were having those reactions to it. It was just so very arousing to feel herself responding just a bit to someone's presence. Maybe she would just do it again.</p> <p>She knew this was a fantasy, too. Of course, it shouldn't be. This was probably only fantasy, to be so, but she could feel things like she had the night before, right there at the beach, at that moment of moment, where everything just just seemed so real. It all seemed so real.</p> <p>After her fingers had worked around her breasts, her whole body tingled and she felt her nipples harden and become very stiff, even a little bit longer, though they were soft pinky. She had a warm feeling around the outside of her pussy. She knew it was wet, actually. She was feeling good but really, really horny. She needed to release that feeling she had for so many years, to feel something go as deep and as long as she did. That was exactly what she didâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
