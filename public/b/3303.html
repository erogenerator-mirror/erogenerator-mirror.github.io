As I watched in horror, he returned a moment later and this time holding two huge batons. I panicked. "Don't hurt me, don't be afraid, okay?"</p> <p>I nodded and he said softly, "I'll call you later. I'll be gone all weekend. Come to America when you can. You should feel good."</p> <p>I thought about that, and I knew I had to give him my virginity. I had to, he was my boyfriend. I had told him so, so I did.</p> <p>"I'll be back with my clothes soon," I said and began to take off my clothes. I hung them carefully in the closet. When I was ready to strip out of my panties, I noticed the man on the couch still there. He had come back to the couch.</p> <p>"You look beautiful. Thank you."</p> <p>I felt him smile and then he reached for something out of his pocket. I saw it was a remote control. The man pressed the button and the television zoomed in on the screen. A moment later the man's fingers were exploring me and I could feel the hardness of the rubber cock he held.</p> <p>Soon he had undressed me and pulled me to a spot on the sofa and I was getting turned on. He pushed the button again and I started squirming on the leather of the sofa. I could feel a strange feeling from excitement. All I wanted was for him to come and fuck me. I wanted to feel him.</p> <p>He walked over to me and leaned over to kiss me and then he was kissing all around my face and neck. He kissed me all over my face then took my nipple into his mouth. It was so good I could feel my pussy getting wet. It hurt, but it felt great. He sucked on my nipple and then let it go.</p> <p>He moved and kissed his way down over my stomach, taking my mound with him until he reached my wetness. He licked my clit and I could feel his fingers moving in me. I moaned and held his head in me. He moved around the sofa, taking my legs and bringing them up to my chest. He put my thighs over his head and licked my clit again. I moaned again and held his head and he smiled and kissed my inner lips. He rubbed his tongue in my wetness and then he was moving it into me and I could feel him licking and sucking at my hole. I was almost over the point of being on the edge.</p> <p>I needed to cum. I thrust my hips and felt the tension in my body, my body. I closed my eyes, let it go. I was on the brink. He moved his tongue over my lips again, then back into my wet pussy and I pushed my hips toward his face, thrusting even faster. I screamed as I began to cum which made him smile. He let go of my legs and they rested on his ears. I fell back and opened my eyes again. They were watching him do himself. He had his mouth and his hands on my clit and the first two fingers of his other hand were working both of my pussy holes.</p> <p>I closed my eyes again and saw the man. A moment later, he started fucking me furiously and I could feel him building, feeling him getting closer. I knew he was about to explode.</p> <p>"Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh please don't stop!" I cried.</p> <p>He lifted my hips up as high as he could and pushed hard in as he started squirting his cum in me. His fingers felt wonderful inside me.</p> <p>"Oh! Oh!"</p> <p>But I was still cumming. My body was in ecstasy and I had no energy left to move or scream. He lifted a bit more and my legs were coming to rest once more over his ears. He kept fingering me and sucking every drop of my cum from my body until I was completely soft. He got up and went to the kitchen to pour himself a cup of coffee and left me to rest on the sofa, still naked, to wait for his next visit. I still felt a bit of guilt at this and yet my body still wanted more.</p> <p>As soon as he was gone I fell asleep in a bit of blissful happiness. I had a dream, one of being fucked by a large white man, which made me cum again. I did not wake.</p> <p>After a while I heard a noise that I knew was coming. I got up and saw a large white man walking towards me and a big black man as well.</p> <p>"Can I help?" I asked them.</p> <p>The black man said, "I'm Dr. Jackson." He smiled, "I am your husband."</p> <p>"I'm John." I said, trying to make it all sound like this experience.
