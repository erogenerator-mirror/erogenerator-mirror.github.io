He was too big to really take her, but he did need a minute or two to give her the full depth.</p> <p>He leaned over her and kissed her neck. She tilted her head back a bit, arching her back. He kissed his way down her body; he kissed her breast, down her stomach to her slit, down and away from her body, slowly. He made his way to her opening with his lips and touched his tongue to her. She gasped. He pulled back once more and looked at her, her beautiful face, her body.</p> <p>"This is what you really need," he said. "Your body."</p> <p>"Mmmmm," she whimpered as he pulled her legs off the bed, spreading them. "No."</p> <p>She had been waiting for it. She wanted that, but didn't know how much this would do. He pushed into her and she grunted at the feel of him. He leaned over her and started fucking her slowly like he had done the night before. Their bodies slapping together, he felt her cum again as he bottomed out on the third thrust, and another, just a little faster, until he was just driving against her, holding still.</p> <p>"Oh, God," she moaned.</p> <p>She heard water running, and a moan came up from behind her, followed by another. She was going to cum again, but could not quite cum herself. She wondered if they would let her, but was disappointed when he stopped, so she opened her eyes, and just turned her head about. She closed her eyes and leaned her head back.</p> <p>"Jesus," she finally moaned.</p> <p>He pulled his hips out of her as she reached to grab hold of the edge of the bed. She sat back.</p> <p>"Not yet, I'm not ready yet," he told her. "Just wait."</p> <p>He climbed off her and she opened her eyes to look at him, then looked down at his erection.</p> <p>"You are about to cum. You may have to pee, but you will have to hold it up, and watch yourself."</p> <p>He sat and watched her, his erection standing out at full mast, pointing down at her feet. The last time he had made love, the last time she'd felt him there, she'd been sitting on him, holding him in, then he'd been there.</p> <p>"I think you ready. I've still got the condom on, and need to take my time, don't you?"</p> <p>She didn't reply, just nodded up her body and leaned forwards.</p> <p>Her lips parted. She was already wet, and he felt her open and close the condom on him as he pulled out.</p> <p>He got up on his knees, moved to push the tip into her, and then pulled all the way out, leaving just the tip inside her.</p> <p>"Oh, God," she whimpered.</p> <p>He started fucking her and she just couldn't move. She was so close to cumming again, and it didn't seem fair to let that happen, to stop so soon now that they both need this so badly.</p> <p>"You're so wet," he told her.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"How wet you're."</p> <p>"I didn't even have time to say it, before I felt you spurt all over me, and I couldn't help it."</p> <p>"How long have we waited?" he asked.</p> <p>"Almost a month."</p> <p>"Why don't we do it when you're ready?"</p> <p>"I'm ready."</p> <p>And he started thrusting in and out of her.</p> <p>"Oh, God," she yelled, and her body tensed; he knew she was close to another, and he pushed inside her one last time, with no warning.</p> <p>She was so ready, her nipples and clitoris were aching to have him move in and out of her body. Her body arched and convulsed around him, but she held on.</p> <p>It had been so long since she'd felt him, never mind felt him inside of her, his cock moving in and out of her and his weight pushing into her, she'd only felt him and not one of her own body parts, and he was driving her wild. The thought made her even more so. The thought made her feel weak, and she collapsed right down onto the bed beside him.</p> <p>"That was amazing. I can't imagine any more of that," she said just as the bathroom door opened.</p> <p>"Oh, don't you dare try," he said. "I'm just going to be a minute here."</p> <p>He closed the door, and grabbed his clothes off the floor. He was going to get outta hereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
