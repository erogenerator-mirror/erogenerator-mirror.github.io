I pushed back, grinding my ass against him. I reached behind me, finding his belt buckle and opening his pants. I pulled the clasp of his boxers open with one hand while with the other, I found the head of his throbbing shaft and found myself gasping as I felt his flesh slide against me. I reached my hand down to cup his heavy sack, feeling how hard it was beneath the fabric, and I felt the head of his cock pushing up against my lips. My whole body quaked as I felt his cock slip between my lips, sliding up into my cunt with an audible pop. He groaned, pressing back into me as I slowly took him deep. It felt so good, so good that I couldn't control myself; he was so much bigger than I had imagined. He pushed back into me, pressing himself into me with his cock deep inside of me, grinding his hips against me each time until he was deep inside of me.</p> <p>"Oh yeah! Oh! Oh! Oh!" I cried out as he fucked me. He pressed himself harder into me, sliding his cock all the way in and grinding against me each time. His hips moved back and forth, trying to get his cock as deep in me as possible without feeling stretched to the point I was uncomfortable, until he groaned, pulling out enough to slide back in. I felt stretched, filled, and full, as he pounded into me. I could feel each thrust, my pussy gripping it, gripping to keep him inside of me. My pussy contracted all over as we took each other, rubbing his cock all about inside of me, squeezing around it in a way that sent both of us over the edge. He slammed into me hard, his balls slapping hard against me each time he hit bottom. My body convulsed with his as I rode the pleasure of him. He groaned loudly each time, grunted each time, and I pushed back into him, trying to capture him even harder in my cunt. He was so hard against me that I could feel him stretching me with each thrust. He grabbed my shoulders, his hands pressing my face down against the bed as he fucked me as hard as he could, making sure our bodies would meet every time they got in sync.</p> <p>"Oh God, yes! Give it to me. Give me all of it!" I yelled as he slammed deep into me one last time and I felt his balls slap my ass and his body tighten as he let loose a long, long shot of cum deep inside of me. Our bodies clenched tightly as our hips ground together, my legs locking on him with each thrust. We held each other and we rocked together in the throes of our orgasms, neither of us wanting to let go of the other after it was over. Finally, we lay still, and I could feel his body against mine, his head buried on the side of mine. We were both breathing deeply, and I didn't have to ask him if it wasn't enough for him, I didn't have to know he had cum in me. I rolled over and looked up at him, his hazel eyes looking back over my shoulder. I pulled his face close to mine and kissed him, forcing his lips to be parted. "I love you," I whispered. He nodded.</p> <p>"I love us too," he said, looking over at me with teary eyes. It felt perfect. I felt like I had known this moment forever, like everything that had already happened was right. It wasn't like I'd been with anyone in years; we could still see each other, know each other, and still have the sex lives we had been lacking. But it wasn't just sex after all, though it was a much bigger part of it, the way we felt about each other.</p> <p>That night, I lay in my bed, waiting for him. I knew it was late, too early. Too early. I knew that I was right to feel the hurt and depression after what we have done, and knowing that I just had this. I needed that feeling to be with him. I didn't want to get away from him that night. I needed his love. I needed him in the arms of my husband. I needed him to love me as much as he always loved me. I needed him to love me as deeply as I loved him. No more guilt, no more guilt on my part as it was, and no more guilt as he had done, because it was time. I had come to my senses just as his body touched mine, and now I would have that love. I reached my hand down and grasped his, wrapping my fingers around his, and caressing his soft skin. I was surprised, but still loving him for this.</p> <p>"I love youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
