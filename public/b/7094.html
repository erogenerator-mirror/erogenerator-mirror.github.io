She looked good, her white hair framing her deep green eyes as she stood naked before me, the last of her clothing. "Now let's talk about why we're going to be here, don't you think?"</p> <p>I wasn't a long-term fan of talking about my love, but I agreed and we set up our little chat room. We chatted, and I found myself falling back against the armchair, my hands going to my pussy, where I masturbated to the images we were discussing online. She was the first to get a word in though, and she went right back to her clothes, where she removed her dress as she talked, leaving it on the floor in the middle of the room, revealing a thin strip of hair, which matched her panties. I watched, my hand rubbing my clitoris as she dressed; sometimes I could tell that I was coming, and as she turned around, I could see a small wet patch on the front of her panties that turned me on.</p> <p>"Come on!" She said, leaning over, her arms wrapped around my head as I lay back on the floor beside her and kissed her deeply. This was too much, I just wanted to come, but I didn't want to be late for work, even if it was just for the chat room. "Now come on, please?" She said. She had a point...</p> <p>The rest of my day went on as normal, I could have continued our conversation there, given the time I spent with my phone on, but my mind was in overdrive. My fantasies in particular were on the verge of reaching a climax, and my own arousal was obvious. I looked at the time, only half an hour after we talked, my pussy twitched as I pictured Tina on her back, a look of sheer pleasure on her face. I quickly undressed, and got on the edge of the bed, looking at my pussy, already tingling from my earlier thoughts. I fingered myself, and spread my legs, taking in a gasp as I heard her voice behind me, and then I heard her coming to the bedroom door.</p> <p>The sound of footsteps was very loud, and I knew she was going to come in. "Come in," I said. "I'm not done talking." I turned my face to smile, and I saw the first sight she would see of me all day. The first thing she saw when she came back into the room with her dress was me naked, and her eyes lingered on my half-naked body as long as she could, as if she were looking for an excuse to steal my manhood.</p> <p>"Well, aren't you eager for what I am about to do?" She said, smiling as she sat on the edge of the bed, her body looking very sexy with the pink and white tights, which gave her the most erotic effect. "But I still haven't told you, or your job for that matter. I just have yet to tell you."</p> <p>"What?" I said, not quite sure I was ready for that. I wasn't sure for how long I'd have the opportunity to keep an eye on her now, but by now I felt that it would be impossible to hide my nakedness from her, or herself. "I'm sorry... I'm sorry, I just don't know what I want to hear."</p> <p>"That's ok. I'm not mad at you at all. I promise, I won't tell anyone..."</p> <p>"And what do you promise?" I couldn't bring myself to meet her gaze, and I was scared to tell her what I still wanted to. "Promise me you'll never..."</p> <p>"We promised," she said, leaning back, her legs spread, and I saw that she wasn't wearing any underwear or skirt. She was shaved, and her pussy was smooth, but clearly not for me. She was so close I had a fleeting thought she might not be as clean as I first thought, but she was still clean enough after all this. "Don't worry. We'll never tell anyone either, I swear."</p> <p>"You still think you can keep that promise? You promised us to never tell anyone! You promised us to never tell anyone at all!" I couldn't believe my own words, and had to fight to refrain from laughing. I knew her to be a self-proclaimed exhibitionist. She was never shy or shy in answering any of my questions, and after we had calmed down I was able to get a bit more into it.</p> <p>"You are incredible," I answered. "So nice to get to know people." I gave her a long look, and realized, she still had the sameâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
