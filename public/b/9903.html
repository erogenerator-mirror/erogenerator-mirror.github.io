Maybe the water was okay with you...but I feel like you've been avoiding me. I'm so sorry."</p> <p>"I know. I wasn't that long of a back rub...all this tension I'm having with you being here..."</p> <p>"Don't feel bad. I'm glad you're here."</p> <p>I reached for another drink and took a gulp but then I looked around and realized it was getting dark. It was early-evening...and a bit chilly out on this late October afternoon.</p> <p>"Let me get you a jacket, it'll dry out," I said as I handed her a long jacket. She took it and put it on. We got out of the car and I sat her in the car. She took one arm and helped me get her into the back and up to the front of the car. The back of the car was cool to the touch--I thought maybe she'd had a cold drink while it was still warm. I reached up a finger for the lock and the key. I opened the doors, got out and got the key. I opened the car door and motioned her to get in and get off. She slid in easily but I had my arm around her, her head pressed against mine and our lips were touching. Her hand felt warm and gentle, even though it was on my thigh. Our mouths opened and our tongues danced as I felt her move against me.</p> <p>"Let's go," she said with a grin.</p> <p>We reached the house quickly, her hand in mine as we walked. We could both see the fire through the curtains, the sound of people outside. We walked to the entrance and I had a key in one hand and a key in the other, walking slowly so she wouldn't try and get us in the door. She pulled her keys from her hand and unlocked the door. We were in front of a large room, the fireplace dim and inviting. She turned me around to face the fire. She reached up and undid my shirt. I stepped out of it and tossed it to the right. She ran her hands across my chest and slid down the front of my pants, finding my hard-on through my shorts.</p> <p>"My God," whispered the voice of the voice she was about to turn and turn around the corner.</p> <p>She turned to face the man who had brought her away from the storm door she was watching. He stood there for about fifteen seconds, taking in the view in front of him. Then he moved and he and she turned, he walked to both of us. She reached up and took my face in her palms. She kissed me, hard.</p> <p>"I love your face, so much..." she whispered in my ear. "It's been so long...but I love you." She whispered again, a little longer. "And...I love you inside." Her eyes got wide and she started to unbutton my shorts. I stepped out, and she pulled off the last article of clothing I had on. She got back on her feet and stepped one foot out of her shoes, then reached up with the opposite hand and undid the hook at the bottom of my shorts. My cock popped out, springing up out of the water. She licked her lips and moved her hand to the head. She pulled open the front of my shorts, the top of my cock was exposed, and I stepped out of them as she started to rub me. I was so hard, and my dick was so wet from her wet tongue. I felt her hand take more pressure on me and she leaned in and slid her tongue inside of me as her hand worked up and down.</p> <p>"I love how your hard dick tastes," she said softly as she moved her tongue out and along my length. She kissed around, my cock. She pulled her face away and went on kissing and licking her way up my cock, finally putting all it was in her mouth. She slid her mouth back down, taking all of me in before she pulled back and looked up at me.</p> <p>"My God, this can't continue," she said.</p> <p>We kissed, her hand still stroking me. We kissed for several minutes. My dick was dripping with pre-cum. She got up and put her arms around me, kissing me there to taste me. She moved her hands up to my chest and ran her fingers through my chest hair. She took my hard cock once again and put it in her mouth again. I watched her head bob up and down, her tongue dancing along the base of my cock at the top. I was ready to cum and started to pull her onto me. She let me slide out of her mouth and went back to the base of my cock.</p> <p>"Not yet," she said and smiled at me.</p> <p>She sat the full drink bottle across theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
