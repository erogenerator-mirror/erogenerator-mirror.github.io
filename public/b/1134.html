What if the outcome was the same as the previous one? I didn't want to lose her any more, certainly not with an open relationship. In the end it turned out that despite an initial hesitance, I got over my apprehension, and got on with my life.</p> <p>The first night I had a talk with a lawyer I met at a meeting. They had heard my divorce through the grapevine, he got a divorce and told me that my wife would always keep away from me and never speak to me for more than a year. I had nothing to worry about.</p> <p>He then had me sign a contract that stated that at the end of this relationship, my company had to agree with everything my business required. I had no right to speak with my lawyer on the condition that we were still engaged in the business, and he was to be the firm as stated in the contract.</p> <p>I started to feel a little worse after the lawyer left, I took a long hot shower, shaved, and dressed to go out to dinner. I left my clothes in the office, made sure there was no evidence that we were engaged in anything other than what was expected and I wanted to be as discrete as possible. I picked an outfit to wear. I made sure the top was tight enough to show off some cleavage, and a skirt that wasn't too short to show off my stocking tops. I chose a black corset and garters. The corset had its effect and made my chest look bigger. I put on a little extra high heel and put my collar on. I applied some more makeup, and a smoky eye shadow and eyeliner. I checked myself in the mirror and decided against a bra, I liked me curves, and the corset didn't help at all to keep them firm. I pulled on my tight black mini-skirt, and a tight top. It had a lot of thigh which made it look so sexy. I added my makeup, put on my best heels, a silver necklace that held my wedding band on, and my diamond tiara and a very nice pair of earrings that I thought I would put down soon enough after dinner. I took a deep breath and headed for the restaurant.</p> <p>The dinner started and the wine was gone. I was so happy that my marriage was finally finished up that I thought that I was more excited about it than going. The waiter brought us a bottle of champagne, which we both sipped in an instant. Our eyes met briefly and I couldn't stop the excitement as I smiled and winked at him. I couldn't believe how good that felt - that our roles were reversed, he seemed to be taking a dominant role as she was taken charge and he was making me submit.</p> <p>When we came back to our table, he stood and motioned for the waiter to refill our glasses before placing the bottle back in the ice bucket. He walked away once he saw me sitting beside him. For a few seconds we just looked at each other, both of us trying everything to look as calm and composed as possible.</p> <p>"So are you going to be quiet the whole evening?" He said with a smile, not seeming to think that we were playing a little game.</p> <p>"Well, you were right, I can't say that I'm totally alone in all these clothes," I admitted with a laugh.</p> <p>"That's OK," he said. He reached across the table and took my hand, and squeezed it firmly. "You look lovely in your clothes and I can't wait to see your face when you get home...."</p> <p>I looked up into the bright blue eyes, and noticed he was looking me up and down, not directly at my legs or breasts.</p> <p>"Well, what do you think? Is it too much to ask for a meal here on a Monday night to be more than a drink and a meal?" I gave him a knowing smile.</p> <p>"It's not too much to ask," he said with a wry smile. "If I have to, I'll tell you." He put a hand under my chin, and lifted my face to meet his mouth. I melted in his arms, his firm lips pressed gently against mine. When his tongue gently touched mine, I almost lost myself. It felt wonderful, like a soft caress, and so warm and wonderful. His hands wandered down to my upper thigh and just inside the material of my skirt. When his fingers touched me there, I was surprised and a little bit wet. He smiled, and leaned down to kiss me, this time my lips parted, not for me to object, but for myself to allow him access. He kissed me for a short eternity, then slowly, sweetly, opened his mouth and drew my lips down to meet his. Our lips met, then kissed again, again and again until we startedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
