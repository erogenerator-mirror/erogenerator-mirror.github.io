Two of the women pulled out cameras. One of the women, named Liza, asked a couple of questions. One woman, Liza, looked at me and said there was something wrong on the front of the car, I should see a doctor. She said I should go to the police, the whole episode will be explained after the video was passed around. I told her I would take her home but I was sure she did, since there were cameras there.</p> <p>When I got home from the store, I could hear my father in the den. I sat next to him naked. Then I turned around and saw the front door opening. Dad came into the den and sat down. He looked like a child, his eyes looking me over. He reached out and handed me a piece of paper, saying, here it is. Now you know! Do you know anything?" I said I do now.</p> <p>"Yes" he said, "but I have a question for you. The way you answer your question, you could be right! Are you okay with what I did?"</p> <p>I told him there was nothing wrong. It was all so strange. Dad looked at me and then turned and left the den without saying anything else. I knew I had to do something. This would be the first time in my life I had sex with a man. I knew I would do anything to get to it. I knew I loved Dad; I couldn't give him up, even if he said no. But I knew it would hurt him to be turned down. I knew there were some things I wanted in life and I had to try to fix them.</p> <p>When I got back into the den, he had left the room.</p> <p>"Do you know what they were doing at the time?" I asked.</p> <p>"No" he replied, "that part didn't happen."</p> <p>"So what happened, if you have any idea what happened?"</p> <p>"I didn't do anything, except watch." He looked down at his cock and laughed, again. He looked up at me and said, "Your father told that one of his friends that you were dating. Her name was Susan. You know, Susan Williams, the school slut?"</p> <p>I didn't know how to respond. Why would he talk about her having sex with a woman, if it wasn't her? Why didn't Dad tell me that? Would he be upset if I didn't know? That was how it was between him and Dad, right? So my answer was, "You know what they are doing?"</p> <p>"You heard what they were saying."</p> <p>"No, you can't tell me. Not to tell you, not to tell me." I answered.</p> <p>"Please, don't believe what they are saying. I don't know what I think, but I do know you feel wrong. I know you are in love with my brother, not my father, I know that. But what do I know?"</p> <p>He just looked at me, his eyes shining. "He loves you, more than anyone, is that clear?" he asked.</p> <p>This time, I did answer, "He's in love with you." I said it without even really knowing if he believed it.</p> <p>He looked me in the eye, then leaned down and kissed me. Our lips pressed tight with passion. Then both of us started to walk off, with him still in the car. "I'm sorry I said that, it doesn't mean anything. It just happened, just something happened."</p> <p>"It's okay" I said, "I have some questions to ask you too."</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>"This is not a bad time. I don't want to make up with my husband. But I know I wouldn't like to see you like that. So we better get moving. I can't live in the house anymore if I go to bed with you. We have plenty of time."</p> <p>I had to say something. "Do you mean the way you made you choice between me and my mom when I was born?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"I don't think I want to know."</p> <p>"Well, if you can tell me that I can keep it in my bedroom till I die and you can try to keep it a secret." I said sarcastically.</p> <p>"I don't know that, Dad is probably already dead." I said, knowing it would be true.</p> <p>"Maybe you shouldn't be telling him that you and Susan are having sex all the time." Dad added, then added, "I'm pretty sure I'll know if you want us to talk about it."</p> <p>I stopped talking, not knowing what to say.</p> <p>"Mom and I did it a lotâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
