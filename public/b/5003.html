We've fought for our country a year and now we're fighting for our people in America." I paused and thought for a moment.</p> <p>"I'm not just your President, I'm your Commander."</p> <p>"How would you feel about me sleeping with your cousin- your best friend?" A few long seconds passed before she turned and started laughing.</p> <p>I laughed with her, "It must be fun to be so close to all of you," I said. "I know you feel the same way. We can't have a wedding ceremony in this city, do you remember? I'll bet you my cousins and friends would love to meet your wives and cousin."</p> <p>"Yes! Of course I do. I love our family to the max," she said with a soft smile. "And I don't know what else to do. I just hope my parents' aren't as close to me as I was."</p> <p>I shrugged and stood up. We walked into the back room with my arms around her waist.</p> <p>"I hope you don't mind my doing," she said and pulled my hands off her waist.</p> <p>"Of course I mind. My parents have seen my face before, and that's probably why I don't mind that you're sitting down." She looked down at me, "I just hope I'm not upsetting those people there."</p> <p>"No, I wouldn't worry about them. They're nice people and won't mind in anyway."</p> <p>We walked out into the cool crispness of the sun to my car. The car smelled wonderful and we walked together out of the parking lot. As we got to the car, I opened the door for her and put my arm around her back. She squeezed me with her body and I could feel her breasts pressed against my chest.</p> <p>"How were your classes?" I asked as I opened the car door for her.</p> <p>"They were OK, but nothing I couldn't handle up to the end," she said.</p> <p>"Are you going to a reunion soon?" I wondered out of the blue.</p> <p>"Yes, very soon." She turned her head and looked at me again. "Are your parents there?"</p> <p>"Yes." I saw confusion in her eyes and wondered what would happen. She was expecting to be married next May after graduation, but maybe we could go to the same college. We were only planning to live together for a year, but I wasn't sure if we would stay together all that long.</p> <p>"Is this going to be a stay in our lives, too?" She seemed confused.</p> <p>"That depends," I thought for a moment. "Your parents might be gone a few days, so maybe we could go visit them. They're in town this weekend, and will probably be staying at home. Let me get my truck and we can pull over to get in the back."</p> <p>I turned and grabbed my car keys. "It's not a big deal, since I'm going home with my cousins." That explained it.</p> <p>"I see, but do you remember the time we spent together? We did everything at home... you know... your mom, and your stepdad, and even my dad, and your stepmom." She smiled at me.</p> <p>"Yes, I remember."</p> <p>"I think we'll really enjoy spending many days together. Now how about your cousin- your dad?"</p> <p>She leaned in and gave me a soft kiss, "I'm going to miss you."</p> <p>"Don't worry about your cousin, because we'll be having such a good visit next month," I said, turning off the car.</p> <p>Chapter 11</p> <p>I drove to our local motel. On the drive over to the motel, I talked about how things had been going ever so well in our lives. I was getting really excited about meeting with my two cousins. The first cousin would be going to my uncle's wedding, but the second cousin would be going to Uncle Sam... and her husband's wedding.</p> <p>Her mother- well she would be gone for awhile with her father. It would be at least two week until she was safely back home. I decided to let her sleep it off. I walked her to her car. With me behind her I took off her high heels and sat her against the headrest.</p> <p>My left arm was around her waist but my right hand was on her thigh. She was wearing a skirt and her legs were closed, but I could feel her stocking-tops. I kissed her on her neck and started to caress her with my tongue. I licked and sucked her neckline, but she made no move to resist my kisses. Her neck was soft with a sexy taste.</p> <p>I kissed down her sternum, my fingers tickling lightly there. I kissed lower on her shoulder and down her chestâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
