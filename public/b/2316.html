She shot back. "He asked me to wear shorts."</p> <p>"And we stopped fucking for half the day, in a little bit."</p> <p>"So, you're with me now?"</p> <p>I laughed as I reached up and put my arm around her. She leaned up and gave me a gentle kiss, while holding me tight. She reached my shoulder with one hand and started to rub and stroke me again.</p> <p>"No, you have to go back to being with me." I said softly as my fingers combed through her short hair. My voice was low and quiet, and she looked up at me in response. "Yes, you have to go back to being with me." I said and smiled.</p> <p>"Yes." She said, as her eyes closed. I leaned up and kissed her again, this time a little longer, and I felt her hand touch mine, which I let her slip mine so she could feel something else. We kissed for a long time again, gently, our lips and hands rubbing and caressing until she pulled away from me, and I felt her mouth moving over to my ear, and kiss it, my earlobe, and all the way to my mouth.</p> <p>"Will you let me, just watch if you want." I whispered in her ear, and she nodded excitedly, her face flushed with a mixture of passion and anger. She pushed my skirt to the floor and crawled over to where my shorts were on the floor. I slipped my shorts off as I lay back on the couch, not wanting to lose this wonderful opportunity. She was wearing a tight pink babydoll that hugged her body. I took it off without a second thought and laid down next to her, pulling her onto me, her body on top of mine, my breasts pressed against hers as our nakedness was in full view of my husband's living room.</p> <p>"Take me, lover.....just, just....do this...." She said in a soft voice.</p> <p>"No, I'm not going to let you." I told her, and her eyes widened in surprise.</p> <p>"You're just going to take off my bra, my panties.....just do it." She said, and started undoing the buttons of her blouse. She shrugged out of it without any resistance, giving me a wonderful view of her beautiful breasts, the nipples already erect, and jiggling from the attention of my hands. Her eyes stayed locked on mine as she undid the final buttons. I kept my eyes on hers as she undid her blouse, exposing the lacy bra that matched the pink panties that she wore. I felt her hands slide the last of her clothes off her body as she stared at me, admiring the way her pink nipples poked through the fabric of her bra. My nipples were rock hard, and she felt them get harder. After undoing the last button, I drew the bra strap down over her shoulders and shoulders and let the straps fall down her arms, leaving her beautiful breasts hanging free in the warm night air. I could tell just by the way she moved that she was turned on by the way my eyes kept going back and forth between her full breasts and soft pink nipples.</p> <p>"Do you like that?" I whispered to her.</p> <p>"Yes." Her voice came out as a whisper, almost a whimper.</p> <p>"Do you want me to make love to your tits or you can just watch, I love watching you, just watch" I continued, as she leaned back and looked at me, then back to her naked eyes.</p> <p>"I was watching you for a long time."</p> <p>"Would you like to watch me?" She responded.</p> <p>"I'm your husband." I said quickly. "And if you would like to watch me having sex with another man, that's all you have to say."</p> <p>"I'll ask you again, before we start....but remember, never make love to me, I can tell when you are about to say this, I want you right now. I want to watch you being with another man.....and you can choose whether or not you want to do what you are doing.....but remember, if you feel uncomfortable, stop immediately.....just do it. Your choice." I said with my heart in my throat, as she continued to watch me for a few seconds before I put her back down.</p> <p>"I don't want to watch you." She said, finally looking at me.</p> <p>"Why not?". I said, my heart beating quickly, my skin glistening from my sweat. I smiled as I slid off the couch and knelt in front of her. I could see how turned on she was, she could hardly walk.
