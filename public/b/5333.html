It was like a flame licking the skin around my face, the touch electric me. It had nothing to do with my being a woman at all, my body responding to its lover in kind. He had a wicked grin on his face. As he licked a little higher, he looked up at me with those devilish eyes and said "You're going to be mine!"</p> <p>My heart fluttered in my chest, my knees lifted, my body tingled and a rush of warmth spread throughout my body from head to toe. The warmth spread through my pussy and spread to my cheeks. Suddenly, a wave of euphoria rushed through me and my nipples hardened. My pussy started to throb as well, my lips were swollen and swollen, my clit was hard as a rock in its hood. I wanted to take it out, taste it, but I didn't. My mind and mind was racing, my mouth, lungs, my body were so focused on pleasing my lover. I couldn't do that! "I need you!" I thought desperately.</p> <p>His breath was hot on my skin, hot against my throat and lips as he licked me again. I was surprised when I was aware of his hands on my body and the feeling of his hands on me. It was only moments. His kisses on my thighs were wet with juice and saliva. My body quivered, like the waves crashing on me after a thunderstorm. I opened my legs more for him, almost begging for more, but it was to no avail.</p> <p>He wanted me to let him do it. I told him so, but he kept moving his mouth up my legs. I felt him rub his face in circles under my ass. I felt my insides quiver, yet he did nothing. My inner walls closed down against him in a warm shudder that seemed to go on forever. I felt his nose against me and breathed deeply. I took in every bit of his aroma; the scent of him, the musk that filled my nostrils, the musky odor of him.</p> <p>The feeling of his tongue licking my thighs and his hands on my ass was driving me crazy. I had an idea.</p> <p>I moved myself forward, pushing against his face as he licked my legs and my pussy. I felt his hands run along my thighs and move closer to my ass. I pulled my legs back to my chest so he could play with them a bit. There was no resistance when he touched me there. I felt his hand slide between my legs, feeling the hotness of my pussy. He started at my hole and rubbed the moisture on my clit, then moved down, rubbing the tip of his tongue along my hole as he pulled on my thighs.</p> <p>I felt the fingers that were still in me and began to move it in and out. His fingers were moving me up, up with his tongue, up and down, sliding in and out of me. I felt him push his tongue against me and I shuddered as I came. I felt his hands on my hips and knew that he didn't want to leave any part of my body for even more of his licks.</p> <p>As my orgasm faded there, I felt the fingers he was rubbing me with. I started to push back against him, and felt something soft and hot against my ass. He knew what I was really needing. He pushed harder against me and then slowly started to finger-fuck me with a thumb. He moved his tongue in and out of me, licking the pussy so beautifully. I began to come back down, and he lapped me again. He held his fingers inside me, moving the rest inside me. He pressed his thumb against my ass and my pussy. I felt the tip of his thumb press against my inner walls, it felt as if it was penetrating my body.</p> <p>My pussy was so slippery. My outer walls squeezed him tight as his thumb pushed against my inner muscles. My body quivered and shook as he pressed harder against the base of my pussy. "Oh God! It feels so good!" I thought.</p> <p>He slowed his hands and took his tongue from my ass. He kissed it lightly and then kissed down my stomach once again, licking as he neared my pussy. His tongue slid between my pussy lips as my hips lifted to his face, and he pulled back. I felt him lick me again. His mouth sucked on my pussy, his tongue slid along the underside of my lips, up to my clit, and he took it between his teeth and held it. I lifted my body onto his face, moaning as he suckled me with one of his fingers deep inside me.</p> <p>I felt him move away, and then I felt his tongue slide up against the lips. I closed my legs as his hands moved to my thighs, his hands pushed the rest of my body down hard against himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
