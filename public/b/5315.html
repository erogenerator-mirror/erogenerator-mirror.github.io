He was the only one of them to have his name tag on the paper.</p> <p>"And who are you?" he snapped.</p> <p>"Um, Emma?" she replied, confused.</p> <p>He pointed in the general direction of the desk where the papers were. He picked them up and tossed them into a pile on his desk. "And what's this all about?" he asked as he passed her the papers.</p> <p>"I'm not sure I-"</p> <p>"Well, the only way you would know," he said. "It's just as well you're not on your own."</p> <p>He tossed the papers into the pile and pulled out the paper from his pocket and unfolded it. "I'm going to have to leave. It's your problem. You're going to learn about yourself."</p> <p>"What? What are you talking about?"</p> <p>He turned to her. "Well, like you just said, there's nothing you can do about your problem."</p> <p>"What do you mean, there's nothing I can do about it," she asked, trying to sit up straight.</p> <p>"Just relax," he said. "It's okay."</p> <p>"But can't you just, you know..."</p> <p>"The alternative is to be in denial. You have to start over, not start over," he said.</p> <p>"Please don't call me by the wrong name," she said, her body trembling with fear.</p> <p>"We've both been there already. You know that. You want to feel your body against yours, just like you do now. Just like you do now," he laughed. "It's as easy as that."</p> <p>He pulled the papers into his other hand and held them up before her.</p> <p>"I can have you right where you are now," he said as he reached up and ran the sharp nails of his hand down the front of her right breast, making her shiver. "Just like my finger can do."</p> <p>He slid his hands lower, across her abdomen, and down her thighs. He paused again, letting the goose bumps rise on her bare skin and over her thighs.</p> <p>"But I can give you what you want."</p> <p>"What is that?" she asked.</p> <p>"I can't give you what you want when you've been waiting, waiting, hoping, wishing. But you are willing to give up your life... to feel what it's like to be my student. Just like I can give you what you need." He pulled on the tie string that tied her top closed and she whimpered as the thin, white fabric fell to the sides, exposing her breasts to his eager fingers. "Or, I can give you what I'm going to make you need," he said as he pulled the strings up the other side. "Oh, you have a beautiful body, and a good figure, and, at school you were a perfect student," he said as his lips made their way down the side of her neck. "We're going to make you the perfect slave. Just as my teacher taught us."</p> <p>He took her left nipple in his mouth, holding it in with his teeth and tongue of his fingers, rolling it in his fingertips while he felt up her body, feeling the heat emanating from her, feeling herself.</p> <p>His eyes flashed as they locked on hers and she could feel how aroused and turned on she was. She could feel the moisture growing between the inner lips of her vagina. The wetness building inside of her as she felt her body responding to the teasing touches of her best friend's touch.</p> <p>His fingers played with her nipples until they were rock-hard and her head was thrashing in her own pleasure. She began to pant as he pulled one of them out of the top of her bathing suit and licked along the smooth contours between her cleavage.</p> <p>"Do you want to do it with me?" he asked as he slipped the bottoms off of her and sat her down on his desk. He let the ties on the string in the front slide loose as he got his mouth to her nipples.</p> <p>"Yes," she hissed, her hands pulling at the silky fabric covering her crotch. "Oh, no. Let me have it," she moaned as he began to lick and suck on her breasts... "please," she begged.</p> <p>"Be quiet," he said. "You will wake anyone who comes in to ask you a question."</p> <p>"Please," she begged again. "Oh, pleaseâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
