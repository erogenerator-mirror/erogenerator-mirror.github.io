He opened his eyes and looked straight at the woman.</p> <p>“It’s not hard, either,” she corrected.</p> <p>He thought.</p> <p>“It’s the first time.”</p> <p>The woman shrugged. In the mirror, her face glowed darkly as she looked at the mirror. The expression on his face told her everything that he was thinking. It didn’t disappoint her though, he thought, looking at his naked genitals. He felt his cock surge up hard against the front of his panties. The woman turned round slowly to look at his crotch.</p> <p>He looked down at her face and gasped. Her dark hair hung round her face like a black curtain of black gold. She was a very attractive woman, he thought, although it might be a little strange. The woman stood stock still, turning her head to the left and back to the mirror. Her eyes looked over his cock, still engorged.</p> <p>“It’s hard!” she said.</p> <p>The man watched fascinated as the woman drew her fingers round the length of his cock. She held it in both hands as she masturbated him.</p> <p>“She’s beautiful,” he whispered to himself. “She's so lovely.”</p> <p>He felt the blood pumping into his cock as he watched the woman touch herself and masturbate. He felt his cock throb and throb. He felt his balls tighten.</p> <p>He looked at the mirror. It was just as his mother had done. He saw his mother smile at him as he sat there in the chair. His mother turned it on as she knelt in front of him.</p> <p>He looked down at the woman’s head and watched as her tongue slipped out and licked the side of his penis. The man had lost himself in the feel of his mother’s fingers playing with him. The woman’s free hand stroked the front of the man’s briefs and he felt the woman’s fingers slip inside. The woman’s head went up and down as she licked him.</p> <p>He watched as the woman masturbated him. He felt his cock surge even harder. His head was swimming with sensations that seemed to be radiating from every point of his body.</p> <p>The woman suddenly stood up.</p> <p>“Don’t cum yet,” she murmured, her fingers still playing with the male organ beneath her.</p> <p>He looked up at her. Her long straight hair was wild about her head like dark, black snakes. Her face was dark like the mists around the room. She was tall, her face full of vitality. He found she was beautiful. She looked down at herself from the mirror. The sight of her face made him gasp. Her lips hung open. She was beautiful, the sight of herself making him want to come very excited him. His cock was hard and thick, jutting from his body in all its full glory. It was all he could do to keep from feeling the head of his prick pressed up hard against the leg of the chair.</p> <p>She reached out and took hold of him. She slid her fingers over the skin of him in long slow strokes. She bent herself and kissed him gently. She kissed him hard on the lips. He felt the woman’s tongue probing between him and he moaned as he felt her fingers play with his penis. He closed his eyes as she stroked him. The woman’s lips closed over the tip of his prick and he groaned as the tip of his prick became enveloped between her lips.</p> <p>When she got to the hilt of him, she bent and licked him from sac to tip; tasting him, making him sigh and groan as she did.</p> <p>The man could not hold it much longer. He had no intentions of moving in his chair. He looked down at the woman, his mother, who had still not had her head up and down on his penis, her mouth open in a wide oval. He watched as the woman’s tongue lashed the end of his prick, and he felt the fluid inside of her wet tongue as it worked it’s way around him. He looked at his prick as the woman’s mouth worked it. The man had no idea of what his mother had tasted like. The man looked into the mirror at his mother’s face taking his cock into her mouth, the tongue in her mouth working his prick. His head came back as the woman held him firmly in her hand, the fingers of her other hand fondling his balls as she sucked him.</p> <p>The man groaned—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
