Don't you like to keep your boyfriends away from you?"</p> <p>She turned her face away and shook her head.</p> <p>"Why don't you just stay right here and let me take care of you right here?"</p> <p>I pulled her back into me and kissed her ear as a warning, then trailed down her neck with my tongue. I slipped one arm behind her back and lifted her up, taking my hand off of her shoulder to her upper back as we moved.</p> <p>The cool air on the hot skin of her back made her nipples stand up, pushing against the thin fabric of my shirt with each step. I kissed down her neck again, letting her hair spill over my face. I turned her to face me, and she reached for my hand to let me lead her out of the bathroom.</p> <p>Once we were in the sitting room, we both looked around. It was a nice place to sit and relax. We were both alone in it. I turned to her, looking for approval or approval of the way she looked, which I could hardly detect through the simple fabric of her shirt.</p> <p>"Go ahead. Take your time and let me take care of you."</p> <p>I moved in closer, giving her better access. She kept her eyes closed as I knelt on the floor in front of her and put my hand on her knee.</p> <p>"Are you sure this is a good idea?"</p> <p>She didn't answer.</p> <p>"No, you can shut up and let me take care of you."</p> <p>She stopped shaking with excitement, and spread her legs for me in her chair. I didn't need a request. I lifted her skirt, then slid my hands under the hem, taking the skirt back down to her ankles. She lifted her skirt again to help, then leaned back in the chair, resting her head against the armrest with her legs on my lap. We looked at each other, our eyes barely visible. My heart was beating a mile a minute. I leaned over and kissed her on the lips, then she turned her head and pressed her lips to my mouth as I took it in. Our tongues danced and circled each other as she pressed herself against me. When we broke, we were both breathing heavy, our eyes closed.</p> <p>I pulled back, and she opened her eyes in response. She leaned back, with her legs still around my neck, and pulled me back a little so that I was lying on my back on the floor. We were both breathing hard, and I was sweating.</p> <p>Still holding on to her face, I took it in my hands and looked into her eyes.</p> <p>"There is a good thing about being in love with someone as much as I love you"</p> <p>"So, are you going to put that tongue of yours to work?" she asked me as she moved her hand to her pussy and started rubbing it.</p> <p>"Oh, I don't know about that..."</p> <p>She laughed as she started licking the inside of my ear in a way that made me shiver. I don't know why, but I felt such an urge to have her between my legs all those years ago when I was just a little drunker. I felt like I was losing the ability to speak, if she was willing to touch me there.</p> <p>"You are going to do just fine."</p> <p>She smiled at me, then pushed herself up so that she was sitting on my waist.</p> <p>"Hmmm, let's see...let's see what you can do with those."</p> <p>She slipped one of my hands under her shirt and slowly let it slide off her shoulders just to the top strap of her bra. She started lifting her upper body up to undo the top strap when she let it slide down her arms. Her breasts swung free before me, their size still causing my prick to pulse.</p> <p>She pulled the bottom of her shirt up and over her head, and I noticed that she had a tight body - small and tight, with long, straight hair. She kept her back straight, and her shoulders looked like one of the many hills that nature had brought up in its native country. That was why she was so short, in a short skirt and a bikini top she wore.</p> <p>She took both of her hands and started squeezing and tweaking her nipples, then she leaned forward and pulled up the bottom part of her shirt to reveal her pussy. I reached my hands out to her, feeling for that gorgeous pussy under the flaps of her little sarong. I didn't have to touch her there; her skin was so soft and soft to my touch and my fingertips.</p> <p>She lifted herself up to me and started rubbing her breasts through the thin material of her skirt to get a better feel of them. She reached for my zipper, then slowly unbuttoned and lowered the zipperâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
