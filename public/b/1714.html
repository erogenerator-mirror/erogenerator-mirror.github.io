He headed upstairs and I heard a toilet flush. I could hear the water running. He came downstairs still dressed and carrying a coffee mug. He sat the mug down in front of me and took a sip before saying, "So, what did you call yourself? I can think of several."</p> <p>"Well, after we had that meeting, I had to run up a list of how to get started. By that time I didn't have too great a time going through all the scenarios that you talked about. Of course I thought about you all the time, but I didn't put much thought about you being the one that I would be talking to. It was like I was seeing a different person each time it came up." He smiled a little. "I was curious, and it was fun to talk to. I wanted to do it again... but we had to do a few things first." His smile stayed until he turned to go up the stairs. I caught him following me up the stairs. When his lips met mine and his arms came around me she broke the kiss.</p> <p>"Let's go in the bedroom, I want to make love".</p> <p>He led me down the hall and into the master bedroom, it had an oversized double bed which he lay down on. He got me on my knees and went around to the side of the bed with his hand guiding mine to the base of my cock. I didn't need any instruction. I got up on my knees beside his waist and he positioned my cock at the entrance to his ass. He had his eyes closed, he really liked it that way. I teased his anal hole a little, and it didn't take long for him to take what he wanted. He wasn't so tight as in the previous two sessions he let me slide in after a couple minutes.</p> <p>"I've been waiting to get you inside me. It feels so good."</p> <p>I leaned over him, kissing the end of each of his nipples as I rubbed against them. I lifted the other half of his body up and straddled his waist. He felt great. My cock was in him as far as it would go.</p> <p>"Ooo that's nice. You know how to make me feel good. You know how I'd like you."</p> <p>I laid his body down on the bed again.</p> <p>"I want you to put your cock back inside me. I want to feel it inside me."</p> <p>His arms circled me and pulled me closer. Our bodies were pressed together as hard as rocks were rocking them. I reached up with both hands and pulled the blindfold down. I looked up at him with a smirk. I was in charge of him again and I liked that! I moved back and forth on the bed as he looked up at me and started fucking me again.. Again!</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I think I might be getting close again."</p> <p>I smiled at that. I was right! I felt him pull away as he thrust his cock back inside me. We changed places once again and I wanted him even more as he had done with his ex. He put his hands on my hips and fucked me as hard and fast as I'd ever been fucked. I knew he wouldn't go for what I was trying to accomplish. That made it all the better, I really had no idea how else to please him. It was the way he looked at me and the way we looked and even when our eyes were closed we were saying a lot of things. If we were on any level he would be there. He didn't seem to want to look away. He was in command. We were both there. We knew that, I really wanted to make love with him. I knew it was important to keep it that way. We were both going to love it.</p> <p>"I'm gonna cum." his voice was hoarse and he wasn't going to hold it back any longer. I pulled away from him when I felt him starting to spray again. He was right on the threshold, his body shook underneath, and he yelled out like I had never heard before. I stopped moving.</p> <p>He laughed. "You liked that didn't you?"</p> <p>I looked at him with a smile. I didn't think I could have handled the way he had done this to me. I started to get up off him, but he stopped me. He just looked me in the eyes and said "Come lay back." He got on his back. He leaned his head up to mine and we stayed there, kissing. We got ready for more when he pulled me down off of his softening cock and said, "I want you to cum on my face again".</p> <p>I was going to turn over and go back down and then get back up but I stopped. "I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
