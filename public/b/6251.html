I whispered.</p> <p>"You can. Please." I begged. I'd had my eyes screwed shut and was looking at the ceiling as my fingers curled into fists and my eyes pleaded with me. There was no way I would be able to let anything break this down.</p> <p>"You'll see." He grinned.</p> <p>I moved my fingers again and I could sense that my heart was racing and my stomach was fluttering. I couldn't stop trembling as I slid the fingers inside of me and pushed them in and out while rubbing my pussy lips with my thumb.</p> <p>"You'll see."</p> <p>He kept on rubbing me, his fingers sliding over my opening as his mouth moved over me. I felt like I was going to fall over, but there wasn't even that. His lips moved over me and my head fell back as he licked me, and I felt my pussy give my pussy more, and even a small, but satisfying, vibration went through me. He was humming to himself and he felt me squeeze his fingers, and when he did, I could sense it in him and it was electric.</p> <p>I looked down to see his tongue and fingers in my pussy, and I couldn't hold on anymore. I wanted to feel them inside me, like his big ones. The feel of them pushed me so completely and it was all consuming. I felt something that I thought my body knew, as it had always done to me, or I had known as long as I could, but my body wanted it so much it just kept pressing me harder. I was going the entire length of my body as I felt my hips pushing against his mouth and felt the vibrations as they started.</p> <p>I opened my eyes in an effort to look at him, but couldn't because he was moving, and with the others. I opened them again and saw what he was looking at and it was me. I felt him on me as he moved his hand to move over my nipples as I slid my legs over his hand while his mouth played over my pussy. My eyes closed as he rubbed me softly, and when I opened them again, he was moving again. I let out little yelps as I felt something inside of me, and as he touched me, his eyes locked on mine. I turned my head away from him to face the ceiling as his lips went back to kissing me then and when my eyes closed against a pleasure to be so close to me, his tongue entered my mouth. I felt him there, touching me, and moving his tongue between my lips as I opened my mouth to him. His tongue entered me again and we made our first contact, his hand still rubbing me gently.</p> <p>He was moving his hand between my legs as his other went under me, my body being pushed against his hand. His fingers felt like little fingers and I felt it inside of me, and as far as I could tell, he was touching it. My body was on fire and I felt like I was going to fall into the abyss if he did it.</p> <p>I felt him open my legs and his head went between them. I didn't know what he wanted from me and I didn't care. I was feeling the ecstasy he experienced and what it was, and it was amazing, like I could do anything with it and I wanted it to happen. He moved his face up against my pussy, the lips of me open as he went in and then his mouth went back to my pussy. He pushed his tongue inside and moved it around as I felt him lapping on my pussy, and my whole body went rigid as I held on to him. I felt my hips pressing my pussy against his tongue as it went around inside of me and it gave me little shivers.</p> <p>"Do it." I heard him say.</p> <p>"Do what?"</p> <p>"Fuck me with your tongue." I felt him move the hair back and it was his tongue now moving inside of me.</p> <p>I wasn't sure what he meant by what he was doing or who he was going in and out of me, but he pushed his tongue inside of me and he moved it back and forth and I felt my body go numb and everything go numb. I felt like I felt like I was going to be split in half as he licked all the wetness from my body and I felt them on my hands but his tongue went to mine instead and I felt his tongue push against my clit as it was touched all around. I felt like I was being eaten as if it were my own pussy eating, but as he did it, I knew my body was going into overdrive and I wanted to feel him doing that inside of me. He kept on licking my lips and my pussy which was making me crazy. He made me feel like I had never felt before.</p> <p>He was moving hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
