"Please," she repeated. My wife groaned again, but she didn't move. For some reason this was all she needed to hear. His cock was stretching her, and it hurt.</p> <p>"No," I said softly. "Don't move." He complied immediately, sliding his cock just inside her. She was wet - all that juices poured from her. She moved with him as he leaned in to kiss her. I watched. He slipped his hand into her skirt and rubbed her clit.</p> <p>I was standing in the doorway, watching his cock sliding in and out of her. I watched the sweat run down my wife's back. I saw her pull at the ties to the skirt, but at last, she let it drop. It fell, and I saw her feet come up into the air, to take the skirt off the bar. And I was still watching.</p> <p>He pushed his cock deeper, and she gasped and moaned softly as I watched him do it. She was tight. We were watching again - I was jealous like the guys in the movie: too bad it was just her. "Mmm," she moaned, and then, "Oh fuck, David." She started coming, and then pulled her mouth away from his and screamed "Fuck."</p> <p>David let his cock slide out of her. "I want one more," he said to me, as he pulled my wife's panties off and laid her on the bar, his cock in hand. "Please."</p> <p>After what seemed like hours of indecency, and the inevitable consequences, I got up to leave. As I pulled the door shut, I heard David gasp, "Please," and I turned to see my wife, still tied up with her ankles on the bar. "Please," she whispered again. I wanted to stay and get that little moment with this man. I wanted her close, to taste his cock.</p> <p>"Stay!" I yelled after him as I pushed in his direction.</p> <p>"Please," she repeated. "Please, I can't take it. Take me."</p> <p>"You're getting it?" I asked, looking at my wife. She was still tied to the bar, her pussy on her belly, my wife's breasts hanging in between her. "Are you happy?"</p> <p>"Yes," she whispered. "I can't take it." I moved over to where they were tied and stood in front of her "And it's over," I whispered, and then walked around to her face. "Are you ready?"</p> <p>"Yes," she answered. "Please."</p> <p>I kneeled before her and wrapped my fingers around and under the chain. "Do you want to stop?" I whispered. She didn't speak. I ran my tongue back down the side of her throat, and down to the edge of her breasts. She groaned, and I felt her body tremble slightly. After a couple of minutes, I got back to my feet and began to untie her feet. By this point, I was getting extremely turned on. I untied her hands and feet first, and then ran my tongue down her legs, and to her feet. She was wet, and as I did, the scent of her sex, combined with the smell of her juices ran into my nose, and I felt the beginnings of my cock stiffen in my pants. When she felt me standing there beside her, she looked up at me, and I smiled at her. "I'm going," I said simply.</p> <p>David was kneeling next to her. "I'll be right back," I thought as I walked to the back, past the bar to another door I had no idea where we had left it and went. I took my time, and checked out. I watched as I walked, and got more nervous. I had a feeling that this was going to involve someone other than the bartender, and it was making me even more aroused than I had been.</p> <p>When I got back to them, they were already naked. One of them was sitting on the floor, still in only his briefs, while the other one was leaning against the bar, his cock in hand stroking it. It was obviously the other one's favorite position. The way they were sitting, her ass to him, there was no way he could be behind her, but I wasn't so sure. He was in the middle, and she was bent over the bar, his back to the other one.</p> <p>"Now," I said to him as I approached, "I want you to tell me what they think. I want to know how you feel about you and the whole thing. And I'll even call them into it. I'm pretty sure it's not anything that you'd really enjoy. I don't know you like it.
