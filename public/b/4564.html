Are you having fun?"</p> <p>"Oh yes. How have you been?"</p> <p>"I was nervous and scared. He made me feel safe and warm so when I came back I was ready to be with you."</p> <p>"I am so glad I found you, Sweet Cheeks."</p> <p>My aunt continued, "He taught me a lot about life's most difficult times. It doesn't hurt that many of those times I have trouble getting it in.</p> <p>"Oh. I am having trouble talking."</p> <p>"Sorry. We have to keep talking."</p> <p>"You're right, I'm sorry. I was getting nervous as I did tell you about how I felt."</p> <p>"That's okay. It isn't my place to tell you how much you mean to me."</p> <p>With that, my aunt pulled the blanket over me and hugged me. That put me very close to her. I could feel my aunt's warm body pressing to mine with each breath I took.</p> <p>After a good five minutes we were both done talking. My aunt and I went upstairs leaving the two of us alone. I wanted to say I had been glad for the meeting but didn't, and that I had been very happy that she was my aunt. The first thing I heard came from my aunt.</p> <p>"So tell me."</p> <p>I looked up and saw my aunt standing above me. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. She didn't smile.</p> <p>"I am going to show you."</p> <p>She lowered herself to her knees and took my now semi-hard penis in her hands. She was still very beautiful.</p> <p>"Oh. You didn't say yes."</p> <p>I could feel my mother's soft wet hand on my ass. She was caressing my butt. As she stroked me, she kissed my ear, licking it, and running her tongue along my ear lobe.</p> <p>"God! Don't stop. You feel so good in my hands."</p> <p>After several minutes, the only sound was our breathing. When she finally lowered her lips and I felt a moist breeze from her mouth I could not believe I had the nerve to say no. She was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. I could not believe my mind could come up with a coherent thought when I had only heard my mother.</p> <p>My aunt's tongue was licking at the pre-cum that was on my head. I could already feel my body respond to her caressing my member. My eyes closed and my head moved up and down.</p> <p>My aunt took my cock into her mouth and held it while she slowly slid her lips up and down. My hips bucked. I wanted to shoot off but could not.</p> <p>My aunt stroked me slowly until I started to shoot into her mouth. I came like a fountain. I never felt anything like that. I didn't care if the semen was on its way down my mother's throat. I had no doubt that her sucking me brought her mother out of her submissive world. I don't know how that happened but both mother and daughter had their climaxes. I knew I came in my mother's mouth.</p> <p>When my orgasm started to subside, I couldn't move. My aunt's fingers had a death grip on my cock squeezing it away. I kept cumming and came, filling her mouth with spurt after spurt.</p> <p>I was spent, exhausted, and still feeling as if I had been shot a dozen times or more. I was not sure if the first time with them, when I first experienced lesbianism, was a success but had not been since I had seen them.</p> <p>The warm and passionate feeling of her mouth on my cock was a shock in itself. I knew it meant I had never been with a woman before. I also knew what her sex looked like. It did not feel like mine. I didn't even care. I was enjoying the attention of my aunt's mouth on me. Now it was time for me to join in the fun.</p> <p>I pulled my aunt up to her feet and held her. I caressed her body, trying to feel the softness of her skin. She responded to my touches by rubbing herself against my hand and arm. I touched her face, ran my finger across her lips. I could feel every ridge of her skin and the softness of her mouth on my fingers.</p> <p>When we broke off from such pleasure, I had to ask. "Are you ready for more?" She nodded.</p> <p>"Now, what's wrong?"</p> <p>"You are very beautiful and I want more." Her words were a bit different than my mother's.</p> <p>"Okay. I understand."</p> <p>"Good. I want to make you feel as good as your motherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
