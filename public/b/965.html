She won't let you touch her," his eyes were wide.</p> <p>"I know she won't. Even if she was as hot as she looks."</p> <p>"No, she wouldn't."</p> <p>"You're such a perv," his eyes went back to her tits, "If you touch one again it'll make my pussy cream."</p> <p>"I was just kidding. Just give me the phone," she reached out a delicate hand, brushing his hand away, "I'm not even the best actress."</p> <p>"That's a lie. I think you'll find me hot. I'm just talking to my mom, remember."</p> <p>"Yeah. I remember, but I don't think it's just the phone."</p> <p>"I was just teasing. I really thought you would like to see it. I was just thinking how lucky you are to have the woman he loves!" She laughed, "Are you sure, because it isn't like those movies."</p> <p>He laughed, "Actually, she's great! I love to watch her."</p> <p>"Do you have a video," his hands suddenly went between her legs, she pushed down on his hand.</p> <p>"You don't have to do anything. I'm a virgin. If I'm not, I'll never let you."</p> <p>"You might. I promise."</p> <p>"Thanks for letting me in on the secret," she gave him a soft smile, "This is fun."</p> <p>********************</p> <p>Lydia was sitting next to her mother as they waited to see what would happen. A few minutes before the first call she had put a stop to all her talk about what happen when it happened.</p> <p>"What did you say he's coming?" asked Lydia, she turned to look at her mother, "You're not so quiet, are you?"</p> <p>"No, no. We were talking about what happened," her mother looked down at her hands, "I didn't say anything. If I'm late, then I'm late. I didn't think that was the right thing to say."</p> <p>"How come you haven't talked much about it?"</p> <p>"If you want me to, I haven't been talking much. I just keep thinking I shouldn't talk. You know, the other day, I found out I was pregnant again."</p> <p>"I don't think you were in a bad way, I just..."</p> <p>"I don't think we got on in the relationship. I think all we have is casual. I don't have the right, that's a start, I'm a virgin. We're a family; I have to deal with it."</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she gave her mother a pouty look.</p> <p>Lydia turned her head away from her mother, and looked up at the street. "Why did you even call me?" she smiled, "He always says that when he comes, it's him."</p> <p>"You have to call," her mother took her mom's face in her hands, and gave it a little squeeze, "I have to, it's what you should do."</p> <p>"Okay, I call, but I'm here."</p> <p>"No, no. I'm going to the doctor, I have to do the tests, and I need you here."</p> <p>"It's like that," her mom said, "I can't think why we are having this conversation."</p> <p>"I'm just trying to cheer you up," she looked away.</p> <p>"I'll do what I can for you," her mother smiled, "That's it, that's all I have to do for now. I'll be right back."</p> <p>"Okay," she took her mothers' hand and walked towards the front door."</p> <p>"What's wrong?"</p> <p>"Your father is coming?" she looked at her father, her father walked back to go into the living room.</p> <p>"Dad is gone," she looked over at him, "Just wanted to give him a little something."</p> <p>He looked at her with a perplexed look, "Well I guess you won't be staying for long, after all."</p> <p>"No," her mother smiled, "I was actually thinking of having another weekend. He won't be back for a week or so."</p> <p>"How long till I get home?"</p> <p>"When do you need to come home?"</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she handed her mother the baby.</p> <p>"Sorry, what's wrong with you?"</p> <p>"Nothing. It's just that my father will be home for another couple years."</p> <p>"Okay. Do what you need to do. I'll just text him and let him know you're coming. I really enjoy the time I'm alone with you."</p> <p>"Oh, okay," her mother smiledâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
