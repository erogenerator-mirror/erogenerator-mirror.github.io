Not that it really helped now, but she knew it would not last forever and she certainly didn't want to hurt him.</p> <p>"Well, now it's my turn you know."</p> <p>"You mean the show," Gina retorted, her eyes looking up to see his expression.</p> <p>"Well, I never felt quite so naked as I do right now." Scott nodded his head in agreement. "But it's still the show, and the more we see you, the better it will look."</p> <p>"Ok. I think that's what I should do." Scott was starting to get a little nervous about the whole dare thing, and Gina had just told him to be naked. He was still a little nervous about her being naked in front of him, but he wasn't going to stop now. Before he knew it, Scott was pulling Gina into him, the warmth they had felt when they made love and the feeling of their naked bodies against each other, even in their own home, was pushing Scott crazy. They kissed, tasting each other's mouths for a moment, and then Scott started to kiss down the full length of Gina's neck, nibbling lightly at her earlobe as his hand moved down her side to cup and stroke her ass.</p> <p>"I'm ready." Scott didn't wait for Gina to say anything further, he started kissing down to her breast, feeling the soft, smooth globe there under his lips before his hand began to caress her other breast. He gently squeezed both of her breasts through the material of her top as she let out a moan.</p> <p>Gina moaned again as Scott's tongue licked up and down her nipple, making it hard under his touch, and her nipple was instantly becoming erect under his touch. He moved her top down so that it covered her breasts, and then moved his hand to her other side and cupped both as his hands stroked her breasts. Scott started to kiss her nipple, working his way around to her other breast, and Gina started to work them both into his mouth as he sucked her breasts, massaging them and biting the nipples softly.</p> <p>"Oh, Scott. I've wanted this this way for so long, and I'm never going to get to feel you inside of me." Scott pulled away from Gina's breasts to kiss down her stomach before reaching down to cup and caress her pussy with his hand.</p> <p>"Let me do that for you." Scott's hands had come up to stroke Gina's shaved mound through her shorts, and then he let go and slipped his fingers into the elastic of her shorts and slipped a couple of fingers gently into her. Gina was dripping, and his fingers felt so good stroking her. Scott looked into her eyes as his hand continued to caress her pussy. He kissed down the inside of her thigh now, moving to caress and kiss up closer to her pussy. Scott's mouth was starting to ache a bit from his fingers inside of her, so he parted her lips and licked her with his tongue, feeling her shudder and shudder with pleasure, as her hands moved to hold his head to her. Scott moved down to lick her sweet-tasting pussy, sliding his tongue in and out of her as her hips moved to meet his touch. He was so close to her as her hands held his head, and his tongue stroked inside of her, sending feelings of pleasure through her body. She was close to cumming now, and her moans and groans were becoming louder and louder. Scott pulled away from her and stood up.</p> <p>"Gina," he said softly, "Let me finish my strip show for you." Scott lifted a leg in the chair, and lowered his shorts and boxers. As his shorts and boxers fell to pool at his ankles, he was naked as well, and his cock and balls were still standing tall and proud. He moved around to stand behind Gina, and placed his cock between her legs, rubbing the head over and around her pussy lips as his other hand continued to caress her breasts and pinch her nipples. In that position, Scott could look down and watch the head as he continued to tease her pussy. He could tell that she loved it when he would dip his head in the middle of her wet slit, and then come back into his mouth for her to suck off his saliva and her natural lubrication. He moved his cock slowly down to her wet pussy and placed the tip of his rock-hard cock between her outer lips.</p> <p>"Are you ready?" Scott asked softly. Gina nodded, and he could see just the side of her lips as he slipped in.
