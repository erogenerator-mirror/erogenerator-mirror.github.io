Yes, I am very, very pleased with what you have done with the dress."</p> <p>Sam turned around and grabbed her handbag, taking out a few extra buttons on the top. He handed it back to her, then grabbed the dress bag and stepped back to let her take it back to the changing rooms. As they went through the door, the girl turned around to face him, smiling with obvious appreciation.</p> <p>"Thank you, he said quietly, leaning in to put his arms around her.</p> <p>"Thank you, he said quietly back to her, a hint of a laugh in his voice.</p> <p>The girl seemed to smile too, but only for a moment before she pulled away from him, returning his arms with a little more confidence than she had in a very long time.</p> <p>"Thank you, for everything, Sam. You have made me extremely happy."</p> <p>"I'm very pleased yourself," he replied. Looking around the shop, Sam saw it looked about the same, which meant that someone had been out shopping there last night.</p> <p>Taking the dress bag out of her hands, he held it out to her, motioning for her to take it.</p> <p>"No, I want to try it on," he told her, turning around as he did so.</p> <p>"I thought so. I've always been afraid you would not want me, you know, and you know I do."</p> <p>"Oh, yes. I'm sorry if that makes you uncomfortable, but I understand. It gives you the option of dressing as I please."</p> <p>"I guess," she told him. And with that said, he turned and walked back out of the boutique.</p> <p>Getting down to the back of the shop, he took a look around and said, "Come back again in one half hour, I'll make lunch. The customer service will be a little more in store when you get here."</p> <p>"Yes, sir," she called out.</p> <p>The girl turned around, then said, "So, how many times did you do this at once?"</p> <p>"Yes, five times. I could do something similar."</p> <p>"Okay, I'll remember that, just don't get in any serious trouble. Your customer service will have to wait until now, and the customer will just be glad that you did it for me."</p> <p>The girl was not smiling, but seemed to be looking from Sam to the girl, grinning back at her. Sam was a bit taken aback, but the way she was looking at Sam, he decided to play along.</p> <p>"There now. Let's go."</p> <p>As they walked up to the main part of the shop, Sam stopped behind the wall. He started to get up and the girl stood, looking at him, then he continued.</p> <p>"Would you like to try a different dress?"</p> <p>"Certainly! If you can do that for free, then I'll try it on."</p> <p>"Yes, of course, I will," the girl replied.</p> <p>As Sam had hoped, he bought a new white pair of trousers and a black sweater, the shirt being black, but not as tight. He looked at them, smiled, and said,</p> <p>"Well, this is going to be a special item, aren't I?"</p> <p>She smiled back, nodded her understanding and said, "Please call me, Sam."</p> <p>"Okay." He watched as she walked away and headed for the changing room.</p> <p>When he had finished with the clothes for today, Sam took the time to look around a little. He found that it was very difficult to find anything in the fitting rooms. The one that looked after fitting his clothes and had a door at the end, for anyone taking an extra step up out of the changing room could only have done it in about ten minutes. Luckily for Sam, there was one in the back of the shop. He watched a couple of women changing in what looked like the ladies changing room, then stepped up to the door, checking the door was still open.</p> <p>"I'm actually going to have to leave the girls, but I don't have a problem with that. I guess I'd better go and talk to them."</p> <p>He turned and began pulling the back of the short dress off of his shoulders, then he said,</p> <p>"Look, have a good time, Sam."</p> <p>"Oh, I will.
