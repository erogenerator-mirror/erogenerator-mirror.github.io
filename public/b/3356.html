Please put your finger in me. Put it all in and suck. It feels so nice."</p> <p>I slowly put my middle finger back into her vagina. Her pussy lips were getting tighter. The muscles and walls were contracting on my fingers. Her hands wrapped around my head. Her breathing began to quicken. After I fingered her all around her vagina started to throb. Her lips tightened and became even tighter. Her whole body began to shake and her face became red and blotchy. It got even more red with her juices. Her face turned a bright red.</p> <p>I kept fingering her as her pussy slowly gushed juice. It got even more wet and hot inside her vagina. Her body moved and shivered. The muscles in her body went out of control. She started to cry out. A sob escaped.</p> <p>Her body shook and shivered. And then she shuddered and shook her body. It was as though every muscle of her body was spasming and shaking as if a machine was controlling her. Her mouth opened and closed in a silent scream.</p> <p>I took a couple of steps back and stood back next to her. The spasms continued. Her body continued to shake. They went on and on. Her body was aching and tired. I pulled my fingers out of her vagina and gave her one last lick.</p> <p>She took a deep breath and then took a couple of deep breaths. Her upper body was still trembling and shaking. The blood seemed to be pulsing in her muscles, too. I saw tears streaming out of her eyes. Her lower body was trembling in pain. I put her into my lap and told her to lie down.</p> <p>She started to sit up slowly and was shaking. There was still some blood still on her lower body. She got down slowly on the floor and started to sit down again. She looked over at me. "What's that? Is all that what took you so long because of this."</p> <p>"Yes, it was that," I lied.</p> <p>"Where did all this come from?"</p> <p>"Oh, that's right," I said. "That's how it started and started. I did it from the moment of conception. When my father was killed."</p> <p>"My dad was killed too," she added, "He was on a bike."</p> <p>"No, not that, too, but it's a story. I've told you about everything."</p> <p>"Oh, you do too," she agreed. "The way I feel about you is more than you really know. Maybe even more than I can say from a man who has just been killed. And when I saw you, I felt a bit guilty."</p> <p>I nodded for her to tell me the other story. I put my hand to her shoulder and pushed her down a bit. "It's alright now," I said soothingly.</p> <p>I hugged her and rubbed her shoulders and her back. I started caressing and massaging her back, shoulders and her buttocks. She turned and put her face in my stomach and kept saying and saying. "I'm sorry about last night, and all the times I'm thinking this day, it's all right for me to do whatever I want."</p> <p>"Don't you feel bad about it? Isn't that your fault?"</p> <p>"Yes," she said.</p> <p>"Then what will happen if I don't do anything?"</p> <p>"What's wrong?"</p> <p>"This is for you. I like you; I love you. I'm not a whore. I'm a loving person, remember?"</p> <p>"You are," she kissed me on my lips. "So are you; I love you."</p> <p>"I love you too, and I wanted to be with you forever."</p> <p>I pushed my lips back and smiled.</p> <p>Suddenly, I felt embarrassed. I never felt any guilt towards either of us. If I wanted her to love me, that would be a great thing. That's what love is all about, isn't it? After I got madder and madder at her, there was no point to this any more. I wanted to spend the entire summer with her. I'm such a romantic!</p> <p>I hugged her tight and continued to caress her shoulders and her back. With my face pressed into her neck, I pushed my hips against her bum, which felt warm and sweaty. The sweat was nice and she smelled just like a woman. Her body was trembling and shivering.</p> <p>"It must be very hot in the morning," she said when she regained control of her body.</p> <p>"Yes, it is a bit, but also, I think, warm, inside," I said.</p> <p>"Please, it feels very good to me. I like it very much."</p> <p>"And we'llâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
