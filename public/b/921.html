"At least, I think it does for you now."</p> <p>She grinned. "I don't know," she replied. "It's still not too bad at all? Or is it just a little bit sore at this point?"</p> <p>I just grinned. "I'm so damn lucky to have you to guide me like this, but I still feel like I should be giving up all this control over things for you. Now, if you would like...?"</p> <p>She laughed again. "I would certainly love to be your guide. I don't suppose you would mind a little fun first? I've got more than a little time to do what you have to do!" She said and smiled at me. Her face was serious. She took my hand and led me up a flight of stairs. A huge smile spread across my face and I felt so good.</p> <p>We got to the end of the hallway and I saw the master bathroom. It was on the other side of the hallway and opened into an area that looked like a small dining room. A sink, toilet and a shower was on one shelf. There was a large mirror at one end. There were curtains pulled back on the windows and the whole place was painted in deep red. There were large glass doors.</p> <p>"Wow, this is amazing!" I told her when we entered.</p> <p>"Thank you, Master," she said. "I'll be right in. Come get in and join me."</p> <p>I turned and smiled at her. There was a large bathroom attached to the whole area. In it was a shower of glass, mirrors and racks of clothes. On one of the racks there were different kinds of towels, lathering things, soap, shampoo, makeup and a full-length mirror. A huge mirror hung on one wall. A door opened to a huge walk-in closet on the opposite side of the room.</p> <p>We both went into it and I closed the door behind us immediately. I stepped in the shower and took off my shoes as she closed the door. She moved forward and wrapped me in her arms. "Mmmm, you are so strong, young master," she purred into my ear. "Do you like me like this?" she whispered.</p> <p>I kissed the top of her head, running my fingers through her hair. "Oh, I like your hair very much! I haven't been able to think of anything like this in years." I leaned forward and gave her a peck on the lips. I then took those beautiful locks of hair in my hand and leaned in with my nose to her ear. "I can't tell you what that feels like, but it looks so fantastic in here." I kissed it over and over again. Then I pressed my lips against her jawline.</p> <p>She moaned, leaning forward and kissing me again. I kept kissing her as she began to moan more and more. I opened myself completely to her. She had to feel the heat of my manhood against her and her own pussy. She lifted herself up and we traded our kisses all over each other's face. "Master, I hope we aren't going to take too long because I want to make love with you before I fuck you!" She whispered.</p> <p>"Well, sure but we have a long way to go yet," I said. "And we don't want to rush this with too much foreplay. It takes time"</p> <p>"And you'll save it for later. But right now, we have a choice!" she replied and took the showerhead from me. She began to work the showerhead on my body, moving the hose as she worked.</p> <p>"Okay, that does sound very good. And do you know what else?" she asked. "I want you to fuck me with that shower head." I had heard of that many times and now the possibilities of what I had planned for her were very exciting.</p> <p>"Oh, sure, but we really have to hurry!" I replied and kissed her again, pressing my lips firmly onto hers and running the showerhead up and down over her back a little. After washing her long hair I kissed my way down to her gorgeous breasts and kissed the undersides, teasing her nipples with my tongue. I could see her breathing quicken as my mouth moved closer and closer to her pussy. She stopped me with a hand and held my head steady while she guided it up to her. I was kneeling in the shower with her legs opened and spread in front of me. As soon as my lips touched the wet skin I was immediately over her and my face was in her pussy.</p> <p>"Oh Master!" she moaned, as she had been. "Yes, yes, oh, my Master, do me! I want to cumâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
