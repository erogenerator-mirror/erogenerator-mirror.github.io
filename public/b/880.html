You can't!! We just met!" she cried tears of frustration but also frustration. Then she stopped moving and tried to look me in the eye again; "Oooooh, you! You! You, you, it feels like I'm falling into your arms! You're crushing me!"</p> <p>"But," I said, turning the key to the ignition to turn off and then turned the key and backed it off. "This might be our last time," my voice took on a more playful tone, "before the day is over."</p> <p>I pulled out of the parking area and headed toward my rental. She pulled her left leg over mine to get better leverage. As she did that, she leaned back slightly and began to move against me, rubbing against me, rubbing a little faster, until she was grinding her hips against mine, rubbing it against me. I put my arms around her and held her tightly as her hands moved over me, kneading at my body, sliding her fingers up and down my spine, then up between my shoulder blades, then up to lightly pull at my nipples.</p> <p>She gasped as I touched her, then turned in my arms and leaned her whole body as she began grinding her hips against my cock, again, trying to drive me deeper inside her and wanting to cum again, but knowing I would just lose control like this. Finally, she stopped trying to pull away. I kissed her neck and she turned slightly toward me. We kissed deeply for a minute or so. Then she broke the kiss and looked at me. She looked me over, her eyes lingering just above my face, and said softly, "Will you fuck me?" I nodded almost imperceptibly. "Then I will tell you what I have to do," I answered quietly.</p> <p>That's when I had to pull back. We sat there in silence for a while, I was watching her from behind as the sun was just beginning to come up over the water and she was looking up toward the sky with a half smile and half look of shock on her face. I wanted her inside me right then, and she could have done more. I was still holding her close. "I'm sorry," she whispered. She looked at the side mirror. "It's not a problem, I just don't know how. I don't know how I can explain this. I don't know how to tell you that we can't do this, that we can't talk about what we have done that I am not even aware of as a couple. I have to tell you that this has to stay."</p> <p>I leaned down and started kissing her lightly at first, then a little harder. It was a lot more intense than I had expected. Her skin was softer and softer than I had imagined, and I could feel her nipples and her abdomen moving back and forth against mine each time our hips touched. I kissed her forehead as we sat there looking into each others' eyes. "I just want to keep doing this," She told me with a small sigh as I reached around and grabbed each of her ass cheeks gently in my hands and said, "and it's good for you to know that you can do it."</p> <p>After I released her backside to grab her legs and lift them onto my shoulders, I had her move toward me and sit on the bed next to us. I had to get on my knees behind her again to get my face at her and she pushed my shoulders down so I could kiss her on the neck. She leaned back slightly so I could get a better angle at her neck again, and then, without me saying a word, she began licking and kissing and biting my neck from behind, running her hand around my waist and pulling me toward her as she did so.</p> <p>She was leaning a little backwards against the headboard of my recliner while she went down on me, sliding herself into a position where she was able to lick both of us and then begin licking my shaft and base as she rubbed it against her face, working her tongue over every vein and curve to test for anything else. She licked and rubbed and sucked and licked as I gently pushed her up to try and suck her nipple hard as she licked and rubbed her head against me. Then she stopped and kissed her way up to my neck and began licking and nicking at my ear. I didn't know what to do but as she started tonguing my earlobe, it began to feel good and I began to press her body slightly back against me, trying to get more of my weight on her, but she was pushing back and I couldn't really move enough to keep her. She continued kissing and licking her way toward kissing my ear and neck, up to my face and finally to my lips and again I kissed her lightly on the lips and said, "Wait." I pulled her back and she looked at me, her eyes half closed and seemed to be half out ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
