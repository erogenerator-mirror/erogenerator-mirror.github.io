Mmmmmm, when she was a little girl and her mother always called her 'Honey' when she saw me. She loved my 'honey's' but this morning my darling was in danger of being too early in the morning. She'd already taken one look at me and realized it was a mistake. I don't think a couple of years of being a virgin was going to change that! As we were sitting near the river, sitting on a log, we didn't stop talking about how we each looked and when we had to go inside to shower. Of course, the thought of being in the shower with a beautiful woman made my heart sing.</p> <p>After what seemed like an hour, our conversation got quiet around me. She said, "Let's get some breakfast before we get caught by the folks."</p> <p>"OK, I see, I'm all ears."</p> <p>"And I thought that I was the only one?" Her voice was a little breathy as she spoke.</p> <p>"Yeah, it's your fault we're here." I felt my cock stiffening under her fingers.</p> <p>"You're just going along with it," she giggled.</p> <p>"No, I'm just going along with it because it's exciting."</p> <p>"Oh, it's exciting. Now let's not get carried away. We're going to get breakfast and relax. Why don't we go down to the kitchen and start this." Molly walked with me down the path to the cabin. I was a little anxious that this woman wanted me to keep our conversation on the back burner but at the same time, I liked the look she gave me. I like having fun, even if I'm afraid to admit it.</p> <p>We walked into the kitchen then and I sat a chair in front of the big island. Molly dropped a bagel and a bagel sandwich and a couple slices of omelet in a bagel and stood there, looking at our breakfast. She pulled my chair back away from the island and began to nibble some of her food. From her bagel and sandwich it was quite a feast. The omelet was actually a lot bigger than I was going for now, but, in my case, I was hungry too. Mmmmm, I love the idea of making these omelet sandwiches. I was getting a little sleepy too so I went to the window to look out over the lake. There was lightening and lightning. The moonlight was bright reflecting off the sky. On the other side of the cabin was a log. Not really a cabin, it had to have been on top of the house. Molly took a seat at the log and we got to eating our omelets. I was really hungry now, but I think her mind was in some sort of turmoil and she was still trying to convince herself that we were still having a good time. We just kept talking about different things as we ate, about my job, my college, and about our spouses for sex play, my favorite books, and what they were up to on the computer. There were some good points but they weren't as important as the good points we had now about being in public together for a couple of hours.</p> <p>I couldn't get out of it. We finished our omelet and then we sat there eating our omelet. She put her bagel in front of me and asked, "Do you want to continue talking like that?"</p> <p>"Well, you were right the night before about that wonderful thing between my legs last night. I had a wonderful day and I had an even better sex drive, you know!"</p> <p>"We are having sex?"</p> <p>"Yes, we are having sex!"</p> <p>"Good. It's about time you learned some of the things my mouth, pussy and tongue were capable of, you know." She just gave me a grin. "Don't you think we should talk about all that this morning, right here, right now?"</p> <p>I did feel like I would rather be in an awkward position about my morning activities by now. I said, "Yeah, it's pretty damn important. The others weren't doing anything in particular, they were just passing through here like they were going to be a couple. We have to talk about this if we're going to keep this a secret."</p> <p>"I know, but I really want to get to know you better, don't you?"</p> <p>"I do, too."</p> <p>I was nervous about how we were going to get our secrets out of the house and I wanted to wait until she was ready to tell me. I was hoping we could keep our private stuff to ourselves; we just knew there were peopleâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
