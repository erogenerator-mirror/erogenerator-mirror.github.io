"Yes, you were right, you are very beautiful. I had a hard time taking your clothes off when you walked out, but this... This body, this is very beautiful."</p> <p>She stood there as he looked it over. "I... I've never had a man..." she blushed and stammered, "Never..." she whispered, then stopped, the realization of what she had said sinking in.</p> <p>He leaned over and kissed her lightly on her neck. "Do you see how beautiful it is, I mean you know my cock gets hard a lot."</p> <p>Shaking her head, "I, how... "</p> <p>"I can see what you mean," he finished her sentence, "he's a virgin, I mean he's been with women, but I... but your body is like, wow, wow... I never knew it could come so smoothly. You are so beautiful and sex is... oh, this is so naughty...I'm going to... " he smiled and held her close, he could feel her breath on his chest, and he knew this time with her was all a dream; not just a date night, but... the night of love and passion she had with the real thing.</p> <p>"We should not..." he said. "I shouldn't... I shouldn't be doing this, please... "</p> <p></p> <p>He had just gotten out from her house and was getting dressed, when she spoke up again. "How about you, are you really that big?" he said in shock.</p> <p>He looked down to see his erection poking out at her. She giggled and then reached out and grabbed his cock. "I always wanted a man when I was a little girl," she said, still looking at his cock, then leaned in for an even deeper kiss.</p> <p>She put her hand under his and squeezed his erection hard. "Ohh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to..."</p> <p>"Shush, I know you meant to, you just don't know," he said, then kissed her again.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I just..." she blushed again as he broke the kiss.</p> <p>"I have to have some more of your body, okay?" he said.</p> <p>She looked at him like he was crazy. "Sure," she said and pulled him over to the bed and sat him. He laid down and she fell on him. They kissed as she reached for his penis again, and then she ran her hand all over it.</p> <p>"You shouldn't..." he said.</p> <p>"I shouldn't do," she said, "I shouldn't, what if... what would... my husband... it doesn't matter... it's all right..." She kissed the head, then leaned down and took him into her mouth, and it turned in her hand to its tip. A thrill of pleasure shot to his balls as she slid her mouth over him, and then began to work up his organ. She cupped his balls and took one then the other into her mouth and sucked. Then she opened her eyes and was at once surprised, excited, and then turned her gaze to his face.</p> <p>"Oh, my," she said.</p> <p>"I think you like it, it feels weird but... Oh wow, yes, like no..." he moaned, as she slid her tongue around the head of his cock again, and she wrapped her lips over it, as slowly as she could. She took it deeper within, then slid it back out. As she did this, she held it with her lips and took him back in her mouth. It seemed like a long time. He could feel his balls tighten and his cock begin to twitch.</p> <p>"That felt good," he said.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she said, "I'm just not ready yet." She stood up, and then dropped her pajama pants and panties to the floor. Then she climbed into the bed, lay between the other two and kissed him. "I think I like you, more. I, I do want to do something with you, but I don't want you just having sex, because you might want me too. I don't," she said with a laugh.</p> <p>He reached out to her thigh and felt that little patch as she lifted her hip. "I don't have time, I'll be back in a minute," he said, then he stood up.</p> <p>"Okay," she said, "and I love you." She kissed him on the lips as she sat up, then looked him in the eyes. "I'll be right back," she said, and then she headed off to the bathroom. She turned on the shower and stepped into it as she felt his warm body enter her, and she wrapped his arms around her and kissed him again.</p> <p>"How about we shower together, Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
