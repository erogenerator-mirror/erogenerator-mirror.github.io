Her voice was soft, but was still firm, as if she was in pain.</p> <p>"It... is," he replied. "Do you mind if I try again? Maybe we could go again, just for practice? And then maybe I would be able to help in some way."</p> <p>"And if you don't?" she asked. She still seemed angry, but not in pain. It was the truth and truth were almost as close to the truth as the words. She still seemed determined to get this thing over with.</p> <p>"I don't know... I suppose. Or I'd be just plain happy, and then you'd be mad at me. That would hurt..." He let the last inane word trail off. "Yeah, I guess that would hurt just a bit."</p> <p>She smiled. She was trying to say something that wasn't exactly, and might offend, her. Maybe it made sense and maybe that would help her win the bet. "Honey, you should really try!" she said. Her hand was on his shoulder now, and she had this smug, even gleeful smile on her face. Her hand had slipped slightly down and was now stroking his chest, then sliding up his side and along his shoulder and onto his shoulder blades, then back down again. She seemed to know that it would help him go over his edge, that his desire would reach critical mass. And in the end, she meant to push his limits a bit. She would let him know where to go from here, so to speak.</p> <p>He didn't notice until his lips brushed a piece of her hair aside and lightly grazed her ears. He tried to be quiet and to be patient.</p> <p>She ran her hands over his shoulders. "I'm sorry. I really hope you don't get hurt. I really do. And you might be tempted, yes, but if you think you might not, well, let's not count on it. Not at all." She leaned in quickly, planting a kiss on his lips then slid her arms around him and put her head on his shoulder instead.</p> <p>He didn't know where this was going, but felt he didn't have to worry about that much if he thought the way she was doing was doing as good a job of it as they both wanted. As he kissed her ear and her neck he had no idea that the feelings he was feeling was actually quite pleasurable. It was as if there was a warm fire there that, once it had been released, could have a life of its own. Her face had never looked this happy before.</p> <p>"You're a good kisser. I've had better so I may as well take advantage of that," he finally admitted as he held her close.</p> <p>"I hope you don't think I'm trying to act all over," she said. She leaned in and kissed him passionately then slid down a bit and kissed him again, this time a little more deeply.</p> <p>"I'm sure you are. But I really mean it. If you want to get up from the couch I mean, you can. I'm sure I will just lay back and let you do whatever you're comfortable with. I can't think of what to do here, though. You can be my partner, but you have to be my partner. And to be honest, if we're in different states I guess, yeah, just relax."</p> <p>"What can I do then?" she asked as she moved up his body and kissed his lips again.</p> <p>"Just sit back for a bit, I think," he told her. She was smiling at him, still in just the tiniest touch of her hand.</p> <p>"Okay then, I'll lay back. It'll probably be good for a little bit," she said. Her face relaxed. She seemed to be able to do what she wanted.</p> <p>So that's how it started. They did what they wanted for the next hour. He lay on his back with her between him and her, and she on top of him. He had one arm wrapped around her back so they were facing each other, and the other hand resting just above his cock. Sometimes she would reach into his pants for the object of her desires.</p> <p>Their bodies were moving slowly. He couldn't really see her as much as he was able, but she was looking at him with a kind of amused expression as they continued to kiss. Sometimes, however, it seemed that she was focused on the man whose arms belonged to her.</p> <p>When she was about to lower herself slowly onto him, her eyes finally left him and looked up to meet his gaze. She smiled at him and moved her mouth toward his. He felt her lips part, and there was a tingling sensation as her tongue went straight between his lips. He felt the wetness of her lipsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
