She insisted with the next words.</p> <p>"More than what?" He asked.</p> <p>"More than anything! Please just do it! I promise, I will do it for you!" She said fervently, feeling her eyes burn with heat.</p> <p>"I suppose you do that for free." He paused. "But I have decided then, this is my last chance."</p> <p>He paused a second in his mind, as he stood there, holding the phone. She still wasn't aware, but he heard the slight hesitation of her fingers, and felt a little trepidation but continued, "It's up to you, but no, I won't." He said flatly.</p> <p>"It's up to me?" She asked.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"What's the offer?"</p> <p>"I will buy."</p> <p>"You will buy?"</p> <p>"No, I won't! Not unless you pay me."</p> <p>"I'll tell no one!"</p> <p>"There's something special if you would give me this!" He handed the phone to her, and she placed the receiver back in its cover.</p> <p>"Okay!" She said quickly. "What do you say?"</p> <p>"Okay!" He answered. "But I'm still selling!"</p> <p>The line went dead, and he stood there for a minute staring at her, as she sat there stunned. Then, he knew.</p> <p>"What's the story? Do you want more?" He asked. She didn't answer, she just nodded her head and then, as he held out the phone again, she spoke it to him.</p> <p>"This is your last chance." He said coldly, so her face flushed again. "How long will you have to wait?"</p> <p>"I have no idea, you have your own rules for this. Maybe even if I had, it would never happen again!" She spat in disbelief.</p> <p>"I won't lie to you." He said gently. "You might just say no."</p> <p>"There are more than just those?" She asked, still in disbelief.</p> <p>"A lot more!" He said, as she continued to stand there shocked. "I am a powerful man, a great businessman."</p> <p>"I don't understand why I'd want to sell your life to him. What does his name stand for? What happens with him, is it anything but, "he smiled coldly at her, but continued, "I give him over to you, and he gets to keep him."</p> <p>"So, you do that?" She asked. "What could he do?"</p> <p>"There are a lot of things we don't tell anyone else!" He replied. "So, if you would give me that phone, I would like to ask you something, before I take it. Anything. You can have the phone and I can have it, can't I?" He nodded then, a strange look of confusion crossing his face.</p> <p>"Okay! Tell me what to do, no one else will do it, I will do it." She said. It did not please him at all, but it did please him even if he could not understand her.</p> <p>"Tell me what to think..." he said softly, as he waited. For a while they were, silent. "Tell me, I mean. When will I pay you? Will you get back your freedom?"</p> <p>"What? Oh, that. Yes! The sooner it can be over I can move on. I haven't been back in a long time or anything. I can move on, if you want to sell me back to you!" She replied.</p> <p>"Well, I don't want my friends to get hurt, so I think you should stay here. I'll get my stuff out, and bring you home. I can take care of it for you. You can call the landlord in the morning and tell him you forgot where you've been and that this was not my fault." The words left his mouth, as was the truth. He could not take any more of these, if he tried to talk her out of this. He would do it, but it was far from the end.</p> <p>"I don't want anything." She said flatly. He stopped and looked her in the eyes.</p> <p>"You won't leave me then!" He said coldly.</p> <p>"You won't even try, you don't understand, I don't want to get hurt..."</p> <p>"Yes, it will hurt." He said, "But I am not going to do anything that will hurt you! You can call it off, I've already taken you home!"</p> <p>"I don't want my friends to get hurt! They got me, they're here!
