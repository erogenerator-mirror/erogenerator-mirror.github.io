With a loud grunt, he buried himself deep into her to the base. Susan was surprised and startled at John's speed; it had never occurred to her that he would be pounding her. But, as John began to thrust, she began to match him. She could feel her pussy start to tighten, getting wetter at the thought of them both coming. A small, soft moan came from Susan as her body began to convulse around John's cock.</p> <p>John growled and thrust a final time before letting his cock pulse and pulse inside her. A few moments later, Susan's entire body relaxed, feeling him sliding out of her. Once she did, he pulled her close against him, kissing her ear.</p> <p>"God, yes, fuck me," Susan murmured. "Fuck me John. Oh, God, I want you to fuck me hard."</p> <p>John nodded then, not sure of what to do. John was a novice and the last thing he wanted was to be caught screwing someone else's wife. He pulled Susan tighter to him, feeling her breasts press into his chest. She was his. He could never be a stranger to her. In the past, they had tried to be discreet, but now that this chance would come he had to give her the sex she wanted.</p> <p>He slowly pulled away from her, leaning against the back of the couch again. He looked at her. Susan looked back at him with a dreamy expression on her face.</p> <p>"Please don't stop," Susan murmured. "I want all of you."</p> <p>John grinned, then. "All?" he asked.</p> <p>Susan looked unsure. Perhaps she misheard herself.</p> <p>"All," John said with a laugh. He sat up and held her tightly against him.</p> <p>Susan grinned back. Maybe, she thought. Maybe, it just meant it was true. Maybe it just meant it had happened.</p> <p>John ran his hand down her back and onto her ass, lifting her off the couch. He held her and pressed her against the door. He rolled them over, then stood back up straight. They had only moved about a full half dozen steps when he felt her trembling and jerked against him, turning around quickly.</p> <p>"Fuck me," she said as her body was suddenly assaulted by a sudden wave of anger, jealousy and guilt as it washed over him.</p> <p>His hand was between her legs and she suddenly felt a sharp pain in it. He slapped her hard against the side of her face.</p> <p>"Do it!" she snapped, but he had already begun to laugh.</p> <p>Her anger had gone, replaced by a wave of fear and confusion as she turned her face up toward him. Tears flowed down her cheeks. He knew how she felt. It had happened. He realized that she had lost control of her emotions and that he had to find a way to protect her from the feelings that had overtaken her. He also realized something else.</p> <p>Susan wasn't a virgin. She was pretty sure she had enjoyed that experience. What Susan wasn't sure about was how much she liked it. She had always loved sex. That was it. That's what John was, to protect her from the sexual feelings that came out of her sexuality. And just a little of it, that little of it just to hurt?</p> <p>"You know what would look better?" John said, holding his hand out to her. She reached out for it and quickly realized he was holding something of her former partner, Michael. The first thought of it was to stop him, but the second thought that this wasn't a good idea brought a smile to her face.</p> <p>"No," she snapped, her fingers shaking.</p> <p>He shook his head. "You're not going anywhere until I tell you that you have to," he explained. "Now, you're going to have to do what I tell you."</p> <p>She looked at him again, suddenly scared of his answer. "What the hell are you talking about?" she demanded. She looked away again and began to giggle. He had never seen her like this. He had never been this close to her like this. There was nothing in that life that she knew she wanted more that he did. Susan couldn't help being turned on. Not this close to him.</p> <p>But, now it was Susan's turn to be terrified, and her expression had quickly changed from one of joy to a little hurt. "Michael," she cried. "Oh, God, tell me. Tell me what was the worst thing about that? Tell me, please."</p> <p>John laughed, feeling a little like he was being caught making fun of something that he had seen a bit of one of his co-workers just tell him. He had certainly done whatever the hell he wanted to do to get the information.
