She lube her hand up, then inserted her index finger past the first joint of her lips. She pushed, slowly, then firmly, then withdrew it to the first joint, then pushed as hard as she could to see the result of that. She repeated it again.</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>She shook her head no. She was still holding her hands high above her head. The whole experience was over; at least it had felt like it had. She'd spent the entire night, in this room, with no intention to lose count of the minutes, hours, or minutes that she'd spent.</p> <p>She looked up to the ceiling and began to sob as she let go. She felt her eyes start to water; this was nothing but misery. She knew at this point that she could never keep this, this, any longer. So she closed her eyes and let her eyes sink in.</p> <p>And just as she was certain she heard a noise, she heard a voice, but only from outside the door for a minute, a tiny little voice. It was the door handle. She pushed herself back from the wall and, still holding her wrists, lifted one leg and then the other to stretch out so she could press them against the wall once again. She leaned her head back as much as the restraints would allow, her knees bent at the knees as she leaned her chest up against the wall. She could hear voices outside and the door.</p> <p>Now she began to sob again.</p> <p>Chapter 11</p> <p>The sound of the door opened was not entirely audible to her. Her eyes were shut tight together at the realization of just how silent she was. But even her own tears were audible to her.</p> <p>Two men were standing in back of her. One was in front, the other in front. They were completely silent. She could feel his eyes appraising the sight of her body. She could hear soft talking and talking. He paused briefly and turned to see her at the front of the room, on the floor and looking over her shoulder at them in concern and anticipation. He stepped back, motioned for her to come over to him and she turned to the wall.</p> <p>One man pulled out a camera. The other held the light gun. The man who had been in the chair had set the camera up to the side of the room. He was pointing it towards the corner. The sound of their voices reached their ears and made her feel like they were right next to her.</p> <p>The man was holding a camera. She was standing there holding her arms over her head as she watched them; she could feel the warm breath of the men on the back of both her arms. Their breath seemed to be slowly and deliberately being caressed in a most intimate way.</p> <p>There was an awkward silence. She was aware that, even before the words came out a hundred miles away, there would be no question of a decision between them.</p> <p>They did not give her any time to decide. The man in the chair pushed the camera toward her and let it trace her as far from her as she wanted it to go. She could feel the soft hairs of a man’s ear against her cheek and thought briefly of a memory where she had been sitting down to eat when there was a strange sound coming through the door. They all knew that she had opened the door, had just come back from dinner in the nude, had seen her friend, and it had all been right there in the kitchen. She opened her eyes and looked down at the camera. The dark shadowed face of a man was in the shot. All she could see was a pair of eyes looking up at her with pleading. She wanted to reach out and run her fingers over the man’s skin; to feel his skin against hers; to hold him close against her as he touched her all over. But she held herself still. She had to try and hold off.</p> <p>The man in the chair began to move the chair about toward the side of the room. She heard a zipper. But what was he doing? She was not used to any of this. The camera was just a thin piece of glass. Was he going to take it out and put it in a bag? Could she feel any moisture? It was an uncomfortable position. She could feel it, too.</p> <p>"What was he going to do? I can’t stand this. Take it out." The man in the chair said.</p> <p>"N-no," came the reply.</p> <p>"N-no," was the response back. "Take it out." The man on his chair moved his weight back until his mouth was directly over the camera and the other two on her arms.
