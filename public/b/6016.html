"There are some real bad women in my world who like to dress up and parade around!"</p> <p>The two friends laughed and exchanged more looks at her. She had always felt very attractive, and had long since lost that effect on most of the women in their life, except maybe to her roommate at the club. That was probably why there was always a nice look in her eyes when they met, to make them feel good about themselves.</p> <p>"How about we dance?" he asked.</p> <p>"What's dancing?" she asked, not moving away from his finger.</p> <p>"Let's dance," he replied.</p> <p>The two friends stepped back, keeping their eyes glued to each other, and took several steps to the left. As soon as they got close enough, the other girl joined them as the music began to pick up as they moved back.</p> <p>"It's so beautiful out there," she cooed. She held his hand as they began to move back and forth, enjoying the view of the other girl dancing in front of them. Their movements were smooth, gentle, fluid, and the girls' expressions became more and more provocative as they watched him, and enjoyed his presence.</p> <p>"This is fun," she told him. "There's this girl with an absolutely gorgeous body and so pretty."</p> <p>"Are you sure you've never seen a guy have a serious girlfriend before?"</p> <p>"Why would you ask that?" she laughed.</p> <p>She stood up, letting her legs come up to her chest as she reached up to him and began to rub her breast in his face. She pressed them into him, feeling his strong hands on her, and leaned right into him as the music changed to a slower, seductive, waltz.</p> <p>As she began to move to the beat, the girls, who had been sitting in their lounge, looked at each other in disbelief at each other's performance.</p> <p>"What the hell?" one of them gasped. "We've never seen him dance before."</p> <p>"It sure is amazing," the other girl giggled. "It's so cool."</p> <p>It was then that he heard his girlfriend, "This is going to be hot!" and they both stepped back to watch him again. He leaned in to her, but she held her eyes shut, turning away from him, and turned to the other girl. "I think that would be fun," she quipped. "I haven't had my eye on him for too long."</p> <p>He took her hand and leaned her down on the dance floor, and then bent down to kiss her. He was still wearing his jacket, but the way his lips met hers, she realized it would probably remain their little secret.</p> <p>"I just know that she'll never be your girlfriend," she smiled, and put her hand on his cheek. "Thank you for showing me a good time."</p> <p>"It was my pleasure," he replied, and then turned his attention back to the girl still dancing.</p> <p>"And this is my other boyfriend," he told her, as he pulled her closer. "He won't be coming to our party as much as us. I think it would be a good time to have a good time as well. I mean, he just came up and said, "Sorry."</p> <p>The girl didn't know what to say or do, as she had just finished the second one. They left his arms around her, and began to dance very close. She felt his large hands come up under her loose top, squeezing her breasts, and rubbing her firm butt against him as the two walked slowly back out on the dance floor.</p> <p>All she could do was grind her ass against his crotch, and imagine what it would be like to be on the other end of the dancer's body as they grind on each other, legs intertwined across the other. It was an odd combination of the two friends, but what the hell, she supposed she would just watch. She felt herself heating up, and began to slide her hips up and down his, letting her nipples rub along his chest and feel his hands run up from her back toward her chest, pushing them up under her bra. She knew it must be affecting him, but he would probably be in agreement with her!</p> <p>He turned her around, and she felt him slide her straps down her body, pulling her breasts down to help him. She pulled off his shirt then, and let his head fall back against the dance floor.</p> <p>The music changed again, and he pulled her back up with him. As the two swayed to the beat, touching each other again, the girls got a bit louder in encouragement.</p> <p>She pulled him down to her so she could slide her own body back against him as they stood next to one another, and began to slide her legs up and down hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
