Her skirt was still a bit shorter than it had been, probably because she hadn't been wearing panties today. She was looking for something that would keep her pussy shaved. The idea that a man wanted more than just a bald pussy was exciting as her legs spread more and wider. I was enjoying watching this, enjoying her in the way she was doing. It took her a few minutes, but she began to really take me by surprise.</p> <p>At one point I started to see why she looked so happy. She kept telling me things like, I'm beautiful, you're sexy, I really love you, thank you." And then, when I'd finished watching her she reached over to me and ran her hand up and down my arm, making my cock stir. It must have been hard for her to keep that up. She was enjoying herself.</p> <p>"You know about girls," I said, moving so I had better leverage. "You've known for a while, right?"</p> <p>She got her answer on the last part, and I heard her smile. She was still smiling as she stroked my cock, a few tears in her eyes.</p> <p>"There is one other thing you're supposed to get for your wedding anniversary?" she asked, wiping her eyes.</p> <p>"How the fuck would I get for my anniversary?" I replied with an almost joking tone. "That's not your anniversary. You don't get it on your anniversary, and you should."</p> <p>"Oh but I think I know what that means," she said, grinning again. "I'm just glad you haven't found out about my anniversary yet, and you can always have it with me, even if you have to be there on my wedding day."</p> <p>This was getting more and more interesting. I was excited and jealous.</p> <p>"Oh, okay, sorry. You know," she said, moving up and then over to me. She ran her hand down his chest, around his neck, on his shoulder, and then down into his lap, feeling his hardness under her hand. Then down to his stomach, to feel his cock through his boxers. I could feel her breath on him.</p> <p>"Here you go," she said, running her hand on his hard stomach. "This won't take long," she said, and then leaned back against the vanity, turning around so she could watch me. I couldn't believe a guy in his early fifties had an eight incher, and it was hard for her to look at me as she stroked him. God it felt great, but she was still smiling for her, and I was wondering how far she'd come. I turned quickly to face the girls, with Mary next to me, her hand stroking my cock.</p> <p>"You know what's going on back there?" she said, as she leaned in just a bit to take me in her mouth. I didn't think I could hold out any longer. I tried to tell myself it was just my imagination, but I knew I was watching my wife with another guy. She was turning me on and he was watching her do it to another guy in her own little world, and I was enjoying every minute of it.</p> <p>"What is it baby?" she asked, grinning. "Have you got a nice big load for me?"</p> <p>I could't take it anymore. "Fuck Mary...now."</p> <p>She sat up and moved between my legs, kissing me softly on the lips. Her nipples were hard as she ground her body against me, her leg brushing mine and getting a bit wet. She smiled sexily and held the head of my cock in her hand.</p> <p>"I've told you before that you can say that and still get a big load of cum."</p> <p>"It's not fair," I said, fighting with the idea of shooting my hot load across her breasts. But something in her eyes said, so I decided to go for it.</p> <p>"Just take care of me," I said. I had a good-sized load waiting for me. I wanted to save it for me, and to give her something to remember her by. But, my pride was winning out. I wanted to give her more than just giving her something to remember me by. My cock started to swell, and suddenly she was between my legs sucking it slowly, then moving her mouth to the head, and up to the base. Then she began to move her mouth up and down, and I was moaning as she gave me one of the best blowjobs I have ever gotten. She moved in perfect timing with my strokes, and I was soon cumming into her mouth, holding her head for support to make sure I didn't lose control. She looked up at me and smiled wickedly.</p> <p>"My turn," I saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
