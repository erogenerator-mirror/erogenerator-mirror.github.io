"I was only kidding."</p> <p>"It wasn't really a joke - you knew he wouldn't try anything else - was it?"</p> <p>"Nah, not funny at all - you just looked and acted like your friends didn't know about you," I said. "If I had known some of her things the second time I wouldn't be able to do this with you at some point."</p> <p>She smiled and took my hand off it.</p> <p>"You want me to do this for you?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, if you like. It's pretty easy if you want to do it," I told her.</p> <p>"That sounds great, but I think I'm going to keep asking myself for some time," she said. "I need to tell you something I need to tell you about myself. It's okay to be with you, right?"</p> <p>"Sure, why don't you wait here and we can talk?"</p> <p>"Okay - see you soon - bye," she said.</p> <p>She left, and I lay on my bed staring at the ceiling. I couldn't even imagine what she had said to me. I had never in my life seen her like this before. I just thought I'd lose an extra person to her.</p> <p>A lot of what I felt in our relationship - and how my life had changed in a matter of seconds. But it wasn't like being with someone else. This was something I was comfortable doing, and seeing her. I found it pretty hard to believe this - not knowing about him, or even knowing about what he wanted of me. That's all I could think about right now - and that's part of it because it took all of my mind.</p> <p>The next morning, I heard the front door open again, and I immediately went out to get the coffee.</p> <p>"How's the coffee?" I asked as I walked back. In the kitchen, she had a small cup with a sugar and cream and had just finished setting my coffee down.</p> <p>"The coffee's good, and I was hoping to spend some time making it, since I saw the paper this morning and it was a nice color."</p> <p>"That's nice of you to have an opinion on something like this," I told her. "I guess the coffee's good, too."</p> <p>The breakfast was just about done. She sat at the table, and sipped her coffee slowly as if she was really making up the cup. I watched the paper and thought if he's really done with his paper work, the coffee might also go in.</p> <p>After a long while had passed, she said "I'm ready for a coffee, too."</p> <p>"How can I be of service to you?" I asked.</p> <p>"I can be of service to you, yes," she replied.</p> <p>"What do you need to buy?" I asked in my best British accent.</p> <p>"Maybe I can help you. Do you need any money for a coffee now, or would you rather have something else?" she asked. "You know if you like it with a little sugar."</p> <p>"I sure did. Want to go for a coffee sometime sometime?" I asked her.</p> <p>"I still haven't found a coffee that's as good with sugar. Do you think it would be a good substitute for your coffee?" she asked me.</p> <p>"Nah, it's good if you like it," I told her. "It might be just what you need."</p> <p>She sat and turned down the newspaper. There was something in her eyes at that moment that I wasn't sure I wanted to know anymore. I was kind of a sucker for her, but this was a small town where there were no fraternities. I was used to all the guys wanting sex for the first date, and I had the feeling she didn't want to go on that first date, either.</p> <p>I wondered if she really was so naive that she would actually give a second date an answer. If she gave one a second thought, and it didn't bother her that many guys liked it and liked it now, how could I understand that? She would give up and be a total asshole. For some reason, she didn't like me.</p> <p>After I finished up breakfast and fixed some coffee, she took the paper over to the refrigerator and got herself some coffee from that cup along with another cup and said. "Let me get your coffee for you."</p> <p>"Oh, okay," I answered. "I'll just go back to my room and take care of my paper," I said.</p> <p>She walked out of the kitchen a few minutes later with a cup. She walked in front of me.</p> <p>"I think you could get us some coffee togetherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
