I replied.</p> <p>"This is what you wanted?" he asked in a low sultry tone.</p> <p>"Yes." I said truthfully.</p> <p>"Then why now?" he asked softly.</p> <p>He pulled my legs up with his arms, and the crotch of my panties fell to the floor. "I don't want you to be afraid of this."</p> <p>"How else am I to protect you." I replied.</p> <p>He looked me up and down and smiled, but he also rubbed up against my breasts. "This is a good plan."</p> <p>I pulled him closer and his lips were on the side of my neck. I could feel his body start to rub against mine. That got my juices going and I could feel myself getting aroused.</p> <p>"We don't have to go into the bedroom." I said, but I knew he would do it this way.</p> <p>I looked up into his eyes but before I could speak he had already kissed me. He had his tongue in my mouth and was massaging the underside of my tits, I pushed my chest forward towards him. He kept the kiss going, but it slowly became deeper and more passionate.</p> <p>He was now squeezing my soft breasts and his other hand was on the front of my panty, I could see that he was already running his fingers down my thighs. I began to feel very wet down there.</p> <p>I lifted my butt up a bit so his hand could go up. I could feel him running his fingers up and down my pussy lips. I moaned lightly. I pulled his head towards me and I felt the heat coming out of him. He slowly inserted a couple finger inside me until he found my hot spot. I could feel my knees starting to buckle. He continued to rub my clit with his thumb for a while and my breath was getting more ragged.</p> <p>"Come and fuck me." I said.</p> <p>His mouth went down and slowly went down on my neck. He slowly licked up to the point where it met my collar bone where he stopped to suck gently on it. He continued to rub my pussy as his tongue came out again.</p> <p>I was moaning louder and louder as I could feel my orgasm begin to approach.</p> <p>He stopped to sit a few feet away looking into my eyes. "We will go to the bedroom now." He said with that devilish grin on his face.</p> <p>He pulled me up to him and kissed me harder. "Do you want to fuck?" I nodded to him. This time I could feel his raging hard-on pressing against my mound again.</p> <p>"Get up." I told him. He got up and I saw him lift his tented boxer briefs and then stand up and drop his shorts. He was fully erect, and standing just a couple feet away.</p> <p>I knelt between his legs and took his hard-on in my hand. "You want to enter me?" I asked. I could feel him shake and tremble against me.</p> <p>"No." He replied.</p> <p>I slowly undid his belt and unbuttoned the buttons to his pants. He didn't seem to care either. I took his soft cock out and licked my lips again. I rubbed it up and down my wet slit, getting all his pre-cum on the way. I could feel that my pussy was dripping wet.</p> <p>With one hand I opened the button up and gently put his cock back in. I put him in me and started to rub myself on him. He started to move his hips back to meet mine. We kept kissing and I felt his cock head pushing his pelvis higher against me.</p> <p>I moved his face and pressed it more firmly against my neck, and I could feel his whole body start to shake. He let out a loud moan from somewhere deep inside me and his balls got heavier with each thrust.</p> <p>I reached a hand under his balls, felt that I had just enough fluid in them to give his cock a nice massage as he was thrusting his body into mine.</p> <p>I started to shake wildly as I climaxed and he came hard.</p> <p>He collapsed against me, but we were still going at it. I couldn't believe the level of pleasure I was experiencing right there. I just pulled him close and fell face down in his arms. He held me hard to him, his arms around my neck.</p> <p>"Good boy."</p> <p>I lay there not knowing how many orgasms I had experienced. I felt him pull away and he rolled me onto my back and went down to kiss me. He was still on top of me, but he wasnâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
