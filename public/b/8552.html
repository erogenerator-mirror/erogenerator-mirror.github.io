"Oh my God!" she screamed, "Fuck me harder!"</p> <p>Kieran's thrusting intensified as his balls began to ache and pulse. Pushing into her pussy, his balls slapped against her ass as she was bent on cumming hard. "Fuck, you're mine," he said, "I'm going to make my cock cum so hard!"</p> <p>"Oh, God!" she gasped, "I'm going to cum!"</p> <p>He increased his thrusting and pounded into her, his fingers digging into her hips as his thumb grazed her clit, his other hand gripping the headboard for support.</p> <p>The sensation was so intense, it was a blur; all the sensations that had been in her head before were now the last.</p> <p>She was shaking and twitching and moaning softly as the orgasm continued, "You're mine, my pussy belongs to you!"</p> <p>Kieran thrust into her, "But its the way I feel about you! You're my pussy! I can't live without it! I can't imagine life without you, but you'll never leave me!"</p> <p>"That's why I love you?" she said, "I'll never be able to make you forget me!"</p> <p>"I don't believe that!" he shouted, "I've never loved someone in my life! I think you're a complete idiot for giving up! It can't happen!"</p> <p>Kieran threw a leg over her body, taking his cock in her face.</p> <p>"I love you, I love you, I love you! Take me; make me your little cunt!"</p> <p>"All right! All right, alright! Take me!"</p> <p>As her hand touched his chest; he leaned against her; he thrust even more forcefully into her. A rivulet of liquid leaked from her lips onto her chin as another burst of pleasure shot through her; her body tensed and she felt herself go weak from the intense pleasure; then a deep sigh of bliss overtook them, then he collapsed across her body and fell still.</p> <p>He moved to the side of the bed.</p> <p>"You're mine," she said. "I love you!"</p> <p>"I love you to," he replied, "I love you!"</p> <p>They cuddled and fell asleep.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>"I do," Kieran said. "That was incredible."</p> <p>"I enjoyed that immensely," she replied. "What's the most you've been doing?"</p> <p>"You, my dear," he replied. "No, I haven't been working. But I have been working a little."</p> <p>"I can't believe what I just told you...what I just told you, baby," she replied. "I didn't just tell you that. It's true."</p> <p>"I know," he said.</p> <p>He felt more awake than he had when he was watching them from the doorway; he was a teenager, and his dick was a raging teenager.</p> <p>Kieran had been the one who wanted to see them in the car during a drive. He had planned it, and when they arrived home, her hand had found it's way to his crotch.</p> <p>He had sat there while his mouth and hands were worked, his fingers, palm and thumb wrapped around her erect clit; he couldn't believe she wasn't just saying goodbye to him when she had first told him that she was going to be going on a cruise with him.</p> <p>"I want this," she said. "I am so, so very, very, horny...I want you right now...so bad...and so much more, as soon as you get here..."</p> <p>He had rolled down the bed and pulled her legs apart; he wanted nothing more then to have her wrapped around him as they made love, and have her begging him for release, both of their bodies demanding their release.</p> <p>She had looked and smiled at him the whole time they had been driving. They had been silent, her expression was almost loving, almost knowing. She wanted nothing more than to be with him as long as he couldn't possibly take her home.</p> <p>As he had rolled off her, he saw that she was smiling at him. "Kieran," she said, "Kieran wait...please," he said.</p> <p>"Just hold on," she said. "Let's just have a little fun, and see what happens."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>He kissed her; it was their first kiss since the day they had seen each other last night.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>The followingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
