I think that she thought that her life had been ruined. "Mom died that day," she said in broken voice.</p> <p>I stood up and pulled her back down to me. I could feel her heart pounding as she wrapped her arms around me tightly. "I can't help what happened," I sobbed. "This isn't my fault. Just be safe mom," she whispered into my ear and kissed me quickly on the lips.</p> <p>I cried for about twenty minutes before I had to leave and I had to get back home. I had to go see Sharon. She had some things to do.</p> <p>I had a long drive home. My stomach was sour and I was sick again. I didn't even get to have sex with Sasha as I was so tired I didn't think I would be able to get it up again, when I got home. Sharon told me how scared she was of what had happened. "You need to tell me," she said. "It had a good impact on you."</p> <p>"I guess that's true. I can't remember all of it, but I sure remember being naked with her," I finally admitted. "What happened to you and Jason? Did she hurt you?"</p> <p>Sharon had calmed down enough to answer me. "Yes, I did. Jason's the only thing that beat her so badly that he's pretty much the only thing that beats me. I never want to be there again. It wasn't just about Jason, although I had to."</p> <p>In my mind, I could see that I had fucked it all up by telling Sharon this. Maybe Sharon had been so angry with me that she was in full control of me. I had always thought that the thought of that happening to her had made her very hot. I also thought that she might have done the same thing. I had no clue about how to deal with the situation here at home and we were married. I had never thought that Sharon could love me as much as I loved her. Then, there was how much I enjoyed the way Jason had dominated her.</p> <p>When I got to her house, I had to stop for a second before I could enter. I didn't want to go to Sharon. I didn't want to talk to her or watch her get what she wanted. I just had to talk to her. I knew that I didn't want to have to deal with the fact that I had raped Sharon. I was scared, but I knew that if I didn't talk to Sharon before, I was going to be even more scared.</p> <p>I waited to listen to the answer of the person I really felt that I could change. It was a woman. Actually, she was more a man that the woman I had just made love to, but I didn't know that I could change her. I knew that if I talked with Sharon that I would get to know her. I guess since I didn't fuck her back, I could just do that.</p> <p>When Sharon knocked on the door, I almost jumped when she came in. I had to force myself to smile. Now I really was in a state of euphoria that I would have been more prepared to give to another woman. I didn't know who I had fucked until this moment. If I had fucked her, I would have already gone after Sharon. Then, there was how big my dick was since I was so excited that I didn't think I had to go so far. I got even bigger as Sharon took my cock in her hand and stroked it. "I'm sorry," she said as she looked up at me. "I'm scared that maybe I will hate Jason, as much as I hate Jason. When will you be here?"</p> <p>I was surprised that Sharon was not scared. The thought of me fucking another woman was something that I had never considered. I could imagine her having a problem with other men and that was really a good combination to have, even if it killed her. I was really going to enjoy being with another woman.</p> <p>Once she got the hang of it, she looked around the living room. That room had a huge couch and couch that had had some damage during the divorce. I had already been sitting on the couch with my pants open.</p> <p>When she looked at me, she said, "I like the big couch."</p> <p>"I liked it too," I responded knowing that it still had some weight.</p> <p>The two of us moved to her bed quickly to have an hour of privacy. I laid down on the pillow that was under the back of the couch and sat. There was nothing but silence between us and it felt like every nerve in my body was firing off.</p> <p>Sharon sat up a little and looked around the room. In the midst of our activity, she had removed the rest of her clothes. She had removed her bra. Her hands wereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
