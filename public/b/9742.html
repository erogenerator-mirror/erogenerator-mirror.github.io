He could feel her thighs tighten on his hips and her body seemed to shake so much he could feel it on the bed below. He tried not to think about what she was feeling when he felt her body begin to shake and tremble. He felt her hips begin to tremble and quake. She was crying and he could see her breasts heaving.</p> <p>When she finally stopped the shaking stopped and he could breathe again. When he opened his eyes and saw that she was staring at him with love and adoration.</p> <p>At the same time he could feel his body react to her love. He closed his eyes and felt his cock respond to the vision of her love and adoration.</p> <p>Sarah finally let go of his cock and it slid slowly out of her. He could see his glistening cock coming out of her bush. He could feel the fluid dripping down his balls. She slowly rolled on to her back and he saw the glisten of her love juice on her pink lips. He leaned forward and ran his tongue across her lips and her clit. She moaned softly as he touched her with his tongue.</p> <p>He slipped from between her thighs and he watched as she lay there trembling. When she raised her head and looked at him he leaned forward and moved over her. He slid between her legs and ran his cock up and down the moist lips of her pussy. He rubbed the head along her pussy and when he came to rest at her hole she could feel it when he rubbed it up against her. She reached down and drew him against her hole, trying to get him in.</p> <p>"No," he whispered. "I don't want you to get pregnant." She shook her head. "Don't you ever ask me this."</p> <p>"I'll think about it," she answered and then pulled him inside her.</p> <p>He began to move inside her and in no time flat he was in her again. He had no regrets about what he had done. It was just easier.</p> <p>After what seemed like an eternity he was fully inside her. The only noise that sounded was Sarah's breathing, and he could hear the slick of her pussy as it slid up and down his cock. He could feel the tightness of her pussy around him. He held himself in her. He started stroking her and then he started moving in her. The pace quickened and soon he was pounding into her. He was pounding into her and she was responding to every motion. The bedsprings kept squeaking and the bedsprings squeaking as they rocked their bodies.</p> <p>Sarah started to moan and John knew that they had made love. He could feel her pussy as it slid up and down his cock. He couldn't believe how good it felt. He kept stroking her.</p> <p>"Oh, God," she cried.</p> <p>"I'm gonna make you cum!" he whispered hoarsely.</p> <p>Sarah looked up to see that he was smiling at her.</p> <p>"I can do that. God, John, I can do that," she hissed.</p> <p>"You are the best. Ohhh....mmmma."</p> <p>He pulled her closer to him and stroked her hair while they were making love. She started to tremble and shiver. He held her in his arms and stroked her back and she could feel his shaft moving in her. "Ohhh....yes, John. I can feel it. Oh God, yes, I can feel it. Oh, John, don't ever stop. I can't stop myself. I can't stop. Ohhh, fuck me, honey."</p> <p>They were both over the edge. John pulled out of her and Sarah was ready to cum. She wanted to cum with him. She wanted to cum in his arms. She wanted to cum on his cock. She wanted to cum with him in bed. She wanted to have his cock in her. She wanted to cum all over his cock. If he didn't cum between her legs she would have. She needed so badly to cum on his cock that she could do it right.</p> <p>"Oh, John." She was sobbing when again his cock entered her pussy.</p> <p>She tried to think the best she could but she couldn't think about anything except being close to him on the bed. She could feel her wetness surround him as he entered her. "Oh, god," she cried.</p> <p>John felt the pressure building and his cock began to swell even more. Sarah held him tight. She could feel her pussy lips wrap around him and the skin on his shaft slid as he thrust himself in and out of her. Her orgasm was building now. She heard herself crying quietly, feeling the pleasure of the orgasm so intense that she could practically see it. She was going to cum.
