So he decided to buy a room and the room would give everyone at the house a great view into the house, but also would take his money. On the night of the sale he wanted her to meet with a client in the bar and then come to the room with him that night, and that way he could get his money back from his credit card, so he had it paid in advance in a week, so that he could keep it in his account with her.</p> <p>So, he had the room ready for her to meet the client that Wednesday night.</p> <p>The appointment took place on Friday evening and there she had been waiting patiently for her husband to call. It was a lovely evening for all, as all of her friends were out celebrating their anniversary, so that it wasn't too much of a disappointment that he had missed a lot of the details of the day's events. He told her that he had booked a room out of town with a company of course and that she could have the room, but he thought he looked as if he was planning on doing her a favour in that state. "No problem."</p> <p>She had been looking forward to meeting this new man for ages. He wasn't only pretty, but he was intelligent too. "Would my lovely sweet bride go so well to the man of the house."</p> <p>"You really must let me have all the details."</p> <p>"No, please let me have this."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm glad to hear that."</p> <p>"You've done this before."</p> <p>"No, I don't think so. My sweet bride is just like me. She wants to spend her life with someone like you and we can't afford to have you."</p> <p>"Oh honey, you wouldn't want to lose your heart to someone like me."</p> <p>It was going to be a wonderful birthday gift for him. It was going to be a fabulous dinner with one of the most beautiful girls in the world. She had always been such a lucky girl when they had children. "That's it. He's a nice guy and a great friend. You'd do just about anything for him."</p> <p>"Of course I will do anything for him. Are you sure you want to do this?"</p> <p>"Of course I do. I wouldn't have it any other way."</p> <p>"Let's go up to the room and see if you still want to do this."</p> <p>He followed her up the steps into the room. It was a lovely set of rooms with a beautiful fireplace and a huge balcony which he took in turn to a nice little conservatory. He took in the room and walked around the room admiring all the beautiful places it had to offer a beautiful girl. "You certainly are beautiful. My sweet wife has such good taste in clothes. We should be buying you some of the things you can wear for the event."</p> <p>"I'd look fantastic in anything," she said simply and she started to open her blouse. He held out his hand for her to help lift it from her shoulders with a hand full of her lovely hair. She was wearing a black vest which looked sensational on her. With her lovely looking body, he could imagine taking it off to see what new delights to pick up. "I really must run and get a shower, it might get late."</p> <p>After she had dressed, he walked around looking at her a little more intimately. It was just as well all of this was done, because before he could sit down she had stripped off her vest and now she was just wearing her top which showed her large breasts in a lacy bra. In the light of the light coming through the window from the street lamps outside he could just make out just a hint of the shape of a nipple against the fabric of her top and even more as she started to put her bra on.</p> <p>He took her by the hand and led her up the settee to the large bed where he sat down as she got her bra off and sat down next to him. After taking off her vest and bra, she pulled a chair up the settee next to him and sat down to take his hand. She felt his strong hands on her back as they both sat down and she was soon feeling very warm and comfortable and she told him how good of a person he was to invite him to come upstairs with her at some point.</p> <p>He thought that he'd never come again though. She looked at him and had a really beautiful smile as he stood up suddenly and took his hand, leading her up to the balcony. She followed him up carefully and he took her back through the large doors. There must have been no one on the patio as the only movement around was the sliding doors of his room, so they couldn't be disturbed.
