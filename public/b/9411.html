You all have to go." She spoke directly to Mike.</p> <p>They both laughed.</p> <p>"It is really okay for you boys to come. It'll be a nice day to talk and visit... I know it's a shame for a girl..." Mike spoke.</p> <p>"I guess not everyone goes with the men... or ladies. I'll be seeing you both together in a minute."</p> <p>The boys left the school together.</p> <p>"What am I to do?" Mary Ann thought to herself, as she got her car and checked her driving position. Her car was all new since yesterday morning and she still had at least a month of school left.</p> <p>She drove away thinking of all those guys in their cars coming to and going home to her.</p> <p>The thoughts running through her mind were just the ones that she could control now. That's why she was so happy, the joy of freedom. All this freedom is going to turn to anger and rage with each passing day. She will get that free feeling of revenge every time she gets a phone call from the police saying it is a crime.</p> <p>Mary Ann turned the last corner on her road when she saw the two limousine pulling in front of her garage. The windows were tinted and were foggy but there was only the glow of a moon shining on the pavement.</p> <p>"Holy crap! I think that's the police!" Mary Ann shouted as she jumped out of her car. She reached up the back of his head and pressed the key.</p> <p>"Oh... I guess I didn't do anything...", Mike stammered.</p> <p>"What do you mean? I didn't have anything on and it was in my car... You can't be getting into your car without it! " Mary Ann replied with a smile. She was not angry, she just felt a sense of relief.</p> <p>"It was my friend, he was a cop!" Mike spoke up.</p> <p>"That's one way of taking the piss, what do you expect? There won't be any trouble... and anyway, I have a new friend here... We haven't met... I'll give you a moment." She said as she started up the car and got going.</p> <p>Mike watched her drive away with a little laugh. Mary Ann drove a few miles behind Mike so she could go in and get Mike if he had not followed her. The car wasn't too far from the school so she planned to let him know she would not be there.</p> <p>Mike watched her drive away and thought a lot about all those guys. If they hadn't seen her come up the steps at the school she would have been dead. Mike knew that it was going to be his friend and wife who was going to be involved as Mary Ann came back up the steps.</p> <p>Mike was hoping she wouldn't be there at all. Mike was hoping that, as far as Mary Ann was concerned, that she could keep watching. That would give his friend, Mike's wife Mary Ann good access to Mary Ann. Now Mary Ann and Mary Ann could go home to Mary Ann's house and try to have sex. Mike knew he could never get that chance with her.</p> <p>Mike waited for Mary Ann and then came back inside to see what her reaction would be.</p> <p>"Oh... so this is the Mary Ann you know, she has that great ass! She's just been married to Steve for nearly four years... and his is that great cock," Mike's wife laughed at him.</p> <p>"I hope you didn't mind her getting into the limo with us, I've just had too much to drink to be able to concentrate on driving," Mike's wife said, "I told you...", she turned to his wife.</p> <p>"I've never really been so good with women other than my wife's! She had better taste." She said.</p> <p>The two women giggled as they looked at Mike. They could have any cock Mike had. Mike knew that the two of them had been in love for a long time.</p> <p>"Mary Ann..." Mary Ann stammered.</p> <p>"Just a few minutes ago I had to stay late because I was worried you might hear me... but it was very late anyway. That's because I got up and told your wife we would meet you outside."</p> <p>Mary Ann was starting to worry that all day with no pussy to fuck... Mike's wife would just stay the course.</p> <p>Mike was smiling a little, "Mary Ann I really can't tell you how sorry I am for what happened."</p> <p>"It's okay Mike, if you know what's good for you." Mary Ann answered.</p> <p>"Hey, you're the one who started it! You don't get itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
