She had to have a ball. She felt the tension that formed between her fingers and began to work it out. This was all about her. She pulled her hands away from her face, and stared at the ground. Her hands had been moving in a way that she wanted to keep this going. She had to, she was in the wrong place, and she didn't want to. Her mind spun and shook, her body was in a state that her feet had gone to and she didn't even know it. Her hands continued to work their work.</p> <p>Her right ankle was becoming tired of its routine - this was her Achilles heel. The muscle in her knee had always been a weakness in her. It was why she wanted to be with him. It was why she had to have this to do. She wanted to be that man. She never wanted to be like this with anyone else. What she felt with her body tonight was her whole world and she felt so out of her comfort zone.</p> <p>Her stomach rolled from her words to the point where there was a light pinkness rising in her lips. This was a lot to take in. Katherine had been watching her with amusement and admiration for some time now, but she had never expected to like the look of a man with his penis in her mouth. "Katherine? Is that... is that what you've been waiting for?," she said to a stunned woman, who was still working on one knee.</p> <p>"Yes," the woman spoke up.</p> <p>"It's not that I've been waiting for it," Katherine said while looking at the woman, who was trying to smile with amusement that was the same smile that Katherine was starting to get.</p> <p>"You know what?," Katherine said, looking at the woman, who continued working on another knee. "This isn't your time, is it K? Is there something I should know?," Katherine said while looking at the woman who looked at Katherine's hands and her face with an expression of uncertainty and disbelief.</p> <p>There was a silence before the woman spoke up, "I know my body was never meant to have this kind of sex, but I want to do this - I want to do this," she said as once again her lips formed an expression of lust.</p> <p>Katherine felt a tingle of excitement shoot through her spine, the tingle of anticipation, the tingle of fear and the tingle of desire. The woman, the woman who was giving Katherine all of these years was suddenly, but by whom, doing what she wanted to do just wasn't right. She wanted to have a man as a woman, not another woman. That same feeling ran through her mind of hunger and a longing.</p> <p>Katherine looked around at the women. She realized she had been staring at the woman for most of the time in disbelief of this moment and now was taking in the entire situation. She felt as though her mind had been made for some different sexual medium. The fact that she was doing this to a man, to another man, to another girl. It was just this whole thing that had begun before in the beginning, and had built to a point that it had never stopped it. All of that was still in the current situation.</p> <p>Katherine's mind was now made for the moment of truth for her. She could only look around at the women. All of the girls were looking at the man she was about to do this more than a few seconds ago, and all of them were looking at him for some sign that this might really happen. She had to go on with it - she just had to go on with it, but just go with it, had to go on with it and have this man do this to her as the woman had done with all of these other girls a couple of days ago.</p> <p>She was beginning to worry - what if she was about to be unfaithful to her Master? She had to be strong, was that right? She could not just let herself go and let it happen. He was right in front of her. She had to go on with this. She had to let this happen. This is what she wanted.</p> <p>Katherine looked over at the woman, as she started to look up at a man who was about to enter her room.</p> <p>"Katherine, please," she began to say.</p> <p>"What?," the woman replied, looking back at Katherine.</p> <p>"What?" asked Katherine.</p> <p>"Katherine, you have to do this," said the woman, "You just have to, you just have to go on with this."</p> <p>"We can't," Katherine protested. "You said so many of your secrets already."</p> <p>Katherine was about to argue again, but she quickly saw the look of desperation in the womanâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
