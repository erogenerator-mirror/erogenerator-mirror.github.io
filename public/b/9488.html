I'll always remember that."</p> <p>She was grinning and blushing as she pulled me closer to her. "You should call me that. You must know what I'm doing right now."</p> <p>I grabbed the waistband of her panties and slid her panties down over her hips and off of her ankles. They followed the path of her feet to the floor. She was wearing a pair of high-cut blue jockey shorts, but now I quickly realized that the shorts were a pair of tiny, black lace panties. "That's ok, I'll keep the panties on," I whispered quietly. With that I grabbed the panties and began sliding them down her legs.</p> <p>She stepped carefully out of them and onto her back on the futon. She spread a cushion behind me to make an even more awkward situation. A second later she stood up on her hands and knees, with her ass hovering just above my head. I reached up and caressed those cheeks again, which prompted another moan of delight.</p> <p>"You are so nice to me," she sighed.</p> <p>"You are so nice yourself."</p> <p>"You need any encouragement, lover?"</p> <p>I was stunned. I had never dreamed that I might want to make love to another man, let alone for that matter in any fashion. Now here I was getting off the futon and taking her from behind in nothing but my underwear, while two girls were doing in my den. I felt embarrassed and out of control.</p> <p>But I kept on going. "Why don't you help yourself. I'm sure you don't think I know you want me to do that." She quickly got down on her knees and buried her face up against my briefs as she moved into me, rubbing her nose up along the length of my cock. Her hands were busy working between my legs, and soon I could feel that she was starting to breathe through my underwear.</p> <p>She moaned softly into my shorts when she moved her tongue up to me again, and then continued her journey up to kiss the top of my cock. "Mmm, yessss," she sighed. "That's so nice." She started to kiss the top of my cock again.</p> <p>I put my hands on her cheeks and urged her back down onto her back. I had never gone down on a girl before, and this was even more exciting than I expected. It was actually kind of fun, because I was the most nervous of all. This was new experience for me, and it seemed to be the best way to take a penis.</p> <p>I moved my mouth toward her lips a second time, hoping to kiss her and taste her mouth. The result was like nothing I had encountered before. She kissed me, pushing her tongue into my mouth, and started sucking on my tongue, moving her lips around my mouth as I sucked on hers. It felt really good. She pressed her hips against mine, and I grabbed her breasts and began massaging them, making her groan when I moved my hands down into the front of her panties. This time I found my fingers quickly reaching under them and pushing deep into her hot pussy. I pressed one finger into her, trying to find her G-spot. It didn't really work, but it was pretty hard to pull this girl on top of me in a position where I could feel her moving around as I held her down. With a groan I knew I had found it.</p> <p>I took my free hand and reached down between us, feeling her clit for the first time. It was pretty obvious she was starting to get very excited with what she was feeling. As I started to move my fingertip around a bit she pushed my hand away, breaking our kiss.</p> <p>"That was...that was amazing," she said. That came out so quietly it was almost drowned out by her gasps and occasional moans.</p> <p>"Well, it was pretty intense too," I confessed. "Now I'm going to have to find a way to do better than this."</p> <p>We fell back on our backs, and I quickly pulled off my shirt. My own breasts were heaving as my heart pounded and my pussy was burning with anticipation. Finally, she pushed me back up onto my feet, and climbed up between my legs. She knelt up a moment to give it a little spin, and then straddled me. We were both moaning with excitement, both trying to find the other's opening, and trying to find the perfect spot for the penetration of our genitals. We were practically humping each other. It went on for only moments, but we seemed to have a much greater connection than ever before. I could feel her pussy clenching down on me, and she was grinding herself into me.</p> <p>She started to move faster again, almost immediately reaching the point of no return when she stopped completely. We were both gasping for airâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
