She felt how wonderful it was to have him so completely inside, their bodies meeting with little squeals and whimpering sounds. She felt him begin to move more quickly, his pelvis slapping her ass with each push and Samantha groaned with the sudden sensation. He began to thrust harder into her, his arms tightening around her as he did so, bringing both their own moans and grunts into an ever increasing chorus that rang in and out of the small room. Sam's head was back arched, her long blond hair cascading around her face in a mess. Samantha's face was flushed and she was breathing heavily. She was flushed from her body's reactions, from the sweat dripping off of her, and from the pleasure that she was feeling, from finally being able to do something that she had wanted to for so long and for so long...</p> <p>Samantha had never thought of herself as beautiful. In fact, she was still a little bit of a nerd, and even then she knew how amazing her looks were, but most of her classes were never anything special. She never cared who she chose to be with, she just wanted to be loved. It was her own world, but then it was also hers and she would not have been able to do without it for long. She was the type of girl who loved school, had her girlfriends and she had a good time. She didn't think she would have done so even if she had needed an extra pair of hands on her body to keep her happy. And yet here she was, her best friend in a room full of other women and she was having sex right next to them, her body, her face, her breasts, her cunt, right next to her and she loved it. She loved it more than anything in her entire life.</p> <p>Sam looked up briefly to see him still behind her. She heard his words as she felt him moving inside her with more force, her body moving in response, as he fucked her with his hips, his eyes looking over her breasts, the sight almost driving her over the edge. She felt the pressure building, but could not speak. She was too caught up in the moment of ecstasy that now enveloped her as her body let go of all control and started to let itself go. Her moans echoed with every thrust, and she felt him thrusting in deeper, harder now, her body reacting as he drove deeper into her. She felt him beginning to sweat again, beads of sweat dripping between her breasts.</p> <p>"God...ohhh Goddd....ohhh God." Samantha thought in unison with his moans, "Oh god. Oh god. Oh god." Over and over his name and hers were coming from her and they could feel it running down her breasts and the warm slickness of his fluids that was still pouring from her and filling their bodies. All three of them were now lost in the moment of ecstasy, the pleasure of their union reaching deeper and deeper to the very soul of those around them.</p> <p>He felt her shudder and she felt his own orgasm burst and his own body shake as he pumped more of his cum deep into her. A second or so later they both felt the cum inside her squirting and spraying against the walls of the small room. It felt as if every ounce of his mind was being turned on. It was as if he was being connected to her in the deepest space of his mind, the very air of her universe, the very universe. He looked down at her with wild eyes and Samantha smiled dreamily at him. They were floating in bliss right there, completely at peace with themselves and other, mores of reality that he wasn't.</p> <p>"Oh fuck, Sam. That was the best orgasm I have ever had." He whispered it in her ear as they were floating in bliss around the others in the room. Samantha gave a weak smile of agreement after hearing herself admit the words and felt a little dizzy at what had just occurred. "Oh yes. It's been incredible."</p> <p>Samantha was speechless for a few moments until she was back on her own in bed. She was completely satisfied, yet there were a number of things she did not know about these men. They had done this to her, they had made her do this, and they had all made her feel special, but each of them were making her feel so good just that it was amazing.</p> <p>"So, is that a deal then or not?" she queried with a smile. Their words came out in a whisper, and Sam looked at her in the dim light of the room. She saw him look back at her, as if to say, "So this is how life works out?" Samantha smiled shyly as she reached to her hand to feel his chest. It felt soft and warm underneath her hand and to her pleasure she began to rub it.</p> <p>"It's going to be theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
