It was just sex. It was more of a sexual experience than anything that was done by any of the men they had been with. They made love. It was as special as it was passionate. It was as real as when they used to share themselves with each other. Now it was an act of love. With them being open to each other and having a wonderful time. With them having no expectations of their partner to be with them and to give each other the sexual release they sought.</p> <p>After about five minutes they both got up and got dressed. They both put on their robes and went out the door. As they stepped out into the hallway that had nothing more than a pool of light from the street they both became aware of someone looking at them. Just being caught at the wrong time made them both start to get aroused. The man started to say something and as he did he was walking towards them smiling and holding out his hand.</p> <p>"I am David."</p> <p>The man held out his hand and shook Chris's as he introduced himself.</p> <p>"Chris," said David as he shook them both at the same time.</p> <p>"I don't know what you're doing here, but thanks for stopping."</p> <p>"My name's David by the way. This is my wife, Samantha. Samantha this is Chris."</p> <p>"Oh, good to meet you Chris," David extended his hand and Chris extended his. Their hands touched.</p> <p>"My name's Chris," Chris said and David held his hand.</p> <p>"David, nice to meet you. You're looking well," David told Chris.</p> <p>"Well thank you David," Chris smiled. They stepped up to the pool. This was a private hot bath. It was located by the pool side as some privacy. There was enough room to sit. David took Chris inside and they sat down. They talked for about ten minutes and Chris was in complete control of his arousal.</p> <p>David turned to Chris, "Chris, please take off your robe."</p> <p>"Yes, of course."</p> <p>Chris reached behind his back and loosened the tie behind his neck. He slowly let the robe slide off. David then reached down and pulled it back.</p> <p>"I want you to lie back on the bath."</p> <p>Chris did as he was told and David moved into the tub. He reached up and pulled him down facing him while David reached out and grabbed Chris's crotch. David began squeezing and squeezing around Chris's crotch and up to his face. They both heard Chris moan. He raised up.</p> <p>"I have never done anything like this before," Chris said while David's fingers were still pinching him.</p> <p>"That is very interesting. I like it," I did it too so that you can see what you are giving up," David chuckled.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," Chris whispered.</p> <p>David reached up and put Chris's nipple in his mouth. He sucked hard on it, then kissed it. He sucked on it harder then David's could move. It was not enough to get Chris off. David had an inspiration when he looked up seeing the pleasure on Chris's face. David moved to Chris's lips. Chris opened for him. David stuck his tongue in Chris's mouth. He could taste the saltiness of Chris's sweat. When David moved away from Chris' mouth, he asked, "So do you still want to give me a blow job?"</p> <p>"Yes," Chris spoke excitedly.</p> <p>"Then I guess I will. Here I will take off my robe." With that David slid Chris's robe off.</p> <p>They both sank into the tub and began rubbing their bodies with the soft warm material of the bath. This made them even more aroused and excited. They spent long minutes touching and caressing each other. They were moaning. They were in total ecstasy when they both heard the other one.</p> <p>"Do you like to do that to me?" David asked.</p> <p>"Oh, yes, I do. It feels nice. I always love being made love to."</p> <p>"Can we try to make love together? " David asked.</p> <p>"Yes, of course," Chris agreed.</p> <p>David got up from the tub and sat next to Chris. He grabbed Chris by the hands and guided him over to the wall of the water. Then he guided Chris down towards him.</p> <p>"That is better."</p> <p>David leaned down and kissed Chris on the forehead as he took the nipple in his mouth. The tip of Chris's mouth was very erotic. But the feel of David's face against him made him want to kiss him. He leaned down. He kissed the tip of Chris's tongue. Then Chris opened his mouth. David's tongue slowly parted the lips of Chris's.</p> <p>David was licking the lips of Chris's mouth when Chris spoke. "You taste so good. I'm glad you're notâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
