I was just wearing a light tank and a pair of sunglasses, when I felt a presence at the side of the pool. To our mutual surprise, I had just finished applying sunscreen to my skin, and saw her out there topless on the diving board. She didn't seem to notice that I was there or that I knew what she did, at least with her bikini.</p> <p>My mind reeled! A beautiful, young woman, nude swimming nude, her ass covered by a bright yellow string bikini bottom, her pussy bare and swollen, her arms, legs and feet completely exposed. It was clear she wanted me to see. And, yes, I wanted to see!</p> <p>"How long is this going to take us?" I asked myself. "You know this is my vacation." I decided not to ask her, in fact I might have to ask her on this beach.</p> <p>"We're going to the mountains. I'm going to a resort with a client. He's married, and I guess he's here for a vacation. He's staying in our rooms for a month or so." A thought crossed my mind, but I just wanted to see if she would say yes. "It's all for the pleasure, that's all."</p> <p>My brain was whirling! She was totally naked, or did she just plan it beforehand? The thought left me with a throbbing in my pants, but I thought better of it, and went back out to my towel. To my surprise as I lay there on the cushion I saw that she had taken her shades off, and was peeking over the edge of the pool. Now she was fully covered. She was smiling again, and waving at me with her finger. It was as if this was not a small joke. Her hand went back to the bottom of the pool, spreading her legs. "Does it still work? I hope it does, you must be in for a surprise." She seemed genuinely interested in something like this, even though she was nude.</p> <p>My cock was straining hard against the fabric of my swimsuit; if she could see my erection, then she would know. I watched her. I was sure she could see, maybe the way my cock pushed up my swimsuit as it pushed up my chest, or how it stretched up between my legs and against my inner thigh. I'm not sure whether it would have stopped the erection, but with that brief flash, her eyes seemed to linger. Her tits were standing straight out, her nipples hard and straining against where their covering made their way into her tanned flesh. This was exciting.</p> <p>"It's working," I muttered to myself. "I'm about to take my bathing suit off."</p> <p>"Yes, it's working," she said to herself again. "You may as well get comfortable, I have plans." Then she climbed out into the sun and turned to head back toward her room.</p> <p>I was confused. I'm guessing she's trying to seduce me, how does she take the whole thing, is she taking it as a joke, maybe to gain excitement, maybe to let me know her intentions. I guess she would, because she was naked now. I'm not sure how far she would let it go, but I was curious.</p> <p>She was a pretty sight. She had a body like a well sculpted woman, her skin just white against the dark tan of her chest, and the dark hair of the forest around it. She was thin, not so thin that her breasts could hide her nipples from view, but she had them, just barely, covered, which was a little unnerving, even to me. That's what my mind was saying now as I gazed at her body. Those lovely, dark aureoles and nipples were pushing against the sheer fabric on each side of her body. She had a nice shape, her hips and buttocks narrow and her legs nicely rounded.</p> <p>It's not like I expected her to do that, no I didn't expect it. But that still seemed wrong, but for some reason I took it as my chance to get off the diving board. I climbed the ladder, which only took my shorts and T-shirt to my ankles, got a couple minutes of sun to dry off my hair, and went back out on the diving board. With my swim suit pulled up against my cock, I walked toward her, not sure exactly what she wanted.</p> <p>"I'll put the top back on, it's not necessary," she said. She pulled a sheet over her upper body, her shoulders, breasts, her stomach. "Now sit on the diving board," she said. And I sat down.</p> <p>She turned on the water and got out of the pool. Standing next to me, she put her armsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
