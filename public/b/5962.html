She stopped. Then she said nothing.</p> <p>"Don't be afraid. You're too young."</p> <p>I was a little shaken. I asked.</p> <p>"Do you want to fuck me?"</p> <p>"Not right now. Your first time with us. Just talk to me."</p> <p>"Just talk."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>She pulled herself out of the tub and stood by the bed. She started undressing.</p> <p>"Come sit by me."</p> <p>With a bit of hesitation, I sat. She sat beside me.</p> <p>"Come with me into the bedroom."</p> <p>I was a little taken aback but excited too. I nodded and followed her into the bedroom.</p> <p>She began kissing me again. My cock began growing in her hand. "You're so gorgeous," she whispered.</p> <p>I responded by pushing my hips to get her hand between my legs. She reached through my legs, found my hardness, and grasped my erection, then stroked it. She rubbed me a bit, feeling its pulsations. She moved up to the tip, then slowly lowered herself. More than half the crown was in when she stopped.</p> <p>"I'm sorry. I didn't plan this."</p> <p>She smiled at me. "I plan to fuck you, but not like this."</p> <p>"I know. I'm just surprised we won't die right away."</p> <p>She slid him into her again. It wasn't as tight as I imagined. But I found pleasure in the feel of her. I had always believed that it took more than a man.</p> <p>She began to fuck me again, slowly. Slow. Longer. This was no sex thing. This was an effortless fucking that had to be made up of the best of both it and the many orgasms it had to offer. But it sure felt good.</p> <p>Our bodies touched each other. The feeling of being a naked woman was intense. I knew where it went from there.</p> <p>"I want you to come," she said in my ear. "I've never come in the way I'd like me to on your first time. I want to feel your cock in me and in my mouth."</p> <p>"I've never had a woman suck me before," I said. "I've only had a woman come in the water."</p> <p>"I know. But it's a first for me too."</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"I'm sure."</p> <p>"I want you to fuck me again and again."</p> <p>"Yes, and I want to make love to you."</p> <p>"And you can fuck me at anytime you like."</p> <p>"I am your friend."</p> <p>"I want to be your friend," she asked. I couldn't resist another thought. "Do you think I should be your friend?" I could hear the hope in her voice.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want to fuck?"</p> <p>"I'm sure," she said. She lay on her back, legs spread wide and I knelt between her legs. She raised them to meet my cock. "Put it in me."</p> <p>"Where?"</p> <p>But I was going to put it where ever it would fit and when I did, she was all I could do to get in position. I slowly got in position between her knees and began pounding her. I had never felt such excitement as we were doing now. And she could feel it.</p> <p>"Oh my God!" she cried. "Fuck me!"</p> <p>It only served to make me get in more and more of the same thing I was feeling. It wasn't even about me, but she was getting me into every cell of her body.</p> <p>With each thrust I felt as if I was trying to come. And every time I tried to pull out, my cock would plunge back into her a little ways.</p> <p>"Fuck me!" she cried again. And this time she was yelling. "Just fuck me hard! I want to feel my own dick inside of me."</p> <p>That was the last thought I had before that I came. I felt it, almost every pulse, and she felt it, but she continued to feel it herself.</p> <p>She pulled me down to her kissing me. "My turn," she said. "I want to feel you come again tonight."</p> <p>"You're not allowed to stop until you're ready to do it again."</p> <p>She smiled. "Come on! Fuck me, now! I want to be your lover."</p> <p>I rolled onto her, pulled out of her, and moved her on her back. I started again before she could even respond to my move. I was not sure she would go along. "Fuck me!" I yelled. "I want to feel you in me! Do it." I put her legs inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
