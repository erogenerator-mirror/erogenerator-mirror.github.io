His face was intense. He knew I was a virgin. It was the most vulnerable of all emotions. All he wanted to do now was use that body. I leaned back, letting him feel my breasts, as his hands continued their journey down past my waist and onto the insides of my thighs. My pussy was still soaking wet, the coolness of the room only intensifying the need in my hands to be on him. The desire was overwhelming.</p> <p>He slowly brought his hands back up the side of my back, finally arriving at my breasts. As he was sucking my nipples into his mouth, his hands were all over me. I wanted him so bad that the pleasure had my orgasm coming, right then and there. I wrapped my arms around to him and we were kissing again, when suddenly his penis was inside. It was as big as the one that had started it's journey. He was already as hard as I was, and he made me gasp out loud as his penis buried itself into my vagina.</p> <p>My eyes opened, and it was just as a relief to see his smile as I felt his hands move me around. His fingers were now inside me instead, sliding in and out a few times with slow, deep strokes. I gasped as I felt the warm feeling of his wetness inside my body, his fingers probing my sex, his thumb working on my clit. I was now so hot and full, wanting more. I turned my head to one side, looking at him for more of the same.</p> <p>"I love you," he whispered, his eyes darkening as he gazed at me. "Your beauty made me do this."</p> <p>All I could do was smile, as I looked him in the eye again. I wanted him inside me again. I wanted nothing more than his cock inside me.</p> <p>"I want you," I whispered into his ear, almost as if I were speaking with his dick. "I want the same thing from you."</p> <p>This last plea only made him smile. He was already so hard as we fucked, and as he reached around to spread my bottom, I could feel the tip of his dick pressing against the opening to my body. As he pressed inside me, I wrapped my legs around him, and then began to rub my body up and down his.</p> <p>He put both his arms around me, and started to slide his body up and down the full length of mine as he fucked me again and again. With the added feeling of his hands at my breasts, I knew he probably wouldn't be able to last very long. And although it felt amazing, his pace was only beginning.</p> <p>"You are so tight," he moaned as he lifted his head up. "God you feel so good, baby."</p> <p>I closed my eyes and let the pleasure wash over me, allowing a light, soft moan to pass through me on each of his shallow thrusts. My arms tightened around him, and as his penis continued to be stroked, I closed my eyes and leaned my head back, allowing another orgasm to overtake me.</p> <p>Then I noticed him move himself up to sit on his stool. He bent over a little to give me a quick kiss, and then turned off the bathroom light. "Let's move this party to our bedroom now," he said, gesturing me to follow him. "Carry the tray over here," he said as he motioned to the bedroom on the other side of the room.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" I demanded, looking over the nakedness and wetness of him, feeling his hand still inside my vagina. "You have to wait until I get back."</p> <p>I moved out of the way as he moved onto his hands and knees behind me and began to rub his entire body against mine, the same way I fingered myself. We were both too far gone to get enough pleasure.</p> <p>He moved away again, and then stood up from the floor and began to enter me again. I moved closer to the edge of the bed as I felt him inside me, still holding myself to him. He leaned over, his mouth to my ear, still stroking himself into my body.</p> <p>I thought I heard him ask something but couldn't tell if he was speaking with his mouth to my ear or his own. I didn't care, because I felt so wanted by him. He whispered, "Cum for me, baby. Cum with me."</p> <p>His voice was sexy as he whispered, "Don't wait."</p> <p>When he had released himself, he was sitting there with a smile on his face, which was one of the things that made him so beautiful. Suddenly he reached out to take my hand and led me to the bed. Once I was sitting on the edge, he pushed me backwards and pulled me into his embrace. Our mouths were pressed together, as we kissed tenderly.
