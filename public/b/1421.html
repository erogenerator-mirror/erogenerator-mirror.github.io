She said, nodding.</p> <p>He pulled her onto his lap. Their mouths locked, their tongues danced together, and she felt so powerful. After a moment, he stood and followed her out of the bathroom, her small hand held his cock. He helped her out of her jacket, and she turned to lean against the wall, her breasts pushing slightly against his chest, her legs straddling his waist. She leaned back against the cool tile and he slipped one hand between them. She gasped as she felt the weight of his cock and ran her hand up and down, pressing against it, and feeling it twitch and grow harder until it was at full mast.</p> <p>"Now for you, my sweet. Sit down on the bench, and I will be behind you, just for a second, no hunching," he purred. She obeyed, feeling him slide between her legs, pushing his cock inside her in one smooth motion.</p> <p>She was already wet, her own juices running down his balls and along his shaft as he penetrated her. He took his cock out of her and she felt him replace it with her ass, his hands reaching out for her breasts roughly. She moaned in frustration. "You will wait for me in my office, will you?" He nodded. "Then you will learn to be obedient. You will obey as I am."</p> <p>She moaned and turned, leaning against him, her hands still cupping his cock. He pushed her onto her back, leaning forward, kissing her deeply, and she felt his hands on her breasts. She arched her back, trying to meet his mouth, and with his cock still inside of her he began to move rhythmically. His hands kept stroking her face, caressing hers, kneading them as he took her breasts in his hands. He lowered his head to her neck, nuzzling it there, leaving his cock still inside just a little ways. But even his hands were still on her breasts, her nipples hardening and becoming erect from his caress. She felt him thrust harder into her, his balls slapping against her. She could hear the wet sounds of his hand coming up to her face, and then, to her, a hand that felt him inside her and her ass, and finally came to rest against her pussy, as he came with the same force.</p> <p>They lay there, holding each other, kissing and moving their bodies on the tile, his cock still buried inside of her. For a long time neither spoke. He took her by her hand and brought her in slowly to his bed, his cock never leaving her pussyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
