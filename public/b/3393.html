"Please, please," he continued.</p> <p>"I don't know if I could handle it," she said with a touch of sad disappointment. Then looking over at her friend, "He's mine now, and you will take his place."</p> <p>Bridget took a deep breath. "You don't understand. I love him, but...I love you anyway. We have this kind of relationship to uphold." Bridget's fingers pressed against the side of his face, "You, my dear young man, belong to me, and not to anyone else. Your father and I both own you," her fingertips touched his lips, "and you can't say he isn't yours if you only ask him."</p> <p>His face twisted in pain. He knew she hadn't really said it, but he was confused by why at all. Even though she was right, he couldn't believe she had actually felt the same way as he had.</p> <p>He stared up at her coldly. "Will I feel...whole for...if you still love me?"</p> <p>She shook her head and pulled the straps from her dress. "My dear young man, I've been asking you to...be my wife again."</p> <p>As if in a daze, she pulled out the small box. There, hidden within the pink wrapping was a beautiful jeweled bracelet.</p> <p>"W...who...what..." he stammered, unsure. She smiled, "Please. I'll be your wife, my new husband. I'll have the wedding dress, and he'll pay you to have it. Please. I'll...be his wife forever."</p> <p>She looked back at him, "Now, what did you say to that?"</p> <p>Shaking his head so many times, he was sure he couldn't form his mind, he'd just had a hard morning.</p> <p>As if knowing what he'd just said, she stepped away, and walked toward him. "I'm not going to tell you. It's perfectly natural. There's nothing you can or won't do that's wrong. You'd have to love him before you give him a choice. It's perfectly natural." Bridget's voice was soothing. "It's okay to love him for me," she said as she reached out to kiss him passionately on the lips.</p> <p>Her lips pulled back, "Be sure to kiss him, sweetheart. I'll be watching you. You'll love him the very same way." Her eyes twinkled, and her smile made her face glow. "I've been wanting to see him for some time and I knew you would."</p> <p>He watched as she began to shed her dress, and then his eyes drifted to her breasts, clad in a tiny white bra, and then back to her face and hands.</p> <p>"Beautiful," he said, looking down to stare at her beautiful breasts. "Thank you." She grinned at him, and reached out and touched his chest. "And yours?" she asked.</p> <p>He stared back at her, holding his breath. "That's wonderful."</p> <p>"Then put that on," Bridget said.</p> <p>They walked down the hall to the bedroom, kissing each other's cheeks tenderly. After their kissing session, Bridget sat beside him and guided him onto his back, and then knelt beside him, leaning back. As her hand slid around him, she gave him a passionate smile, "I have waited, and I hope I can love you as long as you've waited for me."</p> <p>He looked into her eyes, "You know I'm married to a gorgeous woman named...Debra," he smiled at her.</p> <p>"I know," she cooed. Then reaching to feel his penis through his pants, "It is a rare combination," she said. "My husband will be married to some of the most gorgeous women in the world."</p> <p>Her fingers curled around his shaft and gently stroked him, "He loves you," she whispered.</p> <p>"Thank you, Lola?" he whispered.</p> <p>She nodded, and he looked around the room, "Here, in your bedroom." As they walked past a closet, she opened the door and pulled out a long gown. He smiled, the color of lavender flowing softly about her body.</p> <p>"We can do this my way," she stated as they walked back to the bedroom, "and I promise you'll love it."</p> <p>"It's so beautiful," he said, holding up the bodice of her dress, "It's a perfect combination."</p> <p>Pulling it up and over her arms, they both laughed. As he stood, he bent over at the waist, and she pulled it down. As it slipped over her bottom, she slipped off the dress.
