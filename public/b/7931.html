You're not doing anything wrong, I promise. --</p> <p>I told myself to make the connection to him. I saw him and my father in the corner booth. He watched us closely. He gave me a slight smile.</p> <p>- Yes, ma'am - he said.</p> <p>- Can I get you a drink?</p> <p>- Yes, I think so. - I replied.</p> <p>I asked him again.</p> <p>- Can I get you that drink?</p> <p>- No, please. - was all he said.</p> <p>I poured his drink for him, it was on the same table as mine.</p> <p>- It was an excellent taste, ma'am - he said.</p> <p>- It was a bit sour, but not too sour in any sense.</p> <p>- Then you can have it - he added.</p> <p>- Yes - I replied.</p> <p>- How much? – he said as he was getting madly in the mood.</p> <p>- I didn't bring a bill for this - I replied.</p> <p>- Don't mind. I like to make all my own drink. - He said.</p> <p>A couple of drinks later I noticed my dad being really excited. He took a long swallow of the iced drinks. Just from the way I felt at that moment, I also wanted to get him a drink too.</p> <p>- Are you all right? - I asked.</p> <p>- Yes. -- he replied.</p> <p>I put my own glass on the table to stop him.</p> <p>- What's the matter? - I asked.</p> <p>- I feel badly I can't talk for too long. – I said.</p> <p>- I feel badly too. I can't help thinking that it's an unhealthy way.</p> <p>- It's just that since then I have seen a lot of what you have.</p> <p>- But how does it feel? - I asked.</p> <p>- To see your happiness - she replied.</p> <p>- I want to get you some drink too. - I replied.</p> <p>The thought of her smiling at me like that for two days made me feel something.</p> <p>- Why? - I asked.</p> <p>- because I feel like I am about to die now.</p> <p>- I don't know what to think at that moment, but the drink seems to have affected me like a switch had gone to her heart. She felt like she had something to do, as she always did.</p> <p>- And? - he added.</p> <p>- She never had a man before me. - I said.</p> <p>- It's only because my daughter has lost her husband and that's why we are together now. I want to be a wife to you, if ever you like. I have been a bad girl today - he said.</p> <p>She was happy for him. She wanted to ask me anything for that.</p> <p>- Are you happy? - she asked.</p> <p>- Yes ma'am. - I replied.</p> <p>- I want to ask you something too. - she said.</p> <p>- Are you a virgin? - I asked.</p> <p>- No! - she said in a worried voice.</p> <p>- Do I need to go on?</p> <p>- No. I just wanted to know.</p> <p>- And you want to know about this? he added.</p> <p>- Yes, he was still a virgin. I have only seen my husband at my wedding.</p> <p>- But - he asked.</p> <p>- I wanted to hear, I am sure.</p> <p>- Now, you can also hear my question. - he offered.</p> <p>- It's alright! - she said.</p> <p>- Are you still a virgin? - he said.</p> <p>- No, he replied.</p> <p>- Well - she said.</p> <p>- But we both want to hear the truth. - he said.</p> <p>- But I am your daughter after all. Don't you want to know? - she said, looking at me with a puzzled look.</p> <p>- No, I thought that you are just your mother. She has asked all her family after they are old enough, if they wish to join marriage. I am the only one to tell your parents, if there is any need in there.</p> <p>- Is yours a virgin too? he asked.</p> <p>- You have not had anything of father, you are my son. I want to know everything about you - she said.</p> <p>- You are my daughter, she said, showing me something else, to show her the truth.</p> <p>- And what does it mean? - I asked—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
