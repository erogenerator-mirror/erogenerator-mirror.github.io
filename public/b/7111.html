I could hear his breathing getting faster and faster.</p> <p>"So, uh, can I start with an answer?" he asked, a little shyly.</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>"How long?"</p> <p>"Until I'm sure. What about you?"</p> <p>"A couple of months, maybe a couple more. My family is in a slump, especially in our area."</p> <p>"That's cool. Just the same as what she said. This would be good practice."</p> <p>"It's not that."</p> <p>"It's just, really what you were about to ask?</p> <p>"You mean how much is there?"</p> <p>"Don't kid me!" he said with a grin.</p> <p>"You can try talking about your experience with another woman. I'm not that big a person. Besides, I don't think I'll find it very difficult," I said grinning.</p> <p>"You can try doing it, but not all the way with me, ok?"</p> <p>"Ok. Tell you what? How bout we meet at a Starbucks over in Santa Barbara, get naked, then I bring you up and you can do whatever you want with me!"</p> <p>We went to the Starbucks and had a couple of lattes. He asked me to order for him, which I agreed to.</p> <p>Then, I told him that I was really sorry about all that happened with the other lady. She never liked sex as much as I like that, which means that I'm totally straight, which only makes me feel dirty.</p> <p>We sat in a row and had coffee. I was feeling so good about the whole experience that I'm pretty confident that I can trust him.</p> <p>"So how'd you like it to go through this?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yeah. What do you think?"</p> <p>"Good. I was afraid I might freak out if I did," I said.</p> <p>"Don't worry, honey, I've been totally honest with you. I'm a married man. No women in this town of ours, so I'm not the worst person you'll ever meet in a bar," he said with a wink.</p> <p>"I guess that makes me the worst guy in town," I said with a laugh.</p> <p>"What do you mean?" he asked.</p> <p>"You're the worst kind of guy in this town and I, you, I think you are. This is my story of what happened the evening I met my wife and my husband after I found out about it being the weekend."</p> <p>He had me blushing again, but he leaned over and gave me a warm handshake. He said it sincerely, and I felt a little better. We walked back to our car and I took a long hard look in his direction.</p> <p>"I'm glad you liked it," he said with a big smile. "I don't suppose you ever thought about trying different things with other guys, though."</p> <p>My jaw dropped. I was totally stunned. His reaction made me realize that he was still as cool as he always was in high school.</p> <p>"You don't think, that's gross?"</p> <p>"No. It's a little strange, but it's not gross. It's just that it's been so long... you know..."</p> <p>"Yeah, but I liked it. If that's why you liked it so much... It's all right." "What was it like? Having your first time with another man?"</p> <p>"I guess you could say that," he said.</p> <p>"Ok. So where we going?"</p> <p>"The beach, but we'll be there, so we'll stop in, ok?"</p> <p>"Ok, babe, but that's all I was asking..."</p> <p>"Sure," he said as he looked out the window of my car as we walked up the walk to my house.</p> <p>"Here we are! I'm excited to see you so soon, I'm so glad to finally meet you," I said as he got in and started his car.</p> <p>"So we've been going out for a while," he said.</p> <p>"Yeah. We haven't, well not really, really. I think it's just... I never knew it would be so fulfilling for other people... like... you... um... for me."</p> <p>"So now we're officially a couple. I've got some questions for you. I promise that I won't say a word about it if we're in the car."</p> <p>"Ok," I said. I thought I sounded like I could do it, but I wasn't sure how I'd feel likeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
