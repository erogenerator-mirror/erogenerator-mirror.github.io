"She always has been. She was a good swimmer back in her twenties." I'm about to take a sip of coffee when I hear a noise at the door. Startled, I look up at Sam. She's wearing a big robe around her waist, her eyes are glued to me. And the robe is unbuttoned all the way to her breasts. The robe falls open to reveal those beautiful breasts.</p> <p>"Is it you, Sam?" I ask. She nods, and sits back at the breakfast table. "I'm sure it is," I say and grab the coffee. We talk about our jobs and a variety of things and I'm getting excited to know a lot about her. I don't know if it would be a good idea to start with, but once I find out she's a big shot doctor, I'm in a better mood. "I've never been to see her before," she says, her voice husky. "I can't believe those things are on her. And I'm not really sure I'm ready for that."</p> <p>I sit back and take another sip of coffee. "I can't believe I'm finally beginning to appreciate what you two are doing, just not with each other." I shrug again, and sip my coffee. "I feel like I could be ready again by the time I leave," I say. I know I don't want to leave, but I might be. I mean, what guy wouldn't want to have a beautiful woman with a body like hers and he doesn't have a relationship that will work for both of them?</p> <p>"And I love the fact this is turning out just like last week," Sam says. "We're not sure if it was a bad idea to make love or if it was right for us both to do it because of the circumstances."</p> <p>"It's a good thing for us, or it could have been a worse thing for us," I tell her. "But we both know that doesn't change things between us. Our love lives are just beginning." She nods and sighs. "It's starting to make me question everything that's been between us," she adds.</p> <p>"There's a lot more to all this than I ever told you," I say, as I finish the last of my coffee. "Let me finish up and then we'll talk."</p> <p>Sam and I are in the kitchen making coffee and we look over the menu. Most of it is good, but it is very good, and I'm still wondering if we can eat it when she suddenly sits up in the chair and leans her head back against the back of the chair. I can see her chest rising and falling with each breath and my mouth waters at the sight of those beautiful breasts. She opens her robe to show me just a glimpse of her nipples.</p> <p>"It looked like a long flight," she says. "If you get us a nice dinner we can do that, just the two of us."</p> <p>She puts down her coffee, walks over and straddles my lap, facing me. I look up at her as she slides her hands up to my shoulders and holds me in a loving embrace. I don't get what I want and why I want anything, but I don't want anything else at this point. Sam doesn't seem to be a man, so what makes me think this isn't the end of it? The last few years is one of the longest periods that's happened to me in a long time, and the fact that I'm still discovering myself without knowing it. I'm in this relationship with a beautiful woman, who is clearly a lover and who can keep going for the rest of my life. And I'm still learning everything I know from the past, or more accurately, all of the past.</p> <p>Sam has her face pressed into my left shoulder in a soft soothing manner. I can feel her nipples against my chest through the front of her robe as I lean my hands down to gently cup her breasts. Her shoulders are so soft and warm, it feels like she has a velvet touch. The fact that she is still holding me brings out a certain vulnerability that we haven't felt on this trip. And now that we're all over the line, our lovemaking isn't as frequent as we'd like. We might as well be able to take our time now and enjoy a day full of new discoveries. We aren't taking our time and enjoying life. We are simply enjoying the fruits of our labor. If we're going to do anything else on this trip, we're going to do at least a little more than enjoy a day.</p> <p>Sam and I make small talk as we finish up the last of our coffee and eat our breakfast. She's really quiet now, just sitting and talking for a few minutes.
