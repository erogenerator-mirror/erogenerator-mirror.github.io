I asked.</p> <p>"Yeah?"</p> <p>"Do you really like it?"</p> <p>"Not really." She replied, "I just find it kind of embarrassing."</p> <p>"What kind of embarrassing?"</p> <p>"Your cock is small." She said.</p> <p>"Do you want to feel it?" I asked.</p> <p>Suddenly she said, "No! I've never done anything like that before! It's just a bit too small! I..."</p> <p>"Just like I said," I interrupted. "No hard feelings. Don't worry, I don't mind if you like it. We're going to keep it at the level you want it to be. Besides, I just don't know about guys liking doing that. It's okay though. I think it's quite normal to have sex with other guys."</p> <p>"But of course. Guys do this to women."</p> <p>"Well, not nearly guys."</p> <p>"Do you want to do it?"</p> <p>"Yes. Do you want me to have sex with you?" Linda asked.</p> <p>"Sure, if you want to, and I am the only guy you know with a huge erection."</p> <p>"Well, I haven't done anything with a guy."</p> <p>I agreed, as I sat on the sofa, and started to get up. I started to tell Linda that I couldn't take my clothes off, but that I wouldn't do this to her. So, instead, I sat there, with my dick standing up proudly on my thigh, and said, "Linda, I think you're beautiful and sexy. I really like the fact that you have a very nice figure."</p> <p>I stood up, still naked, and moved a little closer to where we were sitting. I leaned closer to Linda, and said, "Honey, your body is very nice. I'm surprised that I thought it would take me so long to get over a boner. If it's not too much trouble, I wouldn't mind touching you if you really want me to do that. What a pleasant surprise. You just need to show me."</p> <p>I stood close to her, and placed my hand on her bare knee. After a few moments, I softly moved my hand higher to her waist and slowly made my way slowly upwards. My dick was now standing straight out, pointing out towards her. Linda smiled at me, and leaned forward on the sofa. She had a hand down over her pussy. I leaned in, and said, "You can still feel my hard dick against your legs."</p> <p>Linda leaned back a little on the sofa, and said, "It's nice," and I could now get a good look of both her arms and shoulders. Her arms were not as slender as a lot of women, which only added to her overall attractiveness. I looked up at her face and told her, "Oh, you beautiful and sexy."</p> <p>"Can you touch my body?" she asked. She was now lying on her back, on the sofa, her arms draped over her body.</p> <p>I moved my hand down to her knee once in a while, but never actually touched her body. Not wanting to scare her off, I moved my hand up to her thighs. I looked closer and noticed that she had both legs spread apart.</p> <p>"What on earth is this?" I asked.</p> <p>"It's a sign that it feels good. It seems like when she cums."</p> <p>I continued to slide down the sofa until I was seated at the level of her thighs. Linda had her legs spread apart. Then, I moved up to her pussy. When my hand bumped her thigh, Linda jerked.</p> <p>"No! Don't touch my pussy!"</p> <p>I moved my legs a little further apart. "Honey, you are really smooth." She said. I moved my hand closer to her pussy, and said, "It feels nice." Then, I pushed my fingers gently, not very forcefully, between her legs. Linda's legs were slightly separated, so the motion of my finger touching her pussy was a little strange.</p> <p>"No!"</p> <p>I pushed one finger in and moved it slowly upwards. Soon, I felt her pubic hair. It felt nice. I moved my finger down a little, but stopped just before I would touch her pussy lips. I couldn't quite make out what her lips looked.</p> <p>"How much more will you put in?" She asked after a minute or so. It wasn't going to take much for me to make her cum, so I pushed my finger further into her pussy.</p> <p>Linda was breathing heavily. Her body was moving in time with my finger asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
