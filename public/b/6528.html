She stared at him, and she could feel his eyes on her back, his fingers lightly brushing the softness of her ass. She wanted him more than that.</p> <p>Suddenly they heard a giggle. "What the hell just happened!?" he exclaimed, and they went to find out.</p> <p>"My mom called..." he said, and it was the start of it. "She wanted me to see if I could take a shower. I was a little early... but I thought she might want me... to help with anything she might need."</p> <p>She was standing in front of the bathroom, waiting for him to close the door, and he had a towel in his hand. He had a smirk on his face, and it made the whole encounter seem even more weird and naughty than it was...</p> <p>She stood watching the water flow over him, and he had a smug look on his face and his eyes were glued to her. She felt a pang of jealousy on her own part, for what her son looked like...</p> <p>He turned and looked her in the eyes, his expression changing to something that made her feel ashamed...</p> <p>He leaned sideways, and ran his hands over her breasts again, and he began to knead them slowly again. He pulled her close and she closed his eyes against him.</p> <p>"That feels so good." She said, a little breathless, and he tilted his head back, giving her a warm smile. A grin, of course, and he leaned against the edge of the bathtub again, his hand sliding out of her wet shorts.</p> <p>She leaned against him, and she reached out and touched his cock through his boxers, his expression quickly turning to confusion for a second. She slid her hand up and down his erection, and he moaned against her fingers.</p> <p>He lifted his head and looked at her.</p> <p>"I see something you might like." She said, and he nodded.</p> <p>She felt his hand slide inside the leg of her shorts, and she froze for a second, looking at him as if expecting him to follow her.</p> <p>He nodded and took her hand in his, pulling it up to his mouth and kissing the knuckles. He smiled at her at once and closed his eyes again.</p> <p>"You can take your clothes off if you want... if you want to... anything." He said, and she nodded, watching him as if she was watching a movie.</p> <p>She felt his cock pressing against her stomach, and she lifted his hand away from her. She looked into his eyes as he pulled his boxers away, and she took his fingers in hers. She had never touched herself so intimately before...</p> <p>She put his hand back on her bare thigh and moved closer, putting her leg up against his and leaning up so her breasts were pressed against his chest. His hands were still caressing her through her clothes, and she leaned her face in again, and they shared a long, lingering look.</p> <p>"It's ok, you can go... you can be quiet." she said, and he nodded and followed her lead, letting her slip his hand under her shirt, and gently pull it up over her breasts.</p> <p>Now she was completely naked in front of his eyes, and she smiled at him shyly, and he laughed.</p> <p>"You know, we've had a lot of fun over the years." The voice came from behind her, and she looked over her shoulder to see Kate standing there, her hands inside her shorts, the only item of clothing covering her and her naked breasts, her hands under her shirt and brushing her nipples between her fingers. She smiled when she saw her and took a step closer to her.</p> <p>She looked into their eyes as if to confirm she was really OK with this. "Do you want to touch me?" she asked hopefully, just for his benefit.</p> <p>"Uh... I don't know... we just... um... I don't mean to be mean..." he said, looking back and forth between her nipples and the small, perky ones poking out from her bra.</p> <p>She raised an eyebrow. "Do not worry," she smiled. The smile was playful yet warm, and she brushed him playfully on his arm. "You can touch me, if you like. Just not here."</p> <p>He took his hand away from her, and she felt a surge of disappointment.</p> <p>"No, you can't. Remember we just came in...?" she asked.</p> <p>"No, what you just asked won't help." Her tone of voice showed some fear, but she did not pull away from him.</p> <p>"Please...." she whispered to him as she lifted her hips off of him.</p> <p>"I'll..." she hesitated.
