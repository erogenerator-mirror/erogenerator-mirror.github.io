I was not the kind to pick and choose. At least that what I had always considered. I had no idea of how best to go about dealing with the situation. For my part, however, I had just decided.</p> <p>We had become a bit of a friendly couple. We'd never done anything out of the ordinary or anything that should lead up to a relationship, but our friendship continued until the day my world changed at a fastish pace.</p> <p>My first major success in a long time had been by a group of girls on a very tight schedule so I went to great pains to bring it up with them.</p> <p>Most of them thought I was a real pervert when it came to the women I dated. It was just a little weird at first, but as I found, they liked it when I talked about my "exotic" relationships.</p> <p>As I got older, I had learned more about sexual situations in my line of work. I even went into the business and read erotic literature. I also had met a good friend who, at our age, seemed to be a little less promiscuous than he appeared. We hadn't even tried anything on a date yet and I really didn't know how well to go about anything with anybody else.</p> <p>That was my first big deal. The problem was how to act to go about it. I went out of my way to try to be a good boyfriend and try to make a little something of our relationship. I learned things a pretty good teacher would do.</p> <p>I was pretty good in bed...in fact, if I had a sex partner, I'd call them. I just couldn't bring myself to do anything with them and that worried me so much. I think I was the only one who had even attempted that.</p> <p>We started to have this one night stand. The guy was a real nerd. There wasn't anything good about that, but I tried to give him some. It didn't get us anywhere.</p> <p>We were having a great time together. Unfortunately the night really didn't end. Neither of us had plans for the following morning.</p> <p>The next night came and we just started to talk, but when the subject got to sex, we weren't sure that we were ready to do that kind of thing. We started getting seriously serious. We spent almost every night in bed, I mean our room. I'm a sucker for it, but there just wasn't that many of them who could take the pressure off.</p> <p>Then I got the chance. I came home with a box from the store this week and had to admit that I found a lot of what I had never had. The box contained my collection. From those items to the DVD, from everything my mind could think of, I had a collection that would go well with every fantasy I ever had.</p> <p>As the time seemed to come for us to move on, I began to get a little concerned about myself. There was something that was troubling me about this whole thing. Like I feared I would have to just take another step. But as I said before, I just knew it.</p> <p>It wasn't that I was averse to a guy fucking me. I was just a little worried that I wouldn't get what I wanted from him. I mean, he had a really big cock, but it took at least 20 to 30 years. I could see that in my head, right when I was ready. My fantasies were becoming fantasies. It also didn't hurt that he was in town to work. I wasn't so worried about him fucking me that he didn't bother to be on our side. In fact...I think it worked out great because we were friends then. I think he really liked me and I was a good girl. I think he really didn't want to fuck me.</p> <p>However, I never wanted to live like he did. I just liked him. He was my friend, our friends and the man of my dreams.</p> <p>My first mistake was to go out of my way to do something he wanted, like ask him...maybe even beg for sex. I told him he must have misunderstood me. I had never been with a guy before so I felt like I should just take the lead and give him what he wanted. I said goodbye and said "bye" over and over again at him for the next twenty or so years.</p> <p>However, something was up here. Something I had no idea how to handle.</p> <p>The next day I had finished the box and headed home to collect it. This time, however, I had to wait until I got to the end of the line and then I would simply disappear. There had to be something else, something that would be better than that and I needed to think about that.</p> <p>I called Bob and we ended up having aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
