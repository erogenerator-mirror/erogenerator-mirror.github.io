What do you think?"</p> <p>I got a nod and a kiss. Then he started to fuck me again while we both watched our friends and our wives in bed fucking for the first time.</p> <p>"I've always liked sex with both men and women," he said and I could tell he was getting close. I pulled off my panties and pulled off my bra, the wetter I was getting. "I think we ought to go over to one of the rooms."</p> <p>"There's a spare room!" I told him.</p> <p>When we were naked we went into the spare room. I had some paper towels there and had them roll down the middle of the room next to a window overlooking the city. Dan got a chair and we started to take turns fucking in there.</p> <p>"This is just for you," he said as he sat on the chair.</p> <p>We watched our friends, each man fucking another woman in it. We were getting very close though, and both guys came pretty hard. He finally sat up, reached down and started to jerk off.</p> <p>"I'm going to put on the rubber," I told him as I climbed back on the bed. Before he got on his cock, I said. "I want you to fuck me, Dan. I want you to fuck me like you fucked me."</p> <p>So he lay down and I lowered myself onto his cock. He was right. That was fantastic! The next thing I felt was his cock starting to enter me. I was so wet it slipped right in so easily it felt like it was going in all the way. There we were, with my back arched and my tits jiggling in the air, Dan fucking my ass, both of us getting off. I had both men moaning and groaning until neither one of them had lost control or climax.</p> <p>After they were done, we all took positions kneeling on the bed on all sides of the guys. They didn't last long getting their cocks in both our asses again and once again making us both cum.</p> <p>One by one we took turns being fucked in the ass or pussy either way. We switched places once Dan had cum in my ass while his other partner was bent over the couch doing the same thing. That night it went on for hours until all our orgasms were washed away in a few shots of spermicidal juice we'd taken before we were finally out of our clothes.</p> <p>After we all dressed we sat in the bar. That night we all just talked and made out for an hour or so. It got to the point where we were all naked and having a lot of sex, and I had an eight-inch cock when we left.</p> <p>We got together again and were so horny we just went to a bar. We spent the whole week together and fucked each other in all different places. Then the week before that we went to an all-night bar, and again fucked each other in the bar.</p> <p>That Tuesday was the last day before Christmas. Since that time everyone was staying at a motel to celebrate. It was Friday evening. I was wearing a tank top and panties as we were ready to go. I wore a skirt. We grabbed our coats and went out to the motel.</p> <p>We were out back in the parking lot and we were just getting into the elevator when we heard a door open. I looked across the parking lot to see who this was. I hadn't caught sight of anyone in the elevator.</p> <p>"Who is it?" I asked.</p> <p>"The guy who opened the door is my friend, Jason," Dan said as he got out of the elevator.</p> <p>"He went to the bar without saying who 'it' was."</p> <p>"I never thought of him as just another guy, but he didn't go to his room to get drunk."</p> <p>"I know, but I didn't think of him as just some guy that he'd picked up from the bar. In any case, you're right."</p> <p>We got to our room and he had brought a very good dildo. It was actually a pretty big one and was quite big and thick.</p> <p>"You sure know how to use that thing," he said as he laid on the bed spreading his legs.</p> <p>I knelt in front of him and rubbed the head of my cock against his hairy lips. I got the idea as I'd heard this guy would like me to bring a vibrator with me.</p> <p>He moaned and I moved the head to his hole. He spread his legs farther apart and I slid the whole thing into his ass. Once the head was in I moved it slowly, letting his muscles control when I was all the way in. When I pulled almost all the way out, he pushed back at me.</p> <p>"Fuck me, baby."</p> <p>"You ready for it nowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
