My panties were soaked. He picked them up, and held them up to my nose, inhaling my sex, smelling my sweetness all over.</p> <p>I pulled away. "No!" Then, I spread my legs, making room for him.</p> <p>He looked at his own crotch. It was soaked. It was glistening. He was wet. "I'm sorry," he whispered into my panties.</p> <p>This time, he held the back of my head lightly, pushing my head in my crotch, and pushed his face against my pussy, breathing my scent in. I spread my legs as wide as I could. I pushed my hips toward his face, and he eagerly licked up and down my slit.</p> <p>"Oh fuck!" I shouted out loud. With each thrust his tongue pushed my orgasm closer again. I felt like I would black out from the force of my orgasm. I wanted him to stop, but he kept going. I just lost it.</p> <p>"OH... FUUUUUUUUUUCK!" I screamed. I was totally out of control. I grabbed the sheets and cried out a high howl. I thrashed about on the bed, not stopping his rhythm. I came, and he just kept on. I could feel him getting softer. I heard his zipper release.</p> <p>He was on me, and I was still. And he was still, but...</p> <p>I felt his cock head at the entrance. "Wait!" I whispered, and he did, but then, I slid him down a bit.</p> <p>He pushed into me inch by inch. It hurt. It hurt, but it wasn't bad. It felt good. I had never been with a cock this big. But it was big, and it was stretching me open. It seemed to hurt, but I didn't know if it hurt. After a minute, I felt him pull out, and I knew it wouldn't be long.</p> <p>I felt him enter me again, and I couldn't help it. I just kept repeating the words I'd longed to hear, "Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me... Fuck me."</p> <p>He had been in me before, and I had been with him, and I loved it. For as long as I could remember. I wasn't sure if it hurt anymore, but it wouldn't be long.</p> <p>And then something new. "Wait," I murmured.</p> <p>"Wait," he mumbled.</p> <p>"Wait," I chanted. "Now," I urged him with each thrust of his hips. "Oh fuck, take me. I want your cock in me." It was the first time I'd ever used the phrase, but it was the first time I'd used it with anyone, and it was the first time I'd spoken it aloud. "Oh God," I moaned as it touched me deeper than even when he'd been inside me. I was losing. He was so huge, and I didn't know what hurt, but I needed to feel him explode.</p> <p>"Wait," he kept whispering. "I'm not gonna fuck you just yet."</p> <p>"You're so big," I mumbled.</p> <p>"Not that big," he murmured, and he just left his cock at an angle that made my pussy lips rub against it. "Relax."</p> <p>I closed my eyes, and held my position there, allowing him and his cock to go in and out of me. I did my best to keep moving up and down on his cock. I wanted to feel his cock inside me, and I wanted to feel everything, right there on the bed.</p> <p>Then, he pulled out.</p> <p>I looked over at his face a long time, and saw his lust-filled eyes, waiting, waiting. I opened them, and in his eyes.</p> <p>"No, just don't come yet for awhile, please," I begged him. He leaned down and took my chin between his two hands and stared deep into my eyes.</p> <p>"I don't want to hear no excuses to just finish in you. I don't think I can... You know, I don't care, I really don't want to. It's what friends do. You'll just have to ask..."</p> <p>"Please.... I don't want you... it won't happen again."</p> <p>"But then I won't be able to ask you again," he whispered. He kissed me gently on my lips. "I promise. Will it still be alright if we wait a little?"</p> <p>I felt him get up, and I opened my eyes to see him pulling the sheet off of me. "Why don't you go lay down and I will have a beer for you," I offered. "The couch's got a back and a bed," I added. So, I thought, "I don't thinkâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
