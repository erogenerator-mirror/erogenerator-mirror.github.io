And I really enjoyed it. It got me to thinking about a lot of things that I didn't understand at the time."</p> <p>"It got you to thinking of other things?"</p> <p>"Yup," said the other.</p> <p>"Oh no you haven't."</p> <p>They pulled into the club's parking lot.</p> <p>"What? How?"</p> <p>"It's kind of weird getting so used to being able to come up with these silly ideas," said the other, as she stepped out of the car, "but I don't think we'll ever be completely sober enough to have anything."</p> <p>"And you don't think we'd be able to live with some random guy or girls we met on the street any time soon? Or with us being naked in the car in public?"</p> <p>"And what's the point then?"</p> <p>"It's kind of hot. But we've already agreed there'd be no harm done," she said as she stepped into the club.</p> <p>"I see. Well, I guess its not all that bad. If you don't mind, I'd rather meet you then go," said the other.</p> <p>"I don't mind," said the other, taking her bag and leading her towards the door. "It turns out I like to drive and not be a spectator. I don't mind sharing a drink either if you'd like, but that's about it."</p> <p>"Sounds good," said the other.</p> <p>She followed the other into a hallway that led to a long bar in the back of the club, where they got a table. She took one of the beers that was on the table, and sat down at the bar, ordering a vodka tonic on the rocks. They sat across from each other, in a semi-circular booth, just two couples sitting in the middle. The table itself was only about three feet off the ground, and they couldn't see much through it. The lights were off, although the bar could still be lit up if it weren't for what they'd already agreed to share of the night ahead.</p> <p>"So, tell me a little about themselves," said the other.</p> <p>"Like what?"</p> <p>"Why did you decide it was okay for me to come here without a bra?" asked the other.</p> <p>"Don't tell me you didn't have a couple of drinks left?" said the other.</p> <p>"I don't blame you if you're like that," said the new, "and I'm not asking for your money."</p> <p>"That's not fair!"</p> <p>"A bra is a dress, right? And I know that I'd like to go to the men's room with you in less than one piece."</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she said as she handed her the half empty glass she had just taken out of the bartender's hand.</p> <p>"So, what's his name?"</p> <p>The other smiled. "Tom."</p> <p>"Hi."</p> <p>"That's my name. I'm Sharon."</p> <p>They all ordered drinks.</p> <p>"So, what happened, when were you guys going to finally get naked in your hotel room?"</p> <p>"We were just going to try everything before we decided how," said Tom, "as opposed to waiting for things to happen."</p> <p>"Yeah. We had a few drinks. The bar was pretty full, and one by one of us got undressed. It was pretty dark though, so the only light came from a neon sign hanging on the wall just a little further across the room. But I don't think we took too much time. I just had kind of a plan and ended up just trying things to see what happened."</p> <p>"Wait, did you just have a drink?" asked Tom.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"I was drinking, you know? Like three or four drinks. In the middle of our first meeting. A bunch of us decided to get naked. I figured it might be fun to just take my clothes off at the same time as you."</p> <p>"Don't say that," she said, a little shocked.</p> <p>"It wasn't too crowded though. We didn't know any guys around here and there weren't people in the pub to give us privacy," smiled Sharon, "so we only made small talk."</p> <p>"So you'll join us soon?" asked Tom.</p> <p>"Oh no," saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
