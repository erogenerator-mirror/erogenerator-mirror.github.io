What happened?"</p> <p>"The way it was, I think it will be a while before I'll be able to function. I can't sleep; I can't eat, only think about you and how amazing it is. I'm afraid of being unable to be with you," I said, hoping to put my head in my hands.</p> <p>"Me, too. That's the best news so far," He chuckled. "But, what about if I bring you home with me and you can give me this room?"</p> <p>I shook my head. "It's not that," I said.</p> <p>"It's just, if it's not too uncomfortable," He said. He smiled. "I love it when you think I'm kidding while we get to talk."</p> <p>"I'm afraid he could fall asleep on us," I said.</p> <p>"He could fall asleep on me anytime, and if I were you," He added.</p> <p>"That's the one I was worried about," I said.</p> <p>He stared at me. "I can't imagine a more perfect relationship."</p> <p>I laughed. "You're making me laugh, Eric."</p> <p>He smiled. "And it's a good feeling too."</p> <p>"So what do I do about you?" I asked.</p> <p>He shook his head. "Talk to me, Eric. I'll help you, and you can think about how good it will be. Talk. Think. Think."</p> <p>I was thinking, mostly, about what he said, and how I thought we could share these kinds of things with him. I'd really like to be his woman again. I think I'd like that. That's a hard way to describe to someone else why they want to be with this wonderful man, but you need to trust him.</p> <p>"We've just got to be very careful and keep this between ourselves," I said, trying to keep my voice from shaking.</p> <p>"You know, you really should go and get ready for our big date," He said, smiling at me.</p> <p>"I can do that," I said.</p> <p>He got up and started for the door. "We'll see," he said, and he was gone.</p> <p>I looked up at him in wonder again. He'd said something nice to me, but it'd just seemed too forward. "We'll see," I said. I was thinking of a way out of this, and I hadn't even come up with a plan, so I guess I could stay just my lover.</p> <p>Eric walked back into the apartment. I stood for a moment. I walked over to him, sitting, as though I wanted to say something.</p> <p>He nodded.</p> <p>I smiled. I was still uncertain. "We'll talk about it," I said. I pulled him into my arms, feeling content with how good he was to be with, and my mind was filled with other thoughts.</p> <p>*</p> <p>PART IIIâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
