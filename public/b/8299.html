You'll love it! Now it's your turn!" her voice had a slight chuckle.</p> <p>Her hand guided his face to my pussy and I gasped as he pushed his tongue between the lips and into my pussy. It didn't hurt a bit, in fact it felt rather good. I could feel his tongue working its way into my cunt and around my clit. I moaned and started to hump his face. Our fingers continued stroking and probing our most private hole. Soon our clits were rubbing each other and it felt as though we would cum at any moment. I couldn't hold on much longer and let go. "OH GOD!!! Oh fuck!" I felt it. "I'M CUMMMING!!!!!"</p> <p>"That was amazing."</p> <p>"Oh, I love to hear you talk like that, but thank you so much!"</p> <p>"I'll bet you say that every time you cum."</p> <p>"Of course you would!" I blushed.</p> <p>"Just remember you're my lover! I love to see you naked. Now it's time for an orgasm!"</p> <p>With that said she stepped back and slowly walked towards me as she grabbed my hand and pulled me to my feet. She started to slowly peel my clothes off. I still had on my bra and panties. Her hands slid under my panties and she slowly slid them off and tossed them onto the floor. I had on only a garter belt and her sheer silk panties, but they looked good on me. I felt her bare legs against mine and we embraced again.</p> <p>"Do you like how I feel? I took down my panties as she leaned her body against mine. Our lips met and our tongues met and danced. I could feel each of her hands stroking my face, neck and back. I could feel her tits pressing against me and felt a new excitement as her nipples and I became more familiar with each other. My arousal was growing and I could feel my excitement building. We kissed for a half hour and then she slowly pulled off her panties. The sight of her naked ass and pussy before me was incredibly arousing. But I couldn't go there fast enough. Before I knew it, my mouth was on her pussy as she grabbed hold of my head and forced it against her pussy. I could smell and feel the scent of her arousal and see and taste her excited pussy. She rubbed her pussy down my face and my arms were pinned under hers. I felt her hands on my head pressing me against her pussy. My tongue moved into her pussy as she moaned loudly.</p> <p>I licked and lapped up and down and up and down and up. She tasted amazing, and she tasted like heaven. Her excitement was growing and grew.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum!" I shouted.</p> <p>"Not yet!" she replied as she pulled her lips away from mine and started to kiss me.</p> <p>My own pussy was tingling and soaking wet. I thought I was going to climax right there as she continued. At that moment nothing mattered less of having my face in heaven! As she kissed and licked my pussy I started to shudder. The excitement and pleasure of being with her made me lose myself in her kiss.</p> <p>"Wow!" She giggled.
