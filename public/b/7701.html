He pulled her into his lap and she gave up all struggle. His lips met hers and they were full of hot passionate kisses. His lips felt nice and soft and it sent shivers down her spine. Her arms were around his head and her hands were on his head and holding him in. As they kissed passionately, her right arm had slipped around his neck. She could not pull it away, it felt so nice. All she wanted to do was kiss him all the way down and kiss him right back. His lips were so soft and warm. She could feel him growing in her arms. He was growing big and firm, like a big oak tree. His hands were all over her. She felt them rubbing her as he continued to kiss her and rub her with his hands. He felt her breasts swelling against him and they felt nice, full heavy and weighty, round and soft.</p> <p>His hands were everywhere, feeling her body, she felt his muscular legs and the muscles of his legs under his shorts. He had grown hard but it didn't show. He wanted her bad; he wanted her bad, he wanted to fuck her but he didn't have the courage to just come out and say it. He was going to be that bold, he didn't know where to go with it. He would have to have a plan so he could feel his cock and not be afraid to take a huge risk. He had to have her, to have her so badly that it would be a complete turn-on for her. He could feel his cock getting hard while he was kissing this angelic woman and he had to have her. That moment was a great moment, as the moment passed, there was only one thing left to do. They sat there, embraced and kissed and held each other for a couple more minutes. She wanted him so bad that she could not even think about stopping now. But this moment was perfect, like something out of a movie, when just two people could have sex, and it turned her on.</p> <p>"OK, lets have a shower and go to bed." He spoke and she followed him into the bathroom. It was large enough to shower and there was a marble floor, so it was very soothing.</p> <p>"Do you want me to go first?" He asked, still in a playful tone.</p> <p>"No, I'm wet enough now, so go!"</p> <p>"No! But I'm so stiff so go ahead and use your hand." He said.</p> <p>"No! I want this to be real, I want you first, I want you, don't think you're getting away with it!"</p> <p>He stepped in between her legs and pressed his body against her. His stiff cock pressed against her ass, and he pushed her back against the side of the shower.</p> <p>"You don't have to tell me, just use one of your hands." He said. She was surprised at the confidence in his voice. He had gone way more far than he expected in asking her first.</p> <p>"Oh well, it's OK, we can do that again later." Her answer was a little uncertain. He was so big her hand was getting sore. "It's OK." She was still worried.</p> <p>"OK?" He asked. It was then that he noticed her hands were trembling so he stepped in and helped her up. They hugged and kissed, and he felt good against her as he bent down and took her breast. She was standing in her heels as he sucked on her nipple. He turned her around and she got the idea quickly. She got on her knees and slowly bent at the waist, pulling her shoulders back and pushing her ass out. She bent it a little to emphasize it, then pushed it together enough to hold it. He was still in his shorts and she felt his hard cock. She reached up with one hand and wrapped her fingers around it gently. He had a very nice dick, nice and thick, she just licked his cock head.</p> <p>"I hope you don't think that's so much for your first time, because I just can't bring myself to do you in this position." She said matter of factly. "It's only if you take me."</p> <p>He leaned forward and gave her a slow, steady thrust forward. They stood, side by side, and he looked down and saw he own cock. She was a good inch taller than him and they both reached for each other. Their mouths touched briefly and soon he turned her around and kissed her.</p> <p>"Now let's put that thing in me." He said, breaking their kiss. He stood up from the shower and she took his cock and started to help. She could see him looking at her as she held his cock in her mouth, so she kept her mouth on it andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
