I exclaimed, trying to sound like it had been an enjoyable weekend to begin with.</p> <p>"Thanks," She said.</p> <p>"So how was your weekend?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Good weekend." She replied. So I knew she was just saying that, too.</p> <p>"Not much, eh?"</p> <p>"Nope. I'm pretty wasted anyway, but I got off work pretty quick." She replied. "How was your work?" she asked.</p> <p>"It was a decent workout. The meetings went really well for me. I didn't have to put on another uniform today though."</p> <p>"You're sure you didn't call?" She asked.</p> <p>"No, I told you everything worked." I said.</p> <p>"Yes, I'm sure." She said, looking around. It was really cute. I saw that she was getting nervous again. I decided to get into it.</p> <p>"So what are you doing? Why aren't you working?" I asked her.</p> <p>"I uh...I dunno. I haven't been...fucking around with one of my coworkers. It's got been a long week and I'm not feeling well." She answered.</p> <p>"Well that's okay. I'm sure you just went to bed," I said to her. She looked at me weird. "Why do you think I stopped by this morning?"</p> <p>"Well..." She said, looking at the clock again. I smiled. "I guess it was only a couple hours until lunch," she told me as she finished up with her shower. I could tell I was beginning to fall into the trap her life had been turning into.</p> <p>"I wouldn't really blame you for being pissed at me," I said, making it really clear to her that I wasn't going to stop by this time. In fact, if I stopped by a week from now, I might be tempted to do just that! "So, you want to come over here?" I asked her. I had a feeling my cock was going to get a little harder. It was about time.</p> <p>"Sure." She said. That was the best I could get out of my mouth, though I could tell she might not actually say no.</p> <p>"I can't wait to get to you." That was the nicest thing a girl could think of at that moment. I'm sure she was still thinking about how to put the moves on me.</p> <p>"So what do you need to do?" She asked me as we got out of the shower. I could tell she was still a little rattled by her reaction. I know. It didn't really go to her head, though. Her head was going off.</p> <p>"That'd be great if you would come out to my place at 4." There was this really devilish look in my eye as I agreed.</p> <p>"Sure!" She said. We got out of the shower and she followed me to my car. When we got inside I shut the door. And took control of the situation.</p> <p>"So, what are you wearing?"</p> <p>"Just a towel."</p> <p>"I can't believe you just bought me a top," I said, with more anger than I had ever felt in my life.</p> <p>"But I didn't." She said. "A couple of guys I work with have had plans, and I've been trying to work up the nerve to tell you to come over now. I don't want to ruin your new friend's chances with this guy. What do you think?"</p> <p>"Um...okay." She said, her tone becoming softer, more resigned. My dick was now a really hard-on, if you will.</p> <p>She went right over to me, and leaned in to kiss me. "So, what are you doing with her all of a sudden?" she said. That got a little louder after she said it. I got up and took her to the couch, where we sat there for awhile. She ran her hands over me, trying to make me feel like I was some kind of animal again. I let her play this. It felt like there wasn't any real way on some matters other than the sex life. I liked it, I liked her doing what she was doing. I felt weird but felt good at the same time, almost like having normal sex again. So, I sat there and just enjoyed it. It was pretty hot.</p> <p>"So," she said, "how are you going to find her?" It had been a while since we had spoken about anything. But I had to admit, I was hoping something like this would get my attention, or she could.</p> <p>"Your friend?"
