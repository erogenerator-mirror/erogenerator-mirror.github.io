I took off my bra, but left it on the bench. My nipples were hard and aching. I slowly rubbed them into my flesh. My nipples were still pink and red, as were my pussy. I slipped a finger inside, then a second. I felt my pussy quivering as my nipples got harder and more sensitive, but nothing was moving so much. I pulled off my pants slowly, looking down between my legs and seeing that my clit was now hard and throbbing. I continued masturbating as my other hand slid down between my legs and lightly stroked my clit. I had just come and I was feeling the energy of the day surge through me. Just knowing I was doing this made me feel more alive. I reached down and cupped my breasts.</p> <p>I was feeling bolder as my other hand took that which I was stroking my clit, but this one was teasing me more. I squeezed my nipple with my hand and felt it tightening inside. My other hand was still down between my legs and I gently massaged my clit as I rubbed my nipples. I came at a tremendous wave of pleasure. My legs shook as they got more fluid all over the bench. I couldn't get my breath. I kept masturbating, I felt the heat build and build as the orgasm flowed inside me. Finally, I just came, as the orgasm was subsiding, and I felt my muscles relax as the force of the orgasm wore off, for a few seconds.</p> <p>I slowly stood up and sat in the warm water, my legs feeling shaky all around me. I pulled off the remainder of my clothes. As I lay on my back in the water, my pussy still throbbing, I felt weak from the orgasm. I looked at myself in the mirror, my long blonde hair hanging wet, a dark pink flush on my face. "Now this feels nice," I said.</p> <p>The coolness of the water felt good on my tender body, but the feeling of pleasure was strong again. I turned over to lie on my back on the bench, thinking about coming up with a plan for the evening.</p> <p>I was a bit surprised when I heard the door open. I was lying on my back and no one was around. I felt sure that this wasn't an important part of my evening. I lay there trying to imagine what would happen in the past. It seemed that no one was here but me. My heart raced, but I could see it beating in my ears. I didn't even think about what I was wearing, it just felt right. I knew what I was going to do now.</p> <p>I heard the door to my room open and felt someone on the other side. I closed my eyes and felt my hand come in on the door handle. I felt someone take it and turn it. The handle slowly slid open and I heard a woman say, "You look wonderful tonight." I could only assume her husband was looking her over.</p> <p>The girl stood over me, looking down at me. I felt myself blushing and shivering as the woman asked. "So do you...?"</p> <p>"Yes," I whispered.</p> <p>"Well, I'm not sure what else to do," she said.</p> <p>"Would you...?"</p> <p>"Please do," the girl said.</p> <p>I felt the woman's hand touch my arm.</p> <p>"Do you know...," she asked.</p> <p>"Yes, yes, he... is still alive," I answered.</p> <p>"...he's in the hospital?" she repeated.</p> <p>I thought about it for a moment. "He says that's all he knows. He has been in the coma for a couple of days, but is being released by the doctors."</p> <p>"Okay. It really is nice to feel better after a bad day," she giggled.</p> <p>"So... you could be a real... a nice person to meet?" she asked.</p> <p>I thought for a second. "How else to you know if someone else is alive?" I asked.</p> <p>"Would you do that?" she asked.</p> <p>"Sure, that would be nice," I said.</p> <p>She laughed and reached out her hand to take mine. "I'm Sally. I'm glad to see you. If you ever have the time, give me a call."</p> <p>I didn't know how I felt, but I knew that this had to be something. I turned onto my side and looked at her. "That would be nice," I said softly.</p> <p>She smiled. "Maybe I can see you," she offered.</p> <p>I did a little bump in the seat, but it was nothing muchâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
