Who knows? Maybe I'll be there again some day? Just to sit with her at her house.</p> <p>But how?</p> <p>I'm in love with this girl.</p> <p>Maybe we can get married.</p> <p>Yes. Yes we can.</p> <p>What are we going to do?</p> <p>I want to take my chances.</p> <p>But we're not going to marry.</p> <p>Well, why not? It's no contest. We're not going to go looking for a quickie; we're going to get married.</p> <p>Okay, that's not an unreasonable proposal. So, that's what I thought.</p> <p>I need you to move somewhere special that you can't get rid of.</p> <p>I can't.</p> <p>Why not? It might be fun. So, I guess I'll live on the streets until I can find a place for you.</p> <p>Maybe. You want some peace and quiet?</p> <p>She's not home?</p> <p>It was the least I could do.</p> <p>Maybe.</p> <p>If you like.</p> <p>I need to do a search.</p> <p>Please?</p> <p>Okay.</p> <p>She is just the prettiest girl in the world. She's my mom's younger sister with her parents. It doesn't matter who, what, where or how to marry her. It's just as well that she gets her hands on you and then I can tell you when she's ready to join in the fun. Okay?</p> <p>Do I get to talk to her some other time?</p> <p>Sure. There is a small bar on the left-hand side of her house.</p> <p>She's got to be there before noon. If we're not there by then. We'll have to walk down one of the streets looking for another street, just to be sure.</p> <p>Good idea, she'll be there before noon. You know the routine.</p> <p>I can't just walk in front of her, so I'll need to wait outside, in a dark alley, while I wait for her.</p> <p>Okay.</p> <p>What's there is a spot with some trash on the right-hand side and another right-hand house just a few yards down. We would have to walk in front of it and wait. We can have our talk there.</p> <p>She looks like she's a bit younger, almost. She can be a very pretty girl with a body who looks and doesn't say shit. I like the way she wears her dark hair and wears her glasses when she's pissed. She's got a great body.</p> <p>She doesn't seem too interested in me.</p> <p>No. I don't give a damn. Besides, it's only the first of several times we'll see each other.</p> <p>And what about the time when I'm home?</p> <p>The answer is yes. Maybe we'll find a couple of minutes and have an hour or two without talking.</p> <p>Okay. I'm interested. She's cute.</p> <p>Maybe she's not looking a lot at me.</p> <p>I know she is.</p> <p>We'll figure it out.</p> <p>So, there's no problem.</p> <p>See, if something happens, I'm okay with what happens.</p> <p>Let's get started.</p> <p>She's cute, alright.</p> <p>So, let's start our little day.</p> <p>She takes a look at my face, and then it disappears a bit. She looks down and I watch her, and feel the eyes of my friends all over there, look at the faces we see.</p> <p>Then, she looks up and she smiles.</p> <p>I say something and she smiles up.</p> <p>Is, she looks a bit young or something?</p> <p>I really don't care.</p> <p>I really don't know.</p> <p>I'm her, and we get on with getting married.</p> <p>We go down the street. I get to the spot where she was looking at me.</p> <p>She looks at the other homes up. Can't they be a day of peace and quiet, and just be happy? They aren't, are they?</p> <p>Maybe. No. Are you just excited?</p> <p>I just don't think you can wait that long, she's not going to get any help from me and her parents right now.</p> <p>I really don't like waiting on you at this hour.</p> <p>I really don't think so. No. I'm sorry, I am, I am.</p> <p>You got to ask me something.</p> <p>I can tell she can see me looking at her.</p> <p>I can also see her looking down at me as wellâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
