"No, we don't have to do anything. We could go back to your place." We both took her hand and walked to the restaurant. When we passed by the entrance, I felt a sense of unease. Not that I was upset with this. At least, I was the only one in the crowd.</p> <p>"Did you just fuck me in the ass with your penis?" I asked, trying to keep from raising my voice. The idea that we could make out in public was too much. She shrugged nonchalantly. Then it struck me, as if she had the same idea, she had the idea that she was going to fuck me without a condom. "I...I mean, yes."</p> <p>"So did I," she replied noncommittally. I could hear the smile in her voice. It was one of those moments when the world stops spinning and you're suddenly sure that you're just walking on water. She knew just how to drive me crazy and I didn't want to move an inch.</p> <p>We arrived at the restaurant and she led me in, where she took out a napkin and cleaned it up while I paid the cover charge. When she was done with it, she offered to pay for the food, which I declined. "So, how do we get home?" I asked, looking into her beautiful face.</p> <p>"If you're going to make it without me, then I think it would best you get to sleep somewhere else. I like your company," she said, as she slipped her hand into mine and pulled me into a long kiss. Our mouths were still touching, but I could feel it starting to grow. I knew that all I could do was to keep going until we went somewhere else.</p> <p>The meal was excellent, so I didn't have to fight at all. I decided to have a drink, too. A little Dutch courage never hurts. We ended up watching the movie and went to our couch. I sat so close that my shoulder blades were touching her shoulder. She was on her hands and knees looking at the stars, which were starting to get closer.</p> <p>She lifted one ass cheek and gave me a glimpse from above. I didn't really understand what she was doing, but I didn't mind. All of a sudden, her face came into view. She was a little shy at first, but when I looked into her eyes and saw all the desire and desire in her eyes, I found my heart skipping and my blood heating it up. Our eyes connected, as we saw each other's desire, and our desire started to take a life of it's own.</p> <p>After a minute or two, she started to pull her skirt up. I took it off as slowly as I could. She kept the hem just below the swell of her breasts, so that they swayed slightly and then dropped to her waist as she moved her hands to her side. I followed her lead, taking off my shirt as we continued to watch the stars move closer and closer to them.</p> <p>I got up to my knees and dropped onto the couch. She was on me for the first time that evening, her body riding me, her breasts pressed tightly against my chest. She came, and that was it for my mind as well as my body. When I did, too, the first spurt of spunk shot straight up between her legs and down onto myself. By my reaction to the feeling of her cum, I'd gone through an orgasm that would've been painful had I not been so turned on.</p> <p>We lay in each other's arms for some time without speaking. I don't think I felt that any words had even entered my mind. Maybe it was the booze. Maybe it was the thought of what could happen in the world of the living. But I felt good about what we had just done. It felt right. It really felt good. My mind drifted back to the first time I'd masturbated, remembering how wet I was when I fingered myself down there. I smiled at the memory. My own orgasm was a couple of minutes ago. I thought about that, too, when I masturbated. I was so turned on by what had just happened.</p> <p>I got up to check out the time, getting ready to grab the last of our beer for later. I got back to the couch, feeling like a king on a throne. I had made it all this way, and it couldn't get any worse.</p> <p>"What did you want?" she asked, as we were sitting up on the couch, drinking our beer. She'd only been drinking a little, but she was definitely feeling better.</p> <p>"Oh, I guess you already knew that I was going to cum again. Now you're really going to have to wait until I can get hard again."
