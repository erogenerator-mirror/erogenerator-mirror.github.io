I laughed, shaking my head as I said that.</p> <p>He smiled. "You can't think of her as a boy, can you?"</p> <p>"Actually," I agreed, "she'll always be with him, will ever, and we'll never change."</p> <p>"We just met her yesterday and I know she'll be with you forever," his voice said with just a hint of regret in it, "and if you ever decide to do anything with her again, just say our names, and she'll never worry a thing!"</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sure there will be time for her on occasion," I agreed without thinking about it very much. Just knowing that he hadn't told me the night before really meant a lot to me.</p> <p>"Let's go home, shall we?" he asked.</p> <p>"Where do you want to go tonight?" I asked wondering how he could tell that there would even be anything between us. My heart was telling me he wasn't kidding, he had to be kidding.</p> <p>"Let me get us some beer," he said walking into the kitchen.</p> <p>As he came in he saw my feet. "You really need to go to the men's room," he said looking right at me with a smile on his face.</p> <p>"I thought I would have the time to shower," I said, laughing.</p> <p>"Well...I don't know...I hope you're not going to try to hide your condition..."</p> <p>"I won't try to hide it," I said, "but this should be funny, you know?"</p> <p>"I don't know," he said.</p> <p>"Me either," I shrugged my shoulders.</p> <p>"Well, I want to go home and think about it," he told me, giving his friend a quick kiss on the cheek on the way out. "It could be a while before we hit the sack," he reminded me.</p> <p>Once on the highway I tried not to think about the conversation, thinking about what may or may not have happened between him and this boy in the car. I decided to go out with an idea; if I was going to meet with some of the boys again, it would be my first trip home.</p> <p>I thought it over and decided I should try it and if it worked out I would have no problems telling Tom about it. That would give his friends a chance to get to know his other half as well.</p> <p>I decided it would make a good joke to make sure it didn't cause any problems for my dad. With that in mind, I called him up and asked if he had heard what I said. He said I was joking and couldn't tell anyone at work. I just giggled as he told me to take his mind off it. I wanted to go back after work, get all that good wine and chat with my cousin until I finally found the courage to come to him.</p> <p>"It's just you, isn't it?"</p> <p>"Yes, and I think we need to get home to my father," I nodded, trying to keep my face calm. I knew it was a little silly, but I was starting to think about how he had treated the other boys I had been with. If it could come back to him, as he would eventually tell me, or if I could let them tell my dad, maybe I could even help him get on with life.</p> <p>I got a kiss in our direction just as we turned the corner to drive down the highway to get to the house. It was a short drive into the house and as quickly as it came, the car was turned around and pulled out. My cousin's heart was beating in his chest as he took my hand in his. "Come on," I said to him, "let's go into the living room, make yourselves comfy."</p> <p>"It's just me," he insisted, "and I think we should come home."</p> <p>I led him as we walked into the living room where the two boys were standing looking at one another like old friends.</p> <p>"Good morning," I said to them, trying very hard not to let them see my confusion.</p> <p>"Good morning," he said, returning my smile.</p> <p>"Did you guys have a good night," I wondered how he could even be surprised and not want to see his mother and he and his wife getting it on. I hadn't even seen him kiss one of the guys before.</p> <p>"Very good day," he said to me, kissing me on the cheek.</p> <p>"Please hold on to one another until after we eat breakfast," I told him, making sure toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
