Rachel asked her friend as they climbed in bed.</p> <p>"About five, it's about an hour walk from the house?" Rachel said. "I'm pretty sure we'll be fine by the time you get there."</p> <p>"Not even close," Emily said.</p> <p>"Yeah, I know," Rachel said. "I think that's gonna be a surprise now, though."</p> <p>"I'll be there early. We've got a long day ahead of us!" Emily laughed.</p> <p>************</p> <p>"He must have a hard time finding me." Megan said as she sat in the passenger seat. She stared at the redhead. "It's all you, isn't it?"</p> <p>"I think I'll just be here for the drive," Megan said nervously.</p> <p>"Let's get it on then," Megan said with a shrug as she put the car in gear.</p> <p>"That still leaves us," Emily said as they got to the airport. "We're probably gonna go get a room for a few days."</p> <p>"I'm so glad you've got a room," she said, looking off into the distance.</p> <p>"I know," Megan said with a grin. "And I wish we could do this forever. But now I guess we're just the two of us."</p> <p>"Megan!" Rachel cried out. "He's not going to stay with you for that long!"</p> <p>They heard Megan's footsteps on the way on the gravel driveway of her new house. They had left her car keys in her handbag on the bed of their large white Chevy. Rachel took it from her fingers and opened it. "Just drive, ok?"</p> <p>"Sure," Megan said with a grin. "And don't worry about me! Let's just get this done," she said and she quickly ran back to the house. Rachel was surprised to find her cell phone dead. She knew he'd be gone all day for a good part of the day.</p> <p>They drove away from the airport once they got a few hundred yards out of sight of the city. When Rachel's car turned into a long gravel driveway, she got out. She didn't want to walk along the dark side lane like she had before, even if their car was a little ways past the house. She ran into the nearest door and almost knocked.</p> <p>"Hey babe, just making sure you're ok," Rachel breathed. "I'll text you the address and I'll come down and get you."</p> <p>Rachel unlocked the door, got inside and walked to the back of the house as Megan walked toward her. She opened the door and smiled at the sight of Megan standing there in a pink nighty that barely hid her nipples.</p> <p>"I'm ready when you are," she said.</p> <p>"Oh, I was just going to take a shower," Megan said with a smile.</p> <p>"You know it! There's been no showering in years and it has a lot to do with that!" Rachel said, putting more energy into the conversation. Rachel turned to walk away, her eyes roaming over Megan's gorgeous body. "Just don't be out all night, ok?"</p> <p>She watched Megan's shapely ass as she walked away. Rachel had to admit, a part of this sexy woman was worth having on the side like that as well as being on the street. She didn't think she would have the nerve to walk down to the hotel and pick up a strange man. Or even get the man she thought she wanted. They had plenty of time to go shopping later. She looked around. Most of the lights were off except for one small streetlight. She quickly turned and checked her phone for a text message. She saw that a text had been sent to Megan the day before. It read 'It's about you.' As she looked at the text, she couldn't help but smile. Her boyfriend had been texting her back all night.</p> <p>****</p> <p>"I'm surprised that he's gone all this time," Emily said. "I thought he had been missing for ages."</p> <p>"He really is a beautiful guy," Rachel said. "You'll find out just how beautiful he is when you're ready to say the words."</p> <p>Emily had been waiting for Rachel's reply as long as she could. It wasn't what she had intended to say, but it was what she expected. She decided to let the subject drop.</p> <p>"Hey Rachel, you up for a drink?" she heard a woman's voice say behind her. Emily turned around and saw Jessica leaning in front of her, her arms folded in front of her chest. On the opposite side of the bed was Kelly and her boyfriend were also on the bed naked.</p> <p>Emily's breath caughtâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
