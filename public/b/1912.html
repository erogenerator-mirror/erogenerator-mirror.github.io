Then, he started back again! She couldn't tell if he was going to start back over, or keep his pace... but he seemed inordinately steady. Then, he stopped again. She moaned in disappointment. But then again, she was hoping he was going to move on to the next piece, and get this done.</p> <p>He paused, and then went back to the beginning of her neck. Her skin tingled in anticipation of this new sensation, but then she felt the tension at her collar line as he applied tension there. "Oohhh," she muttered. She could feel the tension at her collarbone. It was as if the tension he applied to her with his fingers had gone into the muscles in the column of the collarbone. "M-mmm-hmmm," she was moaning.</p> <p>He moved down to her collarbones, lightly brushing his fingers across both the skin at the top of the collarbones as his hands reached to the middle of her chest. She could feel his fingers trace over her nipples, and felt the electricity shoot down her body to her groin as he did so... She was sure his fingers weren't on autopilot now, as their focus was solely on her body and mind. "Shit," she thought. "I'm not that hot yet. "</p> <p>His hands were still on her breasts, but now he was working his way south, towards his goal. He took just the tips of both nipples at the end of the collar bones where her breasts met and circled the entire upper slope. His fingers moved quickly to her abdomen and he lightly pushed against the elastic band of the shirt as he went to the left side of her shirt.</p> <p>She moaned again. His hand was on her stomach now, not touching, but definitely massaging. He moved the fabric away from her bellybutton. Her shirt was tight, it would not stretch easily, although she could feel herself being lifted off her butt. He moved down to her waist band, and she felt him pull upward slowly on her panties.</p> <p>"Uh-huh! Yes, definitely!" she thought.</p> <p>She had forgotten about her legs. There were some things, it was just instinctive. Now, she wanted to feel him touch her, but it wasn't right to rush it now. She just wanted to feel him.</p> <p>He pulled the panties off and tossed it away, exposing her mound to his gaze. She had trimmed the hair just above it, and he could see that she had a neat little muff between her legs. But now, there would be no hair there to hide when he moved. She heard him pull up her shirt again, and she felt her eyes widen once more.</p> <p>It looked like a tattoo. Maybe it had the same characters the characters on her chest had, but something else. It was the same tattoo that was tattooed on her throat. The next part was the same in the same place, and only the end of it was scarred. It looked like a cross. "Oh my gosh!" she thought. "It looks like a cross! The cross has the initials 'SHHHHH' on it." She looked up at him, and he looked back at her. "I think that means 'Shithead'!"</p> <p>They looked at each another for a brief second, and then she realized that they weren't looking at the tattoo, but the cross of "SHHHHH'S!" on the top of her left shoulder blade. It took her a second to realize what it meant. She could see a tiny red, pouting opening where the "shoulder blade" had been, just to the right, just a few inches from that opening.</p> <p>He quickly took the cross away, and replaced it with his fingers, running them down the outside of her thigh.</p> <p>"Oh fuck," she exclaimed, almost as if she was saying "Oh my gosh!" on a regular basis, but he only gently stroked her left thigh with his finger, then his hand went to her left knee. He put the tip of his finger on the opening and gently pried it open, taking in her scent with his nose. He put his head down on her right knee, his face about a few inches from her skirt...and she instinctively raised her right leg over his lap. That was it. Everything else vanished.</p> <p>He took his finger away. He wanted to look at her face, but she was too far out. She was breathing too fast for her to continue, but his face was right there on her knee, inches from her skirt. He could smell the musky scent of her arousal, like a little fish, just above the water. His lips were slightly parted, and he was biting her lip so hard it was making her moan. She took two hands to hold herself up and the skirt had slipped upâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
