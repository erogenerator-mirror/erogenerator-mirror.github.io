I had my hand between my legs and started stroking faster. It was just as good for Jenny and I when I got my wife to come.</p> <p>"Oh baby, he didn't even touch me there. I'm coming. OH! Oooooooooh. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh. Oh God! Oh God that was fantastic! Fuck! That's it! I'm coming! I'm coming!"</p> <p>I had to hold onto my chair so I wouldn't fall off the wall. I finally let go, but I was afraid she would fall. I was getting so desperate to cum, that I couldn't help it.</p> <p>Jenny pulled me gently to her, and as our lips met, our tongues could do just a quick lick. Our hands explored each others bodies, playing and exploring. We made out for a few minutes. She got up on the bed next to me and fell back.</p> <p>Jenny's hands were all over my body, and my hands roamed all over her soft body. I ran my fingers through her wet hair, across her shoulders, down to her breasts. Her breasts were so soft, just the way you'd want them to be.</p> <p>My cock was getting hard again, and getting ready to come. I didn't care. I wanted to feel and suck all of her and have that beautiful pussy. I needed to taste her just like I had my wife. I took my cock in my hand, still hard and standing, and ran it back and forth across her pussy lips.</p> <p>Jenny grabbed my cock with one hand and guided me into her. Then I could feel that wonderful liquid flowing out of her. It tasted sweet and tangy, but felt so good.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum again, honey. Fuck me. Make me cum," she told me.</p> <p>We did, for a few minutes. Then she slid down on me, taking me inside of her. I couldn't do anything like that, because Jenny knew it just wasn't the right place and time for her, too. She took me as deep into her as she could, and her eyes closed.</p> <p>Her pussy was so wet, that I knew she had been fucked hard. Her hands were wrapped around my shoulders, guiding me, guiding me to the right spots whenever she wanted to hold me off by just a little.</p> <p>My cock was feeling so good inside of her. Every time I slid back out, I could have a dream about having my dick inside of her. It was wonderful to watch her take me, and feel her body, while I fucked it.</p> <p>It was wonderful to feel that tight hole on each stroke. It was unbelievable! And I got it from her without taking it from me. It's not every woman you see in a movie. But, it was so good to feel the love, the devotion, the love that she had for me.</p> <p>I know it feels weird, but even though I've had Jenny before in every form, she was a married woman, and I was her boyfriend, and I was giving her the sex of her life. That was really a gift I had not given to Jenny, who never wanted it and never wanted my love.</p> <p>She was the one who was always my special one. I have to think that she knew I had made the mistake our spouses had made. I couldn't do this to myself. I had to leave her and think about what we would be doing. I really needed her and that was what I needed.</p> <p>I started thrusting with abandon, feeling so much love and lust for her, so much affection for her. I was making love to this wonderful woman who made me a man. Yes! Yes! And this woman, my wife that I have wanted for the longest time, and loved more than her own life could ever possibly.</p> <p>I felt like a lucky young man in love. There was no other way to put it. I was going to do this with my hot, sexy wife. I could feel my cum racing to the surface, just as it was racing home. I was going to come inside of her, and she knew that.</p> <p>I had to make this wonderful woman climax with me. I knew I wouldn't last much longer. I never made a woman climax this good. This would be the most intense sex that I ever had. I couldn't ever imagine having sex with any woman like that.</p> <p>It didn't feel like that to me, but I thought about it. I thought about feeling it come from us. That felt wonderful, that felt so special. It felt like I had been in a dream. With no one to share it with. That felt so good, I want that. I can feel how much you're giving to me. So intense when you touch me.</p> <p>"Oh Jenny, thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
