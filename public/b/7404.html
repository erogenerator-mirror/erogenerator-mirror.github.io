"I mean, it's just..."</p> <p>"It's no big deal!" I said, and looked back toward the road. "It is, in fact."</p> <p>"Oh, my! I see, you have been in here too many years!"</p> <p>"No," I said, "not only have I, but I've had many girlfriends, too."</p> <p>She blushed, and the two girls laughed, before a younger man approached me.</p> <p>"Is this Tom?" he asked, coming over to the driver's side.</p> <p>"Yes, Sir," I said.</p> <p>"How may I assist you, Sir?" he said.</p> <p>My eyes followed his eyes, and lingered a little too long in the rear view mirror.</p> <p>"My name is... . . . ." I stammered.</p> <p>"My name is Sir, Sir!" he said to me.</p> <p>He smiled, his eyes twinkling, and then he looked back toward the road before turning, walking quickly, and returning to the car on the opposite side.</p> <p>"Well," he said, "you seem to have grown up together, young lady."</p> <p>"Yes, Sir," she said. "It's been fun, Sir. And it's been a nice day."</p> <p>"Yes," I said, looking back toward the road, "but I was actually just looking at the scenery. Would you mind if I rode down toward the river, by the way?"</p> <p>"Oh, of course," she said. "But, Sir?"</p> <p>"Just drive by the main roads," I said.</p> <p>She nodded, and I pulled into a stop on the street, and followed her around.</p> <p>"Oh, yes, it is quite," she said as she leaned forward to reach for her purse on the ground. "You see, Sir?" she said as she handed me the car keys. "We live across the street."</p> <p>"Where are you headed?" I asked.</p> <p>"No, Sir," said the young woman, "I'm just driving by a park."</p> <p>"A park?" I asked. "How would you know, Sir?"</p> <p>"Just take me in, Sir," she said as she held up her purse, letting me lean forward to retrieve hers.</p> <p>"OK, then." I said, picking her up off the ground, and tossing her down the center aisle.</p> <p>"And," I said to the young couple, my eyes meeting hers, "that's your name, now?"</p> <p>"Yes, Sir," he said as he held out his hand. I shook his hand, and his eyes lit up.</p> <p>"That was very kind. Very welcome, Sir," he said.</p> <p>"I've heard a lot about you," I told him. "But you're probably too young. I'd really like to see a real man," he said as he looked up and down her body, before turning to the woman. "You'll probably like what I'm about to show you."</p> <p>"May I? May I take him in?" the older lady asked.</p> <p>"Uh-huh," he said.</p> <p>"Oh, sure. Of course!" she said, before turning to walk back to the car.</p> <p>My eyes followed her every move, especially her rear. I glanced back at the road as we drove, and then glanced down at the ground. I shook my head, and turned to meet hers in the doorway.</p> <p>"Please wait until it's dark, Sir," said the woman. "Then take him into the park. Come on," she said, and headed for the car.</p> <p>"But surely you're not going to tell anyone?" I asked.</p> <p>"Oh, no," she smiled, before returning to her seat behind the wheel, "he's my boyfriend, Sir."</p> <p>I sat and wondered aloud. I felt that I could finally have it, and then I knew why I felt that way. As we passed the entrance to the park a very attractive woman, a brunette of somewhere between 20-something, walked quickly, to meet up with me.</p> <p>"Hi, Sir," she said, smilingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
