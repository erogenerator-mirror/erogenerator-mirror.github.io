He smiled at her with that stupid grin and she smiled back at him; so alike, in kind. She had to see it.</p> <p>"Would you please touch them?" she begged, eyes brimming.</p> <p>He reached for her foot, pulling it toward his face. He placed his hands on it and ran the fingers from her foot toward her ankle. She moaned and wiggled.</p> <p>He moved the fingers of both hands over her toes and looked up.</p> <p>"Ohh, that feels sooo good, Mike. And, it's not just my feet that feel sooo gooooood there. Do you feel those nipples?"</p> <p>His face was a mess from her teasing, but he did feel them. And it made the blood run right to his dick, which seemed to grow even harder.</p> <p>He kissed the sole of her foot and then began doing the same to her calf.</p> <p>She kept her legs closed and held him in her little arms so that he could barely breathe. His eyes were closed and he knew he wanted to just sit there and watch. He wanted to hold her like this forever, but he remembered he was here. He wanted to be here, but he knew he wasn't allowed to move his head away until she was satisfied and he knew that he couldn't.</p> <p>She put her hand on his nose and held him close as he kissed her foot. She closed her eyes for a split second so that he would have that little contact. Once he let his eyes open, the only thing holding them closed was their faces touching. It was more than he could really feel, but he couldn't help the way she looked at him.</p> <p>It was so fucking hot. The way she looked at him, the way her body moved with his fingers as they moved up and down, up and down. She opened her eyes and looked at him.</p> <p>She said "Oh, Mike! That is soooo good. That feels amazing. Oh, oh, oh! Now it's me doing it, not you, okay?" she said.</p> <p>He was in absolute heaven. He nodded yes, and started rubbing his face against her foot. He had to be able to take it back, but it sure was different. Her big toe slipped through his lips and he could just barely breathe. He could hardly wait to have this foot in his mouth. She seemed to take no prisoners and she kept her legs closed for him.</p> <p>He reached up and grabbed her leg, pulling her back. She grabbed his face in her hands and kissed him again.</p> <p>"Thank you so much, baby. Thank you so much." she said.</p> <p>She pulled him with her as she climbed off the couch and walked away. He followed her out onto the patio. She put his arms around her and hugged him tightly. He realized she was going to say something and he began to try to figure out what to say.</p> <p>She didn't. Instead she got up and put her fingers in his mouth. She turned him around and pressed him against the house.</p> <p>"Suck them, Mike. Use your hands all over my feet." she said softly.</p> <p>He nodded.</p> <p>"Okay, now just do whatever you do, lover." she said. "Suck them, do whatever you do, and when I tell you to stop, you do it, you do it, and you'll do it. They won't even hurt and I don't care. That's all for you."</p> <p>He nodded again as she opened his robe, pulling it off of him. She looked down on him. He couldn't see her expression. He had no idea how much she wanted him to do whatever she said. He reached up and put his hands under the sheet and pushed her down on it.</p> <p>She went with him.</p> <p>He did whatever she told him to do. He didn't have to wonder. He knew.</p> <p>His face was wet with her juice. She was already aroused and had a raging hard-on, a cock which she was making hard with her hand. And he wanted to make the most of that.</p> <p>"Okay, Mike. Lie back and suck my toes, just like I'm going to do to you later," she said, running her fingers over his scalp and down towards his ear.</p> <p>His hands were still tied but he could do it, but he had to go all the way.</p> <p>She reached down and put both feet on his chest, then put hers on his face.
