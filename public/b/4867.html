And that felt so good that the tears started to run down my face again. I don't think I had ever been so glad to be on any form of birth control, even at a time like this, with my body betraying me and my mind betraying me and my body's reaction. For the first time in my life, I felt a man take charge again, fuck me, and then fuck me hard, deep, and make the world go around for me.</p> <p>My whole body tingling with every thrust he plowed into me, I moaned in pleasure and lust as we came down, and my screams turned into moans of pleasure and cries of love. My legs felt weak, my toes curling with shock and excitement the orgasm had nearly destroyed all other resistance, and when it came, it was powerful, and powerful. As the waves of pleasure coursed through it, I had never felt anything so intense in my life, and while I was on the brink, as another hard cock fucked me hard and fast, I realized that it was not just a dick, it was another.</p> <p>Once he got back into me, he pounded away at me relentlessly, his breathing heavy with desire. He pulled out of me, flipped me over and rammed back in, just as hard as before, and it was only when the waves were receding completely did I realize I had cum. Once again, I was cumming, and screaming my entire body up and into him.</p> <p>Once again, I fell forward on the bed and he rolled me over and put himself underneath me. He continued to ram into me and bang away at my body, but I was still on top of the world, and all of a sudden we heard the sound of the shower from outside. He began to pull his penis out of me and I turned my head, trying to see who it was, but there was no one there. So, suddenly, I felt the shower turn on again. I looked in panic, but this time he didn't make any head moves, he pulled my hips down onto him and thrust back into me as I felt a finger pressing into my ass. I couldn't see, but I could tell it must be the same one that had penetrated my mouth earlier. I wasn't worried at all since, if anyone walked in on me, I would be fucked over the shower floor again, no matter how much someone enjoyed being raped by a whore.</p> <p>I had thought we were done, but suddenly he was pumping his cock as deep as it could go, and it was time, even if the shower had stopped to let me recover. My heart thumped in my chest with the intensity of what he was doing to me, the heat building to every nerve in my body like a high powered lightning. That's when came. The warm pulsating wave of my orgasm came, and my whole body was racked with tremors and tremors, every nerve was firing off to the deepest sexual fantasy of mine. He kept pumping into my ass with deep strong strokes, and my whole body was vibrating as all of the tension I had built up in the last few hours seemed to flow outward. I think the orgasm rolled over me like a wave, and as it came, I heard myself screaming out my passion. And it was just the beginning, and I have nothing in my life to compare it to.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>I'm sorry if this was all kind of out of character or wronged, but it's a little hard on the eyes to believe but the truth is, I had no sexual experiences outside this time, except in my time as a whore. My body knew exactly what I wanted to do to someone, and I enjoyed every moment. And if you haven't read the chapters on the first couple they'll help give you better understanding on this one, which I hope will be the end of this series.
