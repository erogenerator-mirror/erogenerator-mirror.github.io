"I didn't mean to startle you. This is our honeymoon." She gave a sly grin as she pushed her hands over her breasts, squeezing them.</p> <p>"Well, we can take your time and have an evening of fun."</p> <p>"I meant what I said. I was enjoying our time with you."</p> <p>"Then you want me to take your time." He smiled, and she pulled away.</p> <p>She started to walk toward the bed. "Not your time, mine," and she stopped, taking a step backward.</p> <p>"Your time too?"</p> <p>"Yep. There are plenty of ladies looking."</p> <p>"You sure you want me to undress?"</p> <p>I smiled and nodded.</p> <p>She pulled up the covers, and then crossed to her bed, sitting on the edge. "Come on," she said, and stood up to do so a bit closer, facing me, pulling her shirt over her head. Slowly, almost teasingly, she removed her bra. She looked back at me over her shoulder. "You could get away with a lot worse."</p> <p>I shrugged. "I don't think you'd want those."</p> <p>She chuckled. "Just a little nicer."</p> <p>I leaned forward and slowly unbuttoned my shorts, stepping out of them. As soon as my shorts were pooled around my ankles, I started to take them off. Toni stopped me with a simple tug, and after I kicked them under the bed, she stood up, and started to undo her own top.</p> <p>"Don't do that."</p> <p>"I wouldn't want you to be ashamed." As before, she quickly pulled her shirt off, revealing a dark pink lace bra. She stopped to take in what was coming next, and when she looked up, she asked the obvious question. "Is my shirt real?"</p> <p>I nodded. "Yes."</p> <p>"Is this what you want, or should I go back to undressing?"</p> <p>I shrugged again.</p> <p>"Then we'll undress you."</p> <p>I looked her in the face, knowing that the truth about this was about to become obvious. "I just thought that you'd like this."</p> <p>"And I'll like my time with you better."</p> <p>"Then we'll both have better sex."</p> <p>Toni nodded, and I sat down on the edge of her bed. She stood up, and slid her underwear off, standing to the side, so my view of her body was focused again on her. She let her bra drop to the floor, and then reached down to undo her pants, before she stepped out of them. I stared, mesmerized by her bare skin, and I thought this was something I should have done only a little while ago, but today, well, I wanted more.</p> <p>She kicked her pants off, so my view of her pussy was blocked from me by the bed. She sat down on the edge of her bed, and began pulling her shirt over her head. When she had it, she sat back, but I couldn't be sure of when we'd been undressed. When she turned to face away from me again, I could see the shape of her hips, then the curve of her ass. I was lost, staring at her pussy, but I couldn't focus on it.</p> <p>She sat back down and said, "That feels amazing, doesn't it?"</p> <p>I nodded. "Very, very much."</p> <p>"I'm glad you like it that way. I could try a lot like this," she said as she turned to face me again. "Is this your one experience I've been looking for?"</p> <p>I was about to reply when she said, "It's yours to have." Before I could answer a question came unbidden from her mouth. "You know I could stay here."</p> <p>I nodded. "Of course." I leaned forward, and gently, but purposefully, pulled my shorts off to reveal a bulging cock.</p> <p>Toni grinned, and slowly leaned back, her arms straight, with her full breasts pushed up. I smiled, and began to remove my shorts. I watched as she unbuttoned her shirt, and dropped it and her bra onto the floor as she leaned against the headboard.</p> <p>I pulled my shorts down, leaving me naked from the waist down as she leaned against the headboard, fully clothed. She turned toward me, with a sexy smile on her face. "Do you want to fuck my breasts?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes," I answered.</p> <p>She smiled back, and stood to kiss me. She pulled away, and we kissed deeply, for a minute. "I want you," she whispered quietly to me before we ended the kiss. "I want you so much."</p> <p>I nodded.
