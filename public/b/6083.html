I saw a group of people on a picnic table. When we pulled up the driveway, I was surprised to see a group of three couples, all couples, at the far end of the picnic table with their backs to me. I felt a little embarrassed to see them there, knowing that I had not even gone that far to get here dressed, when my wife, Beth, and her best friend, Tracy were already seated at the picnic table having sex.</p> <p>Once I pulled in to the driveway, and went straight to a bathroom to put on my clothes, Beth was already waiting at the door to the table. We took our seats, and just stared as the three new friends, Tracy, and Carol all entered the living room.</p> <p>I looked around, and then said, "This isn't very cool. These three are going to love going with this."</p> <p>"Yeah...maybe another two months, and they're going to be our only on-line entertainment. Beth, can you be a doll, please?"</p> <p>"Oh, you know I can. I've been talking online with a few of Beth's friends, getting the names of all the people we know, and getting the names of their sex partners as well."</p> <p>"Well, the one who asked the question, and got a 'hottie' is going to love this."</p> <p>Beth started to laugh, and then said "Come on, it's only for three weeks, we'll get a week-end off to enjoy the fun."</p> <p>"Oh, I bet we will be able to do it, you know, with Beth, but we really need to wait to see what she is doing with you and Tracy. We've got a very exclusive club here, and they are already giving you your own room to use. That would be awesome if it didn't go to a few horny people for the next month!"</p> <p>Beth started to cry, and started to pull her hair back, but I stood up and said, "No, no, you don't have to get up, because Beth won't mind. You'll just sit there and watch, and think about what you could be doing with these guys."</p> <p>Beth looked at me and said "Oh, so you're telling me that's our only way!"</p> <p>"I'm only telling it to you, because you'll be the only one of you that'll be with us on our own."</p> <p>"Oh my, what is it?"</p> <p>"My own personal porn collection. It has thousands of videos of you sucking my cock, fucking my ass, and me shooting my cum on your face. If you want it, we can sign it right here. I'll keep you all week for the next two months and we can put anything you want in it in any time. For this weekend, that is. We don't have to stop."</p> <p>I couldn't say anything, so I said "No. Don't do anything. But, you will do what we say. We love you."</p> <p>Tears had run down her cheeks, and she looked up at me and said "I love you more than anything. Just give me a chance. I'll have you at the party for the next month. Just forget about it."</p> <p>We all got out, and after the three of us piled into the car and drove off into the countryside, I walked around a mile looking for any signs of any other cars, or bikes. When I thought I had seen a good distance between where we parked on the top of the hill, I looked over at the old road I had been on just twenty minutes ago, and saw a nice flat expanse of snow.</p> <p>I thought it was a good idea to pull into the long narrow driveway, so I had to make sure I didn't see anything unusual. I pulled to a stop about two miles from where I parked, when a big old pickup truck pulled in and rolled to a stop beside me. The truck door flew open, and I could see the four of them, all smiling at me. After a moment, I saw Tom, Mike, and Tracy standing over me pulling out two suitcases. I was so excited about being here with all of them, all alone, that I almost cried.</p> <p>When they saw the truck come to a stop at the foot of the mountain, the lights were turned off, and they drove off, leaving me with just my shorts on. Tracy spoke up first. "You look fantastic, baby." The women all laughed. "Come on, take our bags back to the room. We can leave some of your clothes on there. I think we'll want you here in an hour, while we drive."</p> <p>I thought I heard a chuckle, but then stopped.
