She leaned forward and kissed me. I had to taste her too, and after I brought her to orgasm with my tongue, she reached behind her and unhooked her bra, pulling it off her shoulders as she moved back. She lay back again, and I slid my fingers down her belly to circle her clit. I could feel the wetness on her. I stroked her a bit, and then went down to her knees. With my mouth on her, I slipped the panties off her perfectly rounded hips, and down her legs. I knelt there, looking up at her, kissing my way down her thighs and knees till my face was level to her open, panty. I kissed her thighs, her navel, and finally, the outer lips, and began to kiss her. I took the outer lips into my mouth and licked them, pulling on them with my teeth as my tongue delved into their depths. As I licked her, at first gently, teasingly, my fingers would brush against her clit, and she stiffened for a second before relaxing and taking a deep breath and closing her eyes and giving herself to me.</p> <p>I continued there for a few minutes, kissing, touching, probing. Then I slid my tongue between it and her lips, moving to the center, fluttering my tongue as my fingers slowly opened her to me. Once I could find the wetness, I slipped my tongue inside her, feeling her body begin, and begin to move, she moved, so I was there, with her and all that existed. She moved her hips in a circular motion, moving her channel into mine, until I felt her tense. I felt her relax, and slip away, before again starting to move up and down in a slow rhythmic motion. Our tongues and tongues intertwined and moved together. We continued to kiss, slowly, as my mouth, face and hands worked their magic, feeling her rise and fall with each caress.</p> <p>As I felt her move from the last plateau, I reached my hand up and lightly caressed her clit, as my tongue caressed her. I slid my entire mouth inside as far as I could, exploring every nook and cranny of her. She tensed for a second, but it was so long, and the pressure was as wonderful as ever. She began to move again.</p> <p>"Yes, that feels great," she said, as she came to a peak.</p> <p>Her back arched, her upper body thrashed, and then began to relax. But I felt her relax in an instant as she turned her body so that she could kiss me again, a long and slow, lingering embrace, a passionate long kiss.</p> <p>I felt her arms slip around me, and as I did so, she moved her hips around mine and against mine, just as her climax began to subside.</p> <p>I could no longer keep my tongue inside her, nor could I keep my fingers on her clit.</p> <p>"Oh, God, I need to cum, do me," she pleaded.</p> <p>I could feel her relax again as she moved against me, but I knew that her breathing must be more labored than it was. Perhaps I'd better continue the kiss.</p> <p>I reached for a condom and slid between her lips. I rolled the condom against her as my cock started to move inside her, rubbing the head against the walls of her channel, and then sliding up to where we met and then back down to her clit and back along the top of my cock. She didn't seem to mind. She was moving back to meet me, and the way I was sliding into her was exciting me to a point that I think I might have gone mad.</p> <p>"God, I need to cum. Please, please, please, please, do it soon."</p> <p>I slid from her and rolled over. As I did, I reached down and slid the condom off my cock so that I could slide it off and onto the bed. I turned and began the next chapter in the story.</p> <p>I was in total control and when I reached out and touched my wife's lips, she responded. She opened her mouth and I slid the cock inside until the crown was just inside. Now my wife's mouth was open, and my cock was in her mouth. She closed her eyes and moaned as she opened her mouth, and I slid myself inside her. She was still so lubricated, but it took me a dozen strokes or so to work myself out of her mouth, letting her catch her breath.</p> <p>"I just wanted to say, if you want, we can do anything you want to do, or do theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
