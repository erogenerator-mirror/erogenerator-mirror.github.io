The bartender was a beautiful-looking blonde bartender, who looked to be a few years older than I, tall and thin, with nice legs and a firm ass, the type that the men in the bar loved. She was wearing a red dress that, like mine, was not long enough to cover her butt. Just short enough to leave little to the imagination, as she had an enormous set of tits.</p> <p>"This is my treat, my treat here. I have been looking around for this night for the last month. I haven't had a drink and I don't have a date at the moment. "</p> <p>We chatted for a little while and got to know each other. About the usual, "Would you like to have another drink or would you like to come back to my place and we can talk while I finish up for an hour or so." I found that out quickly. She and I were just like old friends but this woman was different. She had a way that was almost hypnotizing, and yet very sexy at the same time.</p> <p>Just as I suspected, she had a drink or two with me. As we talked I could feel the tension in her, but knew that she had other thoughts just as I do. She was telling me a story about her two previous girlfriends who had, in fact, fooled around with each other and even shared a bed with her sister. Her sister had been into swinging.</p> <p>When we got back to the table, she stood up to go, "If you don't mind, I would love one of your regular drinks, the one a few months ago. My treat, if you can keep them and it won't cost me a penny more." She was about to leave when she turned to me, looking as sexy as she had earlier. Her eyes were sparkling, and she walked towards me. I leaned back against the bar as she approached, and she leaned over to give me a kiss on the cheek, cheek and forehead, then headed back towards the table. At her front she was swaying her hips as if she was dancing. And it did nothing to hide her beautiful face, and it gave me the chance to watch her perfect ass sway as she walked. When she stood up again, I looked her over. She was dressed in a tight, low-cut dress that showed off all of her, but showed off the most of her tits, just a hint of a camel toe under which her red dress was clinging to her body, and it showed most of her beautiful thighs. It was obvious that this was the night as it was apparent that she was wearing stockings that ended just below her hem, garters and high-heeled pumps, her legs crossed in the air.</p> <p>When I was about to ask her about the last few days, she leaned over to me and gave me a long, lingering kiss before leaving, "And if you need me at that moment, I have room for a drink, and so does your treat."</p> <p>"Wow," I breathed. "I've never been this horny before, and this is definitely the night."</p> <p>When she got back to the bar, I ordered her round and ordered a glass of wine. She ordered another and we sat around talking and drinking, a little light conversation and mostly silence.</p> <p>It was a while until we were finished and I was beginning to feel light headed, and her margarita was running in my gut. When we returned to my place and went to the bedroom, I was wondering just how I'd managed to stay so horny, since she'd just had a couple glasses of wine. Maybe that was why she came back to my place so late. I just had to think of ways to explain to the whole world that she'd just been with another guy while I was drunk and, just to be completely certain, she'd wanted to fuck him all night. That was probably a bad thing.</p> <p>When I came home and put the wine and glasses on the night stand, I couldn't help but think how lucky I was to have her. After all, her sister was not the only woman I could do anything to. It wouldn't surprise me to see them together. And she certainly had no issues with this and I wanted to do it again, just as often. Maybe there was anything going on in that bedroom that I didn't know about. But what the hell, I'm sure she'd still want to have sex tonight. It felt kind of strange, but then again I was in a strange place, and it wouldn't be fair to my wife. That I wouldn't want to do anything to jeopardize a friendship we still had.</p> <p>I heard the front door of the house open around eight o'clock that evening and looked out the kitchen window to see why it hadn't beenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
