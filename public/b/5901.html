Her breasts, and stomach, were moving smoothly as they moved together, and she began to raise and settle her body.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum," He gasped. "Please don't stop."</p> <p>"You're so hard you're going to bust my ass!" she answered with a smile, and as if to prove him wrong, she began to rock on him. "And hot!" Her words cut through the haze of lust and desire that had enveloped them both earlier. "I thought we could get caught in a moment of passion."</p> <p>"Oh fuck," He hissed, and then let go. "I'm coming. I'm coming!" His body seized as he threw his head back and roared, and she felt the hot fluid of his sperm splash her insides. His cock slid out of her with a pained sound, and she felt it sliding down her leg, leaving a thick snail trail down her thigh.</p> <p>"You okay?" she asked, and he looked up at her with his head tilted back.</p> <p>"Just a little sensitive there," He said, "but that's okay." He lifted her arms and wrapped them around his neck, kissing her once more as she hung her head in joy. "Can we wait a while?"</p> <p>"We can't. My car isn't registered, and I don't want to waste this." She put a reassuring hand on his chest, and he relaxed his features. "I'll be back later."</p> <p>"I'll be sure to pay for my car later," he chuckled, "but no worries. I'll be right back."</p> <p>She smiled as she heard his car door close in the hallway. "That was just one incredible orgasm," she told him, and he pulled her close and laid her on the sofa, laying beside her.</p> <p>"Are you okay?" He asked her when he caught his breath. Her eyes searched his face, and he looked at her.</p> <p>"I'm fine. I just wanted to show you that I'm never going to be alone again."</p> <p>She smiled warmly, and ran her hand softly over his face. "This was definitely your first time." She looked at him and saw the mischievous glaze that she loved. Then she leaned back to his ear, and nibbled lightly on it. "I thought you'd never know," she whispered. "I've been fantasizing about this for months."</p> <p>James leaned to her ear, and inhaled her sexy scent, and her laughter filled his head. "Hush." She gave a kiss across his forehead as she drifted off to sleep.</p> <p>"I can't believe it," he muttered beneath his breath as the tears welled in his eyes.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, my love. I'm sorry. I just haven't felt like I felt with you in ten years."</p> <p>"It's okay," he agreed, wiping his eyes.</p> <p>"My brother will be home soon," she whispered softly. "I will always worry about him, but you too, my love."</p> <p>"I love you more," he said in the darkness, and then kissed her. "And that's something I'll work on, tooâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
