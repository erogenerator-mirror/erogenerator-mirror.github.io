I said.</p> <p>"It'll get you where you need to go, you know that, right?"</p> <p>"Well, now it happens." He said. "What do you want to do about it?"</p> <p>"I have no idea. And there are those other ways."</p> <p>He looked at me. He started to say something, then looked into my eyes. I leaned in to kiss him, but he turned his eyes away.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm tired. I mean, I can tell you're hungry too, but I'm kind of hungry myself."</p> <p>I leaned in a bit. I really thought I could trust him with anything. I wanted him to know I knew what he really liked, because I knew he would be a good partner.</p> <p>He turned to me, and we kissed again. His hands fell to my sides, and he had me up against the shower wall. He kissed me, then, slowly, deeply. Then, he let go, and stepped out of the tub, still standing just close enough to me to kiss me again, but just a bit. I put my hands to his lips and let him kiss me again, a little longer, then stepped back in to the shower.</p> <p>We hugged, then, wrapped up in towels, went into the main room and sat on the couch, and sat there for a while, not really talking for a long time. Then, I pulled a card out of my bag, told him I was going out with my girl friends, and told him to meet me back here in a half an hour.</p> <p>I had to go back out, so I grabbed my other bag and we hung out outside, and told Jake that we were going to go for a walk. He took a box with a couple glasses of wine that he had put in the cooler, and we walked out, with him in the lead, and me behind it. I looked at him to see his eye lids were closed and he was smiling. I knew I liked him, because, well, because of the way he was dressed in his jeans and t-shirt, too. It was a good thing, though. He was so hot and smart and funny; it just didn't make me feel uncomfortable.</p> <p>We walked for about two blocks, and he said he was headed back home and told me to take his car, that we'd stop by his place, on his way. I drove back to my house, and he followed me back there; I had told him to wait a bit. They were the same as at home, with a little different cars in the trunk and then a truck, but these ones were just the same. He seemed a bit nervous, because he got nervous a bit, too.</p> <p>Back home, we walked in his bedroom, with me looking at his suitcase, wondering if he was going to change his mind and leave it on the bed. I pulled out the suitcases, and he looked at me again.</p> <p>"What's this all about, I can't wear these clothes."</p> <p>"So, that's why you brought me here." I said.</p> <p>"Yes. So, what else is there besides clothing that I want to see?" I asked as he stood there in the doorway.</p> <p>He looked at me, then, and said, "If you wear these things, I'll take your clothes, now and we'll forget this ever happened."</p> <p>We laughed, then I started to put them on, and he asked me how I felt, and I just said: "Well, I guess it was nice. Really nice. You're so sexy, and if it wasn't for you I would not have left you like this."</p> <p>I had to tell him how sexy he looked when I hugged him while we hugged in the car. It was hot, and felt good to press my body against him. We sat down on his bed, and looked at his new shoes. We were standing in front of him again, and I just had to try them on, because they just felt too good. I put my right foot on the carpet, and put it on the chair. Then, I leaned into him, and we kissed. I kissed him back, and got him hard again, before we stopped.</p> <p>I stood up, took off my clothes, and got out of my clothes, leaving a lot of them on the floor in a heap on the side of the bed, then sat facing him again. I put my hands down on his legs, leaned over him, and kissed him there, before running them up to kiss the side of his neck. I kissed his neck and shoulders, and then moved to the next spot: I really liked that spot below his ear. I was going to go further to kiss this, and he was going to kiss it, tooâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
