I said. "You really liked that, huh?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I kinda did. It really turned me on when he sucked on my tits. I'm not as big as you but..."</p> <p>"I'm sure it's just a natural thing." I whispered. "You are beautiful. I can hardly believe you got it as easy as us girls. It's like you're always just there."</p> <p>"Yeah, and you're right." She said, and looked at my legs and pussy, which was now shiny, wet and warm. "Do you mind if I try a little taste?"</p> <p>I said, "I'm game, but we'll have to wait till we're ready." I reached between my legs for her hand and she held it, sliding it between her lips as I watched. She pulled it slowly from my pussy, and then looked up into my eyes.</p> <p>"See...It's really smooth."</p> <p>"It always does that whenever I touch it." She said, putting the head inside her lips. She pressed it back against my folds, and then spread her middle finger along the outside of my lips. I felt it touch my most sensitive spot, and I gasped, and her finger slid into my tunnel as I was ready for her. She started to slide her finger inside me, all the way to the hilt, and then back out, and then in, pushing as deeply as she could. I arched my hips up and she followed to the hilt. She pressed her thumb down on my clit to push it in and keep it there. "It feels good, doesn't it?"</p> <p>"Yeah, it does. But it seems like I can't quite get that in me."</p> <p>"I bet. It kinda hurts."</p> <p>"Yes, it kinda hurts. And I can't seem to get all the way in." She said, glancing across at my breasts. "I think you're okay. I think I can get in."</p> <p>"Go slow for a moment, okay?"</p> <p>"I am okay?" She asked, with slight hesitation in her voice. She was clearly still feeling uncomfortable being the only person in the room for a change of clothes.</p> <p>"Yeah...maybe. You did that a lot today. I just really liked how it looked." She laughed.</p> <p>"I was afraid of what people would think." She said, and then, as quickly as she had come, she began to move her finger in and out of my pussy, slowly at first, and then faster.</p> <p>I looked up at the woman, and then saw someone watching me, smiling, obviously enjoying our new situation. She was looking down at her finger now, slowly moving it in and out, and I was loving it. I closed my eyes, and could feel her finger slowly rubbing my g-spot. I was getting close to that special orgasm I've been trying not to think of for months. She pushed two fingers past my lips and into my mouth, and began stroking my clit with them with her other hand. "Mmmmmm", she said. "That's it, that's it. You okay. Don't bite it. You're doing just fine." But just before I started to come, she withdrew her fingers, and I couldn't make a third one. She was still playing with me, but she didn't seem to care. Her eyes were closed and she was obviously thinking about something. "Mmmm...Mmmm..." I moaned. As I came, she came with me, her tongue in my mouth.</p> <p>She lay there, panting, her legs open and legs open, and as I reached down to fondle her breasts, she said, "It's nice to be getting some attention. I should thank you." She gave me a quick kiss, and then pulled from my pussy as if it were a snake. I was still standing, and it was still wet from my orgasm, so I turned to help her.</p> <p>I leaned over and kissed her as I helped her get off her feet and out of the office chair. I kissed her as I did it, and we were both giggling and laughing before getting her on her feet and pushing her back into the closet. I held her against the closet door until she looked at me, and then I turned back to her and leaned down and started to kiss her again on the lips. "Mmmmm....mmmmm". She said, as we kissed again. "It's time to take you home." Not to mention the rest of the evening. After she got out of the closet, while I was taking care of the rest of the girls, my roommate and I went back to our room and took another long shower before we finally got dressed in our clothes and headed out to the carâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
