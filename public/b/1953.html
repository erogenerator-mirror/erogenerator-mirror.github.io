I croaked, not meaning to give her the satisfaction of hearing my voice, but it seemed to be all that I wanted to say in a moment. It was a very sweet sound; and if I had to stop right now, even if it felt more like a sob, I could never forgive myself for it.</p> <p>"That's good to know." She whispered again. "I'm glad we've got you home safe." She added, then leaned over and kissed my neck. I felt so safe, so protected. I couldn't help the way the feeling spread through me. The more I felt about the world, the more I realized it would never be this way again.</p> <p>"I love you..." She whispered again, holding the phone away from my hands. She held the back of my hand until it was only a fraction against the light switch. Then she turned and gently pressed the button to turn on the bathroom light.</p> <p>All I felt was a light burning, and I felt the sensation of her kisses and the sensation of her strength. She was wearing the same clothes she'd left on the bed, but nothing else was beneath. I tried not to imagine her in the water.</p> <p>"How's everything?" She asked when the bathroom light came on.</p> <p>"You?" I said with some confusion.</p> <p>She gave me a quizzical look. I knew the answer, but I couldn't seem to articulate it. It took me a long time before I could even begin to fathom how I felt. I didn't know if this was because of what we were doing, or if it was all the love we really felt, or if I even knew what I'd felt as I entered in the tub with my new body inside the warm water.</p> <p>"I'm fine." I said, my body feeling relaxed and ready to be carried away. I took the soap off my hands and used the suds to scrub her clean. I soaped the inside of her legs and washed the suds away again, getting a little more sudsy for the first time, before washing her legs.</p> <p>"I do feel dirty." I admitted. "I just washed you."</p> <p>"Well it was worth it."</p> <p>"But we haven't even started with me."</p> <p>"We haven't even started?" She asked with a curious look, looking up suddenly, and I looked down to her body again, watching for the faintest trace of a frown on either of her face.</p> <p>"I can't believe you have me back." I said.</p> <p>"I'm just worried you will think I'm some kind of pervert."</p> <p>"My dear!" She said, turning toward me and giving me a long, sweet kiss on the lips. "I have wanted you for so long, and it was all I could think of."</p> <p>"Then I hope everything works out in the end somehow." She said, a smile forming on her face. "What do you think? Do you like how I dress?"</p> <p>"Of course I love how you dress." I told her honestly. "It suits you." I added.</p> <p>"Well then, lets just skip the underwear part and see if we can find a way forward." She said as she turned away and moved her arms to the bathroom doorway and began to dry herself. I could see that she was naked, and I could see again the softness and feel of her skin.</p> <p>When she was done she stood up and reached to pick up the towel. I had never noticed her body before, and now I saw her completely naked. The difference was evident. Her skin was soft and smooth, and every muscle in her body was rigid and tight. She looked so sexy, and it was all I could think about. It brought a smile to my face, and it made my heart beat even harder as I pictured having her in my arms instead.</p> <p>I watched as she turned back toward me as she wiped her eyes and face. There was a look of contentment in her eyes. She looked incredibly good, and I couldn't stand a minute longer. It was so strange, I felt like an idiot.</p> <p>"I have to go." She said as she stepped toward me still drying herself. "Do you mind if I take you in?"</p> <p>"No, go ahead." I said, trying to regain my composure again and putting the bathroom door almost shut again. It felt like an enormous weight had been lifted from my shoulders, and my heart was pounding furiously against my ribs and felt like it was going to explode out of my chest.</p> <p>"I was wondering where you were going." She asked just as the door opened again. She was looking at me, her eyes wide, but it was the smile that told meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
