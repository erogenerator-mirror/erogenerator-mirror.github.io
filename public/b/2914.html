I asked her. "You came back after your first day. What was that?"</p> <p>"I saw some of my friends. I think that they were friends of another brother."</p> <p>"Were they? Were they what?"</p> <p>"Yes, and they are all of us."</p> <p>"You saw me naked once, were you nude?" Amy asked curiously. "Did you see me with my hair wet? Were you naked?"</p> <p>"No, we were too busy talking for each other to notice." I said with a grin, and she blushed and giggled. She was the sweetest little thing I had ever laid eyes on, and I felt her legs spread wide apart as mine spread along hers to either side. I put my right hand over hers to hold her hand to the headboard, giving my lover more leverage to continue her conversation. I was pleased that I could help my sister keep our activities in line with what we were about to do.</p> <p>"What about you, did you see me there with another man?"</p> <p>"Uh, yes, I saw you."</p> <p>"And?"</p> <p>"And what?" Her hand had returned to my shoulder like a warm blanket, holding my hand to my chest.</p> <p>"What about you?"</p> <p>I felt her hand come up my arm as she spoke, and I felt her fingers touch my neck, leaving a trail of goosebumps that I was unable to suppress. I felt that my sister's right breast might pass right along her breast as well as mine, and I thought about how nice it would be if she felt my bare chest. It was such an exciting sensation to think about, and now I couldn't have had any better thoughts. I wanted to feel the smooth skin of her bare skin, and I wanted her to feel my own bare chest.</p> <p>"Are you really sure?" she asked. "That you were there in the shower?"</p> <p>"Yes, I saw you in the shower."</p> <p>"Oh." Amy said, but she was definitely trying to hide what was bothering her. "I didn't even notice!"</p> <p>"I'm not sure. It was something I wanted to do, but didn't want to admit."</p> <p>"It was just to do something for you, to let you know how much I liked the place you were at. It was just to give you something to think of me when you think you are alone and don't worry about it. We never talked about anything like that before."</p> <p>"Yes, we had that conversation." I said with a grin. "You're the first woman that I've ever been with. That's nice."</p> <p>As she had left, I went to my room and turned on the shower before I finished my shower and got out and dried off. For an older sister like me she still had the softness of youth. I hadn't really thought about it before, but now that I was, I was hoping to be able to do that again. In truth, I wanted to see her in the shower. This wasn't about one naked girl in front of me while holding my shower door open. It was about the most intimate thing I could ever imagine having to do to someone other than myself.</p> <p>I started to leave the bathroom when I heard the shower curtain slide back. I looked down, and smiled at the reflection of my naked body under the water. I had to have my sister again. I closed the door carefully, not wanting to think about what I had just done with the other woman I loved more than anything in my life. I slipped out the bathrobe I kept on the bathroom floor, and went to join my sister in the shower.</p> <p>In a flash, my sister had me wrapped around her like a blanket, and she was moaning as the hot water hit our skin. I had to kiss her neck to get her attention, and I took her breast in my hand and brought that to my other hand, feeling that hard nipple slide through the surface of the soap. Her breath caught at the sight, and I could feel her lips opening wider as my caressing fingertips rolled that long nipple between them. She kissed my shoulder and said,</p> <p>"That feels so good."</p> <p>"Me too." I replied, knowing that she liked it just hearing that.</p> <p>We kissed for a long while, enjoying each other's mouth for a moment before our eyes returned to the other. She said,</p> <p>"Oh!" with a smile.</p> <p>She grabbed the tub ledge, lifted the shower head out of the water, and sat up.</p> <p>"I need to wash." She said after a while.</p> <p>I had only started washing when I felt the hand behind me again.
