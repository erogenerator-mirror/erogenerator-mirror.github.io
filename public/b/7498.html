She replied. "But when you want some time with your beautiful woman...don't you have a girlfriend to ask?" he added with a little more of his confidence. She let out another of those girly, girly, girly girlish girlish giggle and was ready to burst through the door.</p> <p>"No, no man!" She was the first word she managed to say as she took them off and rushed down to the guest bedroom, leaving him to make her wait while they undressed. She was in tears again and he was just going to do whatever she had to do in such a short time.</p> <p>He took her into the dark bedroom she had kept open for him so far, where she had turned around to face him and was now naked as ever. He laid her down on her back and had her put her legs up and spread, exposing her pussy before he went to move closer. He started from the top off and moved his fingers up to her mound. She was still wet as he started to play all over it. He ran a finger over her lips and made her moan. He spread her lips and moved his face into her clit, kissing and sucking it until she was bucking and moaning again.</p> <p>He moved in to start again and she was now going wild with passion as he went back and forth from one side of her clitoris to the other and back again. He then put his finger in her pussy and she sucked on it all the way as she did to him. He removed his finger to start again and she started humping against it, pulling her legs up to her chest so he could go deeper. She came immediately from his finger in her pussy and pushed against him, and then came when he did again. She felt that her orgasm was getting strong and so was the flood in her pussy. When she had finished she collapsed next to his body on the bed as his cock was still in her. It was a long and pleasurable ride, they were both content right now. Finally he got up and began to undress.</p> <p>"Let me take your clothes off, honey." She said.</p> <p>He said nothing once he was naked for a good ten minutes before finally standing and getting out of bed. She watched with him as he walked over to her and undid his belt. He dropped his pants one set at a time, dropping them to the carpet. He climbed back on the bed where he was at the edge, holding himself up with both his hands. She got on the bed to sit next to him and was once again amazed by the size and size of his dick; it was at least seven inches and very thick. She leaned forward and started kissing him, licking his lips and sucking on them to get them good and licked all around his face. She ran her tongue around his lips, taking in an extra bit or so every now and then.</p> <p>"I have never really done anything with a guy before. But now I'm really curious. And I know you have to do this to keep me safe." She said.</p> <p>Her mouth moved down his muscular chest and belly until she got her mouth to the head of his dick. She loved the feeling of the heat and the silken feel of his cock in her mouth. She was getting a taste of him now and wanted more. She looked at his face and could see that he was smiling as she worked on him. She reached out and grabbed his balls and started to play with them, she took them in her hands and started to rub them. He was doing the same to her and she loved it.</p> <p>He moved his hands down his body and held onto the backs of her hands and started to finger her. She was ready to get things started now, and she pushed his hand away. She wanted to give him the blowjob he had just given her as she played with his balls. He put his hand on her head and pushed it against his dick. She held onto it with her mouth and looked up at him, "Please, don't pull out, I can't take it if you pull out."</p> <p>He looked at her and he could see what she was thinking about getting off to. Then he had an idea. He reached down and grabbed his dick again and began to play with it like a rubber. She let it go and looked up at him with those pleading eyes, "Don't pull out, I want it inside me" he said with a smile. And she did.</p> <p>He got back up on the bed on his hands and knees and then went between her legs and pushed it into her pussy, she was still wet and ready for all he had. He fucked her for a while until she had cum again and then he made her turn over so he could be on top. They started fucking again and she still had her eyes closed when she feltâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
