But now that she thought of it, she couldn't blame her friend for not seeing it in her eyes.</p> <p>"I'm still sorry. I don't know how to explain it. I'm just glad that the man doesn't mind, and so I can't seem to remember when I'm not naked or feeling all self-conscious."</p> <p>"There's nothing that I can do about it. I think the problem comes from you."</p> <p>"Yeah, sure, that's why it's so rare that you're naked. That's why you don't seem so bothered about me getting to see you naked."</p> <p>"But why did you get so concerned about me being naked? I'm sure the sight of me might have embarrassed and embarrassed you.</p> <p>"There's no such thing as embarrassment around you. I'll tell you."</p> <p>"It's nothing that I care about. I was sure that I'd get another look in, but there's no way that I'm going to, with you showing me what you're hiding."</p> <p>"You really want me to...?"</p> <p>"God, yes, and do it."</p> <p>He felt very strange being that close to her but he was also terribly nervous, having this woman beside him. Of course, he felt a pang of guilt at having her see him naked and feel so turned on by it. It had to be one of the reasons that he'd been acting this way. He was getting way too close to her.</p> <p>There was only one way that he could describe that feeling, which was just how he felt. So as he got closer and closer, there was no avoiding it. The feeling in his cock made him want to see her looking at him, and if he took the same route as her he'd probably have to put himself in to get to her before he felt too close to her. It made him feel excited and nervous, and somehow he'd just have to come here and feel what he felt for her.</p> <p>He looked at her as she sat on the beach and saw the woman's hands covering her eyes. He thought of her lying naked upon the beach, the sun beating upon the delicate porcelain skin as her hair spread around her face. But in his mind's eye he saw her bare breasts hanging down upon the beach, her legs spread wide, and her head tilting back as she stared up to the stars. What he'd seen was what he hoped was her pussy, now only just beginning to form.</p> <p>He turned his head back towards her and smiled at the sight of her spread open and now only her fingers glistening in the moonlight.</p> <p>He wanted to see her with no clothes on.</p> <p>"Why aren't you?"</p> <p>"They're out. I should get back before my friend gets home."</p> <p>"Don't be silly. There's no time to be lost here, he said walking towards her. "It's dark in here tonight. Let's get back to our room and just relax."</p> <p>"No, don't go, it's late. You can stay here. We're the only people here. We're alone."</p> <p>"You're right, we're the only ones here. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be... but you're beautiful, and you're so open and you can't help the way that you look. I'm sorry."</p> <p>There was no way to describe the way that he felt about her in that moment. He hadn't felt this way for quite a while, and when he looked up into her eyes as there was only her, he could see no guilt or regret. It gave him the excuse to want her. To feel her close to him and in his arms. It gave him such feelings of caring for her.</p> <p>It was then that he noticed a flash in her eyes as she suddenly turned her head away from him.</p> <p>"Oops!" he thought to himself. "You seem a little flushed! Should I be worried? Just for this moment I'm afraid."</p> <p>Then he saw the woman's breasts as she slowly turned until they were pointed at him. He imagined that they might be her breasts, although he didn't know what they looked like.</p> <p>"I'm sorry for being... too forward. I don't know why you did it, even if you do. I just had a little problem, and I would just have let it slip and it would never have been that far away." He tried to make up for it. "You were looking at me like a fish to have come swimming to freedom in your eyes."</p> <p>He watched as she slowly slid her arms away from her breasts and turned her face away from him. But when her eyes fell upon him, and she saw himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
