"I'm pretty open about it. Sometimes it gets pretty hot." I laughed.</p> <p>"Then I'll let you in on a little secret," she replied, "I've been having some boyfriends. They just can't get enough. My problem isn't the sex. It's the money. And, most of all, that's why I live alone. I like sex all the time. The only question I've asked is, have you ever had someone watch you do it?"</p> <p>"Yes," I replied. "I would like to try it with you."</p> <p>"So when?" she asked. "Let's get started, shall we?"</p> <p>"I was wondering if you thought we might be interested in having sex?" I asked.</p> <p>She laughed and kissed me. "Oh, you could say that," she said softly. In a low voice she added. "Are you?" I nodded.</p> <p>She ran her hand down the front of my pants and into the middle of my thigh just before I felt her warm breath. For a brief moment I wondered if she could smell me, just an instant before her hot lips were between my knees.</p> <p>Then my wife's lips were on my thighs and her tongue was deep inside of me.</p> <p>"Oh that's nice," I breathed.</p> <p>"And it tastes really good, doesn't it?" my wife responded, sliding a condom on and slowly slipping off of the strap over her shoulder. She straddled my legs as she finished strapping the condom around the girth of my cock.</p> <p>She had been the one to take it off. Now, I had to feel her soft, smooth skin against the girth of my cock. It felt so right, so forbidden...</p> <p>I felt her kiss the head of my cock and then she engulfed it in her mouth. Her tongue danced in circles around my shaft as I felt the warmth of her mouth. She lifted of and then went back down, sucking hard on my balls, her lips forming an O. It was wonderful.</p> <p>My wife was kneeling on the floor before me as she held my cock. I had her back on the ground and she was sucking me hard. I felt so strong.</p> <p>"Let's do it," my wife whispered in between sucking.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum," I moaned, pulling my cock out of her mouth. "Let's do it," I added, pointing to my cock.</p> <p>"Mmm," my wife said, taking me into her hand. She rubbed the tip of my cock against the wet outer lips of her pussy. I could feel the heat radiating from within her.</p> <p>I pulled my cock away and aimed it at my wife's open mouth. With one hand I held her head and my hips thrust forward. I felt a gush of heat and wetness, then a rush of warmth and pressure that was almost too much.</p> <p>"Yes!" I moaned, almost losing my rhythm. "I'm cumming, I'm cumming," I cried out. My whole body began to shudder as I shot my load. My wife had been kneeling in the doorway listening to me cum and smiled broadly; as though she had caught just at the moment.</p> <p>She licked me clean, which felt wonderful. I watched her from the corner of my eye as she smiled and then got up.</p> <p>Then the realization hit me.</p> <p>My wife was going to be watching me cum. I was going to be naked in front of her. There was going to be no turning back. Then a thought hit me. "Why doesn't he just fuck me?" I asked myself.</p> <p>I'd been trying to think of a clever solution to the situation. As it turned out, having fucked my own wife, I knew I could think of nothing else. All I had to do was to get up and leave for the bedroom.</p> <p>I didn't think I would ever take another job here. But, here I was, alone for the first time in years. And, I had just shot my load in my wife's mouth. Then it dawned on me that if I just started it was over. Would I have to start now or did I want to work the job after the event?</p> <p>That really wasn't going to be necessary. I just needed to see what else I could do there.</p> <p>I got up and went to the bathroom. I was a smallish man and didn't like taking on a full body. I took a shower.
