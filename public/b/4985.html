Jannie asked.</p> <p>"Because your father died with the disease, so you wanted to make sure that you were safe in his arms."</p> <p>Maddy leaned in for a long kiss, then she said, "I need to do the same, as I'm a little worried."</p> <p>"What's the big problem?"</p> <p>"Because Dad wanted to get a piece of you."</p> <p>"Oh," Jannie said, thinking of the time and how hard it had been.</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>Tears were forming in Jannie's eyes. She felt that she was leaving her father and her love to be a part of this. But, it would only hurt. "Why don't we try this, Maddy? You know it isn't going to hurt you."</p> <p>"I want to try," Maddy said, "I guess then...I need you, Maddy."</p> <p>Maddy got out of bed and sat on the side of the bed. "Just lie back and relax," she said, "That way, there will be nobody else, it's just us."</p> <p>Maddy put her hands on her stomach, and her fingers rubbed her pussy a little longer as she listened to Jannie cry out. She didn't want to do that to either of them, this was too painful. Maddy rubbed her body slowly, she wanted to make it last. It didn't sound right, Jannie cried out, but she wasn't really sure. Maddy pushed her fingers gently between her lips and began rubbing her clit. All of a sudden, her body jerked, and she cried out again.</p> <p>Maddy's face turned red. "Did that feel good?" she asked. Jannie nodded, and she looked up.</p> <p>Jannie wiped a tear from her eye, "You feel good," she said. She touched her lips, and she could feel her juices soaking the skin. "You're so sexy," she whispered, "that makes me so hot."</p> <p>"It's all yours," Maddy said with a wink.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Jannie woke to the sound of a door on the front porch. After her head hit her pillow, she rolled over and tried to figure out where on the bed she was sleeping. When her memory ran a hand through her hair, she realized it was in Jannie's lap. She got up and stumbled out into the main room. "Honey, what is it?" Maddy asked.</p> <p>"It's my father and I," Jannie said.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"It's Maddy."</p> <p>"What in the hell's your problem?"</p> <p>"It's a big surprise, so I'll be down." She hurried to go find a dress or something, and when she came back, Jannie was naked.</p> <p>"You're not?"</p> <p>"No, not really, just to give me a chance. I don't think it'll be a problem. Are you dressed?"</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>Jannie got dressed, but left Jannie's gown in the bedroom. Then, she went back to the main room to find Maddy sitting on the sofa. They talked for a minute and looked at each other.</p> <p>"You ready to come?"</p> <p>"Y-y-yeah," Maddy said, wondering where her father was.</p> <p>'I'm so glad you had time to come home. I can see you having a good time already.' Jannie sat on the sofa on Jannie's legs, and leaned in close to kiss the younger girl on her lips. A little jolt ran down from her stomach and through her body like a jolt from an electric shock.</p> <p>'This is really going to happen,' Maddy thought, 'it will probably be a lot of fun. I hope it doesn't be so bad. I really really, really hope it's not.'</p> <p>When their lips stopped, Maddy said, "I should go, you're leaving.'</p> <p>'I'll find a dress, I really think I need it.'</p> <p>'I'm so sorry, I don't think I can wait that long.'</p> <p>Jannie put her hands in the back of Jannie's head and pulled her closer. 'You should be. Here, let's get you out of your clothes.'</p> <p>"You can't," Maddy said. She put her arms around Jannie's shoulders and pulled both of the girls closer. "What are you doing?"</p> <p>Maddy put her head on Jannie's right shoulderâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
