You're so hot!" he said then said with a low growl, "Oh fuck, don't stop. That feels so good."</p> <p>I could feel the hardness of his cock pressed against my stomach.</p> <p>"Oh fuck, this is so good" he managed to say between grunting breaths.</p> <p>I lifted my hand now and gripped his cock, still pressed against my stomach. I pulled him hard toward me and he felt it. He growled and pushed back against me. I didn't give up. He was all I could do and pushed harder.</p> <p>His cock was hot, hard and throbbing with every thrust he made onto me. It looked bigger as it was inside me. I had my own hand over his crotch and held it still as it slammed into me. My own hips lifted into his, my muscles clamped down on the hot shaft buried deep within.</p> <p>He was coming in me. I felt him tighten in my pussy. That set me off. I felt my legs tremble and I dug my heels and heels into his shoulders. I could no more vocalize, nor even cry out. I felt the throbbing that set me off.</p> <p>He pressed me hard against the seat, his fingers still buried in my curls. He pressed my hand from his cock to his belly. The slickness and heat from our mutual orgasm, that incredible release, made a sticky mess on his inner thigh and mine. When we came back down we remained there for just a few moments, he against me, his chest pressed to my back.</p> <p>I think that if it hadn't been for him being in my arms, I have no idea how I would have responded to his sudden presence in my life.</p> <p>I can't tell how he'd said what he had said, but we both know exactly what he had said, and it was an honest and honest statement of intent. The fact is that I loved him. I had been faithful, unfaithful, and unfaithful. I loved him the way a man loves his wife, but the truth is that I loved the guy I was fooling around with more than I loved doing it. The truth is, I didn't love it any less.</p> <p>No, no. I loved it enough to be tempted. I love the sex, and I love what goes on in his marriage. I loved him in a deep, primal way, and I love it more every day. That he is a faithful person, as much as my parents were, and more than just friends. And I've loved him for the last two years before I went off to college to be a writer, too.</p> <p>I can't tell you how happy he'd made me when I had told him I was going to college there, he'd insisted that he could't go. I guess that he was a little worried that our marriage might go the way of our budding relationship. I think he thought it was the best way to handle the situation. He said that he would go, and he went. We were in our own little world with no one in it for me to help him with the situation, and none of that mattered now. It was okay for me to be free.</p> <p>But I'd been with him longer than a couple of women or women have with me. I had a lot to learn, I thought. I'm not a whore. I am not a hooker. I am not a cheating slut. I'm not some prostitute who likes to use.</p> <p>You see, when I say the word "fucking" I mean what you might think.</p> <p>I know the expression, I mean what would it explain my words and actions? Well, one would think that to love a man, and have a husband, that I'd be like, "I love it when a man fucks me," and not necessarily the best kind of marriage person.</p> <p>But then, that's the difference in sex, isn't it? I feel the same way. We have sex, and we fuck, and we like it, and we don't stop until our whole relationship has changed. Or it goes that ways.</p> <p>I think that when we were together, and he was there, I'd had a feeling that we were getting close, but I was careful to distance myself from that feeling with him, just in case.</p> <p>But that's not all, of course. When he fucked me, we were in our own little world. He wanted to do it that way, and wanted me to be ready and willing. He wanted me to be a good and faithful wife to him, and to be good to him, and to love him, and to treat him as though he'd known me forever.</p> <p>Sometimes what is most important is how my friend likes it, but it doesn't really matter that muchâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
