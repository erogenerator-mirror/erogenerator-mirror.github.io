I smiled nervously at her. When she smiled back her eyes were full of desire and lust. I couldn't look away. What she was offering was a special gift for me. If she could show me what I had fantasized about for so long, then I'd be all for her.</p> <p>"Take off that towel honey" I whispered before I kissed her gently on the lips.</p> <p>She nodded and looked down. "Okay. Take the rest of your clothes off. I want to see if you're a virgin."</p> <p>My mind was racing with emotions. I wanted her badly. I wasn't sure how far this would go. She'd just been the woman I loved and she was acting like she thought a guy would know. I couldn't believe how horny she was.</p> <p>"Is your cock bigger than that?"</p> <p>She nodded again. That was another of her tricks. She had to know that I was thinking these thoughts about her. My cock was as hard as iron and I was aching to feel her body. I wasn't going to lose it in the shower for an hour or two. I had been looking forward to her company for weeks. Now I knew I would do everything in my power to make this happen.</p> <p>She stood up and took her clothes off. Under the water I was relieved that I wasn't wearing any panties. "God, I love your cock." And to put it bluntly, her cock was bigger than most guys. I could tell she loved it. "Mmm, your cock feels so good in my hand honey."</p> <p>"You're so beautiful." I said, as I knelt down to kiss her cock. When I opened my lips to lick it, I had to resist the urge to reach out and grab her by the balls and hold them there.</p> <p>Instead I wrapped my hand around the base of it and began to slowly stroke it. I loved the hard little head so much it was purple. I could feel her heartbeat under my hand. I opened my mouth up and sucked in the head causing it to twitch up and down. She could tell what I wanted. I pulled off with a smirk on my face.</p> <p>"My turn to have fun baby. I have got to see what you can do with your mouth before you fuck me."</p> <p>I kissed the head. She was oozing a generous amount of precum. I used all of my tongue on the underside of it before I sucked it into my mouth and ran my tongue over it. She shuddered. I moved my lips to the shaft and gently ran my lips down it to the base. I repeated this several times.</p> <p>"You're not going to last too long honey. Get up on this side." I pointed at the end of the bed. She came to the center of the bed, where I motioned for her to put her face into the pillows. She hesitated for a second before settling down so she had to lie on her back.</p> <p>I walked over to her cock and slowly sucked it into my mouth. She was getting more and more aroused. I teased her by licking her tip. I wanted to taste it. I licked around the head teasing her. "Mmm, I've been waiting for this for so long." She moaned. "Is it good?" She nodded.</p> <p>I took her shaft into my mouth and held it in place to keep her from hurting herself. I ran my tongue up and down the underside of it a couple times and then I took it back into my mouth and took a deep breath. She tasted even better. Her cock tasted amazing. She reached down and massaged my balls for a moment.</p> <p>"You taste like chlorine babe" She said. "I couldn't get enough of you just from sucking it honey."</p> <p>I took it out of my mouth again and continued to stroke while I sucked on the head. I was hoping it would become hard again. I wanted to suck her cock as hard as I could. She wanted that too. I looked up at her and smiled.</p> <p>I licked her cock from the base to the head, up and down the underside. She tasted so good. My cock was hard as a rock and tingling from being trapped in that sweet box it was meant to be. I was wondering how far she would take this. She didn't say another word. She laid back down, with her eyes closed.</p> <p>I took her shaft into my mouth once again, this time down to the underside. I felt the head press against the back of my throat. I opened my eyes and looked down to see her looking up at me with those beautiful eyes of hers.</p> <p>"That feels good doesn't it honey?" she asked. She had pulled her knees up to her chest and had pulled her shoulders up enough to allow meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
