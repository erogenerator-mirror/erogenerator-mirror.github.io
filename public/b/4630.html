It's a good name, but I didn't realize what that was."</p> <p>"It's okay. I got a job in an advertising place and this was my job this morning. Don't worry we're doing okay, I'm not gay, just not into boys."</p> <p>"But....."</p> <p>"Don't worry, I'm a very handsome man. I know this is supposed to be the best of both worlds."</p> <p>"What's wrong with me? I don't even understand girls."</p> <p>"Well, they all have to be attractive and with that attitude of their own, but they also don't know what to do."</p> <p>"I don't know, I've been told they can do anything that feels good. Besides, I'm not gay."</p> <p>"Well, I don't think that's a good thing. You can't be gay forever."</p> <p>"But I like boys, they're kind. I like girls, they're nice, and they're cute. It's fun trying to get into these situations, just relax and go with it."</p> <p>"You're making assumptions. That's not what I meant!"</p> <p>"No, I'm just saying I like women, but there's not much I don't like about girls."</p> <p>"I'm beginning to think that there's just no reason not to explore the world. And if you have a girlfriend, she'll be pretty sure she wants to go out with you. I don't think I would try to convince you to go the night off with someone else, not if she wanted to hang out with your group of friends."</p> <p>"Do you think my group will notice I told you it's not a group anymore?"</p> <p>"Maybe. If you're serious, I'd better make sure everyone is there." We left the pub and got out, both ready to rush if we didn't have too much to drink.</p> <p>I followed her home, and I'd expected to find that she'd followed me to her house, but instead she'd stopped on her way home, but she didn't stop until we arrived in front of her place. Once again, I was surprised at the look of it, but it seemed like that look was something she needed to remind herself that she wasn't "gay" and that she didn't have to do what I had suggested. She pulled the key card from her pocket and opened the door. I followed her inside, noting her light brown hair hanging on top of her shoulders and it reminded me of the pictures she had of our trip.</p> <p>"Thanks for joining us, so this is the first time I've seen you. You're really a hottie."</p> <p>"Thanks, I'll let you know if you change your mind. Let's grab some drinks and sit down for a while. We can talk about it after we're done."</p> <p>"I guess you're right. My body hasn't even had enough time to think about anything else. Maybe we should get out of here."</p> <p>She tossed the keys on the kitchen counter, and we each grabbed a beer and headed out onto her patio. She sat on the patio and waved as we walked to the bar.</p> <p>"So, I guess you'll be joining your group soon."</p> <p>"Yeah, they've all talked about coming over for a coffee, so why don't you join us?"</p> <p>"Well, not sure yet. They asked me, I gave them the address, and so they're still here...."</p> <p>"Yeah, maybe you're right. You seem more relaxed now that you're involved with the group."</p> <p>"I guess, it was fun."</p> <p>"So, I think we're going to do some things for each other."</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess."</p> <p>"I've got a couple of ideas...."</p> <p>"Really, you mean like what? I've never had three guys at the same time at the same time, but....."</p> <p>"Yeah, right. Do you want me to make dinner or something? We're all starving so maybe we can do something, if there's a lot of food and I can help out."</p> <p>"There's a really good-looking diner in town, we can get something to eat there if you want. The manager might just like that one."</p> <p>"Sounds nice. Why don't you come with us?"</p> <p>After a short discussion, we all agreed and followed Jenny home. When we got there, she headed for the front door, saying she had to go home.</p> <p>"Oh, I was hoping I could stay a little longer."</p> <p>"You weren't supposed to come."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I had something else on my mind."</p> <p>"No, don't be sorry, just stay. I'll call you laterâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
