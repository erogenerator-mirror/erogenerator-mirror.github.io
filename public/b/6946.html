My cock slid out a little deeper and he wrapped his hand around it. I watched it, enjoying the length and breadth of his cock, the size and length.</p> <p>"Are you ready?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes," I responded, staring. I had always wanted this. I hadn't had anyone but him since I was sixteen.</p> <p>Beth looked at me for the first time. The smile was huge across her face. It was so much different than my old confidence. She didn't seem the type to give it any thought. Instead, she lifted one of her legs to rest upon my waist. It lifted my ass off the bench and onto the bar. It made it easier to move my cock in and out of that hole without any effort. I leaned forward now, giving her the opening to impale herself upon me there.</p> <p>She didn't say a word. Instead, she reached one hand back between her legs, rubbing herself with her hand while she took hold of the shaft of my cock with her other hand. Her hand slid her fingers down to her lips to moisten them then she took my tip in her mouth, sucking it while she took me out.</p> <p>She took her own hand away from her cunt, moving her fingers to rub her clitoris as she took me deep inside her mouth. A low moan escaped her lips as she sucked and caressed my cock, the muscles in her throat gripping and releasing as it came out, taking my cock as well as she could.</p> <p>I was almost about to go over the edge with the feeling of her mouth and fingers on my cock, when her hips suddenly lifted out of the bench and she let out an extended gasp as my orgasm hit the back of her throat.</p> <p>I pulled my cock out of her mouth quickly and laid it on the bench before her. Beth reached up and held my prick like she wanted to do without moving it. "Don't move," she said in a breathy voice. "I want you inside me when it starts to peak."</p> <p>She lowered herself again so that my cock was just pointing there. I looked between her legs as she lowered herself towards my hips and with an almost imperceptible motion, slid her pussy down onto my cock and back a few times then lowered herself once again. She rose back up, rubbing her clit with my cock once more and lifted me up again until I was almost free.</p> <p>She looked down, resting on my chest, her ass hovering above me. "Put your body against mine," she said and pushed herself back against my stiff shaft. I couldn't move. Beth had taken control and I was going to use her for all she was worthâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
