As she slowly pulled my cock out of her mouth, she sucked it back in once again. She went down once more, her hands now going to my ass and pulling on my cheeks. It wasn't easy as she moved faster and faster, sucking me harder and faster every time she pushed down, sucking away more and more of me down her throat. She was swallowing and sucking noisily and moaning and moaning. Just when I thought I couldn't take any more, she lifted her head, and then, "Oh, my, God, I'm going to--I'm going to--I...," and, "Gah!" followed by "Now!"</p> <p>The first time I had climaxed, from the mouth sucking and the fucking, from fucking her, I had a massive erection. She immediately pulled her mouth off of me and got out of bed. I got up and came out of the bathroom with my legs sticking out of my pants, and a huge erection. I walked over to her, put my hands on her shoulders and gently pushed her down to her knees. I wanted to use her mouth, but I decided to fuck this girl and see where the hell she went. I looked over at my hard-on, it was so obvious, and I decided to tease her a little by just running my dick up and down between her lips a few times. She smiled up at me and stuck out her tongue, moving it in an up and down motion. I watched her tongue flicking out and I heard her sucking on it. I leaned down and lifted her skirt and took off her panties.</p> <p>I put her panties in my pocket, along with her clothes. I started by sliding her skirt up her legs and around her waist. Then I started sliding her panties down her legs to her ankles. I pulled her panties off, tossing them over to her.</p> <p>I told her to take of her shirt. She did, and then she was naked. She laid back, legs open, as far as she could possibly go. She opened her arms to me, as I layed with her in the middle of the bed, in a sixty-nine position. I took a breath and dove into her pussy again. I began flicking her clitoris with my tongue and then began fucking her pussy with my tongue as fast as I could, using my whole body, just as she knew I liked to. It got me very hot to see her face in the throws of a climax. I continued licking her clitoris then slid my tongue inside of her. It only took a second or so after we climaxed into that position before she started having one huge climax. I continued licking and then she asked me to fuck her mouth again, so she could taste what she had just had. Just as she did, we heard the car doors open and close. We got up from the bed and she pulled her panties back up as I went to get dressed.</p> <p>I kissed her cheek, and she smiled, put her arms through mine and held me tight to her. "I love you," she whispered.</p> <p>I pulled my shirt on, she got out of bed, she grabbed her bra and put it on after putting her panties on. She was just as gorgeous as when we first met. I thought the only thing that mattered to her was how I was going to spend my life. I grabbed my keys, got my jacket and got my backpack out of my room. We looked at each other and then she kissed me. It was so sweet and I felt great. Even though it was a bit awkward, it felt really nice.</p> <p>I went over to my car and got in. She got in behind me and we kissed a lot, letting me feel her body, touch her skin against mine. She held my hand in hers as we kissed. I couldn't believe it was her, it was the girl I had always wanted to be with again. It was like the moment I met her, a girl never stopped talking about me. And then came that first kiss. It was like nothing I had ever felt before. Even though she'd been there and she had said I always knew she was a great kisser and I could not believe my luck. She was everything I had dreamed about.</p> <p>We didn't get home until noon the next day. I was very nervous about the day ahead. She was going to have her boyfriend at the wedding, and we weren't going to have him home until after we got back from the airport. Neither of us really talked much, except about school stuff until Friday. At the end of the day, she and I were a bit apprehensive. I wanted her to tell me all about it, since we were going to spend our wedding night with her. I wanted to tell her everything, that we were going to be parents, that we were going be lovers and she wanted toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
