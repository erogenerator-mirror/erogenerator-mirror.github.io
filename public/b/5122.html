All her pubic hair was shaved and she leaned in to give me a kiss on the lips, the same place I'd spent so much time kissing in the airport. As our lips met, I saw a little flash of panic, but it wasn't anything to see. That was one of the things about being with her.</p> <p>She took a slow step forward, sliding one hand down my body as she did. I followed, slipping the tip of my own cock through the opening, making her gasp at the heat of it. I pulled away from the kiss just a little, and she turned around, slowly, and then pressed me back against the car again. Her body moved back and forth a little so the head of my cock was sliding up and down her slit, and she pushed her body down slightly, and my cock slipped inside her.</p> <p>"Oh, yes!" she moaned, as I pushed her down again and brought her down, hard, on my cock.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," she moaned again, her hands on my shoulders and back, her feet on the sides of the car. She rocked her hips, the motion pressing her clit against my cock, as I kissed her as I pushed into her. I wanted to cum immediately, but, in order to cum, I had to keep going. So I stopped for just a second, sliding my tongue down her neck, stopping at her chest. As I did I looked into her eyes, and saw that she was concentrating entirely on the feeling.</p> <p>She pushed against my chest, and as I pulled away she moved toward me as I pushed back toward her. "Fuck me, Danny," she whispered, and as she felt the warmth of my body on hers, she turned and slid her tongue into my mouth.</p> <p>Without a word, we both slipped onto the back seat of our car, and I got out, still hard as iron and feeling the softness of her body against mine. "I'm sorry," I whispered as I put my hands back on her knees. She laughed.</p> <p>"You didn't have to. You're the one that was waiting and getting ready in there." She reached down and lifted her panties to sit on my cock where the head was still poking up through her folds. "I think I can wait a little longer." I didn't move, as she took my hand and raised it to her clit. "Do it, please," she murmured as I started sliding the head of my cock into her.</p> <p>"You are gorgeous," I told her, pulling back and thrusting in again, while I kissed her the side of her mouth. She moaned again with her mouth still on mine.</p> <p>"I want you inside me again," she whispered to me. Before I could object my cock was completely imbedded in her again, moving deeper and deeper in one stroke.</p> <p>"I'll fuck you for a long time, but you're ready for it, aren't you?" I managed to find a way to say, before I could stop my face from burning red.</p> <p>"Fuck me, Danny." I knew I was pushing the limits and I wasn't about to back down. Before I could react to even some of the language she was saying, she had lifted herself up, and was grinding down on my cock with one hand as her lips closed around my neck and she began to kiss me, hard and with purpose. She pulled my upper body into her, and as we continued to make the most of our coupling both began kissing me more deeply than ever before.</p> <p>Her hands went to my shoulder and she leaned her head back again, so I could reach around and grab her butt. I squeezed her cheeks one time, before I kissed her neck again, and then on to her mouth. She began to kiss me back, and before she realized it, we were kissing a real hot, passionate kiss! She broke away from me, and I followed in the same motion, with my cock moving in and out as her hips moved and her hands grabbed and pulled at my back.</p> <p>"I want to be on top of you," she said as she slid off my cock and put her head down again on the head of the steering wheel. She looked over at me and smiled as she looked at me. Once I was in her, she sat astride me so she could sit on me. With one hand she was teasing her fingers on her clit as she started to move her pussy up and down my cock. It felt so good as she moved her lips back and forth over mine, and I could feel the heat and wetness from herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
