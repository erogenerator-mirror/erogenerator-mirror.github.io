The light contact with my body was almost unbearable; I couldn't help to pull my hair to one side. It was a weird thing to imagine on the contrary, but not in a bad way, just a pleasant distraction. It might sound weird, but it was definitely arousing.</p> <p>I pushed my hand back, looking at it for a minute before dropping it to my side, enjoying it, before it was gone again. My body was ready to go again, now, so I pulled up another pillow, turned off the lights and laid back down, with just enough light to see the sheets, while also enjoying myself, trying to be quiet and at peace.</p> <p>Hours passed in silence. The moon was full, shining through my window, casting bright colors off the windows, but it was getting darker. The night outside would be gone soon. I wasn't tired, though, I wasn't sure. Everything was still. The whole world had faded to blackness, no doubt for the most part.</p> <p>I slept. I was dreaming. My dream girl was lying there in front of me, naked and beautiful... her body was naked, and I was naked too. She was naked and beautiful, lying here, her hands resting on her legs and hers cupping them around my head and her legs around me.</p> <p>My dream girl was kissing me... and the kissing progressed and the kisses went farther, and my dream girl started to stroke my hair, with her hand as if it was something she had no control over. The kiss changed to a full body embrace, and my fingers went to the back of her head and touched the hair behind her ears. All of her head moved in response to me, so I could see her perfectly nakedness, though the rest of her was naked. The kiss became more passionate, the kiss became aggressive, the kiss turned a shade darker. She was a beautiful girl, naked in my arms; my dream girl was my beautiful naked dream girl.</p> <p>She was my goddess, that I was never to see again. I was never to be touched. I was never to feel my body without approval in this way. I looked at the clock, and decided to stay up until it was dark. It was only the light from the windows, which would help me a lot. I was awake now. I didn't need to do anything. My dream girl made a noise, and I saw her. I was awake. Now. I was about to make love with her.</p> <p>I pulled my shirt off and went back to sleep, but realized I really couldn't be in this position for long. She was kneeling on the floor beside the bed, her legs on either side of mine, but a few inches above the bed. I felt my body begin to get wet, and I started trying not to wake. She was still asleep, and so was I. I reached out and grabbed the sheets, but as soon as I was done I felt cold, and it felt as if I had left my clothes on the floor. I pulled them to right under the bed, and then lay back.</p> <p>I couldn't imagine what was going on, where this was going, but right now I couldn't think of anything else than where I was, that my body belonged to her and me alone, alone in this room with my dream girl, naked and ready to go. I was exhausted, but there was the one thing I had, and what it was was very important to me.</p> <p>"You're not falling asleep, are you?" she asked, with a sweet smile, that had a little twinkle, like she was amused, or really a little curious. "You're getting more and more sleepy."</p> <p>"I'm not falling asleep, am I?" I asked nervously. "I'm not falling asleep on the floor like I have, just... well, lying there."</p> <p>She laughed and pushed my hair away from my neck, leaned forward and put her lips to my forehead. She rubbed her hand on my cheek, as if her body was ready to sleep all of me, but her lips were on my cheek. It was a light touch, but I felt like she could tell I was awake. I sighed. I felt her move, and then close her mouth around my left ear. Her tongue ran across the small nub, and then she slowly pulled away, leaving me feeling completely defenseless, that my dream girl was still kneeling beside me, waiting as I felt her wet and warm hands on my face. When she was done she wiped her lips on the back of her hand, and then she leaned forward and kissed me on the middle of my cheek.</p> <p>"You're my angel," she said when she was finished.
