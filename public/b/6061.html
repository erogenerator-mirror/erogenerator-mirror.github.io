You know I love you, but that's not how we have sex, right? Are you sure you're okay with all this?"</p> <p>"Don't be ridiculous, it's not like we haven't done some things that we're not proud of!" she said with a big smile. "It's just that I didn't even know about a guy's penis until I saw yours! It's about damn time we met again. I just want you to know that I'm not some woman throwing a party to find love, so stop worrying and come over and feel free!"</p> <p>"Sure, you're not a woman who wants to fuck somebody and don't have to be nervous about it. It's just that something in your past that I'm not comfortable with, it just makes me feel a little vulnerable."</p> <p>"No worries, I'm not nervous."</p> <p>We walked over to her dresser and I got a better look at her body. She was lean and fit, with a nice rack. Maybe five or six inches, with medium sized perky breasts, a small waist and an amazing ass.</p> <p>"You've got the most incredible body, Beth. I can only imagine what it's doing to you at my age!"</p> <p>"Do you like what you see?" she asked me with a sexy smile.</p> <p>"Yes, yes, I love it. The only problem is that I'm thinking of taking a shower!" I said with a mischievous grin.</p> <p>"It's not that I don't trust you. I mean it's not like we're having an affair!"</p> <p>"Do you like the way I smell? Like chlorine or something?" I asked as I pulled my tank top down to cover my chest.</p> <p>"I haven't felt that much chlorine in a long time!" she said with a broad smile.</p> <p>I slipped the tank top over my head and tossed it to the side. We looked into each other's eyes and then our mouths met. This may not be such a big deal, but I was already rock hard. Our lips pressed together. Our tongues danced in each other's mouths. As our passion grew, so did the kiss grew more passionate. I reached down her belly with my hand and cupped her breast. As I squeezed her breast, I kissed her neck and collarbone while my hand worked the buttons along the thin fabric of her blouse. As I sucked her neck gently, she moaned slightly and reached down and undid my shorts. I stood there in front of her, not wanting to say anything, just reveling in the moment.</p> <p>I pulled back and moved her blouse open, kissing her as I undid the button and slid the cloth from her shoulders. Then I pushed her hands to the hem of her skirt and pulled it down her legs, all the while kissing her passionately. She sat on my bed, her hands at her sides, looking me in the eyes. I looked down at her and we smiled, as I slipped my hands into her skirt. As I caressed and caressed her perfect thighs through her skimpy knickers, I kissed them and then gently tongued her crotch. As I teased her through her knickers, her wetness was seeping through and I knew she was enjoying it. I pushed her knickers to one side and then sucked her lips, as I worked her clit through the silk material. I flicked my tongue, swirling it across and then into her, getting a little harder. She moaned and I could hear her breathing getting heavier.</p> <p>Suddenly she rolled over, her eyes wide. "Get your pants off before you get any ideas," she whispered.</p> <p>I stepped over to my bed, turned on the lamp, and lay down. She climbed on and straddled the bed, slowly lowering her wet pussy onto my cock. As my cock hit against her mound, her pussy contracted around it, sucking it in. She moved her hips up and down, taking my cock in and out of her. I moaned. "Oh, that is so good!" she hissed. Then as I moved my hips up and down, her pussy muscles gripping my cock, she moaned, "Yes, that's it. Move around a little. Make yourself comfortable!"</p> <p>"If you don't know how to take this, it's an incredible feeling, Beth!" I whispered, as I moved my hips up to her clit. She took that as an opening, moving her hips in slow circles as I rolled the sensitive nub between my thumb and forefinger. "You are so fucking sexy, you know!" I gasped.</p> <p>She lay down and leaned back against the headboard, her face at the base of the bed. I watched her beautiful breasts bouncing as she thrust her hips back upward.
