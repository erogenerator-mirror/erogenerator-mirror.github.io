I never realized someone played music like that. I could see them, like the waves slowly rolling over them, as they moved. That had always been an incredibly erotic sight I had watched in college and now, in this light, it was an almost surreal reality. It seemed like my mind was in a whirl as my mother looked completely different!</p> <p>I couldn't take much more, but still I kept watching her playing. The moment was nearing, just so she could open each room window. I was not sure if I would find where they were, or if they had really been open until now.</p> <p>My mother was still rubbing herself while she continued to play. The two movements, she now bent over, and I saw her fingers moving between her folds, as she pushed them deeper into herself. I continued watching her and trying to hold myself in check but now that we had stopped touching, she began to move with her fingers more urgently.</p> <p>Finally I found the words, "Can I have a closer look"? She pulled her fingers from herself, and I took myself inside my pants. She was right there! It wasn't just her movements, it seemed like she even seemed to be standing, almost a floating figure, as my hand slowly made my way into her sex, and into her wetness, finding her clitoris and spreading it across the tip of my finger.</p> <p>As I touched her there, she quickly picked herself up, and threw the covers off. She had been rubbing herself with abandon, her own hand had found and covered her breasts and she was pulling her nipples as my fingers explored her, spreading her open, sliding across her lips, and finding her clitoris. My mom was so turned on, that if anyone had looked into her room they should have thought she had let the boy have her, even though he did it without her knowledge.</p> <p>The next minute I realized my hands were shaking. I could see her body shake, as she reached down once more, as I fingered her. I could feel it move, and shake uncontrollably! As she continued to play she was rocking slightly as well, and I could tell. I wanted very much to give her more, but it wouldn't be possible, as my fingers were no longer touching her and it wouldn't fit.</p> <p>I could see her in front of me, I could even see her face now, as I continued my probing. I couldn't believe what I had been watching. I didn't know what happened to her! My mind was being overwhelmed by everything, as her movements grew more intense. Her breath seemed to get stronger, and I realized in the moment, that I thought I could see her mouth open and then shut, her hips moving faster. I think she came, but I didn't know how. Was she just coming?</p> <p>I still could not find a way of telling you who she was, but that didn't stop her from playing. Her hand was in me more, now, and it wasn't like it was trying to hold me. I heard myself softly begging her to go harder and faster, even though I really couldn't.</p> <p>It seemed as though I was in pain. But there was no denying it was true, at least from my own point of view. Maybe I was in pain, but perhaps not in any of the general symptoms of the pain related to sexual excitement or to being excited. Maybe it was just the intensity of the feelings. Whatever the story may be, it was making it hard not to just fuck her, because that was what I really wanted.</p> <p>My fingers began to move faster and faster now. I could feel the walls of her opening, and the inner area of her opening. It was like I was playing with a vibrator, as I fingered her so vigorously. I could not believe I was having sex! That was so amazing! I knew I wasn't going to last any more until I did! I started to cum as well, and when it hit, I heard my own grunts like they were coming off a string!</p> <p>I stayed on top of her now as I could still feel her muscles contract as she came! Her face was red, and she was breathing hard, but it must've been quite quiet because no one seemed to notice. I continued. There was no question that I had fucked her. My mother was definitely one of 'those' people who came to their own conclusions, as I couldn't explain it, but I did that sometimes.</p> <p>Then all of a sudden she was still. I could feel her body quivering, as the last of her orgasm faded away.</p> <p>"Wow, that's the whole thing! I've never had anything even remotely like it before!!" She finally spoke after a pause. "You made it! It was awesome"</p> <p>For the second time that nightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
