She looked over her shoulder and noticed that he had his hands on her hips. She looked back and saw him rub his cock through the material of her skirt, pressing into her ass cheeks.</p> <p>"Oh god. Would you do that for me?" she whispered to him.</p> <p>"Oh yeah, I would, I would if you would turn around and let me take your blouse off, so I can suck on your tits." he said smiling back at her.</p> <p>She turned around and slowly pulled the shirt from her jeans. She turned to face him and bent over to unhook her bra. She turned back around, looking him again. She saw him taking his cock in one hand, the other was rubbing her right breast.</p> <p>"Oooo, my tits are nice and full," she said to him. She felt a tinging sensation in her loins.</p> <p>"I like hearing that," he said. Then he leaned in close and started licking her nipples with slow strokes. He felt her nipple getting harder in his mouth.</p> <p>"Oh god, yes!" she groaned.</p> <p>"Take off your blouse." he urged her. She reached behind her and unbuttoned her top. She pushed it and her bra down and off.</p> <p>"Oh baby," she gasped as he took her nipples into his mouth.</p> <p>They sat there for a moment sucking on each other's nipples before both were in bliss.</p> <p>"You like that I can suck your tits, do you. . . oh you like that, baby." He asked her.</p> <p>"I don't think they are anything special." she answered, she had enjoyed his attention to her pussy so much. It had been a week since their last rendezvous.</p> <p>"Yeah, but you like it," he continued. "This is what makes me feel so alive."</p> <p>As his hand squeezed her tit, he asked, "Would you like me to lick both of your nipples now?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes, please!" she panted.</p> <p>A minute later he had his mouth on her tits and, as they sucked and nibbled each other's nipples, he felt her hand move between their bodies and feel his cock growing hard in his pants, she was holding the front of his pants. As her nipple became erect, he took it into his mouth. Pulling back, his mouth moved to her neck, then nibbling his way down her neck, he ran his tongue over her shoulder. As his mouth neared her left tit, he sucked on it, gently tugging it with his lips, pulling on that nipple.</p> <p>"Oh that feels so good, baby," she moaned as she felt his mouth follow her left nipple, his hand was rubbing her clit and making her head roll as if from a distance. Her hand was playing with the hair around his ear. His mouth continued down her body and started to suck her other tit, as he did this.</p> <p>"Oh baby, I want to feel you cum in my mouth." she whispered to him.</p> <p>"Oh yeah, but we have to go to get to class."</p> <p>"But I just had to give it a good go and I was not ready yet." she said, "but I'll be ready soon."</p> <p>The End! -- A couple of suggestions.</p> <p>To be continuedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
