I felt her tense and tremble, then she pressed against me with all the strength of her arms, kissing and grinding against my groin. She moaned, a low, guttural wail that was both endearingly intimate and intensely sexy. Her hands slipped to unbutton my shorts, and she pulled down gently on the waistband, lifting me up.</p> <p>“Oh, God, John!” she muttered, “You’ll never guess what this is.”</p> <p>She held me, lifting me, my swollen cock and balls jostling above the soft cushion of her ass. Then she sat on my lap and leaned over, pressing me into the middle of the couch. She rubbed her belly against my cock, and I realized she had undone my shorts. When she pressed my shaft up into her abdomen, she gave me a teasing smile. “It’s a nice-looking cock you have,” she said. “I’ll have to suck it, John!”</p> <p>She rolled my erection around inside her belly. She squeezed my cock, making it jump with excitement. Then she dropped her hips slightly, and the head of my cock made its way through the silky, wet folds of her pussy lips. She felt the weight of the shaft, feeling the heat of my body against her. She sat astride my thighs and leaned back, bracing herself and resting the palms of her hands on my chest. She lifted her arms in a wide arc, and I slid one hand underneath her, between them, where I cupped a breast and rolled the erect nipple between my fingers. She let out a sigh as I gently caressed the mounds of flesh, then leaned back and raised her hips up and down, sliding the length of my shaft in and out. She looked up at me, and I saw the lust and passion there in her dark blue eyes, and I realized she was already wet.</p> <p>She took a firmer hold of my cock, stroking it as she moved to straddle me, sliding me into herself. She rose to straddle me, her lower body pressing my waist against the side of the couch. There was a level of closeness she’d never before experienced, and I thought I knew what she might experience.</p> <p>“Oh, God.” she whispered at length, “if you don’t hurry, it might go too fast. I’ll be sore.”</p> <p>I slid my fingers down the small of her back and between her legs. “Don’t worry, it’s going to be just right,” I said.</p> <p>“Are you sure?” she asked, her breath coming in short, short bursts.</p> <p>I rolled her across the couch, then sat up. She raised her bum off the seat, then positioned herself on her hands and knees between my legs. I slid between them, looking down her body in the dim light above the couch. She lifted her thighs and rested them over the arms of the couch, then stretched them out slightly, then lowered them, putting an even greater strain on them. I felt her vagina envelop me in warm, wet heat, and I could sense a dampness forming in there.</p> <p>She watched as I touched her gently, almost teasingly, and began to work up the nerve endings on my own body. My fingers probed her outer lips. I moved slowly, teasingly, feeling every little bump in her, and could almost see the ridges of her erect clit peeking from beneath its sheath. I looked up at her face, the flush spreading through her body, and watched her face as I slid a single digit inside her. She was wet, slick, and slippery around me. She smiled, her features changing slightly – the first sign of her arousal, and it was evident in her movements.</p> <p>“God,” she whispered, staring up at me through her eyelashes, “You feel so hard!”</p> <p>I thrust a second finger up into her, curving my fingers up and around her G-spot. She let out a tiny moan that vibrated through the thin membrane between her vaginal and cervix. I saw her stomach contract in a slow spasm, and her hands squeezed her breasts tightly. Her breathing quickened, her chest thrust out. She was about to climax. I was about to cum.</p> <p>I felt her muscles flutter slightly as she let it out, but I didn’t care.
