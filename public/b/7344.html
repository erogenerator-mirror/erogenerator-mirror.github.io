You know, you have a lot more experience."</p> <p>She stood there smiling, "I guess you're right though." With that, she walked away from me, took a drink of water and started walking away from the table.</p> <p>I walked to the door of the bar that the waiter had been in, stood for a second in front of it. I looked over at her, she was looking over her paper again, just as if she wasn't even there. The waiter came back up to the table and told us that he'd be out of hearing in a second so the server was back with more paper. Just as his secretary was leaving, a young handsome man walked up to the bar around the corner, he looked like what she remembered, tall and well built, I couldn't help but wonder where he might be from.</p> <p>Just as the waiter came back down to the bar, I turned my head and looked to the window that gave just the perfect view of the park. In the distance was the sound of kids playing catch, singing "Scout for a sport" or "Boys in the Park", I wasn't sure, but whatever. I took a drink of water and finished it off. As I stood at the bar looking over the paper, it became apparent that no one sat down on that particular table. I figured I wouldn't have to look for another half hour but the wait would start to get more interesting as the night progressed. I looked up at her, just as she was walking by me.</p> <p>I stood up and said, "Is this the best restaurant around or what?"</p> <p>She turned and looked at me and her eyes got as big as the moon, I was staring into them, my heart seemed to skip a beat and I couldn't read anything in them. "No!"</p> <p>I said, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to insult you."</p> <p>She gave me a half-smile and reached out her hand. I took it, she didn't pull away. I took her hand, she didn't try to pull away. We stood there talking for another minute. "Well I guess you made an impression on me now," She said. "Are you looking for a date?" A bit flustered, I wasn't sure if that was her answer.</p> <p>Instead of going to the back of the bar, I walked over to where her was sitting, took her hand and led her back to the table. I gave her a deep kiss on the lips before we sat down. I was getting to know her differently. I liked her; the way she looked in her dress, the feel of her hand in mine. I couldn't be sure if she was having second thoughts. Did we really have a chance to date?</p> <p>The waiter came back over with our menus and took our orders. I told her to take a piece of ice cream from the bowl, which she did, she had the flavor of chocolate. "That was good," she said.</p> <p>My heart started pounding as I looked over at her, she wasn't smiling really, but as I looked over at her face, I saw that same little smile. "I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable," she said.</p> <p>"No, no, don't be, you really don't have to be uncomfortable, it's not that I'm not attracted to you, I was just wondering if something about you that you're interested in is like that."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sure we have some great times together. Why did you think I looked for something else?" She took another bite into her bite, I could tell by her movements and by the way she was looking at me.</p> <p>"That's okay, I like you a lot."</p> <p>I wasn't sure if I was ready to say anything more, but we talked for a while, it seemed that our conversation wasn't that affected either. We didn't say much about what happened in that park, because we were both in very deep feelings of guilt about what happened earlier that night in our bedroom and didn't need to say anything. I was very aware and was beginning to really worry about what kind of man she was in high school and the way this had happened to her. I didn't say anything either, I was ready and willing to do it again.</p> <p>We finished our order, I looked over to her as I got up to put the plate into the bin behind the counter. "I'm going to take a walk. Would you like me to stop at one of the tables?" She reached one hand over to shake mine and I let hers go. "No, I don't want to go in there."</p> <p>"But you said you were interested in moreâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
