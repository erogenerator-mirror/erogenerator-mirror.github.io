You remember, Jake."</p> <p>She took in his rugged, square yet smooth skin with the strong chin, that would make any girl melt. His light blue eyes were captivating and her mind felt it was her duty to draw him into her inner being. She smiled as she remembered back to back times when their sex life was wild and wild. For the first time she did not mind that he had been cheating on her, she did not mind that he had become her lover. Sarah loved the way men reacted when he was on top of her, that he always put his weight to her every time they made love and how it showed on the back of his jeans when he held her tight in his arms. But she knew now to be the right person to do those things, now she wanted it to show again and again.</p> <p>"Well, I have to ask...?"</p> <p>Sarah was thinking to herself. She had to get back up the courage to speak and yet she wanted so badly to do that.</p> <p>"You can call me Sarah, that's my real name."</p> <p>Jake's hands cupped her face as he gently brushed his lips on her lips. His arms moved up and down her cheeks as his lips moved to her jaw and kissed every square inch of it. He loved this part so much that he had to press his lips to hers to gain entry to her mouth to speak. The feel of it sent a shudder down her body as his lips slowly trailed to her lips. Jake's tongue played at the soft inside of her mouth, exploring and caressing as his lips met hers. His hands moved down her face and slowly slid underneath her shirt. He wanted so bad to feel more skin on his hands touch. He wanted to make the skin of his hands slide over her warm, supple skin and feel it. He wanted to see the soft skin of her breasts and her erect nipples that always came so easily to him. He wanted to suck on them and let her feel the hardness of his cock that was between his legs. He had wanted to do that for a long time now to her, ever since she had told him about her desire to taste his cum. Sarah's nipples were already swollen and erect from his attention, and he wanted to suck on them. The feeling of his lips on her mouth made her yearning to have him next. Sarah had always wanted his tongue on her nipples. She remembered back when they were younger and had touched him in many other ways, but now a new desire came to her and her nipples were being caressed and fondled as she felt Jake's tongue caressing hers as they were kissing. She remembered being in a bathroom of both her and Michael's parties, when she had caught them in a fit of passion. She had heard Michael telling her what time it was and that he had gotten it for the last one. She had gone up stairs and looked at Michael's old room that he had left to his lover, but there had been more passion in the room.</p> <p>After that, she had tried to call Michael and see if she could get his number. She had wanted so bad to call him and tell him all about her night and what had happened when she was at her friends house after the party. But now all she could do was ask Michael. Her heart was in her mouth already.</p> <p>"Ok, here are the tickets, the tickets are for a big ball at 7 PM but I am not expecting you." Sarah gave a smile as she got up and put her arm around Jake as she gave a peck on his lips.</p> <p>Jake nodded weakly as he felt Sarah's hand on his leg, and a warm tingle run through him. He was so nervous, he didn't know when they were going to do this, but he knew this was the opportunity that he had been waiting for. As Sarah leaned in to share a passionate kiss with him, his thoughts drifted to when he would be able to get that tongue of his, and it would just happen with him. Jake was so excited to know that she was in this man's arms, she really had come to love him for what he is. His hand moved to the back of her neck to cup her face as his lips sought her lips and lightly stroked her cheek before he closed his palm over her soft cheek. With her lips pressed to his, he knew he could crush her heart to the floor. All the years and days waiting had taught him to never let a woman go and it was the only time that he felt like he could be alone with her. Maybe tonight was tonight. Maybe tomorrow night if he got back to his room, but tonight he was really alone. He pulled Sarah's lips off to stare atâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
