She was about her late thirties, pretty and very attractive. I could see she was well dressed and very professional. She did not have an enormous rack, but a very nice body with large firm breasts and a rather nice set of buttocks.</p> <p>She turned a corner and looked towards us. She was just out of my line of sight, but I could not tell where she was. Her uniform was an open, dark blue blouse, tight over a pair of very nice young looking breasts, and her skirt and jacket were rather short. The skirt was short and fairly tight which showed off much of her shapely leg, and there were a couple of buttons on top undone. There was not much more to her body beyond those, but I could see her large nipples. They were quite long, pinkish pink with small protrubs, and when she bent over, her skirt rode higher up her thighs towards her pussy. There were just a couple of inches of pale flesh between her thighs, and even that was a mystery to me. I could see that the young woman, in the middle of making a call to the telephone, had undone the top button of her uniform as we were chatting, and that seemed to be the point of the call. She made two or three calls and left the handset to hang up to answer it, so all our attention was in the brief contact with her. As she came to the end of the call, I felt like I had been caught checking out a very attractive woman again.</p> <p>"Hi," I said quietly, and she smiled and looked up. She wore a soft yellow and navy blue top, almost as tight as her uniform. The buttons were just starting to open and revealed a full rounded, firm buttock. The skirt fitted her nicely, and at the knee she had it bent over slightly at the waist to show off more. I looked at her again and she looked at me again. I said nothing. I was not sure if she was in a good mood or she wanted to try something else, or both, but it seemed that she was clearly enjoying what we were having, just to see me looking in her direction.</p> <p>The second call went exactly like this, and all our conversation was in the next room. We kept in touch and talked on a regular basis till her company ended. I could not wait for next day when I would meet her and she came for her break. As the phone rang I kept my eyes on the monitor and did not turn a part of my body which was also turned toward her. She picked up the receiver, turned toward the office and gave me a gentle hug. She said something that could have been an apology, but which seemed to be unnecessary. I was sure that she had no idea what she was asking me, but her eyes and body were also moving in my direction. I was sure of it. This was not good. What was going through a woman's head?</p> <p>I turned the monitor off and got into my car. It felt strange to drive in traffic and this time did not have my hand on the wheel. It may seem strange, but I have an almost regular hand. There is much to love about driving, but it has nothing to do with an occasional erection. I was surprised that I only had to stop at the stop sign, but I was in my car. I could only wonder how the driver, who I assumed was going to be driving, had known I would be looking at her legs. Maybe she was thinking I looked out at her as well. I did not think that would be the case.</p> <p>That night I received a call from my brother in Iraq, telling me that another guy had shot at his platoon commander and was going to be killed. I had never heard about it. He said that one day he would tell the commanders that the person they were waiting to send him was just a man and I should not be involved in killing him. He left very quickly. I took note of it, and decided to stay and talk with my sister at night.</p> <p>I have always hated coming to sleep while someone else was in the vicinity. It is very nice to stay awake with someone else. For some reason it made me think of what my father was like. My father was a rather nice person, but there would be no need for him at all. I was not sure what was going on, so I stayed with a couple of friends while I was trying to concentrate on school. The next day I was very tired after the workday and went to bed early. I had the usual hangover which made me feel good. After a late night of some serious pot hangovers, I had the typical hangover of being in hospital for the first time in my life.</p> <p>I thought of an article I had written for the Wall Street Journal a year before when we hadâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
