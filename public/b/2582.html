It's a long story, sweetie. You've got quite a number of questions to ask before I answer," she said, kissing him lightly on the lips.</p> <p>"First, how did the party get started? I mean..."</p> <p>"Well, my dad had the idea to invite a lot of nice people, including his old buddy Jim, to our party. We kind of went off to the party when we knew you'd be around, and there were always other people there too. The girls were all hot in their birthday suits, and we all had a great time. A lot of guys got a little carried away with the booze and the way they all looked at you. You got the same reaction from everyone. We knew you had a good time at the party too, so we knew we had to have you," she told him.</p> <p>"So, how did you find out about my mom and dad then? You know, as you said, 'A lot of people are going to be going to the party', right?"</p> <p>"Yes, I know. We didn't know how it was going to go, although we thought it would be fun to invite a lot of people. Anyway, we were all on the same wavelength when we talked about how the party would turn out, so we went with it, even though we weren't sure how you would react," she said, smiling. "It kind of made the first time all the more exciting, you know?"</p> <p>"It sure did, honey. I hope you feel a lot better if you take that as a compliment...that you feel free to make things up to me anytime you want," he told her.</p> <p>"Well, if I get free drinks, I'll probably be more relaxed. I know Jim's going to be disappointed, and I think we can wait until after the party, but it's worth it to have a few more drinks, so you can tell him later, okay?"</p> <p>"Yeah, it's kind of a relief. Are you two okay with Jim and me going on such a big date? Are you not happy?"</p> <p>They laughed a couple of seconds, "Not quite as uncomfortable when we're alone with you," they both replied.</p> <p>It was good to see them, and it was fun to talk to them. All the things they'd done in the last few weeks and their adventures with Jim and Lisa had made the night just as interesting and erotic as it had been previously.</p> <p>"Well, this is probably not the time for the big talk, but I know it will be more comfortable when we get back to bed," Lisa said.</p> <p>"Great, that's great," Jim agreed. "Would you mind if we took it into consideration? We still have to decide on the party, and we might have to take a chance that you would want to come," Jim said, a little worried.</p> <p>"Sure. I wouldn't mind, anyway."</p> <p>They both snuggled up, and drifted off to sleep in the afterglow. Jim was dreaming he was in a bed with Lisa. A few minutes later they were in the same bed, and Jim's body was covered with a sheet, which was pulled over them so that their eyes couldn't be seen. They talked for a while about their jobs, and Jim asked her about her family and her job. They didn't discuss any of that, since they were too busy to talk about it right now.</p> <p>"Well, it's been a while since I've been there," Lisa said.</p> <p>"I know, too." Jim said. "I mean, Jim, we really want to see what it's like to be together with a guy. I've always wanted to be with a woman, even when my boyfriend and I broke up."</p> <p>"I know, baby, me too. I've thought about it for a long time now. I was really nervous when we met, but once I got to know the guys, I didn't care. Now, I really think I'd really like to be with a couple."</p> <p>"So? How will you get down into the guy's pants?" Jim asked.</p> <p>She laughed, "We'd have to go into an elevator before we do that, since we're having sex right now, you know? I don't want to do it in a man's room, like with a guy's. I'm not sure what to do next, but if either one of us has an erection, well, it would be a lot easier to just go for it, doesn't it?"</p> <p>Jim laughed as well. "Of course it doesn't have to be any more obvious that way, I know. I'd have to go to a guy's room if I had to do that for himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
