Just don't you dare touch your pussy or your tits, okay?" The girl nodded with a look of confusion, tears spilling from her eyes.</p> <p>"You don't have to say no to me. Just go with the flow," the girl whispered back to him in her soft, sensual tone. "Just don't touch your tits. Don't even think about it." He let his fingers trace through the dark hair which started at the base of her neck, his lips brushing against it before he lifted her chin in his hand and raised her face so she could see her eyes.</p> <p>"You just have to ask," she asked, but her words were lost under her heavy breathing.</p> <p>"I want to be with you again more often and I have," he said with a kiss before he lifted her head up and kissed her tenderly, passionately.</p> <p>"I want to make you happy in whatever way I can, okay?" She breathed, her eyes locked to his.</p> <p>"Absolutely," he agreed, before letting go of her, "Go get dressed. I don't want to take your money, ok?" He stepped past her and, just outside, he put a hand on the girl's shoulder to give it a good shake.</p> <p>She glanced down at the bulge in his jeans, "You might want to let me pay you so you don't have to pick me up. I promise nothing will happen between us."</p> <p>He gave a small laugh and stepped away without a word, letting her walk with him to the car, then following her back to her room.</p> <p>"It's not what you think, is it?" the girl asked, her cheeks turning red as she stared at him from the doorway of her room. There was a look of disappointment on her face, but the girl gave him a smirk as if she had no idea what to expect.</p> <p>"Is not what I think, either," he replied, and she smiled shyly. It took a lot for him not to laugh.</p> <p>***</p> <p>"Honey, why don't you get some sleep for a while and I'll be right out," he said when she came out of her room just as he was getting ready to leave. He wrapped his arms tightly around her waist and kissed the nape of her cute neck while she laid her head on his chest. "I'm going back inside and come back and make my arrangements. I'll be back to take care of you any time you need help." He kissed her tenderly on the lips and walked out the door, going directly to the elevator.</p> <p>"Mmmm," she purred, "that was perfect." He kissed her lightly on the lips, sending a shiver down her body. He loved the way she always looked the most amazing when she left. After all, he couldn't very well just walk away from her right then, right there.</p> <p>He watched her with a smile as he stepped into the elevator and then went to his car. As he sat in the drivers' seat he remembered that the girl looked just like the one he'd seen in his dream, with her hair and a beautiful face. He had to remember her that way.</p> <p>***</p> <p>That evening, Alex was finishing up dinner, when he heard his name being called by his wife calling his name from his bedroom. He took a deep breath and leaned his head back against the pillow for a long moment as he prepared to listen to his wife's voice. He'd been feeling a little guilty about that since she'd said that he had to help her. She'd already made her decision and she could not let it get to this point.</p> <p>As usual, he was sitting at home alone that night waiting and counting the dollars. And he could not wait to hear the sweet, sexy voice of his lover so close his ear. He couldn't wait to see her again tonight, but he had better things to do now before he lost himself in thought.</p> <p>At that point in the evening, Alex was in no hurry and just did what he had to do. As he went toward the computer, there was a knock on the screen. He opened his eyes to see the same girl that'd said he was leaving for work and she was just sitting there, on her bed.</p> <p>He looked up to see her staring at him. She looked back up at him with a wicked smile, "How about dinner? You'll be back on time, so I thought we could have a little fun." Alex looked at the girl with what he hoped would be the innocent look of a man who'd never even dreamed of asking a woman out on a date.</p> <p>"Okay, sure," he replied, moving over to the bed to sit down nextâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
