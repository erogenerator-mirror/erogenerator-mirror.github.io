My voice was a whisper. "I didn't imagine you were so eager to meet me, and I just wanted to hear you say it again."</p> <p>"Well..." she said cautiously.</p> <p>"Well, you said you want to take me back to my place. What happened last night..." I looked into her eyes and saw a spark in them. "You said, "You never asked me to come back here but now you do." She started crying.</p> <p>"I... I just..." she said quietly in a shaky voice. I couldn't believe she had said the words that had driven me to coming here. I held her face in my hands and said, "Baby, I'm sorry. I need you right this very moment. I'm sorry I broke up with you, and I was angry at the time, but this whole thing just hurt so much." She took my face in her hands and squeezed.</p> <p>As she calmed down a little, I said, "I love you too," and she hugged me, her tears starting to run out. "I guess it's the beginning of our friendship."</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she looked into my eyes. I thought that she might say that she didn't regret what we did last night, but to me, she hadn't. I held on to her for a while, letting her hold my body just out of my reach.</p> <p>Then I kissed her. I put my arms around her and hugged her. She started to relax against me. At last we broke the embrace and hugged. I held her tight, so no one would have to find out that we hadn't slept together naked on top of the sheets.</p> <p>I kissed her cheek and told her that everything was OK. She smiled and whispered she loved me. I started to move away, but she held me tighter. I kissed her forehead and then said gently that I wanted to be with her too. She pulled herself off me and looked at me. "We can change. This is the best we can do, that is until I know better."</p> <p>I smiled and hugged her again. "I'm so glad we can do this."</p> <p>Chapter 6</p> <p>"How is it that you can know that you love?" She leaned forward and put a hand on my face.</p> <p>I looked up at her. "Oh, I love you more than I ever thought possible."</p> <p>She paused for a moment. Then she said, "I love you a lot."</p> <p>She kissed me full on the lips. I put her hand on my breast and put my hand to her cheek. That felt so soft. "I love you so much, Lizzie, that I can't tell you the real truth."</p> <p>"That's good to hear," she smiled. She reached out her hand and ran it down my body. "My whole body, right down to my pussy. Can we do that more?"</p> <p>"Well, maybe later."</p> <p>"Good," she said and kissed me again. "Just keep thinking what it would feel like to have you inside me, and when you're ready to come inside me, you can do that."</p> <p>Chapter 7</p> <p>A very strong orgasm was approaching. "I'm going to come," I whispered.</p> <p>"Me too," she whispered back. I held her head and kissed her. Then I slipped out of bed and put on some silk boxers, so soft to get her in. She looked around the room and saw the light on. "Wow! Where did...?" I wondered, "What if someone saw?" but instead said, "It's the bathroom."</p> <p>"No, I brought my toiletry kit," Lizzie said. I grabbed her bag and pulled her to me.</p> <p>"I don't feel well," she laughed as we left the bedroom. Then she kissed me again. "Now we don't have to hurry," she smiled. "Here, I'll wash the condom off and you can go get your shower."</p> <p>Once in the bathroom, she helped wash me and I did the same for her. We kissed again. I took the condom and put it in the hamper. "Don't forget the lotion," I whispered to her. "Oh, I'm going to love you so much."</p> <p>There was a knock on the door. "Honey, is it really you?"</p> <p>"Well, I think there is someone here," I said, running to get my shower. This girl was going to turn into one of the sexiest women I've ever known. She was very beautiful. And I loved it.</p> <p>Once in the shower, Lizzie wrapped me in a large bath towel and helped me out of the tubâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
