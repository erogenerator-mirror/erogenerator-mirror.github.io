James jumped up and led us both to the door.</p> <p>When the door was shut, we got out of the tub, walked arm in arm until we got to the tub, and climbed into it. We both were so wet we could have used just a bathrobe or swim suit. We started kissing each other. We were soon making out in total bliss. I felt his hands going up my legs, and feeling that bulge there was like a jolt through my body.</p> <p>"Is the water hot?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes." He answered.</p> <p>"I think it will be nice when we can do this again." I told him.</p> <p>"I want you to take your robe off, too!" he said with a devilish smile.</p> <p>"I can't think of a man that wouldn't take off his robe, knowing that I have already stripped naked." I told him.</p> <p>"That's good, because I'm going to be naked for the next few hours, so I can't wait!"</p> <p>"Good, because I'm going to be naked too." I told him.</p> <p>"Good!" he said with a grin as he slipped his robe off, and started to undressing.</p> <p>"I have to say, you are pretty sexy when you get naked."</p> <p>"Yes you have a big cock, and I'm glad that you found this place so easily." I said as I took a nipple into my mouth.</p> <p>James just grinned and stroked it hard. I was going to let him fuck me so he could cum in my mouth or pussy.</p> <p>"I think maybe we could do it in the hot tub for a while, since we have to get to sleep soon." he said.</p> <p>We got out the hot tub and went to our room. We got in and went back to the bed.</p> <p>"My, aren't we a little excited!" I said with a laugh.</p> <p>"Yes we are."</p> <p>I stripped off my robe and we embraced. I felt James hand slowly slide down over side my mound and then felt him enter me. Just as I was getting used to it, James picked me up and laid me down on the bed while he continued to pound me from behind. His fingers were working down my slit and I was starting to feel hot.</p> <p>"I'm not a little girl." I said.</p> <p>He just laughed. "Well, maybe we should wait, for a little longer."</p> <p>I had to roll over so that his cock would enter me.</p> <p>"James."</p> <p>"Yes?"</p> <p>"This feels different," and I felt his fingers find my clitoris, "it's all the way out of my pussy."</p> <p>"That is great."</p> <p>"I'm so glad that you can feel this way!" He said.</p> <p>"No, we aren't through. You are going to have to do it a lot with my hand, or maybe both of our mouths." I said.</p> <p>He just laughed, "Oh, I see what they are referring to."</p> <p>"We wouldn't want to do it that way," I said.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"You wouldn't like it!" I protested.</p> <p>"I would!" He said.</p> <p>He was right, but just to hear me say that was enough to make me want him even more.</p> <p>We finished up a little while later at the end of the long drive home. The windows had fogged up, and we could barely see inside the garage, and as we got out of the car we started feeling more at ease. We were both still completely naked, and I could feel him still had his clothes on.</p> <p>"Thank you, for thinking so much about me earlier!" I said.</p> <p>"That's for sure!" he said just a little too eagerly.</p> <p>We left the garage and went to the door and it slid open. We both walked in first, just out of the house so that I could start to change in the master bedroom. We had to climb the stairs to the second floor first, so we went up again.</p> <p>I found me on the second bedroom's king-sized bed, with one of James' shirts hanging off of it.</p> <p>"Take those off and lie down." He ordered me.</p> <p>When I was lying down, he had one side of the shirt bunched up around my waist, and I could see that he was getting himself hard just by looking at my tits.</p> <p>"If you want me to go into the bathroom, you can sit up for a bit of privacy." He told me.</p> <p>I didn'tâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
