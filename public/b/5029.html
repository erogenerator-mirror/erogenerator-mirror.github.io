The man that's about to fuck you up the ass!" She laughs and I give her a stern look. This is all part of the game. You don't always win, but you do find a woman, one you enjoy. Especially one who doesn't mind having sex in the back seat of your car, or on the bus. You are just that much bigger.</p> <p>"I can't believe you are actually going to rape my ass!" She says laughing. I'm surprised. For a few seconds we were silent. Then I hear her laugh too. Then I hear her laugh. We both laugh some more.</p> <p>"I don't even know if I've had this much fun. Can we keep this going?" She says.</p> <p>"How are we going to keep this going?" I say. I have no desire to be any more than the "hero" that she is now. I want to be able to control her body, or make her mine. I want to control her mind, or her body, but I know that we can't. "You wouldn't have sex with me if I wasn't your girlfriend." I laugh to myself realizing that this is way over the top for the both of us. I'm a really good lover, but this conversation is getting too personal.</p> <p>"I don't want you to get pissed if we keep doing this, ok?" She says. I smile a little at her. If I didn't know better.</p> <p>"Ok, but maybe not the whole truth." I say finally.</p> <p>"That's up to you. But I'm not going to change my mind if you tell me what you're going to do and don't want to be like you are now." She says back to me.</p> <p>"I'd like to be like you when you start acting like you're more than a man. Not a man I have to say. But what about the rest of us?" I say.</p> <p>"I think a lot more about you than what I know I've already said. The sex is going better without you trying to force me into something that I want." She says.</p> <p>"Ok, now what are we going to do?" I ask.</p> <p>"What do you think we're going to do?" She says. "Ohhh, we're going to get us some of that weed, I think some crack in your head." She giggles. I laugh and get myself into the conversation, as it's getting around to where I'm going to tell her that I'm not as horny as she is.</p> <p>And I'm going to tell her now. I start out on a new journey, with her.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p>Part 6</p> <p>And that's the kind of story I write because I like reading things that make me crazy. Don't worry. It has no gay or bi lines. It has a lot of straight stuff in it. It's a story.</p> <p>The characters are not real. In a way, it makes us want to see more. A lot more. That's why a lot of people are writing stories about real-life relationships. If you don't like these stories about people you don't know (like I am or are actually involved in a sexual relationship), you don't have to go there as well. Because this is all fantasy, all the rest is just a part of real life.</p> <p>And it's not bad.</p> <p>-â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
