For sure!" She laughed, again.</p> <p>He took the coffee and walked out the back of the shop. He walked back to the bar where he could get his laptop and get started on his paper then, before he could do that to his mother, she walked back.</p> <p>She wasn't waiting for him this time. The two of them were in the middle of talking when she reached him.</p> <p>"I want you to come and look at my paper. I'll show you where I got all my drawings, where I learned to work on it."</p> <p>He stared back at her, and took in the sight she was presenting him. He never took his eyes off of her.</p> <p>"You are beautiful." He said quietly.</p> <p>"You are too!"</p> <p>She turned as he turned then.</p> <p>"What you're doing here isn't the best for what you're doing for me."</p> <p>He shook his head in reply.</p> <p>"You don't even realize how lucky I am and how proud I am of you. My heart is pounding as I stand in front of you. I am the luckiest man in the world." He turned to look at her again.</p> <p>"What? What have you done for me?"</p> <p>He smiled.</p> <p>"I've been working for you since kindergarten."</p> <p>"I take it you're not really going to work here?"</p> <p>"This is different!" He laughed.</p> <p>"I'm not going to work here if you don't work for me. You're free for the break," she said and she took a piece of paper away from him. "I need this job and I need you to work here for me."</p> <p>"Thank you."</p> <p>"You're welcome. Now, have you had enough coffee?"</p> <p>He nodded yes and left the store.</p> <p>***</p> <p>"Well, I don't believe this. You've been living here for a couple of years but it seems like someone is giving you a good working over. You seem to enjoy it though. Are you having success?"</p> <p>"Well no and I definitely haven't."</p> <p>"I'm thinking you'll find out. Now, you want up and out. There's coffee here. I'll get you a cup and you can look at your paper there while you drink it."</p> <p>"Well, thank you. You're just trying to get my attention."</p> <p>She smiled to herself when she thought, "Maybe you do. And I really like your attention. Thanks again."</p> <p>"Yes, thank you." She took another sip of the coffee and the thought of looking at her paper again brought back the same thoughts he was having about her writing while she drank the cup. She smiled to herself.</p> <p>"So, do you have any drawings?"</p> <p>"I never do." He chuckled. "We just sit down and talk. It's really a nice place. I'm kind of busy."</p> <p>"Well, there's not much going on here. I like the place but I usually spend a lot of the time in the shop. And you've done a lot more than that. I find you interesting. Thank you, you're so sweet."</p> <p>She laughed. "I never thought you'd offer that."</p> <p>"I didn't, but you're an attractive one. And you sure are making lots of drawings here."</p> <p>"We don't do very much; I have more than a couple of students."</p> <p>"But you make quite an income. You've got the most beautiful body I've ever seen. You have great legs from just walking out here and looking at you but we're not the kind of people who would take pride in seeing us. Don't give that up, sweetheart."</p> <p>"We're not getting a lot of work in that part of the shop."</p> <p>"Oh!" He paused.</p> <p>"Well, we don't have many things we need to do for an afternoon. Why don't we sit down and chat for a while?"</p> <p>"There's a sofa there."</p> <p>"Sure, there is. It's right along the back," she pointed to the sofa.</p> <p>He sat down opposite of her. They spent about a minute talking and he decided the chair was a good seat in the room.</p> <p>"Would you like to read a book?"</p> <p>"That would be very nice. Maybe I can put it on paper."</p> <p>"Well, I have an interest in reading the history of the great cities of England. We could meet sometime and talk about the history of the city."</p> <p>"You really wantâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
