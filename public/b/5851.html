He said and she did so, looking up at him with a strange look, she could feel her pussy tingling as though it wanted to be touched.</p> <p>"What are you, Sir?"</p> <p>"Just you, darling." He responded immediately as he slipped one hand down on top of the other. He leaned down and kissed her deeply as her tongue danced and wrestled with his. When he broke from her kiss he said,</p> <p>"How do your needs become more specific." He asked her and she didn't answer but he kissed her again as his hand came back up and caressed and pulled at her breasts. He could feel her whole body quivering just slightly as a tremble went through her and she tried to turn away.</p> <p>"Not yet, Sir." she said to him with a giggle. He let up and began to kiss her nipples; the first to come erect. Their mouths clamped onto each others as he pinched and tugged at them and she could feel wetness beginning to build. She was breathing faster and faster as he worked on her breasts; his kisses now wet, his fingers running up and down her belly. She moaned into his mouth almost begging him to take off his clothes. He didn't disappoint her.</p> <p>He stood, pulling down his boxers revealing his very erect and rock hard cock and she felt a tingle go through her at that very thought. He walked over to her, his hand slipping from her breast up to her neck and then down to cup her small breast. He started kissing down her neck and over her collar bone until he reached her breast. She moaned as he flicked her hard nipple and began to kiss and caress her breast. Her pussy was tingling but she didn't want him to touch her.</p> <p>"Sir, I'm afraid I may..." she tried to plead as she felt his hand slide down her body and between her legs. He slowly slid it up and under her shirt and she gasped as he slipped a finger through the opening of her pussy lips. He slid a finger inside her and curled it up. She felt as though a thick, sticky fluid was being pushed around and she could feel her own juices coating his hand.</p> <p>"Don't you dare cum while you're doing that to me." his voice was almost a growl as he continued to manipulate and finger her.</p> <p>"Please, Sir." she whimpered but he continued to finger her and kiss her breasts. He slowly slipped a finger inside her body and felt it as the muscles spasmed.</p> <p>"I think you can do better than that, love" he whispered in her ear as he let his hand slide down, slowly working up and down along her leg. He slipped two fingers between her legs and she began to slowly rock herself against them. His fingers continued to pump inside of her pussy as the warm liquid was sliding out, down the slit on each outward stroke. He felt her tense as her nipples were harder than they had ever been in her life. He worked up his finger and began to use his hand like the handle of a riding crop when she began to thrust against him. He took his hand off her and moved between her legs. She felt his cock against her stomach as he slowly pushed inside her, stretching her pussy even further still.</p> <p>"That's all you have to do." he told her with a smile and she nodded slowly in the direction of his bedroomâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
