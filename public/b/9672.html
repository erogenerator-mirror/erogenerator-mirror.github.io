You're right." I smiled, glad to see that she was not so disappointed with my answer. "I guess I still don't do the right thing, though, so I'd be lying if I said I hadn't had a chance to think it through."</p> <p>"I think you have." She kissed me, our lips still locked tightly but beginning to become more urgent. "Let's go to the next part." The lights flashed again.</p> <p>"Are you sure you can stand up?" I asked.</p> <p>"Very, very much so!" She stepped away from me. "I suppose it should make perfect sense?" I stood very still, trying not to think back toward the last time I had thought through the decision with any kind of certainty. Did I really just decide that I was going to seduce her? I felt her press against me, pushing me even harder, making me realize what a big mistake it had made me making my decision on this particular path. My stomach started doing flip-flops again.</p> <p>"Would you do something with your hands if I told you to?" I nodded my head without thinking. I think that I still didn't know what was going on. I looked up and saw her standing a few inches from me. Was she staring at us? Had she noticed what we were up to? Did she actually feel the same way that I did? What had she expected? Was I doing the right thing? Did I know what to expect when ever she was willing to take on me?</p> <p>"I'm sorry to tell you this, but I am very flattered, especially in the circumstances we've just met," she said softly. Her voice was much softer. "The pleasure you are about to experience is very much appreciated." That was it. She stepped back, grabbed my hand, and led me to the bedroom. "Lie down, on the king-size bed with your head between my legs." Again I nodded my head. "I'm a little disappointed in you now."</p> <p>I took a deep breath and slowly lowered myself to the bed. It was a big bed. The lights were low to start with but now came on in full intensity. I glanced over my shoulder when I got to the base of it and saw that a very naked woman was lying beneath me, legs wide open. I felt my erection twitch as I looked at her. Her eyes were closed. I heard her sigh deeply. It made me turn my head so that she could take in the entire size of my entire body, even the hair at my crotch that I could not see clearly. Her breasts were large, with large, dark, hard nipples. I felt like I was going to lose my mind with this woman's beauty. I could feel her hand caressing my lower back.</p> <p>The fingers on her right hand found my lower back. They moved down to the base of my buttocks, caressing them lightly. I started to lower myself but she grabbed my hands and held them, pushing us apart. "Let me know how it feels." The woman I had thought I had known was still lying there, smiling at us.</p> <p>"I don't think we'll have much difficulty," she said, "but I'm sure you want to be a part of it."</p> <p>"It would only be a few seconds," I answered.</p> <p>The woman who I had just been kissing before opened her eyes and turned her face toward me. "Are you sure you don't want me to stop you from having a chance?"</p> <p>"There's no better time that I can ever forget." I answered, trying to be as direct as possible.</p> <p>"Are you sure you don't want to do what we just did?" She seemed to hesitate. "We won't do anything you don't want to do."</p> <p>"I'm not sure," I told her. "I just don't want to hurt you."</p> <p>"Not at all." The woman took my hands and moved them to her pussy. They made a very soft, gentle touch. She made some sort of gesture with her fingertips and they came up to my fingers. She made it look like she stroked them.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want this?" With the next question, she looked at me seriously. "I'm sure."</p> <p>I nodded then took a deep breath. As I lowered myself, my erection slipped past her pussy lips and into the soft, warm, wet cavern of her pussy.</p> <p>"Oh!" She moaned. "That feels so good." Even though she was moaning as much as I was, her pussy lips were much softer than my hands had ever been. I started stroking her slowly as she moved, in turn guiding my movements. She was so aroused, a little dizzy, and wet. I let my weight restâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
