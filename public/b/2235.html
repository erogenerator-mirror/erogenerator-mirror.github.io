Now we're good."</p> <p>"I guess. I like you." I agreed, "Thanks." And I hung up my phone but did see a text which was from her parents, "It's over. We're good now and we'll see you soon. I have a good time." I left my office without looking back. It was late and I was at a loss. What was I going to do with myself before I told my parents? I couldn't tell any of my business associates what happened between us.</p> <p>As I was walking out the door, I was stopped by a knock at the door. I took a deep breath and opened the door. Julie was standing there. She had a smirk on her face. I wanted to make a scene or maybe even run, but I couldn't and I didn't as I walked in and she walked over to where I stood. She put her arms up to my shoulders and put them down. I knew I was in trouble and I couldn't make her change her mind but I wanted to do whatever it took to get it. She smiled at me and her smile gave me butterflies. "You ready lover?" she asked with a wink.</p> <p>"You better." I answered with my mind racing. She reached out and grabbed me and kissed me roughly. I felt her tongue trying to enter my mouth but I pushed her away.</p> <p>"No. Let's get this over with" I said to her.</p> <p>"We don't have a problem." She said giving me a smirk and pulling away.</p> <p>"No, we don't." I said trying to think of where this was going. "Look I'm your boss and you get to decide that." We walked out the door and walked to her car. She opened the door and I got in right behind her. I held her hips and started to get into the car. "Do you still want to work in this place or would you rather go home?"</p> <p>"Ok." she said. "I don't want to talk about it right now. You can have the house. We'll see you tomorrow." She said and started her car. I drove back to my office and started getting a lot of work done.</p> <p>I looked at myself in the mirror. Why did she have to drive when it was all business. I would never have guessed she was this jealous. I sighed and tried to focus my mind. I was starting to see a pattern to how we were going. She would get her way a lot of the time and I would get mine.</p> <p>That's the problem with our family. We had different views on the world but we did try to keep in touch. Now we had a different relationship with no real ties. I had been thinking of that for a while when I was thinking about what happened between us. We didn't keep in touch and were busy living things that would have felt different to each of us. I couldn't shake the thought that maybe things went as far as we felt. I started to feel that way again a second time.</p> <p>The next day my mother was off on a business trip to Europe. I wanted to go with her but couldn't make it. She would need to take me to the airport, but I did. We met up with Julie's old friend, Melissa, and we ate dinner together. By lunch I was feeling more relaxed and I got the feeling that I wasn't going to have to make the most of the time alone with Julie and her friend.</p> <p>When Julie arrived, she was carrying a couple of bags. The first bag was her bikini top on the floor. The second bag was her teddy on the floor next to the bed. She sat down at the window and picked it up and started sorting through the clothes on the floor. She looked over at me with a puzzled look.</p> <p>"Where are the bags?" We both looked to see who was in the room and saw a black suit lying on the floor next to the bed.</p> <p>"I got these for you." She said tossing the bag on the bed.</p> <p>"They should fit you," she added.</p> <p>"They're yours." I added.</p> <p>"Yeah, I know, I know. Your top and bottoms are my bikini top and I'll take them when the time comes." I saw her expression change a little.</p> <p>"Ok." I said walking over to her and kissing her on the cheek, "Now let's get you out of these clothes" I said as I started to undo the knot at her back.</p> <p>"I'm not sure I want to get these on so soon." Julie said as she grabbed my face and kissed me hungrily.</p> <p>"No hurry." I replied as I started to get out ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
