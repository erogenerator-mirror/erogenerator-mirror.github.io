There was nothing else to suggest this man was a stranger, but there was an obvious infatuation with this man.</p> <p>"I'm Frank. May I come in?"</p> <p>"No please, I don't know you but I'm just looking for your apartment."</p> <p>The stranger smiled and said "My name is John."</p> <p>"This right here." He pointed and smiled.</p> <p>The stranger led Holly past Frank's apartment. It had a very nice looking living room with a living room table with a picture window, dining room table and a fireplace. Holly could feel the vibes buzzing and she also felt a twinge of jealousy and something else, but she was just too afraid not knowing what was going on.</p> <p>"Well I don't usually come in here, but if you're interested I'd like for you to come into my office and I'll explain what's going on right here." Holly nodded yes.</p> <p>John escorted Holly to a small office that was rather old. The desk was large and it only had one small stool, but there was an old file cabinet on another. The woman behind the desk had very stylishly made up an interview room set up with a desk but a separate room to the right of the door.</p> <p>Frank walked back into the office. "Mr. Phillips, would you please have a seat."</p> <p>John sat down behind the whiteboard. "Mr. Phillips the reason we got a job here at that school was because our teacher gave us the assignment. She asked questions, but I didn't want it to interfere with the college's policies or ethics. If you know what I mean. I'm here with Holly." Frank's face was not very nice.</p> <p>"What do you want from us?"</p> <p>Frank shrugged and replied, "You will just have to guess."</p> <p>John looked at Frank and said, "How do you know you can afford?"</p> <p>Frank looked at Frank for a few seconds and then responded, "We are good to have a good place to work, but we were offered a very generous living stipend and in return they are offering you a full time job. We would offer you a full-time and paid up lifestyle and we would take care of you and your family."</p> <p>"What sort of lifestyle would you like?" Frank asked.</p> <p>John smiled and turned to me and said, "Come with me Holly."</p> <p>As I stood up to follow Frank, Holly looked at my naked body and said, "Oh my, you really are going to fuck your teacher too?" The idea was very sickening.</p> <p>John just grinned and said, "We'll see." His eyes wandered down to Holly's legs and she responded. "Maybe later I can give the student a good report back on his tuition report."</p> <p>John led me into the office where they closed the door and sat me down in one of the chairs so they could have a better view.</p> <p>"I'll start you out the correct way." Holly walked over to John and put her hands on his shoulders and pushed him gently down. He stood up and kissed Holly full on the lips.</p> <p>I kneeled on the seat in front of Frank and Holly. Her eyes were half closed and her hands were on his waist. Frank's hands came down and caressed Holly's cheeks. Her body quivered with excitement and as her kisses became more urgent. Her breasts were large and her bra was not particularly sexy but her nipples were very hard. As Frank pulled her bra strap down her breasts bounced away and I could see that Frank loved Holly's big nipples for their own reasons.</p> <p>John looked at Holly and then at John as he took Frank's shirt off and started to undo his pants. Holly stood up still kneeling and leaned forward. She placed her hands on Ron's bare chest and ran her tongue across his chest. Ron's hands went right to her hair and pulled it back and Holly kissed him lightly on the lips as her hands dropped to his belt and she unbuttoned his pants.</p> <p>Frank stopped for just a second but continued his work on Holly's breasts. John started to unbutton Holly's pants but Holly said, "Stop you Frank."</p> <p>John looked at Holly and replied, "It's your call Holly, come with me." Holly stepped over to Frank and Frank stood. He took Holly's hand and led her to the couch that sat next to the desk. John and I sat on a chair that was a few feet away.</p> <p>Frank looked at Holly and asked, "Don't be nervous."</p> <p>"You should have a more assertive teacher or a more seductive one." Frank leaned over and placed his hand on Holly's head, pushing her mouth down onto his hard cock. As Holly's lips wrapped around the headâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
