He was still working out but today he'd already decided to get his hair done and he still had some of his old graying hair as it went to his shoulders. The rest, I'd decided, was fairly easy. A couple of friends had told me about this and I knew exactly how I felt. The only way to find out the truth was by getting into his pants. I knew he didn't have that huge problem. When he started to put the weights back on, he told me to let him use their bathroom and they gave him the facilities. A couple of nights after meeting with him we took a cab to a bar.</p> <p>As we got back to the table, he handed me the menus of my meal. "How can I help you?" I asked.</p> <p>"Just try this soup," he said. "It just comes with a bit of an unusual flavor, but most of it is good."</p> <p>"You look like your own recipe."</p> <p>"Thank you. I just can't talk about my own recipe with somebody I just met."</p> <p>"Maybe this can open up a bit," he offered.</p> <p>"I'm really sorry if I'm weird or something."</p> <p>"No, it's alright," he assured me. "It's just I need you to talk to me about this after."</p> <p>"I know why you're here. I think I need your help."</p> <p>"What's it to you?"</p> <p>"Look, I'm not telling you the story because I doubt you will believe it. I feel like my only way to avoid talking to you about something is to get it out of my system. Can I make it up to you?" He knew how I felt about this.</p> <p>"Thank you but I don't know how to..."</p> <p>"Let's just get the point across, okay?" He cut me off and I looked at him for the first time since we met. He was still sitting at the table with his back to me, making it impossible to see him. It also didn't help that he was clearly hiding his growing erection, and the whole situation seemed to appeal to me.</p> <p>"But that's why you brought me here," I told him. "I didn't want you to find me at the hospital."</p> <p>"I just wanted to introduce myself and ask your opinion, that way I don't think you'll get mad enough at me for trying to break up an entire friendship. You can tell me anything you like."</p> <p>"Okay," I offered, unsure how to go about the offer.</p> <p>"Okay?" I smiled. "Come on in. I'm going to try to get this out."</p> <p>I watched him walk up the short run of his two half-inch-high heels across the floor, and I heard him chuckle as he said them. His jeans were tight, and it was obvious he wasn't wearing any underwear. As the jacket came off and he bent over to reach into the back pocket of a suit jacket, there was no doubt in my mind he was wearing no underwear. He leaned back and I felt my eyes widen to the brim as I heard him say, "Wow!"</p> <p>"You like?" I asked.</p> <p>"It's a long story. You'll like it."</p> <p>I followed him into the back room, and I saw him slip down the door to what had to be the private bathroom. I walked in and took a seat before I felt him walk in from the other side. He was wearing only his socks, and his shoes were the next ones. He looked down on us, and I found this to be one of the most beautiful things I'd ever seen. I couldn't believe I was seeing two people like this. After a few seconds he pulled his hand away from me and walked up to me. We sat on the large, comfortable leather couch. As I stared into his eyes, I reached out and took his hand in mine. It was unlike any situation I could imagine. It was soft and warm. I looked up at him and we kissed. Our mouths were opened and our tongues were exploring, as if we knew each other well enough to do that. I felt my hands reaching up to his shoulders. We stood staring into each others eyes as our hands stroked and caressed each other. I looked up into his eyes as he pulled me up toward him. When he put my hand on his waist, I felt the fabric of the suit jacket go completely slack at my touch. In a way, the jacket felt like a silk robe while at the same time it felt as though we were only skin and blood touching. It felt like it didn't matter if we were naked in the middle of the room while we stroked each other. I had to have him, as I felt my desire to have him all over myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
