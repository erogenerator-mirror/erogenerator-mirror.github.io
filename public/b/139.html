Alright! I'm ready! I'm in!"</p> <p>They were standing a step or so back from me as we all sat down again. I glanced back over my shoulder as I was about to sit down next to Heather. She was right behind me, but I was facing away from me.</p> <p>"Wow - look at this."</p> <p>I'm sure my face must've registered a smile. I could see her arms from up on her forearms, looking down towards me. I could see the look of a smile on her face as she looked down at the bed in front of her. I couldn't believe this was happening!</p> <p>"That was amazing!" she said.</p> <p>"Really! I thought he was going to come along at any second."</p> <p>"Nope. He wasn't. Actually, he was getting on me for a bit right in front of you."</p> <p>She took hold of my hand and took my hand, pulling me towards her. She was just a little shorter than me, but she was right in front of me. I thought I might drop the camera off if I leaned over, but just as I stepped up, she stepped up behind me.</p> <p>"That's ok," she said with a nod.</p> <p>"Well, I didn't want to just get off just then. I want some more action from you."</p> <p>"Oh, I love it when you talk dirty. Can you do that again?"</p> <p>"Sure," she said.</p> <p>"OK!"</p> <p>She leaned down and kissed me on the neck, and my lips. We remained there for a while as she slowly turned me around so that my back was facing her. She moved around behind me, so that I couldn't really go anywhere, and started kissing the side of my neck and then to the front. When she started kissing my shoulder back over to the other shoulder, her hands were roaming over my torso. I could feel her nipples starting to brush against my back and arms as we continued to kiss. She moved her hands up to my neck just before she moved them around to my chest and started to softly rub my skin and boobs.</p> <p>She started kissing and licking my tits a little bit as well. Her tongue worked its way down from my collarbone to my breast and the end of my nipple which was protruding. She was sucking on it slightly as she did so, and she knew I was liking it. She took one of my nipples in her teeth and began to chew on it, just the way she would with my neck, before going back to the other one.</p> <p>"Do you like that?" she asked as she moved down my torso. "Because I think you do."</p> <p>"Oh fuck - here we go!"</p> <p>She moved down my body and began kissing and licking everywhere she could reach. I could even feel her tongue run back and forth over my clit as they kissed. A couple inches from the end of my pussy did, she ran her hands up and down my thighs as if trying to keep them open.</p> <p>"Let's try something else," she said just before she began to lick my clit. I'm not a porn star, but I know that you've probably thought about doing that a hundred times and you probably have thought about it enough to enjoy every second or two of it. Now, do you, Alex?" she asked.</p> <p>"God, yes! Make me cum for you."</p> <p>"All right. We will. I said we will, but I want to save that for later."</p> <p>"What do you mean? You're sure going to save it for later tonight?"</p> <p>"Of course I want it, and in the mean time, we will be good and we will be good just like now."</p> <p>She stopped what she was doing with her tongue and stood up and started to walk over to the stereo.</p> <p>"Why should you save that, Alex? There are plenty more on that set on the shelf where you want to put the remote." She stood back up and then began to circle the room around it. "Do you think you'll fit around here? You look so much bigger."</p> <p>"If I had two feet on an airplane, I'd fit around here, but with an even smaller window, it would be easier to get around on."</p> <p>"Good for you. It would be a total disaster to get around on when you are getting closer to us."</p> <p>"But I don't see you wasting away!"</p> <p>"It's not so hard, Alex, you just have to do what you've got and then wait until we get to you."</p> <p>"Ok."</p> <p>She walked over to the stereo, pulled something out and then said into the microphone box of the stereo: "Ok! I'm coming down now!"</p> <p>She opened the box, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
