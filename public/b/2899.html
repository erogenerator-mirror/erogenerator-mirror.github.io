You just stood there and watched me. My hand crept to your hip and pulled you closer until my hand was cupping your ass cheek.</p> <p>My fingertips began gently squeezing it and you shivered against me. Your breathing quickened as I slid the tip of one finger inside of you. You tensed up. I slid a finger just an inch at a time, causing you to cry out into my shoulder. Your mouth was on mine again. My tongue slid against the back of your teeth, causing you to moan.</p> <p>I slid one finger in the middle of your opening, then my whole hand, then I slipped them both right in. Your moans turned to moans, your hips began thrusting and your legs began squeezing around my own while my whole hand was buried deep inside of you. You came. The sensation sent your entire body on sexual paroxysms and it sent my heart pounding, too. I couldn't tell if it was pleasure at the feeling of your juices flowing from your pussy and against my hand.</p> <p>Before you knew it, your legs went slack and you collapsed onto the floor. You looked at me, trying to find the words, trying to understand what just happened. You sat there on your knees and realized that what just happened was very wrong.</p> <p>"What was all that about?" You had the sudden question.</p> <p>I chuckled, my face was flushed and I had the tiniest of red cheeks. "It's okay." I told you. "You did this." I grabbed your hand and helped you to sit up. You looked at me with pleading eyes. I was confused by your look, but before I could go any further you had rolled onto your back and put your arm around me.</p> <p>You looked at me, and I saw you looking at me. I pulled you closer and kissed you tenderly. "I'm sorry." I said.</p> <p>"It's okay, I understand." You replied.</p> <p>You leaned in and kissed your way down my body and started to gently play with my nipples. I let you caress them, just enjoying the feel of them in your soft touch. Your tongue slowly traveled down my throat and began to circle it in small circles while your hands traveled over my body. Your lips reached my breasts and brushed lightly against them as your tongue teased and licked my nipple. Your fingers circled my nipple and began to tweak it and you flicked it with a finger while you sucked and took it deeply into your mouth.</p> <p>I moaned quietly, the feel of your body against me was exciting and I wrapped my arms around you. "Touch me there." I whispered in your ear.</p> <p>You ran your fingers lightly over my stomach and along my labia before dipping the tip of your finger inside of me. "Yes." You said. "I'm ready."</p> <p>I slid out of the couch and knelt in front of you. You were not wearing anything underneath and I slid my tongue in between your lips and into your mouth. I licked your soft lips and then slowly slid my tongue into your body again. I continued to kiss you, softly nibbling your lip and nibbling the part of your mouth I had just been kissing. You were responding and it took me a bit to get over the sudden urge to take your breasts in my mouth and suck on them for you. I let my tongue wander down your stomach and you closed your eyes in pleasure.</p> <p>I took my tongue and slid it lower until it touched your lips. "Can I?" I asked.</p> <p>You nodded enthusiastically and let your lips part. I slid the tip of my tongue inside of your body and you gasped in surprised. You tasted so good, the smell, taste as well. I continued to lick your lips and then slide it back to your body. Your lips were slightly parted and your eyes fluttered with passion.</p> <p>Your tongue ran along the curve of my tongue and before I slid it down a bit I felt your hand slip between us, cup my crotch. "You can do that." I told you. Your hand found my wet folds and you spread them slightly, exposing me. You began to caress my labia, tracing them with your fingers while your mouth continued to do erotic things to my pussy.</p> <p>After a while I broke off your oral and crawled up onto my hands and knees. "Is this what you want?," I asked. You nodded your head and I crawled onto the couch, straddling your body and lowering myself onto your waiting tongue. As you began to lap up my juices I leaned back onto the couch as I leaned forward so I straddled your mouth. Your tongue began to work on me, lapping up my juices until you got what felt like an eternity of the best pussy licking I had ever received.
