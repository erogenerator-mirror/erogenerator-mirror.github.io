My own father could do that, too, if he wanted to but not my father. He kept telling me my mother didn't want that, and so my mom kept trying to force it but she just couldn't get rid of it. I was the first generation in my own family and it wouldn't let me out of the house. Dad had already had to get himself a vasectomy when Mom died of cancer but, when Mom had her daughter back she had told him she wanted to have a son. I was the same, but only for a year. As soon as she was off I would find someone else and, when I graduated and went to college it was a good choice. I never really let it bother me.</p> <p>The time came a couple months later when father got a little upset that I was there with him again while I was at Mom's and we stopped at one of the other places I didn't know we were going that night. I was just doing my parents' laundry while he talked with me, and I was going to ask when he was going to talk with Mary again because mom and I would have to make the reservations again. I figured I could sneak that weekend between my folks and maybe I could convince dad to let me.</p> <p>It turned out that Mary lived alone and was out with mother on Saturday and would go with him the next week. That left me free the next month and I would have to stay late for school to get my grades up. But I was already looking forward to it because, well, Mary was doing an awful lot of thinking about it and just wanted me to stay with her. That helped me to get my grades up but had left me nervous. I couldn't just say the 'good boy' all I had to do after Mom and Dad showed up or he and Mary would be done with school and maybe go have sex.</p> <p>I wasn't really sure, of course, but it got me ready to go out and have sex with Mary again, and it did that just in time for that weekend I had. I knew what I was looking at but it really didn't mean anything. So I came straight back to my own life. Of course, the night it was my dad was gone I had decided to go for a walk along the beach. So I wandered off along the beach until I found myself a bench on the beach and sat down. I put my hand down and slid my hand up and down the length of each leg. I thought 'My dad's hand is not as long as my mom had been growing her legs.</p> <p>After a minute or more of this, I stood up and started walking again. I couldn't believe how beautiful it was being nude and feeling just like when I was a child, the feeling of total freedom with no worries about the world or anything at all. That's what made me feel so good. I didn't really know if I could do that or not. Maybe it was because of the fact that it was the right thing to do, but it happened. If I got into Mary's room then it was mine, or I would at least make the connection when she told me my dad had taken me over the top. And I just might make it.</p> <p>By the time I was over my dad had pulled into his garage and was heading back to work. I had no idea what he wanted and wanted, but I didn't have to do anything if I wanted to do that. He didn't want me to go. I didn't know what was right or what to say or what to do. I just wanted to go do it with him. I wanted that to be the end of it. It wasn't just that I wanted that. It was just that the thought of just trying and maybe if I just wanted I could just go home for a night.</p> <p>I stopped and stood up after awhile and walked down the beach. I saw Mary, who I had just walked up to but couldn't even remember where she was. She was standing in front of the beach with a towel around her waist and a very nice looking bikini. "Hi, Mom said. Didn't I say hello?" she asked.</p> <p>I just laughed. "I guess you did but you sure are young. Why don't you come up for a while, sweetheart." And she came over and hugged me.</p> <p>"Are you ready for a new life yet? Are you ready for a new family this time around?" Then she broke out into a wide smile. "Oh, I am ready. Why don't you come and sit by the fire here and get some more sun."</p> <p>Mary was right and I sat by the fire. She lit candles and looked over at me. "Dad is always asking if I have time off so I'm sure you do." and she sat down next to me.
