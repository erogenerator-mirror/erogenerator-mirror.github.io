"I'm not usually."</p> <p>"So I'd say you need a good stout."</p> <p>"Maybe," I said. "But if I make you happy."</p> <p>I wasn't sure what I meant by that last little thing. "I don't usually drink to get laid," she said. "What if I put something on?" I felt my face flush. "What if I want to?"</p> <p>"Then why don't you do it for me, baby?" I said. "I was thinking you had to let me give you a hand in the bar."</p> <p>"I'm not really much of a drinker," she said. "I just enjoy myself."</p> <p>"No, you're not," I said. Then I felt her hand slide along the top of my pants, which had grown tighter around her arm. I could feel my cock, which had begun to stiffen quickly. "I've never tried anything with someone as pretty as you."</p> <p>"You're pretty good, baby," she said. "I like being with you." She lowered her head so she could take my dick in her hand and begin to stroke it. "I want to make you happy," she said. "Do you want to do that?"</p> <p>"Oh," I said, as her hand slipped over the end of my dick, to my pubic hair and down to my balls. I moaned when she began to run her forefinger up and down my balls. Then her hand started to slide down to the base of my dick, and I was sure I was about to come right there. But she stopped, leaned closer, and gave a lascivious whisper. "No," she said. "I want to hear you say it." She leaned forward, and with both hands she wrapped her warm lips around the head of my cock, and began to lower her head back onto my shaft. I held the door open for her, as well as for her tits, and let her work her expert mouth on me. After half a minute of her amazing blow job, I felt her tongue lapping at my cock and the tip of my cock. Then she pulled her head back. "I want you to fuck them," she said, all of a sudden.</p> <p>"I don't know if I will," I said. "I don't have the money to go with," I replied. Just then we heard someone coming down the hall, and from the sound of the key in the door, it was only a moment before it was closing.</p> <p>The next day was Sunday, and I was on my way to the club that night. I got the tickets, and took my time. I did not want to leave her there with a hard-on all the way. I didn't want to cause any problems, and I knew that if I did get her in bed, she would go home. I made the most of it, and was out on the dance floor getting a few glances at her. She had her back to me, and looked over her shoulder as if to say "let me catch up" as she twirled a long red dildo in front of me. I noticed that she was rubbing her clit between her fingers, and that made her pussy drool. So, I walked with my arm around her and my arm around her waist. She was pushing the dildo against herself, but she didn't see me. One of her hands was on the dildo, and she was spreading it apart, revealing her pink vagina. I leaned close to her, and when I pushed my dick straight up against her face, she gave a loud grunt, got up, and pushed the dildo away from her. She turned to face me, put both hands on the front of her face, and then turned back to me. "Are you sure that wasn't too much of a problem?" she said.</p> <p>"No, no, not at all," I said. "We're both consenting adults."</p> <p>"Oh yeah, right. You know, I'm sure I would just say no," she said. Then she lifted her face to mine, and our cheeks pressed together. She looked right in to my eyes, and then took a deep breath. She lifted her head back up to me, and I kissed her. I put my hand on her butt and pulled my cock, but she pulled away.</p> <p>"I want you to do me a little bit," she said. "You do know what a woman wants from a man," she said. "Do you want to taste my pussy?"</p> <p>"Of course," I said. "But if you don't want to do that," I paused. "No, no," I said. "You don't have to do that."
