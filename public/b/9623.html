She stood and slowly went to walk to the kitchen. "Come in, come in." She closed the door behind her.</p> <p>She closed her bedroom door, stepped back, and grabbed her robe. She wrapped it loosely and slowly walked over to the window. A storm wind had started to roll in and she didn't expect it to be so intense.</p> <p>A large shadow blocked her view and she looked up. Two men stood by the bed. Standing behind them was Marcus. He wore a black suit. His suit accentuated his muscular build. Each step brought him closer. "We came to see where you were going tonight," he said. His voice was thick with anger when he spoke.</p> <p>"Why are you here, Marcus?" she asked. She glanced inside the closed door. Both men stood just inside the room.</p> <p>"We're here to meet an acquaintance," said Marcus. He took off his jacket and shirt. In his hands he had a small gun. "You saw her body. Now you need to do the same."</p> <p>Her mind raced. The last thing she wanted to do was meet somebody she could trust and have sex with. But at the same time, they were about the same age, so it scared her. "I told you," she said.</p> <p>The two men walked up to her. Marcus wrapped his arms around her waist and pulled her against him. Her breath was stifling. He put his arms around her and took a hold of her breast and began toying with her nipple. "Let's go," he said. "They want you all to yourselves," he added.</p> <p>The two men led her to another room where the bed was huge. "This is where you will sleep tonight." The two stood by the bed and took off their clothes. They quickly and confidently maneuvered her to the bed. "Undress her," he said.</p> <p>She unbuttoned a few buttons from her sweater. She was still in her bra and her firm tits pushed out against the thin fabric. The men watched hungrily as she removed her bra and panties.</p> <p>The bra came off easily and without a bit of support. Her tits were easily large enough to take the weight but still have to be held up with something tight. The nipples were small but stood perked up like a pencil pointing out from the round globes. With their large breasts, they didn't show as much as they did before. As she pulled down her skirt, gravity pulled it over her hips. After tossing it carelessly into the corner with all her clothes, he walked up to her and took her hand. He led her to the bed. "Lie down," he demanded.</p> <p>She was still a little frightened and excited and didn't know what to expect. "Why are you here, Marcus?" she asked hesitantly. "It's not a hotel. You came here to sleep with us. We won't do anything you don't want to happen," he said. He had an evil smile on his face as he held her hands up. "I'm not letting you go, Sarah. Not tonight." He moved closer to her and put his hand on her face. "We have nothing to do with you," he whispered as his hand traced a line down to her nipple.</p> <p>Her nipples stiffened. "We won't touch you," she said.</p> <p>They began by sucking on her tits. She laid back on her bed without a thought. Her body was tingling but she didn't want to cum unless she could make her tits ache. The men moved to her thighs and legs and pulled them apart. The men moved between her legs and ran their hands up and down her legs. She shuddered at the touch of their fingers. She could smell the scent of sex. He was kissing her stomach and working his way slowly down it. She knew he could smell her excitement in her thighs and she knew he had to. He bent and kissed her stomach and lips. Her body began to tremble. He moved lower until his tongue was gently caressing her clit. Her mouth opened and the taste of herself on his tongue. His tongue pushed into her as his hands pulled her closer against his mouth and tongue. He continued this position for a long time. She felt his hard cock pressing against her pussy and his hot breath on her pussy as his mouth worked over her pussy.</p> <p>He pulled his tongue out of her pussy and moved his lips back to her nipple. His hands took hold of the top of her thighs and he spread them apart. His tongue pushed into her pussy and licked her clit, back and forth. His fingers moved inside her pussy, slowly and gently at first. Then he started pushing deeper into her. He slid his large cock into her as his tongue worked her clit.
