Her mother's face was red with tears, but she wasn't crying anymore in shock.</p> <p>"It's ok to cry now. Just let it out. Don't worry. Here," she said as she took out a tissue, "Here, let me."</p> <p>Sandra laid her head on her daughter's shoulder, and wrapped her arm around her.</p> <p>"I know, sweetie."</p> <p>Sandra closed her eyes tightly and tried to force her emotions out. It was the first hug she'd had since she'd arrived in New York. The last few days had been a whirlwind of excitement. But she was still surprised and embarrassed by what she had seen.</p> <p>It was a very soft and caring and appreciative hug. Not to mention a very wet one.</p> <p>Sandra felt her chest constrict slightly and let out a tiny sob.</p> <p>"Honey, I'm sorry. It's just that you're not doing anything with me."</p> <p>"You've never been on your own. You see..." She shrugged, "I don't have the time, or the energy, for it."</p> <p>"I know, baby. That's what I've always been afraid I'd have."</p> <p>Sandra was silent for what seemed like forever.</p> <p>Even though their relationship had been platonic and intimate, she was still embarrassed by what she had seen. It was very difficult to tell where her feelings stemmed from. She didn't know how to bring up what had happened, the way she felt about her mother. She decided not to tell Sandra.</p> <p>The next thing that happened was different. Just before they both fell on top of one another, Sandra's mind seemed to drift to something that really scared her.</p> <p>It was something new, just as much a turn on as any she'd ever felt before. She felt the warmth of Sandra's body, and the softness of her breasts against her. Her body responded to the new embrace and the feel of her daughter's firm breasts pressing against her.</p> <p>And then as she lay there helplessly in Sandra's arms, Sandra began to think about the night of wild orgasms, that had come from their mother being the first man to fuck her.</p> <p>It was all too much.</p> <p>But the worst part was that her heart felt so light that she had to be comforted. She had come so deeply into their lives. That part of her that was always reserved and submissive for her children.</p> <p>Sandra had no idea what it felt like for her mother to have an orgasm. Or was what it felt like for her to do it, to receive it.</p> <p>Even as Sandra's memories and her experience came back to her, it was as if something had changed in her.</p> <p>"Yes, it's me... in my life." Sandra whispered softly.</p> <p>Sandra had been surprised by her mother's confession. She never really knew what to make of the idea, but it seemed to be right at the root of her life. It made her happy that Sandra felt the same way about her. That was the first time she'd been able to understand her life's issues better. That seemed to help relieve Sandra's loneliness. It made her feel stronger.</p> <p>It helped her to understand her mother more clearly. Sandra had to admit, she didn't regret what happened to her after her orgasm. In fact, her mother could have cared less that she ended up with a dick inside of her. She couldn't think of anything worse than what she had felt about herself.</p> <p>In fact, for Sandra, it felt right to feel as if she was still young, that had taken a sexual toll on her. And that, as she lay there, that was one of the reasons she was being concerned. But she also could see that her own sexuality was still young. She really didn't need to worry.</p> <p>She knew now that she needed to live with her mother. It was just as well that she wasn't around when she came home, so when she got home, she was prepared.</p> <p>"Sandra is here."</p> <p>But she was still in shock.</p> <p>"Mom?"</p> <p>"Yes, sweetie, she's here."</p> <p>"I... I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it."</p> <p>"Sorry is a polite word."</p> <p>Sandra's eyes widened and she could feel the anger in her own voice seeping out. She hated that her own feelings were so strong and negative. But she also knew that if she ever said anything, she was a damn fool. She had felt like that during her mother's last visit, and she'd felt ashamed and ashamed and she had never felt this way about her daughter before.</p> <p>Just as she had been feeling for so long, the feelings were not just mutual.</p> <p>She pulled her mother tightly againstâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
