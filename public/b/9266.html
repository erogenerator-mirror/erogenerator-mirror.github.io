I can't believe I got a boyfriend. I had sex with guys before. It felt good, but I can't go to college again, and it's a lot to take back and not be the same little girl I was."</p> <p>Now I know what that's like to hear someone like that. That's sad. When your heart is broken, it's just a part of yourself. When you had so much to lose, just a little love and hope, what's the difference between that little piece of you?</p> <p>"Do you want to go to college?" I asked as I looked into her eyes and was surprised once again. "No. Not really."</p> <p>My words were as honest as I could make them. "I guess you can't do it. We've gotten married and you still need a man. I'm not a virgin, and I wasn't sure if you meant it."</p> <p>She looked shocked. "If you really mean what you say, I guess I can't go to college, but I'll make some friends."</p> <p>"Yeah, and make some guys good-looking, and they'll make good-looking women happy, too, so you don't have to worry about it."</p> <p>We got some more coffee and enjoyed them, as some of the tension eased. Just as I was putting the cup to your lips, she looked over at me and said, "I hope we can find a way to do this."</p> <p>At that point, my eyes were tearing up, and so was hers. I told her I wanted to see her in her dress.</p> <p>After a pause, she said, "I guess I owe you one."</p> <p>We spent the rest of the day together, and she went home to get her things. The next day we got a hotel room to call and set up a meeting. We met for dinner that night and had a laugh over the conversation about work, and then I had to go to work. The rest of the time was pretty normal. I was just as happy to be back at work, and she was going to have a nice vacation. That night, she asked to stop by my place. At the end of her shift, she said, "I think it's time we let things cool down a little."</p> <p>"Not so fast, sweetheart. I'm going to make a deal with you. We can start an argument and then we can finish up together, and we can stay together until we graduate, whatever you want to do together. We can even get a job at the local college to work on our courses."</p> <p>I didn't hesitate. "OK. If you want to get me out of it, why don't you join me. We can work on my courses together when we can."</p> <p>She was thrilled. "No, that's great! I'm going to go back to being a little girl. I'm still learning this new sex thing."</p> <p>I said, "I know what it means. You'll have to see exactly what it is you think I'm talking about. So, what can we do now to get it over?"</p> <p>We spent the next several hours in various conversations.</p> <p>At first we just talked about how things were between us, but then she said, "I can't believe I just did that," and then started telling me about her and how wonderful it could be.</p> <p>I told her I felt the same way, but that when she had her first experience, she should make sure to remember how she did that. I made her feel as happy as I'd ever felt. I also told her it would be a great idea to bring a friend or a friend, so my next best-in-the-toke was going to be her.</p> <p>She told me that she might bring a couple friends, but no plans. She just felt like she needed a few new experiences to come out of. If there was a chance that those things might work out, I'd be glad to oblige.</p> <p>One evening when she was getting ready for bed, she asked me what I felt about the night she'd had.</p> <p>"It was just as it should be. If that's what you mean, you'll be able to tell what I felt."</p> <p>When I looked at her as she was getting ready for bed, she was looking at me differentlyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
