His hands moved up to meet hers.</p> <p>"Are you okay, sweetie, you're still a bit cold, are we coming up too soon?" she asked.</p> <p>"No, it's just sort of warm. Thanks for doing the warm up for me!"</p> <p>"Okay, come on in. Let's warm up," Sally said as she pulled him to the doorway to the house and let him enter the house.</p> <p>Sally led him to the kitchen and began heating up a pan of vegetable beef soup for lunch. She put soup in a bowl to wash down the warm soup and then asked Sally to help her out of her clothes. She stood in front of him in all her naked glory and kissed him, first taking one of his nipples between her fingers, then the other. Her mouth parted, and her tongue reached to his and they began to kiss deeply as she removed his robe.</p> <p>As they broke the kiss, Sally said, "Oh, sorry sweetie, my mouth feels dry to me!" The warm water from the water trickling from the glass on her desk and running around the drain.</p> <p>He looked at her, "You okay honey?"</p> <p>Just as she was beginning to feel better, she felt his hands exploring her bare body as they walked toward the living room, down the hallway and into their bedroom. As they lay naked in bed, she ran her hands down his chest, over his stomach and then down to his cock. He wasn't as big as he had been and she was surprised at the fact that he was thicker. As she stroked his cock, she wondered how he'd ever been. He was standing at the end of the bed, just looking at her as he stroked himself. It was as if he were thinking about her. His face, chest and shoulders were all flushed from their sex and he had a look on his face that she had never seen in him. It made her feel so sexy. Her own cock was hard again and the thought that he was thinking about that big beautiful cock gave her pussy a tingle. She could feel the blood rush into her cock head, it was starting to get big, but her thoughts were focused elsewhere anyway.</p> <p>Sally began running her hands up and down his thick, veiny shaft as they lay snuggled together. He turned onto his side, facing her, as he stroked his hand up and down her naked body. His hands moved from her hips to her round breasts, pinching each of her nipples between her thumb and index finger. She gasped quietly at his touch, his soft caresses.</p> <p>"It's been many months now and I feel very different now, it's just unbelievable that I'm still horny as hell! You're right, I didn't think your beautiful cock would feel as good!"</p> <p>"Do you want it, sweetie? Do you want cock in you?" Sally said with a smile. Sally pulled him toward her. She placed her lips on his, their tongues moving in and out of each others mouth. This was what she liked about him, he seemed to know his own body, so he knew what to do. He pressed his lips against hers. His tongue touched hers and began moving with her own as their mouths moved together. Finally, Sally moved to the center of the bed, sitting down next to him, as their hands ran all over each other's naked bodies.</p> <p>They moved down toward the sheets, kissing their way to their sides and around their mouths, touching their hair as they went. Suddenly, they both stopped short, both gasping.</p> <p>Sally smiled up at him, "Oh, I don't understand."</p> <p>He smiled back at her, "I thought we might have been going longer than we had planned. We really hadn't planned it at all!"</p> <p>"No," she said, "and I didn't plan either, when we were still in the woods." And she kissed him softly, "Oh, I'm sorry!"</p> <p>"It's okay," he said, with a smirk.</p> <p>"What's that?" she asked, still smiling.</p> <p>"We've been fucking like rabbits for weeks," he said.</p> <p>Sally looked at him, then at her breasts. "You're sure it's okay, honey? Really? I'm worried."</p> <p>"Yes," he said, putting his arms around herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
