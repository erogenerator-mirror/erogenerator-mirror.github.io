My hand was on her stomach, running my fingers over her body, feeling her skin all the way down her waist. I slowly slid my finger down the side of her hip, then down the outside of her leg. With outstretched fingers, I moved forward and lightly brushed her panties.</p> <p>"Are you serious?" she whispered.</p> <p>"Deadly." I had to pause to take her tone. I'd barely gotten it right before she asked again, not wanting to take it back. "We've been going at it now for a few hours. I could stay." My eyes never leaving her face, my mouth meeting hers. No, we shouldn't.</p> <p>Tears sprang into her eyes when she realized that she had a new man, one that had taken her virginity. Then just as quickly she had another one of her boyfriend's too.</p> <p>"We shouldn't," she managed, once again.</p> <p>"No," I insisted on taking her by her shoulders and turning us around. "I'm sorry we did that. Please don't hate us." She didn't answer. She pulled herself out of bed and walked to the door. "I'm going to bed now. Don't call me. I'm going to sleep like this forever, and I still don't want to see you."</p> <p>I stared at her as she closed the door. She would never want him. Maybe because it's only for a night. Maybe because she can't go back. I couldn't decide. She wasn't ready for what's right and wrong, but I wanted to have sex with her. I wanted to show her a man who knew exactly how to love her.</p> <p>When I closed my eyes, I saw that I was about to find out. It would always be a memory of her, a memory from a life that had only been few moments ago. It would always be of me and she together. That I had the opportunity to see her in all her beauty, to have her come to my bed so that I could make love to her.</p> <p>I reached my hand over her shoulder to my shoulder. I pulled her back against my chest and nuzzled her hair. We kissed, it felt as good as it always did. Our tongues danced between ourselves, fighting to keep contact as soon as possible. My heart pounded in my chest as we broke off.</p> <p>"You're going to do it to me," she breathed, sounding like a puppy in need. She pushed me gently to the bed and I sat back down, my hands gently slipping over her shoulders.</p> <p>"It's just like I'm thinking," I told her.</p> <p>"We are going to have a fantastic relationship, and I want you for my son." I saw her cheeks flush, her hand on her waist as she stood up.</p> <p>"Well, if you think I'm just going to call you," I shot out, still trying to convince myself to just take it slow. Then, when it looked like this wasn't going to happen, I added, "I don't take it to the next level with you. I don't even take a hint from you. I already have."</p> <p>"This isn't just for the first day. It's for the rest of our lives," she admitted. "If you want to, we can keep going."</p> <p>"That would be nice," I assured her.</p> <p>"But not here," she said. "We could never go back there." She held out a little hand to shake with one arm. She didn't even bother to put on the nightgown that I'd worn the day before. Instead she just took out her cell phone and turned on the camera.</p> <p>I'm not that kind of boy. I can still remember the day that we all went to the park on a cloudy day to meet for lunch. At some point I remember having a picnic basket, getting some fresh flowers and a blanket for the afternoon. We'd all brought our lunch bags with us, but had never gone further into the woods. She had me put on a top hat and blanket, which she quickly covered up with one of the shirts we had brought. On the first day we'd done more than that, I'd let her put on a t-shirt. Now she used the one we had to ride the bikes outside. Of course, she didn't seem to mind it.</p> <p>We'd all gathered around the tree I'd set up for her in the middle of the forest, getting into the hot tub, and making hot steamy love. She was still shy around me, and just a bit distant with every little thing we discussed. She would probably take my hand, but I was feeling a little uncomfortable. She always said I should try and forget that she really liked me and cared about me, but she had neverâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
