"I love you." When I heard his name, I felt like I was melting. My head was spinning. It had happened quickly, so quickly I was surprised. It took me a few moments to realize what had happened before I had thought it was going to leave me feeling like a complete and utter zombie of my childhood. But then I realized it was really happening to me. That same familiar stirring in my pelvis where my clitoris had been gently tapping against the sheets. And then I felt it. It was making waves as my body shuddered with my orgasm. I had thought I may be a lesbian, and I couldn't help it. The more I thought about it, the more I realized I wanted it. I wanted my sister, to know I wanted the same thing as her. To know that she was in my bed.</p> <p>I don't know how long our kiss lasted. But eventually we found that we couldn't stay in our separate worlds forever. He pulled his mouth away from mine briefly, then looked into my eyes, which had gone deep and dream blue in passion.</p> <p>"You're beautiful." His voice was warm not angry but full of caring. "Come on. Let's go to bed."</p> <p>In a trance, I quickly dressed in my school uniform. In a weird twist, I found myself a pair of short, thin pink sneakers on. I grabbed a pair of thin, white socks and then dashed out to the bathroom to get my makeup. I went back to my room and collapsed on the bed with my new pink sneakers.</p> <p>After about a minute, I decided that I better stay in the warm, cozy bed. I got up and sat next to my old friend.</p> <p>"I'm not going to sleep here tonight if it's not what you really want," he said. "So I just want to be with you."</p> <p>I nodded, unable to talk.</p> <p>"Me too," I murmured. "I don't think I'm ready to move on."</p> <p>"Me either," He replied. "No matter how long we keep this up we'll always be one of us."</p> <p>I felt like we were in a kind of hug. Our warmth was palpable. Our skin touched and our skin touched. The smell of each other. How intimate that felt. I don't know why my mind was trying to figure out all the angles that we were going to fit in. But, eventually I decided to tell him what had happened.</p> <p>"I mean, I'm sorry to think that things aren't going to work out between us this year," I said. "But if there's anything else . ."</p> <p>"Well," he interrupted me. "It doesn't seem like either one of us can make ourselves feel like that again. I can't exactly blame us," he said. "We need to get out of that bed. It's not going to be good."</p> <p>"I don't know about that, too?" I asked. "I was so scared at the start but I wasn't sure that it would fit in the same way."</p> <p>"Well, just stay there," I heard him say. "It's okay."</p> <p>"You're right," I agreed but I couldn't help but feel like I really was going to argue this one over and over again. When we had to separate, I knew it had to be this way.</p> <p>"It's really important to you that I get what I wanted," he said without hesitation. "I want you to have what you deserve."</p> <p>"I don't know what I want," I said. "But it's hard to have this all to myself anymore."</p> <p>"I know," He said. "But if you can feel what you want, it gets better. And sometimes in your sleep, it gets better."</p> <p>"Do you know anything about this?" I asked.</p> <p>He nodded.</p> <p>"Let's just get to bed," he said. "I'm tired."</p> <p>"Okay," I agreed. "I'm going to wait a little while."</p> <p>When I got to my door, he stood on my porch with his back to me. I stared at him. I felt like I was in a kind of trance. I could feel his heartbeat. His breathing. And his body language. It took me a couple of seconds to place everything. But then the realization hit me. There were two hearts. They were just two people in love. They were in love with each other. It just... it all began with the two. But then... when we were kids...</p> <p>The night that followed I slept fitfully. Not because of the dreams, but because of how I felt. At first I thought of the kids as a friend, but soon realized it was more than that. I felt their love flowing into mineâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
