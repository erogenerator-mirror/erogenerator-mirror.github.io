She then walked back into the living room, dropped her head into her arms and hugged me tight. Her hands were rubbing my back and my ass and she was breathing heavily. When we were finally caught up about how things were going and how to go from there we quickly agreed that we both needed some time to think about what went on in my life.</p> <p>After our discussion Karen had been acting a little strange about her appearance which was getting hard to figure out what the heck she was up to. Her reaction was to put on her own sweats and come out of there in nothing but a thong.</p> <p>"I don't know if I can," she said with a frown.</p> <p>"You're not going to take your thingy off, are you?" I smiled at her and she immediately hugged me tighter.</p> <p>"I guess we're both going to have to take our thingy off, aren't we, Karen?"</p> <p>"I'm already taking my thingy off!" she laughed and laughed again.</p> <p>"You'll have to get the sweats off of me, too!" she said with a smile as she took her sweater off. I pulled out my dick and she took off her sweats as well.</p> <p>"Get out of your panties, too!" she ordered and we both obeyed without a question. When I turned around and bent at the waist to pick up my skirt, she quickly got behind me and put her hand on my ass as she rubbed it.</p> <p>"No you get my panties," Karen said as she rubbed my ass.</p> <p>"But I don't, Karen," I protested.</p> <p>"Just let it happen," she replied.</p> <p>"Let me kiss you!" I demanded.</p> <p>"No, let me do something," she pleaded.</p> <p>She got behind me and slid her hands up my legs and under my panties. She pulled them up into my crotch and then lifted my cheeks. I raised my ass off the couch so she could pull the panties out and they went between my cheeks. She took the panties and then slowly pulled my panties down off of my ass.</p> <p>"Oh honey, that's amazing!" she exclaimed as she looked at my naked pussy and pussy lips looking back at her.</p> <p>"What are you looking at?" I asked, as she took of her shirt and then her sports bra completely off.</p> <p>"Your ass and legs," she said.</p> <p>"That is so sexy," I said. "I love your ass."</p> <p>When I raised my butt as she pulled my panties down enough so that she could pull them down to my knees she put those panties under my butt and then did so again.</p> <p>"What you think?" she asked as she put the panties around my face and she kissed my cheek.</p> <p>"This is so sexy," I said as I looked at her and my face became moist with wanting.</p> <p>"I know what this means," she continued as she kissed again and then my lips. "And we have an eternity to go through, remember?"</p> <p>"I know," I said. "I know. I've got this, too."</p> <p>"How about I get back at you?" she asked. "Would you like to cum?"</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sure I want to cum, Karen, I want you so bad."</p> <p>"OK then", she said as she stood up and stepped towards me and kissed me on the lips.</p> <p>We stood together in front of each other kissing each other for some time and then I led her back to her bedroom. I laid her down and took off her panties as we kissed some more. She spread her legs and I buried my dick in her slit and started to pump in and out of her.</p> <p>"Oh, that's so sexy," she said as she looked down at me and moaned again. "Do that for me, baby," she demanded.</p> <p>I continued pounding in and out of her for about thirty seconds and then began pulling my dick out of her pussy before plunging it back in. We fucked for a while and then I pulled her down and pushed her back against the bed. My dick was out of her as I pulled out again and positioned myself between her legs so I could kiss her.</p> <p>"Oh, honey, this is so good!" she exclaimed as she looked back at me.</p> <p>"It's good for me too," I replied.</p> <p>Karen reached down to find my cock as my lips were kissing her and stroking the head of my dick. She gently squeezed it and I told her to stop.</p> <p>"There's way too much cock!" she argued.</p> <p>"Just fuck me," I offered.</p> <p>She sat up and guided my hard dick into her and we had an immediate mutual orgasm.
