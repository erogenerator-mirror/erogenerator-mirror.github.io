I say calmly, as I watch you begin to blush. I run my tongue around my lower lip, making you shudder. I place one hand on the back of your neck and gently push you forward till your face is pressed into the fabric of the box. You can feel the soft silk of your dress brushing against your cheeks as you part them to me. You lift your lips slightly to allow me access. I hold my breath, waiting for a reaction. You raise your hands up and cover my eyes, as your fingers dance lightly up my legs. Your touch brings a small moan to your mouth without any words coming out, and I can tell from your grip on my neck that you are enjoying the sensations.</p> <p>I can't take it anymore and I move forward, my cock pressing firmly against your body. There is no way I'm going to let you have any control tonight, not with all of the thoughts that have been racing through my mind... but I need to see how you take this surprise. I slowly drag my finger tips lightly down your neck and across your collar bone. I stop briefly to kiss the tops where your shoulders begin, and again, I make sure no one besides me can see. I watch as you feel the first tingles of embarrassment start at the pit of your stomach, and begin to run up your limbs, slowly as the pleasure build, and then stop. You let your fingers drop to your sides and you let your head turn, trying to pull away from the touch. You have no way of keeping me from wanting to take that opportunity, and in an act I'm not going to be denied either. I slowly run my hand down your left shoulder and across your lower back, stopping near your ass. I slowly run my hand up the other side of your body, stopping to lightly brush your nipples; they respond instantly, and begin to swell. Your left hand tries to pull back from the blindfold, and your eyes try to keep watch on your face, but you don't see and are distracted by the soft tickling feeling of my fingertips dancing across your skin.</p> <p>I bring your hands back up to your breasts and slowly trace the curve of your ribs, my fingertips coming to rest on the tips of your nipples. Slowly, I move them along your body to your nipples, which begin to stand erect; they don't have as much of a reaction to the warmth of my fingers as they do to the cold ones. My palms lightly brush against your breasts, my fingers tracing small circles over the sensitive flesh, sending little shivers through your body. I slowly run my hands down your sides, and as you let your hands fall to your sides I gently wrap my left hand around your right ankle and start to slowly dance a slow figure eight from ankle to ankle. The only music in the room is the soft sound of the surf in the waves, and your breathing quicken slightly. I slowly start to make my way up to your left leg, and take your right leg in my hand, wrapping my fingers around to your knee to begin to caress it ever so slightly. Your fingers begin to run down towards your thighs, and then back up towards your stomach. Your fingers are entwined in my hair as we both continue tracing the curves of leg, while I slowly massage away the tension in your legs.</p> <p>My hand continues to travel up your legs slowly as it slowly caresses your inner thigh. My own breathing begins to quicken slightly, as I know what is waiting to come from the inside of these lips. I lightly run my finger tips across the fabric lightly, and move my head down to your outer lips, and gently lick your moist, hot flesh. I slide my tongue over you, not wanting to touch your hot center with my mouth, knowing you could cum very loud in the midst of the eroticism. I slide my tongue up and down your lips teasingly and with a deliberate rhythm now, as your breathing quickens. I lick your inner lips softly, teasing the inside of your lips and your clit.</p> <p>I taste you, not the tangy sweetness of your essence that I had expected earlier. Your hand grabs at the back of my hair, holding me up to you. You grind your clit into my nose, letting loose a slight moan, and I can feel the heat of your juices coming to the surface. I take your clit into my mouth, taking it fully into my mouth, as you let out a soft gasp, trying to pull your hips up a little. I slowly increase the speed of my tongue, and the intensity of the sensations. You're breathing is quickening, moaning softly into my body with each passing moment. Your clit is being teased to the brink, and as I hear you let out a shudder, I take it into my mouth and gently hold it while running the back of my tongue over it quickly as you go over the edgeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
