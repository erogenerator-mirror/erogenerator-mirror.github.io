I would like one day to stay there until the last moment that is. But if we can manage, I will go home on Saturday."</p> <p>His tone was friendly, but he wasn't in my room.</p> <p>"I'll call up a friend for us, after work, if you like."</p> <p>He was on the telephone when I arrived at the house. I called up my sister who was asleep on the couch nearby. She gave me a hug and asked if I could stay the day. As I came down from the elevator, I saw that it was only 7:30.</p> <p>"So? If I'm up as late as I have been I think I'll be staying overnight. I was hoping to get back earlier than that, in time for the new movie, anyway. I'll take another walk, maybe you are in luck, you're up early."</p> <p>"Good night."</p> <p>"Good night," she replied. We hung up the phone.</p> <p>It was a couple of hours after I was finished, when I walked into her living room. She was curled up with the light of a single bulb above her head, facing away from the window.</p> <p>"Just in time," I said.</p> <p>"Sorry," she apologized.</p> <p>"Hey, hey, I was just thinking about you again."</p> <p>"It's not a big deal, is it?" she asked, surprised that I had made a habit of taking advantage of her before, but it wasn't too bad.</p> <p>"Not really. I was just thinking that it wouldn't be a big deal to keep in touch, because I can't be the one he hangs out with, at least not in the office."</p> <p>"Is he still working here?" she asked.</p> <p>"He'll be in the other room soon," I answered.</p> <p>"I know. I'm so excited."</p> <p>As the evening wore on I started to notice her. She wore something that looked like a pair of jeans or pants, and a loose fitting sleeveless shirt worn low on her neck. She was also wearing a jacket that I had never seen on her. It was also very short, covering a couple of inches lower than my knees, and had a hood over her face and one half of her nose. As the evening wore on, I noticed that despite wearing only those five-inch heels, her face seemed to be almost invisible underneath the hood. Her hair was a light brown that had to have been long or black, hanging about her shoulders and curling under her right hand. She was wearing a pair of large sunglasses. I looked at her to gauge her mood, which she seemed to be in the midst of.</p> <p>"What you do in the afternoon?" I asked, trying to be casual, but obviously hoping for something.</p> <p>"Oh, well, I've heard that the old movie is a lot of fun, but I don't really know what you're looking at," she replied, grinning. She had a pout on her face. "Do you mind if I go back to my place and change, and join you? I could use a nice warm shower. The bathroom is right next to yours."</p> <p>"Yeah, sure," I replied, not having that feeling of a plan coming to fruition that I had already.</p> <p>The rest of the evening was fairly uneventful, so when we got home and I offered to run to the store, she readily accepted, promising to come back around noon. While I was out of the apartment, I thought of her. I saw the hood and the hat and decided to go upstairs a little further, to see if she would like to join me for dinner. I took a shower before she came over, and left the water running. I stripped down to my shorts and slipped into a tee shirt, knowing that she would be waiting for me. She came back down the stairs as I was about to start the grill.</p> <p>"Hey," I said, when she stopped to say hi, "it's so hot in here."</p> <p>"It's ok, I'm only going to go with you for a few minutes."</p> <p>"So, can we go for a swim? I can't see how we can get any wetter than we already are" she asked, looking down at her breasts.</p> <p>"We can do anything that you want if you're cool with it."</p> <p>"Ok," she responded, looking at my shorts and the sight of where they were tucked deep in my crotch. I had a hard on, and my cock was swelling against the material, and her eyes were a bit wide. She didn't say anything, she simply dropped her pants and took off her shirt. She was still standing in front of me in a bra and panties I had never seen before.
