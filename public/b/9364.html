He looked scared.</p> <p>I took my seat, and took my coffee.</p> <p>The girl I had been chatting with when we arrived said, “Where he is taking it, I’ll do the paperwork, get his file.”</p> <p>“Thank you ma’am.”</p> <p>“No problem John, I’m going to go home and get some work done.”</p> <p>“Yes ma’am.”</p> <p>The young man I had spoken with was there. He took his cup, took some papers out of the cupboard and left. The woman who came with the boy was there watching him.</p> <p>“Yes I can see you. Did you see me watching him?”</p> <p>“Yes ma’am, did he?"</p> <p>“Yes he did, do you remember?”</p> <p>I shook my head, but he was too strong.</p> <p>“He’s got a hard-on.” The young woman whispered.</p> <p>She looked at me, then to his hard on, then to the man in front of him.</p> <p>“Excuse me, there’s no need to be embarrassed.”</p> <p>She put her coffee cup on the desk, and said, “My name is Elizabeth. John, how may I help you?”</p> <p>I shook my head, and asked, “Ma’am, I have to take down my records this morning.”</p> <p>“That’s OK, just go with it John. I have something for you.”</p> <p>She leaned in close, so that my cock was right at her cleavage.</p> <p>“John, are you going to be in charge of our account today?”</p> <p>Again, I shook my head.</p> <p>“If I am in charge, I will take care of it. That’s a promise.”</p> <p>“I see...I…I’ll try not to make you hurt, but…I have to do a report.”</p> <p>With that, she leaned closer and let her breast caress the side my face, and then she took her hands and began to massage them in kind of a “caress” motion.</p> <p>“John, this is Elizabeth, Elizabeth, is she your new companion?”</p> <p>“Yes ma’am, are you sure she is your friend?”</p> <p>Her hands were moving more and more against the side of my face, and I could feel my cock harden more and more, in the heat of the moment.</p> <p>“Would you like to join Elizabeth and John? They will probably have a private chat and get to know each other better.”</p> <p>I was in a state.</p> <p>She leaned her head closer to me, to give me a light kiss on the lips.</p> <p>I said, “I'm sorry, but I was trying to do them both.”</p> <p>All I could do was just lay back and enjoy the moment.</p> <p>She got up the papers she was going to take, and came to me. She sat on the edge of the desk, took my left hand and the left middle finger of my right hand, and placed them on the nipples of her right breast, so that my middle and ring fingers were rubbing over them.</p> <p>She said, “John, do you think you can handle two?”</p> <p>As I thought, I shook my head no.</p> <p>She looked at me, her hands were still moving.</p> <p>Then she said, “John, would you do me the same honor, please?</p> <p>She took the cup away, set it on top of my coffee table, and set a note on the table.</p> <p>She took off her bra, and sat back against the desk, her arms folded.</p> <p>I felt like a god, as I slowly took off my own clothes, and finally got naked.</p> <p>Her breast were slightly bigger than mine, and her nipples were hard.</p> <p>I asked, “May I make a note please, ma’am?</p> <p>She said, “It’s alright John, don’t be afraid to look, or even touch.”</p> <p>As I took her breasts in my hands—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
