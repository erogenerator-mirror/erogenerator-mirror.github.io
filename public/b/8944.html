Who the hell do you think you are doing fucking the shit I love doing." She looked right at me as we stood and kissed. I'm pretty good at it. I love it too. I was trying to kiss her face, eyelashes, eyes, etc when her hand pulled at mine.</p> <p>As I stepped away from her I said, "It's okay. This is me and my sweetie."</p> <p>The look she gave me was almost to scared to believe so I stepped back. This time I got behind her and bent down to kiss her again. My kiss had the effect of making her tongue press against my lips, the taste of my own pussy on my own tongue. It was an incredibly erotic moment.</p> <p>I let my tongue play with hers and finally she broke our kiss.</p> <p>"You're making me hot and I need to touch my pussy some."</p> <p>I moved into position, spread her legs as I kneeled and put my face to her pussy and inhaled. I found her opening with my tongue and licked it all along it as if it was a cock.</p> <p>"That's it. Do you like that? Do you like how it feels on your tongue?"</p> <p>Her mouth opened and we kissed as I put two fingers deep within her, pressing and playing with her hard little nub with the thumb of my hand. Her other hand went behind me and caressed my butt cheek.</p> <p>We broke our kiss and I said, "I love it when you talk like that. Your so hot."</p> <p>I lifted my head up a bit, looked into her eyes and said, "I think you have a lovely ass." I turned to face her and said, "You know it is an incredible ass, right?"</p> <p>"I love that it is so fucking cute."</p> <p>"I can't believe that you call it cute as opposed to sexy. You like it don't you?"</p> <p>I sat on the floor between her leg and put it between my thighs as I sat. She looked over at me.</p> <p>"I love it."</p> <p>"What makes it so special?" she asked.</p> <p>"I like the way it fits me. Now do what you do when you eat pussy and do it. Lick my hole."</p> <p>She did and it felt amazing. She was like a real pro. Not just a pussy licker but she also really knew her way around a pussy.</p> <p>"That feels so good."</p> <p>I took my fingers from her pussy and brought them to my nose. She smelled like the pussy she was licking, a mixture of her own pussy juice and my juices.</p> <p>"You are such a good lover."</p> <p>"I like it." She told me. I put four fingers on either side of my mouth and started to use my mouth, tongue, and all around her pussy. She was getting into it and pushing herself back against my mouth and tongue. I couldn't concentrate on anything except the feel of her hot pussy all around my mouth and tongue. I was really into it as her wet hole came to the surface.</p> <p>As she pushed back hard against me, her face became a mask of concentration. Her breath was coming out in quick ragged bursts and her eyes were squeezed tight as her body shook. I looked up at her.</p> <p>"You taste fantastic."</p> <p>"Yes, this feels amazing right now."</p> <p>She had a hold of me. Her hands were gripping my butt and pulling me towards her as she climaxed. It was just one of the most intense experiences of my life. Her grip was so strong I could feel the bones on each hand going up and down her arms, even her fingers in my hair.</p> <p>I didn't release my hold on her. She didn't let them go. I didn't withdraw my hands. I just sat there kissing her as she came down from her high. She pulled me up with her arms and kissed me again.</p> <p>"If you are ever going to fuck again I need to be inside you again."</p> <p>I stood, walked around her to where she knelt and put a condom on her.</p> <p>"I want to make love to you every which way I can."</p> <p>"You are the world's sexiest man."</p> <p>I didn't say that. Instead I kissed her softly. We broke our contact just as my hard cock was aimed at her sopping pussy.</p> <p>"Ready?" I asked.</p> <p>She was looking up at me with a smile.</p> <p>"Can I?"</p> <p>We had both seen the way she looked at me and the kind words she used. I didn't need any moreâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
