What about her." He said, a little sadly. "She'll be OK."</p> <p>"She's OK?" Amy said in a whisper. "She'll be fine. She was only a child..."</p> <p>"I know, I'm just sorry. I can't change that. I just can't."</p> <p>Amy sat up and reached out to caress him. Her arm went around his waist.</p> <p>"Don't be," she said, "I've got you. We can do whatever we want. It seems like it'll be good to love again."</p> <p>He smiled. "I've been thinking a lot about that and I just want to tell you, Amy, we have to figure this out. It's not right to be thinking about getting involved with someone we really love."</p> <p>"I know. I've been thinking about you too. I was so sad when I walked in on you and dad and he was gone."</p> <p>"What did you do?"</p> <p>"I think it was him..."</p> <p>Amy looked a little perplexed. "You can't be certain when I told you that?"</p> <p>"I'm still very much in denial."</p> <p>"So you don't really think I'm really your daughter?"</p> <p>"Of course. You're my sister. That makes me your mother."</p> <p>Amy gave him a look which puzzled him a little, but nothing more than a little shrug. "I don't know about that."</p> <p>"Maybe we should do something."</p> <p>"I don't think..."</p> <p>"I just want to make sure you're OK, Amy," Jack said. "We want to know everything you really want."</p> <p>"OK," she said. She looked at her watch and saw that it was time to get up in front of the two of them. She got hold of her bikini line and peeled it off. She looked down and saw she'd lost all of it completely because of their encounter the night before. She tossed it to him, and took his hand to pull it away.</p> <p>After looking herself over for quite some time, she decided to take care of her hair and put some blonde highlights in. She sat back down in the water, letting the water run off her.</p> <p>"So what are you going to do?" Jack asked.</p> <p>"I'm not sure. I'm just not sure...I should start asking around. I mean..." She trailed off, "Well, I don't know...is it really alright if I let you make love to me with your tongue and..." She looked at him in surprise.</p> <p>"You never made love to me like that? I thought it a sin. That thing was gross."</p> <p>"Oh, it's pretty gross, but I don't mind. I'd love to. Like it?"</p> <p>Jack nodded.</p> <p>"Well, I wouldn't mind if you kissed me then. I'd definitely want to make love to you...just once." Her eyes lit up.</p> <p>Jack smiled, "Then you're all mine."</p> <p>There was a long moment of silence, when both stared at each other and let their breath hang in the water.</p> <p>"Let's get up here, I think."</p> <p>"OK," Amy agreed. "It's only a few."</p> <p>Jack and Amy got up to the side of the pool and wrapped their arms around each other. They sat there, kissing and exploring each other's mouths and necks and breasts and asses, as if they had been doing this all their lives. Their bodies pressed against each other, not wanting to move away, even though the water had made their breasts rub together.</p> <p>Their kisses grew more passionate, more tender, their lust evident. Jack's hands wandered from Amy's breasts down to her pussy, where they felt the lips, which were already wet and engorged, open and waiting, anticipating their touch.</p> <p>Amy's arousal was increasing. It was very clear now how much she and Jack both wanted to feel each other at the same time. They lay in the water with their mouths on each other's necks and chests and backs and buttocks, sucking on each other's nipples and licking the lips and the back of each other's thighs and legs. They both felt their pussies swelling, the heat rising in them, and their cunts pulsing and clutching each other.</p> <p>Jack kissed Amy's throat, and then she moved down to her breast. It wasn't really a breast, but it was nice. His kisses slid over it and down, over her flat stomach, and between her thighs, where they met at the cleft of her vagina. It was pink and wet and inviting.
