Gina lay there panting and I had cum in several gouts of come onto Gina's skin, her arms now wrapped around my back, her head on my shoulder.</p> <p>"Oh my God, what a fuck!" said Gina, "How did I ever get myself into getting the whole thing in?" She was smiling, but my cock would not respond.</p> <p>I said, "Well Gina, I guess I just fucked up."</p> <p>"What do you mean. You fucked up, so to speak. I'm glad it was something that I wasn't going to do, but I can't imagine what would've happened with you if I had. That's an understatement for real. I got an idea if I could figure myself out."</p> <p>I knew what that meant. I mean, if we'd have a discussion about what the next step would be and what I'd do, there would be nothing, absolutely nothing, between us. But no matter how we would discuss it, if Gina had no other motive than to get me off, nothing would happen. I had nothing to gain but the possibility that my feelings for her would go away. But why had it seemed to me in the end that it was going to happen? Because I wasn't getting it in. I thought of this as a very difficult question. I don't know if anyone had ever had sex with me there before. If you had sex in an airplane, where would you land your penis, how would you be with someone else who would have you in a plane that would fly to my world and to the sky?</p> <p>"Now, I'm sure you're getting your whole answer to the question. I feel like you know what we need. We both know what we need. If I get an erection and you get a hard on, I'm out of here as easily as if I had never, ever walked down the aisle at Penn State. No wait, let's take a trip, just take it slow as we do it, let's do it a little slower just to get a feeling of what might happen, as if you were about to take my virginity. No problem, but be careful. Is there ever any chance this could be as good as I thought it might be, is there? That this would ever happen again? How do I feel about that?" said Gina. "This is a good thing."</p> <p>We lay there, me on top of Gina, cuddled close, her big boobs on my chest, feeling each other's breath on us, her pussy against my penis...</p> <p>"Maybe we should turn the lights on in a couple of hours." Gina said, "I'm not used to seeing that kind of light. Maybe I should be back down here by now."</p> <p>"Hey, hey, hey, hey! That's what we all do." I said with a smile.</p> <p>"Don't move," I whispered. "Just feel me. I'll tell you when I feel you."</p> <p>Gina's vagina was still very wet, and my penis was still hard. I looked at her pussy. Gasped.</p> <p>"So, does it feel good when you feel me?"</p> <p>"Oh yes."</p> <p>"Are you getting excited?"</p> <p>"Very."</p> <p>"I don't care. I'll go slow."</p> <p>"But I want you to go slowly. I don't want to be done with you."</p> <p>"Okay. But don't worry. I'm all yours." She smiled.</p> <p>I put my hands behind Gina, and pulled her toward me. She opened her legs further, and I lifted. I lowered my body, and took my penis into Gina's vagina, it was very wet and warm and moist. I entered her to the hilt, with only the head in. It was tight... but not as tight as a cock that has just been inside the vagina of a person, and I felt a slight discomfort. Gasped again.</p> <p>I slowly began to pump myself into her body, then stopped, and slowly pulled out.</p> <p>"Oh my fucking God, you're not kidding."</p> <p>"Not kidding. I'm really enjoying this." I thought I may have actually heard her out. But the reality was a completely different feeling than it may have been earlier in the day. When Gaby had made love with her brother... when he was a little younger, it was as if nothing had everâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
