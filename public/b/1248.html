We saw a guy in a movie when we went out with them. That guy just seemed to be some big muscle dude.</p> <p>Me: Well, maybe that's what he was. He's a big black guy, like me, he looks exactly like that. He's built like a football player; I think he had a big black football helmet on, no bigger then his own. I'm worried about him. But I'm having trouble believing that the guy will let us know how he is.</p> <p>Gail and I got our clothes back on, and put this on, which I hope is still a bit tight. All of it just seems to be a little too tight. That guy seemed to be really a total stranger. He looked like the sort you might see in horror movies, and there were some of his eyebrows and lashes there. I wonder if he was on stage.</p> <p>The day was pretty uneventful, but we kept hearing the usual rumors about the guy being a big black guy that you would never believe. Well, we got down to dancing again. This time, we made quite the appearance, and I don't think we even noticed anyone walking past us. But it wasn't long before a few of us had gone back home so that we could hang around, and play a little more.</p> <p>It was after midnight when we found ourselves walking to the bar down the block from the bar, and some guy said to me, "Hey buddy, are you in on this party?" I looked at him, then at Gail, and said, "Well, I think this is going to be interesting."</p> <p>The guy looked at Gail, smiled, and said, "You've got him wrong. You're going to fuck this guy." My heart started thudding a little bit, what were they talking about. Then I looked at Gail and she said, "I can't do that, but I think I can."</p> <p>"Hey, I'm not trying for anything here, I'm just going to give these guys a chance for a chance to make a bit of money." Gail said, "Besides, I sure won't want that fat cock of yours anywhere near me, or that asshole of a guy!" I was trying to come up with a plan, and then, the time came when Gail said, "I know you don't have to do this, but it's your call. Why don't we go back to our place, and get comfortable, it won't be weird, but for at least a couple minutes, and maybe some time later maybe, I'll fuck that guy again. Then when I'm done, I'll call you and let you know."</p> <p>"Ok guys, it's time," said Gail, and she was going to get back to the guy she saw walking up.</p> <p>As Gail walked off, I turned and looked at Gail, and she said, "You can go on for a minute." Gail stood up and said, "I really enjoyed the last couple of rounds. And you'll forgive me if we keep bothering him for a while longer."</p> <p>Gail said as she walked away with a grin on her face, "Well I'll see you on the back patio tomorrow night."</p> <p>Gail walked right over to the guy, and said, "Well don't forget to check out the video cameras that he has."</p> <p>Gail turned and walked away, and I couldn't help but look at her ass as she walked away. All I could think was what was that she was trying to get me to do for her. She had that sweet smile on her face that she keeps on smiling at me after a long day at work. I had always found Gail gorgeous, and now she made me look at her everytime she walked by, or if she saw me looking as she did. And she was all alone, so maybe it was time I got to do that.</p> <p>I got back to work the following Saturday night, and I made sure all of the cameras were up, and we found a table on the back patio. I told Gail that it was a one time deal, that she was the only one that could do it. I told her about what happened between Gail and the guy, and Gail said, "OK, but don't worry about it too much; the other guy will probably be here some time tomorrow."</p> <p>Gail went over and sat down next to me. She seemed a little taken off guard, and was still looking me straight in the eye as she said, "That is why I told you that the other guy I saw that night is in on it myself, and I want you and him together for one night."</p> <p>I looked at Gail. She must have seen the look on my face, because she leaned over and kissed me. â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
