"But first you must tell me what you would like for breakfast."</p> <p>"Oh, my love."</p> <p>"The menu in the other room looks delicious."</p> <p>"I'll try it," I said and got up to turn the light off as I walked.</p> <p>"Go on. I won't hear a peep."</p> <p>"I think."</p> <p>I entered the other room without bothering to put on my shorts with my shirt still on, put the tray down and sat back on my bed. I picked up the menu and looked at it closely before putting it back down and looking at the menu. The waiter came in to put the tray down and when he approached, placed it on top of my coffee.</p> <p>"Good choice," I said. "That's good."</p> <p>I put the menu away and pulled out my laptop on the night table. It was in a plastic case on top of it.</p> <p>"It's so pretty," I said to her.</p> <p>"If I were on this plane, I'd be all over you."</p> <p>"I don't want to."</p> <p>"I know, but I do. Sit down and I'll tell you about the menu."</p> <p>While reading the menu, I pulled out a small bottle of wine from underneath the case and poured a glass. After looking at it for a moment, I poured the glass of wine and put it back on the table. Looking at another page I said, "You have everything from a salad dish on, I take it?"</p> <p>"Yes," she said as she pulled on her pajamas.</p> <p>"We just have to eat the breakfast we came here on."</p> <p>"That's fine. Let's do it right."</p> <p>I pulled out a sandwich, ate it and refilled my glass again. Putting mine down on the table, I picked up the order of places and said. "I want them on breakfast in the morning, please. And, please, tell me what you want."</p> <p>"We'll order them on breakfast in the morning, right now."</p> <p>"Good. They're good."</p> <p>"Thank you for making breakfast, sweetheart."</p> <p>"I'm glad you like it. I like it very much."</p> <p>"Can we go into business mode today?"</p> <p>"Anything you want to do, lover. Let me have my lunch, my choice. I'll finish in the morning."</p> <p>"And, please tell me what you're going to do."</p> <p>She gave me a big smile as she answered. "I'm going to have breakfast in my bed this morning. Are you coming at the same time?"</p> <p>"Well, yeah, I don't know. But I promise we'll plan and call in the morning to come back on the plane."</p> <p>Her eyes widened as she said that. "Really?"</p> <p>"Uh huh," I replied.</p> <p>"I'm glad you like my cooking. It tastes so much better this way."</p> <p>"You know I do. We'll go into business mode today because breakfast would be my choice."</p> <p>"So, what are you working on today?"</p> <p>"I thought you might like my cooking."</p> <p>"Oh, that's good. You're the chef. I can only imagine what the other three people in your restaurant can do with your cooking."</p> <p>"Really. I never would have thought cooking could be such an enjoyable skill. You've got an appetite."</p> <p>"Thank you. I love going to restaurants."</p> <p>"And, I don't have a good cook that can do anything as good as you can do. I hope I'll be able to do better than that."</p> <p>"I'm sure you will."</p> <p>"You know they've been asking me to come in here."</p> <p>"We haven't been in here, yet. We could go out to eat in the morning, if you'd like."</p> <p>"That sounds wonderful. I don't know if you're aware of anything about having breakfast in the mornings. I'm not sure when I'll get my coffee. Will it be like last night?"</p> <p>"It might be, maybe," she said. "I'm not sure it is, but I don't mind."</p> <p>"No, don't tell me. You're just joking."</p> <p>"I'm not. But it's nice trying."</p> <p>"I can't tell you that. That will be very awkward. You can just tell it to others, if you don't want to be labeled or something."</p> <p>"Oh, that's sweet. I hate that. I can't tell you the details of what I could do to make it easier for you."</p> <p>"That really turns me onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
