She pulled her lips off him and he let out a long sigh. She stroked him a little with her hand as she bobbed her head on him. She stopped stroking him when she could.</p> <p>"You're so big, Chris. Are you really that good?"</p> <p>"Oh yeah, Ma'am... I'm good." He was breathing harder now, he could barely speak.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful." She leaned down and kissed him, he kissed her back as they kissed long and passionately.</p> <p>He let his legs come down on either side of her. He was now completely at her mercy. He was hers... and she knew it.</p> <p>She had her arms around his neck when she took his cock completely into her mouth. It was a moment that he hadn't ever felt before. He was hers.</p> <p>He felt the vibrations of her moan around his member and could feel her teeth just brush him lightly. It felt electric. He held her head just above his balls and he could still feel the head of his cock as a tiny spark of electricity ran through him as she worked him in and out of her warm, wet mouth.</p> <p>"Ma'am? You're biting me." Chris could barely get the words out. He didn't care anymore.</p> <p>She smiled around him and stroked him harder.</p> <p>"Yeah, that's okay. You can say it, babe."</p> <p>Chris nodded and moaned out the same words as he had when he had been in hers, "Ma'am... ooooh, yeah, Ms. Lacy, suck..." His words were a little slurred. He was still on his elbows because he had to tilt his head to get her to take him again.</p> <p>Ms. Lacy stopped sucking him and looked up and grinned around his cock. She stroked it harder and kept one fist wrapped around him as she stroked him, rubbing the tip of him in a circle. Her fingers kept on stroking him a little slower as she licked the precum off his tip.</p> <p>"Oooooh, Chris... I'm a little dizzy. I'm dizzy with your cock inside my mouth."</p> <p>"No," he breathed, as he moved his mouth up the length of her neck. "Ma'am, can I just... please pull off?"</p> <p>"I want you to move on my cock, baby." She lifted her body up and let him suck her again. "I want you to fuck me as I'm blowing you. And I want you to push your hard, big cock into me as I'm blowing you."</p> <p>Chris's arms moved up and around her before he realized that she was pulling him down on her. He laid on her as she wrapped her hands and legs around him and guided him easily into her. The angle was amazing as he went deeper and deeper into her. He kept on his elbows as her legs squeezed his waist. She was so strong and so far, and he had to brace himself by pinching and pulling on her nipples.</p> <p>Ms. Lacy lifted her hips up and then sunk back down the length of his cock with some effort. Her fingers dug into his back as she kept on stroking him. He wanted to move on her... wanted to keep fucking her as they were fucking her at the moment. But his feet were still on the floor and he was on his tip toes as she bounced up and down on him. Her eyes were closed, and his mouth was glued over hers. She took it like that like that... he couldn't move. The pleasure he was feeling was indescribable. He didn't know how much more he could stand.</p> <p>She was moaning. Chris didn't know how much more he could take. Her legs were still on his waist. He looked down to see that her breasts were moving up and down with each bounce.</p> <p>"Ma'am, can I... ummmm... can I put my face right here?"</p> <p>He moaned, "God, Chris, I don't care. That's all I want. Please put your face and my cock next to your lips as I fuck you."</p> <p>It was as if she knew exactly what he wanted. She smiled and nodded once. She pulled herself up and kissed him as she lay down on her side.</p> <p>"Put your hands under me." She laid her head on her arm and kissed him again before she spoke back up. "Chris, I'm so close."</p> <p>"Yes, Ma'am, please. I want to make you cum... for me." He didn't know how she could do that. It was as if she read his mind.
