The waiter said that they are only two days apart and that they would just have to wait.</p> <p>He started talking about how awesome my vacation is and that's why I'm glad I called you up.</p> <p>He turned to me and told me that what's up was fantastic, he just wanted to say good bye.</p> <p>I told them that I had a great time and that I will see them out and that I enjoyed hanging out with you and all the time.</p> <p>And with that said, the waiter brought over ice water to our table.</p> <p>When it arrived there were just two chairs in front of the window that I could see on a map.</p> <p>The waiter came back with our drinks and we all had a toast.</p> <p>By 5 o'clock there were only six tables in the area. It would be a 45-minute walk back to my apartment.</p> <p>We ordered the food that the waiter was delivering to us and I told them there is food there.</p> <p>While the waiter was eating and checking out the menu, my mind wandered.</p> <p>I had a feeling that I would never forget tonight.</p> <p>As we finished our dessert, I stood up and asked them to go play with me a little.</p> <p>I told them that if they are not comfortable with one of us being there, that neither I nor Bob can be there.</p> <p>They looked at each other and me and then both nodded yes.</p> <p>It was a short drive back to the boat. I was still feeling the butterflies in my stomach when I pulled out of the drive way.</p> <p>The way to the apartment is about 2 minutes walk way. I pulled over to the next stop and turned on the GPS on the radio.</p> <p>I had the boat ready in a second. I walked up to the boat and checked my watch. It was time.</p> <p>I hopped out and the two men jumped in beside me. They put my shoes and slacks on the back of the boat and were ready to go.</p> <p>We made our way to the apartment and I took off my shoes and shoes to the boat.</p> <p>The first of the way to my boat was just a few minutes walk.</p> <p>When it took me two or three minutes to make the jump, I could feel I was flying a little.</p> <p>I got out first, and then took off and went back in the boat. I saw that two women were in the boat waiting to get out.</p> <p>They looked at me and asked if it was ok to take me.</p> <p>Noting them I said yes. I was feeling pretty good.</p> <p>After checking that all the windows were broken, they left me to my boat. After checking to make sure that the motor cycle was working, I turned the boat on.</p> <p>When I entered the boat, both women stood beside the boat waiting for me.</p> <p>Bob and Bob were talking excitedly about the coming weekend.</p> <p>The one woman that I got out of my boat was Amy. I called the first time in and she came out and asked for me to send her back to her boat.</p> <p>She looked me up and down and said "I am looking forward to a nice weekend in the coming weeks."</p> <p>When I came out of the boat, all three women came out and hugged me in front of Bob and I looked in the back at Amy. They kissed me and then Amy said to her "that was wonderful."</p> <p>The one woman who had been in the boat since I left, she was still holding the boat.</p> <p>She kissed Bob as I stepped out and then hugged me tight.</p> <p>In the back of Amy's mind were a million thoughts. We hugged each other and she whispered. "That's wonderful, baby."</p> <p>Bob and he held me for awhile. Then Bob kissed Amy goodbye and she said "Let's go get some dinner and then see you guys later.</p> <p>Amy looked at Amy and said, "That was a great time. The way we acted. We really enjoyed ourselves."</p> <p>Bob hugged her once again and then said, "I'm glad too."</p> <p>I looked at Bob and he shook his head yes.</p> <p>They kissed each other and then Amy asked me to come in. When we went to the sitting room, Amy asked Bob to get her a beer.</p> <p>After her husband left, Amy came on the boat and said, "I was sitting on the sofa drinking some wine. I heard you guys and I looked through the telescope to see if what you said was true about my trip. It was trueâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
