Can you feel the way that the two of us got ourselves carried away in that little game?"</p> <p>"No way? I thought you said that this was a trick! I thought you... well, I guess I do love you."</p> <p>"Oh don't you worry dear, I really love you. I just hope it's not the same thing you've been thinking."</p> <p>With that, she rose from the couch and led me across the room to my bedroom and the two of them closed the door behind us and turned on the night radio. We settled comfortably on the king size bed and began to listen as the radio played a soothing tune.</p> <p>"How did you find me?</p> <p>"There's little to tell since my car is in the driveway, but you seemed to need a place to stay... I can explain later. Just be yourself with me, honey."</p> <p>"Yes, I am," I promised and we spent the next two hours on the couch and in various situations, dancing around and laughing about the wonderful time we'd just had.</p> <p>In the middle of it, the doorbell rang at about 8:30 and we decided to go get the pizza. We had pizza and a couple of tall, good-sized steaks, both of us agreeing to the latter and I did the same because my stomach was growling so loudly that I had to wipe my mouth.</p> <p>When I came out of the bathroom, all that was left on the couch were our bras, panties and high heel shoes! We took them off and we were both feeling a little better. I looked down at my boobs and saw that my nipples had hardened and seemed to point out the room through the thin fabric.</p> <p>"That's for me, dear", I said. "Let me help." I stepped up on the couch and lay down between my husband's legs and began to suck my husband's cock. The whole time, I was smiling and nodding while my hand stroked and moved to his balls while I sucked his cock. We were making out and he was moaning and enjoying my mouth; my head bobbed up and down like it was about to swallow it.</p> <p>I could hear the sounds of soft cocks being sucked and balls being stimulated in different ways. I could feel the warm, gooey feel of the sperm being extracted. I also could feel my man's body reacting to the act, so I was in a good position to suck and fondle it, too... then he pulled my head away after a second or so and I smiled up at him and said, "There is something else I want to do for you."</p> <p>"Whatever you say, baby", he mumbled.</p> <p>He then rose up and went to my other side, still on the couch, and pulled me to him on top of him.</p> <p>My husband's right hand reached down and went to my pussy, he began fingering me there as I continued sucking his cock. The combination of his hard dick being inside my body and my mouth on his balls was enough to turn me on just as much as it was the thought of his hand rubbing my clit!</p> <p>"Here, let me get that cock inside here," I said as I lifted myself up, straddled his penis and reached down to guide him where he was going. He didn't need any more prompting and slipped inside, and it was heaven. It felt way more wonderful than I ever imagined, like I'd felt in my own body, but unlike in the movie, just as good as it felt. I just moaned and sighed in his arms as the two of us fucked... with it just a little longer than the movie.</p> <p>We were still a minute or so from cumming together when our breathing returned to normal and we collapsed on the bed next to each other. It was like a love-making that wasn't even in play. "I love you!" I told him as I fell asleep.</p> <p>"I love you so much, dear", he replied. "Now, I think we should go to bed."</p> <p>I was getting the drift of the conversation at that point, so I just went ahead and did the same, too. When we got up after about 5 or 6 minutes, my husband just couldn't believe we were doing what we just had to do.</p> <p>"Oh honey", I cooed, "you've been a while. Let's go upstairs and make love and sleep." And he had. I don't think he was quite fully recovered when I took him by the hand and led him to the bed. I lay down on my side and cuddled him close, holding some part of the time that I didn't fully recover from that first time with my husband, to keep him warm.</p> <p>I think he probablyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
