As they turned into their parking garage, he leaned over and gave her cheek a light smack, "You sure were, babe." She smiled and climbed out of the car like a naughty little schoolgirl. She wanted him sooo bad!</p> <p>"See you in court on Monday," Jack teased as they walked inside.</p> <p>"Yeah, sure," Sarah replied with a smile.</p> <p>She thought back to his words, "I couldn't say no, my big bad boss." The day started well and she felt relieved when she got home. She didn't even mind knowing that Jack and his other female co-workers didn't notice.</p> <p>Jack gave the big houseguest his number and they sat down in front until she came in to the living room. He took off his T-shirt and was ready to give up when Sarah made a noise.</p> <p>"Damn, where the hell had that come from? Your boyfriend was never here, Sarah."</p> <p>Sarah went to sit next to Jack, but he placed both hands on her chest. "No way. The game was cancelled. I am glad you had been so nice, especially when you were a big bitch, so I was a bitch myself."</p> <p>"Okay," she said with a smile. She reached over and gave him a playful punch in the cheek. "It was nice to finally get your attention."</p> <p>"Yeah," he responded. "I have got to get this game away from you before my mom comes down stairs."</p> <p>"What about your friend, Sarah?" Jack continued, "Why don't I come by every now and again and try to cheer for you."</p> <p>"We just had a little bit of a fight the first time," Jack replied. "Maybe we can talk about it tomorrow."</p> <p>"Okay," Sarah responded, "Whatever," as he was starting to smile. She turned to leave, but he called to her. "Where are we going?"</p> <p>"I'm going to take a shower."</p> <p>"Oh," Jack said, "I thought you didn't want to talk about my girlfriend, babe?"</p> <p>"I didn't ask," Sarah responded a bit defensively, "I thought... I thought it was good that it might be awkward."</p> <p>"Why did you talk about Sarah tonight?" he asked, "Your girlfriend might want to talk to me about our relationship...?"</p> <p>"Hey!" Sarah protested. "I'm not sure what to say!"</p> <p>"Listen," he said, "You got lucky last night. You'll have the place to yourself. I was trying to play it cool, but you turned it into a big game of chicken."</p> <p>"I didn't turn it into a big game of chicken." Sarah replied, "What happened last night was just a little crazy. You can get upset about anything he says."</p> <p>"But you're right. We need to work with ourselves, we need to get on with our lives." He tried to convince her. The big game of chicken started earlier than it had, but was something that could not be played off, they just needed more time to get there.</p> <p>"Whatever." Sarah said with a shrug.</p> <p>Sparrow and Jack returned to their game. By the third inning the ball had changed its attitude and the game had come to its end.</p> <p>"That was nice?" Jack asked as he looked over at Sarah.</p> <p>"You sure were, didn't you?" Sarah replied. "I guess I was hoping to win."</p> <p>"It was fun! And your friend played a big part in what was going on between us," Jack assured her with a smile, "And you can bet your life that I'll probably see you again, Sarah. We'll have so much sex like crazy, you'll see."</p> <p>Sarah got up and walked over to Jack. "So do you want to have a few beers with me?" she asked him as she slipped onto his lap. She was wearing a pair of tight yoga pants, which barely covered her cheeks. They were so tight that it barely covered her pussy, which only made Jack happy to her. He pulled out a can of Coke out of his pocket and handed it to her, "How about it?"</p> <p>"Sure," Sarah said, "Would you like to go get us some beers?"</p> <p>"Of course, honey," he replied.</p> <p>Jack got back in the car and they rode off. She took the opportunity to give him a sexy half-smile.</p> <p>"Have you been wearing that outfit for much longer?" Jack asked.</p> <p>"About ten minutes," she said, "It's been awhile since my boyfriend and I went out."</p> <p>"I see," Jack acknowledged.
