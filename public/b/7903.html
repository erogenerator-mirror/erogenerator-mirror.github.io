Her eyes widened as she looked down. He was so big; her mouth watered. He walked around her and held his hand out to her. She didn't hesitate to take it as he stood close to her. She knew in just one look that he knew what she needed. He leaned toward her, his mouth finding hers and they were both lost in desire. The intensity of their need was more than she had had in a long time. His hand came up, he took her chin and tilted her head up to him while his tongue probed her mouth. Their mutual desire was all consuming. Her body was quivering from his touching. His body was hard and throbbing.</p> <p>Her lips slid down his jaw, she sucked as his tongue danced with hers. Her body had never received such passion from another as this in her life. He had always had his mouth filled with desire for her. This was not the first time. His fingers tangled in her curls, sliding through her wet curls. She groaned and pushed his body toward her. His mouth found hers again as her arms wrapped around their bodies. Her breathing became uneven as his hands slid down to cup those soft, firm globes of her ass. He wanted to press himself against her as he broke their kiss. The pressure built as they both reached for the pleasure center, the center of her passion. Her hands found the buttons on his shirt and he knew what she wanted.</p> <p>His hand slipped under hers, cupping her breast in his palm. The softness and feel of the softness. The heat of his palm against her nipple made her groan. His lips kissed down her neck and found her earlobe. His fingers slid under the buttons and she realized his need to suck her nipple. His cock swelled as if seeking entrance. She felt the wetness grow as his fingers worked its way down over her abdomen. The heat of his arousal between his legs intensified as his breath came in quick gasps. His fingers trailed along her inner thigh to her crotch.</p> <p>"Are you horny," he asked in a sultry voice.</p> <p>"If it is what you want," she whispered.</p> <p>Her hips lifted off the ground as her hands caressed along the ridges of his back. Her pussy was dripping. His mouth moved from her ear to the hollow of her cheek.</p> <p>"Mmmm, you're so sexy," he said as his hands moved down to the hem of her skirt. His hands tugged at it. She let out a groan of desire as his hands pressed her to the floor of the parking garage.</p> <p>"Get the fuck off this car," he hissed in her ear. He kissed her neck, just to the side of it. His teeth bit and licked. Her body had been tingling in all directions from his touch. Her mind had been running on pins and needles; her lips puckered from her earlier kiss. His teeth slid back as he spoke.</p> <p>"I haven't been touching you in a long time, but just look at you. Look at the way you're responding to me."</p> <p>He kissed his way down her collarbone. His hands were on her breasts as he knelt in front of her. When his tongue found the swollen nub of her nipple, she gasped. When his lips took it into his mouth and sucked, he felt her body shift. His hands moved along her sides to her hips and as she raised her bottom toward him, her hands found his hair, pulling it as hard as she could. When he bit her nipple she was almost hysterical. She cried out and grabbed his head to kiss him.</p> <p>She tried to pull her body away from him. He knew, with all of them, that she would submit. As his lips covered her and sucked at the erect length of her breast, he lifted her body, his arms under her buttocks to keep her body from straining. He began kissing down her torso, over her belly, down to her thighs. She felt him shift his position as his lips grazed over her swollen lips. As he kissed her through her panties, she spread her legs inviting him to remove her underwear.</p> <p>He smiled when he heard her whimper when he lifted the front of her panties and removed them. His hands slid along her thighs until they came to rest between her thighs. He looked up into the lustful blue eyes. His mouth covered her flesh for a moment as he inhaled of her. Then his hands were at her hips lifting her body in a way he didn't think possible. He pulled her into him and they both had the release they both craved. Their mouths moved together slowly, passionately, almost like old lovers.</p> <p>As her bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
