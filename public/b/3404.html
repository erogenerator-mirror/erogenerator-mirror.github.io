She smiled.</p> <p>"It might not be that bad," I concluded.</p> <p>"We are supposed to be together, and it was your idea for me to go to the park on Friday. It's a perfect excuse for a game and a free night," she said with a laugh.</p> <p>"So, are we going to be roommates?" I asked.</p> <p>"No," she responded, "you are mine for the night until morning, we won't be sneaking around anymore. Then you will be doing what ever you want to do," she stated.</p> <p>"I don't know where our rules are right now," I joked.</p> <p>"They are pretty simple. We can be together as if we were a couple," she reasoned.</p> <p>"So it's either that I have to fuck your brains out," I retorted.</p> <p>"And, you won't have to even cum," she said.</p> <p>"That's pretty bad, it's just a little scary," I laughed.</p> <p>"We have another couple coming over," she explained.</p> <p>"I didn't get to last time," I said.</p> <p>"You will soon enough," she assured me.</p> <p>"I'm not giving it to you," I countered.</p> <p>"We're not going to fuck again, we are going to be roommates all night," she proclaimed, "and we are going to take care of it. Now, I am going to go start getting ready."</p> <p>She turned her back on me. She bent over the arm of the couch. Her dress bunched up at the front where it fell on the floor. A white bra was visible between her legs. As I took off my shirt, I felt a finger press on my rear and the top of my bare thigh. Her finger ran back and forth along the crack of my ass and down to the front of my thigh where she slowly probed inside me to feel the moisture there. She fingered me a moment before pulling away from me and turning around. She had a grin on her face as she looked me up and down.</p> <p>"You like it up the ass?" she teased.</p> <p>I shook my head no.</p> <p>"You did it on purpose didn't you?" she teased. "I like that."</p> <p>"I like it, too," I agreed.</p> <p>"I guess you are right," she said smiling, "but, let's find out how you do it. So, now that we've had some time alone, you just lie down," she said with a laugh.</p> <p>I laid down and she slid onto her back beside me. A second later, my hands were all over her body and my face was buried between her legs. As I licked and sucked her juices from her, she was rubbing her nipples with her hands. My face was soon flooded with her juice, it was dripping down my chin and onto the couch. It was so sweet; she tasted like a sweet fruit. I found my own scent and my tongue found hers more than ever before.</p> <p>I felt her hands on my back as she felt how hard she had become. She was aching to run her fingernails over it.</p> <p>"My, we have been waiting for this," she breathed.</p> <p>We began to move around on her bed, kissing and tonguing each other until we ended up on top of her. My hands roamed over her body from her face to the back down to her ass. I had never felt anything quite like it when it happened to me. I massaged her ass as it moved across her body. She reached under herself and played with the hairs on my body. We kissed as we rocked on the bed and continued to caress each other until she began to convulse with pleasure. I heard her cry out with the pleasure. I held her close as she convulsed in ecstasy.</p> <p>"Are you okay?" I asked between breaths, concerned about how quickly her orgasm had subsided.</p> <p>"Yeah, it's a little strange, but...I don't know, I can't get enough of it," she said as we slowed down and began to breathe normally.</p> <p>"It's my turn to take care of it," I quipped once more.</p> <p>We kissed and moved together until we lay down next to each other. It wasn't long before both of us wereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
