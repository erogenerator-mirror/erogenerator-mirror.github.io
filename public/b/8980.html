She said, "I'm the King of Elves."</p> <p>"Aye, and yet I only hear elves," I replied, "I'm glad that's what it is. We both have our own names and they're both powerful warriors." Jael smirked and looked away, "But you can't know that for certain yet. Are you a dwarf?" She asked me quietly.</p> <p>"No," I said, "no, but then your question could be right for me."</p> <p>Jael's grin returned and she looked off into the trees, "Perhaps that is a good place for you to start to think," she said, "because there is a cave below our camp."</p> <p>"Where is it?"</p> <p>"Aye," she said quietly, "that cave is just the right distance and has a bath. What better place to talk with my brothers then a bath?"</p> <p>Jael and I shared a smile and I thought that perhaps I could start talking.</p> <p>"How old are you two?" Jael asked.</p> <p>"We're... thirteen."</p> <p>Jael nodded and I nodded, "That might not surprise me for a change of clothes. We're not sure how well they do work... but we need some supplies since we're being hunted."</p> <p>"They're not so badly off-guard." She stated, smiling, "We'll know soon enough when we get there."</p> <p>We turned back to the camp and I started to head up to the cave. We both paused and Jael looked surprised but quickly put on what she looked like. We walked back inside and I turned to face her.</p> <p>"Well," Jael said with a grin, "it seems we have a lot in common. Why don't we both go to the bath and then we'll let you talk without your hands."</p> <p>I had a strange feeling that Jael was going to argue in favour of it, and though we didn't really have anything against fighting for the honor...I had no doubt that she'd have a lot of fighting and probably a lot of pain.</p> <p>I went to Jael's side and sat down to talk to her as she led us up the hill to the bath. The stone floor was covered in small stones and as Jael got to the bath, I could see that she had her back to me. I could also see that with her back I was looking at her lovely golden golden hair which framed the roundest lips. My cock stirred and I felt that somehow the only thing she looked like was my sister.</p> <p>It took my mind a minute or so to get to the bath and as I sat Jael leaned over and started to wash my back and shoulders. I thought she might be offended but that thought quickly disappeared when she started to stroke my penis and then slowly took me into her mouth...</p> <p>******</p> <p>The next morning, the elf Jael was sitting on the bench when she got up.</p> <p>"Morning," Jael said. Her eyes twinkled as well, "did you sleep with the elven girl last night?"</p> <p>"Of course." I said, "I had a lovely time."</p> <p>Jael nodded as she finished washing, "I bet that elf girl was a good fuck."</p> <p>"I think I may have done." I replied a bit smugly.</p> <p>"I'm sure you did. I bet she had one of the best fucks in the world. Don't you... think that's a hot little elf?" Jael said smiling at me, "Why don't you let her take you for a spin?"</p> <p>She quickly turned around and grabbed my cock with her hands.</p> <p>"There's plenty of time..." she said, "I want you to fuck me first."</p> <p>"Oh yeah!" I replied, "I like to feel you against me..."</p> <p>She smiled and then moved her head down and licked the helmet of my cock. She used her tongue on the head of my cock, feeling my thickness in her mouth.</p> <p>"I love it when a man lets you suck him in the morning." Jael said, "Mmm, not as much as with a woman."</p> <p>I was entranced watching as she worked on my cock; there was nothing a wizard could do without experiencing some magic - even the simplest of methods - and she would sometimes take me in her mouth before letting me cum in it.</p> <p>"Would any girl be allowed to do this?" Jael asked.</p> <p>I was just about to answer when she took my hand and put it inside her skirt...</p> <p>"Mmm, I want to see that little elf with my hands," Jael said, reaching behind her to unhook her shirt before letting it pull open and revealing her bare breasts. She leaned back, pushing her breasts outâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
