I looked into her eyes and saw her tear-stained face. We said nothing for a moment, but I felt the first signs of a moment of sadness in her eyes. I moved to kiss her and she held me tightly in her arms, sobbing softly into my shoulder. I began to gently push my way backward, slipping under the sheets and between her legs. I could feel her naked thighs pressing into my own as my cock made its way up to her love-filled entrance. Her cries were becoming frantic and her legs parted even more so I felt the wet flesh press between them. She gasped, “Oh, God, yes, yes,... oh, God, yes....”</p> <p>I felt her tighten around me, and she began to shudder almost immediately, grinding down onto me as she sobbed into my shoulder and came down from her high, grinding her body into mine. We lay there, holding each other close in a quiet embrace, just enjoying the contact of our bodies. Finally, she whispered to me, “I have to tell Mary about this, I just felt like I had to tell you. She told me that she loved me as well, but couldn’t get the whole story out of her head. This is the whole point of being a woman—and becoming a woman isn’t just any woman you see on the news—" I smiled at her.</p> <p>"Yes, of course," I agreed, "but I really enjoyed it. You and Ann had such a beautiful time, we were just so comfortable and together." I was silent for a second, savoring her response. "I've only just gotten back to my bedroom when you came around in a dress, and, looking at you, I knew that you could have anything you liked. I know that I said anything, but if you really liked it, yes, I did." I kissed her cheek gently, then, "Please forgive me for making you cry, my little love-lover."</p> <p>She raised her head, smiling sweetly, and said, "Yes, Michael, I really liked it - and more - - especially the way you and Ann kissed each other. And as I told Ann, I loved you. It was so nice of you to make me do this with you, and it felt so right. I told her that I liked being with you—that I’d been lonely without you for a long time. I was sorry to do this, but thought that if I ever saw Ann again, we'd never meet. I hope that you will come to me before tonight.”</p> <p>I had to respond. "Ann has not been like you," I told her. “But she hasn’t lost her touch, either. She said that she loved being with you, and you are very exciting, very beautiful, and you were wonderful to be with. But I just wanted you to know.”</p> <p>"No, Michael, I don’t want to hear anything from you until tonight. I think you are beautiful and you really are the one..."</p> <p>She held me tighter to her and kissed me again, softly, and said, "I love you so much, and I think that you and Ann really are, really, close now..."</p> <p>As she spoke, I felt her tongue slide between my lips and, as she had with me before, began to probe, seeking my tongue out with hers. We kissed more hungrily now, feeling the intensity of our passion increase, as she moved her arms around me. She moved her lips so that they grazed over the tender flesh of my face, and then let her tongue explore, to taste, to explore, to caress. Her hands began to gently pinch the nipples of her ample breasts, as her tongue became more urgent, and her kisses became more intense, and her soft hand slowly slid down my body, rubbing, kneading. When she brushed lightly, I had to gasp and try to control my excitement, as she stopped there, with her mouth still full of my flesh.</p> <p>"Oh, Ann," I gasped, "I so love the way you feel."</p> <p>"I do, Michael. And the way you feel is so nice, too.” She smiled at me, and as our tongues danced, she began to pull me towards the bed, and I moved with her. She had her head between my shoulder blades to hold me in, and she used it to push herself up so that I could straddle her waist. She felt so wonderful, and I began to kiss and nibble my way down her long, slender neck, then over her shoulder to her lovely breasts, and began to suck and bite her nipples, then lower to her areolas, where I sucked gently before licking and running my tongue and lips around her hardened buds, and her hands came down—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
