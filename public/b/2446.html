I was becoming aroused from just looking at them but I was so aroused that I had nothing to do but continue to stare. "Did you get a hard on watching me, John?" she asked with a cheekiness that I couldn't quite believe.</p> <p>I couldn't speak. I was still speechless at the sight of her so petite body and the way her legs ended a little above her knee and her skirt rode up all the way exposing herself to the world. I was afraid she'd look down and find my erection and pull it towards her, but instead, she moved the other leg over to stand next to me. "What do you think of the view, John?" she asked turning back to face the window. She put a hand on the back of my neck pulling my face towards hers. I was surprised to feel the firmness of her breast press against my cheek. I couldn't understand what she was asking.</p> <p>"I'm a bit embarrassed by it, Amanda." I said as a bit of a pout came to my lips. "I'm actually kind of embarrassed that you saw what I have." I stuttered out making her laugh.</p> <p>"Oh, you don't have to apologize for saying what you think you want to say," she said as she put a finger under my chin and pulled my face towards hers. "I was just wondering if this would make you hard." she said as her hand moved to the inside of my thigh, then grabbed me tight and pulled me towards her. When I reached the top of the step on the right I felt her breath on my ear. She whispered in my ear, "Would you want me to do this?" and lifted my chin with the back of her hand. Her hands lifted my dress up, just so it would reveal my naked sex. "Do you see how wet I am?" she asked as my heart raced in anticipation. I nodded.</p> <p>"You know what you have to do," she giggled. "I'm not even wearing underwear and you have to touch me so I can feel you on me." As quick as she came up with the idea, she pulled back quickly and sat down next to me on the steps. I was feeling very embarrassed but also very turned on and my erection was pressed hard against my pant leg. "Do you think that will help with the embarrassment?" She ran her finger along my cheek and over my lips. I was breathing hard myself and I felt like I might be about to explode at any second. She leaned in and kissed me on the cheek. "I'm so happy you like it," she whispered in my ear as she kissed me gently on the other side.</p> <p>I suddenly realized what she had said, and it wasn't just what we were doing but how excited and aroused I was. I was beginning to have an erection, my cock was fully erect. She took one of my hands and placed it on one of her breasts and I let my hand move to it while caressing her breast. "Do you think you can do that, John?" she asked still holding my face with her hand as she continued to kiss me. I could have kissed her all day if we had stayed this way, but she pulled off of me, took the blindfold off of my eyes and let me look. I could see that she had put the blindfold on after all. She walked over to one of the other steps on the right and stood just above me for a minute, just a foot or so above my head. She asked, "Do you still want to see more?" she asked as her hand moved over to where I could see myself from the eye up. She said, "I want to see if that's what I can't see from the eye as it's pointing at me." She then moved her eyes from my cock to my face, smiled and asked, "Do you want me to touch you?"</p> <p>Without a word, I nodded yes, then took her hand and stood up. She looked into my eyes and gently touched my erection with her fingers. "It's as hard as you promised," she whispered.</p> <p>I pulled her towards me and she wrapped her arms around my neck kissing me again on the cheek. My hands were resting on her bare breasts and the soft skin of her breasts was making me dizzy with desire for her, and she slid her own hands down and started to unzip my pants letting my erection free. I could feel the moistness between her legs as she removed my shoes and socks. "My god that's hot," she said as the tip of my penis was being fondled by her hand. "Do anything else," she asked as she looked me in the eyes.</p> <p>I didn't reply.
