I just couldn't tell if the grin on his face was a smile I felt or even, what would it be? I had to wonder if it was, at that point, because he had stopped. He looked up and met my eyes. For the first time in a long time, I felt fear. I looked at his eyes again as he looked at me; I knew instantly that he was afraid of me.</p> <p>"How do we start?" He asked. I just nodded and he went back to the counter. We worked together, he started by taking care of the register. I started at a regular wage. This was my first work shift and he was the owner. As he bent over to get some money I got a nice view of that firm backside. I was tempted to reach and squeeze it but I resisted; I was going to keep working.</p> <p>"Excuse me," I managed to say and he turned.</p> <p>"Hello." His smile wasn't so much friendly as it was predatory. He had a strong accent but didn't sound too close to his mom. The thing that really caught my attention in that moment was that I could easily be imagining that of the other people in the store. I looked past the counter at my mom who had stood to greet us. Her smile and wave of her hand told me that I was in for one of the best of both worlds.</p> <p>"Thank you for coming," she said as she took the man's wallet. As one by one they moved out of the office toward the elevator. I started to follow the man as he made his way to the elevators while the woman took the man's bags and followed suit. I had to keep my eye on the doors for now. This was a first timer. It probably wouldn't be the last. When they showed they could easily have reached the elevator, but I had to concentrate on the job to pass time. They started to leave and I followed the man, which had a big purpose in the process. A couple of floors later, the elevator door opened and the woman stepped inside. She was looking out the door; we were within a few second of each other. We just looked at each other. We didn't speak for a few seconds before he leaned over and kissed me. I could feel his stubbles against me and I just melted.</p> <p>"Hello," he said as he held the door with both hands. I didn't pull away once for fear that my eyes might follow his, but that wasn't going to happen. We walked into the office and I closed the door. He smiled a big smile and sat down behind his desk.</p> <p>"So you're the man of the house?" he asked. I leaned my head in my hands and looked at him.</p> <p>"No," I replied. "Let's just say my dad is pretty damn good with women." I gave him the best smile he ever gave me and turned and started working again. I was trying to follow in his footsteps so I would be careful but I couldn't think that I could stop him. He was working me so well and making my knees go weak. I turned and started to walk around his desk but decided against it. I wanted to get something more from him. I just wanted him to give me the chance for me to get whatever I wanted while we were in the office. I started working on the shelves again and he leaned up and looked over his shoulder at me.</p> <p>"You really are a woman," he finally said. It was enough that I took his words for what they were. I smiled and told him so, but the rest of the day I could see that he was in for a repeat of my fantasy.</p> <p>Friday</p> <p>Saturday</p> <p>Sunday</p> <p>Monday</p> <p>Wednesday</p> <p>Thursday</p> <p>Friday</p> <p>Saturday - Thursday</p> <p>Monday - Monday</p> <p>The rest of the weekend went very uneventfully; I was in a kind of depression that morning with the thoughts I had had for over a year. I didn't think about my feelings or anything else for a while because I knew I was still young and not capable of finding happiness in just being someone you wanted to be with. I didn't think about the other guys I had slept with because I wasn't sure that was a good idea. I didn't have much experience with that sort of thing as a guy. I wasn't that interested in being a top for anyone. I had been pretty quiet about things at home.</p> <p>I tried to get back to work, but it wasn't easy. I kept thinking about the guy I had been screwing. I just kept thinking about it instead of trying to be more man than woman, and I was in the middle of a bad marriage without anyone but myself to keep me safe. I wasn't readyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
