He reached his erection.</p> <p>It was large, thick, a little longer than his own and his precum made his shaft glisten. She wrapped her hand around it and squeezed softly. "We're going to have this nice and hard all night," she whispered. "I'll be careful and take nice, gentle care."</p> <p>He lay on the bed beside her, his fingers moving over the softness of her stomach. Her breathing quickened, her lips parted as she pulled on the end of his cock - and he tasted his own precum as he moved across and took the head of his cock in his hand.</p> <p>"I want to show your mother a great deal more than her husband," he told her. "I want to see how you react to the pain on that beautiful cock."</p> <p>She opened her mouth wide and took in his head. Her teeth scraped over it, feeling the hard flesh press the side of it. She was enjoying the sensation and could feel it swelling. She held his shaft in her hand, holding it steady and feeling his soft skin throbbed as it swelled between her fingers.</p> <p>She pushed her nose against his navel, breathing in his scent, and she could taste the salt in her nose as it slid down his body. She took his cock into her mouth and she held it. Her tongue ran over the underside as she continued her exploration. She brought him close to her throat, just above the flare of his belly, where her face sat, but his cock was too far out.</p> <p>"Is this okay?" she asked, breathing through her nose.</p> <p>"Oh yeah. You take care of that long piece of man meat."</p> <p>His fingers moved over her stomach and down over her panties. There was no feeling at all between their two bodies, no pressure but there was, she decided. He had given up control of himself and she was going to give up control of him. She pulled down the panties, exposing her body and let gravity pull her body forward.</p> <p>The feeling of her bare pubic hair was like an electric shock across his fingers, pulling him forward. He heard the soft moans, smelled the fragrance of her arousal, could feel the sweet heat of her pussy through her soft mons.</p> <p>She felt something on her face and she opened her eyes to see him leaning over to kiss her. She watched his lips move over hers as he put his hand down on her stomach and he ran his fingers over the top of her pussy hair. Her pussy lips felt wet through the hair as his fingers pulled aside. She could smell her pussy on his fingers and he moved both fingers down between her legs.</p> <p>He had the hair inside her lips and he spread the skin and the skin moved up and down over her clit. He put some more of her juices on her clit and his fingers slid around it, holding her lips open for him. She watched as he took his hand away, and she saw his long cock twitch and she felt wetness on one of her ass cheeks and her skin was slippery. She saw the wetness as his fingers spread her lips open, and he saw her.</p> <p>"Yes," she whispered. "Touch me there, Jack."</p> <p>He was so wet and he rubbed her. He moved his hips to make the contact, moved his hips forward and his tongue licked the tiny hole of her pussy. She shuddered - felt wetness pool between the bottom of her cheeks. He could feel her hard clit underneath, could smell her hot skin, could feel the warmth of her body and watched her.</p> <p>This was different. This was an intimate act - one that they hadn't done just yet. He felt her body twitch as he licked at her, could smell her juices on his hand, heard the sound of her moaning, could hear the sounds she made as she approached orgasm.</p> <p>"Make me cum, Jack," she gasped.</p> <p>He moved his body closer to hers, felt her legs move, and when she was close to orgasm he slipped his fingers inside her as his tongue flicked over her clit. He pulled his tongue away as she moaned. He slid up hers and kissed her. Their tongues went back into each other's mouths and her head fell backward as her breath came in gasps as she came.</p> <p>He came up off of her, still holding her lips open for him, and when his hand left her body it moved to her stomach. She felt the skin over the curve of her belly for the first time and looked up at him.</p> <p>"I want to see if you can get it in," he said.</p> <p>She couldn'tâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
