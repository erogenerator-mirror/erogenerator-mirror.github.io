He pressed a finger into her silky wetness. He heard her soft moan of approval.</p> <p>"And do you think you may do it again?" Jakob asked her softly.</p> <p>She smiled at him mischievously, "It's fun." She said.</p> <p>They lay there quietly for a minute enjoying each others body as it heated up. This time, they both wanted to make it last some more. They shifted and began to kiss.</p> <p>Jakob slowly and gently slid out from between her thighs and stood up looking down at her. He stood there in awe. Her face was smiling up at him and then she moved her face nearer to him and his soft lips opened.</p> <p>Jakob's lips met hers and her kiss was full of passion. After a moment the kiss stopped. Jakob looked her in the eyes and saw a mischievous grin start to creep up her face. In that moment they both remembered the night with them together, the night she did it without hesitation.</p> <p>His tongue began to search for a path to her mouth and she took it as an invitation. She pulled away from him to look into his eyes. She saw what had aroused his cock and she saw the lust burning deep in his eyes.</p> <p>"I want you again", she whispered to him.</p> <p>Jakob grinned as he leaned forward and kissed her again. As they kissed, he ran his hands over her body. He reached down and undid her shorts and pulled them down, revealing her body. He began to kiss and lick at the exposed flesh, her breasts were large and heavy, her nipples were long and hard. He licked her stomach and the sides of her breasts, he bit at them gently so they were a bit harder and her breath became heavier. He ran her belly over with the tip of his tongue to her belly button before sucking it into his mouth and kissing his way back to the juncture between her legs.</p> <p>Jakob's mouth moved slowly up her leg. Her smell was heady and he kissed his way from her knee up the inside of her thigh, stopping briefly on her mound before bringing his mouth to kiss her outer lips.</p> <p>Jakob's tongue parted her lips making her moan softly. He slowly lowered his head and slid his wet tongue over her lips and inside. He slid it inside her slowly, drawing out her slick juices.</p> <p>When Jakob moved his fingers into her, he found her clit and started to flick it softly. She moaned and squirmed. He kissed his way back down her body taking his time savoring her taste and aroma. She tasted of honey with a bit of salt added to it.</p> <p>Jakob felt her thighs tighten as he licked her and she knew he was as hungry to be with her there as she was to be around him.</p> <p>For all the passion she had felt earlier with him in bed, this was different. It did not seem like the first time she had been with a man with his clothes on. She felt safe and protected by him. She felt the fire of pleasure she had been suppressing start to grow and as she started to become accustomed to him, she found her pleasure rising at the pleasure of being with him.</p> <p>Her excitement was rising and her breathing was getting faster. Jakob knew he was doing the right thing by bringing her to a climax, he felt her juices were dripping from her. Jakob felt her body bucking as the peak approached and he slowed his tongue to tease her clit. He felt her thighs tighten around his neck and heard her sighing loudly as she came, the pleasure of her orgasm hitting deep within her.</p> <p>Jakob stood up and kissed her with tongue tasting her mouth, enjoying the taste of her with the other man who had just made her feel so wonderful, this was so special and he knew it would be special for both of them.</p> <p>As Jakob led her to the front, she felt his hard cock press gently between her legs. He lifted her hips off of the seat and turned her to face him on the bed.</p> <p>"Do you know what I am going to do to you as we did tonight?" He asked softly.</p> <p>She nodded her agreement as he kissed her gently.</p> <p>"You are going to be with me, the only way you will be will be with that cock that's been inside of your pussy. And you aren't going to be on your back, you will remain where you are. You are going to feel me enter you from behind again and we will begin nowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
