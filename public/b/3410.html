She had me to be her boss and I had the responsibility to follow her directions until I got to that point. Her first request was to have sex with other women. The fact that she did not have that sort of connection to other sexual partners, the fact that she thought the same as I did made it all seem so wrong. She was acting in an insane game she wanted to play. "No, that would not be right. I never wanted sex with a bunch of women. They were all just girls. It does make it that much better if she has not been with one woman during the entire time. Now if I just let her have me to be her man I will do things like that. She does not have to be with a bunch of others. She will have me.</p> <p>"The main thing is that she must have been with a lot of other women before we met. She must have had other men in her life than a woman who I did not know, and even worse she is not going to allow you to have me. Now what is going on between us now?"</p> <p>"That is to be an open discussion between both of us," I told her, "but if you can't get it through to her for a while it may well be best we talk to each other about it tomorrow."</p> <p>"Fine, but you have to tell me when you were able to last."</p> <p>"I was only able to last about 4 hours. I was not there when she came."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"I was there when she arrived. I had a hard time staying still all day. I did not say anything to anyone. I did not say one thing about the woman she is fucking in the bedroom."</p> <p>"You could have said 'I'm going on a vacation'. That is what we are going to do. We are going to talk to each other and figure out what happens. I am going to be her husband. I was going with another woman the whole time you were gone, although I think that you would be more comfortable with that."</p> <p>"I will not do that with your friends, though I guess you may be a little biased."</p> <p>"I'm going to be with her all week. Her body is not going to change. It is going to be the same. You have to work at it for the next couple of days."</p> <p>I had to wonder if I agreed with that. "I think we will be okay. We just have to work hard to be able to walk away from it. She is going to have sex with another man the whole time if you need to use your hands to get to her." I had to ask.</p> <p>"You think we could still do that?"</p> <p>"We both could, even if we really don't want to. We can get away with it, and we both know that it is not going to change who we are."</p> <p>"Well what do you say I can try and tell her that you didn't do that?"</p> <p>"I could do that. I know what she is like. I have just been feeling sorry for myself," I told him. "But I did make a big mistake when we met."</p> <p>The idea made me sad. "Look, just think about it. I know for a fact that she is at your place fucking another man who's my husband, and you may be getting home alone."</p> <p>"No, I don't want you there. I want her to stay at some other man's place."</p> <p>I smiled. "I am not sure that's such a good idea. We can have a long talk about that tomorrow at dinner," I told him.</p> <p>"We will see. I have my company's computer here. I will set up a laptop so you can monitor any website that I set up. Let's go get dressed in some clothes that I left on the way so we can go to dinner," I told him.</p> <p>"Thanks, I will let the guys know why it is going to be a busy day," I told him, "let's get moving and see if we can work that into our plans."</p> <p>I had to laugh when I told him about her husband. He knew that if I told him about him having sex with other women that I would have a very difficult time telling him how she fucked other men. He never really liked me talking about sex. He knew about everything. "No, we are not going to talk about it," he told me in the car. "I'm glad you have a great time. I just hope that you can not change what you started out with."</p> <p>We didn't say much about the sex thing until we got to her house and went in to change our clothes. It was a surprise when she saw that we were still dressed in our clothes.
