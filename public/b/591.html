"No, I don't think so," I answered. "But, I'll try it. You're right, they don't seem to be able to tell me what to do. But, I think I can handle an experiment."</p> <p>"What sort of experiment?"</p> <p>"It's a lot more complicated than your idea. They're trying to figure out if the egg can actually produce cum."</p> <p>"What about the egg being completely different? If it were a real guy, would the same thing actually happen?"</p> <p>"They do, but, they don't have enough data to back it up. So, you're right, there are some things that would probably not have happened to anyone else. And I can't help thinking that this might be the best way to try it."</p> <p>I could feel the tears coming again. I knew that, but it was different than before. That's what I said.</p> <p>"What do you think?" He asked innocently. He put his arms around me, holding me. I couldn't look at him, but I tried to kiss him. He pulled away and took a step back.</p> <p>"Just take a moment and think about it," he whispered. I leaned in and gently kissed him. His lips were soft, but they were hard. He put his hand on my cheek and pulled me to him, pulling me closer and pressing me against him. He kissed me with the passion of a man he didn't even know, and then he pulled away, a little surprised. I felt like I was about to give in, but knew that wasn't the right option.</p> <p>I turned around and walked into the bathroom. I started stripping naked. It took a special girl to have this confidence in herself and her self-assurance, and I felt like an exhibitionist. This way, no inhibitions, no fear, I felt like a girl. I pulled my thong off and pulled on the stockings for a few seconds, then I looked in the mirror and started combing out my hair. I don't know why I did it, I guess, but I decided to do it anyway and it didn't take me long to figure out that my hair looked better, which made me feel good. I pulled on my bra, then got off the stool and walked into the shower. As I washed myself, I thought about what I could do next. If anyone could give me that kind of power, I'd be a porn star.</p> <p>I'd do something I had never done before, but then again, I'd never met anyone who was so willing to do stuff like this. But, maybe if I knew the guy, I'll think about it, and then write up the idea.</p> <p>I closed my eyes and went outside on the balcony with my legs spread and my hands pressed into the water. I stepped beneath the waves and let the water lapped around me. Then, I looked behind me and saw the man who'd just made this happen.</p> <p>He pulled me down on the wet tile floor and pulled my legs apart, lifting them to his shoulders so he could slip the tip of the tip of his cock into my pussy. I was ready for that!</p> <p>I felt his warm shaft slowly disappear into me, then slowly pull back out, the full circumference of his cock pulling me open to the full width of him. He picked up the pace, going deeper with each stroke. He pulled up on my legs and held my knees together. He slid back away from me and began slowly fucking me. I moaned, and he reached forward to my throat, holding my neck while thrusting himself in and out of my body. I moaned and whimpered on every thrust.</p> <p>The man behind me moved his hands up to my tits and squeezed my nipples, twisting them and pulling them sharply. His fingers dug into my shoulders and his palms pinched my breasts roughly, twisting them just a little, pulling on my nipples, twisting each one with his thumbs.</p> <p>I looked back, into the other man's eyes, and I watched as he looked at me with an intense look in his eyes, the passion there clearly on his face. I moved back into him, meeting the thrusts. He brought his hands down to my hips, pulling me tight into his body. I felt our bodies grinding against each other, becoming one body.</p> <p>I turned around and bent over the tile floor, my ass in the air and my head in the water. I felt my pussy being fucked by a man I just met this afternoon. I felt my clit being pinched. I felt my pussy being licked and sucked by a mouth that was expertly working on my pussy.</p> <p>I looked down at myself, between the water and his thrusting cock. I stared at my asshole andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
