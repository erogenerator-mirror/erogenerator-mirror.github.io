"We have a few more things we need to do."</p> <p>Amy looked disappointed, but I knew she would get a much better response on all of them. I reached down and grabbed a pen and paper to write something on. "Here, make me a copy."</p> <p>"No! That’s not necessary, let’s have lunch!" I said quickly, as I started to get up to take out the food. I turned around again and was about to grab a plate when Amy spoke up. "Why don’t you just put your shirt and jacket on? It’s a little cold." I took a box of the same kind of food I had set to a nearby table. "This might bring out the taste of things in me", she added, as she sat herself down at the table. "I think I might really like this." She leaned back and began rubbing her arms up and down her body. "I’m going to keep it on for today until I go back to school. Then I’ll come back down in the morning. You’d think I would’ve stopped for a couple hours. You know what I mean?" I just gave her a shrug and a look. "Don’t worry, I won’t let you up until I leave. Now, how about we order?"</p> <p>"That sounds like a good idea to me." Amy nodded and went to make her order. This was her house, but there I was, alone with her again. I took my own plate and threw down my own plate, then sat back down to try and read. I was having a hard time paying attention because Amy was always there. We had always joked about her not going out to the local restaurants. Now here we were, having our food off of her list, and having her sit alone as she was. I could tell by her movements that she was going to go back to watching TV soon once she got home.</p> <p>After dinner, we both decided to head home. She made me coffee and we sat side by side on the sofa. "I got so used to you calling me up here. You’ve grown into a beautiful woman now." She said as she handed me my own cup. I sat the cup down on the table and held her hand. "Amy, you have no idea how much I'm enjoying our chat." She smiled and leaned in to kiss my hand. "What are you all smiles right now, and what was that on that computer in the room?" I just stood there and gave a shy laugh. "I could almost hear it."</p> <p>She reached down and slowly pulled my shirt up, revealing a nice, round taut belly and a very tight, toned ass. Her hands slowly and gently caressed my arms where I usually couldn’t touch my own body. Finally I turned her around, pressed her against a wall and began kissing her lips softly. Her hands were running up and down my sides with a sure feeling on the top of each of them. After we were done kissing, she began pushing against my front. I quickly pulled her shirt out of her pants and started to slowly undo her bra. "No no, not yet." I stopped and looked at her for a moment. "You're going to have to help me." I put her hand in my lap, which was wet with her juices. "Open it". I did and as she pulled out a very nice, large, thick black nipple, she leaned forward and placed it right on my lips. I put my hands on her hips and gently rocked them back and forth. Amy’s nipples were now rock hard, and protruding very nicely through the thin fabric of her bra. I leaned in close and ran my tongue around the nipple, while one of her hands ran up my back. I could feel the warmth of her hands on my shoulders, my chest and my thighs which were almost covering hers.</p> <p>I slowly pulled of her bra, giving her nipples a gentle tug before pulling them back into the fabric. Amy’s hands came down and put the material in one hand, and began pulling up and down and back and forth. "There, now we can start the process." She grinned and ran her hands up my belly to my neck and shoulders. As she leaned in a bit more, her tongue and lips found the other nipple and began lightly licking around it. I felt how her lips moved ever so slightly. Amy’s hands began to rub up and down my back again, getting closer and closer to my hard dick which I was still keeping inside my pants. Amy turned around, and this time, she put her back to me.
