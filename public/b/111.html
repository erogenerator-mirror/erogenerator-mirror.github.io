You have this wild look about you and everyone can see the look in your eyes. I could stay a whole week. If I wanted to I could sleep in your room."</p> <p>"You know you look good in it and I love sleeping in it," I told him.</p> <p>"I was beginning to enjoy the view and didn't expect you'd be there."</p> <p>"I had a feeling you'd enjoy being in that room," I smirked. "I also like to talk with you in general before we go any farther."</p> <p>"If I wanted to talk to you in the hotel room right now would I?" he asked still smiling.</p> <p>"You could talk to me some how," I teased him. "Or better yet... take a good, hard look at what you can find out in my room."</p> <p>I saw the look pass his face and his fingers start to move up and down his cock. My pussy was so wet he had an almost painful look. I moved my hand down and started to rub my clit. After only another half-step I felt the first signs he was about to get off. I looked over at the open door of the bathroom and realized he'd gone outside to check the temperature. I knew better than to stay outside in the room. I was getting very excited and wanted to feel it.</p> <p>"You'd like to see me right now," he teased, staring right at the opening to my cleavage. His fingers sped up and his face dropped lower. I watched his lips go tight and when his tongue came out I could feel his breath making contact with the soft skin of my stomach. I let my hands do the lifting and he just kept going down.</p> <p>"Oh my God," I moaned. "You're driving me nuts with those fingers and mouth. It's almost too much, but I want more. I want you inside of me."</p> <p>"I know," he said and started to pull down his boxers. "I want to do more than just touch you there. I want to smell you right here."</p> <p>I let the tip of my tongue slide against his neck softly. Our eyes locked for several seconds and I saw his lips kiss me once. I was about to say something but then he was looking directly at me and I could tell his hands went down to my breasts as if afraid to touch where they touched. He was pinching my nipples hard which just turned me on even more. I wanted to just rip my panties off just as he did, but it would have been worth it to see this reaction from him too.</p> <p>His hand had already gone to my waist. He lifted me up and started to run my hands up and down his hard shaft. I let my long nails slide over his balls as he moved me around in front of him. The feel of my legs around him was amazing. The feeling of the hardness in between was as erotic as anything I had ever experienced. I slid my hands under his shirt and he lifted his hips as I felt his fingers slowly reach around to unbutton my shorts and pull them down. His cock popped free from his boxers causing me a moment of panic and his fingers left my panties and I just let out a soft moan.</p> <p>"Your legs are so sexy," his husky voice breathed into my ear.</p> <p>I just opened my legs a little to let him have his way with me. I heard the zipper go down on his pants and was so turned on I knew it'd be safe to say I was going to cum any minute. His hard cock almost popped out of his pants when he was in his boxer shorts and I gasped. He had one hand on my stomach and the other was holding me up so that it would make the whole thing look even better. With his cock standing straight up I could feel it against my thigh. It was so long that it was almost tickling and I thought I might just do one last thing... if I could just get it inside me. The thought that his cock was hard didn't even faze me.</p> <p>"I think we can definitely get there," he warned.</p> <p>He took a step forward and kissed me again. It didn't take my mind off my need to be fucked by him for I felt his hard cock sliding inside me. A smile crossed my face as he held me up. My breasts were crushed inside and he was looking down at me as if I were one of the most beautiful sights. I loved it when he made me have orgasms and I was really enjoying it, but at this point it was the most erotic feeling I'd ever had. The feeling of him inside of me was making me want more. After a very long kiss I just wanted to hold him close and feel him filling me up.
