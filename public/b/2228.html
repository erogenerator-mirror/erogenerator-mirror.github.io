I'm ready for it too, I've been on my feet for hours now."</p> <p>She laughed. "You look amazing, baby. So damn hot." Then she turned the stove on and ran her hands slowly over her body. She looked so amazing standing there in only her bikini bottoms.</p> <p>She stopped for a moment. "I think I love this bikini!" she said, laughing. "It looks really nice on you, isn't it? I got it for an anniversary gift from my ex-husband, he used to always think I'd look sexy in it. Now, I've tried it on more than once, and I have to admit, I feel good about it." She giggled nervously.</p> <p>"That's it? I thought you thought it looked beautiful." I said.</p> <p>She laughed nervously. "Of course I've tried it on in front of you... but, you never looked at it like that... you just made sure you looked good." She chuckled again.</p> <p>I laughed too. "Well, you look good, pretty damn sexy for someone who doesn't have a stitch on. How is that sexy?" she said, a hint of a smile on her lips. "Wow, you really are sexy, don't you, you know that?" she asked, now standing next to me wearing her bikini top.</p> <p>I reached behind my head, and pulled my hair back, letting it fall and give my eyes a bit of a tint. Then, I looked up to her.</p> <p>"Like what you saw?" I whispered in her ear. "Wow, you look great!"</p> <p>She reached out her hand and gently caressed my cheek. "Thank you! So, I'll tell you what. If you're sure you're ready, you can wear this. It looks great on you. It feels so damn good on you, doesn't it? You can put your top back on, too."</p> <p>"You're not really trying to be anything more than that, are you? You know I don't usually wear that bikini unless I have it, you know. You're going to have to ask." I teased.</p> <p>She leaned in, and kissed me. "That's my girl! You're in for a REAL treat tonight." Then she kissed me again, and left. I didn't know what to think, and it was fun, but I knew it might not be an "all you can do" night.</p> <p>The sun was beginning to come up, and I had to get up. That's when I heard the noise of the house phone ringing. I got up myself, and went upstairs. I answered it, and a few minutes later was on the phone again, "Hello..." it was a very excited voice.</p> <p>"Mornin, hi!"</p> <p>"Hey... it's me, Jani. Where ya been? I thought I'd send you the news on the boat!"</p> <p>"Yeah, it's been a crazy day, actually. This is a great surprise! You're the greatest!"</p> <p>"What do you think?" she said, still giggling nervously.</p> <p>"Damn. I've never been so excited."</p> <p>"Well, I'm happy for you."</p> <p>"What did you hear? Oh my!" she said laughing. "It's so good to hear you happy. You shouldn't listen to such a silly speech just to get your rocks off... you know, I don't think I could've done it that well. What's the occasion?"</p> <p>"Just talking. Can't we talk about anything now? Just listen to me about my trip."</p> <p>That didn't answer her. We talked for a few moments, then she said, "That's it, I'm on my way over now. Talk to me over the phone, okay?"</p> <p>"See you soon!" she said, and hung up the phone. I put my hand on my arm, and thought. I knew who I was dealing with. That's when I heard, "Are you okay, sis? Are you alright?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm fine, just been a little out of practice, you know what I mean?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, I can tell. What brought me over here today?" she asked.</p> <p>"Well... I got some really good stuff... from a guy from my church, and he sent me some nice pictures. Just the stuff we were gonna do. This picture, too, was nice. I wish I had some of you and me on it. I kinda got pretty worked up, thinking about how much I'm gonna love you and what you're gonna do for me."</p> <p>"Wow... do you still think about me like that?" sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
