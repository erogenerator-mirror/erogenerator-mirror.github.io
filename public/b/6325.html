I asked.</p> <p>She pulled up and looked in my eyes "Well, I do remember...I was just..." She took a slow, deep breath. I got up off the bed and knelt beside her again. "I don't remember it really...I just can't remember my name..." That thought sent a chill through my body. I could see how her thoughts changed the next moment, and what she was thinking about me.</p> <p>"Wait...what about you, the little fucker?" She asked with what was usually a joking tone of voice.</p> <p>I shook my head as I answered "I'm just a little...I don't remember a thing. He just...huh...I don't even remember his name, I just feel kind of like I did back then..." I wasn't going to say that out loud. She smiled, and pulled her pants up for me.</p> <p>I leaned towards her, and felt her hands pulling at my shirt. "Oh...I'm flattered, no doubt about that..."</p> <p>Without a word, I pulled her to the edge of the bed and leaned down to kiss her. As our tongues danced with each other in the darkness, she grabbed my hand and pressed it against her bare breast. She ground her body against mine, trying to get into my pants without pushing my head away. By now, my cock had sprung to life again, and it brushed into the small space between her thighs. She moaned into my mouth. I slid my hand down to her, trying to feel her naked skin beneath the material of her clothes. I could feel her warmth through her thin underwear. I rubbed my finger tips against the fabric for a moment, making her moan again. By now, I was breathing hard, and I didn't want to go into my work to make her cum yet. Just as I thought she might give out on me, she broke the kiss, and said.</p> <p>"You're such an ass I never liked you..." She said after a long pause.</p> <p>I thought for a moment before answering. "I'm sorry." I responded.</p> <p>"What?" she asked puzzled. I pulled her in close to me, and kissed her nose before pushing her panties down her legs. I began to rub myself through the cloth of her underwear, pressing firmly against her. She was soaking wet and hot, and she grabbed my hand at the wrist and pushed it inside of her. "Don't you mind this, Brad?" she whispered, looking me in the eye. She pulled away from my mouth, and I felt her legs spread wide open. She moaned as I slipped just the tip of my finger, and then slowly pushed it into her. She lifted her head to look in my eyes, and I saw her smile. She was so wet, and she took my entire finger into herself. She pulled my hand away from her clit, and grabbed my cock, and guided me inside. As she worked her clit back and forth with my thumb, and my finger in her, she let out the most erotic moan I'd ever heard in my life.</p> <p>I had to stop what I was doing. She wouldn't let me put my cock in her. She pulled away from kissing me, and told me to go back over there and get the hell out of her room. "You know," she said slowly, and pushed me back roughly towards the stairs, "if you fuck me like that every day, every time we get home, you won't get to fuck me again..."</p> <p>"You're wrong!" I said, and I grabbed her leg and pulled on it as I moved up towards her. She stopped in front of me, grabbed my cock, and pulled it into her. As I slid inside her, she squeezed my cock around it, and began to rock back and forth. Her face moved towards me, and I saw her eyes lock on with lust. She rubbed her body with determination, looking into my eyes, before she lowered herself onto me. Once more, we moaned with the intensity of the moment. I felt her fingers inside of me, and she began to rub her clit with more urgency. I pulled her off of me, before burying my mouth on her breast again. I began to slide my cock in and out of her, using her juices as my lubricant. "Ahh...baby...baby...please..." She was getting louder now, and started to breathe hard through her nose. "OH...OH...OH god...I'm...mmmmm...so..." I heard her let out a long sigh, and her eyes began to roll back into her head. I felt her vagina begin to tighten around me, and she began to gyrate upon me. "Cum...cum...cum in me...cum in me now..."
