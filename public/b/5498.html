I put the phone away and got up to go to take a shower, and then walked back into the shower, turned on the TV and went to bed.</p> <p>I woke about half an hour or so later and lay there looking at the clock. It was 7:00 am I was still in bed with the covers pulled up to my neck. I turned over in the bed and looked at the clock. It was 1:30 am.</p> <p>What a shock I felt when I saw that time. It was already about 8:00 am I'm sure. How had it gone so quickly?</p> <p>We always sleep naked, but we always take baths at the same time. So I figured the shower was probably the next best thing.</p> <p>This night the water was still running. I took my shower and decided to put on the shower clothes I have and then went and got in bed.</p> <p>I was about 10 minutes before I heard the sound of my wife calling out. "Honey is that John?"</p> <p>When she answered 'Yes' it was a little while before she got out of the shower. I got in bed and started to read.</p> <p>I do love you. You know that right?"</p> <p>"Yes"</p> <p>"I am sorry this happened last night, but I never meant to get into that situation and cheat on you. I have never done anything like that."</p> <p>She sounded like she was crying and she wasn't in the mood to be crying, so she said, "No I didn't cheat. We never even kissed like this. It happened, I never have before."</p> <p>She paused for a second and said, "This might have been the worst thing ever. I know I'm old fashioned and I know no one would believe me if I told them that we were just lying around in bed doing nothing at all."</p> <p>I didn't know what to say. The truth was, it wasn't all that great a lie. The fact that we have spent the last few years together is just as good a lie.</p> <p>She continued, "But when I first made the suggestion I thought we might try to see if our marriage could survive if I were only willing to try. I was afraid of what else might happen if I was too old fashioned. But once I made the suggestion I felt a whole lot better about myself."</p> <p>She paused again for a second and then continued, "I still get scared sometimes. This thing doesn't have that much to do with making love. But it didn't have to change very soon. I loved you very much. And it was all my fault because I have been having a hard hold on you since the first time we made love."</p> <p>She paused again and was quiet for the longest time before she finally said, "I was scared we would lose you too. You know we shouldn't be doing this, it would just ruin everything. Besides, maybe our marriage is already done."</p> <p>She paused for a second and then she said, "It might have worked if I was just honest with what was really bothering me. But at the same time I just felt like we had to take a chance and if anything happened to make it better I just had to come clean.</p> <p>"It is still bothering me. I feel like we will never be together again. I still don't know what it is I feel that yearning for."</p> <p>Just before she ended her sentence I reached over and put my hand on her soft tummy and asked, "How much do you love me?"</p> <p>"I love you but you know that. I will always love you and want to be with you as much as you are with me."</p> <p>I kissed her. "If my proposal wasn't as fulfilling as I thought it would be then we would both be a lot happier about our marriage than it is right now. Plus with everything that's happened we'll both be happier knowing that you love me."</p> <p>She kissed me again. "I always loved your idea. You know I just don't know if I can handle it any more."</p> <p>I leaned over and kissed her again and held her again. She was still crying for a little while. I was getting really horny myself, I was thinking about all the things I wanted to share with her while lying next to her, but I didn't want to take the time. We hadn't had any sex last night and I knew I could take much more with this little adventure we had together.</p> <p>She cried again when the kiss broke and she fell right into my arms. Her head was on my chest. I held her there for a few moments and then reached down toward her breast.</p> <p>I could feel her nipple getting harder with my hand and I slowly took her nipple between my thumb and forefinger. I caressed it gently and as she started to make tinyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
