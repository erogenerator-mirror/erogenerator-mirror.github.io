We have some kind of a date in a short term apartment complex.</p> <p>"This is fantastic, but where are we going?" she asked.</p> <p>"Somewhere romantic," I answered, but this time it came out as an "I can only have one drink, and my food is on the porch!"</p> <p>"Honey, this sounds romantic," she insisted, smiling.</p> <p>We arrived a bit later than in our first date. We picked the place because we knew we weren't going to come up to the door from a hotel. We didn't know where to begin, but neither of us really cared. We stood in front of the door and let the air rush into our lungs. Her breasts felt so smooth and full... "This is a great place to live," I thought to myself, as I took her hand and pulled her to me. My erection, which had been semi-erect, was now fully erect, pressing its way through her dress.</p> <p>We kissed slowly and passionately as our hands caressed each others bodies. My cock felt good against her tummy and it felt hard enough to get into her pussy...I wanted to take her right there but she pulled back saying: "Wherever you'd like. We'll have more drinks if I go back to my apartment so do the same. Now get me the door. I've had two glasses of wine and I have some wine in my car."</p> <p>We walked through the door hand-in-hand. "The bedroom looks beautiful," I said. She looked at me over her glasses and agreed with a smile and a small nod.</p> <p>As we walked out onto the patio toward the pool we couldn't keep our hands off each other. We walked to one of the patio lounges and we lay down in front of the lounges. I ran my hands up her thighs, along the inside of her thighs and she looked up at me and smiled.</p> <p>"I was hoping you shaved your legs," I said breathily.</p> <p>She smiled again and I started to unbutton her dress. With a flourish I lifted the bodice off of her shoulders and tossed it towards herself. Her beautiful breasts were large and pink, capped with small brown nipples and her large brown areolas were large and pink as well. Her areolas were large with small brown areolas also, as per her instructions, large and darker than the rest of her breast. Her areola were hard and puckered, her nipples standing up from beneath the dark pink areolas. As I unbuttoned her dress and slid the zipper down she lifted her hips and pulled the gown off of her. As she sat in the lounger, I leaned in and kissed her nipples and gently sucked each one. "Oh, that's nice!" She moaned before sitting up to kiss me again. "You are so thoughtful," she said.</p> <p>I kissed her again, feeling a rush of excitement that I wouldn't want to leave this evening. I unbuttoned her dress all the way and she stepped out slowly. She sat back on the lounger, turned her back to me and reached behind to slide the strap off of her shoulder. My eyes were riveted as they watched every movement of her slender, toned arm. Once the strap was off of her shoulder, her dress dropped slowly to the front of her body and I had a nice glimpse of the nakedness of her beautiful tits. Her nipples were as large as I'd imagined, just like hers were...and so hard. She reached behind and undid her bra first. We were both staring at her breasts, her nipples were pink and as I was admiring her luscious breasts they were standing up majestically as well. I reached up to caress them and took a nipple between my thumb and finger...gently and gently...while watching her face. I could see her lips moving as she moaned softly. She held one breast in each hand and leaned her back a bit. I kissed back and forth my tongue gently and slowly from the bottom of her nipple right to her erect nipple that looked so different than her nipple the first time. I kissed and caressed her nipples as they grew hard and hard and became more and more sensitive as I caressed her breasts. Her nipples were so hard they almost poked through the material of her dress. I kissed them again, and slowly slid the thin material down over my head so they fell away and revealed her shaved pussy.</p> <p>I turned her over toward me and kissed her deeply as our hands explored each other's bodies. She lifted her ass and reached for my hard cock. As our kiss grew more passionate, her hand squeezed it as if she was afraid to touch it. She stroked me with one hand stroking me the other hand to herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
