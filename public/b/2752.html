He wasn't getting what she needed, he was getting what she needed... he was just not getting what she needed in the sack... he had a way to get what he wanted but not necessarily what he wanted. His body still tingling and tingling. He wanted to grab my hair but instead he sat, holding me in his lap. His hands still caressing each other and his cock still fucking her. He was a very gentle lover and I got to watch as he did himself. She didn't speak because she wanted her husband.</p> <p>I watched, almost delirious with the moment I had never felt before. It was beautiful but for different reasons. For the first time in my life my husband wanted to make love to me. He wanted to do things that he had never done... to show her that he was a man, that he could be with her the way he wanted to be. I was helpless to do much but watch. My heart was breaking but I loved him, even if it was pain or torture. I had only known him for a few hours but I wanted to do more.</p> <p>He moved his hips and I watched... I saw him do it for a while but I don't think he even noticed it. This time he wanted to feel what it would feel like. To make love with her just so he could make an impression on her. He wanted to make her feel what she was feeling, to feel her. The way he had just made love to her. His hands held me again and he kept moving in and out. My mind was so filled with her scent and his words when he said it... she just smelled so good as he fucked her. He was enjoying this, I felt it. I wanted to be part of it, to enjoy it... I felt so... in love.</p> <p>And her hands felt good too... She was really in heat, very, very, excited. She was his. I watched. I saw the contrast in colors, not just the color but also in the angle. He had her body; we were all connected and she was making me feel good. It was hot... I wanted to stay there, see this and, knowing I was watching, I could do that as well as have that watch for the rest of the night.</p> <p>He had moved his hands on to her and I saw him gently stroke her. He was moving with her and they were fucking. I saw him slow his stroke, not to push too hard, just a gentle grind and her moans. It gave me an idea I had never had before, the realization she loved him this much. I started to wonder that I too, was in love.</p> <p>I was so hard and I wanted her... to come and scream her body off, to push back at him. He had been stroking her for what seemed like forever and I was worried that I was going to cum. He told her to cum again, to make this last. He did that for quite a while, just the same way she had done for me. Then, he turned around, still fucking me and bent over and sucked my cock back into her warm mouth. She was sucking and moving her tongue up and down my shaft. I was so incredibly horny I almost came but I was trying to concentrate on the sensation. I felt her take my cock out of her mouth and she held it right in front of my face. I knew I couldn't cum but I didn't care. He held me against the side of my face and then he put his cock in front of my mouth. I wanted to suck but I couldn't. I was going to explode. This time I wanted it; I wanted to taste his cock. I needed to suck and lick it to get it right again so that when I had it right again it wouldn't be too small or too soft.</p> <p>He moved behind me and I heard his cock going into me. I felt his fingers part my wet lips and then felt his head go into my ass. As my breath came back down I could see how his cock went into and through my lips and into my body.</p> <p>He took what he wanted and fucked me, taking the time I liked to think about what she did. He fucked me. I felt him. Her hands and his cock going in and out of me. He was very deep and it got me so hot. I had one of his hands on me, holding onto me as he fucked me. My fingers were still in her pussy... I was trying to stay connected to her, wanting her not to move anymore. We were both in a way connected by something. It was a connection. A feeling... a connection. It was real, real good and I wanted it to last, wanted to fuck her until she couldn't move any more and then to get her off, as much as she wanted me to fuck herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
