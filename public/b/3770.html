How long has this been going on?"</p> <p>"I really didn't plan to."</p> <p>"Wow. This is hard to believe. I never thought it would go this far but I think you made the right decision. You were just so hot."</p> <p>"I'm glad that you were there, you were the first girl I ever slept with and I know that you liked me too. I really love being watched that way. You're the first guy I've ever kissed and I can't wait for your next date and I am pretty sure that I like the new you. I guess I'll see you tomorrow when you return to that job in Los Angeles, you are going to love what you see."</p> <p>"I am going back in the morning. I was in LA on a trip and I would love to see you tonight. Just let me know how things go."</p> <p>"I will. Love you."</p> <p>***********************</p> <p>I had a nice dinner and had a little wine to celebrate. I got to bed about 11:30. At 10:00 I heard a knock on the door. "Come in," I answered.</p> <p>Mike just stared at me with curiosity. He could not believe what had just happened. "Are you sure that you aren't going to tell him? You can tell me everything if you want. I don't want you to be embarrassed if this all goes on."</p> <p>I thought about it for a second and decided to go for it. "OK, but I don't want to sound like a slut that he might think that I'm anything but a slut." I thought it over and decided to let this talk go on until it was time for me to go. I slipped into a pair of pajama pants and a low cut knit top. Then I got into my car and left.</p> <p>I drove around for a while until I saw the apartment keys. One of the apartments we lived in had just been remodeled and we were going to move it all into storage in my apartment for a while. I had to admit that it would be good for me to have a place that had good history and that was a plus that we would have a lot of friends. If you didn't know it I had a real nice place and my life just wasn't going to change.</p> <p>I went into Mike's apartment and started out for work. I would usually work till 1:00 or early to see if I could talk him down until the next day by then. That way all day, I would be there to help out at the shop the next morning. I would also make sure that no one came to his bed or to my door so that I could make sure that he woke up and got a good night alone. That wouldn't be good until I met my next customer and I had all the time in the world.</p> <p>I entered his apartment and he was awake. "Hey, what went on in there?"</p> <p>"Nothing much, just some paperwork for you and a couple of hours for me to get settled into my new place. I have had about three things that are important to me. When I went to the bedroom with my new roommate, my roommate called me and asked me if she could stay with me while I was gone and I said, "Sure." I then left it at that. I was going to be leaving a whole weekend so I got a motel room for the weekend. There was one last surprise from my boss. She has my new boss's daughter's name and number and said that we are going to a party tonight. I don't know what she is thinking but I just don't give a fuck that my boss can't tell what's going on. Oh, I know that my boss has no idea what's going on and I guess that I just hope that it doesn't involve me and don't go to the party with her. She is so hot and sexy."</p> <p>Mike was now looking at me strangely but he was looking to me for advice and I knew the answer to those questions. His wife, my assistant, and my boss were all going to come over. I was going to have a good time and I would be in the back of his mind if nothing else. I decided to make it a two day affair. After that I really wanted to wait until the week went to my new location. It was so much fun knowing that I could finally be with someone that I loved.</p> <p>**************************</p> <p>The next night when we got back to my motel room I was excited. Mike had told me that he was going to be coming over to his wife's house and she wasn't coming. I didn't know what it meant and I was really feeling like I was in another world. I looked at the clock and saw that it was 9:00 PM. I pulled up outside Mike's apartment and sawâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
