I...I'm sorry..." I stammer. "I...I'm just feeling funny inside." I stammer again as she reaches down and starts stroking me. It feels amazing I think as my body starts to tremble again, the tension in my loins building. She looks up into my eyes as she fondles me and slowly rubs her finger on the head of my cock while tracing down the length of my cock, rubbing the precum all around on her finger. She leans forward and takes me in her mouth and I moan again as she slowly sucks on me while holding my cock firmly in her hand. I put my hands on her head, pushing her down just a little, feeling the slight pull of her tongue on my cock, almost making me cum, but not quite. "Oh my god, I'm gonna cum," I groan as the last waves of pleasure run through my body. She feels that same little twitch to her mouth as I cum and she immediately releases me.</p> <p>"Oh god," I gasp. "I haven't cum like that in a long time and you're still not done," I tease her as she stands up and starts undressing me. "No more, no matter the cost," she says, and we both laugh. I slide back on the bed and she climbs on top of me, straddling me again as she guides me into her again, my hands working their way up her body in wonder. I reach up and unbutton her dress. "Please," she moans as I get out the rest of her buttons, "please fuck me," she says, "fuck me with your cock," she says again with another smile, and slowly pushes onto me, impaling herself on me. I gasp at the sudden invasion of me, my body starting to lose its tension, wanting to thrust against her, but instead she leans forward and pulls me onto her and holds herself there while we kiss. "Oh. Oh god," she moans as I thrust into her, "you feel so good." I don't need any more encouragement, and I start thrusting into her, driving more deeply.</p> <p>"Fuck me," she moans, "fuck me harder." And she starts moaning more as the sensations grow and build again, my cock hardening again inside her as I feel the walls of her pussy squeeze against my cock. "God I love this," she says as she starts to moan louder. She starts to pick up the pace and slam herself onto my cock, fucking herself faster, her hands on my chest as she moves down. "Oh god," I groan as her legs wrap around me and I feel her fingers start to rub her clit again. "Oh fuck. Oh my god." She gasps as she feels another orgasm wash over her, and she lets me feel that as she drops onto my chest panting for breath. "God. Oh. I'm sorry." I start to say, to ask, "Is that what you always tell me?"</p> <p>She smiles. "I think you know." She slides off me for another minute and looks at me, "Are you sure, you don't want to make up for all the good times, you know?"</p> <p>"You know?" A surprised look comes to my face. "I've never made up for all those things that I did before," and I think about how I told her about my fantasies during our first encounter about my fantasies being that she was my lover and I started that part of our relationship. I look at her eyes and see that she has noticed too. "Well," she says, "I'm glad you're glad too."</p> <p>"So am I." I reply. "Now let's make love." And she climbs off my body and we lay side by side, looking at each other. "Ready for something new?" she asks.</p> <p>"No. I've only been with a woman once." I say as though I am trying to be the most nonchalant. "This was my first time, wasn't it?" I ask with genuine surprise. She just smiles and leans over to kiss me. "You are so right," she says, "I've felt as though I'd been kissed and taken for granted for ages and never experienced it." She looks at me. "It wasn't so bad after all. I feel so amazing, and, I've never even been with a man like you."</p> <p>"I can't imagine what that is like," I reply. "I have to have you."</p> <p>"No. No no no," she says as she gets up off the bed, "this is me now." We both smile as she climbs back on the bed and lies on her back, her hands on her breasts, and she runs her fingers through her hair.
