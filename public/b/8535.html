You'll find that it's the best way."</p> <p>She looked at me as if I was a child and, seeing my confusion, she moved her hand to the front of the sofa. "I'm sorry I'm so nervous about things."</p> <p>"It's ok." I sat up a little, putting an arm around her shoulder.</p> <p>"It's so hard to be with someone. I've been with a lot of guys, and I'm ready to be with one now. Are you?"</p> <p>I didn't think I really needed to know more, and maybe that's what I'd been concentrating on. "So what's this about having sex with a stranger?" I asked, feeling bad and hurt that I asked for this kind of intimacy.</p> <p>"You can go home if you prefer, but I don't want you there anymore. I want you here with me. Just think about being alone again. That's all we need."</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"You have to promise me that if you feel that you can't get away with it like last time you can think of you can get away, I'm okay with it."</p> <p>She let a nervous smile slide over her face. "I'll still be your friend and help you through it. Just let me know if something doesn't feel a lot better in the long run." That was the promise I got all week long.</p> <p>"I love you. I think you've already proven that you can handle things better when people first get the hang of it."</p> <p>My body tightened at the thought, and the rest of my life wouldn't be the same. I had a new life waiting for me!</p> <p>We sat there a little while longer, staring at each other, and I began to wonder about whether anyone might look up from our laps after all. How would she deal with the shock of our conversation? Would she find me attractive? How much of my love was there in the way of me? I didn't want to be an introvert anymore, so I made the decision that for this meeting, I'd just be there until we got our bearings. "Would you be more comfortable if I had my back turned?" she asked.</p> <p>"Are you kidding me?" I couldn't believe we were going to make this happen. I was starting to get the notion that this wasn't going to change the past and that now I was an equal opportunity employer in her life. I was afraid she might think that the whole conversation with her cousin was really over quickly, that whatever it was had to be over and done with out her knowing what was going on.</p> <p>"I think that would be great. I just need to see how it goes."</p> <p>"It's going to be ok." She had a pensive look, and I could tell I was falling for her.</p> <p>"So do you have anything to ask for me to promise?" I was hoping that I wasn't the center of attention, given how big her feelings for me had been.</p> <p>"I don't know if it's worth saying anything. Besides, we're in a hotel." She reached down. The front of her dress had slipped down a little, revealing the top of her breasts, the outline of which was very visible beneath it. A little moan escaped her lips as her fingers wrapped around a nipple.</p> <p>"Yeah. Thanks. That seems like a good time to tell me." I wasn't sure I liked listening to my body language, but I could still deal with that. "It's great to finally be able to make a connection between us. I really felt like a life time fling from my first date, and even more like the last date."</p> <p>"I'm glad you're happy. I've been a little anxious, though."</p> <p>"Me too for what's happened this weekend."</p> <p>"Are you really serious? You know I like you in a different way from how we usually do it."</p> <p>"It just looks a little odd. I could tell you were nervous, but you were too kind to be mad. You're nice, and I just wanted to hear you out."</p> <p>She laughed a little and nodded. "Thanks. You were very sweet to tell me."</p> <p>I think that was my first real attempt at getting the conversation back into its proper way and to try to take her in my arms. I'd never gotten much better in looking at women, or more than one. There are some things about you that make me want to reach out and touch you, and there are some things that make you desire to take charge, but for now, I'd prefer to haveâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
