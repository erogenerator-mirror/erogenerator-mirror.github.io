"Is it okay if I get a ride?"</p> <p>I looked at him curiously. "You sure? I don't want to run out on you."</p> <p>"No," he said, "it's not that. I know I don't even get a good shot at it. Do you have any idea why I want to go with you?"</p> <p>I shook my head and said, "I don't," with a grin, "I just want to take a chance."</p> <p>He pulled his truck into the driveway and got out. "I'll just walk over to the garage and let my truck do that thing."</p> <p>"Okay," I said, "but it's not all that easy. I'll just go in there and see if I got my key."</p> <p>"I'm sure that thing would be able to handle," he sighed. "But if you really go, I'll hold the doors for you."</p> <p>I gave him a half smile and said, "Sure," and I went in.</p> <p>I walked into the garage and I was immediately rewarded with a beautiful truck. It smelled of cherry wood and the top was red. It was even more beautiful than the other cars that I saw.</p> <p>The thing pulled into the garage and I could see that it was parked inside the garage door. He turned on the big electric lights before closing the garage door. "Oh hell, I should close it, that doesn't look too good," I said, "and there's probably a spare key, or something like that."</p> <p>I was thinking how cute that is. We were standing there in the garage together and I noticed that my hand was starting to rise in my lap. I guess I shouldn't be doing this, but it's what I've been doing for the last week now, I thought to myself.</p> <p>"It's not as though I have anywhere to take it," I said.</p> <p>"What? If I would have brought my own keys here you'd have had to lock it all up yourself," he laughed. "But I was thinking the same thing."</p> <p>"I'm sure that you don't have anything better left to do," I said.</p> <p>"Well, just let me put your key in the slot here and I'll be right back," he said.</p> <p>He walked toward the car and I walked around to the side. I was standing with my back turned to him and I felt my heart start to pound as I looked at his amazing body. "What are you waiting for?" I asked, "I have a date tonight and I want you to be all mine."</p> <p>We both laughed. I walked over and sat it down on the bench outside the garage, leaned back on it and looked up at him. "This isn't a date, is it?" I asked. He shook his head and said, "Oh I don't think so. I would have told you to wait until the night is done before you did anything."</p> <p>"I want you to take me," I said, "and make me a woman, and make me yours." I couldn't believe what I just said. This man was asking me to go out and have him make me come and watch him fuck me.</p> <p>"I'll do anything you want," I told him. Then I added, "Unless it's going to be you who says no, I know this is a one-time deal."</p> <p>He smiled and leaned over to kiss me. "Anything you want, sweetheart," he sighed. And we both fell asleep in each other's arms.</p> <p>I got up and went to the main bedroom and got out of my clothes, and lay on the bed naked. It took a few minutes to get my breath back and I finally drifted off to sleep.</p> <p>The next morning I woke up first. I remembered what I had done the night before and could not believe what happened last night. I still hadn't spoken to him, or even told him that it was okay. I really felt that this was what I had wanted; that it was the right thing to do. I decided to just do what I had felt and go with the flow. It took a couple of minutes, but when there was nothing to do, I just went straight to the bathroom and washed my face, and then I washed my face again and dried it with a towel. I got back into the bedroom and saw that John had already tossed on a robe and left the room. He was still there when I got in. He was still fast asleep, but I felt like he had come on to me. I looked down at the door frame behind me, and I smiled.</p> <p>I had no idea how I was going to finish what I had startedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
