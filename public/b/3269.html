I was still holding my own. I closed my eyes and let her kiss me deeply. My hand left her left breast and traveled down to her abdomen and a single touch of that magic finger made me moan. She took the hint. She slipped my hand between her thighs and slowly pulled away from me.</p> <p>She reached up again, and this time she gently brushed my lips with the tip of her tongue. I opened my mouth just enough to take part of that tongue into hers. Her hands pulled away the towel and she held that small, soft, fleshy body in place. My hand slid down across her stomach and again her thigh. I slid down across her body, pressing the tip of my fingers on her mound. She was soaked! There was a small patch just above her sex that I found difficult to reach, I pushed a finger in gently. I moved my finger up and down, getting wetter and wetter. I found her button and gently rubbed that. Oh, the combination was so sensual!</p> <p>"I'm going to fuck you," I said in a low husky voice. Just then, my dick started to get hard, pressing against my panties. I pushed them both down to the floor and stood there. "I think we are ready," I said quietly. The look on my face only made Eva moan more. She took my hand and helped me up.</p> <p>"Let's shower in the bathroom," I said.</p> <p>We got into the shower together, and I found that she had a perfect body. "Your body excites me," I whispered as I ran my hand over her body.</p> <p>"You always know how to make a girl feel good," Eva replied. With that, she turned and pressed her body up against me and reached down into the water. She pulled away her hands from my body to the shower controls. They rotated until she got us onto the bed.</p> <p>We got out of the shower and went into the kitchen. I picked up some fruit and poured a large glass of juice. I made us a salad. We ate on a couple of plates in a long line. I finished the juice with my body all over Eva's. We talked a mile a night. We talked about the day, our day, our adventures, and what we liked. It was fun.</p> <p>After dinner, we climbed into bed. We both fell asleep in a comfortable embrace.</p> <p>When I awoke the next morning, she was stretched out on her side facing me. I reached up and took the towel from her. I kissed her forehead. It's time for the morning wash-me routine.</p> <p>"How do I look?" I asked, "Your beautiful and sexy. Did you really mean it?"</p> <p>"Did you really mean it?" She asked.</p> <p>"Yeah,"</p> <p>"How did you know I'm beautiful? That wasn't just sexy," she said playfully as she raised her arms, "I was totally serious. I never had such a good time. Did you really think I would say no if I wanted to make love to you after you had done the same things to me with your clothes?"</p> <p>"You know I loved you, and if I were to do the same thing with my clothes, then maybe I would be ready to have you again," I said with a laugh.</p> <p>"That's true," she replied as she pulled the sheet from me and covered us with a blanket. And then she leaned down and gave me a lingering kiss on the lips. She went to the bathroom and closed the door.</p> <p>"I have to get to work in a little bit," she said with a shrug.</p> <p>"If you are done, I will be in the shower with you," I answered as I reached for a washcloth and soap. There were bubbles running down her body from the shower, but we were under a direct spray. There was an urgency in her voice, like that had always been there from the start. I washed her hands and began to wash the shampoo from her hair. I was starting to feel a bit naughty.</p> <p>She was rubbing the shampoo over my shoulders and down my back. Her hands were moving down my back, to my side, and up through my armpits. I found myself starting to enjoy the feeling of her hands on my skin and the soap.</p> <p>"It's not just about my body, but for you it's a lot of pleasure," I said as I turned her around and put the shampoo in my mouth. I washed her up and down every now and then, making sure I was very clean.</p> <p>"You wash up well, you wash well," I said as I reached up behind her and gotâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
