"It's not over Brad."</p> <p>"You're kidding right? She's gone. What about you?"</p> <p>"What's wrong with her? This is her first time!" Beth cried out in anguish. "And what could she possibly want from us! It's like I never gave a damn! She's the hottest girl in school!"</p> <p>As she put the phone down she saw the message and began to panic. She needed desperately to call her parents, but she knew it wouldn't come to that but what did she need? She knew how much she loved her mother as well as father and she wanted to do whatever she could to make that happen.</p> <p>There was no return of phone contacts and she dialed Brad's number and was shocked, no, excited, when he picked up. As he talked on the phone, Beth heard a familiar, rich sound and just as quickly as it started, it stopped.</p> <p>A month of hell waited to be let loose!</p> <p>Chapter 2 The Plan</p> <p>Beth called Brad up and said, "I want to make a phone call! I can't leave this phone up until I'm sure I'm on it!"</p> <p>Brad said, "Well, if we're going to make these arrangements then it's because I want to go to the airport right now. I want an airplane ticket."</p> <p>"No that won't work! No one in the industry is going to give us the air. We'll take our own air!"</p> <p>"Brad I didn't even get to meet her on the plane! Oh my God!"</p> <p>Beth said, "Look, we have to meet somewhere, but I need you to go to your folks and let them know we're having a family get-together to pick up a birthday gift for you. I promise it won't be much later than this week or so, but it's important. They're going to want to go anyway and besides, if I'm going to go with them, I'll have to fly to the airport so to speak as well."</p> <p>"You are so sweet."</p> <p>"Well anyway, you'd better go. I'll talk to you when I get back."</p> <p>Beth hung up her phone so now she was sure she was out. She also hoped that someone at work would come in. When she picked up the car it smelled good. There was a slight sheen of sweat on her chin but she couldn't think of anything else to say except thank God for her friend. She walked briskly into the terminal knowing that everyone was watching her as she ran like bullets. She ran as fast as she could and just as she arrived there was a commotion at the gate. When she had to rush back to the gate the two security guards stood guard to keep her on her toes as tears streamed down her face. She stopped at the gate to take a quick look to make sure she wasn't going to be seen. When she got back to the gate, the security guards were standing guard over her now.</p> <p>"That's not good! What are you doing here bitch!"</p> <p>The two men took off her hat and removed her scarf. As she reached them, they all held her at bay.</p> <p>"You know the protocol, you don't look like a terrorist, you stupid bitch. I'm the security guards and you're my friend. We'll take care of any threats you make."</p> <p>The two men were so forceful in their demands that it brought Beth back to reality. She knew what she wanted right now was to go to a little town but she wouldn't go alone. She didn't want to make anyone else think she was stupid.</p> <p>"You must be the driver. Do you have your vehicle here?"</p> <p>The man pointed to a limo parked across the street and the chauffeur opened it for Beth. She got in and drove away. Just before she was turning the corner she saw the man in the limo staring at her.</p> <p>"Excuse me," Beth asked her in a low-voiced voice.</p> <p>"You can call me Brad but not a friend. I've known you since I was five and remember that."</p> <p>Beth turned the car off and said, "You think I know this man?"</p> <p>"Yes, I do," Brad replied, "and you better call him by the address that was on the front of your license. If they have him for a full couple of days I might as well go and speak to him for that long."</p> <p>"Thank you for that" Beth said.</p> <p>"Not a problem," Brad offered. "He's got a date with his parents in a few days."</p> <p>Beth said, "I'd like to come too."</p> <p>"We don'tâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
