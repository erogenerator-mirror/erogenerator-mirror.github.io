He did not want a permanent relationship, and he did not want children. I saw a look on his face. I felt it and my heart broke. But he smiled, as he told me later. He said that I would be the best choice for the job at hand. I still couldn't believe that we would be together.</p> <p>The next morning I woke up alone in the bed and looked around my apartment trying to decide on a way to make some kind of move.</p> <p>As I had planned, I was home only moments before the alarm went off, waking me. I walked through the living room as I had the first few days before, and my heart sank when it dawned on me that I was not on the couch. No way. I did not love him. I loved Kelly, whom I had found and loved deeply. But I did not fall victim to his feelings and desires as I had the last time I had slept alone.</p> <p>"You look awful, Karen." The familiar voice at my door was soft and warm. I pulled back the covers and pulled my night gown down over my breast and onto my legs. "I'm so sorry," I sobbed.</p> <p>"It feels good," he said, as he came out of the sitting room and walked into the room to say good morning. "You're looking really, really cute tonight. I am so sorry," he continued as he closed the door.</p> <p>"It's OK," I assured him, "I'm just in shock."</p> <p>He stopped walking, turned and stared at me. I could feel his eyes on me, as he turned away, as if looking for something. I was afraid but was too afraid to even look at him. He closed the door again and sat silently on the bed.</p> <p>"That was a weird morning for me," he stated matter of factly.</p> <p>I looked down at his hand, as it slowly crept up the inside of my thigh, up between my legs, under the covers. I could feel my panties beginning to become damp. And then I saw his hand. That, it seems, was a dream he had last night. My insides were on fire, my breath was ragged.</p> <p>"I can't believe we are together," I stammered. I had to explain that it was not a dream and I had always felt attracted to him and that I was attracted to being with him.</p> <p>"That is a nice thought," he said.</p> <p>His hand trailed a finger tip up my left inner thigh and over the material of my panties. I could feel an erection growing within me. "You were looking so beautiful last night," he said.</p> <p>His hand stopped briefly, as if he was unsure where to touch me next. It began to wander up my thigh until it reached my crotch. He began to squeeze my breast, which brought on another surge of orgasmic energy. I was so close to exploding. He broke our gaze and ran his hand underneath my panties. His finger began to brush against my slit. He moved his finger up in small circles over my clit, feeling the engorged bud beneath its surface.</p> <p>"Do you like it that much?" he asked.</p> <p>"This is incredible," I said, almost incoherent with desire. "I cannot describe what it is like to do this."</p> <p>His finger began to move faster and deeper inside me. I was so sensitive that I actually began to moan, and I could feel an intense orgasm begin to rise within me.</p> <p>"I can't feel my hands. Can you hear me?"</p> <p>His finger moved in a rhythm. I was moaning, as my body shuddered with pleasure. I didn't really believe I would be able to handle the pleasure that was coming from my body, but I was now sure that he felt great inside me. All of the sensations were merging into one intense orgasm that radiated out to my entire body. He took his finger and slid it in and out several times, then removed it completely.</p> <p>"Oh, please," I begged. "I need it. I need your finger inside me. I need to feel your big cock inside my body"</p> <p>"Oh," he said, "I can hardly wait. There's nothing here for us. I have to get back to work for the weekend. We have something to share. Come," he said as he turned me onto my back, took my hand, and placed it on his hardness and pulled me back into the living room for our morning kiss. He kissed me so very tenderly I almost did not know what came next. But instead I felt myself being guided toward his body. I felt hands between my legs and knew that this was not his penis. He must have taken his pants down, as I felt his erection pushing against myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
