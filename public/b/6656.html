"How about you and the girls in the mall? Do you have any questions for me?"</p> <p>"I think that we might like it," I said. "But first I want to try out this new toy on us girls, can you show me what's working?"</p> <p>He chuckled. "I think that we can try a lot at the same time."</p> <p>"No, we can't."</p> <p>He took another big swallow of his coffee. "I want you to get on your hands and knees for me." He grinned broadly and moved to the closet that was directly across from the bed. "Get over here," he said. "I want to enjoy your gorgeous ass."</p> <p>I stood up in the middle of the closet and looked over my shoulder. "You know if I can't have that, let me get some toys, too." I turned back around and put my hands back at my sides.</p> <p>Jim laughed. "Yes, you can," he said, and then he reached up to my hair and pulled roughly. I dropped into position, and Jim used a handful of my long and straight blonde hair and pulled me back until my face was sticking up. "You can do this," he said. "But don't you dare come."</p> <p>I shook my head. "No," I said softly, "no, I won't." I was trying to sound brave and assertive, but I didn't really feel that way. The last thing I wanted to do was to disobey Jim. I guess for a while I simply couldn't stand the idea that I might be being unfaithful with another man. He looked up at me, took another sip of coffee and added, "Come on, baby, you know you want to." I turned my head to him. "Yes, I want to. But I won't come unless you do."</p> <p>I was trembling with nervousness—my last experience of this kind of contact had ended several weeks before. Now it was time to back out. "Yes," I said nervously. "I'll do whatever you want, Jim, just let me go back now."</p> <p>Jim leaned back and looked me up and down. "You are an amazing girl, Rachel," he said. "I can't say that I've ever heard a girl say that before."</p> <p>The word 'girl' made me tremble just a bit. "I'm glad that you've noticed," I told him. "If I could go back now, we could have a serious chat about this, and you could talk things out."</p> <p>Jim's eyes widened as he thought back to the way that my face had turned from bright red to pink when he had said it. "Don't you dare try anything at that point." He squeezed my hand and slid his tongue in between my lips, running his warm skin along mine and then pressing his lips to mine and letting me slide my tongue into his mouth. I was very excited. I guess that I'd let him take control, or maybe he enjoyed the power that he suddenly had over me? Whatever the case, it was exciting to be kissed for the last time, and that was the only thing that really mattered anymore. I thought that we should stop at one more cup of coffee—we hadn't had it yet—but, still, I couldn't help myself.</p> <p>As Jim's hands began to explore my body, I decided to stop pretending that I'd like it just like this. I'd be the one making the decisions, I thought. We could decide what to do, what to see with our eyes, what to do. I didn't care about whether we liked each other, or what we wanted to do with each other.</p> <p>"OK," Jim finally broke the kiss and stood up. "There's a shopping bag on the table in the bedroom," he said. "If you want to try it out, you'll need to get naked and take it to the bathroom." He smiled. "No, we've got our little talk to finish, don't we?"</p> <p>I grinned. "Yes, we do," I said. Of course, Jim would need to take my hands and pull them to my sides, and now I was starting to worry that things might be slipping all over the floor and I might not be able to pull them around as I wanted. I took the bag and stepped out onto the bed. Jim took out a box and brought it over to the bed. "That's it," he said, and then, pulling the bag close to him, he took out a few things and set them down on the bed. I saw from his expression that he was almost surprised by something—a surprise he had not expected to—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
