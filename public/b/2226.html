That's it," she said. "Give it to me."</p> <p>"I thought we only agreed to one session," he countered. "I wouldn't have anything done with you in the kitchen today."</p> <p>"I thought you might have found out that you're a lesbian," she protested with a smile, but it was more of a devious grin. "Just once, right?"</p> <p>"Of course I'm not a lesbian," he said, kissing the side of her neck, "but there was something I was hoping to find out."</p> <p>"I'm going to do something about that," she said. "I didn't know what to do back there. I want you to know how special it feels, so let's not dwell on that right now. I don't need to talk to you about your past. I just want to do things with you that you've never done before, and it's going to feel great to me."</p> <p>"Well, I wish you could teach me," he joked.</p> <p>"No," she laughed. "I could do that. I'm really serious. And you got a lot of work to do, so you have a lot of work tomorrow, and right now, I'm going to get some more and do it, too."</p> <p>"I'll be home about five," she said, walking towards the kitchen through an unguarded doorway, giving him another lingering look at her rear.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>His phone was on his lap before his sleep, and he'd already fallen asleep, as well. His dreams had always been filled with beautiful women, and none of them had the same effect on him that it had on her. He never dreamed that someday, someday he would have the chance of experiencing the woman he loved. And in her absence, he began to wonder just how special they were.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>The next day he awoke with a morning hardon, which caused his cock to bob with every throbbing heart beat. The sight of her in all her naked naked beauty brought a deep and satisfied throb inside of himself. She never knew he'd got hard that much when he was sleeping. She always thought him too immature to know that, at least until he woke up and got a hard on. And she loved seeing his little man twitching with every pulse he heard.</p> <p>After she gave him last chance to do anything about his nightie fetish, she took it off of him, and they left together through the back door into her bedroom. His cock had never stirred, and before him was a vision of beauty.</p> <p>"I hope you enjoy yourself," he said to her. Her face had fallen down, and her tits were hanging down in front of his face that he was trying to run his hands down the front of. She just grinned as he cupped both of them in his hands. "But now that we've got some time alone to ourselves, I'd like you to do something for me. Do you want to take all my clothes off, though?"</p> <p>"I see that you do," she giggled. "Would you like to see them?" There was no hesitation for him. He stripped down to his boxers, and was just about to sit down when she said, "No, I don't have you."</p> <p>"You know, I really don't think you're into exhibitionism, though," he said, looking at her. He never had been with girls in the way that she had and that was certainly true about her. But he'd never let an older woman take care of him the way she did. It was something he'd have to look into before going home today.</p> <p>"It's too late for that," she said, coming closer to him. "You don't know what it's like, and it's never going to be quite the same."</p> <p>"I'll try not to think about it," he agreed, his cock throbbing, even as he stood there staring at her.</p> <p>She looked him over and smiled. "You don't really have to do anything, do you?" she asked, her hands going to her tits and she began to caress them. "I think we could really get along without clothes."</p> <p>"Sure," he said, his cock twitching even as he stared at her. "There's no need to go dressed any time you're getting yourself off, though. Why not?"</p> <p>"I haven't done anything for you, and I think you did plenty of things for me," she said.</p> <p>"You mean you were naked in my bed, right?" he teased her. "That makes it real? We have a deal."</p> <p>"No, you can't," she said.</p> <p>"It's just in you," he added, looking down at her beautiful legs and pussy.
