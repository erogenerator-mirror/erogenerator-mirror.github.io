She pulled the shirt from her body and pulled it off, letting her breasts bounce out.</p> <p>"Do you want them to touch?"</p> <p>"No," she said. I didn't even ask what she meant though. "Let me see yours."</p> <p>I moved my hands up the side of her body. I cupped her breasts in my hands, then ran my fingers over her nipples. They hardened. I bent my head forward.</p> <p>Her hair fell over the base of my neck. I leaned forward a little, kissing just above her soft, round tits.</p> <p>My hands reached down and cupped one of her asscheeks.</p> <p>She was holding her ass as I kissed and licked her neck and ears.</p> <p>"Oh yeah," she said.</p> <p>I slid my hands over her ass to caress her cheeks.</p> <p>"Are you wet?" I whispered.</p> <p>"Yes," she said, "so sweet!"</p> <p>Her head fell back and her shoulders opened as I pulled her towards me. With little resistance, I slid my hand between her legs.</p> <p>As her pussy pushed into the palm of my hand, I felt her wetness.</p> <p>"I've been wanting to do this," she said, "Ever since I met you."</p> <p>"And you've been asking me to take you to bed," I said, "and I gave."</p> <p>I moved to kiss her again. Her lips were hot to the kiss, but soft.</p> <p>"Please," she said, "please."</p> <p>In an instant, she kissed me again, then pulled back and looked me in the eye.</p> <p>"No, no, baby, we can't. I really, really want to..."</p> <p>"Mmmm," I said.</p> <p>I kissed her again. My tongue worked her lips and tongue in a smooth, controlled rhythm.</p> <p>I brought my hands up her shirt and touched her breasts. Her nipples were hard. Her tits felt amazing beneath my hand. I gently tweaked one of her nipples with my lips, then moved my hand down over her abs and onto her mound.</p> <p>As I slid a finger between two strands of her pussy hair, she lifted her butt from the couch. Her crotch pressed into my hand, a soft muffled sound of delight.</p> <p>"You have a beautiful pussy," I said, "And I really want to make love to it," I added, "but you have to get dressed."</p> <p>When she lifted her butt off the couch a little more, the shirt was off her body. I bent down and undid her shorts again, then her panties. Once naked, she stood in front of me, hands on her hips.</p> <p>"Get dressed," she said, "you'll want your turn."</p> <p>Standing, I slid a piece of fabric from her shorts, and then slid my sweatshirt off along with my pants. She had discarded her bra, and her arms were out, resting on the couch.</p> <p>"Put your shirt back on," I said.</p> <p>"You're not ready for this."</p> <p>"I want it," I said. "We've been doing this for years."</p> <p>"We've been doing this for a long time," she said, "and I want this to be special."</p> <p>"Okay," I said. "But what about me?" I continued, "I want to do what I want to, and I want you to be the first one to take my cum tonight. You better wear your robe for it"</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>She slid a piece of cloth over her robe, then put it on.</p> <p>"Can you put the robe on?" I asked.</p> <p>"We'll be out in the garage," she said. "Why don't you meet me up there."</p> <p>Taking her hand, we walked around a corner of the house. We turned the corner and entered a side door. The front door was closed. The house stood wide open, like a museum or a military museum. I stood there for a moment looking at her for an idea, before she opened the door and stepped inside. Walking in, she stopped at the wall, and then opened the door, turning back to me as she did.</p> <p>"Take off your robe and join me," I said.</p> <p>I took her hand and led her back the way we came. I slipped the robe off and tossed it.</p> <p>"Now come," I said.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>I took one step to the bed.</p> <p>"Lie down, and then I want you to do the rest."</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>She laid down nextâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
