"Mmmm... I'm not sure what I'm..." She hesitated a moment, then began.</p> <p>"My sex, honey."</p> <p>I didn't know what to say. She paused and stared at me, her arms in front of her sex with her legs spread. My heart jumped and my eyes flickered down to her face. She hadn't even looked at the look from this morning when she came. I didn't know if I wanted to say this, to ask, or if she would have said that, but she didn't say no.</p> <p>"My sex."</p> <p>Her hands dropped away from her sex. She slowly slid her ass onto the bed, making a pouting circle around the middle. I was shocked to see that she hadn't even removed the laces or anything! "My pussy." I said to her, then quickly corrected. She nodded. "My pussy."</p> <p>I was almost speechless. I'd seen her, heard her, the way it made her sound. I was now lost. I couldn't think, I didn't care, she was just that.</p> <p>But I couldn't move. I had to know if she was enjoying my gaze. I wanted to ask her to do a strip, I wanted... I wanted... It didn't seem right, she could feel it too. I had to ask. I had to find her. Her naked body seemed so sensual, so enticing. She was beautiful. Her skin felt soft, her breasts were so round, the lips of her pussy were soft, her bottom was firm.</p> <p>But then I thought of what it would take if I saw her naked. "My wife for goodness sake!" I tried to say, but couldn't. I didn't know if she could hear that, not knowing if she'd be offended or shocked.</p> <p>She rolled her hips ever so slightly. I thought her skin was glowing. Her pussy seemed swollen. This had to be some kind of reaction, she was aroused, yes... it was beautiful, she was beautiful. I couldn't move.</p> <p>It was all I could do to keep from taking in the entire sight. All I could do was breathe, I'd failed to speak, I didn't dare. She rolled on to her side, her back to me. My face was almost touching. I stared at her naked lower belly. Her bottom was small and round. Not perfect, but round so inviting. I'd expected soft, full skin like hers, but her skin was soft and smooth. The skin on her stomach was soft, but the muscles were soft, hard and strong. "God!" I whispered, "Oh... wow!" My thoughts were drifting away. Her eyes were closed.</p> <p>She slid her legs up and rested them on my shoulders. "I want you to be my first." She whispered that as a lover's whisper.</p> <p>"I can't." I felt her hand on my chest. She was lightly running her fingers across my chest hair and stomach. I closed my eyes a bit, I was nervous, but I still felt a surge of power, of excitement, of need.</p> <p>"Yes." She said. I felt the smile leave her lips for the next moment. "Yes, I can," she murmured.</p> <p>We were silent for a moment, and then my answer came. "Yes." I said softly.</p> <p>"When I was on the stage in the audience and I was sitting in some guy's lap with my leg over his, it didn't feel right, but when I saw the guy with the other leg and the way it was dancing in front of him, it looked really good. We did it a few times."</p> <p>I thought it may have sounded really funny and she seemed happy to continue. I closed my eyes again. "We... I... did it... to make him do something he wouldn't normally..." I started to say this without realizing where I was, but my confusion returned. "We... did it. I did it... I said it" and I tried to say. "Oh. So..." she said, nodding her head and lifting her lips to my ear again, "We did it with him." I shook my head, trying to say she hadn't said that, that I should, I was the one who should say it, I should say what she had told me. But she didn't. It was a moment to remember.</p> <p>"I wanted to show him... me... the way I touched him" she said softly, almost whispering. I felt something in her voice she hadn't expected.</p> <p>"We..." I started again. So I let her. "We... liked... him... so..." I couldn't think clearly.
