I felt her pussy clamp down around my prick hard and quivered against it as she came back to earth. She slid her hand from down my back and took my hands, helping it go to my own breasts. As our hands came to rest, she lifted onto her elbows, staring down at me. Her mouth was wide open and she was breathing heavily, still catching her breath.</p> <p>"Well, I'm not surprised. I heard you come in when you got here."</p> <p>I blushed a bit, unable to answer since my chest was against hers, although it still felt weirdly good. If it was a little strange to feel someone else's body against mine while I came. It felt more like...I didn't know a girl could feel pretty like her.</p> <p>"Good?" I asked. "I don't think I have heard you in here before. I thought you would be in there,"</p> <p>"Not until you had cum yet," she replied. "But I'm sure you would have made it in time. What do you think about how our bodies look?"</p> <p>"You, I think?"</p> <p>She smiled, still staring at me hungrily. I could feel her nipples hardening and I could almost see myself cumming, just from her looking. When I was able to speak I felt the urge to kiss her, but she stepped back, still staring at me.</p> <p>"Not here. If you come out I may not be able to walk."</p> <p>"Don't be silly," I laughed, knowing I wouldn't last long. "You just make my cock harder."</p> <p>"Do we have to?" she asked with a playful smile on her face. She looked down at the cock that had once been inside her before. It was still very hard and looked swollen and red. Her eyes never left it.</p> <p>"Well, since the boys are so horny now, we certainly can't take our eyes off it now," I quipped as I stood. "Maybe next time, we'll leave it in the closet. Maybe even the bedroom."</p> <p>She just smiled at me and kissed my lips, her hand guiding my shaft. "Well, let's see if we can still put something in each other next time, then."</p> <p>She quickly ran from the room, and I was left there, wondering what the night would bring. I heard her giggle and she was gone.</p> <p>As I lay on my pillow I knew she had already left. I didn't have to worry about her. I only had to worry about the situation now. I could wait or wait for my next turn. And, of course, there would be another guy, but he was going to be a little less than my old hulcet friend.
