She had been moaning long before and now he had to make sure her pussy continued to receive his seed.</p> <p>Without warning he had grabbed her hips and forcefully pushed his cock into her. She cried out and then collapsed in a heap. Her head lay on his shoulder and they were both panting for breath.</p> <p>Sue looked up at him. He was still half asleep and she was still on top of him but there was a change in her expression. She had an uncertain look on her face and then slowly raised up and moved off him.</p> <p>Her body was still quivering and she started to come to herself. She leaned forward and kissed him hard, tasting her pussy on him and he was hard again.</p> <p>She climbed off him and he wrapped his arms around her.</p> <p>"Thank you," he said, "I'm sorry I went a bit overboard but we can't do this now. I'm sorry to have lost my appetite and then to have to leave."</p> <p>"Don't be," she said. "I want this to be good for both of us."</p> <p>"But..." he started</p> <p>she kissed him again and pushed away.</p> <p>"Come find me on Christmas Eve. Make love to me again. I'm your lover. I love you, always."</p> <p>With that, she got dressed and they kissed and then lay side by side on the sofa. He reached down and started to play with her breasts, squeezing them gently.</p> <p>"Sue, it's Christmas Eve for me, now you're mine."</p> <p>She squeezed her eyes shut again, and he began to play with her nipples.</p> <p>"Oh, you know I'm going to come soon," he groaned.</p> <p>He pulled away and got on the floor in front of her. He gently started to finger her clitoris, then started to lick her again. She reached out and wrapped her hand around his rock hard cock. He slid his fingers back and forth, slowly, while he looked at her.</p> <p>"What are you thinking?" she asked.</p> <p>"I'm going to come. Will you make me come?" he asked, almost sounding scared.</p> <p>"I can't. I'm not ready as yet. Maybe today I should call a meeting," she sighed. She got up, went over to the sofa and sat down beside him, then leaned forward to kiss him.</p> <p>"I've got everything ready and we can talk about what we can do next," she said.</p> <p>She got on her knees and lifted his cock back to erection. She looked up at him and licked her lips.</p> <p>"I would like a little more time to think."</p> <p>She got on her hands and knees, took his cock in her hand and looked back at him.</p> <p>"I don't want to wait. I want you. I want to feel you inside me again. I need the real thing now."</p> <p>She looked back at him in the mirror.</p> <p>"Maybe we could just make love and come together. It would be wrong. It would be cheating."</p> <p>"Oh, I don't want to be unfaithful!" he said with a laugh.</p> <p>She gave it all back to him and then crawled back to him.</p> <p>"Sue, maybe we should get this started," he said suddenly. He started to caress her hair.</p> <p>"If we do it, we'll do it again," she said with a knowing smile. Then she knelt in front of him and took him into her mouth again.</p> <p>She got on her hands and knees again and he looked at her ass. She was wiggling it in his direction, making sure he could see it.</p> <p>"You know, you're pretty lovely ass that I could really get lost in, so I like a nice, slow session in the morning," he said.</p> <p>He put one finger on her anus. It had no real effect and she turned her cheek to him.</p> <p>"Just imagine my fingers in that tight little asshole," he said. Then one more time.</p> <p>After another minute he turned her onto her back and moved himself to her. She spread her legs and he entered her, slowly, almost taking her by surprise. She put her arms under her legs and pulled them back to her chest. They rocked and he reached around and held her tits with his hands. She turned them over and he held and played with her nipples.</p> <p>"Take me!"</p> <p>"Take me where?"</p> <p>"Use me!"</p> <p>"Okay, but first we have to get a condom for both."</p> <p>Before she could do anything, he got on his knees and pulled his cock outâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
