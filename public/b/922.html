That big ol' cock of yours is really hard. Is that true? I mean you like being my toy or anything? Well, don't worry; I'm not taking no for an answer. I'm not taking you away from the world or anything. My friends are nice and they're really nice, but we just use the money and get the best of us, and our friends don't get away... but that's really not what you are here for.</p> <p>"The last thing you need is someone who isn't here to love you, and be herded down the path of debauchery. That's what's wrong with you, isn't it?</p> <p>Molly, your nipples are so much different than others. I know you like it, because you can tell. My nipples get hard when I sit and when I'm being with you I get hard too. I love the thought that you love me and I love you. That's why I want to see you and have people take you places you don't believe you're ever going to go. And you can't get that right when you start taking me and everything else but where it really counts.</p> <p>"Yes, I guess it does. We don't have to think of what our life is; we have all the answers to that issue, and no one is going to force us to do anything it isn't for us to just walk away. That doesn't mean we don't deserve your love, Molly... or my pleasure. But I'm not sure we still deserve to be with you.</p> <p>"I know I'm still a little bit sore for whatever you did with the hairbrush, but it's not that serious. You hurt me, and it's no less serious, because you hurt someone... I didn't know. Anyway, I have you and your toys and all you have to do is give them a chance and try to give them happiness. No judgments.</p> <p>"I still need you to think about things from the past. I can't think of any more. I can't really think of the last time that I could tell you I was hurt... it was nothing! And to think you are not the same person we just met now. I wish you'd understand, and that's the only thing you can do for me.</p> <p>"There are some things I can't explain... but if you really love me, will you let me make them up to you. Is that even good, Molly?"</p> <p>"Yes, of course it is."</p> <p>She's always been such a sweet baby, being so sweet to me. "Okay, then, I'm yours until next week." With that she gives one last squeeze to my cock and slides out of the door. "Don't let me down tonight, sweetheart, I'm a woman of few tricks," I tell her before I leave her apartment and head to my apartment. I'm pretty proud of that.</p> <p>In my apartment, I strip off my clothes, and hang them on the hook. They're all so beautiful that I can't help staring at them, feeling them grow in my hands just a bit as I do so. I lay out my clothes on the bed, and then slip into one of the outfits I wore last night. It's casual, and I leave the lights off. I then lay out some clothes for later on, just in case, just in case, and just for the sake of a little fun on the way, and a little extra money.</p> <p>I also pick out a pair of panties, a bra, and some other things I'm sure the girls at the restaurant and other places in town would recognize if they saw me in them. I have a nice little red vibrator that I bought in a boutique back in October, when I decided to buy it at a small discount store. I put a note of how the vibrating one is, in case I need to, and the batteries go in. I take them out of the bathroom and give them a quick cleaning. That way at least two weeks out of the year I can use them now; just in case I need them all for a month.</p> <p>Then just like last night, I dress up for the night. I had a few more outfits planned tonight, too; just in case they can't get anything out of me, so I put on a new pair of panties and a bra and start walking into town. We walk to the cafe, where I place the bill and put the bill in. Then I sit down and read the newspaper, just as it says on my lease. I watch the clock to make sure it's after four o'clock and still have plenty of time left. And do so anyway, watching for traffic. And I have to have some more energy tomorrow, knowing exactly what I'm going to do. I also have to go get something to eat, sinceâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
