Or should I ask you to keep someone as harmless as me out of your life."</p> <p>"Maybe," he answered. "If you were with her."</p> <p>"I could come home with you for the summer with her."</p> <p>"That doesn't make it right for me to be with another guy?"</p> <p>"No. I think you'd be kind to just watch her without the need for a relationship. That was one of the reasons I suggested it to you."</p> <p>"It was... a great idea."</p> <p>"But why would you want to be with a guy? It was just something your mom taught me. I don't know. I mean, it never crossed my mind. Not like the things we just did. I love you and that's all there is. I love you and it doesn't matter to anyone else. You were there, you were with her. You've changed since we started dating. We're both happy."</p> <p>"But it's not like we're a couple," he reminded her. "I've been with my parents and they're not happy either."</p> <p>"You have to stay with your mother," she said seriously. "She's got a point."</p> <p>"What would your friends be like?"</p> <p>"If I stay with her, I won't want to have to be alone. As an old man who likes sex and the whole idea of having sex comes to mind." I reached for him and he leaned back into the chair. "Don't be afraid to tell me. Just tell me."</p> <p>"Mom won't understand why I don't want to stay here with you. Maybe she doesn't like the idea of me having sex with another girl. Or maybe she doesn't really want me with you all at once."</p> <p>"Just because you like sex doesn't mean you'll go on."</p> <p>I gave him my best smile before saying, "Okay, I'll keep in mind what I said. But I have to go on for you to visit her in the summer."</p> <p>"I'm glad," he said with a touch of sarcasm. "When will you see her?"</p> <p>"I haven't really decided."</p> <p>"I'll call her when she's not out at night, okay?"</p> <p>"Okay." He smiled and walked out the door.</p> <p>I called her and told her when I was on my way home. I told her that I wouldn't be home. I told her that I was off to visit a friend. That seemed to lighten her mood a little.</p> <p>I checked the time. My first stop was to look at the new swim wear store. It was a two-storey, three-story building that was filled with tall, open-air windows selling high end suits. The building also had a second, single story open-air balcony. As I approached, I saw that there were eight of the suits in there. Most of the suits had one button open. I went to the second shop and picked one up, but I didn't see it.</p> <p>After the suit I stopped in the same area that I had been. It was on display in the open air on the second store window. The windows had a little shelf next to the shelf. I looked into a display of high heels and realized that I'd been caught by my eyes. I got a shock at the clerk in the next store.</p> <p>"Excuse me," I said, "but you've been staring."</p> <p>"Oh, no," she whispered. "The sales counter was behind the dressing room door. I didn't want to leave."</p> <p>"No problem."</p> <p>"Well, it's not fair that you have an excuse to stare like that," she said, looking back at the top of the mirrored wardrobe.</p> <p>"Yes. No. It's not."</p> <p>"Just one time. You were staring at me. You can look away."</p> <p>"Well, sorry," I said, "I can't help it."</p> <p>"No. Go right ahead. Or you can stop there. I don't like it when people stare at your boobs."</p> <p>"I don't know if I should say that," I said. I was a little uncomfortable, but I could understand there was a part of me that wanted more attention. "Maybe not just looking."</p> <p>"No, I'm not wearing them. Do you have to be so perceptive about me looking at you like that?"</p> <p>"I'll just make the most of it," I said and walked away.</p> <p>The lingerie store had a few people that I didn't know. Not many people were at all. I went in. They were both at the register.
