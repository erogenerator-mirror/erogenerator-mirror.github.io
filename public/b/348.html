He groaned as he pushed into her hard and deeply, burying his entire cock inside. Her insides began to tremble as she felt herself begin to come again, her pussy clenching around his hard cock, squeezing him tight, milking him as she bucked in orgasm.</p> <p>He held still, pushing her down as she squirmed on top of him as wave after wave of pleasure crashed over her as she writhed in his arms, quivering and panting as she rode him toward her own orgasm. He lifted himself up and then began to kiss her deeply, tasting himself on her breath and lips. Her body flushed as she continued to tremble in his arms, enjoying so much the sensations as her insides became more sensitive. She wrapped her arms around his neck, reveling in his kisses and caresses as he pushed and held her until she was finished, then she kissed him again.</p> <p>He raised himself upright with them still locked together, pulling his dick from its wet prison. He laid her down on the bed, her naked body completely hairless with no traces of hair in her bush. He slid into bed with her, his arms and legs holding her in a tight embrace as he lay on his side facing her, his face nuzzling her, his lips touching hers. He could tell by the passion in her that she was in a trance, and she didn't seem to have the strength or will to do anything else. She began to whisper his name as she melted into his arms, her arms wrapped around him as her hands caressed his back, her soft lips gently kissing his chin, his neck, and finally moving down to his chest where she nibbled and kissed his nipples, then sucked on them as he gently moved downward to kiss the inside of her thighs, her inner thighs, and her wet pussy through the thin nylon panty crotch of her panties.</p> <p>She pulled herself closer to his lips as he kissed their joining more fervently, pushing her hips up as she began to kiss and lick his hard nipple. She felt him start to rock his hips against her, moving in and out as he slid his hand over her crotch and then slid his hand down her belly and between her thighs. She sighed when he rubbed against her clit and slid his middle finger into her wet pussy, slowly stroking it as he lowered his face to her, taking her nipple into his mouth, circling his tongue around it as he began to thrust his finger into her as she spread her legs wider and spread her lips further.</p> <p>She moaned her frustration as she was denied the taste of her own pussy as he slowly fingered her. Her breath caught as he began to lick along her lips, causing her to open her eyes and look at him as she saw him slide his tongue into her, then slowly withdraw it, sliding it up along her lips in a circle as he repeated this several times as his fingers pumped in and out of her. He pressed his lips against hers again, as his finger began to stroke in and out of her as he licked her neck from her ear to her lips.</p> <p>"Ahhh!" she moaned, "ohhhh." She closed her eyes and she felt the pressure rising in her pussy as she tried to push her hips towards his tongue as he brought her closer to her orgasm. He began to slide his finger in and out of her, his tongue circling her hard clit, his fingers pumping in and out of her, his finger sliding back and forth between her lips, sliding it over and around her sensitive clit as she felt herself approaching another orgasm.</p> <p>"Yes! Oh yes!" She cried as she felt the pleasure rising in her body, "I'm going to come." She gasped, "ohhhhh!"</p> <p>He stopped his finger fucking as she began to spasm, her pussy tightening on his finger, feeling the orgasm wash over her as he pushed it farther into her, still licking her. She pulled herself up from his mouth as he kissed her hard on top of her head as she began to relax a little, her stomach muscles still quivering with the aftershocks. As she lay on the wetness of the bed, he ran his hands up her legs, cupping her ass as he moved in to kiss her again. She sucked on his tongue as well as he did hers and he slowly slid his hands down her, feeling the tightness of her pussy as he cupped her.</p> <p>"Oh, you look so beautiful," he said as he ran his hands up her legs again, feeling the silkiness against his fingers, his own breath coming in short gasps as he touched her between her legs, pushing in past the silky lining. She pressed her thighs tightly together, her nipples pressing into his chest as he pushed a finger into her, causing her to squirm under his touch.</p> <p>"You're such a good boy," she saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
