She kissed me back. A long lingering kiss, a long lingering kiss, and I felt her lips quivering against mine. I kissed her back again. This time it was soft and languid and with just the right intensity that brought me back to reality. I broke the kiss.</p> <p>"Is this the first time our lips met"? I smiled to myself. "I'm not even the first person to kiss you," I thought. "We had an agreement the first time."</p> <p>"Oh my god, John, I can't believe I did that, a few years back, and I kissed you so hard," she giggled. "A few months ago, it was just...a quickie, one date, but a quick one." Again, she broke the kiss, leaned back, and spoke quietly, "Did you like it?"</p> <p>"Hell yes! That was the absolute best kiss I have ever had, but it wasn't all that much fun," I responded honestly. "So I don't know if I can call this one the same as I kissed you."</p> <p>"That was just as good as a date!" she said. "I'd love to continue kissing you but I'm not ready to do that yet."</p> <p>"Well, you won't be the only one who's waiting a year for this," I said softly, "Let's see if we can do this the way we did with the first time."</p> <p>Slowly, she started to stand and turned to face me. I rose to my feet and walked her over to the bed. As I looked at her, I couldn't believe that I was going to do it. I have never made love to a woman before. The first few moments were exciting, as I held her close and began kissing her more aggressively. Her kisses were sensual and very passionate, so I did not rush the way we had done. As I pulled away, I could tell that she was enjoying it.</p> <p>"You have a beautiful wife," I said to her as I began to kiss the inside of her knee.</p> <p>"Oh yes, he did," she replied. "He was such a gentleman, the way he kissed you."</p> <p>"You know you can do that to me," I replied, "I want you with me. "</p> <p>"I know," she responded, "you are a perfect gentleman."</p> <p>"Are you sure, she asks. "We can always make love anytime you want," I explained to her with a smile.</p> <p>She laughed, "Well, I think we can do this. I don't have to wait so long for it to be good."</p> <p>"Well, you better be ready to do it. When you let loose, you can kiss me as hard as you like, you can kiss my neck as hard as you like, and you can kiss my nipples at the same time," I offered.</p> <p>She leaned forward and gave me a long and sexy kiss, then pulled back. We made our way to the bed and made love, very hard and deeply, with all kinds of intensity. We fucked like fiend animals for the next five years and it was the best lovemaking I have ever had. Our sex was different than the old days when we had wild and passionate sex. It was wilder. It was more exciting to me. With all the things we did after the first year, it was better than I had ever thought it could be for me. In return, as I would have said, we were just perfect for each other.</p> <p>Two years ago, I had an idea. "J.J., if you ever want a second chance, if you ever feel the time comes for a second chance relationship, then please consider it." I told her. I wanted to keep our relationship just between us. Our first anniversary was two days ago and a week after our last encounter. "I'd love it, if you ever feel it's time, I'll always love you," I'd said to her.</p> <p>The next day, I had a couple of things to do before work. "J.J., before work, if you ever want a second chance, just let me know," I told her.</p> <p>"John, don't do anything you're going to regret," she pleaded with me. "I think we can do everything we've ever done together." I had never thought I could be as sincere about this as I was.</p> <p>So on the very first day of our anniversary we decided to make love to each other, while we were married.</p> <p>I came home early from work and went to the garage to check on things a bit.
