She had been thinking about this for the last few days, and it hadn't even been this night. "I can't believe she has a boyfriend. A boyfriend only interested in her breasts," she thought, "and that makes me all twisted up."</p> <p>Amy knelt down in front of him and grabbed his cock. She was glad her shorts were pulled down to the crotch, because all she could imagine was that she was being jerked by him, and her hand could not touch his cock but couldn't really be entirely sure, either. To go with it, she had to go commando. He had a long-stemmed little penis and it was already a raging hard-on. She grabbed it with one hand and held it up in the air.</p> <p>Kerry looked down at her. The lips of her pussy were already slightly parted, showing the wetness in the center of her. He couldn't wait to slip it inside of her. He looked down at her and smiled. He slid his hand over her stomach and found her mound, moving his finger over the top, finding her wetness and pushing his finger into her. Amy's hips rose, lifting off the floor, and he watched her face as she closed her eyes and tilted forward, her lips parting as his finger slid into her pussy.</p> <p>Amy's eyes were closed and she was breathing heavily. She lifted her head off the desk, moaning as Kerry continued to pump his finger in and out of her pussy. She leaned back into him, her breasts thrust upward and his cock against her belly. Her lips parted as the passion within her grew.</p> <p>"I'm so wet!" she exclaimed, letting go of his penis and grabbing the desk with both hands. "Just like you, I hope you can cum in my mouth."</p> <p>"Yes, and I intend to," he said as he bent forward and began to lick her pussy. Amy sighed as he made contact with her wet lips. She pushed her pussy against his face. "Oh God, you don't know how good this feels!"</p> <p>"Well, it doesn't hurt that much," he said, his tongue plunging over and around her clit. His fingers were also beginning to glide into her pussy, making her body jump in response, and her pussy lips began to open and close. "I can actually taste the juices on your lips," he said.</p> <p>He continued to suck her clit, moving his finger in and out in time with his tongue. She was starting to come. He knew it and it was a little faster than she would like, and when she did, it was stronger. Amy's body was now completely out of control. At the height of orgasm, she couldn't even concentrate on making herself come. She was on the verge of her own orgasm as her hands came up, gripping the top of her desk, pushing out as she bucked her hips up against his fingers. She felt her stomach convulse and her back arch as she let out a long, low moan before her knees started to buckle.</p> <p>"Oh God! Don't stop," her voice was a whiny, "Fuck me. Now. Please," she begged, "make me come again."</p> <p>Her pussy seemed to get even more sensitive since he kept up kissing her pussy and licking her clit. She could feel the tingles starting just inside her thighs, but it wasn't enough to keep her going. Her orgasm was building faster and stronger. She was on the edge. Then, his tongue stopped and he felt her body relax, her legs falling back to the floor. She just lay there, eyes closed and splayed open.</p> <p>Her pussy contracted around his tongue as wave after wave of after-the-fist-climax washed over her. Kerry gently pulled his fingers out of her and she started rolling her head left and right, feeling his tongue inside her.</p> <p>"Kerry, I'm sorry," she said, smiling at him and smiling, "but I didn't mean to cum. I wanted to feel you in me. I was just afraid that you would like my roommate, especially this guy that's so nice to me."</p> <p>Kerry laughed, "So are we going to see them together tonight?"</p> <p>"Maybe!" she said. She turned to him, reaching out to caress his face with her hand. She was amazed that his lips and tongue knew the way to make her feel so good. "Oh yes," she said, "you are a wonderful lover."</p> <p>"You have no idea how much!" he said, leaning forward, kissing her gently. "Thank youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
