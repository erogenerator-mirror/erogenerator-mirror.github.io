We hurried to the bedroom, and I locked the door behind us. He had the same effect on me as my brother, and I loved him for it. I grabbed his boxers and t-shirt off his sweat soaked body as we quickly fell naked on the bed, but we were still not done with each other. Lying back on our backs, we held each other, caressing each other’s body and kissing as we did so in the dim light of the night. He pulled me on top of him, our lips never breaking our intense kiss. We made out for several minutes, then I slid down his body to begin kissing his neck and chest before my mouth found his nipple. I sucked it gently, feeling it stiffen in my mouth, then began to flick my tongue over it. I rolled it around, then wrapped my lips around it with my tongue, then began licking him just lightly enough to tease his body slightly. He moaned, then pulled me down next to him once more. We kissed each other passionately, feeling our bodies press together and rub against each other as one. He began kissing my chest and down towards my nipples. My body shivered when he reached my chest and kissed my breasts, his hands rubbing and playing with my body as his lips covered my nipple in soft warm wet kisses. He sucked it between his lips, gently biting it as he did so. I squeezed his thigh tight, loving the effect his fingers were having on my thigh. His hand then moved up along my body, his lips following the trail of his hand as it traveled, past my belly button to my belly button. My breath caught in my throat when my hand slowly slid under my thong and he began to touch me. My back arched, feeling his fingers on my wet pussy lips, his lips touching them as he slowly inserted two fingers up inside me. As he began sliding his fingers in and out of me, I could feel the wetness of my opening on his fingers as they slid in and out so effortlessly now. I began to rock my body against his, my body completely consumed by the feeling of pleasure and desire.</p> <p>I felt my pussy begin to convulse as the feeling reached its conclusion with an explosion from my body and my body. Waves of pleasure shook my body while my mouth hungrily continued to suck on my now throbbing nipple. I felt his fingers inside my pussy. The feeling pushed me over the edge of orgasm, as he continued to gently slide his fingers in and out of me. I held him against me for a moment longer, trying to gather my breath, then slid his body down mine, my lips trailing down his body until I could move back up, our mouths meeting again and again for another passionate kiss. He held me up, my head on the pillow, as we lay there, our bodies completely covered with sweat from the hard fucking we had just had. It felt so surreal, my body completely on fire, with pleasure pulsing through all parts of me. I closed my eyes and we lay like that for a while, before I rolled onto my side, and began kissing my way down his body. I slowly made my way until my face was level with his hard cock, already twitching within his pants. I began kissing all around it, loving it with each hot breath that my tongue made contact with his shaft. He raised his hips a little, but I stopped, looking up at his face. He smiled, knowing where the tease was going and not wanting me to stop. I leaned forward and kissed the head of his cock as my hand slowly slid up and down it. I licked it, first from the tip to the tip before wrapping my lips around his cockhead. I slid it in and out of my mouth slowly, my tongue caressing his shaft as if it were my last meal.</p> <p>I continued giving my brother one of the best blowjobs of his life in his position. I felt him start to get harder underneath me as I began sucking slowly up and down his shaft. I could feel his legs begin move of their own volition, and I felt his hands on my head as he pulled me closer to him. I stopped sucking off his cock, and began to kiss down his body. He laid back, opening his legs as far apart as possible as I took in his cock. He moaned as my lips finally touched his dick. I pulled his dick to its full length, taking it all the way down, leaving it hanging against his belly. Slowly I began bobbing my head on his dick, my tongue never leaving his shaft, my mouth sliding up his dick, my lips barely touching the bottom as they slid up and down his shaft. My body began to shiver at the feeling of the wetness on my body as my body became wetter. My legs tightened—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
