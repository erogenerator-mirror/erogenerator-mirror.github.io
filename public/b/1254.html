I enquired, trying not to flash the cat's eye as I spoke.</p> <p>"Not bad...not bad at all," responded the blushing blonde, her face showing signs of embarrassment, "I'm five and a half inches around. But just as well, I just had to walk a long way just to find you."</p> <p>I was still feeling a bit of an awkward sensation for having a young bloke. His girlfriend had just given me my first blow-job, and I was still being polite as always.</p> <p>We were chatting quite naturally afterwards and after dinner I suggested that we go for a stroll on the beach for about ten minutes to catch a few more sun, then head back to our place. I'd be happy to just watch for a while there and we had an idea on where the next town to the beach was, if he was as interested in the local girls as I was.</p> <p>"Of course," I said, "We'll just have to get back to him and see how far away we come before we have to leave."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm not sure if I can stand that. I think I'm starting to have second thoughts."</p> <p>"Don't be silly, come on," I teased, "we're just going, you're far enough away to not get any ideas in there."</p> <p>He turned to walk along the beach with me, his arm around me and pulling me with him. After a few minutes, he said "I see your feeling a little more relaxed, I'd love to return later, but the walk to the beach is rather longer. Would you like me to take you home then?"</p> <p>"Oh, no, I shouldn't have. I'm not going anywhere." I smiled up at him, reaching down to kiss his cheek and give his hand a little squeeze as we walked along the water. He took her hand and started walking, his arm around her, holding her a bit too tightly.</p> <p>Ten minutes or so had passed before we made it to the car park and he opened the boot and pulled out my keys.</p> <p>"Oh thank God," I said, "I feel a lot better now. You are so smooth."</p> <p>"Well, you're a bit younger than my last girlfriend, that's OK," I joked, "and I know how to take care of myself."</p> <p>I pulled him in to hug him again, as I kissed his neck and his lips. He put his right hand on mine and then began stroking my thumb, which was still very much still. I took his keys and we started walking together towards the car. "There's a spare key in the ignition," I said, "I'll unlock it after we're in and turn it on."</p> <p>He gave a sheepish grin and walked to open the door for me, putting the keys back in the ignition. We climbed in and he gave the wheel a few quick turns, before we drove off.</p> <p>"Just in case somebody else is in the car," I said, "I'd love if you stayed in here longer."</p> <p>"OK," said his hand stroking my arm and then leaning in to kiss me again through the kiss, "I'll see you tomorrow then."</p> <p>I had just reached over to unlock the seatbelt when I felt him taking his cock out and stroking it through his shorts as we drove off. I took the opportunity of the spare key and got out the car to find his number pad on the seat, and was about to start it when I couldn't help but hear that familiar 'Mmm' and a light click of the lock. I took a little longer but eventually it reached the top of the car. I turned the key and the door opened for him while I took a deep breath and held the car door shut while he got into the car. I quickly got out as well and he drove off with me taking his place, although I noticed his eyes were looking from car to car again before he smiled and started the car. I followed him and we were soon going back to our place.</p> <p>"So where to now?" I said, "I'm already hungry for food, so what do you've got on your mind?"</p> <p>"Oh don't worry, I have a couple of days in store then I think I'll have some dinner for us," he said grinning as he started in for the door.</p> <p>"And you can put the kettle on," I replied, pulling the key from the ignition and putting it on the side of the door. "Would you be pleased if I called the chef first? He'll be away in an hour or so."</p> <p>"I'm sure he'll have a big plate and a big appetite," he smiled, taking another sip from his drink, "Do you mind if I use your bathroom first?"
