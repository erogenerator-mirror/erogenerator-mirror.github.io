He kissed her neck. "And I love you. I want you so badly." With that he picked up his camera and began shooting. He clicked away while she rubbed herself against him, her pussy slick with her arousal. Then suddenly he removed his fingers and dropped to his knees to take off her shoes. "Nnnnhh," she moaned in frustration, "please..." He looked up at her as she began unbuttoning his shirt. "No..." She didn't finish. "I'm not wearing anything underneath...please?" She leaned forward and let him take it off. She was already out of her knickers and his cock was fully erect.</p> <p>"Ah..." She gave him a quizzical look as she pulled him to his feet and pressed herself against him. Slowly, gently they kissed in rhythm to the music. Neither could remember the last time they'd been like this. She felt like she should say something, but she'd had so much to drink already, and she didn't want to ruin what they'd already started in the end. At least, not with this man. He made her feel like she had to feel what he was doing, and it wasn't love, not even if it turned out to be more.</p> <p>Before he knew it his shirt and shirt were gone, and she wasn't wearing anything. He looked down from her lustrous brown curls at the beautiful curves of her body and took the initiative to pull on her jeans. Without asking, as far as she knew, he'd put them on her so fast that she thought she was going to burn in flames! She'd been drunk before, and this time she couldn't remember how she'd managed it.</p> <p>"Wait," she said, and he didn't have to be asked again. He slid his hands down her sides and under the straps on her jeans, pulling her towards him and dropping her to her hands and knees. Without another word, he lifted her into the air and carried her across to the desk like a weight bench. He put her on it on her back, and she laid back with her eyes closed and her long fingers fisted up and down the length of him. He kneeled down and licked her to the edge of her panties, then began rubbing the bulge of his cock through her tight jeans. He pushed the waistband open, and her tight white panties slid down to her ankles. She was hot and needy, and he could feel himself begin to swell.</p> <p>He pulled her legs up and hooked them around his hips, then positioned himself at her entrance. She was sopping wet, and his large head of him slipped into her. He pushed in as far as it would go, and felt her pussy contract around his shaft in what seemed to be a vice-like grasp. He knew she had to be in her own world now, and it was clear which feeling she was having as it felt so good: the feeling of being penetrated and of being in contact with her own body; the tingles of feeling like butterflies and running through her as she came.</p> <p>She gripped him with her hips and he began to thrust himself into her. With each stroke he knew more and louder noises, and the sound of her breathing became louder. Her hands clutched at his hair as she moaned her pleasure. "More..." she pleaded. Not yet, she promised herself, not yet. He was already in her, so to make that more intimate they had another first time, and it was going to end soon. He was not going to hold back.</p> <p>He felt the tightness of her pussy milking his cock. He felt her cumming again, and it was all he could do to stifle himself and push himself in deeper. Finally she felt herself lose control and felt him pump out his cum, grunting as his hot seed bathed her insides in thick jets that had already made her cum again.</p> <p>He rolled off her onto his back next to her. "That was..." he started, but couldn't finish before she spoke.</p> <p>"Fucking amazing." She smiled before taking one final deep breath and stretching, "thanks for that. But this could really use a workout."</p> <p>"Yeah, I sure as hell need one." He pulled her around and onto his lap, and they kissed.</p> <p>After the session, he was all smiles. It was going to be fun. She loved him to pieces but didn't want to start now that he looked a little more like the guy she'd been searching for. Then she noticed that the bulge in his pants had disappeared, and he was completely quiet.</p> <p>"What's with the bulge?" she asked, a note of worry in her voice. He was not one to let up easily.</p> <p>"I have a feeling that next to everything you're wearing I just might give a fuck for a minute there, but..." He grabbed her byâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
