He continued to talk, mostly by himself, making no attempt at his usual self-assurance. He seemed to find himself at the top of his game, making him feel as if he never had the courage to even attempt the game. She thought at first that he was just trying to make conversation with her, but then she saw a note on the table from her friend, asking her if she would join her for dinner. She smiled and told her it was okay, she was going to tell her she wasn't hungry and she was free to go home. This wasn't really any different from the games she'd played. She thought she'd have to think long and hard about it later.</p> <p>She had been drinking quite a bit and felt a little tipsy as she got up to leave, walking around the room so she was not aware of everything. The note they'd exchanged was short and to the point, telling her she was welcome to join her if she wanted to. She turned to put the note down on the table but he stopped her. He said, without even looking at her, that he would not hurt her.</p> <p>"Don't touch her. I will take good care of her."</p> <p>She stared at him in disbelief, stunned at the whole "boy" thing.</p> <p>"Do you trust me?" the note asked. She was still not sure she answered and he seemed to go through a number of different things before finally saying "yes of course" and slipping her the note. She read it a dozen times before it was too late, the taste was strong in her mouth.</p> <p>The next night, she was in bed trying to do homework, when the phone went off. "John?"</p> <p>She said goodbye, but she didn't return the call. Her sister wanted the house to be locked up in her guest bedroom, so she had not invited a friend to the house as that was where the party was. So, her friend was still at work, and so, not answering the phone she decided she'd invite her to dinner. After the initial surprise, she felt good about meeting him. He had made a big impression on her, and he seemed to be a very handsome guy. She had also been drinking, so she decided now was as good a time as ever to take a shower.</p> <p>She made the most of her shower quickly, running it over her full body. In it she tried to do her hair very short, but it made her look very pretty to the eye. After her hair was wet, she put on a very pretty red silk robe which tied in back. She tied the sash at the small of her back and slid it down over her hips, revealing the curves of her gorgeous ass. She stepped into her underwear and made her way to the bathroom to wait. As she waited she could feel the tingle in her pussy, and she could feel a tingling in her nipples. When the door clicked shut, she thought she would go wild. She went to get the razor and shaving cream.</p> <p>John was standing by the tub, his legs out, water trickling down his face. He reached down, picked up her towel from the shower wall and started to wipe her.</p> <p>"Turn around," he ordered. "I want to shave your asshole."</p> <p>She stood still for a moment as he spread her legs and shaved her. He held a razor in his hands. "Put it on the back of the towel," he said. She started to object, but he gently removed the towel and the razor. "Let me take care of everything," he whispered. "You're my slut."</p> <p>"You can use your hand," he said, and she nodded, agreeing. "I can't believe you did that," she said. "It felt really good."</p> <p>"That's nice of you to say that. You were supposed to let me do it," he said. She nodded again and began to shave him. It seemed a little strange, but that was exactly what she wanted. He watched her as she shaved her leg, getting a tingle in her nipples, which she tried to keep from touching against the robe.</p> <p>"I think I can use a little help," he whispered. He reached quickly and picked up a large shaving tube from the counter, and used it to shave her right arm. It felt good, but it was getting hard to think, and she had to admit that she wasn't very good at that.</p> <p>"Take your night dress off," he said. She did as she was told. "Turn around," he ordered. She got the razor and started to shave her legs. "Turn around and put my legs in the mirror," he said again. She turned and got a good look at her ass. She had taken her panties off so the towel was in its placeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
