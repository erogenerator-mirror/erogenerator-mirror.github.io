What, what are you talking about?" He stared at me again. "She looked like she was trying to hide something at the end of lunch. I thought she had a headache."</p> <p>"Come on, you can tell me if you want. Besides, I think we have something on our minds about what happened in the bathroom."</p> <p>"You didn't do anything!"</p> <p>"Well, I didn't but I'll take your word for it. You have to admit, I like her. I mean I think you do have something on your mind but I don't think we should make the most of it..."</p> <p>I knew right then that we could do whatever we wanted with each other without any consequences, so I took his hands in mine and started leading him towards the bathroom. Once in the bathroom I turned on the shower and we both started to undressed. I was so tempted to put my clothes back on and have some fun with him, but I didn't know what to do. So I started to strip off my shirt and skirt and took them off as well. I took them right off the other side of the pool.</p> <p>He was watching me but just as we turned and turned the shower head on, he stopped us again and said, "What's wrong? You guys seem kind of crazy..."</p> <p>"Oh, we're actually just having fun. We just got lost in the water," I said as I dropped my clothes on the ground and started to shower. "But before you can get in here with me, I'm going to join you both in the shower."</p> <p>I turned around and put my hands on my breasts for emphasis. "See how much you make me want to do this, you guys!"</p> <p>He said nothing.</p> <p>I just took his hand and placed it between my legs. He was touching me with no further discussion.</p> <p>I was already wet from the sight of him. We both started to wash each others hands. I kissed each one and asked, "What's this all about?"</p> <p>He just looked at me and said; "Well, if it makes you uncomfortable..."</p> <p>I looked to him as I took my hands so I could wash his chest. As my hand came closer to his mouth, he grabbed it from my. It was so soft and so inviting to him. "Go on," I encouraged him. "It's time for more."</p> <p>He let go of my hand and I put mine down to see what he was going to do first. I found him by the towel he had wrapped around him and started to wash his hair. His eyes were closed and when his head tilted up, I saw a smile cross his face. It was not an expression of shyness or anger. It was a smile of contentment.</p> <p>My towel wasn't even covering my entire pubic area so I used it to soap his crotch and let my hand slip between the top of my legs into my pussy to wash out as well. When he said he's just in the shower, that's not the case. He has a small cock and I know how much you would love to have some fun with it. But, for a guy of his stature, his dick is quite modest and is only about 7-8 inches and very big around. I love teasing his monster. As I was massaging his dick, I realized I did it not for him. I don't think he really did much for me. I liked him to have some self control. I didn't really know what to do but once in the shower, I enjoyed myself a lot more.</p> <p>When the shower stop, I went out and stood for while on display for the men in the hot showers. I didn't have time to wash my hair as I could hear them getting out of the showers. Before I walked back out to their table I went into his room. I closed the door and just turned on the lights to check that everyone else was gone.</p> <p>It was obvious my outfit was as slutty as I felt. I had on my long, black nightress and my panties. I slipped on my thigh high black stockings and put my high heels on my foot. I checked myself in the mirror and realized that there were no lights on in my room but I was sure it was just me.</p> <p>"Well boys, I guess she doesn't want me to show her panties when she came back out of the shower." I was happy for him as his eyes got a bit worried.</p> <p>"Hey, we never told you," I said as I took a step towards him. "And I told you, we were just going to have a quickie."</p> <p>He turned, took my hand and said, "Go on, get undressed, please!"</p> <p>I didn't have to ask if I could or even ask. He stripped off his clothes and sat downâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
