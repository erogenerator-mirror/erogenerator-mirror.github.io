"Are your nipples erect?" I asked.</p> <p>She nodded quickly, as if she didn't want to talk, "Yes." She nodded again, her face turning away from me. I looked at her in a way I didn't want her to, but somehow I wanted to see what my dick was like so I reached down with my hands. Her eyes shot opened, and she turned away from me again. I pulled her against me quickly, holding her tight against my chest and kissing her lightly. She leaned back, and as I stared into her eyes, I felt a deep connection between us, a connection that we had never before discovered in public. "I want you," I whispered, and she nodded again.</p> <p>"I need to be inside you," I said, feeling my dick throbbing once again as I whispered the one part of my plan that had never happened before, "I don't ever want to stop." I ran my hands from her hips along her sides and up her sides to her breasts. I took one of her nipples in my thumb, and began circling it with the wet tip. The contact with her nipple made her eyes go wide. I could see her hands pulling at the sheets, and I took this opportunity to lift her chin to kiss her lightly. She eagerly moved her hands up to my neck. I could feel the taut muscles there, a softness like silk against me. In that instance, it was as if time stood still. As she kissed me, I pushed my hands down her body, across the short black skirt, and down over her ass. I pulled the cloth skirt up over her hips and up over her back. As soon as she felt the cool air on her ass, she lifted her arms, and I reached to remove the shirt. She didn't bother with the bra, and I could smell her arousal, her aroused body under it.</p> <p>"I like your cock, Jack," she said, as she reached up and began stroking me lightly, "I'm very horny today." She paused as I was still working on her breasts, "I thought maybe I could get off," she said as she continued to tease me. "I mean, if you would let me... I could..." she said, as she looked up at me.</p> <p>She wasn't able to speak, though she continued stroking me as far as I was inside of her. I was hard in no time, the anticipation in each of us. "Please," she said, "I want your cock in my mouth." She reached up and grabbed both of my hands pulling them to the side. In her hands was about eight inches of my cock, and I was half hard. "Oh, God!" she whispered, and took the head into her mouth, sucking it hungrily. As I felt the muscles of her mouth move down my penis, so I could feel even more of her tongue. My hips bucked and we both broke out in cheers. "Oh, God, this is wonderful," she said, "Yes, like that." Again, I moved my hands slowly down, over the tops of her thighs and calves. I felt the wetness on my hand, as hot as her mouth. I pressed two fingers into her pussy and began thrusting, while still pulling both my hands to the side, helping her stroke me the entire time. After a few strokes, I felt the head of my erection slide across her stomach. "Please. I..." her hand quickly covered my penis, and she moved one of my hands to my erection. Slowly she brought the other hand up near her head and began using her fingers, gently massaging me. I felt her soft hair against my balls, and then felt her soft lips, wrapped around the head of my cock. I continued to groan a bit, and she smiled as I felt her hands slide up along my shaft. As her mouth moved up and down, I could hear her whispering something, but couldn't make out exactly what it was.</p> <p>I moved one of my hands forward and began to work it into her hair. I heard her moan around me and I pulled back quickly, watching the skin of her cheeks pull tight as she drew her head up and down. I pulled back, and felt her hands on my hips. "Yes... yes, right there," I heard her say as she squeezed me, "just like that..." Slowly. She continued for a few strokes until I had a firm grip on her hair, which didn't stop her. My fingers moved through the hair that she kept close together. And then, when it came time for her to get her hands off me, I pulled her out from the arm of the couch and sat her on the end of it.
