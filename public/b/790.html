"I'll be the first to feel you cum."</p> <p>And as he did, she rolled him to his back and rolled over, sliding over and under him and pulling his arms up to wrap them around her and lay there.</p> <p>He could feel the warmth of her body as she rested her cheek on his chest. The smell of her arousal and the faint scent of her perfume wafting to their nostrils, she was his.</p> <p>He was on his back and now he was her, the first man he'd ever truly made love with.</p> <p>With her thighs tight against his hips, grinding their pelvises together as she kissed his throat and nibbled his ears. His cock was hardening with every touch of her fingers as she teased his nipples and made him feel so deliciously good.</p> <p>"I know you feel good," She murmured, as she moved up and down, riding her lover and making him feel even better with every movement of her body.</p> <p>He didn't answer her, feeling guilty over the whole situation. He'd given his feelings to his wife once before, but she hadn't taken him in her mouth like that again.</p> <p>She knew he still wanted it, she wanted it too.</p> <p>"Is there something you want?" she asked again, reaching out and taking his cock in her hand.</p> <p>He was surprised and embarrassed at the thought of her using this old cock but in his heart of hearts, he wanted her.</p> <p>"Yes... I want your wife to take your cock in her mouth," he replied, but as if to reinforce his thoughts, she slowly moved her mouth over it and ran it along the whole length of it until it pressed against her tongue again. After a moment or two of this pleasure, she took it and gently pushed his pubic hair aside so she could stroke his cock with both hands.</p> <p>As her mouth slid back up his length, she held him at the base with one hand while she used the other to cup and squeeze a breast in her hand.</p> <p>"Would you like to fuck your wife, baby?" She asked again, as she kept stroking him. "I want to see him come."</p> <p>"I guess I can do it," he said, as his erection seemed at once to harden even more at the thought of doing it.</p> <p>"Can you? I could see you would, but not in your wife."</p> <p>"You want to?" he asked, in a questioning tone because he wasn't sure if she meant what he thought she meant.</p> <p>"Yes," she replied almost immediately. "Will you fuck her?"</p> <p>"Yes," he replied, and she felt his hardness pulsing against his lower abdomen. He'd let her know that he was on the pill and she hadn't worried until now about having him use protection, he'd been right out, and he knew his wife wouldn't care if he did anyway.</p> <p>No matter, she'd get him to do it after all. He wouldn't be able to hold it back any longer. He'd want to, so much.</p> <p>"Okay, I'll go for it," he said eagerly, before she pulled away a little.</p> <p>"C'mon, baby. Fuck your wife for me, because I know I can't."</p> <p>He didn't wait for her. Before she could move, he was up her and tearing at her clothing, tearing off her panties at the same time. As soon as they were gone, he was under her on the bed on his back and she was between his legs, her face right there at his cock, looking into it intently.</p> <p>She stroked him and sucked and licked at the head, running her tongue up and down the length. She ran her tongue over the slit at the top. As he started to move and thrust his hips, she looked at him intently to let him know what he could do to make this good for her.</p> <p>He was in heaven. They were going to make passionate love and he was loving it. It felt incredible to be doing this so very much for her.</p> <p>Just a few more seconds and he knew they wouldn't be able to hold it together much longer as he got so close. As she stroked him, she moved one hand down to find and gently caress his balls.</p> <p>He felt his penis grow and stiffen, knowing she was pleased with it. He was going to make her come when she knew it would make him feel a whole lot more.</p> <p>A small moan of pleasure caught his attention. When he had first watched her do it, it had been in the dark and it had seemed so natural and yet he'd always dismissed it as a perverted act in his marriage to his wife. She was just so very beautiful.
