"I could leave off there, you see, but I can't do that while you're getting dressed. You look ridiculous."</p> <p>"Sure, but it's a shame," he said, and they moved toward their clothes.</p> <p>Laughing to himself, he stopped her and pulled her to her feet for a kiss.</p> <p>"It's a shame for what I really thought was the best thing about being here," he said and leaned against his locker. "Did I mention you look better than ever, Miss?"</p> <p>She blushed and shook her head.</p> <p>Kissing her one more time, he turned and headed toward the back room to wash his hands after he'd had a shower.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>He couldn't believe his good fortune. It was the most wonderful day of his life.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>Miss Lacy Parker was on her way back to her car. She wasn't even going home yet. She wasn't going to be able to take another walk for a while.</p> <p>She pulled to the curb and got out of her car. She didn't know why, but she found her keys on the curb. She got in her car and followed it home.</p> <p>She got to her house and went back inside.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>When she got to the door, a woman was standing there, smiling.</p> <p>"Hey Lacy," Miss Bannister said. "Come in."</p> <p>She opened the door for Lacy and led her into her apartment.</p> <p>"Where are you going?"</p> <p>"Home," Lacy said and pointed to a dark room. "This room may be a bit of a mess, Miss Parker, but it's okay if you want to go home."</p> <p>"Oh no. I'm afraid we're going to sit awhile."</p> <p>"Don't worry," Lacy said and gestured at the empty bedroom. "I had a wonderful time here."</p> <p>Miss Bannister looked at Lacy's body and saw what she was wearing. Her body was even more slender than Miss Parker's was and she felt so feminine and beautiful.</p> <p>Lacy smiled and took a seat on the bed in the middle of it.</p> <p>A hand reached out to touch her.</p> <p>"I'm sorry Lacy," a male voice said. "I hope you don't mind a girlfriend seeing your body?" it took Lacy a moment to realize that it was the voice of a guy she had never heard.</p> <p>Miss Bannister's head snapped to the side, startled, and she quickly took off her shirt and bra before looking at Lacy.</p> <p>Lacy looked away and said, "I'm sorry."</p> <p>A cock was growing between her thighs, stiffening against her inner thighs.</p> <p>"That's okay," Lacy said, and closed the door. "It's okay."</p> <p>"I'm afraid you'll want to go home," the voice said again. "I'm just trying to look presentable."</p> <p>Miss Bannister shook her head and stepped back. She was suddenly glad for what she'd just witnessed. She had expected something as strange as what she'd just experienced.</p> <p>Lacy smiled at the other man. She leaned forward and kissed him softly on the lips.</p> <p>The softness brought a smile to her face. It made her feel very feminine and wanted. It didn't seem as if she really wanted the man she just saw to be any better or more powerful than she had been.</p> <p>When her lips touched his, he gave a soft moan of approval.</p> <p>She pulled herself away.</p> <p>"What?" Lacy asked.</p> <p>"I was just wondering, would you like to see me naked again?"</p> <p>Lacy's eyes widened.</p> <p>"Miss?"</p> <p>"Yes?"</p> <p>She smiled. "I'd like to look at you, too. I mean see you nude."</p> <p>Miss Bannister looked, for what seemed like minutes, but was perhaps only a few seconds, but seemed to last a good long time.</p> <p>When Miss Bannister wasn't looking at her, Lacy looked at him. She saw his strong chest with his six-pack and the broad arms and well defined chest and legs.</p> <p>When he wasn't watching her, Lacy looked at his muscular body, down to his tight buttocks and down to the prominent erection that he was slowly becoming engâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
