"Like, what do you do? Work?"</p> <p>I could tell he was serious. I knew he would look back at me and ask, "What job are you talking about?"</p> <p>Of course nothing happened as the day wore on. A month and a half later he called from his job at the store, and told me to come over. The manager was pleased to see that I was still working at the company, and told me there was probably a big opportunity coming along. "It's not like I don't have someone to do anything about it and you'll meet someone eventually." I told him.</p> <p>"Not even on the phone?" he asked, looking a little uncertain.</p> <p>"Why not?" I asked.</p> <p>"This whole thing has me confused and at my ease. It's just not a good idea for anyone to do anything, let alone for you alone."</p> <p>I decided to cut it out if he had a problem with what he said.</p> <p>"I think that's the point, Mark," I said. "I don't want to work at a company that no-one will ever respect." Then I took his hand and pulled him to his feet. "Would you like to join me for a drink?" I could feel his eyes on me as we sat on a couch, not being able to tell if anyone else was in the room.</p> <p>I knew I looked sexy under my make-up but he was speechless, having never even considered actually having anything to drink. I didn't look back as we walked to the bar and I think he was even more surprised than I was that he had a chance with me. We went inside and sat with our drinks in hand. The way he was looking at me, watching my eyes as I slowly undid the buttons on my blouse. "So, you have a girlfriend, huh?" I said, a little surprised he hadn't thought I'd be interested in being intimate with him. "Maybe it's because there is such a shortage of men of the age." Maybe he was just having second thoughts about the age thing, I thought. If nothing else, it made me feel really sexy! "And you are very beautiful."</p> <p>I could feel his eyes slowly traveling down my body. His eyes lingered on my breasts that he felt were just pushing hard against the fabric of my bra as I sat. "Can I see your breasts? Please?" he asked, his voice a little husky. I knew he thought I was sexy, and was probably just as turned on as I was.</p> <p>I leaned back and looked him directly in the eyes. "Go ahead." I told him. Then I slid off my shirt and slowly lifted it over my head. He was watching me and not taking his eyes off me, and when he reached behind me to unhook my bra, I quickly told him to leave my shirt on.</p> <p>My breasts were a little fuller than he would have liked but it was hardly that he would be able to see my body. I had an hourglass figure, and when I bent over to reach behind to unhook the clasp of my skirt he was able to see a lot of my breasts. I'm not sure he even heard me but I was in control and if he made any kind of protest, I'd just make him stop. I finished with the clasp on my skirt and tossed it across the back of the chair. He didn't protest, and I'm sure if he had, he would have found himself staring at my body in my bra. Now that he knew I wasn't wearing panties, I could feel his eyes wandering all over my body. He definitely liked what he saw. I pulled my hands down and slowly slid off my panties. I looked over my shoulder at him and said, "Come with me."</p> <p>I took his hand and guided him to the bar. I was still slightly self-conscious about my breasts being so out of proportion but to my pleasure it was actually a good job I got him to go for a walk instead of going back for a beer. As he left the bar, I was still feeling very uncomfortable, and just wanted to get away. "Can I go?" I asked in a shaky voice. He didn't answer, and I knew my chance had really come. He walked back to me. After we were standing in the middle of my office area, me leaning against him, he started to kiss me again. Then I felt his hand run up my leg. He didn't go that far, but I didn't push him away, nor did I try to stop him, because of my desire to be able to feel his body against me, no one wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
