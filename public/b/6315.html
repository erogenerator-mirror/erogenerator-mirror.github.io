We drank a few shots then I said I was thirsty and I had to pee.</p> <p>I got up and went to the bathroom.</p> <p>I returned two minutes later, naked.</p> <p>"I have to pee too," she smiled. "And I thought you might like to watch me pee."</p> <p>She came in and sat down with me. My cock had become stiff in an instant as I watched her piss.</p> <p>"I feel a bit like a gusher," she said, "like you were holding an open condom on."</p> <p>She flushed the toilet and I watched her go. Then, turning to me, "You are beautiful. I love to watch urinating."</p> <p>"Thank you, and I'm glad it's not me," I said.</p> <p>She took my hand and put it on her breast, "So what kind of a man would want to look at another man's girlfriend peeing all over a hot tub with a stranger?"</p> <p>"Some women are just that," I said.</p> <p>"How many women do you think there is inside there?" she asked.</p> <p>"I think there are only two that I'd know."</p> <p>"Would you be able to handle both?"</p> <p>"It depends on what the other is like?"</p> <p>"Maybe you could, but I'd love to watch her."</p> <p>"And you couldn't see that from the side, could you, if you were standing over her?"</p> <p>"That wouldn't do, would it?"</p> <p>"Maybe not, but we could watch each others face."</p> <p>She smiled and stood up to pull her thong off.</p> <p>"Let's see what we can do," he said.</p> <p>I moved forward, reached in my briefs and released my erect cock. I held it in my hand and watched as her hand moved up and down on my cock. Her mouth opened and she sucked hard on the head. She pulled her lips off me and looked up, "Is this what you want, Tom?" she said as she moved towards me. "If I wanted to, would you make love to me?"</p> <p>Then she said, "Let's find out," and took off her clothes again. Naked, she climbed on to the spa tub and took me inside. She lowered herself onto me, and then began to fuck me. Not that I want to say much for the first session, just enjoying what she was doing. This was so erotic. Not knowing what might happen next, but I got off a lot just watching her as she looked up at me with loving eyes. She looked over my shoulder at me.</p> <p>"Do you mind if I use a bit of suntan oil?" she asked, grinning.</p> <p>I nodded and reached for the bottle. She leaned back on the tub, and put a cushion under me. Then turned to me and told me what she wanted. I watched as she poured oil over my cock. I closed my eyes and tried not to think of what I would have done, if I was watching. When she finished, she took the bottle of suntan oil and poured some on her hand. Then, standing beside me with her hands on my shoulders, she spread the bottle of nary a bit.</p> <p>"Do you like me naked?" she asked, "I'm the one in the hot tub with you. I may not mind."</p> <p>"I would love to watch," I said.</p> <p>But I kept thinking of the time she brought this up, and the things she would like to do. I knew that wasn't exactly going to happen. She would be standing in front of me, her legs open and I could see her beautiful cunt, and her hands were everywhere on my body, touching me, caressing me.</p> <p>"Would you like to touch me?" she asked slowly.</p> <p>I looked at her and she nodded her head as she slid her hand down to my cock. One finger touched me lightly, just as the other she pushed inside me and I lifted my hips so she could do it all. I wanted to say something, but didn't want to break into the moment. I opened my eyes and saw her looking at me as she caressed my cock, and her eyes were full of love and desire.</p> <p>She put more oil on her hand and began to slowly rub my cock. It wasn't long before she started to increase in speed. I began to feel the pleasure in my balls but I wasn't really sure this was the right time to tell her I did. She asked me, "Can I touch you?"</p> <p>I didn't answer, I couldn't. It was all that was on my mind. She continued to rub me.</p> <p>As she got faster and faster, the sensation of her hand against my cock was exciting me, exciting me even moreâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
