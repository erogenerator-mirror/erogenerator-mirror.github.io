I thought about it."</p> <p>"Well go on, we will have a good time."</p> <p>"So, how's about I get the boys here and then have them go out on their dates?"</p> <p>"Okay. That works," I lied as she left to change.</p> <p>The next week I went out to dinner with Jason and Brad and I noticed that Jason kept glancing at my legs all the damn time as he took quick notes.</p> <p>I have to admit that it was very flattering. They had all wanted me but I was always stuck with them. I still wore my short black skirt that reached half way to my knees which gave me an instant view of my shapely calf. I was 5'1", 140 lbs and really fit, in a way that didn't seem out of place. I didn't need a bra or panties in my day off. If I had known my size I would have thought of a reason to go to the tanning salon to get a tan.</p> <p>I met Brad about a month after we had moved in to our new family and my dad was coming on his date, so I went home to my parent's. I don't think he was looking at me at first but when he saw me he got a big smile on his face, and I'm sure it was because he wasn't looking at me as he drove towards our house to get me. He just stared at me with a mixture of lust and curiosity. It was time for him to see me and I was nervous about being seen, but also excited that he was watching me.</p> <p>We all went into the house and I turned on the television. Jason came into the kitchen with food in his arms while Brad and I took our stuff out of the car. We had taken a lot of stuff off our list when it came to food and I guess we just didn't want to lose it. "Okay", I said as I walked to the table. I sat down with Jason and he sat down and picked up a few of the pieces of fruit from the table to start with.</p> <p>I was shocked when he put this all in our salad and put some on a plate for Brad and I. Then he pulled his salad from the side of the table along with a piece of bread. He sat down next to me and picked up a piece of bread and put the piece in my mouth. "Mmmm", I said as I licked my lips. "It's good".</p> <p>We all went to the backyard where we had gone for a barbecue earlier and sat down.</p> <p>"So how old is your mom?", Brad asked.</p> <p>"She was 34", I said as I handed him the piece of bread.</p> <p>"Well I want to know" replied Brad, the same as Jason</p> <p>"How old is she", I asked.</p> <p>"It was at 37" said Jason.</p> <p>"What! And you wanted to go with us in your house!", I said as I stared at Jason.</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess you are. We are the most adventurous people in the world. I love the fact that you're a boy and I'm a girl,"</p> <p>"Wow, don't you guys like to play?", It was the first time Brad ever used the word female. I looked at his crotch and saw that his cock was very hard because he was trying to hide it. I know that some of it was the alcohol talking but I couldn't help noticing that it was a big one. I saw his stomach quiver slightly and I knew he was on the verge of bursting.</p> <p>"I guess we do", said Brad sheepishly.</p> <p>I could see his cock getting a bit smaller. "Well," I said in a slow voice which caused an immediate jump from him as if we hadn't spoken. It's not every boy that can get it up when they see you wearing a skirt and you can't help but be turned on."</p> <p>I saw that he had a little erection but it was gone in an instant when Brad looked at me and my face. It was a mixture of shock and anger. So I said, "What the hell. Is there any chance of me getting turned on by being a boy? I am your mother and my only son. Can't you just stop it?!"</p> <p>"Hell no! I've thought about it," replied Brad. "Are you sure? Are you sure that you are comfortable with that?"</p> <p>"My mom is cool and I will be cool. She'll love it because her only son can get it up for her. Hell she may even like the idea of me being an attractive boy. That kind of goes for everything from being a woman to being a guy. Is there any thing else?" I didn't believe that I was going to sayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
