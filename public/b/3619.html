I feel guilty about cheating on you like that, and I would say I should talk to my wife. I just wish I could talk to her and tell her the truth."</p> <p>She took a sip of her wine, as if to let her brain clear somewhat. She wasn't about to tell anyone else.</p> <p>"How about if I talk to you after this is over? I'll be totally honest with you."</p> <p>"Sure. I'll take that chance." "Now, take your coat off. You look great. I'll make a light lunch for us." "You know that I love this outfit anyway. You look great too; I can't say this is a one-time thing."</p> <p>"Why? You're going to keep cheating on me?"</p> <p>"I wouldn't cheat on you. I'd be the same way with you."</p> <p>"I don't understand. I can't say that in front of you."</p> <p>"It is what it is.

"See you in the morning."</p> <p>He turned to go and turned back again, his hand coming to a stop on the hem of her skirt. Then he started to walk away and stopped again. She followed, her hand still on his arm.</p> <p>"No you don't, sweetheart," he said. "We have to eat. Eat something, please."</p> <p>"I know. I'll just watch."</p> <p>They stood and ate a couple of bites of pizza, then headed out on the street. He looked back to her and said, "Come on, I want you to come to my apartment one time, to stay in my bed for an entire weekend. I want you in front of me, so much that you can't walk straight. I really want to fuck you, but I'm not going to take my clothes off."</p> <p>She looked at him funny and then walked with him to his car. She unlocked his door, opened it and stepped back inside.
