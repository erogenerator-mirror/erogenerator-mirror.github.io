Not yet.</p> <p>We need to talk a lot, honey."</p> <p>"We need to talk a lot, baby," I replied as I began to undress. "I want that first kiss."</p> <p>We kissed, our tongues intertwining as I unzipped her blouse and removed her blouse from her shoulders. Her soft tits fell out of their restraint and my touch ignited an urgent longing inside me that I couldn't help but feel. I reached behind her and unsnapped my shorts and pulled my cock out as she pulled her blouse off over her head.</p> <p>When she fell back onto the bed I pushed my cock into her pussy in one quick stroke. Our bodies locked together as the sensation of our bodies pressed together became even more intense. Our fingers tangled as I began to increase the speed, feeling the sensation change with each stroke.</p> <p>I was on a mission. I wanted to make this night as long as I could, but I just couldn't seem to stop myself. She pulled my face to hers and we kissed as we felt each other in our arms. My hands stroked her thighs and butt and each time a flash of pleasure or pain would send my mind racing with pleasure. We kissed as if in an age old tradition as I caressed her legs, her thighs, all over my face. One of her bare feet touched my cheek, brushing my cheek. I opened my eyes slightly and saw her staring directly into my eyes as if there was no way I could resist her. The fire in her eyes burned an incredible red. Her legs squeezed my arms tighter and her chest heaved as her whole body writhed in the throws of an intense orgasm that tore through her.</p> <p>Her body quivered uncontrollably as she fell back into the bed. Her body was drenched in perspiration as she trembled. I could feel the bed tremble even more. I began to move my hips as I plunged my fully erect cock into her as far as it could go.</p> <p>"Oh, my God, Baby," she whispered.</p> <p>As my balls slapped against her ass, I knew I was going to cum. I lifted her legs up to my shoulders and began thrusting hard and fast. My hands held her legs still as she wrapped her strong legs around mine and her fingers dug into my skin.</p> <p>"Oh, God," she groaned. "I'm coming again, and again, and again, honey. It feels so good in there."</p> <p>The feelings she was feeling were overwhelming. She wrapped her legs tighter around my body and held me tight to her. Her head rocked back and forth as the orgasm took her. I felt the rush of semen filling my cock as it bursted inside her, pulsing against her belly.</p> <p>We lay there until we calmed. She rolled away and snuggled up close.</p> <p>"I've wanted your body for so long," she said as her face took on a dreamy expression. "So long."</p> <p>"I guess we should go to bed," I said as we both drifted off to the sound of our soft snoring.</p> <p>"Yes," she said. "We have to."</p> <p>I lay there, feeling the sexual energy flowing through my body, my cock throbbing hard, as it began to slip from the warmth of her vagina.</p> <p>She slipped into bed with me. The warmth of our bodies pressed together on the bed felt so good. My left arm was around her waist as hers was around mine. It was as if we needed that closeness now.</p> <p>The first thing we exchanged was a kiss. It was just the two of us again. I kissed her lips softly. She kissed my nose in return. Her tongue teased my own. Her lips opened and her tongue probed my mouth. The sensual connection we had on the nightstand was stronger.</p> <p>"I'm not sure how this is going to turn out," she said as she broke away from me.</p> <p>"You're not going to blame yourself if it doesn't. You look fantastic and you feel incredible," I replied as I lifted one of her legs to my hip and brought my lips to hers.</p> <p>Our mouths found each other. I pushed my tongue into her mouth and held the kiss tight. Our tongues danced and twirled while our hands roamed each other's backs and stomachs. A soft groan escaped our lips that was all that existed to make the moment last.
