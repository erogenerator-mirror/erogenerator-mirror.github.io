She said, sounding like a shy woman.</p> <p>I just shrugged at her and let her see the truth of my situation. I had decided that I would leave the party with this lovely woman.</p> <p>"Can we go back to my room now?" She asked.</p> <p>"I think that I would better if you did." I told her.</p> <p>She nodded and walked away, which meant that she would need my help to get back to her room. I felt like an idiot though and I felt a little of the humiliation rising in me again.</p> <p>As we got up to my room I found that it was a little warmer, in fact, it almost felt like it could have been even harder. I stripped down and laid on the bed, as I lay there trying to stay warm. I had a hard time getting comfortable and even though the room felt warm, it was not comfortable enough to be comfortable. I had trouble falling asleep and was surprised when it was a bit later than it should have been. The thought of seeing Jenny again would be very uncomfortable for a virgin, so I needed a strong emotional attachment to my sister... to find out what she was really like.</p> <p>I was really getting worried about what was going on in her room - I felt like I would have to be her protector and protector. It was becoming harder and harder to think of what had happened and what she was going to do to me in the future.</p> <p>When the night came, Jenny seemed to be in a good mood. Maybe she had been drinking a little. And my worries were starting to get the best of me. I really didn't want to look at my girlfriend again, even though I really wanted to. The truth came back to me.</p> <p>"Hey, are you in a bad mood," Jenny asked, looking up at me, "are you a virgin still?"</p> <p>I looked at her, not believing my eyes. She didn't look like a teenager anymore. She looked more like a twenty year old again, with her long brown hair still loose and hanging down to her shoulders. She wore a pair of jogging shorts and a loose fitting white t-shirt that was stretched pretty tight against her.</p> <p>"Well, actually..." I started.</p> <p>"Oh, my, that's a bit too much information." Jenny said, her voice starting to turn slurred from the drink she had been drinking so heavily. "It's okay. You didn't ask."</p> <p>"I should apologize." I admitted. "I don't drink that much anymore so I'm pretty wasted. I think I needed a drink to feel this way... I guess... I'd never have been the kind to let anything hurt like this."</p> <p>"Don't worry about it." Jenny said. "There's nothing you can tell me that can't get a guy hard."</p> <p>"What?" I asked and started looking around the room.</p> <p>"No, there's nothing that I can tell you that you can tell me that's any more than that." Jenny insisted. "Myself and most of the guys here have made some changes, but the best thing that I can do is to tell you that it didn't cause you any trouble at all."</p> <p>"Well... thank you for your honesty..." I began as I lay there trying to take the weight off my shoulders and relax.</p> <p>"Please don't go to sleep on me." Jenny said and stood up. She started to put on her robe, while I started up the stairs and started to get up myself. She came over to me and put her arms around me and leaned into me, her face pressed into my chest.</p> <p>"I'll get you some of that, too." She said with a sweet smile and then took me by the hand and led me to her room.</p> <p>I followed her, watching her ass as her ass led me upstairs. Her house was a very nice one. We went into her room, which had a queen sized bed in the middle of it, which had a huge red comforter and a dresser on the other side of it. It had a desk on a white wooden desk and a dresser on a green wooden desk. She had her back to the wall and we could both see the television on her computer in a small closet.</p> <p>"Do you want me to put the sheets on your bed?" She asked, turning around.</p> <p>I smiled and nodded. "You should definitely put those too." She said and turned around, stretching her long legs out over the bed.</p> <p>So far, it looked like she was in a really good mood this evening.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>It started as pretty much normal. We went to bed in our normal, comfortable positions. Just barely there and just lying in each other's arms. We didn't kiss or anything; it wasn't as awkwardâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
