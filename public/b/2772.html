My panties had been soaking through. He'd managed to get them off by his own hand and was now fingering me from behind with the panties in my mouth. The sight was hot and making my head spin as I licked him again, while my hand found my soaking cunt. My own pleasure had left a wet patch on my shorts. David groaned as he moved down, taking me on his lap. "You're gonna taste good," he said. I whimpered at the thought, but his mouth went to work. He licked and sucked at my tits and pussy and my fingers were already in my body. I was on the edge of exploding.</p> <p>"Let me in my panties," I hissed. He needed no more incentive. He moved to slide them off in between my soaking wet legs but I stopped him. I wanted attention. I needed to feel his mouth on my clit. I guided his hand to my pussy and let him guide him, stroking as best I could. He teased my outer lips as he pushed his middle finger into me just a bit and withdrew. It slid inside easily. I moaned again and tried to make myself orgasm. I moved my hips back and forth as he finger fucked me as he sucked on my clit. I came, screaming into David's mouth and he groaned into mine.</p> <p>His hand on my thigh was all I needed. I went to him, wanting to suck the juices from his cock but he stopped me. He rolled me over and mounted me. I couldn't wait until he slid inside me. I tried to ride him as he rode me but we didn't have room for any more. David had me laying on my back on the sofa. He got between my legs and slid my shorts off. They were around my ankles so he quickly took off his shorts and knelt between my widely spread legs.</p> <p>"My turn," I said. I rolled David over, got atop the sofa and straddled him. He quickly slid inside me. "Your first!" I screamed. He groaned beneath me. I rocked my hips back and forth, fucking him to the edge of an orgasm. He grabbed my hips and began to push inside me again, as I bounced and rode on top of him. He pushed farther and pulled me down with him. He grabbed my tits and sucked at them one after the other. I rode his cock, feeling it slide deep inside me. I was on fire. I could tell from his grip I was also on fire -- he had me so turned-on I almost came myself. My insides were on fire, and they made wet slapping sounds as we slammed. I knew neither of us could hold out forever so I turned back to David and began to slam and bounce atop him again, making the couch squeak under me. I moved a hair behind David, grabbed his wrist and pulled. He was up in a rush. We started to cum together. David groaned as I milked his cock, as my inner muscles massaged each jet of his cum as it spurted into me. I was lost in a world of pleasure and need. Our voices were lost as we climaxed. We came together as I bounced up and down. Cumming on the other one, David came on me, mixing with the spasms. He leaned against me, feeling my heartbeat pulsing in his chest as he held me so tightly.</p> <p>He kissed my cheek and whispered, "You're so fucking sexy." His fingers were still playing with my nipples while I rested on top of him, feeling his hardness in my body. "I wanted this to be special for you," I whispered. He laughed and rubbed my clit. "Mmmm... we're definitely going to have trouble getting enough time to do this again in a couple months." We laid against the couch, breathing heavily and stroking each other's backs. David's fingers returned to my clit and he brought me over again. "David," I said, "Let me ask a favor. Do you mind if David kisses you? Like you said, I want to make you feel good again, don't you love me for that?" All the way back to my bed I thought he could still hear the conversation from their earlier session, but he seemed less likely. "I can't do that," I added. "I am married," I added. "We're not in love." A wave of disappointment rolled over me. How could I think of that? "David, I'm ready to make a move if you are. Don't feel bad," I promised. I kissed him softly. "If you want, when you get home from work, I can go all day with David." I kissed him again. "David, I'm so glad you were able to give David pleasure," I murmured. "Why don't you go tell him you're taking a week off? I understandâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
