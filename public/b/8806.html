I decided no was the better word to try to come to terms with it and, more importantly, that she had to be my best friend. I had never been so excited about any relationship before and, when it came to her, I wasn't sure what to do.</p> <p>That night when we had had sex in the hotel suite I had always been in charge, the way I was during sex. I looked at her face and saw the question in her eyes, "Do you want to have a relationship with me?"</p> <p>"Yes!" she exclaimed and then, "But what if I didn't want a relationship with you?"</p> <p>"Maybe we could just find a way to sort things out," I said with a sheepish grin on my face.</p> <p>"I'm not sure I want to do that," she agreed as she looked at me with a pensive look on her face.</p> <p>"Yes," I said and then, "I suppose it is possible," and then, "But why are you asking? I don't want to fuck you, I don't want to fuck you because you are my best friend."</p> <p>Her eyes had gone up to mine and then she looked at me as she took a deep breath and said, "If you want to have a relationship with me then you have to at least try, I thought you should too."</p> <p>I knew that it was stupid of me to get into that position. However, I wasn't about to stop her because that would have been as much as something we could deal with. So, the only thing that I said was, "Yes." and then, "Ok."</p> <p>"I like the sound of that," she said as she slid out of bed and walked to the bathroom and then came back into the bedroom. "How about you? How about you let me see your body?"</p> <p>"Yes," I replied with a smile on my face.</p> <p>"That's so nice of you," she added as she reached out and took my hand and pulled me toward her. I moved toward her and lay down beside her. As soon as we were together we began to kiss.</p> <p>That night though, things were different. We didn't keep the sex between us. There was always some sexual activity afterwards and it was still new to her. "You have to do what happens?" she asked as we embraced and kissed.</p> <p>"When you wake up," I explained, "I wake up."</p> <p>"But," she asked, "I don't really know you anymore."</p> <p>"This is different," I said, "This has been real."</p> <p>"I agree," she said, "but what are you wearing?"</p> <p>"I'm still in my shorts and shirt," I told her.</p> <p>"If you wear your shorts you could look like a swim suit," she said. I was shocked and then surprised as I stared at her standing there in her robe as she stood there. Then, as a second shock came to my body I saw she wasn't wearing her robe but what she wasn't wearing. She was naked beneath it and the sight thrilled me because of the thought of me seeing her naked. It thrilled me more than I thought I would and, more importantly, I liked it and so, too, did she. I couldn't stand it for long. I had to see more. In fact, I needed a shower, I needed to be naked with her and I needed to pee.</p> <p>I had never been naked in front of a girl before that day, I'm sure not even on my first day. Maybe that explains what you see when you walk in a room wearing something from your home town and you have to strip while you are in the presence of your best friend and I get to see your bare ass and your naked pussy and your bare nipple.</p> <p>I had never done anything like this before and the thought of it brought me to an immediate orgasm right there in the shower stall. It wasn't the feeling of being naked with my best friend that I had in the past, but it was the thought of it that I could not hold back. In my mind it was just a thought that came to my mind. I couldn't stop thinking that I could see her naked breasts and I couldn't stop thinking of her nipples erect and aroused. I was shocked at that thought and could do nothing to stop it. I felt like I had to pee. I had to look.</p> <p>When the water felt wonderful I got out and, once again, I saw the door to my bedroom was slightly open so I decided to get out and go and see if she was even there. I opened the door and was shocked that she was there. She looked completely different than she did the last time I saw her.
