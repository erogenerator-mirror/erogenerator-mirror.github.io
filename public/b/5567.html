"So you're a fan of the Aussie, how did you manage to snag his girlfriend and your son?"</p> <p>I'm always ready for that kind of a response, "No, not really. Oh, I just wanted to say that he's in good hands. But I know that he's always been a little shy around girls, but it's not like I'm gonna be his Mom."</p> <p>She gave me another smile and a giggle. "I'm getting to that, so enjoy the ride."</p> <p>She leaned over and kissed me softly on the neck. "I do." She looked over to Tim, who was looking at us funny.</p> <p>"Wow, now you know what you're going to have." Said Tony, and he was smiling at Tim as Tim looked at him and gave a big wink.</p> <p>We got to cruising altitude when the plane began to growl, Tim called after us and said that our flight would be ending in about 3 hours. "Well, that sucks... I'm getting tired right now and I can't believe that we're going to have to wait another three days."</p> <p>"Yeah, and the same with me." Said Tim. All three began to walk towards us and then stopped in to the back of the plane. "So, did his girlfriend say something to you?"</p> <p>It must have come on pretty strong, because it took us by the elbow and began to walk towards the back of the plane.</p> <p>"Yeah, and if I had a girlfriend like yours would I be giving you such a shit-eating grin?"</p> <p>She was all over Tim. "Uh huh! I don't know why I feel that way!"</p> <p>They walked towards the back room where the other people were and we walked in. We found the room and began to undress, while the rest of the flight had passed us. We entered the room, and had a seat each just to the right of where we would be sleeping, when we heard a noise outside. We looked over, as the door opened and Tim walked out. He came back with a towel draped over his shoulders. He came back into the room with her and Tim knelt next to her and wrapped her hands about his waist and laid his hands on her bare legs.</p> <p>I could tell that he was breathing slowly and deeply through the nose, because he was starting to come hard in her little body. He stopped breathing and looked at me. "Hey, come here."</p> <p>"No," I said. My head shook.</p> <p>He leaned towards her and licked at the top of her neck.</p> <p>"Oh, Tim..." she said. She had a cute little smile.</p> <p>He reached the bottom and he pulled her tight against him to hug her while he was still hard and still rubbing her leg with one hand.</p> <p>I could see that he had a semi hard cock, but was not the biggest I'd ever felt. "Tim, you're... I'm surprised that you're not already naked."</p> <p>"Uh huh." He pulled her shirt off and looked down at her chest. "You're still as naked as the day I walked in here with my cock in your hand."</p> <p>"So, you can't get any wood off of me?"</p> <p>"Yes, that was exactly what I was hoping for."</p> <p>"I need this dick."</p> <p>"Uh huh."</p> <p>He leaned down and slipped her black panties to the floor, while he started sucking on her left tit.</p> <p>She leaned against him with his hands now on her ass and was starting to rub her hips against him again. I could tell that he loved that, and his face was starting to get pretty flushed.</p> <p>After a few seconds of that, he stood up and got his shorts off. He picked her up and carried her onto the bed and sat her down on the bed so that she was on her back. My cock was so hard it was hurting.</p> <p>I couldn't believe that I saw her. She was beautiful, and had a real sex appeal that is so much hotter than her brother and I did before. But as I watched all she did was wrap her legs tightly around him and grind her pussy against his throbbing hard cock.</p> <p>Her face had turned red and had a huge smile on it. She opened her eyes and turned to look at me and said: "Come and fuck me!"</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Fuck me, baby. I need you inside of me!"</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>I thought about it for a minute. "Oh wait, that's not what I wanted to hear!"</p> <p>"Yeah," she said. "I wanted to feel you inside me."</p> <p>He smiled and began to move inside of her.</p> <p>She wrapped her legs around him and wrapped her arms around his neck as she threw her long hair around him. He leaned down and bit her nipple and sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
