I was thinking about how I wanted to just hold her and watch her cum. Instead I turned to look at her and said, "If I get hard just looking at your tits and pussy you might really enjoy this."</p> <p>She stood up, walked to her clothes basket and pulled me to my feet by the hands that still had a hold on my wife's dress. I could see her looking at my dick and it was quickly pushing against my dress. When she had pulled it up to my waist I put my arms around her and gave her a short kiss before she had a chance get my pants down.</p> <p>We got into the car before anybody got out and headed to the house. When all the guys that knew me knew that I was looking down and my wife had pulled my cock so hard it hurt. I'm not sure if my mouth was working or just how long it had been stretched. Finally the car pulled out and the three of us climbed out and got into the driver's side. When they were sure that all the guys were gone we started up the drive toward the hotel.</p> <p>When we got to the room and saw that there was no one else in the room we went straight to the bar and ordered a drink. When it arrived we were both too far gone to even know what the hell had happened.</p> <p>When we got back to the room and found that it was almost 10 in the morning we both decided that we were going to try to get some sleep before we went to the airport. We both stripped off our clothes and climbed into bed with the lights off and started to slowly and gently ease them off. Neither of us wore a gown either and we were both now naked. When it was time for bed we lay side by side and we each slowly and gently caressed our breasts as it got to where we could each play with the other in a most comfortable way.</p> <p>We were both in the midst of an amazing orgasm when the doorbell rang and before she closed the door I leaned over and put my hand on her chest and whispered, "We really did get to work." It wasn't until I slid my fingers inside the top of her robe and touched the nipple that she said, "Damn, you still had me going, didn't you."</p> <p>"Yeah...I was hard at the thought of fucking you that night."</p> <p>"What a wonderful time we had...my husband had to take me to bed to make sure I hadn't been too sore and he did that a lot. I guess I could have taken it easy if my legs were a bit too much."</p> <p>"What were you feeling, like I did?" she said and then started to giggle. By the end of it she had been so wet that all that talk and feeling made me feel quite good.</p> <p>"I thought your pussy was hot. You could have been hotter back then."</p> <p>"Did you get my pussy all wet, like when we were talking about me coming on your husband?" There were other times than those for her to make them hot and now she had a definite glow in them that I wasn't familiar with. "That was so fantastic."</p> <p>"I'd put my finger up your anus to feel how it would be. Did you do it again, once more? If you did it that time then I'd have made you come."</p> <p>"You sure? I had my legs spread and my pussy so ready that your thing was already up inside me."</p> <p>"Yeah and if I do that again I had you come on my cock."</p> <p>"Good. I knew you did when that doorbell rang."</p> <p>This time I sat up and looked over her shoulder to see that it had gotten to her and with my finger the finger still sticking up her ass, she had come, right there and then.</p> <p>I kissed my wife saying, "I wish that were for real. Let me get you a towel." When she came back with the towel I slipped my finger up and moved it back and forth over her lips. When she licked my finger I whispered into her ear, "You taste better when you just had your finger up your ass."</p> <p>"Why does it seem important that we do this every time?"</p> <p>"That's because your husband knows that a lot of the time with me and you is different, but you'll see when you get around to the bed." We sat for a moment and then she sat down and we lay back.</p> <p>Once our breath got back to normal we smiled at one another with our hands on each other and drifted off to sleep.</p> <p>******</p> <p>If you liked this story and wish to hear any of my thoughts on the next one, please take a moment to vote and/or leave a comment.
