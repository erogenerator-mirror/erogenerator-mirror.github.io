"</p> <p>I was so excited and so ready to explode. How many times had I been made aware of how excited I was getting to have my cock buried and to have her pussy stuffed. I could feel the warm blood pumping in my cock through and out as I began to move harder and faster. In and out, over and over till I was coming as well.</p> <p>I was gasping for breath now, my head spinning with pleasure. She had never looked so beautiful!</p> <p>She lay on the bed, panting, her eyes closed in her post-orgasmic bliss.</p> <p>"My God that was wonderful."</p> <p>Ohh, sweet. I'll be honest. It sure as hell didn't feel like she took my cock any differently than she did mine when it was in her mouth.</p> <p>I kissed her, tasting my precum which she tasted. "I am sorry that this happened." I whispered. "I hope I didn't hurt you."</p> <p>Her eyes opened and she laughed softly, "You didn't hurt me." Her mouth covered mine and we kissed.</p> <p>We lay there together, naked, catching our breath again.</p> <p>"Merry Christmas." She said.</p> <p>"I will have some things for you for Christmas.</p> <p>She rolled over so that she was on top. "Oh no!" she cried. "You know no condoms."</p> <p>"Yes, I do, believe me." She said kissing me. "You feel so good, don't you?"</p> <p>She turned so that she faced me and began moving her hips. "I hope you don't feel guilty about this, though."</p> <p>It turned me on, and I watched fascinated as her big, firm breasts jiggled as she fucked me.</p> <p>"Do you want another baby?"</p> <p>"I don't know. I haven't had one yet."</p> <p>"How about you if I fuck it?"</p> <p>"It is going to be another two weeks!" I was surprised.</p> <p>"Do you want to fuck me one last time after that?"</p> <p>"That would be great!"</p> <p>"But if it doesn't work for you, we should start again."</p> <p>She rolled over and lay next to me, running her fingers through my hair and squeezing my hands. "God you are so hard."</p> <p>I laughed, "I love it when you talk like that."</p> <p>"I'll do it any time you want!" She kissed me. "But I might not let you. "</p> <p>"You're on," I said, thinking of what I could possibly do to her that eveningâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
