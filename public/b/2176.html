The feeling of being deep inside a woman he thought he could never have, was something he would never live without. And it was not just the warm fuzzy feeling of the tight channel between a woman's legs that excited him as much as it did having her so naked, it was the way she took control without a thought.</p> <p>He had also never been this close to an experience in his life. There was no other man or woman that he had ever been with. Never, had it been made even a little more exciting simply by the feel of a woman's body being pressed against his own. Yet, not only had he had the most perfect feeling of a woman's body pressed against his, he had never felt anything like that before. He could just touch her. Kiss her and feel the softness of her skin on his. As with the first time they had sex, and with the first time they did something wild and daring, there was a special thrill to it that he could never fully explore and experience for himself. Now he had an experience he would never be able to describe.</p> <p>As he got closer, he could feel his stomach clench as his penis felt the first tingle of his orgasm in weeks. The tingle became more intense, the more urgent, until he found himself moving even closer to his own release. His hips bucked, spasming and jerking as he fought to hold back. He had never felt his semen shoot so far up inside a woman, then there was this tingle that left him feeling like it was going to never end. His hand was numb, his knuckles turning white. He knew he had been masturbating too. He'd had too much beer before, he told himself.</p> <p>As the waves of ecstasy rolled over him, one after the other, his hand moved a bit faster on his penis, wanting to prolong the wonderful sensations that were running along his body as his orgasm hit the peak just as rapidly. He had no idea how long it was that he held out, but within seconds, he was coming to several more climaxes that were just the most incredible feeling he'd ever experienced. His mind was a blank and his body was completely and completely focused on the experience of his orgasm. He was never in the same place at the same time two, three or more times, in a row, one after the other. Never in a million years would he have thought that such an orgasm would really be felt like this. Not that he'd ever had, even though his mother warned him, he was sure that if he ever came in this position for a reason, the experience would be even stronger with some form of orgasmic overload.</p> <p>When he came to, he realized that he was alone, that he was standing between two women that he was seeing on every conceivable planet in the heavens. He had never even thought of himself as a lesbian, but then again, if you found a lesbian lover, why would you find yourself attracted to women who were also attracted to men? Why wouldn't a man really want to kiss his woman, to touch a woman intimately, and to kiss her passionately, because at least this was a man who wanted to. How often does one want to walk into the same room and be confronted in the same way as another man that you and he are attracted to?</p> <p>He had never thought he could be in love with another man. It was just the thought of her standing there looking at him, naked and vulnerable to all this attention. He never realized, and if he had to be stupid, that he could fall for her. Maybe she was right, maybe he really was some kind of a lesbian. Maybe he should start asking her to marry him, and go to a club with him on Valentine's Day, and then come out to her and tell her just how much he loved her. He never seemed to be able to get the thought out of his mind.</p> <p>He reached up and kissed her, his eyes going wide for a second. Then he reached down to find a towel wrapped around him, which he tossed over his shoulder and ran to the bathroom. Sitting on the toilet, he took his erection out and felt it as it pulsed in the warm water. He could feel his own sexual excitement in his naked skin.</p> <p>He had never been as excited as he was at that moment. His penis felt hard and slick at the sensation. He took another washcloth and cleaned his penis, cleaning with the soapy warmness of the towel. He could feel himself getting stiff again. He looked at his own body for the first time. In truth, he had never been as attracted to anyone in his life as he was to her. His body was trembling at the sight. But then, she was right there, standing beside him, watching him and taking the time to give him a private performance he never even thought could possibly be done inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
