My pussy was so close, and his cock was so hard. I kissed him again, and kissed him again, our tongues entwined, hands squeezing and caressing our hot bodies. Then he pulled me up, and kissed me again, a little harder this time. This time, our tongues probed each other, and his hand stroked my pussy. I moaned my approval. He held my pussy gently, and slowly rubbed my clit as he kissed me, gently at first, but soon with a passion. I was panting from a combination of the excitement between us, and the excitement of being so close to a new man. We kissed again, then I whispered, "Take me upstairs, and fuck me."</p> <p>He lay me down, and his mouth took over. He pulled my tits out of my bra, and sucked on my nipples, biting them gently as he moved his hand between my legs to make contact with my wetness. It felt marvelous, and I just wanted one more kiss, but then we were making out, and my hand went back to his cock, feeling what my heart could make his. I pushed him up against the wall again, and we kissed again for a long time, me fingering his cock as I rubbed my sopping pussy on his crotch, feeling the warmth and hardness of his hardness. We had both had too much, and needed to calm down. With a sigh, we broke our kiss.</p> <p>"You know, you can have my ass," I whispered in his ear. I had made a suggestion. He had never tried it before, and I really didn't want him to, so I figured why not do it now. He looked at me, with a big smile.</p> <p>"I think I'll get that," he said, smiling broadly, as he pulled me up, and kissed me again. His hands had found their way to my hot cunt, so there was nothing else to me. I was still wet from getting fucked by this man, and I was surprised that my pussy didn't burn a hole in his fingers. Instead, I felt his fingers slide inside me, and they were in me easily, as I was so wet, and so turned on. I was glad that someone had found it easy, and then again, I was glad that a lot of people's wives weren't the sort to get into it with their boyfriends.</p> <p>"Are you ready?" asked Peter, as his fingers continued where they were, and slipped inside me. As he said it, I knew right there that this wasn't a one-time thing, and I'd never be able to do with anyone. It was all for another time.</p> <p>"I can't wait," I whispered back to him, not looking up. Peter was sitting on a bench in front of a mirror on a wall. He stared at my pussy, and I could tell he could probably make out everything at once. We were fucking right in front of him, and I could see exactly where he was looking. His face had turned sideways, and my gaze met his as I looked down at him, seeing that he couldn't take his eyes off his cock getting hard. I looked back at the mirror and saw what Peter was staring at, looking at my pussy with his fingers inside of me. I was afraid that I would be embarrassed, or ashamed, or maybe even embarrassed myself, but I couldn't bring myself to bring my pussy and ass to his gaze.</p> <p>"I'm ready," I said, and pulled away from him, sitting down on the bench with my arms on the seat, spread wide apart, and looking at him.</p> <p>"Okay . . . what are you waiting for? Come on, let's do it."</p> <p>Peter wasn't as gentle as he could be, but he seemed to respond exactly what I wanted. He lifted my skirt and slid his hand down my thighs to my cunt, holding my panties in place when he came back up, sliding them over my swollen lips, and making them disappear again in the wet spot that grew there.</p> <p>"Yeah, I got these after we did you before," I said, pointing to a black lacy thong I had in my drawer, and he'd thrown in my bedside table. "You need to wear those too, for now."</p> <p>Peter laughed. "I'm up for anything, right now, and anything you want to do."</p> <p>I leaned over and kissed his chin after unbuttoning his shirt, and pulling down his zip. I felt his cock swell inside as I unzipped him, and he slipped out and stood up, lifting me into his arms and dropping me down on the bench just as Peter was sliding his cock up my wet pussy. I had a momentary pause, as I couldn't wrap my mindâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
