I say. "She is just the prettiest girl in the world...</p> <p>"She is..." I add. "But I also have a few girls in my world...</p> <p>"Yes, you do...you will do... you will."</p> <p>She sits up, her face is flushed red and her eyes are misty. She starts to sob again, "Look at me. I had hoped you wouldn't feel that way...and that I can tell you right now that I am completely faithful..."</p> <p>I look into her eyes. "Are you sure there is nothing wrong? Because I know I want a relationship as close to this as possible...</p> <p>"I mean it." I tell her firmly this time. "We both know that's wrong...and there isn't anything we can do to resolve it.</p> <p>"But...it's not your fault if you feel that way...it's yours...</p> <p>"Now if you could just go home...and come back..." I said with a smile on my face, "...because you are right about this...I would feel a great deal better."</p> <p>She stands up and starts to walk away. "Now go..." I say. "We'll talk later...</p> <p>"Bye.." she says and walks slowly, making her way to the door.</p> <p>I stare at her ass as she walks...</p> <p>I don't want her to see my face... I just want her to leave...</p> <p>And then I'm sitting there alone and in love. I can't tell you what is wrong with me... I don't even know what to feel about it. I just want some peace and happiness...</p> <p>And then I'm sitting there...</p> <p>It had just been a misunderstanding and I don't know what you feel...</p> <p>I can't take that feeling...I just can't...</p> <p>* * * * * * * * *</p> <p>"You are truly a treasure, John...I just hope we can all have a long time together...I hope you will be happy."</p> <p>I smiled and nodded at the words she said...</p> <p>"I think you have to go again...we have a lot to talk about."</p> <p>She looked at her watch, "You are the best gift I could ever have received..."</p> <p>"I know..." I told her with a smile this time, "It's still early...</p> <p>"I will see you next month then...maybe we can continue this."</p> <p>Her lips were still trembling, she leaned in for another kiss.</p> <p>I knew that I could never thank her for the happiness she is carrying with me...but in the end I did, and I can't go back to feeling alone after this dayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
