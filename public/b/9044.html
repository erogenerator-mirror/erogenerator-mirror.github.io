They had an open discussion and the two had a strong, warm, albeit rather small amount of intimacy as they looked at each other. After what seemed like many minutes, Mike broke the silence.</p> <p>"So are you going to leave us again, at least tomorrow? You said you had a thing for me."</p> <p>Kelsey nodded enthusiastically.</p> <p>"You're right; we definitely should get together one more time. Why don't we get together again tomorrow afternoon and do it without the kids home yet?"</p> <p>"OK...but can we stop?"</p> <p>Mike shrugged. The other woman seemed to be looking at him intently.</p> <p>"You know it!" she said, suddenly getting up and running to her bedroom.</p> <p>Mike followed her. They looked at each other in surprise. Mike just shrugged again.</p> <p>It really was getting late yet...</p> <p>+++</p> <p>As Mike finished cleaning up after himself, he looked at his phone on his nightstand.</p> <p>"Holy shit! Oh my God!"</p> <p>"Holy shit! Holy shit! Holy shit! Holy god!"</p> <p>It was just before 11:00 and I had just come home from work. I had a headache that seemed to come and just didn't seem to go away. I didn't even feel like going to sleep. My dreams never seemed to be a nice idea. I think they were better, actually. But I didn't really feel like going in to the bathroom to try again. Instead, I took a long, hot shower and went straight to bed.</p> <p>+++</p> <p>Kelsey and I stayed for a while. Mike was probably right about the kids being home. It was like I had just been on the receiving end of a nuclear bomb. I was really horny. When I woke up, the kids were gone. I got up off the bed and left the little kids to their own thoughts when I took off my panties. I'd slept through most of the night without any real sexual release, which wasn't surprising considering all that physical activity. I didn't really feel like a lot of work to get myself off.</p> <p>After getting ready to go into work, I dressed and headed downstairs to the kitchen. For some reason, I was surprised when Mike came over and kissed me on the cheek.</p> <p>"That was nice."</p> <p>"What are you smiling about?"</p> <p>"Your hair, you're so beautiful. I feel like you kissed me last night, but not your cheek this time. It feels like it was an accident. That really was nice."</p> <p>"You're right, you know. It was nice. But I wanted this to go from what I thought it was. I wasn't really expecting to get home tonight or tomorrow night."</p> <p>"You didn't expect to get home tonight?" I asked incredulously.</p> <p>Mike smiled again. "Yeah, I thought you're ready to have some fun."</p> <p>"Ok, you're just jealous," I said defensively. "Seriously, I guess I got a little carried away. I'm glad we talked."</p> <p>"I am too honey. We'd much rather have you all to ourselves," Mike said, kissing my cheek again.</p> <p>"I guess I didn't really expect things tonight," I admitted. "What about tomorrow?"</p> <p>"I could drive you home tomorrow if you'd like," he offered.</p> <p>"I'm OK with going to work," I said. "And there's going to be an excuse at the weekend to not have sex with you or anything else."</p> <p>"That sounds kind of fun to me. I have to admit, you're going to have a great time. And, I can't wait until Friday. I really want to be able to get back to sleep when I get out of bed and spend some more money with your parents."</p> <p>"That could just be a good sign that you're still horny and still in control of your energy and won't go down. There's no way you're going to go home tomorrow without doing something. Plus, I'd really like to have some alone time with you as our next of kin or whatever. How about it?"</p> <p>After thinking about it for a couple of minutes, I agreed to go to work that Friday night. I made sure to keep the kids in the playpen as much as possible, so I'd have plenty of privacy. Plus, I knew that I'd be able to get out of the house late in the evening at my work late.</p> <p>As soon as I got back to home, I decided to get another glass of whiskey just in case I got any ideas for dinner or anything.
