He could tell she was a pretty and sexy girl. He knew she was single. He decided to meet her on Saturday.</p> <p>#</p> <p>He was really hoping tonight wasn't a one-night stand. He wanted her. The only problem with that is that he was single, and he wanted her. He knew that had just taken another huge step. Maybe they wouldn't go any further.</p> <p>He had just gotten off lunch, and was just finishing the second glass of wine he had. He thought about getting a room at the bar, and ordering a coke. He was just about to pick up a bottle when he heard him call out from the shower:</p> <p>#</p> <p>She came home about 15 minutes later. She looked amazing. Her hair was up, and she had changed into a nightshirt that was white. She looked kind of wild. She was still dressed, and he was feeling like part of the action. She smiled at him as she walked in the door, and she took the glass from his hand.</p> <p>#</p> <p>"You didn't have to go to the liquor store. I just have some margarita teas."</p> <p>#</p> <p>He was glad for the beer. He didn't much care, but he did need one. He downed the first one in a full gulp, and took a second drink. He smiled at her as she took a seat at the table. He noticed that she smiled back. She had already gotten up and was heading upstairs. She returned a moment later, with two beers, and set a tray on the table with a drink. She set her tray next to her, and she took a sip of the drink before turning to him. She leaned in and kissed him, and he responded with a little kiss, and the tip of her tongue pressed against his lips. She broke off the kiss after a few moments, but he responded and they kept kissing. Then she leaned into him and they started kissing again.</p> <p>He didn't know how long the kiss lasted, but eventually she broke out with him. She took her beer from his hands. They kissed and talked a little bit more, and they kept rubbing and feeling each other's bodies.</p> <p>#</p> <p>When she was finally done, she looked at him and smiled. He could tell she was pleased with herself. She was probably very horny as well. She kissed him again, and then put on the rest of her clothes. He sat there, completely enthralled. He had been feeling horny for a long time. Finally he realized it was time to go. She grabbed his hand, and he followed her into the bedroom. They embraced again before she got on the bed in a nightshirt and pulled him on top of her. The bed was very soft. The room felt amazing. She pulled him to her, and kissed him. He didn't have time to respond as she was already naked, and he was already laying on top of her. He felt her naked body pressed against him. She was already so wet.</p> <p>He felt himself getting aroused again as they kissed passionately. She broke off the kiss, and began to kiss his neck and chest, his shoulders, and his arms. She found his nipples, and she began to nibble and suck on them. He couldn't take anymore. He pulled himself from her arms as she got on her back, and slowly moved down lower. He saw how excited she was becoming, and he knew he could take care of her that way. He slid back down her body as she opened her legs, and he knelt between them. She had already shaved herself so that she wouldn't leave a hair covering anything. She was really excited, and he wanted to make her cum so bad.</p> <p>He kissed his way down her belly and down her thighs. He continued there, but when he got to her pussy he paused to kiss it before licking her. He looked at how wet she was, and he knew she was ready for his tongue. She opened her legs wide, and he reached up to wrap one hand around her, and the other to feel her ass. She was also soaking so that he could barely touch her lips.</p> <p>He moved into position and he slid in easily. He slid all the way in, and felt her tighten around him. He felt her wetness on the backs of his thighs as he pushed himself forward. He felt her arms wrap itself around him as she tried to take some control. It didn't take long before he was thrusting in and out rhythmically. He felt her legs wrap tighter around him, and she pressed down against him to meet him every time he went in. He startedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
