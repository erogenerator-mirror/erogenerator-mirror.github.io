You don't have to be the judge for this. If he's a good kid, I'll leave. He wouldn't do anything that he saw or heard about." His eyes looked around the room curiously, looking for the others. "It's not good to get involved with kids on their first date if something isn't going well."</p> <p>The man turned away from the young boy but continued with the same story. "I have a daughter and a brother. They all got married to whomever they were. But they're all going to college to be with children soon. That is what the courts are like. They just don't allow it. In other words, people, not everybody, are looking to live their lives on the same path. No one is giving it up because they don't want to be the only one out of the country. They're just going to be out of the country for a little while."</p> <p>The man shrugged. "But I've been doing everything right and I don't think that I could trust him and not trust the other people to be right for me and their kids. So, you know I'm not asking you to do that, right? And I would not give up that for you just because I had to. But I might even give it up with you for something and I'll be with you and your family. You can't tell anyone about this," he said smiling and then he took a puff on his smoke and lit another before tossing a wad of tobacco back into the ashtray. "Besides, I've got a feeling about it that it won't take you long to get a second chance. It'll be good practice."</p> <p>"You sure you want to hear this, huh?"</p> <p>"Yeah," the man said with a nod, but it didn't leave anything for the younger boy. "But it won't be as long as I'd like. I've got a good idea where it'll lead." He sighed. "You might not like this, but I've got a better idea. I'm going to see what the hell he has to say about me. Is there any other way I can do this for you?"</p> <p>"He's not going to believe me if I tell him," the boy insisted in a calm voice. "I'll give him what he wants."</p> <p>"What I have is too small," the young man explained carefully. "I won't do it without him. At least not without you there. And if you're not going to stop, just tell him that you want it."</p> <p>"That depends," the young man said as he looked at the older man. "If I do it, I don't want the whole summer to be like this."</p> <p>"What a pity for your parents," the older man said bitterly. "Just for getting back into the game. I guess it's alright. I'm not going to lose my chance to score a kid like you." The man shrugged. "You'll make it and that's that."</p> <p>A sigh was in the young man's words, but the youth was quiet for a moment. "But what could happen if he had a few years on you," he whispered.</p> <p>"Probably not anything like that, but maybe you could give his mind back to them," the older man suggested sympathetically.</p> <p>"I think that's a good idea," the man said and then he turned to walk away. "If he's going to be anything like you are, it should make a difference. I don't think he'll ever be like you or anything else, but then he won't know about this. I'll still love that kid." He smiled softly and walked away.</p> <p>The younger boy stared at the man with a perplexing expression. "But I've done it before!" he screamed with a shake of his head. "I'm eighteen now. Who am I to judge him and make judgments about his behavior!"</p> <p>But the younger boy still had to shake his head and try not to look in the direction of his grandmother. She might not approve of all the people in their lives and it had nothing to do with what he had to do.</p> <p>"Don't you think it's better not to judge someone?" her older daughter asked softly. "He can make his own decisions." And then she burst out laughing.</p> <p>"Why? He's no better than anyone else!" she laughed. She reached across the little girl and lifted her head and kissed her cheek gently. "I still care for you," she told her without raising his head. "But you're better than him. And it's a pity he could go with anyone else." And then she was back in the small house of hers with her daughter, who still held a smileâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
