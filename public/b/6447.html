I heard her voice softly say to her, "don't worry darling, you can stay a little while longer. We'd love it if you'd stay longer."</p> <p>This wasn't how I wanted to end the night. I turned around towards her while turning round my face towards her and her voice came from the shadows of the balcony.</p> <p>"I think my friends will be back soon, but you can sleep on the couch if you like. I'll bring some wine and you could still take me to bed after all this," she grinned and turned away from me, walking to their bedroom. I watched her ass the whole way. Michelle had an athletic build, but it had all the effect of enhancing her round, tight body. She looked good in that tight fitting outfit, but I was sure I'd never felt anything so good. I turned back to watch her get out of bed and headed for the hallway.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>I took a long look at myself in the mirror before walking across the balcony to my living room. Michelle gave me an approving smile towards the bed. I sat on the edge and she joined me a short time later.</p> <p>"So how did it go with the new girl in the class, huh?" she asked. I didn't know how to answer, it was all too obvious that Michelle would want to know all about me. I guess I just assumed that when she saw me she'd give me a little smile, and I'd want to ask her about it so I could find out what it meant. I didn't have an answer to give her, the realisation of the whole situation hit me.</p> <p>"It was good," I answered honestly, hoping that what she'd said was true, it certainly was. "I think it was the best class we've ever finished. It was pretty neat. The classes are quite similar here though, you have to have the same attitude toward your students as they do throughout the campus. I'm sure they'll be proud that you've done so well."</p> <p>She chuckled, "I'm sure they will, even if you're not so happy about it," Michelle said before she fell completely silent again.</p> <p>The silence settled into the middle of the room as I tried to work it back into myself. "What is she anyway?" I wanted to ask myself. My eyes met hers as I waited for her answer.</p> <p>"She's my age," I found out already, Michelle was only twenty-seven.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I wasn't aware that," I whispered before I looked down at the table. I was suddenly aware that I'd dropped the food, not just my wine, but that I had been drinking much too much. "I think it's time I left now, I need to get home and take a shower," Michelle said softly before she turned to go up the stairs.</p> <p>"She must be really cute then," I heard her say as she reached the landing. I turned back and watched as Michelle disappeared into the bathroom. Just for a moment, I stopped as I watched Michelle walk back into the kitchen, all the way to the fridge where she stopped and picked up my glass.</p> <p>"So your friends are back then huh, and I think you had quite a row about me doing the shower?" she said in reference to her words. I nodded and started to say something, but her eyes quickly closed and she held out one finger. With a mischievous smile she beckoned for me to come and sit down at the kitchen table.</p> <p>"You'll just have to be more careful about what you speak about," she said to me. I thought about it for a moment, and was convinced that she was joking. "We'll make sure that you're properly trained, and I won't be so surprised if you're really good about it. Come on, you'll be good when they get here."</p> <p>The thought of finally having her pussy again was intoxicating to the point of being nauseated, like you were now. My eyes were closed the whole time she told me what her plan was for me and I had to wonder what she was doing to me by the way she was speaking to me as if she didn't know that she had the right to do any of this. "It's been great so far, but I'm having more trouble remembering that," I sighed to myself.</p> <p>I started to explain the whole scenario to her as Michelle sat beside me to talk to me. I wanted to explain to her the fact that I had never been with a girl before and even though I had been curious about it myself, she only showed me something that only she would say to me.
