Once he'd gotten out of the car and opened the passenger door, he leaned over and kissed her as she leaned over the hood of the car. He could feel the hard-on he'd had all night growing inside him and felt a strange tingling in his scrotum as her hot little nipples brushed against his chest.</p> <p>She broke the kiss and said, "Oh, God, I feel so dirty. Did you have that in mind for me this evening?"</p> <p>He responded in kind. "No, I didn't think it would be a good idea."</p> <p>"Well, I have a present for you!"</p> <p>He smiled and handed her his present.</p> <p>With a smile, Shelby said, "Yes? What's this?"</p> <p>He pulled out the present and opened it to find inside was a black leather corset.</p> <p>"Oh my God! That's so nice! I can't wait to see how you look in it!"</p> <p>With a wicked twinkle in her eye, Shelby continued, "So I can get a lot of that! Oh, and I've got a couple more in my bag as well."</p> <p>He smiled and said, "Then I think that a special treat is in order."</p> <p>She laughed and said, "You're so funny!"</p> <p>They got in the car and started to go down the highway.</p> <p>She said, "It feels so warm." Just then, he had to grab the wheel to prevent from making a big buckles sound... which he managed to get out of the car.</p> <p>"Hmmm. Does that feel cold?" Shelby asked him.</p> <p>"Yeah. Very."</p> <p>She said, "Just a bit... that doesn't really feel good, but let me try it!"</p> <p>They went into a quiet part of town, where the air conditioner was off and the wind outside cooled the air. Shelby said, "It's warm inside. I can feel it through my panties. I'm really starting to get turned on..."</p> <p>"That's fine. I've always felt the same way about you. In fact, we're going to have some really hot sex tonight. You just keep the car warm and I'll just turn this a little red."</p> <p>"A little red? You know, where do you want to put this next?"</p> <p>"There's a little hidden corner behind me, on the left side."</p> <p>"Uh," he said, "there's a little bit of a wet patch on the seat."</p> <p>She smiled and said, "You have no idea, baby!"</p> <p>Before they were out of town, Shelby wanted to get home. "This is getting a little cold." she said as they came up.</p> <p>"Why don't you put on a sweater?"</p> <p>She laughed and said, "My tits would be all warm too."</p> <p>They drove in silence for a bit, until they approached a large, wrought iron gate leading to a large parking lot. "It's dark out here, but if you're quiet enough I'll help you out."</p> <p>"Really?" he said.</p> <p>"Really!"</p> <p>He drove her through the gate, and she was amazed at how many doors a car could possibly fit. A light came on around the corner leading into the lot. As they approached, Shelby noticed no lights or anything. A little voice inside her head said no lights.</p> <p>"You've got a nice dress, don't you?"</p> <p>"I... I... just bought it just for you..." she stammered.</p> <p>"It's the same one I'm wearing now!"</p> <p>"Yeah... that's nice."</p> <p>She had no other choice. She pulled down her dress, and he held it while she looked in the mirror. "It's a really pretty dress. Do you like it?"</p> <p>"Yeah, it looks great on you... nice, but not sexy."</p> <p>"Mmm hmm. Do you like it?"</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>"Hmm."</p> <p>She had never felt so alone. This was a perfect moment, for him.</p> <p>He gave her a kiss on the lips. "It's perfect! You look so amazing, Shelby. Thank you again!"</p> <p>She gave him a hug and a warm smile. "Thanks. You're not too bad yourself!" he said as he drove away.</p> <p>She pulled the dress back up after they'd parked and then ran up the driveway to where he stood as they approached. She gave him a kiss on the lips. "I'm still horny!"</p> <p>"I don't thinkâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
