I... want you!"</p> <p>"I know. I'm the same way," she gasped. "I always tell you everything. I'm tired of telling you that."</p> <p>"Yeah, me too. I have never felt something that... that intense. I want to be with you for a long," he admitted.</p> <p>She was quiet for a moment. "I like you, too."</p> <p>"Well, you're very special to me," he said.</p> <p>"What?" She asked, shocked.</p> <p>"My friend Sam," he said, his voice quivering a little.</p> <p>"No, I mean Sam? He does that," she said, not wanting to seem too eager.</p> <p>"He has a lot of friends, though. Friends and family," he chuckled. "But I always get upset when he seems to be the one having an affair on me. It makes me crazy."</p> <p>"I always feel like his wife is cheating," she said.</p> <p>"She does," he agreed. "I know it was stupid of me to keep finding out. That, and it's been pretty great. But I know she loves me and respects me deeply."</p> <p>"We're friends already," she laughed. "I mean, I've known her for as long as I can remember."</p> <p>"She still does some things in and out of love, sometimes. At school, the sex is a thing of the past. It's hard and sometimes you get mad. Like the time she got pissed off at you and you said something to her and I just had to walk away. Like you were mad when you told me."</p> <p>"I don't know about that... you never said anything to her," she said.</p> <p>"She did. Not to me. Or to my daughter. Or my daughter's mother. I'm a different type of man. I never meant to hurt her... and she has never seen it either. The feelings you two have for each other are something new," Dan said. "Sometimes, when you're together, you realize things in each other. If things didn't work out, it's hard to be friends anymore. I guess a lot of the things we've been talking about, it's all new to me. Even the way we are, I feel like there's something wrong with us. I'm not sure what that is, but I believe that it's something bad.</p> <p>"You don't trust me," she said. "What does that have to do with anything?"</p> <p>He considered her for a moment. "No, that's not right. All of that..."</p> <p>"I know it's wrong," she said. "What I'm not even sure that I even know. I have to trust someone that I don't know about, like you. I know I love Sam, and I believe I can love him. Whatever happens, whatever I do, whatever you do, I don't want to keep it from you. Just be comfortable with that. I have to trust that it's going to happen."</p> <p>"I guess we just need to take things really slow with Sam," he said. "It can't hurt to wait."</p> <p>"Maybe not, then," she giggled. "And you don't know what it would have been like if you weren't with him forever."</p> <p>Dan's eyes widened. "It's not that easy," he said.</p> <p>"I know, I know. It's just hard to know about it."</p> <p>"But we can't do something that..."</p> <p>"What?" She interrupted him. "We couldn't."</p> <p>"No, I guess not. But... we can't be honest with each other anymore. We just don't have the time. And then, all of a sudden, it's like, you know?"</p> <p>"That's not right, you know? You need time. You need to make sure things are working out," she added.</p> <p>"I don't want to. I just want to be good for both of you."</p> <p>"Right," she nodded. "I understand. And then some time you need to think things through too. But... I need you to be on that road to healing. I'm not just going to get hurt. I get... well, you know. I don't know what I'm going to tell you. I don't know how to tell you anything..."</p> <p>Dan chuckled. "You can still worry about that when it comes, no matter what it might be."</p> <p>She nodded. "I know."</p> <p>"You like to be loved."</p> <p>She laughed and blushed. "I guess I don't really mean that," she saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
