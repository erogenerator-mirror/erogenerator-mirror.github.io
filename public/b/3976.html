It just wasn't enough. I couldn't get enough of taking you.</p> <p>"It's not because I'd never tried anything," I answered truthfully.</p> <p>"You'll be even better in my mouth and pussy. You're better in my ass," she said and went back to licking my cock and balls.</p> <p>The pleasure in her tongue licking was starting to get more intense and my hand drifted to her ass. I gently pushed one finger in. She didn't mind. She lifted her hips as if she was trying to get some penetration. At first she moaned but soon she was making soft slurping sounds. She started to slide her tongue in and out in time with her finger. With her other hand she was starting to rub my balls. I was aching to be inside her.</p> <p>I pulled my cock out of her throat. It was time to start a real fucking. I pulled her up to me and slid my dick into her. I was surprised that she was really wet.</p> <p>I pulled her back to my hardon and went to town on her body. I was surprised at how hard she was and the speed with which she came. I took her breasts into my hands and she moaned.</p> <p>In the moment I wanted to fuck her again, and for once, I was going to give it to her. I pushed her away, reached around to her pussy with my tongue. She started to moan again and I stuck my fingers, still wet with her juices, into her anus.</p> <p>"Oh, God," she cried as she came yet again.</p> <p>I put my finger back in her pussy. She didn't protest as my finger slid easily in.</p> <p>"Yes, that's what I want," she urged as I continued to finger fuck and lick her.</p> <p>I took my dick and was going to fuck her hard and give her pussy a full-body pounding. I pulled out of her pussy, leaving her hot ass with juices. I pulled her back to me. I felt the wetness on my dick and started to rub. As her body was so close to mine and I could reach closer to her, I slowly rubbed myself from the bottom of my dick up slowly. It was an intense feeling and I thought I was going to get an orgasm very soon.</p> <p>And I was right. She came again. And again. It was as if her orgasms had a lot to do with a whole wave of pleasure.</p> <p>I felt the last of my climax building deep in my dick. I held her hip again and pressed my hand against her clit. Her body became rigid and I felt the cum in me build. I squeezed her breasts with my hands.</p> <p>"Do it now," I said.</p> <p>"Do it," she screamed.</p> <p>And I did. I pulled her back to me, thrusting my dick into her with everything I had. Her tits were wet with sweat and I could feel her pussy juices sliding down her thigh and my balls slapping against the underside of my cock.</p> <p>As the intense orgasm overwhelmed me she came again. This time it was really strong.</p> <p>She was biting my shoulder when she was finished and I was really glad I had let go of her hips. I had gotten my wish so far from the beginning. And after a long sigh I pulled her back to me.</p> <p>"I loved being you," she said.</p> <p>"And I loved fucking a woman, too," I added.</p> <p>"Was anyone disappointed when I came?" she asked.</p> <p>"The first couple of times was spectacular," I said.</p> <p>"That's wonderful," she said, kissing me.</p> <p>The rest of the night we were together like that. Her body was soft and she made me feel so feminine. Every time I thought about fucking her I became harder. Every time I thought about her I felt dizzy with excitement, so I just told myself not to think about it.</p> <p>That was a month later and a full month of lovemaking with her would happen many more times.</p> <p>Chapter 12</p> <p>"I love it when you fuck me," I told my beautiful wife.</p> <p>"I love it when you're so hot and wet," she said as she rolled over in the bed next to me.</p> <p>It wasn't the first time we had fooled around since our last date.</p> <p>"I'm ready. I wanna fuck," I said.</p> <p>"Are you?" she asked.</p> <p>"I want to eat you," I responded.</p> <p>"I want to go slow," she said, rubbing between pussy and ass.</p> <p>As Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
