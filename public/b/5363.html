He reached down and pushed my panties to one side of my legs. I could hear him breathing harder and deeper. He was so aroused, so fucking aroused! He started with his fingers again and pushed into me. He pushed up on his own and then moved to my hips, holding them against his cock, moving in and out. He rubbed his finger on my clit, stroking it, getting close to bringing me to that height.</p> <p>I could feel him moving in me, his cock rubbing my clit, it was the most erotic sensation I have ever felt. Oh my god that sensation.</p> <p>It was so good, my eyes were wide opened and I could feel the heat in my legs, my clit was throbbing and wanting more and more.</p> <p>The tension and lust was rising inside me, rising toward it's inevitable conclusion. "God, I'm ready," I said and he didn't answer.</p> <p>He pushed me to the side and stood up, holding his cock in one hand, pressing on it to my pussy. It slipped into the tightness of my flesh, it was heaven. He pushed it all the way into me, his hips still at mine and he held himself inside me; his fullness was filling me and stretching me.</p> <p>"Don't stop!" I said. "Please, keep going." He pulled my legs back and slipped out, thrusting down into me, pushing into me again and again, feeling my muscles tighten under his weight.</p> <p>My pussy stretched around the hot hard throbbing cock, I felt it's pressure and it almost hurt as it entered my channel again; the burning and burning, wanting to be filled again. It didn't and he didn't stop. He pulled it out again and again and again, my muscles gripping him with every motion he made. He started to withdraw and push back on my hips, pulling out completely again. Again and again and again, slowly and deeply, pushing in, pulling out, pushing in. He was in my body, his body was moving against me, pulling my body toward him, and I felt him inside me and loving me so completely; I wanted to cum with him and he wanted to, too. My body was alive with the hot friction of his cock, my wet muscles gripping him, pulling up, pulling down.</p> <p>He was in me, fucking and loving me, making love to me, his words not words, just hot erotic words. He told me how wonderful it was to be made love to that way, how the pleasure was to be felt at that moment, the pressure of his cock inside me and my body pressing up against his, his weight on me and feeling his cock sliding in and out of me. God, it was heavenly to feel him filling my body, his hardness, the need to fill me inside. I felt his hands pull my legs back higher and his thrusting down into me. His weight was on me now, his chest on my stomach, his hands around my shoulders, lifting me high and holding me. I wanted to move, want him to thrust deeper against me, but I could only feel his cock and his weight on me. I was on the brink and felt my body rising to meet his. I felt I was about to push up into him. I felt the cum boiling in my balls aching and begging for release. I wanted to be his, to be his woman, his lover, his slut. I pulled up on his hips and he lifted me off the edge again. I felt his cock deep inside me, as if it did nothing else than fill me up and move around. He fucked me, fucking me, hard and deep, thrusting his hips, driving his cock into me. It was driving me, it fucking drove me. I loved it when he would push me down into the bed, just as he would on the couch. I loved it when he would lift me up and drive his cock straight up into me.</p> <p>It drove him on to fuck me hard, fast, deeper, deeper. He fucked me in and out, thrusting deep into me, pulling out until my butt was against his pelvis, and then in again, his cock moving in and out and over me. I loved it when he would be deep, his cock rubbing my pussy lips and then in on my clit as he slammed into me and I loved it when he would take a hand and rub my lips, then slip between them and press his finger into my pussy so I could feel where they were joined and where their bodies were joined and where their mouths were kissed. I loved it when he would suck my lips between his and push his tongue in and suck against them and my tongue would be sucking a tongue into the hot wet tunnel of his mouth and back suckingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
