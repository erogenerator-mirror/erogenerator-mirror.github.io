She pulled them to the ground and stepped out of them and the shorts, followed by her bikini underwear. She folded them in half, stuffed them into a sock, stood barefooted again, with her clothes bunched up around her. It was then that she realized the man in front of her was actually wearing some sort of high-heeled black boots and that the boots had to be at least two inches higher than those of her own feet. She turned her head to see something else more unusual and her jaw and brain and body dropped when she saw the face she remembered she had never seen before.</p> <p>She was wearing a red PVC bikini swim-suit in the same color as the one she wore at the pool yesterday. She had never worn something like that before, but she didn't care. The suit was tight on her, clinging to her body like a second skin. Her breasts were barely contained and her legs were bare, but they were not exposed, as all high-heeled boots clung to them in the cold morning wind.</p> <p>She thought she saw hair, at first, before she saw the face she remembered, but as time passed, she saw that it was a black wig, which she later learned was a wig, also held in place by leather straps and leather straps.</p> <p>The man holding the mask smiled warmly at her, pulled it up over his head and let the mask free drop onto his bare shoulders.

He placed both hands on her waist, and pulled her as he had her up so she was up, and it made her gasp.</p> <p>He pushed her head up towards his chest and she watched in horror as the thick black coat covered his body. Her eyes went down to how her nipples, now fully erect poked through the thin red fabric of the suit, and she wondered as she watched how large and firm his nipples looked in those suit-like boots. They were small and barely noticeable, just barely noticeable. She wondered if he didn't like big women and wondered how big a man he was and whether it seemed to make her body move with his.</p> <p>"So here we are," he said, as he helped her down, holding her face against his chest and pulling her hair back out from her face. He kissed her nose, her lips and her cheeks, and then she felt the coat lift off her, and the man she didn't know, in his arms was leading her from the room, her head swimming with questions.</p> <p>"The rest of you get back in your cars, I'll drive, and you go out," he said, pushing her away from the door. "And you will see my truck and drive out to the lake to meet my men."</p> <p>She turned and walked to the truck, not even thinking about the mask covering her eyes. She saw the man behind her and the van in the van, and she shuddered as she saw the man in the suit that she had just fucked, but that made no sense in her current state. "Oh," she thought.
