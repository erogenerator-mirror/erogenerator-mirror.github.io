Now you know what I mean."</p> <p>"What's that?"</p> <p>"Suck me dry," she whispered. "And you can do it."</p> <p>I didn't have a choice. My hard cock had been trapped beneath my waistband, and the wetness was almost unbearable. There wasn't much room to move, but I managed to find a position beneath the waistband between us. I felt her tongue on the underside of the head of my cock, and I could hear her swallowing it, licking the clear liquid out of me, making me tingle with anticipation. Then she was licking me again, and after her teasing I was getting close to being ready to blow when she stopped.</p> <p>"There's a condom in the other drawer, dear," she said.</p> <p>She was still on her back, propped up in the middle, waiting for me to get to that part. I couldn't have done without it. I had a condom in my pocket, and a few of the others in my shirt pocket...maybe I should have rolled it on and slipped it on myself.</p> <p>I pushed her legs open again, then found a spot of skin that I liked.</p> <p>She put the tip of my cock against it slowly, and I felt her mouth on the tip. She started moving her ass up and down so my cock went in and out, making little sounds of ecstasy that only she could tell. Then she was moving herself up and down, her whole body rocking and quivering as she worked herself over.</p> <p>I started going back into her, going deeper into her now, trying to fit more and more into her.</p> <p>"Now, fuck me now," she said, and grabbed my head, pressing my lips hard to hers.</p> <p>I pushed into her hard. Then she was going up and down, up and down, her whole body shaking as I pushed into her, deeper and deeper. I was so excited, my legs were shaking just like her. She was making me come, and I couldn't even stop.</p> <p>"No," I said, but she only moaned in response.</p> <p>"We're doing it, aren't we?"</p> <p>"We're going to fuck," she said as I pulled back, and then sank back into her wet pussy.</p> <p>"But I like it."</p> <p>"Like what, silly?"</p> <p>"Like you fucking my pussy."</p> <p>I put my hands on her hips as she started to move slowly, her whole body moving just as I had. We were fucking like mad animals now, and I found it hard to concentrate, though still having a cock in my hand all the time. I pulled harder on her hips, pushing with more force as she started to moan even louder, and then I felt my whole body start to spasm, and I felt her body stiffen.</p> <p>*It seemed to last for moments, but it was probably only a few seconds. Only after we had come down and my cock finally softened did she get off of her back, her legs still spread wide to give me a good view of the whole sight of my cock sliding into her still-covered pussy.</p> <p>It felt like only seconds later that she pushed me back into the chair. I was just on my side and she sat on me, her big tits falling into my right palm, her big brown nipples pressing into my chest. She turned my face up to hers and kissed me slowly, lightly.</p> <p>"Now you know what I mean?" she whispered in my ear. "I still think about that night when we had a few drinks."</p> <p>"You were a bit excited," I said.</p> <p>"Mmm...that wasn't that big of an event or anything," she said, "but I'm still thinking about it. It was the first time I'd ever been with a woman."</p> <p>*Yeah, I still think of that...but I'm sure you don't want to go there now. We have so much more to tell you. I feel so guilty... but, there's more to it. We could have sex or just do it all the time." She sounded hurt.</p> <p>"That's what I thought," I smiled at her. It was a bit of a mistake to say that about her, but at the time it wasn't a big deal.</p> <p>She was smiling too, and she held me again. I felt a finger lightly touch my bottom lip.</p> <p>I didn't know what to say. She was right. I was sure that I was going to have fun talking this through if we could.</p> <p>"I've always wanted you to fuck me."</p> <p>"Of course," I said, knowing she was right.</p> <p>"But it's only going to be you," she said, and held me even tighter.</p> <p>*We were both moaning, the little sounds we madeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
