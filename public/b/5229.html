"What am I supposed to do? I could go home and leave everything in your dress!"</p> <p>"But the dress! Just take it off."</p> <p>He stared at her. She was standing by the door, leaning against it and holding it to her, her eyes still on the door. What choice did she have? He looked down at the dress. It was a plain black chiffon with a black ribbon around it. The front was slit up one side from just below her breasts to the top of her thigh and again to the top of her thigh. Around her hips and on the belt of the dress were cut off pants. They hugged her like panties, showing off her slim waist from below just behind the zipper. A string was dangling down one side so that her ass was uncovered. That was where it ended and the front plunged deep into the cleft of her pussy.</p> <p>"What?" He said.</p> <p>"I think, uh, we're going to have sex!"</p> <p>"You know, I'm not sure"</p> <p>"Come on!" she urged him. "I've got you covered!"</p> <p>"No way!" he replied. "I mean, come on! It'll be my own fault if you don't change it."</p> <p>"Don't be silly, you stupid ass!" she replied. "I'll go to the bathroom and change it anyway!"</p> <p>"Please" he said, "This dress's beautiful!"</p> <p>The black dress covered what you could see of her body up to her breasts but left the lower parts of her body exposed. The top went all the way up to mid-thigh where it stopped around her waist, a point where her skin broke away from under the lace to reveal her navel. The dress clung to her body like a second skin; it clung to her breasts, it clung to her waist, the whole length of her smooth, sexy body and it clung to her ass. She looked sexy in it.</p> <p>She looked at him as he put his hand on a breast. He was nervous.</p> <p>"You're married," she smiled. "And, um, you look like you..."</p> <p>"I'm not!" he said, trying to sound stern.</p> <p>"Oh, I thought you said, um, men weren't supposed to..."</p> <p>"I know what I said" he interrupted her. He was standing now, his hands on his hips, his hands behind his neck.</p> <p>She turned around and leaned up against the door, her face right at him. Her eyes looked up. Her face was just inches away and his mouth was level with her own. He looked at her, and then at the dress. He looked up at her and back at her face as they stared.</p> <p>"Come on" she said. "Take it off and come to me."</p> <p>"But..."</p> <p>"Come, come" she said. "Come and take it off. I want you to fuck me."</p> <p>"But, what about the dress?" he said.</p> <p>"No need to take it off" she said, "Come on" and stood up, her hips swaying in front of him as she pulled the dress off her shoulders. He got a long look at her back and the straps of her lingerie, where they were connected by a thin, black bow. Her bra was there, though, too. She turned back slowly, her hips swaying and her breasts swaying in time to herself as she slowly peeled the black lace off her shoulders. He looked down, saw her beautiful, white, bare breasts and saw that she wasn't wearing a bra, and he felt his cock jerk and twitch as she turned her back to him. He looked back down at the dress. Then back up at the sight of her body before his eyes. The thin, black panties hung off the edge of her ass, hugging the crack and crevice that it turned into. He felt his cock twitch once more at the sight.</p> <p>"Go, go, I don't care" she said, pushing the dress away as she turned back, her fingers running through the thin hair that framed her face and down her belly. She stepped out of the panties one at a time and stepped back. She looked down at herself. There was a large patch of black satin covering her pussy. With just a slight curve to her hips, she ran one finger through it to spread the crotch out and to pull it away from her skin. The panties were now off her body completely, and there hung a large, round breast on top of it. The nipple was hard and small. Her breasts were full and smooth and firm. The weight of both of them was perfect. She smiled down at himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
