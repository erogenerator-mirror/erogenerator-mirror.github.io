She began to shake, and I slowed my movements.</p> <p>"Slow down a second," I said.</p> <p>She stopped shaking, and slowly took a few deep breaths. "I'm nearly there," she breathed.</p> <p>I gave my index finger a few more long laps and she pulled it out with a "click" as if to wipe her cum down my leg.</p> <p>"I'm ready," she said.</p> <p>I took hold of her hips, and lifted her off me as gently as I could. "Where do you want me to shoot?"</p> <p>"What would you like me to do?" she asked with a shy tone. "Can you do anything for me?"</p> <p>In the past I wanted it to be slow, hard, and intense; to take me to the hilt. But this time I wanted to take the edge off the end result. And I wanted to see if she was all that I'd been able to take. I lifted her off, bent her over, and entered her from behind.</p> <p>I took my time, and enjoyed the feel of her firmness. It was like I was a stranger touching her all over again, and she was a stranger not even close to being touched, but it really felt nice. I pulled out and went right back in, a lot harder than I thought was possible. I started to really enjoy myself; feeling her up, and enjoying her reactions. I was also starting to get a little more playful.</p> <p>"Do you want to take a few selfies?" I asked her as I took several shots.</p> <p>"I'll take the ones from the top," she giggled.</p> <p>I went to full tilt, and we took shots in a single line, then we went through several more lines and some with different partners. Some of them ended up on the screen, all in various positions. The two of us continued to be connected to each other physically, and our minds and lives were so completely connected and completely in tune with each other.</p> <p>Eventually our line got long enough for the two of us to meet in a passionate kiss, necking one last time, our sweaty bodies pressed against each other. I pulled her up and turned her around to continue kissing her, and began to feel her breasts. She leaned up against the wall, and I took an opportunity to lean in and kiss her neck with every bit of contact I could. I took a step back and started to kiss her cheek and her neck, while I gently massaged her breasts.</p> <p>"I think you're overdressed," she grinned.</p> <p>"I'm not," I said. I had to. I was about to go crazy.</p> <p>She giggled; the sound was so sexy I couldn't help myself. I leaned up and removed the top I had been wearing just a bit earlier. She smiled. "It's so cute. And it makes you look so hot that I have to undo something."</p> <p>"Okay," I said, as I pulled her panties free of her body and tossed them to her.</p> <p>She smiled. "You're beautiful," she pouted.</p> <p>"No I don't know. I've just been so busy doing pretty much every other thing I needed to in the last two hours," she lamented.</p> <p>Her question was clear. All women I've been with in that time of passion and romance were always the same. They weren't just my friends. They were my lovers. I loved every woman I had ever been with. They were every woman I loved. And I loved every woman I was with. But it was getting difficult to look at any of them. I felt so vulnerable.</p> <p>I pushed her back and unclasped her top. Her breasts spilled free, and with a little wiggle I removed the rest of her clothing. Then I was ready to take my lovemaking to another level. Instead of just fucking her right away, I reached into her and took off her pants. This time when I got them past her hips, I began to fuck her as her body trembled. She was so sexy.</p> <p>I felt like the whole world was standing in front of me as I fucked her. It was like a whole world had been reduced to my brain, and I felt my world collapse around me as if I had been blown out of it. I was feeling as much love for this woman as any man, and she was my world.</p> <p>When I saw this beautiful girl being fucked I knew what the difference between fantasy and reality was. In reality, there was no limit to how long we could go. In fantasy, it would seem like a one-time thing, and I'd always feel jealous and possessâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
