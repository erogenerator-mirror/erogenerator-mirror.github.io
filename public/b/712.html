It's a normal human reaction when we become erect.</p> <p>"You want a piece of this?" I said.</p> <p>"Yes, I do," She said and bent over to hand it to me. I grabbed it but didn't touch her.</p> <p>We had talked about it a lot before. Now that it was happening, I was more in awe of the concept of doing this.</p> <p>She was wearing a simple pair of dark colored panties. They were plain and thin, but when she slid them over her legs she was completely bare.</p> <p>I stood, my erection standing proudly in front of me, feeling it throb just a little more.</p> <p>Her tits were large and they moved with her, swaying from side to side. They were perfect. They jiggled so fucking nicely. I wanted to touch them. I wanted to run my hands all over them. I just couldn't have those things moving all at once...</p> <p>"Let's go!" she said. She was out of the closet. "Come on, we really have to go... I'm not wearing clothes out here..."</p> <p>She was out the door. I walked over and she kissed me on the cheek like she always did every day and led me back to my car.</p> <p>"So this is what goes on in the movies and what happens between a girl and a guy?" She asked as she closed the front of my car.</p> <p>"I think you'll like it. I've got to tell the crew how you look in a bathing suit," I said. "It's about as skimpy as the front of a movie."</p> <p>"I'll have to try it on," she said and she slipped her fingers into the waistband of her panties. She started to pull them down, her panties fell to the ground. All I could do was watch her as she dropped her panties to her feet.</p> <p>She had nice long legs. She was a lot shorter than me - I guess 5'4" - and she was a lot heavier. She was also slightly heavier than I was.</p> <p>"I haven't worn these things in a long time!" she said softly. "You didn't make the same mistake I did."</p> <p>I looked at her, she really did want you to, but it'd be best if we took them off. With a quick nod from her I reached out my hand and helped her down. There was no way I could wait to see what it would look like up close. The whole thing was pretty neat and organized.</p> <p>She let out a soft sigh as I wrapped the underwear around my fingers with my other hand.</p> <p>"I'm not sure if I should really be wearing them," she said. "The guys would have to come to my house and they'd probably have to see everything."</p> <p>"You really should wear something nice," I said. "You look great in them."</p> <p>"But now I'm gonna have to go... so get in the front on the bike," she insisted and I started the bike. She hopped on and we headed back to our house.</p> <p>We got to the bedroom and started going through her clothes. She had on a new shirt that was much simpler, but it was a stretchy knit cotton dress, not too short. It wasn't as loose as her earlier top, but it showed more of her. She had on some sandals that came up to just above her ankles and she put on her hat and makeup.</p> <p>Then she had on the shirt, but it showed a lot of skin, not all.</p> <p>The dress was a fairly modest dress and I felt that I had to ask her to bring out the sex hat. It was probably a bit more conservative than the shorts she was wearing.</p> <p>"Here, you should have some sexy underwear too," I said and I ran my fingers between her breasts and under the fabric. She shivered at my touch.</p> <p>"And what's the catch?" she said.</p> <p>"You'll see," I said.</p> <p>I slipped the bra straps over her shoulders and then slid the bra straps down over her breasts. They were firm and with nipples that were as hard as diamonds. They were a perfect pink color.</p> <p>She watched, transfixed, while I took off the rest of her clothes and she stepped out of them. I helped her down off the bed and we got into the shower where she stepped in first. She turned around and looked at me and blushed.</p> <p>"Oh, my," she said, smiling. "This is so weird."</p> <p>"You're not weird," I assured her and took her by the hand and we walked out of the bathroom into the bedroom. I started taking off my clothes andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
