She asked, as she looked at his hard body again and again. Her voice was even, yet he got no reaction. He thought the whole thing would be a silly idea, but it was so fucking sexy; so hard to control. She leaned forward, kissing his neck and chest again.</p> <p>"Just go with it as it happens," Alex said. He pulled the dress up and she felt him rubbing and squeezing her ass again. He slid his hand up the back of her leg and under the dress, and started rubbing her asshole. She reached around with one hand, rubbing his hard cock. He slipped his finger into her wet cunt as she rubbed him through her dress. He rubbed and fingered her hard as she rubbed and rubbed her pussy. As he slipped his finger in and out of her pussy, he pushed it further, rubbing her erect clit. She was moaning and moaning now, grinding her pussy into his hand and ass, but Alex knew he could not stop her. He wanted to fuck her and fuck her until she screamed for mercy.</p> <p>He leaned down, biting her nipples, pulling on them while he fucked her pussy relentlessly. She was moaning, almost crying now, as he sucked and bit her breasts and rubbed harder and faster. He suddenly thrust his finger straight up her ass, and then held it there, holding back his orgasm until she begged him to stop, and then he eased his thumb over her clit, making her clench up again, moaning in frustration as he pulled his finger out and she started shaking all over again. Just when she was going to explode, his other finger left her cunt, and they both moaned in frustration as she did. Alex could not wait anymore and slid his finger back up her ass. She screamed in frustration and pleasure as he continued, now slipping his finger into her wet little pussy.</p> <p>"Do you want to fuck me," he asked?</p> <p>"Oh, fuck yes," she moaned. "I want you to fuck me. Fuck my pussy, oh fuck, finger my ass. Come on, baby. Make me cum. That's it, harder."</p> <p>He slipped his finger out again. He wanted to see her spreadeagled, bent over the chair while he fucked her ass with the other hand. His erection raged as she moved, now pulling and twisting his dick. Alex bent over the chair, her legs spread. Her ass stuck up. She reached back as he shoved his hard cock in her. He began a slow fuck, with her legs spread, letting his hard cock rub in all the sensitive parts of her ass. Her cunt juice continued to run down her ass as he held the base of his cock with one hand, and rubbed her clit with the other. She leaned forward.</p> <p>"Keep fucking me, baby. Keep fucking me. Make me cum," she moaned.</p> <p>Alex increased his speed, making her ass jerk up and down on his cock. He felt her ass cheeks clench against his cock, as he slipped in and out of her cunt. Her head rested on the chair as she pushed back into him, trying to get more of him deep inside of her. He could feel his hard shaft sliding in and out of her ass, as she pushed back into him with each thrust. Then she was coming, screaming all over the place. She wrapped her arms around his neck and laid her head on his shoulders. "Oh, god," she moaned weakly. "That was so good."</p> <p>"Did you like it," he smiled at her.</p> <p>"Yeah," she smiled at him, "that was so good."</p> <p>Alex laid his head on her shoulder and stroked her hair. She was the most perfect woman he had ever known. He was glad he was able to say that to her, and that she had the same feelings that he did. They had just come on a new chapter of their lives together. This might be the beginning of what could become a long and fulfilling friendshipâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
