She said laughing.</p> <p>"The pool is fine, I mean I would have to get used to a pool like this." I said still catching my breath.</p> <p>"I can go over to the house and change." She replied smiling at me.</p> <p>"No you can't, you should go for a walk." I said and with a smile she got up and started to get undressed. I just stood there looking at her nude body.</p> <p>"Hang on a sec." She said walking out to the back of the pool. She laid out her bikini and went back to stand by the pool. I got down to my bathing suit and went into the house to change.</p> <p>When I got back in my bedroom I went over to the TV hoping that I could still turn it off but nothing was on. I went over to my bed and turned the TV off. I looked at the clock, it was just before noon. I got up and picked out some clothes. I got back into my underwear and grabbed a clean tee shirt. I put it on and headed out to meet the girls.</p> <p>I went into the kitchen and grabbed a couple beers and got started to prepare them. I walked over to the pool to check the house out. As always it was perfect. The house felt like something you had been in the first time ever you stepped on it. You could tell that the place was full of life. There was a big lounger in the middle of the floor where a couple of tables and some chairs were. The pool gave me a good excuse not to get in much further.</p> <p>I headed over to where they were lounging and I decided that I would wait a little while. It was a little after one when the girls got dressed and started to head out. I took a beer and put up my tent pole and headed to the pool. I felt out of place in here, the pool was full of people. The girls were wearing their bathing suits but they were pretty well covered up.</p> <p>"What are you doing out here?" Kelly said as she started to strip slowly.</p> <p>"Getting a break from our normal day." I said not sure where I was.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" She asked</p> <p>"Making this a special day for Kaye." I said getting very embarrassed and wanting a towel.</p> <p>"Don't worry we are having the time of our lives here." Kelly said as she took her top off. This was the first time we had ever done this. I didn't mind. She came out of the pool. She had her hair back in a tight ponytail. She was wearing a white t-shirt that was really tight on her. All in all she looked great. I was really interested. I was now getting hard just by looking at her.</p> <p>"You want to come for a swim? It's a little hot here." Kaye said and walked towards me the rest of the way to the pool. I took her hand and let her step in. She looked so hot.</p> <p>"Do you plan on hanging out here all day?" She said looking at me.</p> <p>"Yeah, I'll call in sick." I said grabbing the blanket and headed for the water. I was trying to calm down. She took the blanket and threw it in the water and began to swim down the river towards me. Kaye was just pulling on her towel which I could just make out from her. We had just gotten in the pool when Kaye said "Come on."</p> <p>"I'll get you in, I have to work tomorrow morning." I got out of the water looking at her naked body. I got out of the pool and headed towards the kitchen. It was at least 30 minutes before I was back to the house on the patio. The girls were setting out on the loungers drinking beers and talking. Kaye had removed her shirt and now was wearing a pair of tight black jeans. I thought nothing of it and followed her. She had a bottle of vodka sitting on the table next to the lounger her jeans really tight. She had just put her glasses in the fridge when I walked in.</p> <p>"Are you going to join me?" Kaye said to me. She looked really hot. She had on a short dark black skirt that went almost to her foot. Her long blonde hair was pulled back in a pony tail. She had on a tight white t-shirt that was just barely covering her C cups. Her tits were pushing out her shirt and I could see the lace around the bottom of her nipples. Her nipples were sticking right out. I walked over to her and she leaned over to me and kissed. I kissed her back. I broke off the kiss.
