Take me home. I love you!</p> <p>I agreed, looking at the clock, knowing we would be going our separate ways soon, and that our friendship was all over. It would not be as much as you would have thought.</p> <p>* * O *</p> <p>I was so horny by the time we got to the hotel that night. My mind was working overtime as we entered the lift. My pussy felt sticky with desire and my nipples were on fire as we climbed the steps. The taxi driver made a strange sound as he approached me and I felt his hand running across my face, over my brow and down my neck as I felt his kiss on my breast. I reached out and held his hand firmly and he moved his face away as if to go to the toilet.</p> <p>'I'll get your bags in when we are alone.' I said. That was the only thing on my mind in the car ride.</p> <p>As the taxi made its way towards the hotel, I looked in the mirror to see if this was going to be an adventure. I was feeling so incredibly horny to feel his mouth all over my breasts, his fingertips gently stroking my nipples, and I knew I was close to falling apart with the anticipation. I had always wanted a man that could bring me off, but never had I been able to fulfil what I had just been about to do. I was totally amazed at the feelings on my body. Now I'd have to be even more surprised if it wasn't just his mouth on my breasts that was a turn-on. I had to tell myself that my body was on fire, and that I didn't want to wait another minute – not even a minute to wait to feel my husbands fingers inside me. My cunt throbbed with a longing as his hands reached up and caressed my breasts through my low-cut blouse and the fabric of my bra. I lifted one foot to allow him access to my crotch and he pushed my hand onto his crotch once again as I felt his rigid cock through his pants. His hand ran through my silky curls as he gently and almost agonisingly pinched a nipple and massaged the area through my bra, causing my cunt to gush and my juices to run over his fingers. I leaned back against the door of the taxi as I felt his fingers move down my stomach to tease and torment my soft curls.</p> <p>It was all I could do to keep myself from screaming out, as I heard him let his head fall back and close his eyes and I could feel his hand reaching between my legs and gently tugging at my panties as I could feel him sliding down to his knees and slowly and carefully removing my panties, letting them fall on to the floor at my feet as I stepped out of them. He lifted my legs over his shoulders and leaned forward, sliding my panties up my thighs to expose the wet, glistening lips of my pussy. As his tongue swirled in my pussy, his hands slowly stroked the outside of my thighs, feeling the soft leatheriness of my stockings, his fingers lightly running over the insides of my thighs. I felt my hands on the back of his head, feeling his hair tickle my thighs, and I knew what was happening when he started to work his tongue into my pussy, starting with the outer lips, and gradually sliding it up inside me. I tried to move his head up from where he had been in a couple of minutes before, but was met with some resistance as I looked out into the taxi and saw he was still facing the road. He was smiling at me and I knew he was enjoying the moment, and I felt the delicious tingling of power and excitement as I thought he would be looking at me, looking at me when he would touch my body.</p> <p>I could tell he had the same idea, so he slid upwards again and started to work his tongue into my pussy. I held his head in place as far as I could go as he explored my pussy, enjoying having a man so close to me. I could feel my juices running down his chin as he swirled and caressed my lips and clit with his tongue. I lifted my hips a little, trying to force my pussy to move in his eagerness. He stopped suddenly, pulling back only as he felt the silkiness of my stockings beneath his hot breath. I felt my breasts press against his chest as he pulled back, and then pushed back into me, feeling the hardness of his cock poking at my stomach as I moved my hips upwards. I felt his cock at the entrance to my pussy. It was so hard and hot against my stomach.</p> <p>'Put it in!' I whispered. 'Please,' I added. He was all too easy to please and I could tell he was also eager and impatient to feel his cock inside me.
