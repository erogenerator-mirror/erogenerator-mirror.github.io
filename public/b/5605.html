With one final kiss and a tug on his balls she settled herself on my cock. I could feel the warmth of her pussy enveloping my cock and pushing me towards climax as we joined. She reached between them to play with his balls while I pushed into her and she started to bounce up and down on my cock in time with my thrusts. We fucked wildly. Finally, I felt her cum again. As I watched the last spasm of her orgasm, she looked down at me and smiled.</p> <p>"I think we need to do something about that big cock of yours," she said. "You really know how to treat a girl."</p> <p>Sitting next to me was a gorgeous woman. Not only by size but by a great job of making me lose any sense of self. Her legs encased my waist and her breasts on my cheek. Her hair flowed down over mine. I could feel her softness against the head of my cock. Her hips moved ever so slightly trying to coax me to put more of me in her. Slowly but firmly she held me. As her body became accustomed to me she would slide her hips back and forth, each time her hips would move up on me.</p> <p>I could feel the juices from her pussy run through us. She closed her eyes, leaning forward and whispering in my ears. "I'm going to love having that big cock of yours in me all night long. You have no idea how I came to enjoy that."</p> <p>I was so turned on I didn't care what she thought. She'd make me cum. It was just going to take some time.</p> <p>Pulling off me, she leaned in again to kiss me, licking my sperm as she did. She reached down to take some into her mouth and started to suck me again. Then looking up at me, she smiled. "I'm going to take some time to make up my mind," she said.</p> <p>She stood up and grabbed one of the pillows and helped me lie down on the bed. She lay next to me and kissed me, moving from one ear to the other. "Do you have any idea how many times I've fantasized about being with you?" she asked.</p> <p>"Me? You're the only woman I've ever seen that I'm interested in." Was her response.</p> <p>"You're not a big cock lover. A very lucky guy. You're a lucky man," she said, smiling at me again with her eyes still closed.</p> <p>"You know, I was talking last night about your girlfriend. She's a wonderful one. She's a lucky number. If it came to my idea though, we would have probably done it at the same time."</p> <p>"That's just wrong," she said, then suddenly she pulled me into a deep, tongue kiss. "I love a mouth so full," she said, "I'd be a fool to think you don't have that same type of feelings right now." Her tongue had me hard again.</p> <p>Her fingers found my cock. With a tug it almost came out the top. When she got to the top I heard a noise like a bird in the night. There were three of us on the bed.</p> <p>"Honey! Can we do it? Can you?" she asked. All I could do was get out in between her lips. Her tongue was moving in circles around mine, like a cat. I was on fire. All my blood was pounding my ears. But, my cock was hard. I moved her from my lips. I looked in her eyes. She looked in my eyes and, they were open, she nodded. Slowly I pulled her down to me. As I did hers she kissed me with a lot more of a passion than I expected. I could feel her breasts against my chest. When our tongues met, I could feel the pressure of her breasts on my chest. She was breathing hard, so very very hard. She pulled me towards her so her breasts were pressing against my chest and her body was pressed tight against mine. Finally I broke the kiss, reached a hand down to her ass and pulled her hard against me.</p> <p>"Baby," I heard her say. "You can fuck me if you want to, but if you want to make it more than just sex you're going to have to do something." She kissed me again and whispered. "I'll call her."</p> <p>With that she stood and walked to the door. I stayed on the bed while she got away. When she returned she walked over and opened the door. "There he is," she said as she let herself out.</p> <p>After our conversation, we talked and ate and talked until closing time. She looked at me and smiled. "Well baby, I guess time is up," she said. "Well, I think we'll need to get readyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
