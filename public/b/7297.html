His lips moved to his temple, "What was she doing this time? What were you thinking about?"</p> <p>"Just thinking of you." A pause went on for a minute. He could feel his heart pounding in his chest. His palms were sweaty. He couldn't talk for two seconds. They lay still.</p> <p>"I'm sorry" he spoke quietly. "Look...I think we should head home." He spoke in the hopes that he could get his head back on track. He could see how she felt about him, her reaction. He knew she felt the same way about him. She wanted more from him. He started to get up.</p> <p>"Wait," he started. "I'm going to shower." His voice was a deep growl. "After that, we can do whatever you wanted to do."</p> <p>"Well..." she started. "Go ahead..." Her eyes stayed on his, "I'll take care of you."</p> <p>He closed his eyes. There was nothing else he could do. He couldn't stop himself from walking out. But his feet were aching. He wasn't used to being away from someone for so long.</p> <p>"Thanks for the shower," he walked towards the door. He knew he sounded like a pimp-licker in the midst of a sale. He knew he'd lost his mind a long time ago, how much he'd missed her so damn. Now, he had to say goodbye. That was why it didn't bother him so much. It never bothered him to do what needed to be done.</p> <p>He grabbed the back of the door frame and walked towards his shower. Once he was through, he turned back and said something to her.</p> <p>"I need to leave the hotel" she spoke softly to him as she stepped out of the shower. He could see her eyes light up when she saw it, and he could feel her hand on his back.</p> <p>"It can't go on any longer," he started his story. "The girls are coming over tomorrow."</p> <p>There was something in her hand that was different now. It was the same look of hunger he'd seen during the last three months as she had been there. If she'd felt the same, why had a guy made her dinner? If she'd found a way to do that without being bothered by him, he wondered if that was all she really wanted? She knew him so well that the thought of her going away with more than one man at once was practically a foregone conclusion. He knew she'd be with just one or the other, but he'd never let on, and she didn't get to choose.</p> <p>She pulled away from him. He followed the sound of those words. His heart thudded. She had never asked a question so intimate. It would take her a month until she could say those things in a normal conversation. She didn't ask him about his personal life, but she never asked him his name, either one of them, whether he had a girlfriend. He didn't feel like that in a million years. And she knew it, too.</p> <p>"Is that all you really wanted from me?" Her voice sounded like a whisper in the shower. Her eyes twinkled at him. His cock hardened. She was just a woman; she'd never really thought him to be sexy. He took another step towards her.</p> <p>"What are you asking!" she said in an angry whisper. She grabbed the front of his shirt, and he stepped back from her. She pushed him towards the door with his hands outstretched and a mischievous gleam in her eye.</p> <p>"No, you do know that you can't leave now..." he started to apologize.</p> <p>"I'm not going to leave!" she said, and stepped closer. Her eyes held a certain level of authority; he knew it too. "You can't leave until we get home." Her lips brushed his. He could smell the faint odor of shampoo coming from the water. She took the moment to taste him. His lips parted, and they were drawn in by her. "We can't," he started again but stopped. His heart still pounded. He could feel himself becoming aroused again at the taste of her mouth. But, he needed to get out of here so he could get someplace, and besides, he didn't want to have to leave his wife for her. He was leaving that one day while he could. Maybe, he wasn't a one-hundred-percent bull anymore.</p> <p>"Let's go" he stepped out of the shower. He took her hand and they followed a few steps into the bedroom. "I'll go back into the bathroom," he said and left before she could say anything else. He took her hand and walked upâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
