When we got off the elevator he looked back at me with those deep, dark blue eyes and whispered, "I love you so much."</p> <p>My reply was to kiss him back, lick his ear and whisper, "Yes, I love you too. Now get going, go back to work and take care of some others."</p> <p>As I walked by I could hear him snoring softly. Then out of the elevator I headed back to work. I got the last order, a light lunch, and headed back to my office. The whole time I could feel myself getting hotter every time I turned the key. Each time I turned the knob to take off the blinds I could just catch a glimpse of my boss. He just smiled and shook my hand and told me he'd like to see me today. I told him I would, and smiled again. My mind was a whirl as I thought of what was to come.</p> <p>After the office was done I cleaned off my desk and headed to the washroom. I pulled up to Jim's desk and started reading his mail. At first I just ignored it as it was an unusually large stack of work. As I started reading it I realized it had all the information I needed. I opened my lunch drawer to retrieve my lunch. My hand stopped on my panties, because they were moist. I started to go back for my lunch as I quickly started pulling the panties back into the pile. It wasn't long after leaving the stack that I found it, sitting there was an envelope, wrapped in white envelopes. The next thing I knew was Jim opening this envelope and looking at it. He turned to the door and smiled "What the hell?"</p> <p>Then I realized, "Oh, good morning, lover. What are you doing opening this?" I couldn't believe what happened! I had just opened this, with a new job. But not now, not after last night. I turned and looked up at Jim. His face turned a deep red and his eyes started to tear up. It was then that I felt his hand brush my breast, so quickly I knew we both needed something inside us.</p> <p>Jim grabbed the two envelopes, turned to me and dropped the first one into my hands, and then handed the other one to the mailman. "I got a delivery this morning from you sir. This is for you sir." He took the envelopes from me and said, "Get that envelope, please do the next two things. Now, go get ready to leave, I don't want to have to explain anything." Jim smiled at me again, and started to move out the door before I could ask him what he thought.</p> <p>My mind seemed to be racing now. This was the last straw and I was too afraid to ask him to be more specific. I had to think of a few things. So, I just stood there and let him pass through, as he turned back he noticed my breasts, I'm sure my nipples were hard. As he passed through the door he stopped, looked over my shoulder to see the mailman watching us both. He then turned and walked out the door and out of my office. "Damn, that's one hell of a way to wake up! Get dressed, now and go home. Remember to come back tomorrow." He told me later that there was no way he wouldn't tell me what had happened the last time I had seen him. I walked out the door, feeling like my marriage might be in a whirl.</p> <p>When I got home I took a quick shower and got dressed up. I was putting on a skirt that barely covered my ass. Then I went to get my favorite heels. Then in just the heels I picked up something and laid it on the table. I put on a new one from the dresser. This time, instead of my bra, I put the dress on, but put on a pair of the thigh highs and the little G-string. That just left my slit panties, black with black heels, with no straps. When I tried to put on some thong panties, I couldn't stop myself, but I couldn't pull them on either. Then I tried on a dark red dress and put it on. Then I grabbed my clutch purse and left. The drive home was a blur. Each step I took had me shaking in places I had never felt as nervous as I did now. I was afraid to tell him that because he'd have a hard time explaining it to me. I had to get home before some people saw me in it, but as I drove I couldn't stop thinking of what we could do with our little adventure. As I pulled into the garage I realized that I wasn't going to be able to walk to work the next day. "How can I get home like this?" I said to myself, thinking.
