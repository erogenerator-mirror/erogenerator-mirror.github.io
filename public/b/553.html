After the shower I changed into a fresh pair of pants, took a long hot shower, then got dressed. As I stepped out into the main room, I heard my neighbor's voice.</p> <p>"Well, the weather in St. Maarten was horrible last Friday," my wife says in her best southern accent.</p> <p>"Uh, can't we talk about it after dinner?" I asked.</p> <p>"Sure, baby, but first, you want to go out for some coffee, have a drink?"</p> <p>I was a little surprised but was already dressed and ready to go.</p> <p>"Sure, what?"</p> <p>"I want to go out with the guys tonight," my wife answered.</p> <p>"Okay, if you like. Maybe we could catch up on a little. But right now we can do some dancing and maybe grab some dinner, okay?"</p> <p>"Yeah, sure, sure, honey," I agreed as I started to get the door and turn to go back.</p> <p>"Hey, don't even think about turning in early, you're really going out with us tonight," my wife said as she slipped a key in the door, "I'll be back in fifteen." then slipped away leaving me completely confused.</p> <p>Well, I turned to her and looked back and grinned as she said, "You know I'll be back before you know it, sweetheart, you're a great kid."</p> <p>"Yeah, okay," I agreed, "I'll call you soon."</p> <p>"Bye." And with that, she was gone, I walked out of the house and off to the coffee shop.</p> <p>Once inside, I ordered a large coffee cup and sat down on the love seat. A couple of minutes later I heard a knock on my door. At least, I thought that was what it looked like. Just then, a woman's voice, female, said, "Hello?"</p> <p>"Come in, sweetheart. What can I get you?" I asked.</p> <p>"A coffee, please, sugar. And a beer for the lady," she said as she led me into our small but good-sized apartment, still quite modestly furnished as she had been.</p> <p>"Is coffee okay?" I asked.</p> <p>"Of course. Would you like coffee?"</p> <p>Wow, a woman's manners, no, not coffee, you guessed it.</p> <p>"Just a beer would be fine."</p> <p>We talked about it for a little while, neither of us saying much. Well, I did start to get a little aroused but was so horny, I didn't know what to do with myself. I looked around at what she had to offer; it was pretty neat and well decorated.</p> <p>Then, she smiled at me and we went back to watching a movie while I finished off the coffee. She was obviously happy to see me, and I was happy to have her company.</p> <p>The movie was about two guys who had sex in every hole in the house, she laughed at the one guy who was a real stud. When he was done, it was only her and the TV. She gave me this funny little smile and started to get up. She was still just sitting on the love seat, her knees pulled up, not sure if she should or should not be, so she didn't move to her feet.</p> <p>Then I saw her legs open, she wasn't wearing any panties. And all of a sudden I saw her looking at herself in the mirror as she walked back, she didn't stop, she just stood there, smiling.</p> <p>I looked around, I could feel my erection rising and knew it was getting real.</p> <p>She walked in and sat down on the love seat again. She looked down at my crotch for a minute, I knew she could sense it, but she seemed quite unconcerned.</p> <p>"Are you okay," I asked, concerned she might think I had gone too far.</p> <p>"Yes, honey, I'm fine. Let's just watch the movie," she answered.</p> <p>We watched the movie, she told us how the movie was turning her on, which she told me was more than okay for the moment. Actually, she told us more, as the scene got better.</p> <p>I asked her if she had ever fooled around before with younger men before, she said no. She liked to give young men their first hand-job. But she said she liked to leave them tied up, that she needed to be prepared for the next one.</p> <p>"So, how does the movie go," I asked.</p> <p>"Oh, silly, you just had a drink," she answered with a smile.</p> <p>"Oh, okay, I'm kidding! It'll be just fine." I said, grinning to myself. She laughed and said, "I knowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
