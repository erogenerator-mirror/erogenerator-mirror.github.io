I'm not gay! I am NOT! This is wrong," she said, as she sat back on the bed and put her feet up on the bed behind her.</p> <p>I looked to my left, and saw that a large amount of dark liquid had collected in the corner of her mouth.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I did not mean to..." I said, looking directly down again.</p> <p>"I know. I should be ashamed of myself," she said.</p> <p>"I should not feel anything for you, as I was, because of your behavior of yesterday, but it has only just recently started to affect me."</p> <p>"But it had been almost three weeks! Surely, you could not have gone longer without making love to someone. I am really sorry."</p> <p>"I would never do that. You were my first woman," I assured her.</p> <p>"But you are a beautiful woman and I've had too much to drink to go with you," she said. "This is wrong!"</p> <p>"It has only just begun," I assured her. "I'm sorry, I did not mean to..." I stopped talking just before I had made an admission I had made that night in the bathroom of her hotel suite, and turned back to the bedroom.</p> <p>As I lay on the bed, her eyes were focused on me, one eye closed and the other open, her head back. I did not answer her as she made no move to take off the robe. I lay on the cool sheets as I listened to her breathing increase. And I heard, a slight giggle.</p> <p>Just before she had finished, she rolled over on to her stomach and raised her bottom off the bed. It was an odd position for her to be sitting that way, and I looked at the towel at the end of the bed. She lifted her bottom one more time, as if to cover herself. Then she raised her ass up to her chest. Her legs were still open, and I could see the dark crease she had left in the middle of her thighs.</p> <p>Then, from the hallway, with a light behind her, she went into the room. As I lay there, I could hear music in the background that someone had obviously turned on, and it brought me back to the moment when I knew the two of them had been making love.</p> <p>I looked at my watch and saw that it was now time to go. I went straight to the bathroom to clean up as much of the semen as I could, and to make sure that my roommate could not walk down the hall from the hallway. And when I entered the main room, I could hear them kissing. She was also being kissed by a man, but his arms were above his head, and she was pressing her breasts against him. Now that I was in the main room, I went back to the bedroom, turned on the TV, and went through the door into the hallway. At the end of the hallway, I could feel her presence, standing there with an arm over her shoulders. From the shadows on the hallway walls, I could make out that she was not wearing the robe that I wore over my bathing suit in the room. My body reacted to the sight of her, and it was clear that she saw the hardness protruding from me to make her face even more desirable.</p> <p>"I'm sorry about taking so long." As she spoke, she was removing the robe from herself.</p> <p>"It's okay. What's with the robe?" I asked.</p> <p>"I thought you said it was okay to take the time to undress?"</p> <p>"I did. I don't mind. I've liked the way you've dressed up lately. It's nice to see that people still want to be friends when we're in our early thirties, especially when you're my age. I think we should start having a normal life."</p> <p>"I've always been friends with you. I suppose I'm a little disappointed that the time that we spend together is no longer to include making love," she said with a small laugh.</p> <p>"Why don't you put on something a bit more comfy?" I said.</p> <p>My hands were already on the button of my sweatshirt, and she stood watching as I struggled with it as she undid the button. I slipped it off of my shoulders and let it fall to the floor. Then I kicked it under the bed, and she watched intently as I tossed it onto the clothes pile beside the bed. She still stood on the bed, as I moved over to her and undid her belt. I pulled her sweatshirt off over her head, and sat back down on the bed. This gave a glimpse of her naked upper body from where the covers were, and she was not wearing a bra.</p> <p>"There, now you can wear something for me." she said as sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
