Her voice was sultry.</p> <p>"Do we need to? I'll walk. We'll see where things go."</p> <p>Dale and Susan followed with Kay.</p> <p>Dale and Susan turned to me in the car.</p> <p>"Why on earth do we follow you here?" He asked. I couldn't respond. He continued driving.</p> <p>I followed him down an alley to the club's entrance. I parked.</p> <p>Kay and I walked into the club. We saw a very rowdy redhead dancing. She was naked. One guy had his arm around her while looking her up and down. He was trying to hide her breasts from the redhead's gaze. I noticed Susan had joined them in a circle dancing. I wondered what kind of show I would be to leave in such a short span of time. The sight of a beautiful naked girl dancing around the stage with someone else...and then being pressed up against him while his hands felt her breasts...I wanted to go home with that man and have fun all weekend.</p> <p>I watched as all the people in the club made their way toward me and Kay.</p> <p>Dale and Susan walked out of the building. When Dale walked towards Kay, Susan was already in the car.</p> <p>"Come with me," Susan said. "I have to get something to make the evening all go away." She led me out to a large back room. Susan handed me a set of chains. I walked back to the bar.</p> <p>"Are you ok?" Kay asked me.</p> <p>"I'm ok, really. I have to leave."</p> <p>"No! You can't. I won't let you. Don't you see I'm right in front of you. You're going to lose your wife and you may not even be able to do it."</p> <p>"Oh. Ok. I guess."</p> <p>Kay gave me a long look. She took out a rope from under the bar and walked over to where I was standing. She picked up a rope with small loops inside. She walked it up a couple of feet and laid it on the floor.</p> <p>"I have something special for you?" She handed me a small box.</p> <p>"What's the prize?" I asked.</p> <p>She handed me something from inside the box.</p> <p>"What is it?" I asked.</p> <p>"It'll make us even," she said.</p> <p>Dale and Susan both nodded.</p> <p>I took the box. Kay looked at me.</p> <p>"Go ahead and open it," she said.</p> <p>I opened the small box. Kay held up the white silk box and a thin chain. It felt like silk. It felt smooth, soft, and smooth, just like a silk scarf. It had a chain that wound around it with four loops, each one wrapped together to attach to the front of the box.</p> <p>"I thought you could do this," I said. I walked back to the bar.</p> <p>"You can't," she said. "Please. They will be gone before you've finished your drink."</p> <p>"Do you want me to take your clothes off?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Then do it."</p> <p>"But they won't be gone."</p> <p>"Just take your clothes off. We'll go back to our table," she said.</p> <p>"But I am nude."</p> <p>"Exactly!"</p> <p>"I'm not!"</p> <p>Dale laughed.</p> <p>"Take your clothes off, and put your collar on. You won't be sorry. We're going to have fun."</p> <p>"But I'm a married woman and you're naked," I said.</p> <p>"We're going to have fun, too, Kay. You'll see."</p> <p>I took my clothes off. I had just taken my socks off and had taken off my shirt. I looked at the clock. It was almost 1:00. I was going to have almost a whole hour to get out of the bar. As I looked at Kay, she had gotten up from her bar. She was naked except for her nipple clamps. She was holding something against her nipples. She took one step toward me. I walked away. She wrapped a rope around it to my chest, and then wrapped a rope around my leg and attached it to my collar.</p> <p>It felt to my chest like silk was wrapping around my leg.</p> <p>"Where are we going?" I asked.</p> <p>"To your car. I don't think you're gonna be able to drive home before the evening is finished," she said</p> <p>I looked away from her looking at the ring she had slipped in the box.</p> <p>"Do we want to go home?"</p> <p>"Not right now, but tomorrow.
