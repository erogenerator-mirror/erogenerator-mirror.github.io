They kissed passionately as he began to slide down her body.</p> <p>She opened her legs, welcoming the hot, probing fingers.</p> <p>"More," she cried.</p> <p>"Please."</p> <p>His hand reached inside her and her legs automatically spread even farther apart. Her panties still on, he felt her wetness and slowly slid a finger inside as his lips caressed hers.</p> <p>"Ohh..." she moaned in ecstasy.</p> <p>His lips closed around hers, as he slid them down and they kissed. His fingers slid in and out of her as their tongues tangled and she writhed on her back. Their bodies pressed as one, rubbing against each other as if they'd been caught in a hot vise.</p> <p>He lifted his body up and they stood on the sofa. There they kissed passionately as their hands explored their bodies. He lifted her legs up and put them over his shoulders, as he began thrusting steadily inside her. He loved the way her lips parted for him and her breasts flattened against his chest. His body pressed against her as he thrust into her hard. He felt her juices running down his thighs.</p> <p>His thumb rubbed the area, causing her to convulse against him.</p> <p>Her legs tightened against him and she pressed into him as she felt herself on the edge of an orgasm. She closed her eyes and leaned her head back. She screamed and he held himself still, then pulled out suddenly just as it was closing.</p> <p>"Wait."</p> <p>She opened her mouth and then closed her eyes again, as she heard the door close and then the sound of the closing curtains. It was a long moment again before she remembered where she was. She closed her eyes again, as she put her hand to her heart. This had to be it. She would find some way to get back there now, if she ever had.</p> <p>She sat up and took a deep breath. She was ready, she thought. There was one thing she did not want any part of. The last thing she wanted to do was to turn her lover into some kind of whore.</p> <p>She knew, but she couldn't see it in her hands. She took a deep breath and looked out the window again.</p> <p>She couldn't hear what was going on anywhere in the apartment. She didn't mind the silence - there was nothing to tell. It was just a few feet away. She sat down and put her mind to rest. She had to get out of there.</p> <p>Her thoughts ran wild and her heart hammered. She could not keep it in anymore. She threw caution to the wind and moved toward the phone. There was a cordless phone on the bedside table and she pushed it forward so that it hit into the empty space.</p> <p>"You bastard!" she swore as she snatched the receiver from the cradle, where she'd put the phone there.</p> <p>She pulled the cordless from her purse and put it in the cradle, as she quickly undid the jeans. She pushed her shorts down and stepped out of them. Her panties slipped over her hips and she wrapped them tightly around her legs, as her hands moved to her hips and she pulled her pantyhose down to her ankles. The panties, too? How could she do this?</p> <p>As she leaned forward, the material of her bra slid down her arms and slipped off. She pulled it along with the bra and tossed it onto the bed.</p> <p>There was another cordless phone in the cradle on the bed and she picked it up. She listened for a moment but couldn't hear anything in the background.</p> <p>She moved to the bed. "What are you doing?" she demanded.</p> <p>The voices in the background were getting louder. She could make out the words but couldn't understand them.</p> <p>"It's about you...about where you are...that's all," he said softly.</p> <p>She heard the door to the apartment open and close again. She heard the television turn on and the sound of the door opening. She saw him standing there.</p> <p>"You have to believe me," she said.</p> <p>He grinned at her and pulled her toward him.</p> <p>"You do?" she demanded. "Don't beat yourself up."</p> <p>"This," he said as he held her at arm's length. He cupped her face in his hands and kissed her softly on the lips.</p> <p>She pushed him away. "Not here," she said.</p> <p>"You want me," he said as he moved toward her. She pulled her lips away from his and pushed him toward the door.</p> <p>She reached out and grabbed him by the shirt collar, as she moved behind him to take the phone from his hand.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" she demanded.</p> <p>He didn't answer. He moved one hand around her back to unhook her braâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
