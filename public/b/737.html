"I just don't mean to be..."</p> <p>She had to stop herself from running her hands through his dark hair, even though it was all in her face. He was so tall that he barely stood in the middle of the room, her breasts jiggling beneath her bra, but at least he still had a face. She felt his hot breath on her neck, and she shivered, her nipples hardening under his breath as he moved into her, their lips meeting on a searing kiss that left her breathless.</p> <p>"You really are something else, and you'd kill me if I kept you from your..."</p> <p>He lifted his head from her neck and looked into her eyes, trying to gauge her reaction. She looked back at him then, unsure what to do. He wasn't a stranger. He was her brother.</p> <p>"Yes. I've known you since day one, and I've always had you. You look beautiful in your blue eyes, Angelica. And your hair is a little longer than it used to be; and my eyes can tell if you're not wearing anything underneath that skirt."</p> <p>He moved over to stand by the chair, leaning against it for support. With every inch that he moved, his mouth brushed hers and she felt as if she were about to fall over. He'd known her for so long, she only knew by the looks he gave her and the kisses he allowed her to share.</p> <p>"And you're... You're gorgeous," he whispered as he ran his hands in her hair.</p> <p>"I know," she answered as his hands began to slowly move over her body. "You must think I'm pretty, then."</p> <p>His smile broadened as he pulled her closer. She pressed herself against him, and with her free hand, she reached around him and began to unbutton his shirt. Her fingers grazed his skin and she felt his heartbeat quickening in her mouth. He dropped the shirt and moved his hands back to her hair, cupping her face as they moved. She knew he was as close to coming as she was to losing him just by coming. With a sigh, she pressed her mouth against his neck, gently biting his flesh. The sound of her teeth rasped through his groan, and she grinned.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah," he murmured in her ear. His hands slid down her body and he cupped her ass in his hands, drawing a little moan from her throat.</p> <p>"It's not so late now," he said in her ear as he began to nibble it then nipped it with his teeth.</p> <p>"I know," she said quietly. He was so sexy, she could practically feel him moving in her as he nibbled her ear. "You must be very lonely here."</p> <p>"I am, and I really don't have someone in mind to share the bed with tonight," he replied as he moved to sit down instead of resting in the chair. "And I'm sure we can find us a cozy little corner."</p> <p>"Yeah, the one we can share a bed with," she said, sitting up to lean forward to meet his lips to his.</p> <p>~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p> <p>He let his hands run over her shoulders. It was a little unusual for him to do this before they had been in the room; he enjoyed the feel of her body against his, and it made him smile whenever he thought of how good it would be to make love to her again, but that didn't mean he couldn't see a thing. He moved one hand under her sweater and traced his fingers along her bra as he ran the other up her back to pinch her nipple.</p> <p>"I just realized something, Angelica," he said as she sat still. He didn't want to wait until they were alone to ask her what was on her mind, and his stomach flipped. Not since that night had he thought he could ask her about anything, let alone his feelings for her.</p> <p>"What's up?"</p> <p>He nodded, not wanting to ruin their night in the worst way. He lowered his lips to hers and trailed his finger tips over her lips, her tongue licking at his fingers enticingly. His cock had remained hard all evening, and despite the fact that it always made him regret his lack of sleep, it didn't seem to bother him that it had taken longer than it should. He was still aching for her to be around him whenever they were together.
