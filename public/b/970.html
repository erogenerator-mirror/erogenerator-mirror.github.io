His fingers pulled the sides of her top to her stomach before slipping them up along her breast and onto her stomach. His fingers slowly stroked on over the side of her bra as his other hand held her shoulder tightly. Her breasts felt soft and soft against his hands and it was impossible to tell who was who in this situation.</p> <p>She felt him lean his head into her neck, his lips moving from her neck to her ear.</p> <p>"There will be other times, dear..." A familiar voice murmured in her mind. Her heart raced as she felt his hand glide along the edge of her bra just below her breasts. She didn't stop him as he gently pulled on her shirt and bra strap. It gave her a feeling of freedom, of being undressed by a complete stranger after she had been intimate with a man.</p> <p>The sensation of a second, more powerful sensation came from the touch of his finger on her bare skin. His hand moved along her breast until she instinctively spread her arms towards him.</p> <p>"Be still, dear. Enjoy." She had to remind herself to remain still as she felt her bra pulled away from her breasts in his hands. Then she felt his hands on her hips as he lowered her down until she was sitting on the edge of the Jacuzzi again. She sat there, with him holding her close and feeling his presence.</p> <p>His lips came closer and neared her ear. She felt his lips against her neck and then felt his hand slip inside her shorts and grasp both her legs in one hand. Her lips parted and her body took over as she began to feel his fingertips on her sensitive thighs. He stroked her as he kissed her as she looked back at him.</p> <p>"There will be others, dear. Now lay back." She was glad she hadn't worn briefs to sit on the edge of the Jacuzzi, as the sun would have been hot enough for the swimwear around the Jacuzzi to keep them from being soaked up.</p> <p>As his fingers began to slowly stroke over her thighs until he couldn't stand any more, she took her hands and placed them on his chest. He stood there holding both her legs in his hands. He began to kiss her calves; and she enjoyed the sensual caress. He kissed his way up to her thighs just above the tops of her shorts and then back down the center of it.</p> <p>He kissed her upper thighs as his hands moved up her body. She felt the touch of his lips all over her thighs but never touched them. She could feel him smiling against her skin as his mouth began to circle her pussy.</p> <p>Her breath was coming out in ragged pants.</p> <p>She could feel him moving from her legs, up the inside of her thighs and then back towards her crotch. Every time his lips neared her crotch she could feel him slide his fingers along her outer lips. She could smell her arousal as his fingers started slowly circling the inside of her inner lips. She felt herself tightening even more in her desire. She could tell that she was getting wetter than she thought. She could also feel him pressing his face deep into her lower abdomen.</p> <p>She shivered with excitement at the feel of his tongue gently parting her inner lips and searching for her clit. He knew that her orgasm wasn't far away and he wanted to taste her.</p> <p>Suddenly, she felt a finger slide down between her folds of skin and feel her wetness. It quickly began to penetrate her opening. She didn't dare close her legs, but tried not to think of closing them when she had that beautiful feeling of being fully penetrated. Her breathing was heavy. As her body began to jerk, she felt herself climaxing.</p> <p>Once again, she felt the pleasure of coming down from this incredible experience. She was breathing through her nose as she lay there, with her heart pounding to her chest. She almost jumped out of the Jacuzzi and ran to take her clothes off. She would wait until she was in the kitchen to get dressed and then shower, but it was now time to get dressed. She quickly pulled her top over her head and followed her top to the kitchen where the clothes were still scattered around the kitchen floor.</p> <p>She had not seen who was running out in the pool but heard the loud laughter of one of the men from the Jacuzzi. She hurried to the doorway to her bedroom and peeked out from behind the door. She saw that a man and a woman were in the Jacuzzi. The man was completely nude and the woman was wearing a robe.</p> <p>"Welcome! I'm Dr. Williams." He said as he came down the tub. "You may look at me. Please." She reached out to him and she could feel his body in her fingers. He leaned towards her and they touched when he reached behind him to undo the towel at the back of his robeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
