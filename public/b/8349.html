She turned around and pressed her legs together. He kneeled down behind her, leaned forward, and kissed the back of her neck, then licked slowly from her shoulder down the back of her neck, making her purr. When he got to her shoulders he licked her neck before turning her onto her back. She felt his hands grip her ass and spread her legs wide. He kneaded and fondled her breasts, and his hands came up to finger her vagina. He pushed the heel of his hand into her, thrusting it in and out. His tongue worked her clit, and he kissed her belly as he worked his hand in and out of her. He licked a finger and inserted it into her anus, and when he did he finger fucked it.</p> <p>"Oh, fuck, you feel so good," she said as her hips rocked. She wanted him in her right away.</p> <p>He leaned to his left, and she felt his large cock press against her lips. He reached out for a condom, then stopped and turned back to her. "This isn't a condom, is it?" he questioned.</p> <p>She shook her head no, then gasped as he slid the condom onto his already rigid cock. He turned and entered her in a single thrust. She was already wet, and this time was no virgin. She was moaning and groaning, almost begging. He reached up and squeezed a breast as he slowly rocked her. He felt her respond, and was rewarded by her first orgasm of the evening. His shaft pistoned in and out of her, feeling the warmth of her vagina. Her body started to sweat, but she didn't care. She felt him coming and then felt his semen fill the condom. She let out a deep, satisfied groan and he pulled out of her.</p> <p>They collapsed on the bed, his arms wrapped around her. He whispered, "I'm sorry I got you all hot tonight."</p> <p>"You were hot tonight, too, didn't you?" she replied. She gave his cock a squeeze again, feeling it harden. He was hard now, so she rolled over and got on top. She rode it slowly, letting her breasts bounce with every bounce. "I loved fucking you," she said, her body wriggling and sliding on him. "I've never done anything like this before," she exclaimed as she took him back into her mouth. She didn't have to ask, and knew it was a good sign. She let his cock out of her mouth so she could watch his facial expressions as she slid up and down on his shaft. "This feels good," he said, as he turned her onto her belly. She smiled as she felt his cock press against her. "I'm not big, but I won't be if you lie to me," she said, taking his cock into her hand and guiding it inside her. He pressed inside, a little deeper each time.</p> <p>"You're going to last a long time," she said. She looked at him over her shoulder, her hands guiding his cock into her. He pressed into her harder. "Just try to make me cum," she said breathlessly. "Just like you did the first time."</p> <p>She felt his cock swell, and knew he was coming. She could feel it swell even more, and she felt his semen flooding out of her vagina. He leaned forward and they kissed, tasting the differences in their tastes, and he said, "I wanted to tell you my name."</p> <p>"It's Angel," she said.</p> <p>"I love this position," he said. He leaned forward to kiss her face. "When we got to the bed we really had one orgasm, I got to you first, and then there were twoâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
