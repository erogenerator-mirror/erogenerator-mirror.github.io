What is it that you have been dreaming about? I know you've always thought of me that way, but how can you have been living your life this way now?"</p> <p>I was stunned; there was no possible answer.</p> <p>"I've never told you... this," I said finally.</p> <p>"I've never heard you talk this much," she said, looking a bit disappointed.</p> <p>"I mean, you're my sister, so I'm not going to... well... I've been thinking about how I've been treating you. It's been such a long time."</p> <p>"I... well, maybe..." she said, suddenly sounding a bit apprehensive, "I don't want to start..."</p> <p>"You're just curious," I said with a smile, "it's all good... I'm just a little surprised at how... we've been. I've been thinking that I could be helping you with a lot more than just being a sister to you, but..." I had to ask as I realized how much I couldn't ask her on my first day of college.</p> <p>"Oh... I understand," she said with a nod of her head.</p> <p>"Well, if I may be so bold, can you tell me the story of what you have been so long..." I said, trying to sound casual.</p> <p>"Of course, I'll be there next..." I said, almost as though I was trying to sound casual.</p> <p>When I went inside a little while later, I sat down and began to formulate my thoughts about what I would say to her.</p> <p>"Um, what have you been doing with your boyfriend?" she asked.</p> <p>"He's... never really... really. Just sort of hanging out with the guys, they're not really my style and I've just never really had the time."</p> <p>"I can relate," she said, then added with a shy smile, "what about you? I've never even heard of any boys having... what... mutual boyfriends..."</p> <p>Before I could respond, I saw her hand shake, as though she was reaching for something. Looking at me with that shy smile again, she said, "I guess I have to come right out and say it. I've dated men since before our high school days so the idea of meeting a... uh..."</p> <p>She stopped talking as we were putting our things away.</p> <p>"Hey, don't worry," I said, "I'm just the type that likes to keep things that are just that much more personal. Plus, I don't know if any of my closest friends would agree to sharing a woman with me. It's kinda like 'if the girl wants it all' and..."</p> <p>"You're asking a lot of people to sleep with you," she said, suddenly sounding angry. "I can't believe that you want a girlfriend; a boyfriend; some dude... well we've already spent time together since last Thursday, haven't we?" "I don't see how I could ask a girl in the room for sex," I said.</p> <p>"Well... I mean... you know," she said, and started fidgeting once again. "So anyway, this... girl... can you tell me about... the first time you had a girlfriend? Tell me about..."</p> <p>"Okay. Well," I said softly as I looked at her for a bit, "that was some weekend last weekend when I was out on patrol."</p> <p>"I know, I'm just nervous that you might think that I'm some kind of... strange one," she said, getting her point straight. "Now if you were... a..."</p> <p>I wasn't really expecting her to say yes, but it looked like she wanted to.</p> <p>"I've been spending time just sitting around on a beach and watching the sun go across the ocean. And it's been very warm, and all kinds of... stuff going on down there."</p> <p>"It's been pretty hot... but what's it like up in that damn cabin?" she teased, still fidgeting. "Or is it just that hot in the cabin?"</p> <p>I had to tell her that that was nothing to be worried about, and I decided I didn't want to end the conversation right now by letting it go.</p> <p>"You have no idea," I said. "It's kind of weird, but I wouldn't mind spending a few minutes in nature with you... or, if you would like," I said a bit shyly.</p> <p>"That sounds nice," she answered with a smile.</p> <p>"Yeah," I said, "let's go for a walk."</p> <p>We walked out to the beach, and it felt very cool and peaceful there, with little breeze.
