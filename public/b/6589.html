But I like talking to you. When you're feeling a little stressed out, I'm sure I can help you get over it." She said as she leaned in and gave me a quick kiss. "I know you want me to go on about this new relationship. I thought you'd enjoy it, and don't you want to know about mine?"</p> <p>She was lying to me, too. "But when there's that big, beautiful young thing with those lovely firm breasts I was talking about earlier, it's hard to concentrate, right?"</p> <p>"Yeah it gets tougher, but that's the way it sometimes is. It's fun for all concerned. I love when you talk to me like this." She smiled a little and nodded a little. "So here's the deal. I'm the boss and you're the boss. You get to keep my little slut company, and I get an even bigger share of business. You can also get to use a bed on the weekends, you can have free rein."</p> <p>She was pretty excited now and I'm sure I had enough for some time. "How do I do that?" She asked as she gave me a playful thrust.</p> <p>"Just give me a little room to get ready and get in the mood, please." I smiled at her.</p> <p>She gave me a playful squeeze, "No, not tonight! After tonight I'm going to take a little nap on the couch. It's been awhile." Then she gave me a wicked little smile.</p> <p>"I think I might have a way to keep my mind from wandering off to the next time." I thought to push a little more than I wanted. "You could change into some fancy clothes and I guess I could find something else." I said to her before I got a mischievous grin in my eye and shook my head.</p> <p>"You're so funny!" She exclaimed, as she rolled me onto my back and planted a long, hot, tongue-filled kiss on my lips. "But, first, I have to get ready, I'd love to make up for all of this time and trouble. But, since you promised, I'd like to put it off until tomorrow."</p> <p>She slipped off the couch and began running all over me, kissing, licking and nibbling wherever she put her lips. I don't know what made me want her this deeply, but I don't think I would have thought a cocken's worth of pleasure would be waiting in the way of my pussy being filled.</p> <p>"What time is it?"</p> <p>"It's 7:55, how about you? I'll pick you up around 4."</p> <p>She gave me a quick peck on the lips then, she gave me one more before she got out of the living room. "But don't you have to work tomorrow, honey?"</p> <p>I was glad I'd had something on my mind. "I'll be out as late as I can manage." I assured her.</p> <p>The week dragged on by as she packed, unpacked and headed back to school. I think, if it was the right thing to do, she'd be a good subject to talk about for a while. I'd just about had it coming. I spent the night in bed again and, when I awoke, I was wondering if I'd be able to go again.</p> <p>The next morning she was out. I decided to take a little longer to get started and get to bed before I decided to give it a rest. Instead, I took a hot shower. I thought about how badly I wanted her to be in bed with me, and hoped she would come back. With thoughts of what's been going on, I stripped off my bikini and went to the bed.</p> <p>"Come here, you little slut." I demanded.</p> <p>I walked up the hallway of our bedroom. When I reached the door I saw that she was in bed, but I couldn't see her. I tried to close the door slightly ajar a bit, but it would have knocked down on all of us. So, I opened the door wide and, on my way in, I reached under my bed and pulled out my little toy. I don't know if it was in my room and I really don't care if it was still there or not, but my toy was on the bed.</p> <p>I put the toy in my mouth, sucked the toy and the rest of my body into it, and got into bed with her. I had no idea where to begin, but, I wasn't going to give her the opportunity to stop me. And I certainly wasn't going to take the time to change this thing into something that was not going to cause any problems. I would do what I had to, though.</p> <p>"Do you trust me?" I asked her.</p> <p>She shook her head.
