She called out. "The heat in here is going to burn us all out!" she laughed, reaching for her clothes. As she opened them, she couldn't help be surprised, she was just in a state of shock at what she felt. Her nipples grew even harder as she saw her tight shorts stretch and tear. The fabric was so small, it pulled around her hips, drawing tight against her pussy. It left her hips and lower thighs, leaving her legs in full view.</p> <p>Her stomach was flat as though she hadn't done a day of yoga in so long, her stomach and breasts flat, her stomach flat but her ribs were pointing out. Her legs looked so delicate, so long, so soft and smooth to touch. Her shorts were soaked from her sweat pouring down her legs and now had dried spots all around.</p> <p>"We have to get out of here, we are in for the last leg of this evening!" She said with a smile.</p> <p>She reached for the shower wall and pulled her body close. Her hands began to massage down her body, and as she reached her stomach, she began to run them over her breasts, feeling the sweat and her sex rise up. Her hands moved her bikini top out of the way, and she ran her fingers over one breast and then across it. A small moan of pleasure escaped her body and she ran her fingers across it ever so slowly, then up her other cheek, pausing at the neck and then again her lower. Her hips moved closer to the edge of the tub, and as she felt her pussy growing wetter, she reached back, lifting her ass, spreading her legs.</p> <p>Her hand reached back to her ass, and as she grabbed her cheeks, her hand reached between them again. She pulled the cheeks apart, and she felt two of her fingers slide in, past her ass, then deep inside of her wet pussy. He eyes closed in lust as she touched herself, touching her very own hot, wet sex. Her legs opened even wider at the feeling of her hands on her sex, and each stroke was so slow. She squeezed her legs together as she felt herself coming. Her head arched back and her body convulsed, feeling her fingers in her pussy. She felt an orgasm rip through her and she collapsed into the tub, her muscles clenching tight in her stomach.</p> <p>"I just needed to lay there and let..." she said, running her fingers through her own hair. She leaned back and slid her fingers in her mouth, tasting her taste on her lips. Her orgasm had taken her completely and it was almost more than she could stand.</p> <p>"I'm gonna go change, I'll be right out, if you want" She said to her roommate as she stood up and her hand was on her ass, pulling her close.</p> <p>"Oh yeah, I do need to change also." Jessica said, sliding off her robe and slipping out of her soaked clothes. She walked down the hall to the first door on her left, opened it and slid her hand inside. It was the second door on the right, and she slipped inside, closing the door behind her. She pulled down the light switch, and turned the lamp on. As she was turning the light and switch back on, she dropped her top over the back of the chair and went to lay down again in her bed. She closed her eyes and drifted off to sleep without a thought to what was happening to her.</p> <p>After a few minutes, she rolled over, and the light was still on. She couldn't get out of bed, and it took her just a few seconds to regain her legs. She stretched out again in her bed, and the soft sheets were cool against her back. She pulled the cover up, reached below and pulled on her socks.</p> <p>As her feet climbed over the cold sheets, she opened her eyes, and with the dim light, she looked down at the naked body lying beside her. She opened her eyes wider as she looked closely, realizing that the wet, naked body laying next to her must have been her roommate.</p> <p>Jessica stood at her bed, her eyes staring into the dark of her room as she looked. Her face felt so warm, so inviting. Her hands reached up to pull the covers back, and her back arched as she felt herself being pulled towards her. As she stood, her lips brushed her roommate's, and they were suddenly as though they wanted to consume her whole.</p> <p>"I just had the best sex, last night" She whispered into her ear, and then her mouth pressed to hers. Her lips locked on hers, and their tongues met in a passionate battle. She moaned as the hands on her ass kept sliding under her panties, feeling the wetness grow between her legs. She felt a mouth on her neck, feeling the hard nipples press againstâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
