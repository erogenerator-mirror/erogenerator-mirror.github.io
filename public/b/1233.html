He smiled.</p> <p>"I know," I sighed, turning around. My face was flushed.</p> <p>He looked over to see me walking towards him, my nipples protruding through the thin material of my t-shirt. He glanced down and looked the same. I walked slowly towards him.</p> <p>We kissed again, a soft, tender kind of kiss that brought a new sensation to me. It also served to push my hand up between us to stroke his crotch through his jeans. He moaned for me.</p> <p>I pulled off his t-shirt and kissed down his body, my hands roaming over it, taking it off over his belt, dropping it to the floor. I was hungry for his lips again, and he groaned when I pulled his jeans down to his ankles.</p> <p>I kissed from his chin, down his neck, and his chest as I went. I moved my hands over his boxer briefs. He was hard, rock hard as my hands slid across it.</p> <p>He groaned at the touch of my soft hands to his cock. The t-shirt left it covering him down to his ankles in its confines. He sighed with pleasure as I wrapped my hand around his cock. He moaned in turn as my hand stroked his cock, getting him more excited.</p> <p>Finally, I leaned further forward and kissed his neck before wrapping my hand around his cock.</p> <p>"Ooh," he whispered.</p> <p>I leaned further up so that my nipples brushed against his chest and I was completely in control. I kissed down his neck again, then to his chest. He groaned his approval when I kissed over his nipples, moving over them. They were now rock-hard and sticking out prominently. I felt the heat of my own nipples brushing his bare chest and the soft skin of his stomach.</p> <p>I leaned down a little more and took his cock in to my mouth for the first time. The sound of the velvety feeling of his cock in my mouth pushed me closer to ecstasy. I heard him make a few sounds, trying hard not to move too fast. I felt him tense above me, and heard him whimper his pleasure as my own hips rocked up against his.</p> <p>I felt his hands come up and grab onto my hips, guiding my thrusts with him. I kept my head tilted down, wanting to stay with him. I felt his grip on my hips tighten as his hands were pressed against my hips. I had wanted him to do that to me, I thought to myself with a smile.</p> <p>Suddenly, I felt a loud scream from the bed and I almost stopped moving. I looked back to see what he was doing. He had his legs over my head and was thrusting into me into the bed.</p> <p>He cried out a second later, his body tensing, and held my hips. He cried out again, his cock twitching in my mouth as it erupted, spewing rope upon rope into my mouth. His breath was coming in quick pants as he fought for air, but I could see his eyes still on mine. He had such a sexy, satisfied look on his face I couldn't imagine not being in that position anytime soon.</p> <p>As he began to calm down, I stood up and kissed his lips again. He kissed me back, his mouth on my face, his hands on my breasts. I pulled back a couple of inches and looked into his eyes.</p> <p>"I'm sorry I went so far the other day," I whispered to him.</p> <p>He smiled, then asked. "Is that because of me?"</p> <p>"Not really."</p> <p>"Want to have sex with me again," he asked, looking me in the eye.</p> <p>I thought for a second. "Sure," I smiled, "but right now I'd rather not."</p> <p>"Good," he responded, "because this time is going to be different than the last time."</p> <p>"I agree," I smiled.</p> <p>He looked me in the eyes and said, "You know I have to get back before I go crazy with hormones again." He was grinning at me as he said that. "Don't worry. Maybe we'll get along just fine."</p> <p>"Okay," I said with a smile. "I'm only kidding."</p> <p>"If you're not, then I'll get my share of it," he said with an enigmatic grin.</p> <p>"Let's go for dinner in the city again," I said quietly. I knew he wanted me to stay a while longer, and he was really into it.</p> <p>"Mmmm, that sounds like fun," he said with a chuckle.</p> <p>"I'd be happy to stay for dinnerâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
