When both of your lips are close enough you take my head in your mouth and swirl your tongue around the top and the shaft then up again. My own cock pulses with pleasure at the contact between your lips and tongue. Finally you begin sliding your lips up and down, side to side, licking the head with the tip of your tongue, your lips and tongue pressing into my shaft, causing me to groan with pleasure.</p> <p>When you slide down on me I cannot hold back. My body responds, I thrust my hips upward and you slide back off me. "Please," I plead, "Please don't stop."</p> <p>Your smile tells me I have just earned my reward. Just as I am about to tell you to stop I feel your hand on my balls, gently rubbing them, massaging them, pinching them. I moan loudly at the feeling of your first slow stroke.</p> <p>"You feel so good, baby, so damn good."</p> <p>"I love the way you have teased me." You whisper softly to me.</p> <p>"So how do you think I feel?" Your voice is a little breathy with desire, "I love the hard, hot feeling between my legs." Your hand continues its slow, teasing strokes.</p> <p>I feel as if my nipples are about to fall out. I know I am not very loud. You continue to stroke me while you whisper these words into my ear.</p> <p>"You're so wet and so hot."</p> <p>My own heart beats wildly in my chest. I can no longer think clearly. My eyes are wide open in an unbelieving trance. It feels as if I am about to explode if you don't take immediate action.</p> <p>"Do you want me?" you ask me.</p> <p>"Oh, God," I groan loudly.</p> <p>Your smile broadens when, after the fifth or sixth time you stroke me, you release me. The feeling is incredible. My body trembles as I try to comprehend what's happening.</p> <p>My head is spinning with sensation. You lift your legs and hook your feet on my waist. I can't move much below the waist. Your weight is on my body and my cock is being held securely against your pussy. You begin rotating your hips, moving me up and down between the lips of your pussy. You begin stroking every part of your body with my cock that is not being held against your body by your legs, feeling the slight pain you are causing. The stimulation is wonderful. Your words are almost too much and almost, as if a light bulb might come on in my head, you add, "fuck me."</p> <p>I'm nearly in shock with the intensity of the feelings and the feeling of what I have just found to be heaven. My head drops back and I begin moaning at the intense pleasure. You let out a long, soft moan that I've heard before, but the sound is lost in the intensity of the sensations you're having on your body. You push hard against my body. Then, you slide slowly downward.</p> <p>I can't move, can't breathe, can't talk. Your body presses against me and you feel it, feel the intensity of your own passion. Your motion, your strokes, the excitement of this new discovery, feel what I am experiencing. Your lips are wet and full of mine, your body is totally under my control, and it feels, too, just wonderful to be apart from you.</p> <p>After about thirty seconds of this intense pleasure it's too much and I am gasping for air. You slide up and down, your eyes closed. My hands are still firmly attached to your body and I begin to wonder what you will do next.</p> <p>You move more quickly. The intensity is building. My cock feels as if it's about to explode. It feels as if I'm about to explode. You keep it up. Slowly, oh so slowly at first, you slide your hips back and forth on my cock, stopping only when you reach the lips of your pussy.</p> <p>"Oh," is all I can say.</p> <p>You slow again, still sliding back and forth just an inch at a time. Your body is shaking as my cock is buried in your body. Each time you slide down it is a little deeper this time, but you're so tight on me and I can't move much at all. You keep stroking, but it's no longer just the cock inside you. Your movements are very sensual. When your pussy starts to squeeze rhythmically on my cock you begin moaning louder.</p> <p>"Oh yes," you cry out.</p> <p>I feel myself about to explode so intensely that I can't hold back any longer. I feel my knees buckle as I try to hold in so long I can't breathe.
