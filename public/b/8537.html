Her breathing was becoming heavier as her body shook with her lust.</p> <p>I knew this was going to happen, I was so close to it, but I remained motionless and let my erection slide out of her and her body collapse on top of my own. We held each other as I continued to rub my finger up and down her slit. The warmth of her body on me was so sweet and erotic.</p> <p>She turned around on top of me and slowly lowered herself on to my penis. She had never done it this far before and I thought that it was a first for her. However, I soon found out when I looked into her face.</p> <p>"So nice," I commented.</p> <p>She smiled at me and gently started to move down on to my penis. Although she had never done this before I was so excited that I began to move our hips in unison. She had a smile on her face as she started to suck my cock. She stopped before I shot a load of hot, salty cum in her mouth. She just looked at me and said,</p> <p>"Mmm you taste as good as you do."</p> <p>Her hot breathe felt amazing on me. I could feel the warm sun through her bathing suit. She moved her breasts up and down along with the inside of her breasts. Her breasts were so firm and round. I could tell her nipples were so hard as she played with them. Then, she lifted myself off into my arms. We just looked out to sea as our bodies came together. Our breathing was ragged and ragged. I looked into her eyes. Our eyes were locked on each other. I moved my left arm in her and pulled her face back to mine. I kissed her. She returned my kiss with passion. I broke the kiss and kissed down her neck. Her face was a warm chocolate color. Her neck was so soft. I just had to look for that soft flesh.</p> <p>She turned her head around and looked out towards sea. "I missed you. I'm sorry I've been so busy."</p> <p>"It's ok, it was a really special weekend."</p> <p>"I can't believe things could be so wonderful."</p> <p>"It was good for us both. I missed you too."</p> <p>I could feel her heart beating in her chest as her body pressed tight to mine. We kissed while our hips kept moving in a circular motion. She was moaning at my tongue licking her lips. Our hips were slowly moving in a circular motion.</p> <p>I was thinking the same thing. I had never touched another woman sexually before but I could feel my body getting hot. All I could think about that night was how wonderful it had been for me. Then she suddenly stopped kissing me and lifted herself off my penis. She had been working herself up on top of me for a while now. I could see her pussy was leaking a clear liquid down between her legs. Just the sight of her pink opening made me so excited to just lick her slit. I knew she was close and I took care of her with my tongue. The feeling of her juice flowing out of her lips was wonderful. She tasted so sweet.</p> <p>She lay on top of me and kissed me with an intense look in her eyes. We were still like two animals fighting as our hands explored each others' body. At last, she got off of me. I couldn't take anymore. I lifted her around her body on top of me. We kissed passionately again on my mouth. She moved her face and pressed it all over mine. We kissed again as our hands groped and moved all over each others bodies. I started to caress her body. I was really turned on. She had always been so shy about showing off in front of others. This night changed the world and we just let our hands run all over each other's bodies. Finally, I reached her breasts and rubbed my hands all over them.</p> <p>I felt the tension in her muscles all along her body. She had a look of excitement on her face as her eyes watched me. I pulled her body to mine and slowly started to run my hand along her slit as my tongue gently caressed her ear. She moaned softly at that, and I could feel her heart race. I could feel her body tense as she slowly lowered her head towards my mouth kissing me with passion.</p> <p>I wanted to explore her body but was about to stop from her.</p> <p>She quickly sat up and said, I'm so hot. I thought you were so hot too.</p> <p>"I like the way you feel."</p> <p>Then, she smiled and whispered,</p> <p>"Are you ready to have me?"</p> <p>"Yes, please, but before we do anything you might want to take off the bottoms first."</p> <p>"Oh I would love thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
