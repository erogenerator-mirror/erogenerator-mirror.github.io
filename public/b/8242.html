He said.</p> <p>"So we can get even more intimate by fucking each other here." I explained as I pulled my cock out of his ass hole, "But first you have to lick my mouth. That is a privilege that I will never do with any other man. I want him to taste like me." I moved over to the sofa near the entrance and motioned for Eric to kneel by his wife while I stood in front of him, taking him in my arms, kissing him, our tongues exploring each other's mouths. When I broke the kiss off, I had never been kissed like that and never experienced someone else being so passionate about it.</p> <p>"Now that's the part I want you to make me cum." I breathed while I reached down to his cock, which was now rock hard and standing up. "Just imagine I'm sitting in the room. All alone, watching you come. Do you really want to taste my come, right in front of me?" I asked as I rubbed my hand over his cock.</p> <p>"Do you really want to do that?" he asked.</p> <p>"I do." I said as I wrapped a hand around his cock and squeezed, then gave himself a nice firm squeeze as he nodded me to come.</p> <p>"Go for the throat," I instructed as I guided him to the sofa, "Grab the back of your knees and bend you over the back of the sofa, I want to fuck you from behind as you lick my cum from my ass hole."</p> <p>I pulled his cock back into his mouth and sucked the head while Eric held himself in place with two hands. I released Eric's cock from my mouth and took a step back. "On your back," I commanded. He moved to the middle of the room and lay on the floor, his head just on the end of the sofa and his legs held out flat by each of my sides. At this angle, he had an excellent angle to watch as I moved in position with my cock resting against his mouth, but the angle wasn't nearly as good. I moved to his wife.</p> <p>I pulled her to the middle of the room as she laid down on her back, her hair covering her face the same as her mouth and shoulders were, and I positioned myself so my shaft would be just at her mouth level. "Open your mouth, just as a slut would." I instructed. I took my cock in hand and stroked it and placed the head against her lips. She was now so excited by what I proposed she didn't even hesitate. She opened her mouth and I pushed my cock in. "Take his mouth with yours like a whore," I ordered. She started to work her jaw and took me all the way in, my balls dangling into her mouth. I wanted to take her in her pussy but it wouldn't be possible because her legs were already wrapped around my back, so I let her guide the movement of me in and out of her mouth, letting the saliva of our fucking juices run down her chin and into her mouth.</p> <p>I looked down at Eric. He had his eyes closed and was lost in thought, not sure at all how much pleasure he seemed to be in yet knowing how much I would continue to dominate his wife. She was taking everything I offered. My cock moved in and out of her mouth easily as she sucked on it as I slowly moved it in and out of her lips. I leaned forward until my cock was almost at her throat. "Hush now, slut." I whispered as I pushed my cock further into her mouth. She closed her eyes and breathed deeply.</p> <p>I pulled out of her mouth and told Eric to get on his knees. Once he was situated, I walked over to his wife, who I wanted to watch as I fucked her from behind. I looked at Eric while he knelt on the arm of the sofa, leaning forward on his elbows. She was on her knees with her hands in his hair, working the nape of his beard with his mouth. He was completely hard and his cock looked enormous with the purple head pointing at her crotch.</p> <p>"Now your turn," I said as I slid down to the floor, straddling his face. I had him spread his legs out on the floor with his hands in the air. I kneeled on the floor directly in front of him and grabbed one of his knees, spreading his legs as I pulled his legs wide with my arms, exposing his ass cheeks. I placed my cock between his legs and slowly slid it all the way back up him, feeling his wetness on it. I wanted to make it last, to feel his excitement as I fucked him from behind. My hips began to slowly rock back and forth, pushing my cock as far in him as I could without entering his ass. I kept this pace for a while, just enjoying the sensations andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
