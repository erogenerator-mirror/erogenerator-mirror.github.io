He wanted to tell her the whole story so she would understand if she was upset by what they had been doing. Tim was a bit surprised at how she'd handled things at work, and she seemed quite at ease at meeting men at other companies, as though it was natural. He was also pleased at how easy it had all been and that her mind had settled on what to do about her feelings for him.</p> <p>Tory and Ann were married a few months later and their relationship had quickly gotten into a whole new routine. During their meetings her office hours seemed to be filled with meetings with other work associates, her lunch in the afternoon was all about work. They got together almost every day or evening in an intimate way. One afternoon Tim took Ann to one of those private booths near the back where there were more private tables. When he arrived he got a surprise:</p> <p>Ann stood up abruptly. "Excuse me. Please sit down," Tim said to her.</p> <p>Ann sat down as Tim continued:</p> <p>"Before we begin our relationship there is one thing you have to understand," Tim began. "If you like your job there is another place that you may be able to visit."</p> <p>Ann nodded. "I think that would really be nice." Then she smiled at Tim. "But maybe for you," she said with a smile. "Maybe someday we could invite another company to join the company."</p> <p>Tim thought about it for a moment. "I guess that would be nice." Then he smiled at Ann and said, "This company would be a step further."</p> <p>Ann smiled. "I think we can work something out with that," she said.</p> <p>They talked about it a little more for a few more hours before Tim got up and left. Ann watched his retreating back as he got out of her office. Ann's work day was finished. They were going home.</p> <p>Ann's first two clients were men. One of them, Mike, had asked her out. She'd declined. They'd got together and Mike had said something to her about her need for some real "real sex" in her office. He had said that a relationship should be more than just sex. Ann had said that she loved her husband, but she was going back to her work. She'd had to be honest about it - as was Tim. She wasn't sure whether she would admit to her true feelings for him, but she had to tell them what they wanted to know.</p> <p>Ann returned to her home office as Tim had left. She had been sitting at the back of the office, trying to remember exactly what had happened when she got off her work call. She didn't remember coming home early. A couple of customers had asked her if she had heard from Tim and she was afraid that she would tell anyone for certain. She knew it was probably too late - they would never know anyway. When the next call came it lasted less than two minutes. Then she was getting dressed for the next customer and had finished just about all her paperwork. The next call came much too soon.</p> <p>This time she had told the other two men to be nice. She said they could have a small amount of company and she could bring a friend there. Her next call came at the last second. It was about 12:10 PM. Ann had called the next day and left a message. It had been very long. She said to check in for another day. This time when she finished this call, she would be out of here. Tim would be at the next table with her before she got off the phone and Tim got a nice surprise.</p> <p>Ann had been a model of efficiency. She had gone to the bar and had a couple of drinks and was beginning to wonder if Tim might like some wine after work. She had had several more to drink when Tim's voice came on.</p> <p>"You didn't finish your wine," he said with a wicked smile.</p> <p>Ann was laughing. "What does that mean?" She said to him.</p> <p>"How about we go to our table and I'll tell you," Tim said. "Then I'll come back later."</p> <p>Ann and Tim had dinner together the following evening after her call. This time the meal was a bit more elegant and more about getting to know one another. Ann had a job that she liked and Tim did very well at everything he did. But, Tim was very good. He treated Ann well, although he did ask very few questions - not about her sex life, but about the job. As time went on, they got to know each other. When he took Ann home they both went to bed earlyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
