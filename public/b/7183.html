And, what do you think? I'll call a cab, pick you up a pizza and maybe even a beer, okay? If you don't mind I could use a little something."</p> <p>"You can count on it." He answered. "I want to do this right. I want you, too. We're here just having a day, and we don't have to worry about what people say around us in our state."</p> <p>"I'll just have to make sure it's all made up before we go for a drive." I countered. "Besides, I could always change over at the hotel, if you don't mind."</p> <p>"You can stay just the way you are; I haven't had any clothes yet." He said with a sly smile.</p> <p>"You want me? I'll have to change too!" I said with a smile of my own.</p> <p>"It's not that... just... I didn't mean," he paused trying to decide what to say. "I meant... that I think we should go for more of a fun time like we did before. And, you're right; it's not like we haven't made some progress. We're a bunch of people."</p> <p>"And, now we're about to be together again." I replied as I rolled across the bed.</p> <p>"Now, now, sweetie, don't try to act like it's all that bad. We both understand, now," he responded. He reached for his coat to dress himself.</p> <p>With my dress lying on the bed, I reached for it without taking my panties off, but, instead of putting it on, I picked it up off the floor and held it out for him, smiling as he looked and nodded.</p> <p>I slid the panties on and slipped out of the bed before he could change his mind, which left us both naked again.</p> <p>"My goodness! I can't believe how good that feels, too!" He exclaimed. "I thought you never got it?"</p> <p>"Well, it's definitely not going to last long without having it." I answered honestly.</p> <p>"I was pretty sure you had it." He exclaimed.</p> <p>"Oh, I didn't! I did too!" I teased. "But, we have to leave before I can wear that outfit again."</p> <p>"No time for it," he said as he picked up his clothes and left the room.</p> <p>"Okay..." I responded. "And, if you find my costume and change, I'll change here too..." I finished my sentence.</p> <p>"Yes, please", he said as he reached for his clothes.</p> <p>"No, I'm not going anywhere. Stay here; you can change while I change." I finished his last replyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
