Jack looked up at him and I saw him flinch. "It's me."</p> <p>"Oh, and did you get my number?" I asked.</p> <p>He shook his head again and looked down. After several seconds he looked up at me.</p> <p>"I did. I saw your name on the caller ID." He took both hands back up the sheet of paper and handed it to me. "Call this number with your cell phone and get my number then meet me out there, okay?"</p> <p>"I will do it." The look in Jack's eyes said it all. I smiled to myself as I dialed the number. The phone rang with no answer. A moment later, he picked up the phone to answer and spoke for a moment.</p> <p>"Jack, it's me, I just found a friend in town that called and wanted to see you." He sounded as if he knew Jack so I thought he must have guessed that I wasn't going to be able to reach the conversation until he had left. I heard him tell the voice how he found his name and they chatted for a minute longer before getting back on the line. "See you soon."</p> <p>I made my way out of the conference room and as I approached his door, I got myself a brief, but pleasant, parting before I entered. I knocked on the door and waited for a moment. I heard the sound of a key in the lock. I stepped in and the door closed behind me. "I'm sorry, you've been waiting long enough."</p> <p>I couldn't believe what I was hearing. A few minutes before, Jack had been just talking to a very attractive male. He'd been telling me how attractive I was too, how he couldn't wait to see me when he got my number and told me he was a friend of mine. Jack was also the only man I had ever even thought I had even considered getting to know one of the many guys that we had had in the past. But here I was, thinking that he was right. "Why are you asking me for my number, Jack?"</p> <p>"Well, now that you have, I was hoping you would call me. I'm sure there are a lot of women that would love to meet you."</p> <p>"That's kind of the point, Jack. You know that I am a woman, in that I am in good shape and I won't want to do that to anybody else, especially someone as pretty as you. Now, I'm not sure if all women would want to have the chance to have their breasts looked at by a man. There have been a lot of guys that I've dated and never did."</p> <p>"You didn't seem to mind, did you?"</p> <p>"Well, I guess I was afraid that you wouldn't want to meet that man, but you don't look so sure." I couldn't believe that I sounded so flattered, that I was talking just to make sure that I wasn't taking advantage of him, but I just smiled to myself.</p> <p>"Well, that's true, but I'll be honest! I was attracted to him, you know! I was getting tired of waiting. I've been with a lot of guys that think I'm attractive but I can't seem to get enough of them."</p> <p>"But you don't look good!" Jack said. "I noticed that you were taking a lot more notice of my appearance, but you seemed more interested in that woman that I saw there."</p> <p>I stopped for a moment and tried to remember how to respond to that. Maybe I should have. I hadn't done anything wrong, just trying to put the ball on what Jack had known.</p> <p>"You remember I said that I'm not interested in another married man?"</p> <p>"Jack! Are you kidding me?"</p> <p>Jack laughed. "No, I don't think I am. Not yet anyway. Not after all I have done to you over the past few months." He paused and I continued, "You have been very respectful, and very attentive to me for as long as we have been friends."</p> <p>"Jack, that's wonderful, I know that you are good in that area. I certainly won't think it wrong to feel that way."</p> <p>"Well, you have to take your mind off me. I haven't gone out with anyone that day of the week for quite some time." Jack smiled again as he said that. "Besides, I'm going to need a lot of practice as a man. I'm not exactly a virgin either." I laughed with him. "Not really, I've tried to be a little more assertive by myself. What do you think I am? What will I do the two of you if you're going to do that?"</p> <p>Jack was not that bluntâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
