You just got to have some fun with that cock, and I hope you have good stamina."</p> <p>I grabbed the dildo and began sucking on her nipples again. I began bobbing my head up and down while I held her thighs with my hands. She was in a constant state of trembling and her pussy oozed copiously. I had to make her cum, but I was going to try. I lifted her thighs and brought her feet into the air on my arms. I put her calves over my shoulders so that my dick was now level with her snatch, while simultaneously I ran the head down over her pussy lips and back over her clit. I held on, and with a final moan, sent a stream of my jism in her vagina. When it was finally all spent and my cock popped out, she smiled at me and rolled her beautiful body off me. We lay there until her breathing had calmed down and she got up, turned around and bent down until her lips met mine. We kissed long and soft, but very intense. I reached down and began stroking her soft, warm tummy as I returned the attention.</p> <p>"That was terrific," I said.</p> <p>"Yes. That's what I was looking for, wasn't it?"</p> <p>"I certainly hope so, because I'll probably suck your cock again soon."</p> <p>"Oh yes, you will," she said. "But you have to get back to the bedroom before you go insane."</p> <p>"That's a deal."</p> <p>I made sure the coast was clear and made a beeline for the shower. Once in the shower, I immediately began stroking my pecker again.</p> <p>"Did anything happen while you were doing that?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yeah. I've only fucked some, but I had this intense orgasm just as your mother suggested."</p> <p>"You're right."</p> <p>"Do you have any more questions?"</p> <p>"Okay," I said, "but I have to get home."</p> <p>"So did I." With that, we stood up and turned off the warm shower. I went to my room that night, and slept like a baby.</p> <p>When I got back it was Monday morning. I got into bed as usual, and she was still asleep from our incredible lovemaking. I turned back to her and smiled, hoping for some answers.</p> <p>"Well then," she said. That smile again. "You haven't done anything yet . . . have you?"</p> <p>"No," I lied. "Nothing you're doing won't be anything I haven't done."</p> <p>"Well," she said. "It wasn't all that much fun to watch you fuck your sister was it?"</p> <p>"Well, actually, it was quite a bit of fun," I said as I began gently stroking her leg. "It was kind of humiliating and a lot of fun. But I don't remember it exactly. It was my sister who was with you."</p> <p>"That's not how it works, is it?" she replied. "You have to remember to keep everything personal and professional. That's it for now, though." I had no desire to tell her how much I had enjoyed it, but I was certainly sure it took her by surprise. We held each other close and kissed again and then we rolled onto our sides and began spooning.</p> <p>"Do you hate me?" she said softly.</p> <p>"Of course not."</p> <p>"Then why does it take so long?"</p> <p>"I wish I could tell you, but that would be like telling anyone else."</p> <p>"Tell me about your sister, but maybe we shouldn't just tell your brother?"</p> <p>"Why not?" I said. "He's just a guy. And besides, you're a girl. What do you think I'm going to do to him now?"</p> <p>"Well, I'm not sure exactly what I'd do with him," she said. "I might ask him to come over to my bed for something. That might be a good time." I was still lying with my arms around her, so I began to stroke her. "I don't know, really. But I guess that's what it'd be like if you did it with another guy. Besides, you're still mine."</p> <p>"You mean there's no limits?"</p> <p>"I guess there isn't."</p> <p>"But I think we have to keep each other in the family. What happens between the two of you, stays between us." I put my leg on hers and felt the end of my cock pressing up against her pussy.</p> <p>"I don't know that I'm trying," she said. "Maybe we should just make it so I'm on top."</p> <p>"So are you afraid to say 'no" to anything?"</p> <p>"Sometimes, yesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
