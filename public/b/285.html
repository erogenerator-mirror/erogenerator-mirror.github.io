He asked, and he was very polite and sweet-natured, and was a very pleasant and loving and sensitive lover, and not without reason.</p> <p>"Only two," I replied very quickly.</p> <p>"Well, since you asked, how many other men have you had? I'll be there. I'll be watching, so to speak." I wasn't sure how he was feeling about me watching other men, because it seemed to be something he liked and did to me, and if he thought the look on my face was a look of arousal, he couldn't be the cause.</p> <p>"I'll always be your husband." I said in a serious voice. "But I've got a husband of mine whom I'm not sure would appreciate me being so close to a man, and would rather not watch." I meant it. The man was clearly happy he wasn't the cause of my arousal.</p> <p>"That's a very thoughtful answer, but it isn't fair of me to expect that you even know what goes on in the world. If you were to just watch, I will certainly be jealous." I felt a little more comfortable with that. We laughed and talked for a while, and then, the evening began again. I was getting very aroused by this time, and was starting to doze. This was one hot and erotic evening, and was a treat even I hadn't experienced by anyone before.</p> <p>Dinner really was interesting. The food was good, we liked each other, we were all very well taken care of, we were all very pleasant and loving and fun. As the evening wore on, he got a little drunk and began to get pretty slippy. I helped him out with it, and by midnight, he became the center of my attention again. A little later, I decided that I wanted a bit more light and flirty, and I got him a glass of wine, and he sat with me for a while as we drank. We talked a lot about sex, we laughed and played, and he even got up and went into the bathroom to clean himself up, and he came back out with the robe on, and the bottle of very expensive perfume in his hand. I couldn't really fault him for that, and I thought I could have gone for a run for a while to get that off him, but I just went to sleep and went right to my husband's bathroom so I could take a shower.</p> <p>I woke up early, and as I poured myself another glass of wine, I felt rather horny as I was. I took a deep breath in to freshen up my hair so that it looked very fresh and smelled of lilacs (as some of those perfume were made specifically for winter at this point), and then I went to the bathroom, not bothering to pull the door shut, because I was feeling very sexual, and I was getting that horny feeling again. I got into the shower and took care of my hair, and then when I got out, I stepped into the bedroom and went to bed.</p> <p>I was very horny by that time, and wanted sex. I tried to get one or two hard orgasms, but with my husband's drunkness, the alcohol, and the wine, I probably couldn't give at all. After some more wine, the mood shifted and our sex became much more interesting. I was getting close, but he just had to stop me from doing something, and I stopped myself and just went to sleep.</p> <p>A couple of days passed, and I got a call from Gary saying that the guy's hotel was booked solid, and asked about the price range. They had a really expensive suite, and they said that it had a lot of very nice amenities. They had a room nearby, and I told him to give me a minute on the phone before he hung up. I went into the bathroom and took off my robe, and I was just naked as I walked into the bathroom. He looked me over from head to toe, and I liked that.</p> <p>"You are so beautiful," he said. "And incredibly sexy looking too. You're very pretty, and you're not like the other girls that I meet. It's just hard to say. Do you have one?"</p> <p>"No," I replied. "But I'm not sure that anyone has ever told me that before. No one has. It's really all about whether or not someone gets a good time."</p> <p>"It's not so bad, if you like it," he said. "You're very sexy. I would love to meet you."</p> <p>I took a deep breath and let it out slowly. "I'm not sure about that. I guess we'll meet, but I'll never tell."</p> <p>"No, you'll never tell?"</p> <p>"I guessâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
