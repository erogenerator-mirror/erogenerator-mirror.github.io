Here's the card I bought you, please call me." The man held the card back and held on to it as she went up the street.</p> <p>"I'll come get you" she called over her shoulder, as she walked towards her car.</p> <p>"I'll call you" he called back as he pulled his shorts back on.</p> <p>"Yes ... that would be ..." he said pulling up his shorts.</p> <p>It turned out that she called him. He picked his face back up where it had been and put his finger under the card, looking closely. He could see that she was smiling for a minute. He said,</p> <p>"I'll keep it." Then he grabbed her arm and they started to walk away.</p> <p>"I wish you'd give me another dance ... maybe then you know we can spend the night together." he said.</p> <p>"I have a better idea", she said, turning her face to his. He saw her grin again and he thought that she could melt into him. She leaned into him and he felt her cheek against his chest. He pulled her against him and felt his heart start to beat faster as he hugged her tight. He could feel her hips rubbing firmly against him and she felt his cock swell even more.</p> <p>When they had pulled away, they walked inside so quickly that they made a little noise. She saw that her hand had found his and was pulling him towards her.</p> <p>"We can do that again." she said softly.</p> <p>"What do you mean?" he asked.</p> <p>"I mean ... this time, I want to feel you again." she said.</p> <p>"I'd love that" he said, sliding his hand down her back and pushing on her thigh.</p> <p>"Let me see you" she said and he slid them into her car. He watched her as she turned the key and backed out of the parking lot.</p> <p>She was still smiling when they reached her condo when she saw two lights in the parking lot of her building.</p> <p>"I can't believe it!", she said as she held his car door open. She stood up and then stood on her tiptoes to kiss him. Her arms went around his neck and they kissed for what seemed a long time.</p> <p>"Let's go into the lobby," she said after they broke the kiss. He stood.</p> <p>"Let me ... get a couple of things." she said and he started to back away, so she took his hand and headed toward the lobby. He followed her as she hurriedly went to get a couple of items for them. He followed her, feeling all the way, until she turned right into a stairway that led to the second floor. He followed her through the doorway into the hallway. "I know your condo was a little short" she said as she reached the stairs.</p> <p>She led him up to her second floor room and turned around.</p> <p>"I can't believe we're actually doing it." she said as she smiled. They entered her bedroom, and he closed the door, while she opened her closet. She was standing in front of her dresser by the mirror.</p> <p>"I bought this dress, as well" she said.</p> <p>"How about we take our time? You look great."</p> <p>"I'm thinking I can't take our time anymore", she replied, but she turned and began to undress, taking off her bra. She stood there, with just the light from the dress sticking up in her face.</p> <p>"How do I look?" she asked.</p> <p>He was watching her from the hallway closet door.</p> <p>"How do you feel?"</p> <p>"I feel like I might have sex with you in a car, but just walking in. It would be so exciting if I could ... I don't know ... if you feel anything like that." she replied.</p> <p>"That's a good question" he replied.</p> <p>"Maybe you can have me again."</p> <p>"I've been having sex with your mom ... in your mom's bed ... tonight. I can't say I'm surprised. This evening has been really kind of special."</p> <p>"You are too."</p> <p>When they finished undressing, she led him into the bathroom and turned up the shower.</p> <p>"The glass is really nice" she said as she adjusted the spray. "We can make love a bit if you like."</p> <p>"If you know what I mean." he said with a grin then.</p> <p>She turned the water off and turned the temperature of the water. They stood facing each other. She took his hands in hers and helped him step into the shower. She started to wash his shoulders and neck with her soapy fingers.
