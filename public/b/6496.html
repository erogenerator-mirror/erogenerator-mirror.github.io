He said. I looked at him, surprised, but excited, and took a step closer.</p> <p>"Let's go into the bedroom shall we." He said, and we slowly made our way upstairs. We passed by a side door, lit by the light of a street lamp, and climbed the short flight of stairs. He turned to look at me, but I was already there. He was sitting on the end of the bed, watching me.</p> <p>"Do you mind?" I asked.</p> <p>"It's okay." He said.</p> <p>"Did you get a real treat at the mall this morning?" I asked.</p> <p>He didn't answer.</p> <p>"Just watch." He said, as if I would hear him. I felt my body's response to him, and couldn't believe I was doing this. I took a step back and looked down at him. He was staring at my breasts, at my smooth pussy. His cock, which had gone completely erect, stood out hard and straight. I took another step back. I wanted to feel it inside me. And I knew I had to. I took another step back, and stopped, and looked at his cock. He was hard as a rock, almost ready for me. I felt my pussy get wet. He reached down and put his hand on top of my head. His hand felt warm, and soft. His fingers were cool; not cold like I thought. He slowly rubbed his hand over my skin. I moved my hands until I touched his cock, only the head. He didn't say a word. His breathing became louder.</p> <p>"Do you want to?" I said. He still didn't respond. I looked down, and saw that my hands had already moved away from his cock. It was standing at attention. I took him in my hand again. I slowly raised his cock so it hit the back of my hand. I felt his reaction all over again. He moaned. He was a good deal bigger than the first time I had touched him. I moved his cock up and put it at the opening of my opening. I slid it inside. I was wet, and his cock was so hard.</p> <p>"Now, fuck me as hard as you can, cowboy." I whispered to him. His eyes were closed and his head was tilted up to see my reaction. I felt him getting harder inside me. I kept moving his cock in and out of me, slowly at first. My other hand moved toward the wall of the bed. I slid my hands over my ass and up my back, to my breasts.</p> <p>"I'm going to fuck you real good." I said, as a warning. I was getting ready to slide it all the way inside me, and didn't let go. I continued thrusting it in and out, slowly at first. Then I got faster. Soon, he wasn't fucking me, his movements became more frenzied and frantic. His movements were as fast as they could be. "Ah shit." I thought to myself "This is the one that'll make me cum before the night is through." I thought about how hard I was riding his cock. He was so big. So hard. So deep.</p> <p>"Fuck me" I screamed in a voice that sounded like nothing. "Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me" as my body spasmed in pleasure. His thrusts became more frantic. I knew he was getting close. "I'm close" he yelled as I saw his cock expand and explode inside of me and shot cum inside me. There in front of me, his cock spurted out more and more man juices that coated my pussy. I felt it go in, and it spread around my body. I felt my pussy lips touch his cock as he erupted from the force of his orgasm. We lay there on the bed, holding each other. After a minute I rolled off of him, his cock still semi hard. We kissed a quick time, after each of orgasms. We kissed some more, and got up to go to the bathroom.</p> <p>I turned on the shower, and we quickly got in. I got him off of me, in an act of mutual lovemaking. We washed each other. He took a wash cloth from a shelf and washed my long hair, while I was washing him. Once I was satisfied we were clean enough, I dried him off, and helped him get into bed. We climbed in and spooned. I loved having him in me; I couldn't get enough of him. He was always touching me in the way that I loved him touching me.</p> <p>Our sex life was only the regular thing. We had tried all kinds of sex. We just never came close to the same way. A kiss on the cheek might be fun, or maybe not.
