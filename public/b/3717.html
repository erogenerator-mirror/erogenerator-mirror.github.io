The more I've been to the club the more my friends have come to watch the girl get fucked.</p> <p>The way I see it, the women and men have to love for the girls. It's the sex. If not, then who in the hell's it to love it?</p> <p>So, how's the story going? Do you want to get back to fucking like rabbits?</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>"Damn him, that feels so good," Katie said again. "Yes, I'm really loving this."</p> <p>Bella sat naked on the bed beside her. She turned to Bella.</p> <p>"Don't move," Bella said.</p> <p>Bella looked over at Emma's sleeping face and the pink tongue poking out from between her legs. This was a woman, right?</p> <p>"I think this may not have a name. Bella?"</p> <p>"Yes?" Bella asked.</p> <p>"It's all for you?" Emma asked.</p> <p>"You heard, Bella," Bella said.</p> <p>Bella turned to look at the man, and she saw it. The man was a short, wiry, blue-eyed, dark haired man. He carried himself with a hard angular face that looked as if it might be the first of any man's, and it certainly wasn't. He had to be forty three or forty eight.</p> <p></p> <p>Bella had never felt so frightened, so embarrassed.</p> <p></p> <p>"You're fucking him," Emma said. "It's all very well, if you do all that with the girl," Emma went on. "Just get those eyes open, and let's get to know each other."</p> <p>Bella looked away, ashamed.</p> <p>Emma saw the fear in the girl's eyes, and her heart started beating faster.</p> <p></p> <p>"I can't," Bella said. "I'm not his girlfriend, I'm a girl."</p> <p>"So, you're on that 'girlfriend' list you said, I guess," Emma said.</p> <p>Bella did not answer.</p> <p>"I mean, he knows I'm all girl, and it's kind of nice," Emma said with a shrug.</p> <p>Bella felt weak. She wanted to say something, but she could not bring herself to say it. "I shouldn't." Bella told Emma.</p> <p></p> <p>There was a knock at the door.</p> <p>"Bella? Are you there?" A male voice called.</p> <p>Bella got up. She went to the door of the apartment to answer it. That's right, it was the guy's apartment.</p> <p>He was standing at the door.</p> <p>"Hello, I'm the guy from last night," Joe said.</p> <p>"Hi, Joe. What's on the menu?" Joe saw the girl. "Yeah, what's in the package?"</p> <p>"That's a lovely dress."</p> <p>Oh, right. That dress is going to be the one, and that dress should still be on the menu."</p> <p></p> <p>He turned to face the other man.</p> <p>"I'd like to put it in the envelope," Joe said.</p> <p>"But, we are not here for the sex," Joe said.</p> <p>The man nodded, and then pointed to the envelope beside him.</p> <p>"What's this?"</p> <p>"The envelope," Joe said. "I want that picture for the birthday ball. I've a date that the girl, I mean her, has to go to."</p> <p>"No, she can't. That's not good enough for her, because he says that he can't do it."</p> <p>"She has to do it?" Joe asked.</p> <p>"She really does have to." Joe got this. He was hoping that this little bit of information would have some impact on the way the man made his entrance. It was important to him.</p> <p>Bella looked at the man's hard body. She could sense the hunger in his eyes too.</p> <p>The man sat back down. He took the envelope. "Now, I want to get my first set of pictures," Joe said.</p> <p>She took the pictures and held them up to him.</p> <p>"They're all great, I'm sure." He looked into her eyes. "Now, where were we?" Joe put the envelope back on the table.</p> <p>"I think I was supposed to sit right here." She gestured to the front of the woman's dress. "Is this what you want?"</p> <p></p> <p>He looked at the woman's face. "I hope that this is what you wantâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
