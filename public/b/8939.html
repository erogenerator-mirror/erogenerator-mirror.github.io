I think that you'll like me anyway." He had already slipped off his boots and had them back on.</p> <p>"Well, I suppose I can make an exception. I'll go down and pick up a box of chocolates."</p> <p>"Okay, go."</p> <p>Tommy and the waitress came back. Tommy looked at me and smiled. His hand came up to cup my face and pull it. After a few seconds, he squeezed a little harder.</p> <p>"That will be all," he said firmly. His hands moved to the back of my neck again. My head was still bent in an arc, his lips now kissing the top of my head. My pulse quickened at his touch. His hand was moving to the neck that was just above my collar bones, just below my cleavage. I felt him tug on my collarbone with his fingers. I leaned up slightly to meet him. The kiss had a lot in common with mine. His lips moved further down to the small of my neck, my ears. He pressed his lips there just seconds before taking the lobe in and sucking. I gasped. Then we were both kissing.</p> <p>Tommy's hands were on my back, running down my shoulders when I reached up to pull his lips back to my ear.</p> <p>"There's always time," I whispered. "If you want to do that, we can do that."</p> <p>Tommy's hands were on my ass, his fingers playing with the zipper down the back of my dress. The material was very thin, I wasn't sure if there would be anywhere beneath it to go on my lower back.</p> <p>I had no desire or desire to be in the way of a kiss, I just didn't want to break it, so to speak. But for this very special moment, I didn't know what it took. My lips were tingling as we kissed, as my breathing grew uneven.</p> <p>Tommy kissed his way down my neck to the collarbone that was exposed. He nipped the skin there as he lowered his mouth to the spot. I thought of the bite and knew that he had not. Tommy's right hand on my shoulder held me there for a long moment. Then it moved around to the front of my shirt. He rubbed the bare skin on my chest with two fingers. I could feel every inch of flesh in his hands, my whole body was tingling all the way through my skin.</p> <p>Tommy's mouth took my earlobe between his lips. He sucked it gently, then nibbled on it with his teeth, and I felt his warm breath on my ear.</p> <p>"My shirt," I murmured.</p> <p>"It's yours," was his response. I could tell that he wanted to take what he found at my ear and suck it. The feeling of his warm breath on my neck was so erotic, yet so terrifying.</p> <p>I let him unbutton my shirt as it went up and over my bra. My hands went down his back and back to his hair. Tommy stood up, took a hand on my hand, and lead me to the bedroom. While we made the bed, he stripped my boots, socks, and pants off. He kissed me all over and sucked all over my legs in the process. I pulled his shirt over his head and threw it on the bed.</p> <p>He pulled off his clothes and laid back on the bed, looking expectantly at me. The look in his eyes made me want to dive towards him, but I knew that I was to wait, to enjoy the moment, and to find out what he could do to me in a different way. I stood up to the edge of the bed, and ran my hands up and down his leg.</p> <p>"Do it," I whispered, kneeling over him. His body jerked with the excitement, the anticipation. I ran my hands along his torso, feeling the texture of his skin. I went down to his thighs and pushed them apart, looking for the source of his excitement.</p> <p>I stood back up again, gazing with fascination at the sight of something that I had never seen. The sight had fascinated me, as well as made me crazy. Tommy was the sexiest man I had ever seen. I knew from personal experience that he had never really been with another man before. Maybe it was his size, maybe the fact that he had been with women, maybe the fact that most men wouldn't go for that and the fact that it was just something that most of them would do. I wasn't looking to have sex, I was merely fascinated by the sight of it.</p> <p>My hands went under the hem of his turtleneck. He didn't resist, and I pulled it up. I kissed his chest, moving around the undershirt to his chin and onto his throat. I felt the muscles of his abs on my lips, my handsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
