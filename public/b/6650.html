I was still a few drinks late, so we headed up to bed with him not saying anything to me. He asked me what I had on, so I told him we couldn't let it keep our little party going...not that there wasn't room here. I wanted to get up early in case he woke up to find me laying there with a big hard on. He saw the bulge in my shorts when I turned around.</p> <p>"What's it to you?" I asked him as he walked towards me as I leaned over the bed and opened to my knees. I reached out and took it firmly in my hands pulling his shorts down to expose his beautiful hard cock to me. It sprang free and throbbed in my hands. I reached out and put an index finger on the top that runs from above his balls and over the head of his cock. He moaned a little and his cock stiffened even more. I held his cock in one hand and his cock on my hand which was still very hard and pointed straight at my face.</p> <p>"Suck" I commanded.</p> <p>He took his big member in his hand and slowly started to rub it up and down my lips which parted with a little squeal as his cock entered my mouth..his head was right in my throat and I felt his hips move a little. I was holding his cock in my hand and was pulling him towards me and he moaned at the new sensation and slipped his cock back out of my mouth. I moved and took his hand and led him to the bed. We kissed, his cock still in my hand, and I looked deep into his eyes as he kissed me hungrily.</p> <p>"Do you like it in your mouth?" he asked me.</p> <p>I nodded and then kissed him. When we were done, I laid him down on his back and his cock sprang into the air waving to me as I sat up. I looked at it once again and got up from the bed. I moved over to a chair by the desk in the other room in which he could look down and see my naked body and I sat down next to him.</p> <p>"Do you wish me to continue to please you today?" I asked while looking at his hard cock and at his beautiful facial expression.</p> <p>"Yes" he nodded his head up and down.</p> <p>"Good" I said as I leaned down and licked his balls and fluttered my hot breath over them. And then I looked into his eyes and said</p> <p>"Well then come here and take your reward."</p> <p>And with that, I straddled him, his body on his back, and guided his cock to my wet pussy. I sat down on it, as his hands went to hold my hips and as I rode down onto him I reached down and placed my fingers on his lips telling him to say his prayers. Then I sat straight up, holding his lips with mine and kissed him long and hard making his cock press into me where my hand pressed down on his lips. He kissed me back, his tongue making that "suck" motion at me that told me to fuck him harder and deeper. I rode into him faster and harder, his hands on my hips, driving the motion as I grinded against him. With long slow strokes, they moved together as I rocked and rode, I felt his head pressing on the top of my clit as his hips kept thrusting but he stayed in me, moving with me to the faster thrust and to meet me with his hips as he pumped into me with every thrust. His body was tight around me, his hands were on my hips, his face was pressed against mine with the look on his face showing how much he loved me for what we were doing to him. I felt that intense thrill of knowing I gave him pleasure as I kept up the motion of our fucking.</p> <p>My hands were on his chest and he was laying there, kissing me as he felt my body, our bodies intertwined with passion.</p> <p>"I'm gonna cum!" he whispered. I just kept riding up and down on him, our bodies gliding together as I felt so connected to the person inside of me.</p> <p>He wrapped his arms around me around my body and I pressed against him as he held my face to his for a moment.</p> <p>"Do it, cum with me" so he wrapped his arms again around his body and we lay there motionless as we both continued to cum with each breath.</p> <p>When we had calmed back down a bit, he moved up to lie on his back while I turned on my side to kiss him. We lay there kissingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
