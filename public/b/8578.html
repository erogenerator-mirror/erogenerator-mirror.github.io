"You look absolutely stunning, you really do." I had no idea how to describe what was happening.</p> <p>"Thank you," she said, still not saying a word. When she finally got herself together, she looked at me like I just had a heart attack in reverse-ta-tas. She took three steps toward me, put one hand on my hip and gave me a peck on the cheek. She looked at the room. "It's nice. I've been thinking about you for the months I've been sleeping in your suite." The room was dark and I could just make out her silhouette in the candlelight. She kissed the tip of my nose while running her fingers through my short brown hair. "Let's go to bed," she said, still gazing at me.</p> <p>I looked back through the slits of my eyes and saw only one thing in the dark room. My little threesome was going to start right here. My body was ready, and she had made it!</p> <p>I turned around, and my little minx grabbed the hem of my skirt and slowly raised it. She slid my white cotton panties, along with my silk hose, between her teeth and swallowed them. She slid them off me and took hold of my panties in her hands and ripped them off me completely. I was trembling from her power.</p> <p>She looked up at me with a grin. "Come on. Let's see if I can do this again." She grabbed my bra, and pulled it off, tossing it onto the bed. I stepped out of my panties and she tossed them onto the bed too. She took off her clothes as she kissed my hand, her lips, and my fingers. She kissed my palm and kissed my other, letting her tongue explore my knuckle.</p> <p>She broke away and grabbed her nightgown off the other side of the bed. I watched hungrily as she started to unbutton her blouse. All at once she was naked, her dark nipples hard. Next came her bra. I stared in wonder as her large breasts flopped out of her clothes. They were beautiful, but she didn't seem to like my eyes looking at her either. Her breasts were perfect, small and round.</p> <p>"Do them," she ordered. I pulled her by her right nipple and she let out a small gasp.</p> <p>"Touch them," she said looking at me with half-closed eyes. I reached over to the nightstand and retrieved a condom. I opened the box and saw my clothes; I guess they were still lying there.</p> <p>"Condoms?" I asked, amazed. "Of course." I handed her the box. "What condom do you use?"</p> <p>She reached out and grabbed one. "Well, I usually use a little KY, and a little, um, I guess. . ." Her voice trailed off. Her voice tapered off to that of pleasure, which was a pleasure to me. I took the condom from her hand and she turned around, reaching with both hands for my pussy. Her hands were so light, and I got a thrill from holding her hands. She put them in the right places and gently massaged my lips and clit. She made slow circles. "So, did your first time really feel good?"</p> <p>"It felt fantastic." I looked up at my best friend and nodded.</p> <p>"Good," she said as she lowered herself onto my face, rubbing her clit on my lips. With her other hand I reached through her legs and felt for her pussy. "Don't just lick!" she barked. I obliged. She grabbed my thighs and slowly moved herself around on me. At first she was riding me like a horse, and I couldn't have taken much more of it. Eventually she leaned back and I had a clear view between the cheeks of her ass. I moved behind her and rubbed my head up and down across her asshole, which looked delicious.</p> <p>She let out a little yell, and I pressed myself up against her. She felt just the slightest bit like I thought she should feel. It was nice, though, after watching her and thinking about just making love to each other for a week. It felt a little strange at first, like her hands were all over me, but soon I felt more than a little of her own sexuality stirring again. I moved into her ass.</p> <p>"Oh my, you're really tight there!" I was a little surprised at the thought, or to be honest, at how much she had a crush on me. When she was in an ass-up I'd usually use my fingers to rub her clitoris. Or I could get her to do my thing. So I kept going.</p> <p>"That's so sexy! I'm so happy you're doing this!" She was rocking from side to side onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
