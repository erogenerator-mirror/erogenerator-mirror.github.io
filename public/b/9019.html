"Now it's time for the main course!" she said as she straddled me, lowering my already stiff penis down into her vagina at just the right angle to take me in.</p> <p>"Ummmmm, ohhhh gaaawwwwdd!" she moaned as she slid her body down on me, my stiff penis penetrating her as she took me in.</p> <p>My penis slid further in on this first time fuck, feeling my wife's soft pussy squeezing her vagina walls around me. I couldn't believe the feeling of her sex muscles gripping me so tightly. I could barely move my hips up and down as she rocked back and forth on me. I put one hand behind her and squeezed her breast with the other hand.</p> <p>"I guess we're into first time sex now," I said into the silence as I played with her titties and nipples.</p> <p>We continued to make out as my penis slid in and out of her wet vagina, the sound loudest and most stimulating. She started to rock her body all over and it felt like we had intercourse right there and then. Her vagina had an incredible grip on my penis as it slid in and out of it.</p> <p>I could feel the pressure building in my dick as my own orgasm neared. This woman was incredible.</p> <p>"I'm getting close!" I panted as I thrust harder and faster up into her.</p> <p>"Gaaawdd," she moaned. "Come with me!"</p> <p>As it struck, I cried out as my dick began to pump a huge load of semen up into her belly. She began to rock her crotch on me again and I felt a rush of pressure and warmth as I emptied myself inside her.</p> <p>Suddenly it was over and we were free to talk again.</p> <p>"Oh my god!" she said as I felt my penis soften inside her. "That is the best sex I've ever had!" I said. "That was wonderful!"</p> <p>We held onto each other as we recovered and then lay on the bed afterwards. We talked about what just happened and I said, "I don't know, I'm a little sore."</p> <p>"Well, I think we can fix that," she said as she got up and got some tissues.</p> <p>She wiped off my penis, then got me a towel and we cleaned up our pussies.</p> <p>I got up and got dressed as I had earlier in the evening, and we said good night and went down to the living room to eat dinner and watch a movie. We cuddled up on the sofa and fell asleep, with me spooning her, my hand on her breast.</p> <p>We both woke up about 1 o'clock the next morning, but went straight to the bathroom to brush our teeth then went to shower and wash our hair.</p> <p>When we returned, we put on our robes and went to the kitchen where we took a bottle of wine into the living room to eat. Once we had finished and finished the meal, we sat down at the dining table and I got us some appetizers and brought them over to the table. We ate at the table in front of the sofa, both sipping our wine and talking. We finished our wine and I put the table napkin back into the drawer, then we sat down to eat our appetizers.</p> <p>The conversation continued and we found out that I had been married 25 years and she was 35. We talked about where we grew up growing up, and what was in our past and what they like to do now.</p> <p>Finally, her wine glass was empty, she asked "so you think that you've made a little progress with your marriage?" I said that we had had a lot of changes in our lives since I was gone, and that we were going to be pretty successful in our careers. That kind of surprised her. I agreed with her and we discussed and got very involved with our careers. She agreed to keep an eye on it and that it would be good to make sure that we were doing much better in our lives. She thought we had a lot of fun and I think that by then there was enough for her to really enjoy herself.</p> <p>After talking and getting some more wine, she had a vision of me naked and playing with myself. "Come on, do me one thing," she said.</p> <p>I said, "Sure, just get naked!"</p> <p>She said, "It's been awhile."</p> <p>I said, "Okay."</p> <p>She got up and got the panties out of the drawer she had opened earlier and slid them on. "I feel kind of dirty here," she said.</p> <p>I could only be honest about that but I was trying to be honest about how I felt and I didn't want to screw up something good.</p> <p>"I feelâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
