I could feel its hardness in her hand as her thumb rubbed my frenulum.</p> <p>"What do you like? Have you ever thought about doing this to me? Don't tell me, no one at the office has ever told you anything, you might as well tell me,"</p> <p>"I guess it's OK if you do."</p> <p>"You can touch me any way you like, but that's all you can do with your fingers, and you have to ask me where to - "</p> <p>"Right here, let me make the 'suck it up please' as she had called it, just so I know how to do it," I got out from behind the desk as she knelt down and pulled her to her knees. As she leant forward she undid the top button on my trousers. She unzipped the zip in the back of my trousers. I felt the hot breath of her as she pulled my trousers and underpants down to my feet. Then she pulled my briefs off too, and my cock stood at it's full height.</p> <p>She was still sitting on the edge of the desk when she started to run her tongue over my shaft, and she put both hands around it, she stroked me. I opened her robe and reached out to touch her naked breasts. This felt good and I cupped her breasts. I gently caressed the erect nipples with the palm of my hand, she moaned. I turned her round to face me, and we stood, I put the robe in one of the pockets. I bent over her and kissed her, and she pulled my t-shirt up.</p> <p>We kissed again, and she reached behind herself for me and unfastened the buttons of my fly. She pulled it free, and I stepped out of it too, we stood up again but on the floor. She pulled off my t-shirt and started to kiss and rub my chest. With my trousers off I kicked away her bra and we embraced again, she turned to lie on her back and I knelt on one side, I took off the rest of her clothes and moved down to join her. She was already naked, and I could see the red lipstick marks from her teeth. As I rubbed her pussy she pulled my hand to her breast again, I slipped two fingers into her.</p> <p>One of my hands moved down to her pussy, and I started to finger her while I continued my ministrations. She let her legs fall apart and as my thumb found the rough stubs of her clitoris I felt its soft, warm surface, my fingers were rubbing against it, and my cock was rubbing against her leg also where I was finger fucking her. She leaned on her elbow and started to suck on my neck. We went on like this for some moments more; when I pushed her legs even further apart, she raised them to give my mouth even better access to her clitoris. I was concentrating so much though that I had taken my finger out of her pussy when I felt it was time to move onto my cock. I pulled up the foreskin back and got it down her cunt with my free hand, then I took my cock into my hand and positioned it as she had done to me.</p> <p>She started to moan. I started to stroke in and out, I was aware of her wet mouth on my cock; when she began to rub her clitoris faster and harder, I pushed my thumb into her as far as I could, feeling the wetness around my fingers as her body went into convulsions. Her body started to shake but she kept me close to her, and she looked into my eyes and smiled. Our eyes met briefly and they locked for a few moments before she looked towards me. Again I looked closely at her face and it was clear that she was just as happy as ever. She smiled again, and I felt as if I was the only male on the planet. I felt as if my climax was ready to erupt, I was close to cumming myself, but as soon as I had time to think it over I withdrew from her. Her legs slid back further apart and she turned to me. For one last quick glance, she pushed herself back up to meet me, as she kissed me she said,</p> <p>"I like making love to you; I like to make you feel good, is that OK?"</p> <p>"Oh, that was just a start, I'm ready to try more."</p> <p>"But I don't want to, not now."</p> <p>"OK."</p> <p>I turned her around and stood over her. "This is really good and it's only our second time, right?"</p> <p>She nodded and asked, "Can you go a long time?"</p> <p>"I'll get there, but it might be worth it," I picked up my cock and I wantedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
