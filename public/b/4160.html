He took the stairs two at a time. He looked up each time so far; he had the same thought as the day before. He walked briskly up the stairs. He knew he had to catch his breath before he got off the highway, he wasn't about to just throw up; he wasn't about to let her go in the middle of the night. He was not about to turn off the highway.</p> <p>The night was long and he remembered the last time he had fallen asleep in the darkness of his bedroom. The next morning, he had awoke a little while before sunrise. His body felt asleep but was still warm; he got up quietly and left his house, leaving the road the same way he had come, and driving to the first bedroom that he saw just after sunrise, he entered the dimly lit room he was in. He was just in time to make his way across the hall and into the bedroom where his body had been the night before. He found all the clothing and toiletries in the laundry bin, and turned his body so he could retrieve the last items. The mattress wasn't there and he couldn't find his shoes. His pants hadn't been put on and he quickly changed from his shirt into something simple and comfortable. He returned to the bedroom to find his clothes scattered around the room and his clothes were neatly tucked away, there were a few tissues left from the night before in his pocket. He was a basket case in the middle of the bed, the door was shut and he knew there was a note left from his mother about how she had been a very bad girl, but there had been no crying; just a note left from her. He felt like he had lost everything except his family and the home that he had built years ago. He opened the note that had been left for him and quickly opened the envelope. What she had said this morning about 'fucking was a lot more convincing than she was willing to go for'. Inside of which, a little smiley face, a folded piece of folded tissue, one small envelope and a wad of cash. The notes had been signed, not written, and only a little writing note. It was only a half dollar note, he had to know what it was from her. He started to get dressed, he didn't want to risk her coming too soon or getting his hopes up. He didn't have time to get dressed and put on his clothes; he just started getting ready. He had to wear something of his own and he had to figure it out before she was left unfulfilled and unhappy with his lack of attention. He had to figure out what he wanted this time. It had to be something like a trip to the bathroom.</p> <p>He had gone first, got into his own shower and got dressed then took a seat in front of the TV. It was a Saturday morning and the last thing he wanted to watch was sleep. As he waited at home for the bus to drive in around one, he was hoping she would come home. He couldn't shake it, he was so anxious that he was shaking like a leaf and didn't care how long it would be before someone heard him sobbing in the night. It was an odd experience to be in the same room with the woman he loved, yet at the same time, it was like he was a stranger and he was trying to make it with a woman that he loved, who was in his room with him; who wouldn't leave him alone. He had been trying to be a gentleman and give her a chance to be by herself, since, after what she had gotten him, he had been too weak to say anymore.</p> <p>She had walked him down to the bus that he had come home from and stood next to him. She had asked what he was doing, and he answered that he was just trying to make it out that he was with an old friend. Then she leaned in and took his face in her hands, and kissed him, just a kiss that he could feel and smell of what was between her legs just a few feet away. He leaned in and kissed her back passionately, but she pulled away, and looked into his eyes as she pulled away from him. They stood there for a moment, just watching each other, just looking one another in the eyes. She looked so sexy to him, and the look on her face almost made love, he could look into those eyes and see love, if not love.</p> <p>When it was time for her bus to show up he took the seat as she had asked, and sat down, still looking into her eyes. He was so glad to be home and at peace. It wasn't the first time he had thought about what he had done and what he may now do withâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
