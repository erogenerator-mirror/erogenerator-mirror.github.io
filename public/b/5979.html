There were tables set up. As they started to take their coffee cups in, the other men came in and filled the places on one of them. I asked if they wanted to buy us another drink. They said that they would rather go outside.</p> <p>"We are just out of here now," I said to Jessica and she said, "Let me buy you a drink and see if I can get the check out for our second one."</p> <p>When we got back to the car I asked her to pay the check and put the check in her hand.</p> <p>"What is it?" she asked as she took the check from my hand. "Can we go back to my place and stay for a few more hours? Please?"</p> <p>I looked at her and asked her, "Did you have fun?"</p> <p>"Yes, I have!" she said. "Oh, and don't you feel the same." Her face was flushed.</p> <p>As we walked back to the car I realized that there would be no back way in the car this time.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>We parked and walked over to the motel. No one was there so we had a change of clothes.</p> <p>The drive to our room was a little uncomfortable but not nearly as uncomfortable as walking with her in the nude.</p> <p>The room was a suite. I took a couple of pictures and then we went to our separate bathrooms.</p> <p>As I pulled on my running shorts we went to the bedroom to dress in the clothes I had laid out on the bed.</p> <p>We entered the bedroom and she turned to me and said, "Would you like your clothes off?" as she unbuttoned her blouse.</p> <p>"Yes, I would like to change into something a little more sexy. Would you prefer I wear something like a bra and panties?"</p> <p>"I've thought of little else than the two of us undressing in front of each other. Do I turn you on?"</p> <p>She blushed and smiled.</p> <p>"You turn me on!" she giggled.</p> <p>We walked into the bedroom, undressed, and went back out onto the balcony. I watched the lights go on as we sat on one of the sofas and she sat on the other one. I got her blouse out and removed her bra with my right arm. When I was done she asked if I would like to take it off. I leaned over and untied it, undid it, and laid it on a chair in the corner.</p> <p>I took off my wet panties and put them in the hamper.</p> <p>Jessica and I watched the lights go on for a few moments as we sat there naked except for our socks. I reached under my skirt and touched her bare pussy. She gasped.</p> <p>My hands were covered in her lubricating juices when I got down on my hands and knees and began licking her thighs.</p> <p>"Oh my," she squealed. "What are you doing, sweetheart? Oh, you are marvelous!"</p> <p>I smiled and kissed her inner thighs and worked my way to her pussy.</p> <p>"What are you doing," she asked.</p> <p>I pulled her legs up over my shoulders and my tongue went deep into her vagina.</p> <p>"Hmmm, just do what you were doing," she said. "Suck my clit! I want you on top!"</p> <p>I began licking her clit. She was moaning, groaning, and her body began to shudder as her first orgasm shook her. She screamed; "Oh my god, yes yes! I'm cumming. Eat my pussy!"</p> <p>My tongue was still out as my hands were massaging her breasts the way she liked them.</p> <p>All of a sudden she stood up and said, "Put your cock inside me."</p> <p>I pushed her legs up over my head and took my cock in my hand.</p> <p>I guided my head to her vagina and slid my cock head between her labia and in her vagina. Both of us groaned as my cock filled her vagina completely.</p> <p>When I was in her a couple of inches went in her, as her body began to roll around. I got the head of my cock into her and began to move it in and out.</p> <p>Her body was moving with me. I leaned over and kissed her.</p> <p>I began to move my ass as we ground our bodies. Her legs wrapped around my lower back. It was really erotic.</p> <p>"Oh my god, I feel full," she whispered.</p> <p>I moved my cock in her until it was almost out. Then I moved my cock back in her. I was in her again for the firstâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
