He added, and kissed me deeply.</p> <p>"Good." I smiled feeling his body shift closer to mine.</p> <p>He wrapped his arms around me and gave me more kisses. I didn't resist. I leaned my head back against the side wall of my closet and enjoyed his exploration. I had no qualms about what we were doing. No regrets. We were making love.</p> <p>I started making short gentle thrusts against his penis and feeling it harden inside me. His hands slid down along my side as a sign of what he was doing. I loved what he was doing for me. He knew exactly what he was doing for me. He wasn't in the right mindset to tease me beyond the teasing and need so that I came over and over again. We were making love on my bed. Our bodies against each other and the passion that was running through our bodies began to build deep and slow. He was just taking me and I was going with him.</p> <p>My hands started stroking his arms. It was not what he was used too but I loved the feel of it. I had seen his arms in his gym shorts. They were longer. His chest hair was slightly darker. He had dark circles under his eyes. He was handsome beyond his age. I had never seen such a beautiful face.</p> <p>He started to kiss me, and I started to respond in kind. Our kiss was urgent but he didn't want to hurry. I was a bit on the tip of his tongue. Not yet. He wrapped both arms around me and we explored each other's body with our hands, while exploring for his heart. There wasn't ever anything like kissing him.</p> <p>He moved off me and started to undo the buttons on his shirt. Before his shirt could come off, he had undressed himself. I looked into his eyes and saw love and adoration in them.</p> <p>"I've wanted you all evening." I whispered in a tone that sounded like it was his cue. We stood in the closet kissing. I had a little more patience though then he had. It was time to take the leap to the next step. I took his hand and led him into the bathroom. We stood in the bathroom for a few minutes; feeling the water on our bodies. He undressed and I took my time with him. I removed his shirt and he followed suit. We turned the shower on and I stepped inside. He put both his arms around my back and we kissed again. He ran his hands along my sides as we kissed. Our pelvis's touched as we rubbed our hands together.</p> <p>I was beginning to think that everything was a little forward, and we couldn't be a couple. I wanted to be in his arms.</p> <p>"Turn around." I whispered in his ear as I started to take off my shirt.</p> <p>He began to undress himself from the waist up. I was naked now. His eyes were watching in fascination as he started to unbutton his shirt. Then, with no hesitation, he unbuttoned the front of his jeans. I had a smile on my face when he slipped his panties off. He reached into his wallet for the condom, which, I had brought back. It was in his wallet.</p> <p>"Here." I said as I handed him the condom. He grabbed my hand and helped me stand up. He laid me down and I had a wonderful time running my hands along his body. He moved down so his mouth was touching my breasts and then his body was between my legs. His penis was sticking up in the air as he went to work on me, kissing and licking along my slit. Then, he put his hands under me and started to rub himself on me. I just could not help feeling I was in need.</p> <p>He took the condom into his hand and handed it to me. I took it and put it on my erection. He knelt onto the floor beside me. We kissed. He held my penis and put it inside his mouth. I closed my eyes as I watched my penis slipping in and from his mouth. He pushed me over as he took all of me into his mouth and started going up and down. He kept moving and sucking as though I was his penis. I just stood there with my knees on the edge of the shower while he brought me back to life. I could no more stop him. I felt my back against the wall as he pushed me over to my toes and back down. He stopped for a moment and looked up his body. He looked at my face as I was staring down at his gorgeous face. He looked a little frightened, but knew exactly what he was doing. He pushed my feet farther apart and took his hands from my feet and brought them to my back. He took a finger and rubbed the opening of the condom on my penis. He took a small amount ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
