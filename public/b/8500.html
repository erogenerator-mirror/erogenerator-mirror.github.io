That had only taken two minutes. He turned to stare at her. She had that beautiful way of looking at him when she thought he didn't notice. Those blue eyes, and those lips. He hadn't noticed it earlier. His mouth began to water. He couldn't remember the last time he'd let her do it. He leaned toward her and reached out to touch her neck. Her eyes fluttering closed, her legs started shivering slightly when he touched her. He leaned in further. His hands caressing the curves of her throat as he kissed her. The scent that had just washed over him. Her lips parted allowing him more access. His hand slid down her back and came to rest on her ass. He could feel the texture of them through her shirt. He was starting to get hard and that made her pussy throb. She looked so sweet and innocent, she was driving him wild right now. She didn't seem to notice what they had just done.</p> <p>He was already kissing her neck when he heard her gasp. He moved his lips closer and more urgently, his tongue sliding across her skin. She tasted delicious and he could feel his hardness press against her. He slipped his hands up her shirt and he couldn't resist reaching around to cup a perfectly shaped breast. He leaned in over her. His lips left a trail of kisses that went deep into her throat and to her jaw before he started to nuzzle her. She was practically purring now. He sucked on her throat and then her jawline. She tasted like strawberries. Her mouth had parted just a bit allowing him to pull her shirt over her head. He reached forward to cup a breast in each hand, his hand not going all the way around to pinch at her nipples. He ran his fingers down the side of her neck, just to feel them harden. He bit down ever so slightly on one nipple before moving onto the other one. He started running his hands around her waist to cup her through her jeans. She felt so light in his hands. He pulled her body up against his until his face was against her neck. He kissed the hollow of her jaw and her earlobe. He kissed his way to her mouth, taking control of the moment. Their mouths met passionately, tongues dancing wildly. He felt so good at the kiss. He slipped one hand inside her denim and around behind her back to cup her ass, feeling the tightness of the jeans. He slipped a finger inside her and felt the wetness there. He moved his hand around to her front and pushed her jeans out of the way. He pulled off her shirt and kissed her upper torso. He slid the denim zipper down her legs.</p> <p>He pushed her jeans down at the same time he peeled off her underwear. His warm breath was warm on her skin as he slid her jeans down the rest of the way. Her feet landed on the floor and she kicked off her heels and started to kick her jeans off. He kissed her way slowly down her legs. He loved her smell, he had to get his mouth to her pussy. He wanted to taste how wet she was, how smooth she was. Her hips thrust forward slightly trying to encourage him. He didn't think he could do that so soon after watching as others did it. His tongue slid along her lips. He licked along the bottom of her lips, licking up to those pink pussy lips. He teased her ever so gently. He slid one finger inside of her, he could feel her muscles gripping him. He pushed deeper inside of her and then slowly pulled them from her body.</p> <p>He kissed her lips again, he loved to taste her. He slid his mouth down to her collar bone and nibbled it. He couldn't help himself as he pushed his finger in deeper, she tasted so sweet. He continued to explore her with his tongue until he felt her hips were shaking. He knew she wasn't far from cumming so he pulled his hand from her and sat up straight. She had never done that before and it turned her on. She watched him as he stood up. He looked so sexy standing there in front of her with his tented underwear showing. She smiled at him. "You like it don't you?" she said softly.</p> <p>He laughed to himself at her comment and responded with, "I thought you might like it." He reached down and lifted his t-shirt off the top of his head. He felt the weight of her there. She was right in front of him. Her breasts were perfect inches from his face and she made no effort to conceal her hard nipples. He grabbed one in each hand and lifted them up and looked up at her.</p> <p>She was looking back at him. "I've seen you before when you do it like that."</p> <p>He laughed. "I thought you might want to tell."</p> <p>Sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
