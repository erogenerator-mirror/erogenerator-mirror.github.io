I know where you are. Now I have to go to college to stay up all night." she spoke as she walked past me and out the door. Before she left I took her to a place that I had had so many times before.</p> <p>"Are you ok?" She looked back at me and asked.</p> <p>"I'm better than ok. Just remember that I am going to ask you if you want to go out there again." I told her.</p> <p>"You still have me scared though. Is that where you had me before? I feel like I am going to kill you. It scares me that you might find me. What is wrong with me now!" She said as she walked along the corridor back to where I was.</p> <p>"It's alright. I still love you and I will always love you. I can't see you anymore."</p> <p>"I know, and I love you too. You are a beautiful creature." As soon as she said it I saw some kind of pain come over her face.</p> <p>"I think I have already turned into a monster and you can see that."</p> <p>"No, you won't. I mean what is wrong with you. You just can't control things like this." She kept walking away and that's when I saw you look away.</p> <p>"I think you are beautiful. I'll go see if you have anything left to eat." We started walking again but as we walked I thought of things more than she and I. It was obvious that you knew everything and you never stopped to change the subject.</p> <p>I heard him talk a little but I didn't listen to it.</p> <p>We walked back to my apartment building and it was then I knew for sure. I thought it over, I also knew that I was going to ask her again about it after all she did say that she would never do it again.</p> <p>"So my friend has told you about me." I asked her as we walked back to my apartment.</p> <p>"No, I don't agree. At least not the way you might think."</p> <p>"You don't have to say anything. Just remember to be my friend and keep in touch with me. I always wanted a relationship with a friend," I reached up and kissed her cheek.</p> <p>"I still love you and I would never do anything to jeopardize that relationship. Not as long as you are with me, which is a good thing."</p> <p>"I still love you as much as you love me. If you were with me then I would still love you but I was afraid of what happened back there. I didn't want to risk you having feelings for me."</p> <p>"I'm sure you were afraid you couldn't hold out when you wanted to and now all you can say is," she took my hand and we started to walk again. She was a lot smarter this time.</p> <p>I never told you how much I liked her and I think I could have been that way around you all my life. We were never the same to each other.</p> <p>But I did want to keep it real. Because I could never have feelings for you. I tried to keep it there, but I guess I just wasn't able to live with myself when you showed up. I tried to convince you but you would never listen to me. I didn't want you feeling lonely because I felt alone, which never happened. One day when I really felt that loneliness I got so angry and I wanted to talk to you. I thought I would turn you down when I saw you standing in front of me. I could have ended it all but to have you come and ask me for help would have crushed me so much. Maybe I even had to kill you when you didn't give me enough time to think about it. No, what did you mean the whole situation, you are the one that started it."</p> <p>"I was mad but you were right. I don't know how long I could have done it if you hadn't come anyway. I did do what I think I did, the same thing, but you did it anyway and I'm not sure I'll ever forgive you. And I will never forgive myself if I get caught looking at you the last time we met, because you told me not to. I hope someday I have a chance at peace with myself. I want to make the two of us as a family and I will never try to do that. But you are my friend, for me and for you." She said as she stood there looking me in the eyes.</p> <p>Now I really have never been in a situation like this. I thought I could never be in her. She was like all my sister's friends and yet she was just as beautiful as me. Maybe because I am her best friend?</p> <p>"Ok but I hate to tell you this. But I know you have aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
