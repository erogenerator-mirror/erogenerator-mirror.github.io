Come to my house now."</p> <p>"I will," I said, and we were on our way.</p> <p>For some reason, it's not fair, so I waited a couple of days – it felt as if our relationship meant nothing to me. And then we got to her house.</p> <p>I rang her bell at six.</p> <p>I got the door and she ushered me inside. "Just a minute!" she said. "Take your clothes off."</p> <p>As I stripped immediately, my mind felt like it was on a roller coaster. I was nervous, but at the same time, I couldn't seem to make a sound.</p> <p>She opened the door and there he was. He had on a robe, and just looked at my naked body. "My cock is already hard," he said, and walked closer. I knew I should feel mortified, but instead I just stood up and walked towards him until I was in front of him.</p> <p>"Touch me," I said.</p> <p>"Of course." And he stroked me. My nipples got erect and my pussy got hot. My pussy was dripping wet. And then he took my hand. He led me inside, kissed me, and then led me into her bedroom, which had the same bed that I'd had with her earlier.</p> <p>"Lie down," she said. And I did. And then she took out some clothes from the wardrobe, which were lying on the floor. Then she knelt down between my legs. I couldn't tell her what to do, and she took hold of my pussy. For some reason she seemed to know the best thing to do was to give it oral sex. And there was nothing like pleasure in having a woman give you pleasure in order to keep you from getting sick. So she was doing a great job, but also, I was finding, a little difficult to concentrate on.</p> <p>By now my pussy was extremely wet with excitement. It felt like someone had been pounding into me all night. In fact, it was all the alcohol I'd consumed that day, and the two guys had obviously been doing everything I could to stop them. That's why I liked it so much.</p> <p>Then with no warning, something occurred to me. It was like a jolt of electricity ran through my pussy at the same time as it happened somewhere deep in my pussy at the same moment my nipples began to tingle.</p> <p>"Oh, God," I moaned. "Yes, yes, oh, yes." I let my hips lift up in anticipation of what was coming next.</p> <p>And the first sensation it caused was as if it were a electric shock to my nipple.</p> <p>"Oh yes," I cried out, as my first ever sexual orgasm hit. "Yes, yes, yes," I continued to repeat over and over again as orgasm after orgasm ripped through my body. I felt my pussy contract in tight spasms as I came.</p> <p>I couldn't believe how quickly it happened. My whole body was shaking, and I felt like I was having a seizure. There was no control of my body at all. It wasn't long before I felt faint.</p> <p>I collapsed on the bed and then felt very exhausted.</p> <p>"Thank you," I said as I fell into the next bed.</p> <p>Then I felt the bed move. There was someone being put into the middle of it. And then she was being moved towards me.</p> <p>I woke up, and found myself on the bed, with my dress being undone. And I knew that this was it. I was getting fucked!</p> <p>"Now it's your turn. Take us both now," she said. and I felt her move on the bed at the same time, getting on top of my body.</p> <p>I felt her lips kissing my nipples, her hand rubbing my pussy, and her tongue flicking my clitoris.</p> <p>"Come for me," she said. And that's all it took. I felt my orgasm begin.</p> <p>"Yes," I cried out as I felt my first orgasm explode, shooting through my whole body.</p> <p>She had been sucking my nipples because their excitement was too great to contain. I was cumming, again, and again, all the way from my toes upwards.</p> <p>"Oh God," I whispered. "Yes - yes, yes, yes!"</p> <p>And then I was being rolled onto my side and feeling her body pressed against mine.</p> <p>She was looking at me, smiling for me. Our bodies were pressed closely together.</p> <p>"Wow," I whispered, as an orgasm tore through me.</p> <p>"Oh yes," he answered for me. "I love your tits."</p> <p>I looked at him. He was still dressed, and I guess he—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
