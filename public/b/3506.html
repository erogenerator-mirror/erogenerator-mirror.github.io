The doctor's going to be on the next flight in a few minutes. You can't blame a girl for looking up to see what all goes on."</p> <p>"The doctor thinks I'm an American? Oh thank God, you don't know what just happened to me. It really hurts!"</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Of course I am! I've never been to the doctor before!"</p> <p>"I'm not even sure she's an American; I never seen pictures of her." I started laughing.</p> <p>"I didn't know she was so beautiful and funny."</p> <p>"The doctors are going to have a heart attack!"</p> <p>"Just wait until you get to meet her before you jump into the tub." I started to laugh, "But we might have a better chance. By the time their flight lands there's probably a hundred and fifty miles between us." I started laughing as I reached over to kiss him. We ended laughing and the doctor walked in.</p> <p>"I'm so good for you Brian but I'm not very good. Is there room in my stomach for you, my dear?"</p> <p>"Only because of the drugs, Doctor, no matter how much I'm willing to have you fuck me all night." I turned to go, "I'll be right back."</p> <p>"You can't get back into the tub, it's freezing wet."</p> <p>I laughed at him, "It's just the beginning, I can't wait anymore." I got in the tub and started to wash his body. I started by running my hands over his chest. Running across his six pack I ran my hands across a flat abdomen and I stopped to run across the back of his legs. He was breathing very heavily and I ran my hand up the front of his body. I gently ran my fingers up and down the length of his thighs a few times.</p> <p>He jumped when my fingers touched his cock, "Oh God!"</p> <p>"How was it?" I asked as I gently caressed him making him jump with delight.</p> <p>"Well, I was just going to turn over and take a nap, but I was just going to do my girl parts this way." Brian started laughing which made his cock go semi-hard and I smiled to myself. There wasn't any way this would be the first time he let me watch and I'd like to watch more.</p> <p>I started to lick the head of his cock, it wasn't the same as what I did with Bill, but it didn't hurt what I did as my tongue circled around the head just touching it. Brian started to stroke his cock with my hand, my other hand caressing his balls. I kissed and licked his cock, it began to harden in my hand. I sucked it into my mouth and as his cock began to harden I began to lick his balls. Brian almost yelled when I slid his cock into my mouth and began to slide it into my throat. Each time I would go all the way down, he'd jump and yell. I love the taste of both our juices.</p> <p>He was gasping for air as his cock was almost fully hard now. "What are you doing?" Brian asked and I turned to him.</p> <p>"Do you want me to suck you? I'm still hard! I don't think I can go another minute without it!" I pulled him into the tub with me and then straddled his legs making his cock slide across my wet pussy lips. I sat down, letting half of his cock slide into me. Brian could barely breathe, but he just started bucking his hips against my body and I got the hang of it and soon I had his whole cock buried to the hilt. We kissed, we kissed a lot. Brian's tongue probed my mouth. We held each other close as our body's got hotter and hotter. My hand found his balls and stroked them before finding his cock again, stroking it with my hand.</p> <p>"Oh God! I'm about to cum! Keep doing that!" Brian looked over at me and smiled before starting to thrust his hips as he shot his cum deep inside me. I leaned my head down to kiss him. We shared our cum together as our legs shook as we held each other close as our kisses turned passionate.</p> <p>"That was incredible!" I whispered into his ear and kissed his cheek, "We'll need to go back to the hotel to do it again. The doctor's there!"</p> <p>"Yes." he agreed as he kissed me and slid out of the tub. We got out and dried each other off before taking it off. We went back to the room, kissing and hugging each other. Brian and I had our favorite place, the bed. We slept like babies and did it several times each day. Every day was a learning moment as we couldâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
