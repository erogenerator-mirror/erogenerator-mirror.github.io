I hadn't cleaned out all the dishes. I had a few, which were clean.</p> <p>"You OK?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm fine. Come here," she said and pulled the back of my head around to face her, and began kissing me again. She tasted of me, soft on me, and her tongue darted out at my bottom lip, her lips sealed to caress mine. This was something that I had wondered about since the first time I had ever been with a girl. Even the girl I had slept with had said it would have been awkward. It had taken a little time, but I had learned to tolerate the initial shock a lot better. I did a great job of kissing her back to get her to let go of my own inhibitions and to let me know what that meant.</p> <p>She was obviously enjoying my kiss, because the next thing I knew, my shirt was on the floor, and her blouse was still tied, the buttons barely holding on to my shirt. I pulled away from her. "I can get it back on. You have to do that though." She looked up at me with a devilish smile.</p> <p>I started to undo the bottom button, but she pulled me back, her hands on my shoulders, and looked up at me. "Just don't move," she said.</p> <p>My hands were still at my sides, in front of my shirt; I had to unbutton a second or so. When I got to the last button, the shirt fell open. My hands were in full view as I tried to catch it in my hand, and with my fingers, it caught it again, and it fell off my arms.</p> <p>She was smiling from ear to ear, and I leaned back for a second to enjoy her view, her breasts were exposed, the nipples standing out proudly, her chest held up with a white lace bra. I leaned forward again, my hands in front of my chest, my shirt still pushed up around the base of my neck.</p> <p>"Are you sure you aren't wearing undergarments?" she asked me.</p> <p>I shook my head, unsure of her intention, but not really caring. I was too nervous to ask that question. I had made a big deal of it. I was supposed to be doing my own laundry, but this kind of show was new to me. I nodded my head in the affirmative.</p> <p>She reached down, and unbuttoned the next two buttons of my shirt. I leaned forward to let her pull it open wider, which she did with a little grin. Her hands reached around my waist, and I saw them cup my breasts. The feeling of that, topless, in front of someone else. Her hand caressing my breasts was making me forget everything else, I'd thought about nothing for the last week, my breasts had been hidden from both hands.</p> <p>I heard the door to my closet open, and looked up. My roommate sat in the chair beside me. She had her hands on her knees and her head in her hands. I looked around the room, she was still in her bra, and she had pulled the bra up over them. I had no idea why my own roommate wasn't standing there, and just watching this. She turned to face me. "I can't believe you are even still in that robe."</p> <p>"Um, you're not going anywhere," I said as I sat next to her, not looking at her in the face, but at her bare breasts right in front of my eyes. She leaned back into me, her arms resting on the arm rest of the chair. She had her back to me. "I was going to get rid like this."</p> <p>"Well, you know what to do. I'll bet you can get it back on."</p> <p>She looked down at her own breasts, and smiled, "My underwear got caught in there."</p> <p>"It's OK. This might get a little messy, I'd be happy to help." I lifted my arms away from my chest, and she slipped it off me.</p> <p>I took a quick glance at her to see if she was trying to hide what she was doing, but she didn't seem to mind. It might not be right. It couldn't be right with just this.</p> <p>"Turn around," I said.</p> <p>She did as I asked, putting her hands on her hips, but not moving them. "I guess you like the idea. I can tell," she said. We both chuckled a little. "I've been thinking about this myself."</p> <p>She turned her back toward me and put her hand on the back of my neck, pulling me down beside her. She reached around my neck with her other hand and gave me another kiss before she stood up and dropped the robeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
