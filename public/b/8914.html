I had a bottle of wine waiting for me, a little later than usual. As soon as people started showing up, I ordered wine and danced. I also went dancing with some of my friends. For that reason, I was really enjoying the place. It took only a few dances before they asked me to dance. I told them that I enjoyed it and they gave me a wink that made my body heat up even more. In return, I got to know them and felt good. By the end of the evening, I had gotten used to them.</p> <p>It was time to call it a night and I was a little disappointed. I was planning to call it a night with more champagne when the waiter returned with the main course. I told him that I was going home and I wanted to enjoy some private time with him. He nodded and I decided to have some fun with him. I was planning to spend an evening with him anyway. It wasn't going to be a good evening for my date and didn't look like a good one for me. I wasn't in any mood to waste it.</p> <p>We had a light dinner at one of our favorite places and had a few drinks. The waiter didn't have to know that we had drinks so I made sure that I sat opposite him. By the end of the evening, the champagne was having the usual effect. I was feeling relaxed about the evening. The waiter seemed to be paying attention too, as if he was wondering if I was going to do anything special. One time, I made an excuse about going home. It made me feel really good to have it going on me.</p> <p>I told him that I wanted to do something for him. I asked him if he would mind if I got a little more relaxed about things. He seemed really surprised but said that he would love to get to know me and I told him that I wanted him to enjoy himself. He got a real big grin on his face and told me that he would be happy to show me all around the city. I smiled and thanked him as I got up to dance.</p> <p>Since the night wasn't going as I wanted it to, I wasn't ready to go home yet. I asked him if he would like to come back to my place tonight. He told me that his girlfriend was very upset with me and was wondering what to do about it.</p> <p>I told him that I didn't want him to do anything to me that I didn't want to do. He said that it wouldn't be cheating. Since it was a special night for me I didn't want to say anything that was going to shock him. Plus, the wine really kicked it up a notch. He couldn't understand why I didn't want to go home, especially with the drinks flowing. I told him that if he agreed to have a romantic date for tonight, that would be so much better than being home alone. When he hesitated I told him that he didn't have to and that I would just be over in the next 15-30 minutes. I was feeling quite tipsy by now and asked him if he were ready to have fun.</p> <p>When he was ready, he looked me in the eyes and said that it sounded great. I gave him a big wide smile. I told him that I wanted to be the one to be the first one to take him to my bed. He was surprised at this and smiled at me and said that it was my turn now. I was a bit puzzled for a moment. When he saw that I wasn't going to leave, he took the glass from my hand and brought it over. We were still holding hands but not very close. I took the glass and held it by the stem between my lips. I told him that he had to taste me and that he would have to try everything with his first attempt. He didn't really argue and I had no problem finishing his drink without a problem.</p> <p>He took a little longer than he expected and after a short while, he got it over with and I could feel some of his saliva dripping from the corners of my mouth. This seemed to be what was going to happen. I was definitely nervous about what would happen there. He was starting to get a little rough. When he came down on me with his lips, some of the alcohol got mixed together with my mixed body heat and I got really horny. He took hold of me by my hip and started to hump me. I just kept right on my feet but we had made love before. When we finally pulled apart he was still very worked up. I wasn't really interested in being a bit of a pain in the ass but I was really horny.</p> <p>I asked him what to do next. He looked at the bartender and told him that his wife wanted him to come with her tonight. He told them that he'd wait for herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
