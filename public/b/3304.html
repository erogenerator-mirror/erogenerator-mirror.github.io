I could see it growing in her hand.</p> <p>"Yes," I whispered. I was barely able to say anything coherently. I don't think I can get enough of this moment.</p> <p>With that Amanda turned around slowly and pulled the blanket over us and off me.</p> <p>After she had climbed into bed next to me she slowly pulled the covers down exposing herself once more for the first time in over a week.</p> <p>"Oh my," Amanda whispered. She pushed me to my back and crawled on top of me.</p> <p>I could only moan in my head as I felt her slowly taking his cock in her hand and begin to rub it in my pussy.</p> <p>I could not see what she was doing as I imagined her playing with my pussy. I could hear her breathing heavily as she rubbed it against my pussy.</p> <p>"Oh my Amanda," I whispered into the night. "That feels so good." I was now in a state of constant pleasure as she moved her fingers over my clit.</p> <p>I could hear Amanda's moans clearly as she played with my pussy and her free hand was moving between us.</p> <p>She pulled her mouth away from mine, looking me in the eyes and said. "I know that you can't take it anymore. I can't take any more. You've made me cum just by putting my dick in your hands."</p> <p>She pushed deeper onto my pussy and said. "Your pussy is so hot, lover."</p> <p>We both exploded together, both of our orgasms exploding into each other over and over. We were both spent. When she finally pulled herself off my hand she lay beside me on her side. I think she was asleep before she had said anything and I was pretty sure there was no way that I could move. I was spent.</p> <p>I slept for a while. I was asleep. When I woke up it was 7 AM. I hadn't slept that well in ages. I took a piss and made sure enough room was lit. I sat naked on the couch with the TV next to me and watched some mindless soap opera until I fell asleep.</p> <p>I slept so soundly that I was surprised when Amanda, who is usually asleep in the morning, woke up around 10 AM. She quickly grabbed some clothes and headed to the kitchen for some coffee. When she returned I just put the coffee on. When she sat there, drinking her coffee without even looking at me, I just said. "You must hate me," I said. She turned bright red but continued her story.</p> <p>"After I was through with my coffee I got up and went to the bathroom to check my hair for my make-up. I couldn't make it because of the hair in the tub but I just looked at my hair and decided that I liked it," She said. She finished her coffee and looked at me. "I was a bit embarrassed of being so open to you but I was also excited about the opportunity of getting to fuck you. I figured tonight would be an appropriate time."</p> <p>"You were?" I whispered. She grinned at me, knowing that I was not a wimp.</p> <p>"I was not sure if I wanted to but my husband had his hands all over my body and I just found this moment to come. I am really turned on about being here. I can't get over how you made me feel so good." She slid her hand down and grabbed his balls and started stroking it. I looked at her as I slid away from the couch. I was about to tell her not to be so forward when she pulled on his dick and kissed his dickhead like I had done to her. She slowly kissed it as she rubbed it against her lips. Soon his dick was hardening as she sucked it as hard as Amanda had her. With a deep groan he shot his load into her mouth as she was still kissing it as it left.</p> <p>He was silent as Amanda sucked him dry so that she could get every last drop of his cum without making a sound. I looked at Amanda as she sat there sucking his sperm off her tongue, lips, and chin and smiling at me.</p> <p>"We better get showered," she said. I nodded that I understood and started getting dressed.</p> <p>When we pulled up to her house we walked to hers. I could have stayed there all day looking at her gorgeous face. I was about to get dressed, when Amanda asked me if I had any panties. That was an unexpected turn on for me.</p> <p>"I have no panties; I just had a tigress bring them."</p> <p>"I saw the panties on the street and I just can't get them. Do you have something on you that will fit?" she asked.</p> <p>"Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
