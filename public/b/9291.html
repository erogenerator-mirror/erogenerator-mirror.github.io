Right here."</p> <p>He slid two fingers into her pussy again, pumping them in and out, faster and faster. "You want me to fuck you here?" his eyes said. "You want me to fuck you in a hot shower? You want me to fuck on a bench in front of a restaurant?" She nodded, and spread her legs wide. "Or in a classroom?"</p> <p>"In a gym." He said, and he pumped his fingers in and out with his thumb in a circular motion.</p> <p>"No, let me. You can do anything you like right here. Just hold me," she whispered.</p> <p>He pulled his fingers out and lifted her leg so she could reach up and kiss them. The other one she brought to her mouth also. "I want you to keep saying I'm beautiful. Don't want to lose it," she smiled. "Say it."</p> <p>"Yes," he said. "I'm lovely." He pulled his clothes off and knelt in front of her, his knees on either side of hers. He bent his head down to kiss her. "And I am handsome. You're stunning. Can we keep going like this, baby? Make love?" The kiss ended.</p> <p>"Yes you should be, John," she whispered, and they shared the first taste of his tongue. She gasped. She held his back and raised herself on him so he could enter her. It was as if he were on the brink.</p> <p>He thrust in slowly, almost withdrawing, and it sent her over the edge. As it started to build, she grabbed his face and held it to hers, and they kissed deeply. The kiss began with grunts. She kissed his chest, his ribs and finally, his lips. She tasted the residue from their previous coupling. Their tongues touched as if for the first time.</p> <p>In moments, he exploded inside her. Their mouths parted and their breath came in quick sharp bursts. Her eyes rolled in her head as she came, and she fell to his chest.</p> <p>He pulled her close and kissed her mouth and ear. "We do this all the time," he whispered, trying to be gentle. "Sometimes. We feel special. I guess it makes me feel special."</p> <p>"We love each other," she answered. "God, I love you for that. If I had to choose, I'd go for you." He lay her on the bench as he kissed her mouth and her forehead. "Come on, baby, we have to get to your car. We can kiss, then I want to go for you."</p> <p>"I'll drive," she said shyly.</p> <p>"If this is love, I don't care."</p> <p>They embraced gently. "We'll have to just keep on the way," she whispered. "I'm not sure I can kiss, but, you know, it would be nice if we just keep on going like we have with everything else."</p> <p>"No, I mean." John's hands caressed and teased her as he tried to catch his breath. "We'll just stay here as long as we possibly can. You can kiss me anywhere just like this."</p> <p>"I feel like I'm missing out on a romantic setting. I've got to get my mind back on the big thing right here." They snuggled. "Maybe you should just stay with me longer." She leaned her head on his chest. "I just want to stay here forever." She kissed his stomach. "I like the feel of our skin."</p> <p>"I do too," he said. He cupped himself and held her naked body close to him. "You've got to feel that you're loved."</p> <p>"We don't have much time. I'm not sure I'm ready to go back to normal." She kissed him again. "I can do this."</p> <p>"Let's just be gentle."</p> <p>"All right," she sighed. "But let's stop at my place first. I have a lot to do first."</p> <p>John kissed her forehead and down her cheek. He reached up to her chin and caressed her lips.
