He said, grabbing me by my arm, I didn't know what else to say but I just leaned against him. A moment later I felt my shirt being ripped off and soon my bra too. I was naked from the waist up and I wanted desperately to see them, but in the back of my memory I saw how beautiful they both seemed to be.</p> <p>"Come on!" I said with a laugh. He just nodded his head like a little boy. I walked around the table to where he was seated. It took him a moment to look me over. With a sexy smile I made my way to his lap once again. I began by placing a soft kiss right on his lips, not really a kiss, a soft kiss that lasted all the way through my mouth. Soon I moved off the chair, I ran my head back down to his cock slowly so as not to damage his wonderful member, as I grabbed it and took it back into my mouth, I could just barely get my lips around it. I slid two fingers inside him making sure not to touch the wet flesh. My other hand went to his balls as I began to slide my fingers in and out just a little, I could feel the warm stickiness I was causing in him.</p> <p>I could feel that the precum was being drawn out and dripping over my fingers in small droplets. I then had to reach up, I cupped his cock with one hand and began to massage his shaft with the other. Slowly I kissed around the head of his penis as I used my hand to work it back and forth, I even tried to put it into my mouth, but to no avail, he placed his hand over mine to stop me from doing so. I began to move my mouth a little faster and a little faster till my lips touched the head of his cock, I knew he was getting close. I could feel the first surge as his semen began to pump out of his slit towards me. I began to move my mouth up and down faster with my hand, a little faster than I was, the whole thing seemed to go on forever till I felt it building up inside of him again. I moved my hand off his cock and took him back inside again, I got a good grip as my own body began to tingle on its own.</p> <p>I kept the motion going, my tongue swirled around the head of his penis as I could feel another twitch. I began to go down a little on him a little, I knew then he had to cum as well. I began to pump him up and down with my hand as I stroked him with my mouth. Again I felt his cock swelling up and the feeling as it was getting ready to cum as well. I had to swallow quickly or I’d miss the whole event. He pushed my head down harder now as his cock began to swell even larger and the first shot of cum shot out into my mouth as I continued to stroke him in a small rhythm as I began to swallow. This time there were only two shots of semen left by his cock, the first hit my right eye, followed by the second shot, he aimed up at my face. The sight caused me to continue to work his cock, still shooting my own climax for a minute till he stopped shooting, still wanting to feel his sperm, before I sucked it back into me.</p> <p>The thought of him cumming like that made me want to touch myself. Without a second thought I moved back up his legs to where he could see where it ended, and slid my finger along my own slit. I rubbed myself for a while, thinking about how it all felt, just the thought was beginning to get me worked up again, my hand found it and began to stroke it while my other hand played with my clit, I could feel the first wave of my own climax building. As the second wave was beginning to hit me, I pulled my hand off of my pussy and began the stroking again, another wave of my own would follow. A little later I had another orgasm all of the while playing with myself just for a moment.</p> <p>After a long, long time, I pulled my fingers away from my pussy and stood up. A moment later, I felt a wet kiss on my lips from his finger. "I still think it would be a good idea if you stayed the night." He said as my eyes met his. He leaned back and ran his hands a little longer on my body before pulling me on top of him, he picked me up and slid up my body to his face, kissing all over my body making his way down from the tops of my legs, slowly making it up my torso as it went. It was the first time my body had ever felt the softness of him, and his mouth. It felt amazing, knowing the softness of him would never leave. His body, still covered, he looked so strong as—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
