What is it?"</p> <p>"I got a couple in the mail. You don't mind, do you?"</p> <p>"I've just never really given a guy a chance. You sure?"</p> <p>"Sure," he replied. The conversation was friendly. "No big deal. Just nice to get my motor running."</p> <p>"Why don't you drive your car tomorrow and maybe work in it on top of lunch?" she suggested.</p> <p>"Oh, that makes sense," he agreed.</p> <p>"Oh? You don't smoke?" she queried.</p> <p>"Nope, never did. But no, I don't have a smoke joint or a pot. That's fine by me. It's not a big deal to smoke with someone like you, is it?"</p> <p>She laughed. The conversation drifted, she enjoyed it and his company was always pleasant.</p> <p>"So when's the next time I can have lunch with you?" she asked.</p> <p>"Oh, my, not again. Can we do this again."</p> <p>"Ok, but we have to do this a week or two from today. It's been a while."</p> <p>"Okay, I'll see you tomorrow at 10:00 AM," he replied. "You coming, too?" he asked.</p> <p>"I'll get a cab and I'll bring my car around."</p> <p>"I'll see you tomorrow morning. Have fun. Take care," he said.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Copyright (c) May, 2015</p> <p>Every five years a tribute to an author is published in the Literotica contest, by a writerâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
