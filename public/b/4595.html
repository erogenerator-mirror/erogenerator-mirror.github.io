I am not a lesbian, although I certainly have fantasies about more than a girl. But for now I have been doing a little window dressing, letting my thoughts and fantasies take over and keep them under control for the time being.</p> <p>I've been married ten years, and had two children, now seventeen and nine. My wife divorced me when we both graduated at the same time, and she went off on a business trip and I was left to look after our children. Unfortunately, that all changed. We've been divorced for eight years now and I'm finally beginning to have it out with a realtor and finally living in my own home. I'm not going to have anyone else live or live with me either, even though this is where I have an overwhelming desire to give it a go.</p> <p>But I won't, I can't, and if I had to choose between living on the street and living in a hotel, I would choose the hotel. It is an apartment complex and you live in the main one, so that makes it one large room.</p> <p>When I got home from work that night and my kids were being watched, I decided to see if my apartment would suit me. The apartment we lived in had another king size bed and I loved being in the other bed. The windows in the upstairs rooms were closed because the sun was getting really close, so when we had the electricity turned down, I thought it would be cooler down there, but there were no other lights on that night.</p> <p>I walked to the window and saw that the sun was beginning to go off, but there were no other lights on, just the street lights, and the wind was blowing across the street and getting stronger. I was feeling kind of dirty, especially after having had that kind of night, being pretty sure there weren't people down at the bar, so I got all over myself, starting kissing my tits and running my fingers through my hair.</p> <p>I slowly got up so that I was lying back on the bed and let my skirt slip up and off of me as well. I felt like a naked and very hot woman, and it was quite exciting. I was now standing there naked, and I could see that my hands were all over my skin, including my pussy. I rubbed my clit as I sat up and ran my fingers through my hair. It was all I could do not to moan as the waves of pleasure that washed over me were so intense that I had to stop myself from saying 'fuck you', it felt so much better than 'fuck my son'. "Fuck you, fuck you baby", I imagined saying, as I brought myself to another huge orgasm.</p> <p>Then I got back down on the bed and began to rub my nipples, moaning as they became hard and erect. I felt very wet and sticky all over, but also very excited. I could see that even though it was dark in the bedroom, the lights of the street outside were dim enough to show my wetness.</p> <p>I sat up at the edge of the bed and slid the rest of the way down so that I was lying there in front of him. I saw his face, and felt a wave of dizziness rise up in me, at the same time, my heart thumped in my chest. He wasn't looking at me, at those eyes. He was staring at me, with his mouth open and his lips very faintly touching his lips. I was frozen again, as he looked intensely at me. I looked at him and saw his lips moving, his breath coming quicker as he spoke.</p> <p>"My name is Daniel, and your name is Mary Ann?" He said in all the confidence he had.</p> <p>"You should call me Mary." I heard myself say. "The one you were fucking when you walked in the door." I added.</p> <p>"Your son calls me Mary Ann." He said back. "He's my father, and he was a part of my life for about twenty-eight years." He said as he got up and walked around me, looking at me. "I think you may want to get a couple of clothes on before you get in bed with me tonight, as your mind is going wild."</p> <p>"That sounds exciting to me" I said, not so sure that I really meant it.</p> <p>"It's just that it always feels really good to me to cum thinking about you and that you love me. I'm not sure that I can do it as much as I want to, but I want to try." He said. "Mary is the only woman I've ever really had sex for, I've always said that it was wrong, but I love it. But that wasn't the first time I did it." he said.</p> <p>Oh God, I thought. That was so good, and Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
