"Now how about a little test drive?"</p> <p>Before I could answer that question, he pulled me down onto the bed by the head and mounted me. For the first time since we had begun, he slid into me with very little difficulty. His hands ran over the sides of my breasts, his fingers touching my nipples and then slipping down to run their fingers through my pubic hair where they met my pussy. Even through the fabric of my suit, his cock was hard against me. He moved slowly at first, enjoying the feeling of having the control that he had come to realize he needed. He moved his other hand down, and I found that he had been working his cock into me for a while that the friction of his cock was enough to make me moan. He began to move slowly between my legs.</p> <p>He made love to me slowly at first, sliding into me over and over again until he was fully seated between my thighs. There was a moment of awkwardness when I had taken him inside me and he had begun to pick his pace. He slid in and out, a little deeper each time so that he could reach my clit and increase his pleasure. It was as if his hands were part of our relationship now, as if we were each being both the sex of this moment. The only way to describe this feeling was that it was as if we were one being as if it was the first time we had made love, not just the first time.</p> <p>He moved with me. His hand came up to rub at my breast the same way, only his fingers moving just beneath it, his thumb rubbing over my nipple sending shivers through my entire body. He leaned forward, his lips capturing my nipple, my body twisting in pleasure with his every movement. I put my hands over his, my fingers running over his back.</p> <p>My hands found his neck again and the heat seemed to radiate into him. I could feel the muscles tensing beneath his skin as he moved inside me, and I could feel the walls of his cock pulsing within me. His hand slid across my stomach, trailing down to tease at my waist, and then moving to my belly button where, like my breasts, it was exposed in all its length. My hands slid upward toward my body to wrap over his as he pulled me closer, the way he had done the last time. My hands ran over his back and shoulders.</p> <p>It was the only thing that I knew about how to move, or what I wanted to do when I had him in me. He ran his hands along my arms and reached behind himself to caress my ass cheeks, pulling me toward him every time he came into contact with me. His cock slid out of me easily, and he pulled me onto his lap again. When our thighs came together again, his whole body convulsed, and his hands cupped my breasts. "You are like the center of a universe, you and this world," he breathed as our mouths met for the first time. "And I feel that way myself, inside that little body." It was the way I spoke when we were making love, as if we were both speaking at the same time. "And inside, you are all mine," I whispered, as I kissed my way down his chest, to his legs, where I parted one, and ran a finger up his length. "I love that you're in me, too." He leaned his head back, and pulled my mouth to his for a passionate kiss. Our bodies slid together faster, their movements matching each others intensity. We came together, one, then the other, our lips and tongues and bodies intertwined until finally we both stopped. We lay in each other's arms, kissing each others cheeks, our eyes, eyes and hair. "That was, is, incredible," I whispered after we finally caught our breath.</p> <p>"Incredible," he said. "Incredible." All we could talk about was how we had made love and how much we loved each other.</p> <p>We lay there in each other's arm, caressing our fingers through the hair on those wonderful skin. I think I fell asleep before we got out of bed, although I knew that I had not. It had been a wonderful day and the thought of how it had affected every part of my life flashed through my mind. It hadn't been that much of a change over the last two years. Our feelings for each other as well as our marriage grew stronger. I could always love him, but my heart never wanted to be with him. I never wanted to see him as I had seen him - I had only seen a glimpse of the things he had, and the things that seemed to take all time. I felt that I hadn't made myself more attractive to women.</p> <p>But Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
