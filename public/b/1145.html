I said as I stood up.</p> <p>She looked like she was going to cry.</p> <p>"If we stay here for the rest of the day," I said, "then I expect you to go into the store. No work until tomorrow morning. And I hope you get yourself all dressed for work by then."</p> <p>Before she could say anything, I moved toward the door.</p> <p>"Don't go," I said as I turned and watched her jump up on the counter. "You stay, and maybe some other time. If you want a cup of coffee, just ask me to make you a cup." And with that I grabbed a handful of toilet paper and walked out the door, leaving her in the sink trying to wash herself and make herself presentable for work.</p> <p>"I hope you're not mad at me," she said, and I smiled. She walked out slowly. I walked to the shop front where I could hear the other girls walking away from the counter and down the hall.</p> <p>I took two long strides towards my little girl and pulled her to me.</p> <p>"Hi... I'm Sarah," I said after I took her by the elbow again. Then I pulled her into me once more and wrapped my arms around her, hugging her tightly as she cried into my shoulder.</p> <p>After a couple of minutes, I turned in the direction of the front door and opened it. A huge red bag was hung on the worktop, but not in the way you would have expected from a red bag. In the bag was a pink vibrator set and a bottle of lube. I opened the bag and found a black dildo and two pair of handcuffs, with a pair of pink silk handcuffs, and a pink silk box.</p> <p>"I told you I didn't have any toys." Sarah said and we turned to face one another. She held my face and smiled at me, running her hands over my body.</p> <p>"I thought I would find out that the vibrator thing worked," I said as I stepped back a little, taking her hands in mine. Sarah smiled, as we looked into each other's eyes. "I want to keep you, baby."</p> <p>"I love you, too, and I've got to know that you love me just as much as your mom and dad do." I said softly. After I finished my sentence, I turned and kissed her lips softly, then pulled away again and looked deep into her eyes. "But, it's only for a little time before I have to go to work on a case we got caught in. It's going to be hard on both your mom and dad."</p> <p>Sarah smiled and leaned in to kiss me again. "I know, but maybe we'll go out when we're both free and let our mom and dad see to my needs, too."</p> <p>"Okay, Sarah," I said, pulling her in close and walking out as I closed the door behind me. "See you tomorrow."</p> <p>~~~~~</p> <p>After Sarah went home, I drove to the local drug store. I picked up a bunch of supplies and asked the clerk to get me some cash.</p> <p>"And what am I buying, sweetie?" I asked him, when I got back to my car.</p> <p>"What I want you to do is go visit your father."</p> <p>"And what is it going to be that I'll have to do, sweetie?"</p> <p>"Don't you worry about it, sweetie," he said. "Your dad is going to be home with you next week. There are a lot of reasons but you will figure them out. Now I'm giving you a discount, so that at least half of the sale is covered."</p> <p>"Thank you, sweetie," I said and smiled.</p> <p>~~~~~</p> <p>Monday, 2:00 AM</p> <p>When I got off work the next day, I was excited; my baby sat on my lap with her head resting on my shoulder as I held her gently and stroked her hair. She was in a really happy frame of mind at that moment.</p> <p>"Thank God it's over, Dad," she said softly. "I'm so happy for you."</p> <p>I gave her one of those looks that you give a teenager when something's happened to them early or something. I'm not saying that your parents are going to blame me for whatever mistakes you made at the time, but you'll remember I said that the second we got together, you would understand and that it wouldn't happen again and never again. That just means that you're going to remember it and that I'm the one standing between you and your father. And I was right." I said with a smile as I held her close to me.</p> <p>After school I watched her as she walked to her car.
