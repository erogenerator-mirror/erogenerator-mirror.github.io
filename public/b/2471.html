"I just really need to get out of here."</p> <p>"Well I don't have any plans," she answered. "Just come around the corner and I'll take you back to my place afterwards. I promise it won't be any trouble."</p> <p>"Alright."</p> <p>"I'll walk with you," she said. As they drove back to her place she held onto him tightly, the feel of his body pressing against her, and she knew that her feelings were allayed. For some reason she felt completely alive and it was exciting to have a man around her now.</p> <p>It had all been fairly easy to find at first, there were no awkward questions or awkward looks, just a general sense that they were as one-in-a-basket. After that they'd learned to make the most of each other, they'd known how to say the most to each other. Once they'd gone out with the usual dating scene, they'd even gone to dinner together, although that was probably another reason that it was so easy.</p> <p>That was the one thing that they'd learned about each other and they were in some ways the same. They both had good reason, but when she was feeling vulnerable and he needed her body close to his and he needed her in his bed, he needed to make sure that she would always be available to him.</p> <p>It had been easier than he thought it would be, but he always loved the way it was done. It was like a different kind of play and he loved to think that everyone could be counted on to make the most of what they found in each other.</p> <p>Their mutual attraction was almost as strong as they'd been at first, and once they'd learned how to make their own emotional exchange, that was a major step for both of them and for them well, it was the second time in their relationship that they had an open dialogue.</p> <p>The two of them had been together for eight years before he met Janice. They were both in their third year of graduate school and had been doing the same thing for two years. Even though she was a beautiful woman, Janice's beauty always made him want to try to be more physically intimate with her, but he had never really come across the kind of woman she was.</p> <p>It was just a year earlier that they'd had their first experience of mutual masturbation and neither of them had complained. Janice's experience had made her very hot and he'd done just that.</p> <p>They'd both enjoyed every minute of the first few minutes and she'd been amazed at just how many sensations he'd got as he'd masturbated her. It was like she'd done something that her own body had been designed to do, he'd always told her. It wasn't that he couldn't do it, but once he'd made her cum it was her experience and his that was the best she'd ever had.</p> <p>She'd been thrilled to find that some guys just had the ability to do that, and if the fact that she knew he'd had a girlfriend, that made him special. And she'd been impressed when he'd started dating Janice that he'd be able to, um, make her cum. She'd told him that she loved to experience a man masturbating and she'd never done it before except in books and on the computer.</p> <p>Now she found herself looking forward to the next encounter with him.</p> <p>The second day, they'd spent the weekend together. They'd gone back to her place and stayed up all night playing with each other, kissing, touching, rubbing, just doing everything that they'd been doing so many years before. They took their clothes off and lay in bed, holding each other close. She'd told him that he'd never had a girlfriend and she'd always had a thing for long-term guys and even though he loved to play with them as much as she did, she'd never really acted on some of the things she'd heard in the stories that she'd read, but sometimes she fantasized about it as a sexual activity. Sometimes she'd let his manhood slide into her slit, sometimes up into her asshole, and sometimes into her pussy. Sometimes she'd let him cum inside her mouth as she sucked him and she'd sometimes let him cum on her breasts.</p> <p>In fact, they'd managed to get each other off twice more that night and then she'd finally got done with him.</p> <p>This was their first "naughty" encounter together.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>"Don't go home to your boyfriend," she'd explained as she'd put down the keys to her Toyota. "He'll think that he's cheating on you."</p> <p>His girlfriend had seemed to have little trouble hearing him, and had said something like, "Well there's nothingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
