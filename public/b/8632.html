Please leave me alone." she begged.</p> <p>She began to cry and it was only then that he knew she was in tears. He stroked her hair and kissed her forehead.</p> <p>"Please, sweet pet. I think I would still love to stay in your bed." he said softly.</p> <p>She nodded and they both walked back to their room.</p> <p>They stopped at a table and she told him she wanted to try out the bed again.</p> <p>"Not yet, my pet. We are going to be busy tonight. We are going to need to make sure everything is in place. I may decide to tell my mom that you had the flu and I have to tell her you're sleeping on the couch again. Is that understood?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes, my son." she replied.</p> <p>He grinned as he looked at her, "I love you, I love you with all my heart and soul. And I will love you all the time!" He said before kissing her cheek.</p> <p>That night, she slept like hell with him under the sheets. He could still feel her wet, warm body next to his. He was so excited that he almost fell asleep himself. He knew he had to wait a little longer before he finally fell asleep.</p> <p>He woke up early, showered, did his job, and then found himself alone. He smiled to himself as he pulled his robe on. He walked out to the kitchen just as he heard his Mom's car start. He smiled back to her as she drove over. They talked a bit and she got out. He admired her naked legs as they were long and lean and strong for her age. She was probably in her late 50's. He noticed her large breasts as they were capped by large pinkish nipples that looked very tempting to him. He knew better and he wanted to taste them so badly.</p> <p>They talked and laughed along the way and she asked him about the business she was in. It turned out she was pregnant and he guessed she was in her late 60's. She was pretty quiet and he knew she had a daughter growing up in her and was afraid to talk about anything. They talked about their new house and her hopes and dreams for having children with her Mom. He knew he was not the only one, but at that moment he had no other ideas or need to hear that.</p> <p>They were almost done and he offered to put them in the fridge to cool down. She agreed and left him to get dressed. He watched her walk out and smiled at the large, swaying ass she had when she stepped in his home. She pulled her tee shirt over her head and slipped her shorts on. She left his robe and she went back to her room to get her things. As she neared the door, she smiled at herself as she thought about the way he kissed her. She smiled again as she saw her son on the edge of the bed with clothes still on. He was staring down the room at her as he walked toward her with her shirt and shorts still on. "Mom!" he said in a whisper and she looked up in shocked surprise. "You look amazing!" was his only response as he pulled her robe loose from her body. "Did you sleep alone?" he asked and she could feel her face flush.</p> <p>"No. I slept with you, in my bed. No more sleeping in here. I have a boyfriend and we are going out tomorrow night. We just thought we would be the perfect couple to spend the week in a romantic setting and get away from everything. I had no idea it was going to be that kind of night. You had no idea that was going on either!" she said in embarrassment, trying to keep her excitement to a minimum. He reached up and put his hands on her cheek in a caress.</p> <p>He softly caressed the curve of her cheek and she almost moaned out in pleasure. He lowered his head to kiss her softly as he pulled her shirt over her shoulders and let it stay there. She was surprised when she felt his body press against her and she instinctively reached up and grabbed the bottom of his t-shirt.</p> <p>The kiss he gave her took away her breath and she melted into him. He held her as he kissed her mouth gently and then her throat. She moaned into his lips as they rubbed against each other, loving the soft caress of his skin against hers. She reached down to find his shorts and could feel the warmth of his arousal as he touched her as he pressed himself against her. She moaned again when she felt his organ. He slid his fingers along the length of her thighs and they parted slightly, almost as if teasing her. Their mouths again locked in embrace and he moved to the other side of the bed. She looked over at him and sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
