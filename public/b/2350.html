I could always do a lot better than this if you like."</p> <p>I said "Oh I like you, honey. I like you a lot. I'd like to continue your education if you'd care to join me."</p> <p>He sat back down in my old recliner with our drinks. His smile vanished; his eyes were as glassy and he had a strange look in his eyes. I got the feeling that he was about as excited about this conversation as I had ever seen. I was beginning to suspect that something more than just having a beer wouldn't work but I didn't want to spoil it. I could tell after a few seconds that he was getting very excited. I just smiled at his enthusiasm. I also realized that I wanted this to continue.</p> <p>It went on like that for quite some time. He seemed to have the answer of everything except for one thing: The way he looked at me, how he ate his lunch and the way he got up to leave the table. He just kept looking at me and smiling. He had a different attitude on that night because he never stopped smiling. He just seemed to get more excited. I found myself feeling like a little girl again.</p> <p>I wanted the fun to continue, but after several minutes I still wasn't in the mood to continue. I decided to give him a chance. I went to the bar across from the room we used to party and picked up a couple bottles of beer. I sat back down and he stood up at the bar and said "Come on in." The young man walked in with a couple glasses.</p> <p>I sat the empty glasses in a bag and walked over to him. I grabbed the bottle and said, "Here you go," as I handed him his bottle. I went to the corner of the bar near the door and handed him a beer. I turned back to him and smiled at him and said, "Are you gonna get another one?"</p> <p>He smiled and said, "Oh yeah. I was almost tempted to go again. The beer was too good."</p> <p>I smiled at him and said, "Well, you've got a good attitude, but I think it's time for you to move on. I don't think this place is ever going to be what you want anymore."</p> <p>It took a couple seconds for him to say, "Thanks, but it's been like that for me ever since I found out about these people. I just want to stay with who I am."</p> <p>He smiled at me and said, "I hope you're right. That's how you came to be with us in the club."</p> <p>I said, "You can say that again. If I was as much of a prude as I thought I was, I'd be a dead girl right now."</p> <p>He just smiled at me and said, "I told you so. I know you're the good looking one but the old lady says that women don't sleep with men like that."</p> <p>He smiled at me and said, "Thank you for saying that. Maybe if you came with us, I could get you here a little sooner to get back home." They say in the club to get your stuff.</p> <p>My face must have showed a bit more color because a few guys started taking pictures of my body. They kept clicking and making lots of money. It was so nice.</p> <p>When he left, I sat the empty glass down on the bar and sat down on the recliner. I held my hand out to him so that he had a chance to get more comfortable. He smiled at me and said, "Let's go back to the old place and get to know each other better. I'm not going to let you go back to the place that night."</p> <p>We got up from the bar, and walked through our room. His arm draped casually over my shoulder as he led me to the bedroom. It took a moment for him and me to get the room and get some things started again. I went to the bathroom and started thinking about the things that I'd said to him on the way homeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
