She squirmed again, almost as though she were offering me her sweet nectar; her sex was now on fire. I pressed a finger into her wetness, and she pressed back as I slowly slid it in, her eyes closed. She was so wet and warm, I slid half in at a time before starting to pull it back out. Her arms flailed, her hips pushed up in the air, trying to force those fingers out. I reached between us and found her clit with my fingertip and thumb and began to rub with my thumb.</p> <p>I slipped a second finger in before pressing firmly against her clit with my thumb, causing her to squirm even more. Her hands flew open to press against the wall, and I pressed my fingers into her with all my strength as I continued to rub her clit. Her breath began to rush out in gasps, and her hips rolled and thrust as though trying to force my fingers into her.</p> <p>She let out what felt like a scream, and I almost couldn't breathe. I slid two fingers in her as the first wave of orgasm crashed over her. She was panting like a mad woman, and I continued to rub her clit until she finally collapsed onto my lap.</p> <p>She looked at me, a little dazed and almost in a daze, and I smiled. She lay there with my fingers still buried in her cunt, her eyes still closed. My own eyes were closed too, but I could see the strain of her chest beneath the light and smell of sweat that had come into some sort of haze on the humid night.</p> <p>She reached down and held my hand.</p> <p>"Oh my goodness," she said. "You...you always seem so...so...so..."</p> <p>She had a shocked look on her face. She looked down at herself, her arms still around my neck and her legs in a bunch, and began to cry. I held her while she cried, holding her as she collapsed onto my chest with her head against mine, her arms wrapped tightly around my neck.</p> <p>"I..."</p> <p>"It's okay, honey," I said, soothingly. "It's all right. It's okay. I'm OK."</p> <p>She didn't answer, and I think her next words were to try and find a way to tell me that everything was perfect.</p> <p>"I'm okay," she said again, her voice choked out with tears. "You really are...I didn't think you were capable of that. You're the best."</p> <p>I smiled to myself, realizing I was in complete agreement. She was indeed one of my best lovers. And she was truly in love with me. I looked over at the clock. It was about midnight and we had been through a lot already today. She had barely got off of me before I came again.</p> <p>"I'll be back," I said. "I promise. You keep touching me like this all night and I'll be back in an hour and I'll...I'll be good."</p> <p>Chapter 2</p> <p>I woke up still lying on the bed with Jane, still wrapped by my arms, my fingers in her cunt and clit. When I rolled off of her she smiled and wiggled her ass in my wake, then turned over and sat up. I moved over with her and put my arm around her waist. She turned so that her face rested on my chest and her hand snaked around my neck to pull me closer to her, her eyes glistening with happiness and fear.</p> <p>"Oh my goodness, honey, I know it probably isn't possible to trust you, but..."</p> <p>"I love you," she murmured against my skin.</p> <p>"I love you, too."</p> <p>She fell into my arms and my hands moved down to find her ass. We sat there, kissing and holding each other. Just one look out of ten, I suddenly thought. One look at five feet away.</p> <p>"Where's your car?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Oh, it's just back in the parking lot," she said. "It's pretty late in the day. We just got back from a trip over here."</p> <p>"Let go. You can keep up your end of the bargain," I said, knowing she would keep up her end of the bargain at the minute.</p> <p>"You're right. Of course I can't," she said. "It's just so...so..."</p> <p>"Let it happen. Let all that pain and worry go and have fun. How about tomorrow night? We can go out for dinner, hang out in my apartment. We can hang out in your place."</p> <p>"You're right," she said, smiling happily. "I love it.
