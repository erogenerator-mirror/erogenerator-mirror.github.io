She obeyed, not resisting as he ran his hands up and down her thighs, squeezing them lightly as he kissed them gently. She let herself be used for his pleasure, feeling a twinge of jealousy of her own. She imagined him taking the time to please, and to enjoy the feel of her smooth, hot flesh on his lips and tongue. But as her orgasm was looming, she realized that she actually loved it. Her body shook, and her legs shook under him. But despite her body's reaction, she found it hard to tell that she needed that orgasm, not even with her own hands, which had been clamped around his cock.</p> <p>He was the same. He knew what would feel good to her. His hands traveled further, fingers moving to her ass and gently pinching it. She moaned, as his mouth covered her pussy and she felt her whole body quivering. He looked up at her, watching her eyes, which were closed, and saw the look of passion in them.</p> <p>"God...that was sooooo..." She stammered, her mouth not able to finish. He kissed and licked her pussy, making her whole body jump again. But he only broke their kiss, and went to work on her breasts. He kneaded her full breasts, feeling her hard nipples in his fingers as his mouth sucked them. They were not soft, and he just made her cry with pleasure to feel him.</p> <p>"Do you feel my...d...d...fuckin' cock?" he asked, moving between her legs, which had seemed so tight as he held them.</p> <p>"Yes," she gasped. "God, yes!"</p> <p>Her lips quivered around his cock, as he continued sucking on her cunt. He looked down at it, seeing the full length of it. It filled his eyes. He looked at his cock, and was overcome with desire. The smell of her flesh filled his nostrils; the scent of sex. His tongue licked her lips, and she felt herself arching upwards to meet him. He bent over, his lips finding her sex again, and began devouring her, tongue penetrating her vagina as her body twisted and bucked under him.</p> <p>As he ate her, he could not help but feel her breasts under his hands, as they bounced up and down. Her nipples were like hard diamonds and her breasts were beautiful. He could smell, feel how their skin felt against him when he sucked on them. He slid two fingers inside her, just to the first joint before pressing in further. She was moaning again as her eyes closed, and her head dropped from side-to-side. Her body rocked on the bed, her legs spread wider than before. She threw her head back, and moaned, as he licked and sucked on her. Her hands were in his hair, and she could feel herself riding the waves, enjoying the pleasure his mouth and tongue were giving her.</p> <p>"God, that feels good!" she cried, as a wave of ecstasy filled her body. She closed her eyes, then opened them, to watch him, to see him eating her. She had thought they were done in the moment, but now she was looking at the cock between her legs, where he was thrusting and pumping into her, as he drank on her, feeling her body being turned on by the pleasure he was giving her. His face became impassive, as he looked at the two women on the bed, enjoying their first orgasm. What was wrong with her? Why was it wrong with her?</p> <p>"Cum for me, babygirl," he whispered, kissing her ear. She looked at the clock on the side wall, saw it on the other side, and smiled at the time. She had been ready for him for hours, and she had only been through one climax. She had been ready to cum for hours and had nothing to stop him. "Cum babygirl...cum for me!"</p> <p>Her body shuddered again, and she cried out, as he continued sucking on her clit, and she came again, again. How much it made him feel...it was enough...she had done it! She had finally been able to cum. He looked at her face, her eyes closed, and his hand held the base of his cock, waiting for her. She opened her eyes briefly. One hand was in his hair again, caressing it as she looked at him. "Cum," he said, licking her lips and licking her mouth again.</p> <p>She was ready...he still needed more. He pulled out a bottle of lube from the bedside table, and handed it to her. She put it on her fingers, then touched herself. "Wash it," he said. She handed it to him. His smile was as wide as his eyes.
