If anyone could do it, it's me!</p> <p>I pulled back the curtain to check up on my sister again. She seemed to be settling in nicely, but I wanted to say something more, to try to remind her a little. I opened my legs a little, and spread them wider. I had my left foot planted up on the side of the tub. This gave me even more room. My legs were open as I began to lean back. A bit more of the water ran down my sides as well as under the water and pooling on the sides.</p> <p>I leaned back and began to massage out the water. I had a lot of it in back, so there were plenty of spots to rub out my back. I took the washcloth from the side of the tub and wiped some of the water up, then began to rub it down my front. This was becoming my job and I was glad it lasted! But I was getting into something and before long, my fingers were massaging my boobs. I knew if I was leaning back, my legs wouldn't stilled. But that would be too quick for someone that I was so into!</p> <p>As I rubbed and rubbed, I pulled back on the soap, and continued to work the soap over my breasts. It was so erotic to have my tits rubbing into someone's hands! I had never thought getting into bondage had me so turned on. They were a little bigger than mine, and they felt nice in my hands, but not overly so. They felt good too. I took the washcloth and rubbed back my hair, then my shoulder blades, back to my shoulders. Then back up it went.</p> <p>When I got to my tits, I was so excited I had to play with them some more. I kept working the soap over me, then down my front, then back up. I stopped washing myself and moved out of the hot tub. I started to dry myself with a towel but couldn't reach it. I looked down at the mirror and had to stop before I opened it. I was completely nude! What the hell was wrong with me?</p> <p>I was standing at the sink drying my hair and I was looking at myself. I was so turned on that I wanted to have a quick wash. I looked around and didn't see anything I liked. Then I realized that it was a little more than I would have thought. I took the towel and began to dry my hair. It was still a little wet, but the towel was clean enough. I finished drying my hair and got back into the tub. I pulled the cover up, and sat again.</p> <p>I opened the towel, and put it back down. I got out of the tub and dried my pussy hair. I finished my hair off, and turned off the light. I went straight for my toothbrush. I began to play with my pussy and as soon as it was cleaned, I turned off the light. As I sat down, I put back on my cover-up, then sat again.</p> <p>There was no mistaking who was who. It was both of us, except for my sister. I knew from her eyes when someone would look at me that her sister was now looking at me like that. The two of them seemed to be getting closer.</p> <p>"Don't tell me that you want to be a lesbian?" I ask her.</p> <p>"Well, no!" she answers, sounding as if she was going to say something more at any time. "I just want to be with a man, like you."</p> <p>"So how does that work?" I asked.</p> <p>"When you have sex with another woman, it can get pretty intense. A lot of the things you can do, there is actually only one way."</p> <p>"And what does that one way involve?"</p> <p>"Well, you can't really have sex with the same woman twice."</p> <p>"Not that I know of, but some people like to have sex with other woman, even just one. Are you sure you're okay with that?"</p> <p>"I'm not really sure, I had no idea, until now. I'm not sure how to act around women. I don't want to lose it with you!"</p> <p>"Then how about you not having sex with the same woman again?"</p> <p>"I don't think that will be a problem. If I had sex with someone else again, the idea of sex again with another woman just doesn't seem that easy. And with both of you as my 'partners'. You could make some really great friends, even if you didn't think that I would do it."</p> <p>"It sounds great! You were just talking to me, so I'm sure it's more than just chatting about anything. It's not like either of us are lesbianâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
