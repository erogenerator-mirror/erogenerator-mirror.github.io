His hands are locked either side of the small black leather couch, just above the middle of it, and I notice him shifting his weight back and forth and moving his knees slightly apart while slowly humping the air. I can also hear him groaning low in his throat, so I know he's doing the same thing to me that we were doing last night.</p> <p>He's fucking me faster and faster, but it's clear that that isn't going to make the movie any less interesting than last night. I feel the pressure building inside of me, and feel his cock getting more forceful every time he comes up for air, until he suddenly explodes inside of me and falls forward onto me, both of us panting.</p> <p>Finally, we find ourselves on our feet, breathing deeply and trying to keep our composure, while we look around the room.</p> <p>"Honey, there's nothing we can do for you...it wouldn't be right to let it ruin this," he says with a laugh.</p> <p>"Not even to tell someone?"

"Okay, I'm not saying how I feel about this, but I don't want you to feel bad either. And you're right, it's wrong. Let's just give in."</p> <p>I nod and turn to the group. "Thanks guys. Maybe our friend Mike will come through after a while. Come on, let's get a drink...we're going to order some pizzas nowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
