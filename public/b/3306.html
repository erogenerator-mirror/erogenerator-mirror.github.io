I just want you two to catch this flight; it'll get us down there and up to your rooms. I mean, right now. It's still pretty early. I guess we should eat first, too." She took my hand, and led me around the room. We had a small fire pit on the floor, and the dining table was in a circle.</p> <p>"Wow, this is amazing...I haven't been this excited in ages. I really think we could have been doing this for twenty years instead of forty or so."</p> <p>"Maybe not too," I said, "but we've got to get a hotel room in town and buy a couple of blankets. They're really comfortable, even if you don't use them."</p> <p>Celina's expression shifted to something closer to curiosity. "Wow," she whispered, "what kind of hotel are we supposed to be staying in."</p> <p>"Well, I've heard they cater to a range of interests, as long as they don't make the hotel look too large."</p> <p>"Wow," she said again with a smile, "let's see if we can get in on that list." She leaned over and kissed me, and then pulled back with a wicked grin.</p> <p>We ate our first-ever, and we made good time. We got up to our room, had a shower together, brushed, etc. I took them both to bed in their room early, and we did it all again. Finally, Celina told me to make us up a fresh couple of blankets.</p> <p>"You sure know how to make us feel good, baby," she said when we were inside.</p> <p>After we made breakfast together on the bed, we got in the shower and talked. Celina was already dressed and ready for her flight when we finally got out. There was no one else in the apartment except the two of us, and we were soon lying face-to-face in water, naked and giggling like crazy.</p> <p>"There's no need for clothes in here...this is gorgeous!" she giggled. "And I feel so relaxed now... I've never been with anyone with such ease and energy... it's beautiful."</p> <p>"Yeah," I agreed, "I like being naked with you." I looked at her eyes, and she smiled. "You're such a beautiful woman, and yet so different. I feel happy and secure about it all."</p> <p>Celina leaned her lips on mine, and began kissing me, and soon the kisses were deeper, and sensual than the first. Celina's mouth opened, and her tongue darted lightly into my mouth. "Mmmmmmm," she cooed, "this is making me so hot, just thinking about you here in the shower."</p> <p>I cupped Celina's ass, and she pushed it up into me. Our bodies were slick with the water, and she slipped her hands under my arms to cup and knead my breasts. She pinched my nipples gently, and they responded with more blood than they had done before. Soon, we were kissing again, with me stroking Celina's face. Celina pulled me back against her, and we ground against each other.</p> <p>"You're getting me really wet, sweetie," she whispered as we kissed.</p> <p>Our hands made their way to each other's bodies, and soon we were caressing and caressing each other in a way that I'd never done before. Celina's lips and fingers were all over my nipples, and I could just see them poking through her hands. At the same time, my hands slid down to Celina's waist, and I slipped one hand under her and pulled her body toward mine.</p> <p>I slid my thumb down its path to Celina's clit, which it had so recently discovered, and she cooed as I rubbed her gently. Our bodies got even closer together, and our kisses became deeper and more passionate. Celina's body began to writhe on mine, and I took her bottom lip between mine, and felt her move in my arms. We broke our kiss, and stared into the other's eyes as our tongues continued to caress each other.</p> <p>"Come here, lover," Celina whispered, "I want us to do this another time."</p> <p>I let my hands slide up her body, and I reached for her face, and pulled her toward me, and she willingly fell to the bed. Once there, we traded kisses, and I moved up her body, and my mouth met hers. I felt our naked bodies pressing together, our lips parted, our tongues dancing. I could feel Celina's arousal, her body felt different from mine, and I could feel her heart rate increasing. I could feel our bodies working against each other, and a sudden wave of desire overtookâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
