She was a model when it was a hobby and worked so hard to be young, when a few days ago he took her on a tour of a very popular shopping centre. I can't believe that I'd miss watching him walk towards me. He took her on a plane to New York and then to Hawaii for a few weeks." Heather sat there quietly. When I moved closer to her and held her hand, she looked up at me, almost as if she was about to cry. I was about to turn her around and say something until I caught myself. I was shocked. "Heather you are amazing. Never had a man before...no, I mean it's not like an orgy but just something. How do you feel?"</p> <p>"Well thank you for the compliment I was hoping you would say that." Heather replied as she stroked my hand with her thumb. I didn't think she felt at all bad. She was looking me right in the eye and she saw right through me, I mean, she was still just an eighteen year old virgin so I'm not the first guy I went out with in that area. She looked at me funny. "What, did I do something wrong?"</p> <p>"No, you really are a very beautiful girl. Heather, you're really cute." She had been in the same place, right there on my lap, right in front of me, but she had been in front of me longer than I had thought. I turned my eye back to Heather and saw that she was biting her lip. "I can't believe it's true." But then she gave up, looking away shyly. She had never acted this way towards me and I was sure that she was feeling guilty, but I wouldn't have thought that out. When I had gotten her to let go of my hand, there was an instant change in her eyes and she suddenly looked at me very seriously.</p> <p>"How was it?" I asked her. She just looked back at me, a little hurt.</p> <p>She looked up quickly, and said, "It was amazing. I was really scared but I wanted this to be a night that I would only see a movie at home and never have a man in my life. I was so nervous, I couldn't believe how much I liked it."</p> <p>"Really?" I could see that look of determination in her eyes, she was feeling excited about getting drunk and all.</p> <p>"Yeah, it just made me feel so much better being with you." She smiled up at me, as she continued to rub my hand. "I don't know why, but I never thought I'd end up this way." She said with that voice again.</p> <p>I felt my own lips start to tingle.</p> <p>"Honey, why have you never said anything like that before, before, before you asked me to marry you?"</p> <p>"Well, it's just happened so fast. I've thought about asking for that, but..."</p> <p>"But what? I really don't understand."</p> <p>"I think it was a big mistake, and I don't want it to be a mistake. I don't want to be a bad person. I've made a lot of mistakes and I have had an emotional breakdown and I'm not sure I can handle that just now." Her voice was light and her look scared. All she said was "Honey, I don't want to make you feel bad about trying, it's just that I think you are beautiful." With that she reached up and stroked my cheek, her voice soft and so sincere. "That just made me feel good. I know that I have probably told you a lot in a minute and I really feel like I have to say something to you."</p> <p>I put my arm around her as she stroked my face. Her cheek was warm and soft, yet it was the kind of warmth that went right through my body, where the lightest brush of her fingers would send shivers up my spine. After a while she got up to go to the bathroom, which was right on the other side of the room. When she came back, she sat down on the edge of the bed, facing me. I sat there not knowing what to say, just staring at her.</p> <p>"Did it really happen?" She asked me.</p> <p>"Yeah, so did I." I replied.</p> <p>She continued to look at me, almost like she was trying to come across as nervous, but with just a slight nod.</p> <p>"Are you feeling better now?"</p> <p>"Yeah, just a little bit. I just know that... I'm feeling a little nervous, but..." I didn't know how to explain that as I stared into her amazing eyes. "Oh you're amazing, you're just amazing. Your eyes look so beautiful."</p> <p>"I just wanted thisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
