You don’t seem to understand.”</p> <p>“I know nothing about you,” I said, laughing.</p> <p>She moved her hands and began to caress my arms. “I just hope the massage continues as well. I like how you take me.” She kissed me and I felt the heat of her loins as her hand stroked along my back.</p> <p>As she began to move her hands along my shoulders, I reached around her and ran my fingers along her ass. I was very pleased by her movements, and I wondered if we’d get to know each other.</p> <p>We broke the embrace and she pulled my shirt off, then lay back down on the bed. I took off my shirt and she began to take off my shorts. When I stood naked beside the bed we embraced and were locked in a 69 when she pushed me back onto the bed. Her mouth was on my crotch, licking my cock and balls while her ass rubbed against my ass.</p> <p>I was loving every minute of my sexual torment. I couldn’t last much longer as my cock was becoming more and more stiff. She was on her back between my legs sucking my balls into her mouth when I felt her hands caressing my ass. I pulled myself apart a little and got a better idea. I was sure there was no going back for this.</p> <p>I moved myself over her hips and let my cock slide home into the warm, slick sheath of her pussy. Our pelvises rubbed together as I moved in and out. She moaned softly and began to massage her breasts.</p> <p>“Oh, God you feel so good.” I said through gritted teeth.” Your cock feels so good. Feels good too. It’s so tight. I love it when you do that,” she said as she reached down and cupped my sac in her palm. I felt her fingers on my cock and a finger on my anus. Her hand slid up and down my shaft, up and down with long, slow strokes.</p> <p>I couldn’t hold on any longer. My balls were ready to shoot and I was afraid I wouldn’t be able to stop it. The pressure built for what seemed like an eternity. I grabbed the back of her thighs and pulled her back as far to get as much depth into her vagina as possible. I felt the pulsing of my cock inside her and I held on to her until my cock began to spasm. I was ready to fill her with cum but I also wanted a little taste. I pulled her hips up so I could lick her pussy and clit as I continued to thrust into her. I got to her clit as my tongue flicked it over and over.”</p> <p>I licked her pussy as her hand began to stroke my cock for all it was worth. She seemed to enjoy it too as the intensity of the feelings grew. I moved two fingers in and out of her pussy and played with her anus. It was as if we were in some sort of sexual contest to see who could stay hard until we came. I could feel my orgasm starting to build.”</p> <p>I began to cum. She felt my cum pulse into her and she stroked me faster as I filled her. I slid my cock out as cum spattered across her breasts. She lay there breathing hard. “I think there’s some left. I feel good too.”</p> <p>I rolled myself off her and found her feet. We climbed from our hot bed and went to the bathroom for more sex. I made a mess in the huge shower and helped her wash her hair. We had a good time, but she stayed in bed. We dressed as the others went out. I had no idea what I wanted to do today. The sun was bright as it washed the deck and the house out. I had a hard time getting up but managed. “I can’t believe we have to do this again.” I said. “It’s been a fantastic sex affair.”</p> <p>“We are going to do it again and again, and again.”</p> <p>She giggled. “I’m going to keep it up and keep my hands off your cock. I wouldn’t want to embarrass you. I liked the feeling of you in my mouth and pussy.”</p> <p>“I’ll take that as a 'yes' if you let me fuck your ass as well, if you can just do me for a while longer. Maybe after the game.”—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
