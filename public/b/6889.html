And if you look back, we'll tell you that it was wonderful."</p> <p>She kissed me again. "Thank you. I love your cock."</p> <p>"We have a whole month to enjoy the trip," I said. Now she seemed to be more interested in the possibility of another round of sex, which made me feel like I had taken a step way. I was really horny and thought I was going to explode.</p> <p>"I think we'll start a little at the spa," she said as she put her robe on and disappeared into the wash room. When she came back she looked spectacular. She smiled when she saw me. She was wearing a sexy black and red lace bra and matching panties. In the bathrobe she looked spectacular, as were her fabulous legs. And she was totally naked under the robe.</p> <p>"Honey, you're beautiful, you've got to have some sex," I said as I took her in my arms and kissed her passionately. She responded, with enthusiasm.</p> <p>After we kissed for several minutes she came out of the washroom and I said, "Honey, this isn't all a one time thing. I'll be honest, I will be open to other men."</p> <p>"Okay" she said. "But, if you'll show me what you have in mind, I'll be as open as you are. I'd love to see your cock."</p> <p>I looked at her. "Would you show me what you have in mind?"</p> <p>"Well, honey," she asked. "I've been wanting to see you since you started flirting with me a week ago. I haven't even gotten to the part about your cock, but I promise I will tell you something special. I want you to think about my fantasy, then come out here and put on an outrageous outfit. For example take off all your clothes right now and I'll show you my naked body."</p> <p>I turned to her and said, "Go for it."</p> <p>She turned away and removed all her clothes. She looked like a vision of erotic beauty. I looked at her perfect ass which was very pronounced and her shapely legs which looked perfect through the robe, which were very shapely. All the while she was talking to me she was looking at my cock which was already semi-hard. She was still so wet from the bath and the kissing.</p> <p>"I'm ready," she said as she kissed me again. "See if you can get it hard."</p> <p>I went in the bedroom where I found some sexy lingerie. Under the clothes I had already been thinking to get her to have the ultimate fantasy. What I didn't expect, was the sheer blouse top that showed her cleavage perfectly. It was short and did about four inches or so.</p> <p>"Honey, I like those with a bra, it's sexy," I said as I took the top and slipped it over her head. I loved the way it showed just a hint of her gorgeous breasts. She looked so hot.</p> <p>"I love that, so I put it on this nice day, would you like to take a look now?" She gave me a quick peck on the cheek.</p> <p>"Just to show you how it looks on me," I said.</p> <p>She turned and was wearing a short skirt that came all the way down to just over her hips.</p> <p>"You look so sexy!" I said.</p> <p>"I'm glad you like me, my boyfriend likes you that much," she said.</p> <p>I asked her to lift her arm. I pulled the skirt back and as she did her breasts swayed deliciously.</p> <p>"Wow, you have a great body!" I said.</p> <p>"I'm glad that you love it so much. But I think we'll go slow and not rush too much."</p> <p>"But you'll want to get to know me and you will want to see what is really important so go slow!"</p> <p>"Honey, this is all a one time thing, I'll think about it and see what happens," I said.</p> <p>"I guess I know," she said. "But don't forget, as part of our relationship, you need to ask me to go slow to come out for one more time. I promise I'll do my best to let you know when the time is right."</p> <p>"Okay, you'll be right back and I'll be right here waiting for you."</p> <p>I left the bedroom and went to my living room to do some painting. I hadn't been out all day and really wanted to get some time with her and have some fun with her. I was feeling a little out of place with all the flaunting and talkingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
