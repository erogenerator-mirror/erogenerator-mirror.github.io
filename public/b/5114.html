We both said at the same time. It all seemed so strange. Maybe I shouldn't have agreed to go that far, but this girl just seemed so...real. "But, what about tomorrow? How do we tell everyone I'm yours?" I couldn't help but ask.</p> <p>"Well...I've got a nice surprise for you," she smiled. "You'll love it." I nodded. And I thought it was going to be a night I would not soon forget.</p> <p>******************</p> <p>A little after five the next morning we decided to take a shower together. I wasn't wearing one. I guess I was always too embarrassed to do that, as soon as I put my clothes away I knew I would not be going anywhere without my "wedding present" again. I soaped up my body carefully and I couldn't help but think of how it would feel to have my body pressed against hers. After a few seconds I made sure my dick was totally shaved clean.</p> <p>I washed my hair for a second and then stepped out with a fresh handful of shampoo and a towel in hand. Standing under the shower head I carefully washed my hair, then my chest, and finally my back. "There!" I exclaimed. Turning the water off I stepped out and dried off. Taking my time, I carefully applied the conditioner to my cock head and then back to the mirror.</p> <p>My first thoughts were about the "how this should" thing go. It seems more natural. I'm not sure if it should ever end. The first thing I'd do is start the shower up and go into the bedroom and get out my "wedding present". My mind had been trying to be all straight. I wanted to make sure it was going to be for me...and her. "But what would we do in there?" I though. I didn't feel right putting it off to talk. But then again this "dressing up" thing sounded a little more plausible as I thought to myself what could go wrong if I asked if there were any rules that said things were to be kept strictly off-limits. It seemed like a good time to consider it.</p> <p>I stepped out, wrapped my towel around me and put on some soft silk boxers. Stepping out and getting in the shower was almost as dramatic as going out in public. The warm water felt so good! It was almost too much. I couldn't bring myself to think about anything except her touch.</p> <p>I let the water wash over my face and body for a little while before I stepped out with a towel. "Good morning," I said, drying my hair as I came over.</p> <p>She didn't respond. I'd been trying to picture what her beautiful body looked like, but didn't have the nerve for all the talk I was having about sex. It seemed like she hadn't spoken because I was having a hard time thinking of anything to say. Finally she came back into the bathroom and stepped into the shower stall, putting her hands on my chest and rubbing her body against mine.</p> <p>"Good morning, honey." She said softly.</p> <p>"Good morning." I replied with a smile.</p> <p>"I'm so glad you said we would go shopping today," she said.</p> <p>We washed each other thoroughly and rinsed the soap off one other before walking out to the hot tub. She didn't bother with her robes. She had on a night gown and the bathrobe. I don't know how I could have let her, as I didn't even really want to know...for that matter. I just kept thinking of her and this wonderful body...and then my mind came back to the plan to go shopping today. "Let's start by going shopping." My mind began to wander back to thinking about what might be done in the bedroom. I wasn't sure how we might do it. She was so beautiful to think about, but she looked so real too.</p> <p>As ordered we got into the hot tub and got submerged. Then we got out and started drying one another. I didn't bother putting on any of her underwear. It felt too casual. It wasn't too sexy to just slip in the robe out a second after I slid in.</p> <p>When we got out of the tub and she turned to dry my cock she was smiling. "Why don't we do this for a minute?" she suggested. I just smiled and nodded.</p> <p>"Good!" she said. She opened the robe and handed it to me. She stepped in. "Just do what I tell you."</p> <p>I took hers out, pulled her robe up and we walked to the bedroom and went, "Do your thing," I thought. She got in next to me and pressed her body into mine...and my cock started to come back toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
