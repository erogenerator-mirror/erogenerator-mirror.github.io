The girls looked up immediately as the girl came stumbling out to see the blonde kneeling before her.</p> <p>"I'm glad to be here, I have to tell you." she said, staring down the other girl.</p> <p>"Oh, come on! It's the same one as me!" the other one said with a laugh. After the girl was gone, the girl said, "Well you girls have a deal; you are going to be the next victims!"</p> <p>Everyone in the room was looking for a reason to leave the room after this little event, their heads swivelled to all directions wanting to be amongst the laughing, dancing, and giggling at the party.</p> <p>"Hey, if you get out of here right now, I'll take all of your clothes and throw them at you and you have to lick the floor clean."</p> <p>It sounded like fun, after all.</p> <p>"Hey, I was trying to be friendly and to stay out of my friend... I'm going to start getting a little frisky tonight, how long are you going to keep this up?"</p> <p>"We're just trying to keep up with the pace now."</p> <p>"Well, at least have a good time!"</p> <p>The group walked out of the office and out into the main ballroom. In the back of the room, two more girls stood under the stage. The blonde and the redhead were the only ones left out. The two of them looked about two feet away from each other, and neither girl could see anything except for a single strand of hair falling over their faces.</p> <p>The blonde was wearing heels, and the redhead a short black dress. The other girl wore black heels, the redhead wore black boots, and both the two taller girls in their heels were only barely above the top half of the stage, the only other visible to any of the people in the room below them.</p> <p>One of the girls who were closest to the blonde said, "Excuse me. How may I help you tonight."</p> <p>The redhead replied, "A pleasure, but please join us."</p> <p>The redhead looked back and forth between the two girls and said, "It looks like we can't have that, but we can stay and talk afterwards."</p> <p>The blonde then looked around the room to make sure there was no one else nearby, and asked, "Do you know where we can get some drinks?"</p> <p>"Yeah, sure," the redhead said, "I guess we can get a few to go with."</p> <p>The blonde then leaned over and grabbed their bags. "Here, you girls can have a few of those with you if you want," she said.</p> <p>Without further word, she quickly gathered them up. The shorter girl followed her lead as they entered into the backstage area.</p> <p>"There you are, can I get you these drinks?" the redhead asked, reaching into her purse. She then pulled out a bottle of Champagne and two glasses.</p> <p>"Yes!" she said, "And you too, come on, bring them back, I have some good drinks waiting." she said with a wink. "We can get some snacks with you in the meantime."</p> <p>Then she pulled a cigarette from her purse. "Hey, would you like to smoke? I don't smoke."</p> <p>"That sounds beautiful, and that's all I can say for the champagne," he replied, "So, would you like to come with me with a glass."</p> <p>"No way! I'll let you smoke there, I really don't have the energy." She reached back into her purse and pulled out a small clip-on lighter.</p> <p>They were now on a public bus, and the only seat available was in the back. They could all see the other person sitting down and could just make out the other person in the back seat. The girls could clearly smell that strong, thick smoke from between the blonde's legs.</p> <p>"Here," she said taking the lighter, "I have a lighter in my purse. It's not tobacco, but it certainly is the most reliable and harmless smoke I have. This will only take you a couple of minutes."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>She reached into her hand bag and removed a cigarette and took a puff. She handed the lighter to him.</p> <p>"I want you to take out the lighter while you smoke," she said, handing him the lighter.</p> <p>They could no sooner begin the blow job than he was on his way to take a puff and then a puff as he brought the lighter down to his own lips. His fingers went to the lighter, but they were not ready to reach out to her; they were nervous of what was to follow.</p> <p>He started to turnâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
