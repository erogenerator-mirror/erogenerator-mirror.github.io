A look in yours will bring on his desires, and that love will spread throughout their bodies as he explores you.</p> <p>He never had sex with anyone with an open mind. His sexual needs were limited to what anyone could give him. Some were a little on the wild side of sexual exploration. A lot of the women just didn't come out as adventurous in the way they did.</p> <p></p> <p>I met him at his work function and we went for dinner.</p> <p>And before our first encounter at the function he asked me about my personal situation.</p> <p>I told him what happened at home and he told me about what he did to others around the house without really knowing exactly who I was or where he went.</p> <p></p> <p>After that we talked and ate, and then went back to his room.</p> <p>His bedroom was very nice.</p> <p>He had the bed made and decorated as well as his closet as he was going to make it. He was also going to build a small garage to stock his garage. He knew how to do that at school so that when he got his own space he could always go to school. I asked him about what he did, because I was going to watch when he did it. I asked him if he didn't mind to me being in there. I didn't tell him that I would. I just thought they would have a long time to discuss it.</p> <p>I told him I would make sure he was home by late Saturday night, because next week I was going to get a visit from a friend that is really nice.</p> <p>My friend would come over to dinner and I would be there when she came home.</p> <p>I made sure it was an extra special night because I was going be fucking him.</p> <p>I said I didn't think he would want me to stay if he was going to be with a new woman.</p> <p>He laughed and said,</p> <p>"A girl is the only woman that I'm going to be having sex with tonight. And I don't think it's such a bad idea."</p> <p>I took the opportunity to tell him that it wasn't. I was just teasing him. I was never really ready to do anything about it. He laughed and said,</p> <p>"I can't imagine why not."</p> <p>When we got to his room and we were about to go to bed I was a little nervous.</p> <p>So I gave him some privacy, then I came to his side and whispered in his ear.</p> <p>I told him I wanted to do this for me. He just smiled and told me to do anything I wanted to do for him.</p> <p>I said,</p> <p>"Please, just take the night off if you're sure. I don't want to make things weird for you. I'm your friend, I do whatever you want to do. I love you very very much."</p> <p>The next morning he brought me my clothes, his favorite nightie, a nighty, and said,</p> <p>"I promise that after your shower and your morning shower I will make you do anything you want to take care of tonight."</p> <p>There was a lot of nervous laughter in my voice as I said,</p> <p>"Thank you, that means a lot to me."</p> <p>He told her he was going to start on a new business venture and was looking forward to working for him.</p> <p>My friend was also looking forward to this and was already dressed.</p> <p>He said he had told her all about us and I and he had never done anything like it before.</p> <p>With the way things were going it would be all night. We laughed as I told him.</p> <p>We went into his bedroom and laid down together. He started by kissing me and playing with my boobs. He kissed them all over before he licked them and sucked on each one in turn. After awhile he moved down and started to lick my pussy, then he started to lick my ass that he had never had the chance to do before. It didn't really feel like my ass. It was wet where it was.</p> <p>He kissed his way up to my pussy, and started to slowly lick my clit. I just laid there trying to enjoy my new lover. He kissed my pussy some more, then I took his head and put him on my pussy. I asked him to lick my ass. He did it gladly, then told me that he loved it because he knew it caused me a lot of pleasure when I had been rimmed by a real stud. I got that all right in my head as I got it, but I have always felt that when I had a lover's tongue on my hole that they just would push it in and leave me wanting more.</p> <p>As my finger danced around in my pussy I felt his tongue on my clitâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
