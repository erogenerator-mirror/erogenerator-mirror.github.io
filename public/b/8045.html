Now fuck this horny slut hard, just like your brother!"</p> <p>It wasn't long before the door opened again and a third woman joined the others in the room.</p> <p>A long black girl in a tight fitting dress stood beside my chair with the cock in her hand as the girl stroked herself.</p> <p>"Fuck! I'm cumming again!"</p> <p>"Don't stop, oh yes that's lovely, yes you wonderful slut. Don't you dare stop!"</p> <p>"That's a lovely one."</p> <p>The girl finished and the girl walked over to me. She gave a wan smile as she did and then moved my chair a little to make room for her. The girl sat back on the couch, spread her legs wide and began to run a hand over herself.</p> <p>When she had calmed down a little bit she looked at the clock to see that I had just finished and she said,</p> <p>"I'm hungry. You've got to go eat!"</p> <p>"Sure if you'd like."</p> <p>The girl smiled and got up and went to the kitchen. I just about fell over with excitement and I asked,</p> <p>"What has that got to do with your brother?"</p> <p>She explained that there was a video hidden in the refrigerator and she knew that my brother hadn't checked it.</p> <p>"You're not exactly his type, are you Lucy? Oh no! You'll enjoy it anyway."</p> <p>I'm not sure how to go about it. After we had shared one of my stories it seemed so natural and not as though I had ever really done anything. How would my brother react when she told him about our conversation? And what would his reaction then be? I still can't get that out of my head. Why did it just occur to me? Does it really matter? Is it a huge deal?</p> <p>She said,</p> <p>"Come on let's try to have a quick meal."</p> <p>I think that I could have gone through with what I had told her. There was something else that I wanted to talk to her about. I wanted to ask her what her reaction to my story might be. There is something I didn't want to talk about until it had been a while since that I had thought about.</p> <p>We went up to our room and it wasn't long before she was on her knees again again. I got behind her and began to slide my cock into her.</p> <p>"We don't have much time to make you squeal you bastard. You'll get to see real live cock for some time to come. That's the thing that gets me so excited thinking of your brother in real life with a cock that's twice as big as yours!"</p> <p>"I'll do anything you want" was her only reply.</p> <p>To Be Continuedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
