I don’t remember his name but I’ve heard it so many times before, I can’t quite place where. “Your name, I assume,” I say, I have to have it, in my head to make sense.</p> <p>I’ve been in the club for a few months, not long so far, and I’ve been staying in a bar in the centre of town, not too near to the main club but close enough that it can’t be seen by anyone without it and I can’t hide that in my mind. But I’ve left most of what I thought to be my mind behind that I keep to myself. I have no idea what my thoughts should be. They can’t possibly be so good, can They’ve only been good once!</p> <p>“I’ve never been here before.” I say, as if I’ve been told in advance.</p> <p>“It’s no big deal. In fact, I have a lot more fun here than I do here.”</p> <p>“So, are you going to be able to make it?” I say, not daring to reveal any truth.</p> <p>He looks at me, I can feel the truth in his eyes, the truth that it was his job all along. His face is sad. “I don’t know. I mean, I don’t see many people here and I’ve not taken a taxi. I could use a ride anyway. Are you sure you would like me to stay?”</p> <p>“I don’t think you should leave just yet,” I say, as if I was suggesting a ride in the late evening.</p> <p>“No,” he says, the look of despair in that look, “you should get yourself a taxi. You don’t know anyone here yet, it’s safe, so just stay there for a while if you like. OK?”</p> <p>I can feel his smile as he stands up, taking a few steps towards me before he stands abruptly again. Without saying a word we move towards each other, our lips never a word or a moment passing between us. I feel his hand cup the cheek of my bum cheek, squeezing it, his fingers sliding down and caressing the inside of my thigh. I can see his eyes, see the look that he must have on his face, and, without even lifting his head from the kiss are able to see what he has. When I move my hands to his head, I feel his long, hard cock, even through his trousers. At the same time is the thought that he must have been staring at me, in those big grey eyes, and when I did this, it felt as if he was looking at my breasts, and when I had just made that movement to expose them he had not even looked down.</p> <p>“I thought we could take lunch,” I say.</p> <p>“What?” he says, not responding to my words, not even when he puts his hands on my thighs. I don’t move, not when he takes one hand and slowly starts undoing the fastening of my skirt. For a long while, he slowly removes my skirt from my body. I can feel it slide down my legs, feel the softness of the silk as it slips past my knees. I don’t want to reveal that I now hold the secret of what is beneath my dress, but as the garment comes free I can see that it is not only naked from the waist up. My eyes are half hidden, the whole outfit is removed and it looks as if I am just lying there exposed to him. My hand moves from his neck, to his shoulders, and then down his chest, where it passes over a small patch of hair. This is it I think, the moment that is mine, when in truth, my hand caresses the outside of his chest. As I kiss him once, I feel how, like a dream, his cock presses against him and then it slides down over my thigh. Again, we are one and again he is touching me and I feel only the touch of his hand to my thigh and I just lie there, breathing heavily as if I have run a marathon.</p> <p>“We shouldn’t be doing this,” I say, in a shaky voice. I am not sure what it means or why it feels wrong to feel this way but when he lifts his face to mine again, with his tongue running over my lips, I kiss him back. My hand slips around his back and my fingers move quickly, searching for his belt—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
