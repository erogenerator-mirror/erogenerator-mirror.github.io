It doesn't make enough sense!"</p> <p>"You'll see."</p> <p>She continued on for a bit to my head; "When do we have to go back to the house to get a new DVD?"</p> <p>"We can go back to the house. It takes longer than I thought it would. And I know you're going to love all the new stuff."</p> <p>"I do."</p> <p>"Then lets get some dinner and catch a bit of TV on the way to the bar!"</p> <p>As we waited for the food to arrive we talked about the movie as it had played and about the other two. After a while we got off the table and went out to the bar to grab a few drinks as well as wine and to catch a movie. The two men we had brought earlier, both appeared to be in their mid 20's were seated at a table near the back of the room.</p> <p>I saw Jim and the other one on the sofa. Jim sat with his left arm across the back of the sofa, and his right hand was resting on one of his knees. The other man was sitting on the end edge of the sofa opposite him. On the other sofa was a man who resembled the other man. Jim smiled, and the other man smiled back.</p> <p>After some time a waiter approached, and I asked him for our drinks and to be served. The waiter nodded. I asked him for the wine, and he took it. I asked Jim and he had a quick smile and took the drink from us. He handed the waiter a twenty and I said yes. He walked away, and I told him to keep the change for another round. At that I turned to Jim and said, "This is my husband Bob, and this is his wife and a friend of ours.</p> <p>Just as the waiter was about to leave Jim said that he would like another beer to wash the taste off. I told him it was okay of course, and then I pointed out the drink I had just placed on the table. Jim asked me if I had seen the movie or a friend of mine in New York. I laughed, and told him that I had once watched it one time, and the friend had a friend she had met at New York that lived with her husband and his partner. So I had seen the movie, and had watched it with Bob. Jim said that he had and asked me how he had felt watching it. I told him it gave me a warm feeling to have him being around, and he said, "Oh, I can relate. This is a great way to start off the evening. And then you'll have more to go over with your wine."</p> <p>As I was opening my mouth for another sip of the wine I looked at Jim and asked him if he thought there was anything more I might like to drink.</p> <p>"Actually we have nothing."</p> <p>"Not without having something I want to have, too."</p> <p>"I was thinking the same thing," and I paused then added, "If you have something you want to talk about I think I'll have the beer and you want to sit with me."</p> <p>Jim said, "You know, I don't mind. It's nice to talk to a man and a friend."</p> <p>"Thank you. Would you mind if I took off some of this?"</p> <p>"Not at all," Jim answered.</p> <p>"Well, since this is a dinner conversation I would love to join you, but I'll go with you instead."</p> <p>"Okay, if you are sure."</p> <p>I took another sip of my drink, then handed the waiter my credit card so he could get some wine on the way home. And it didn't take long he was back with the glass, then he said, "You drink it just to be sure it isn't a snide comment."</p> <p>"Thanks, but I'll do a better job," and I smiled at him.</p> <p>We continued on until dinner was over, then we went our separate ways to get ready. Our conversation was pleasant and pleasant, and we agreed to meet in my room at 3:30, which is after a full hour of wine. I opened my blouse and Jim took my hand to pull me to him and we walked into my room, shedding several layers of clothing and kissing like lovers. Jim's hands touched everywhere on my body, and when he rubbed his fingers around the lips of my vagina I thought it might explode, and as his finger rubbed the moist pussy flesh I almost lost control of my body and my mind.</p> <p>As we stepped out of Jim was naked, and I was dressed in slacks and a button up, with Jim's shirt still unbuttonâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
