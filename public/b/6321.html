"If you still don't, I'm sure there is someone that can help you." I was stunned. I couldn't believe it. I knew what she did. I think my heart was in my throat.</p> <p>"Well, do you?" I asked.</p> <p>"You have no idea how big a deal that sounds," she smiled. "This is a big deal."</p> <p>I don't know what happened to me so fast, but I was suddenly surrounded by a mass of girls. They were dancing on the stage, gyrating their bodies to the beat of the music. Their bodies were everywhere, touching and touching, they both danced with their hands, and the girls had a mind of their own, touching and massaging each other in public.</p> <p>Then, I heard something, and thought there was a voice. "Hey!" one of them exclaimed, "I like that a lot." She looked at me and winked. She was smiling, but it was not a smile so much as a sneer. I'm sure that if anyone was standing above me, they would have seen an evil smile.</p> <p>"I think everybody knows you're here. I think you know someone," she said, walking in front of me. She walked right up to me, with a look at me, knowing I wasn't going to back away.</p> <p>Then she turned and walked back towards me, her back to me. I looked at her and saw the desire in those blue eyes. It was almost too much to take, it was like my body was saying, no backing down. I had to step forward and embrace her. She turned around with her tight ass right in my face. I moved my mouth slowly towards her ass. My tongue slid out of my mouth, but just brushed her crack, which turned me on more as I thought about tasting her. But right before she was about to touch me, she turned around again and came down to me. "I don't want to be on stage," she said, looking me in the eyes, "I want to sit in your lap" I smiled, "and I want to feel you in my pussy." I could see her moist pussy, she kept smiling.</p> <p>When she bent over and pulled her pants down, I started to reach for her as she had my pants down. I could hear her moaning, and I slid them down over her sexy ass, down her thighs, past her pussy and down her sexy legs. I looked to her face, but she was looking back at me, her lips still smiling. She stood there and smiled, and bent down again to pull her pants up. When she looked back to me, she stopped, looked at me in the eyes, and said, "I'm going to go." And she left the room, leaving me on the stage naked, horny and with my raging cock pointing straight up at the ceiling. She turned around and smiled again.</p> <p>I had a hard time trying to walk to the entrance. I couldn't believe I had a hard cock pointing straight up at the ceiling. My hands began to ache a little as I walked, but the sight of my erection with her sexy ass in front of me seemed to make up for it. My cock was throbbing from the excitement, and I wondered where these girls got their bodies from, but it didn't concern me. I had just gotten the chance to try and walk over there.</p> <p>My heart was pounding and my eyes were red with blood. I walked right up to the girls. "You like that?" she asked me, turning and walking in front of me. "You like what you saw?" she whispered as her face was only centimeters from mine. I tried to make eye contact, but her eye looked at my crotch. "What you want to see?" she asked again, and this time, she leaned up real close, and I was able to give her a kiss on her lips. I could feel her warm breath in my mouth, and her tongue came in my mouth, which I was not expecting at first. Then I felt her hand on my cock. She slowly started to move her hand up and down. There was such sexual energy in the air as I had just experience for the first time, and there was no mistaking what she was doing. She pulled out a pen and paper from her bra. A piece of paper, and a pen. She wrote "see this" in perfect script.</p> <p>I thought I was going to pass out when she kissed me on the lips again. And this time, she took her hand off my throbbing cock, and she gently moved her beautiful body behind me. She wrapped her arms around my neckâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
