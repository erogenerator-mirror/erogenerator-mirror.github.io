But I like the way you put your finger, when you stick it up it makes me feel real, real, real dirty. How long can we work that out?" This came from one of the few real, real, real moments I have had at a swingers' party. "I would really rather be on my back than going to the bathroom with my hands around your hips." "I love it when you do that." She grinned. "I could do that a lot." Now, I was getting an idea. I quickly removed my pants and put my penis up over the head of the tub so it would be aimed towards her face.</p> <p>"Don't be afraid, I can do this all night," she purred. She lifted her mouth to take me in, she knew the effect she was having. With my hands on the side of the tub, I stood there, she took a pillow, and used it to push me into her hot mouth. And it didn't take long before we were both moaning in harmony. It seems like half of the guests were there, and, if we went the rest of them would surely be, watching.</p> <p>"I love doing this in front of the whole town!" This was almost too much. I needed to warn her that she had me by the balls, her teeth would bite. She would go on and on, but would let one of her fingers slip down there too. She even went down her finger a little bit, or at least up, just enough to make it a little more than just a finger, and I would tell her to stop. "Are you ready?" she asked. I couldn't answer, I was afraid of breaking the speed limit. "Are all the rules, and the rules are still in effect?" I nodded yes. She removed your finger, she looked directly into my eyes. "Are we still talking about it?" Again, nodded yes. "Good. I'll call it a night for now." She grinned, kissed me on the cheek, walked toward the door, opened it, and left.</p> <p>I got out, showered and dressed, washed my hands, washed my face, and then left to get my wife's car. I sat in the front of it and waited. It took me longer to get there than a week ago. By the time I got to the office, I knew that she didn't want to go, she thought I would walk in on her getting ready. I walked in, she was sitting on a sofa, wearing a tanktop, a pair of shorts, and a short, pink, sleeveless dress. I couldn't put it down any more. She saw me and, saying, "It's been a very difficult week. I'd better just put my feet in."</p> <p>"I think we still need to talk," I said, I stood facing her.</p> <p>"I wanted to talk with you, but you left.</p> <p>"I did. I came to apologize, but I didn't mean to."</p> <p>"Why did you come here?"</p> <p>"For what it's worth I just wanted to talk. I thought I would be able to come over, but you left."</p> <p>"Not entirely. I guess it's a good thing that you leave. I did really enjoy it the other way. And I wanted to tell you that you are a very special friend to me."</p> <p>"When you came over I asked you to marry me?"</p> <p>"I was thinking the same thing right now."</p> <p>"But after what we did, you just want to give me a hug?"</p> <p>"I don't understand."</p> <p>"That's okay, I don't see any reason why I should stay, when other people come to our table."</p> <p>"What about you, where does it go from here?"</p> <p>"This," she said, putting her arms around me, "this was the most loving, loving, tender thing that I had ever done to you."</p> <p>"Are you sure you'll be okay with that?"</p> <p>"I can live with that."</p> <p>"I'm sure. I love you."</p> <p>"And I love you, and the people you are with."</p> <p>"I really love you too."</p> <p>We kissed then, a very romantic kiss, a kiss that I could not put down to anything but love. The next few weeks became longer for me, I was afraid we would break the rules. I had my life planned out, but I didn't want to go, I needed her, and she needed me. I never got back to my wife, she was a lot of things, all beautiful, beautiful, gorgeous even, beautiful, beautiful, beautifulâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
