If he wanted he could just put his arms around her and caress her and let her do the same. Instead she just looked up, not willing to give him the satisfaction of seeing such a good thing coming. When he finally kissed her again, as it sometimes was, she allowed herself to return his kiss. The kiss lingered for a moment more.</p> <p>"I love you, I hope you and I still will." He felt his love for her radiate deep in his heart and his hands rose toward her bosom once more.</p> <p>She looked up at him. Her soft brown eyes were closed but she opened them and there was a look of joy in her eyes. He leaned forward and kissed her. Again, he was surprised to receive such a gentle and loving kiss of her lips. He enjoyed for a moment the feeling of her soft soft lips on his tongue. The taste of her skin seemed to intensify his feelings of love in his body. He found a way to respond in the kiss once more. He gently took her by the sides of face and kissed her again. This time he kissed her mouth. The kiss was soft at first but after a moment of it, there was the passion that was in her. They both felt the urgency of the act. He gently pushed her down as he had kissed her but also felt her pull away. For a moment she sat there on a long bench on the opposite bank. She had a look on her face of passion. She just smiled at him.</p> <p>He thought he'd never get her out of this embrace. Her kiss was full of love. It was the opening of a good kiss from his beloved sister. She was giving him the gift of the kiss. With all of his love and commitment he felt as if he were in heaven. It was almost as if they both did it together. He leaned down to kiss her neck and shoulders. Then he went around side to her face and neck and kissed her there too. Once more they just kissed. Then he reached her soft breasts in an open mouthed kiss. As they kissed she was feeling her pussy start to get hot between her legs. He felt his hands touching her breasts. He kissed her nipples softly first one breast then the other and then the other. She responded in kind to his kisses. His hands kneaded their fullness and he rolled them around with his fingers. She sighed deeply as they kissed and she felt her pussy moisten.</p> <p>He began to move his hands down her breast. He squeezed and kneaded it. She arched her back. She arched her back so as to offer more room for the kisses. He felt her nipples harden as he moved his hands over them and he touched her with the warmest love in his heart. She was so soft and so warm. He was feeling the warmth of her skin in his hands. He enjoyed touching her and kissing her but it still felt so wonderful to be with her in this way. Her eyes opened and he saw her face again. This time her eyes were closed as she had closed them when this kiss would be on her bosom. When her eyes reopened he saw her smiling. Her eyes were shining with that same soft smile of her sister that had shown him the passion of their love.</p> <p>He began to kiss her again and he felt her legs tighten as he kissed her. She was getting warmer.</p> <p>"Aahh..." She had let loose of herself when he kissed her breast but she had made no move to stop him. He kissed her more and let his tongue trail slowly over her skin then moved his hot lips to her nipple. He took the little nipple and caressed it with his mouth. It quickly grew as he softly sucked on it and let it go. Her body began to quiver for he felt the warm softness of her pussy. It excited his heart to see the love of her this way. He caressed her flesh with his tongue. She opened her legs up as the lips of her pussy opened up to him. He felt the wetness of it, tasted it and tasted it again. He kissed the opening to her pussy lips, then moved his head.</p> <p>"Aah!" She felt her body react to his licking of her pussy. She parted her legs to invite him deeper into her with her legs still spread. He was licking her. He loved the taste of her pussy for her. His tongue was wet and smooth with a natural sweetness. It felt good to him. Her pussy and the taste of her flesh on his tongue were wonderful. He held back his tongue so as to wait for her to react to it. She looked down at him, her eyes wide and shining with her love. "Kiss me, kiss me...kiss me, kiss my pussy...kiss it...kiss my clitoris..."</p> <p>That was what he was waiting for. He let his tongue outâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
