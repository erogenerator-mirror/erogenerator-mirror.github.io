Her smile was broad and welcoming, but her body language had changed. The fear and apprehension he'd felt before had been replaced with a fierce confidence. Was this just a test of her worthiness?</p> <p>"Are you ready?" he asked. Her eyes had gone a deep grey while her mouth remained tight. She nodded once and he lifted her into his arms gently, careful not to crush her like he knew she was fragile. He carried her with slow, easy strokes and rested her on a padded soft pillow then lay beside her, stroking her hair. She reached down with both hands, cupped his face and kissed him. He kissed her back, then pulled her body to him so that he could hug her properly and hold her, kiss her, hug her as she held him while she rested on his shoulder. He was hard, she could feel it press against her, his arms wrapped around his body. With her head down on his chest she held him tightly.</p> <p>"You're so beautiful..." he whispered quietly. The sound had caused her to gasp with surprise and he smiled.</p> <p>"Thank you."</p> <p>He held her and stroked over her back, arms then. "You make my chest feel so wonderful," he said into her hair. "Your skin is so soft and warm," he whispered and nibbled on her ear. She shivered. "So soft, in my arms," he said, continuing his gentle stroking and he felt her body tighten in response to his words.</p> <p>Finally, his fingers left her, and her head lay along his chest. He kissed her face and neck, then his fingers moved over her body again. He pressed two fingers through her pussy, and her body responded, arching into him as she lifted her body up against him.</p> <p>His fingers brushed her pussy hair and he felt her hips raise and he pressed two fingers into her once more. He felt her body quiver in response and he was pleased that she'd let him play with her.</p> <p>She was his now, but now he knew that he could always use her again. Sooner rather than later. She might not want to lose him. He wasn't surprised that he had enjoyed himself today immensely. He wanted to show her he was more than just a guy. He wanted her to be his own little slut, so she could stay in control while he was away. That was the problem. The idea of being his mistress grew stronger with each day. Would she want him to be able to do that with her when he returned?</p> <p>He felt her relax a little and he smiled to himself as she leaned back just a little, making her body press harder against him. He ran his fingers over her breasts and she moved against him with a grin. He took his fingers away and lifted her to straddle him. She reached down for his hardness and began to stroke it through their clothes. He laughed and she slid off and reached for it, pulling back and showing him her face. "I was hungry," she said with a smile.</p> <p>"Yes you were," he said. "You're too hot to be out at sea for long." After she'd worked him through a couple of strokes, he said, "No, that was enough." He felt her smile again and began to unbutton and open his shirt. Buttons were the furthest thing from his mind. She was his now and he loved it.</p> <p>"Wait," he said and stood up. "Stand up there."</p> <p>She stood, facing him, hands on her waist and faced away. "It's not as if I have all this to take." His hands moved behind her and he felt her soft ass under his fingertips. "Do what feels good with other women, just as it's my duty to do what it's comfortable to please them when they've had some training," he said and ran his hand across her ass now.</p> <p>"You're always so gentle with me." She moved behind him and pressed the heel of her hand against his ass as she pushed him gently forward and onto the pillow. His cock was at the ready and she pulled him toward her and rubbed him over her ass cheek. "Is that what you really want?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes, yes, I do," he said. He turned slightly toward her as his hands slid down her legs. He felt the warmth and softness of her legs against his body for just a moment and then moved himself down to her knees. "I can't wait much longer."</p> <p>She pressed back against him as he lifted her and they took turns licking and kissing each other. He kissed and touched her, tasting her with his tongue and lips before he entered her, lifting her as he lowered her. His cock slipped in and out of her and then he began to fuck her with it again.
