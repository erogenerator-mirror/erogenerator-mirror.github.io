You should know," she said as she kissed me deeply. I was lost in her kiss and didn't hear the man on the other side ask to come inside and watch us.</p> <p>In a couple of minutes, she saw her friend who would have been at the end of a line for the other girl and led me into the hotel room as my eyes focused on her.</p> <p>"Nice!" she exclaimed with a bright smile. "Do you know where the bathroom is?"</p> <p>"Oh, I don't." I answered, not wanting to leave her with a disappointed look on her face.</p> <p>She got up off her feet and went to the far end of the room.</p> <p>"Have you ever done it before?" she asked.</p> <p>"No." I answered.</p> <p>"Well what about this?" she reached down and handed me a large, black, full-length wash cloth.</p> <p>I followed her instructions and washed a big part of the cloth and handed it to her and sat down in a nearby chair.</p> <p>"There! Just like that," she said as she placed the wash cloth over my cock and started stroking it.</p> <p>"Oooooh, that feels good," I stammered.</p> <p>I couldn't believe my luck. A woman my age for nearly five months had the nerve to actually give me a blow-job, in a room next to my own, on Saturday night, when I was alone!</p> <p>"Oh," I said, as she continued to stroke my cock. "I can't believe it. This is really the best thing to ever happen to me," I said, as I sat there mesmerized while she worked on me.</p> <p>There was also a huge smile on her face.</p> <p>"Is this the right guy for you?" she asked, a little smile curling on her lips.</p> <p>"Yeah," I said in a shaky voice.</p> <p>"Oh, you feel good don't ya?" she said, rubbing me with the wash cloth and kissing and licking down my chest, belly and legs, then worked her way to the head of my dick and took me in her hand and started stroking me up and down.</p> <p>"Hmmmm, you've been such a good boy." She said, in her soft voice. She then started kissing and licking her way down my stomach. "Is that a good boy for you, Dave?"</p> <p>My eyes rolled back into my head.</p> <p>"Oh yeah," she said as she reached my dick and started stroking it with her tongue.</p> <p>My eyes rolled back into me again. This was so incredible!</p> <p>"Hmmm, that's good. Just let it happen." She said. "I'll be right back."</p> <p>I could barely contain myself but I was glad we had brought a vibrator with usâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
