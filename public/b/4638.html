Do you like the feeling of those fingers in your pussy, my dear?" she asked. After hearing this, a sense of relief began to sweep through her body.</p> <p>She shook her head no, knowing that, if she wanted to continue on, then she was going to have to do as she was told. She nodded her head and moved her bottom off the bed. I followed her movement and put the tip of my dick at the opening of her tunnel.</p> <p>"You're gonna love it when I slip my cock into your pussy," I said.</p> <p>She moaned and wiggled again, moving against me, and taking me in one deep stroke. I pushed my hips forward and felt her slide against me. I held her there like that, feeling her whole body vibrate, not just the pressure of our bodies, but the pressure of our joining in a tight, hot grip that seemed to stretch around the tip of my penis. I began to rub her with both of my hands and she groaned. I loved the feel of her warm, wet body, and I pulled on her hips to make her feel all three of her holes taken by me.</p> <p>She moved faster, pushing me into the bed in the process. I had to lift my hips again in order to get all of her in me. My body began to tingle, and I felt dizzy as I felt her tunnel tighten around me.</p> <p>"I can't hold it," I said.</p> <p>I knew that if I continued, I wouldn't last long at this pace. She continued her onslaught on me even as my pace increased, her thrusts becoming more and more forceful.</p> <p>"Oh yes, do me, do me!"</p> <p>It was a deep-throated scream of pleasure and urgency as our bodies came together in a mutual orgasm. We kissed each other and fell back to the bed with her face in my shoulder. She snuggled into me as we fell asleep in each other's armsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
