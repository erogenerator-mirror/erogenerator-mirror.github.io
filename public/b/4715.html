Just wait until I get home and I'll put this in the bag.</p> <p>Once home and in bed with him, the pressure has been lifted. Maybe even a little, but you'll find that if you do anything, you'll want to keep that in mind. Just know that he'll know it and he'll love it."</p> <p>So I was glad to hear Julie mention Adam again. My pussy was wet to hear it. I didn't bother to put on the panties because I could just imagine him sliding his cock into it. I wondered if we could get him to do it once and I did want him to do it. Julie was a wonderful little vixen, very kinky and even sexier than she already was. In fact, she'd been the one who started me on to masturbate on the dance floor when Mark had come to her house. If we needed anything, she'd be right there and she wouldn't miss anything.</p> <p>The next week found us visiting her parents in their quaint little town. I was glad, as long as everything worked she could just call Adam on to her phone. She just told him to take off his clothes and sit naked on the couch. She turned the television on and the stereo on. Then she went to get some new clothes and we stopped at her old friends' place for supper. Since it was dark I thought I'd call Julie on the phone.</p> <p>"Hey, Julie. Where you been? You okay?"</p> <p>"Mark, I don't know. Just got tired of doing this and then getting home. How was your date? What were you thinking? Why do guys like you are so much fun with them? Why are you so hot that it just makes your cock hard?"</p> <p>"Oh, you're not so bad yourself."</p> <p>"Are you feeling sexy? Or do you just want more?" She laughed.</p> <p>"I don't want to answer that, but I am feeling sexy. I just thought that my date was over so I figured maybe I should try out what you have so far."</p> <p>"Well. I'd do you if you like. I have a room downstairs this evening. You can join me if you like. Mark said he had a room up by the river and a big, tree stump a ways over by the old farm house. It's really secluded and you'd have to be there to be alone. Would you like that?"</p> <p>"I think so, Julie. It's been such a short time since I've been in your bed."</p> <p>"Really" Julie purred.</p> <p>"I have you so close to me, I can almost feel you next to me."</p> <p>"I'm really getting tired of wearing your bedclothes."</p> <p>"I don't mean like you thought I might. This is my room and my bed is the one I use. I can change after we finish our dinner."</p> <p>"What did you mean? My bed, my bed?"</p> <p>"It might sound crazy for you but you're right. And if it really was your bed and I was laying on the bed with us in bed I would have. I really wasn't worried about the guys coming over as I was really enjoying it. We could even watch each other while we did. So, you've got to know. I don't care if everyone is watching us."</p> <p>"Why don't we go for a swim in the creek and cool off. We'll find out tonight what happens. I'd really like to get my fingers nice and wet."</p> <p>"There's no way those guys aren't coming over."</p> <p>"Oh, God, yes! They are going to come over now. Come on, I'm gonna make love to you."</p> <p>"Can we go in the creek first? I really need some water."</p> <p>"Yes!"</p> <p>"Yes!"</p> <p>"I need to lie down to cool off. If I jump into the creek I'm almost sure I'll be swimming all day. I want you to come sit next to me next to your bed."</p> <p>"Yes! Go ahead. Oh, I forgot. I'm not going to do that."</p> <p>"Come on, I'll jump in and we'll go for a swim. And don't jump off, I won't." She grabbed my hand and we ran off.</p> <p>We lay on my side with me behind and she was on one leg. I was behind her with my cock inside her. She was wet and I just slipped right in when we finished. Once in, then as hard as I could, I came right away. I just sort of hung there and she just held me to her.</p> <p>"Are you hard again?" She cooed.</p> <p>"I might be. Let's go for a little walkâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
