She was proud of them, and was very proud of it because she felt better sexually when she was with me. But she wasn't proud of them because they had developed over the time that I had been with her. They were perfect. They were my friend's breasts that my girlfriend would have loved to caress and kiss. She couldn't wait to take them in her mouth one of these mornings. They'd already become very sexy and aroused by the feel of their softness. As she looked into my eyes with her hands lightly touching my chest, she could feel my erect penis pressing against her thigh.</p> <p>"I'm so horny."</p> <p>She leaned closer and whispered in my ear "And I'm also very horny right now." Her breasts moved against me and I felt her nipple move against my thigh. She held onto me tighter and lifted herself up on her arms. She ran the tip of her tongue along my ear and nibbled on my earlobe.</p> <p>"That's it." she breathed. "Just kiss me there."</p> <p>I kissed her nipple between my lips and she moaned and started caressing my face with her hand while I sucked on her nipple. Her other hand was running along my side and caressing my stomach and hips. Her hand felt so good holding me in her lap and stroking me. I ran my tongue along her nipple, which really got her going and I could tell she liked feeling me sucking at her. She slid her hands down and caressed my breasts through her clothes. I moaned as her hand slipped under the silk of her blouse and started to stroke a nipple. Her blouse fell open and her breasts hung on her chest in their full nakedness, and we both moaned and groaned as she pinched and felt my breasts.</p> <p>She whispered "Let's stop." And she sat up and dropped to her knees. Her breasts were small but perfectly formed; they were perfect and sexy. My girlfriend smiled as she felt my breasts, and she looked me straight in the eye as she touched me over her shorts. I lifted myself up off of the couch and she reached down and slowly pulled her shorts down. I could feel her pussy juices on her panties where she had stroked me and she moaned as I pulled the shorts down. They fell right to the floor around her ankles. She pulled up her shirt and slowly leaned forwards to help me with them. Her breasts were now bare and I could see her nipples straining against the fabric. I couldn't tear my gaze away from her pink nipples as the thin pink fabric slid away from her. She then pulled her blouse the rest of the way off and tossed it on the coffee table. She pulled her panties off over her knees and sat down. I saw them lay next to the couch where she had sat down earlier. The panties left little to the imagination, but they were already very wet from her arousal. She ran her fingers over the fabric sliding it up and down against her pussy, before pulling away. She did it with a sly smile on her face. My heart was pounding from her touch, but her eyes were still very sexy.</p> <p>"So, if you want to start a relationship, you should take them off too. You look like you want to."</p> <p>For the second time that night the voice in my head said "Is she really serious?" Not that my brain had been able to process it. But my body had to acknowledge that I liked being naked in front of her. She was really hot.</p> <p>"Do you mind?"</p> <p>My head swam. I thought about the image of her body while she stood up and slowly stroked her breasts and nipples. Then my mind drifted back to the picture of her naked, except for her blouse on, with her tits hanging down on her as she stroked the outline of her body. I thought about the feel of her fingers on me, rubbing my body, and my own hand in hers. I didn't want to just look at her, I wanted to stare at her. The image just drew me in until my imagination took on a life of its own. My dick was so hard I could feel it. I could feel the precum dripping out of it like my erection when I watched her fingers.</p> <p>"It's OK. You don't have to ask."</p> <p>Her fingers were still sliding across her bare breasts. As I watched, her middle finger ran across one nipple. But she paused there without moving. A soft moan escaped her lips, and her hand slid further down, towards her navel. When the finger stopped just inches below her navel, a long string of wetness began to leak out of her. I felt her hands run along the edge of the robe and her knees got weak.
