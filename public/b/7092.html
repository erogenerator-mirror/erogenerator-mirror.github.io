I snapped. "You have to be kidding."</p> <p></p> <p>I watched my parents as they sat there, each just staring at each other. I got up, walking over to mom.</p> <p>"Mom, I don't think we are going to make that decision now." I said. "No way."</p> <p></p> <p>"No? Do you think we should choose to live here instead of living in the country forever?" she questioned me.</p> <p></p> <p>"Yes." I responded. "But I wouldn't let you go to bed alone if it were your decision. You can sleep where you want." She nodded.</p> <p></p> <p>"That's not so bad. Your dad has always had an amazing relationship, a stable, caring kind of relationship. So I think it feels good to spend time with you anyway. I don't want to feel too awkward about this decision."</p> <p></p> <p>"I know. But this trip is for fun, so let's just enjoy it as long as it seems right."</p> <p></p> <p>"Okay." I said, grinning. "I'm gonna take my top off for a while, but I don't want you to be jealous when I do it."</p> <p></p> <p>"Well, you're being awfully nice." she said, laughing like she did every morning.</p> <p></p> <p>"So am I." I responded, walking up to them. "You wanna go see a movie?" "Sure, we could catch a movie on Netflix for you." Mom said, holding my hand.</p> <p></p> <p>"I don't really know." I replied. "There's nothing out there but this place."</p> <p></p> <p>"Well, maybe I could catch a movie with you." Mom said. "Like that old old horror movie that always comes on."</p> <p></p> <p>"That could be fun." I replied, looking out the window briefly.</p> <p></p> <p>"No thanks." Mom said, walking towards the door. "You got it all wrong." She said as she opened the door. "We don't have a choice about this. This is what's going to happen. No 'no' or 'maybe' or any of that. You have to take that last shot and do it then do whatever you say to get what you want, whatever you say. Then do whatever it is you're going to do. Do it like I'm asking."</p> <p></p> <p>"Don't do that, mom, that's not fair! You're just gonna go with it, right?" I said. "Or do you just wanna go with it right now?"</p> <p></p> <p>"Well, you know what I mean!" she exclaimed. "That's my choice, but if you want to go with it, I can just choose to stay here with you."</p> <p></p> <p>"No! That wouldn't be fair." I said. "This is a nice, homely city with nice folks. I'm not like most in this country!"</p> <p></p> <p>"True, I thought you'd say that." she said. "I guess the best thing is here is good friends."</p> <p></p> <p>"You don't have to say that." I said. "We're done, you and me."</p> <p></p> <p>"Alright." she said, smiling. "Just make sure we're comfortable with this and we'll move in together on our own, or stay here until we decide we're ready to live here."</p> <p></p> <p>"So that's it then? That's the deal."</p> <p>"I think this is the one." she said, putting her foot on the bed. Then she climbed up on the bed next to me, resting her head on my shoulder. "You wanna do it?"</p> <p></p> <p>"Yeah." I said, putting one arm on top of her. Mom smiled. I turned my head towards hers and our lips met. Her lips tasted like honey as we kissed, the way I like. It was nice, and the kissing wasn't bad, but I could tell that it wasn't as good as in the last encounter. I didn't really make out with my mom. I felt like kissing her for the first time in my life. But it didn't stop the feelings at the same time, and I didn't really want it to stop. Maybe I did have a bad day earlier. Maybe I did a bad day, because I don't know really. But if I'd told you otherwise, would you have had your chance to do those things to me? I don't think I was ever that good, and what happened after that couldn't have made up for the things I said about myself, but now that we had the time, I'd get the answer to my question about sex again. Maybe I didn't feel bad about it, but the memory of what happened would have to make it easier forâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
