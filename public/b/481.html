I asked.</p> <p>"I didn't think it was a really good time to tell you," she said. "I wasn't looking forward to the possibility of you fucking up your marriage and me finding out. You know that's going to complicate things? Well, I hope you get over it by the time we finish dinner. I'm not looking forward to seeing your lovely body."</p> <p>"And if we end up fucking like rabbits?" I asked.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sorry. I guess we all know that. But I know it will always be a part of our marriage."</p> <p>"And it will always be this way?"</p> <p>"Absolutely."</p> <p>"Well, then why don't you go and have our way? You just say "hi" as we say "bye." I go upstairs and wait for you. You come into my bed a minute later. I go and get ready. I take my clothes off and put on my negligee. Then I go downstairs to get ready. When I come back to your bed we go out for a drink at a bar. We go back to my house.</p> <p>We're in your bedroom. I lay naked beside you on your bed. We kiss. While our tongues play against each other, we undress each other. Before you get the gown off me, you drop to your knees and begin to kiss mine. When we're both pretty naked you start a little on the left side of my body in your hot breath. When you get to my tits, you start to suck up my left one and bite my big pink nipple.</p> <p>"Oooh, baby. It feels so good sucking on my tits."</p> <p>You start to roll my nipple around in your mouth. You start to kiss down my belly. While it was pretty hot at the time I figured you couldn't possibly do it again, but you don't. I feel just a little jealous, maybe a little nervous. And then you start to kiss down my belly. When you reach my pussy, you kiss back up to my clit, starting at the top of my mound. You put your tongue in me, then up to the bottom of my slit. You lick my clit. When you do this, it feels like electricity shot through me from my clit to my pussy. Then you suck it into your mouth, pulling it with your teeth...</p> <p>I look down at you as your eyes devour my pussy. You're on all fours, head between my legs. You have your arms wrapped around my thighs. But you don't touch me with your tongue. Your tongue is still in me. I can feel your hot breath on my slit. It makes me feel like I can't breathe. My hips move up and down as I move my body back and forth in your mouth. It feels as if your tongue is licking my pussy. You hold my clit and suck on it. You suck on it a little hard. I can feel the electricity flowing through you. You start to flick it with your tongue. It sends me over.</p> <p>"Oh, God, that feels terrific," I say as I run my hands through your hair.</p> <p>Suddenly I can't take anymore, I wrap my arms tightly around your neck as my legs start to shake in my impending orgasm. When it hits me I feel like someone is sucking on my boobs. I'm trying to stifle it but you know how to pull me through. This is probably not the best way to end another session, but at least you seem to be on some sort of orgasmic cruise. If I were in bed, I was too. You can tell. You lift your head off me. That puts your arms around me completely under my legs and you get my legs over your shoulders so you can just hold me up against your mouth. You kiss down to my clit.</p> <p>"Baby, what do you want me to do? You can do what you want, but I think we'd better stop," you say.</p> <p>"You better do what you want," I say, " because I think it feels great."</p> <p>While you're doing that, I'm still trying to decide where we should go next. Your mouth at just the right temperature to give me another orgasm. I think maybe it's the alcohol it's getting.</p> <p>You let my legs down. You get up to your knees, reach over me and put your cock in my pussy. You begin to thrust in me. Up and down. I start to move my body as well, trying to make you harder. When you are almost at full penetration you lift up a little, then push me down again. Your pelvis is slamming into me. Every time I slide down on your cock I can feel it push against the walls.</p> <p>I could still feel the heat of the room as we kissed and you started toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
