I remember what this is?"</p> <p>"Not just about the money, but about all the men."</p> <p>"Good. We'll leave it that way."</p> <p>"We'll be out of here in less than five minutes. We need something to eat, a drink, and a smoke."</p> <p>"No, I didn't say that."</p> <p>"If we're going to do it in a hotel room with our friends, we need to do it in a house. Let's get something to eat and stay in here until we find out what we might get."</p> <p>I didn't want to leave, but I also didn't want to be in the middle of these problems. I nodded. I still felt guilty. We needed to be able to go through life without worrying about the people around us.</p> <p>We both ate quietly and drank more beer. In less then five minutes, we were ready to get back to what we needed to get out of this mess. The first thing was getting a change of clothes. It would take all of three minutes, so one was perfect. The second thing was putting on some underwear, too. I'd thought I'd never pull these two together, but they didn't go well together. I changed, then headed off again for the bedroom.</p> <p>Once I got dressed I checked my phone. It was six. I had seven left, with one left for the store. I walked over to my bag and got my new outfit. The top was the yellow thing with a cartoonish cover, which was just a touch, but was nice.</p> <p>I put on a light coat. I liked the yellow outfit. Then came a pair of green stockings. They didn't look too formal, either. I liked them because they went with the suit. I also had enough time to go to a nice restaurant so I could see what we did. I left a note for Mom. Her and Dad would be in town by the time I got there.</p> <p>I opened the door onto the street to see what my friends were going to eat. It looked nice from here on out. I had an appointment with a waiter for lunch.</p> <p>When I went back behind the curtain, I saw two nice looking men getting ready to go shopping. They looked like they hadn't much care to be there. I had the feeling they knew I was coming on to them, I figured it made me a little uneasy, but they weren't going to cause any problems.</p> <p>The waiter arrived and opened the curtains for us. Mom was leaning over a very attractive looking woman. They stood at least a foot apart. One of the other men came over to me. He placed my arm behind me, then took off my coat and handed me an envelope. "This is from the girl I spoke with. Are you alright?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm good. I'll leave it in your basket. Here in the bedroom." I opened the envelope, and sure enough, it was the receipt. "This is from your friend."</p> <p>I opened it carefully, and then went back to my bag and returned my coat to the changing booth. "What's this, man? This woman said something to me that caused a bit of an uproar in my church?"</p> <p>The waiter gave me his card and gave him the name of the restaurant. He gave my friends the receipt and then left us with my friends. Then I hurried over to the truck, opened the passenger door, and got in. The place still hadn't found any parking, but apparently my parents had been in touch with their carpenter before getting out of town. I was glad to have them in town with me, too.</p> <p>I turned to the left, to start our drive back to wherever I was going. This was going to be a long day. Not counting one more question. We would never forget this.</p> <p>The driver's side door opened and my boyfriend got in, and I went and got into the driver's side. We were headed down the road in about five minutes. I turned on the lights and started the truck. He started back toward the center of town. "I haven't done that in awhile. You drive slowly." He reached over and gave me a light kiss on the lips. "Remember to drive slow. You'll find it easier."</p> <p>"I do, and I do. I'm here." I turned the truck around and drove again.</p> <p>"Let's go get something to eat, just follow me."</p> <p>He got out and was waiting for me. Our dinner was pretty good, I had had enough. It was then that I started to get uncomfortable. I didn't want to think about what I might say. No, I didn't want to think about what I mightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
