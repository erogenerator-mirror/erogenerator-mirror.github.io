I think it's time you show me a new hobby. You see, honey, your new hobby is to make love to people, and I really like having that kind of power."</p> <p>Sylvia moved to put her husband's hand on her breast, but he got away. "You promised me something you promised me on Friday. You said that you wanted to make love to me."</p> <p>Her husband's face contorted, as he said, "I...I can't take it. It's too, too late. I'm too horny." He went for the zipper on her dress, and pulled it down. She took off her wedding band and dropped it on her lap. He unzipped his jeans as he said, "Come here with me."</p> <p>He guided her onto her knees with the zipper still down. First, he kissed her belly button, a light kiss, a light kiss, as she looked him over. His eyes, like a hawk, looked down at her as she leaned forward and started rubbing his cock through his briefs. She pulled out his tool and started it. She had never experienced anything so large, and hard, in her life, and he was so damn big, that by the way, it looked like he was twice the size of her forearm.</p> <p>As her lips wrapped around the head of his cock, Sylvia said, "I like feeling you get that hard, like that, with just the right amount of sucking. And feeling you go deep down that throat, because in your head, you're so big...."</p> <p>She took his tool farther down her throat, and pulled it out again, stroking the base with her hands, as she moaned softly. He could see some drops of pre-cum drip onto her tongue. Her hand started working the base as he put his hands on the back of her head and started fucking her mouth. A groan escaped his lips as he started moving her head back and forth on his cock. Her body began to tremble as he got closer and closer into her throat. He grabbed her head with both hands and told her to open up.</p> <p>"I'm so close, my love," he whispered.</p> <p>With a slight moan escaping her lips, she went back to sucking his member, the full length.</p> <p>"Yes, suck me, sweetheart....gently....yesssssss...."</p> <p>Sylvia continued to work his dick with her hot mouth and all it had to do was breathe.</p> <p>Then, his words were cut off as he started shooting his load in her mouth.</p> <p>"Yes, swallow that hot, sticky stuff...."</p> <p>"I am so proud of you!"</p> <p>He held her head as he started to pull her back up and out of his lap, a little on his cum, but much more in her mouth.</p> <p>Sylvia got up as he was pulling out his dick. She leaned to him and kissed him, and held him as he started to put his clothes on.</p> <p>But soon, his hands were all over her, groping her breasts and rubbing her stomach. After several tries, he got his hands into her panties and found her pussy. He slipped two fingers into it and rubbed her clit while still pumping his fingers in and out of her pussy. It felt so good.</p> <p>"Ohhh....yesssss....just like that...."</p> <p>Sylvia continued to squeeze him, then got up and put her dress on. It fit and looked good on her. A little sweat glistened on her brow, making his dick glisten. She picked up her husband's hand, took it into her mouth, tasting his cum, and smiling for him. He kissed her back, their lips tight. For a few seconds, she didn't say a word, and then said, "Honey, can you do me a favor? I've been trying to get the best part of the job all week to be with you. I'm sorry, I won't ruin your weekend."</p> <p>He took her in his arms and started kissing her again, letting his hands explore her body. She had no idea where this was going, but her body was betraying her. She knew that soon, he was going to be inside her. She started rubbing her face against his face, and started thinking of the time his wife had told her, "There's no love for love."</p> <p>Then she started to think about how she was going to come home on her hands and knees begging her husband for sex, knowing he was watching every move his wife made, knowing he was going to get a blow job, knowing he had his dick in her, and then knowing that he would end up being there, that his dick was in her pussy on that couchâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
