He slid his fingers just under my panties on the outside and slowly, sensually slid them up one thigh where he found his way inside my panties. I could feel myself getting wet, but he kept doing it for so long that I was afraid I'm going to come before he did. He did not give me a chance to get him off, but kissed my neck right where the hairline begins. He did this for several minutes and when I was starting to relax enough to breath he moved a hand higher up my leg and slipped that hand under the elastic of my panties. As he felt the wetness of my pussy in his hand, he put a finger in my pussy and just kept going, his fingers feeling my whole body. I felt myself start to come... and that sent a wave through my body that made me moan out loud... but he did not finish what he had started, and when I let out one of the loudest noises I've ever made, I started to squirt and the hot liquid flew all over his hand and it landed a good distance from my face all the way up to my breasts.</p> <p>I was so embarrassed that a man could do this to me in public, but there I was, still soaking wet, and my pussy contracting, contracting all over his hand... my legs shaking and trembling with excitement and aching sexual arousal, and he started to kiss it all off. He lifted my panties to one side and put his face right in-between my legs to kiss me where the source of it had been.</p> <p>My whole body shook with excitement and desire. I had never been kissed that way before with a man... never... his tongue felt so good in me, it caused waves of excitement to spread throughout my body. I knew I was going to come again... so close... so soon... but he didn't stop. He took his tongue out of my mouth... and I could feel it again, just a little more of my own juices still to slide out of me. I was about to ask him to stop... and maybe let me come again. But I could feel a wetness growing in my pussy that was going to take me over the edge. I felt the intensity of it and the sensation. I was trying to hold myself back for it... but his fingers were doing it... pressing against my g-spot again and again... I exploded again... with a loud cry that I could barely even hear, and my orgasm sent it through me so intensely that I lost my ability to breath for a while. I felt myself coming down from the high of it. And when I was done coming down, I tried to get my breath back as a smile crossed my lips. The guy at the front of the table whispered to me, and when I opened my eyes that it was still dark in the room, I realized that it must have been almost ten minutes now, and I just smiled.</p> <p>"I'd say there are ten people sitting right in front of me, now," the guy said, and I looked up and saw that our man was still watching intently. I looked around the restaurant, but there wasn't many people there, I guess we had been there a while. I looked to the man to say something, and the owner smiled at me, and looked back and grinned a crooked smile.</p> <p>"That was the most fun I've ever seen," he said, and I just smiled and shook my head.</p> <p>"That's a whole other story... and I have no idea where it got..." I said as I looked him in the eyes and he looked down into his lap.</p> <p>"Well, I sure hope your friend has someone who could be that adventurous..." he said. And he just kept looking at me - I could imagine how he thought it would be.</p> <p>He reached across the table to rub my thigh. I could tell it's not going to be long now... "Oh, and I don't want to make you feel guilty about anything you have just done..." and I was about to say something about that before he pushed it all out of his mind. I looked down to him and saw that his cock was tenting his pants. I wanted to tell him that I really liked him and liked the way he put me at ease, but I didn't and was afraid that I wouldn't be able to say I did.</p> <p>"It's not right... not with someone who's been with you before," his hand landed on the outside of my left thigh and he looked down into my eyes. "I am your friend, so I will share... But don't be embarrassed if we can't... I'd love to see your body again..." His voice turned serious again. "I just thought you would like to see it as much as I do", hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
