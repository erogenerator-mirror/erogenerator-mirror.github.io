It was then that I realised that I was breathing very heavily. I looked around the room quickly. The room was completely dark.</p> <p>'What's this?' a voice said from behind me.</p> <p>'What's happening?!' I cried out at the top of me lungs.</p> <p>'Get over here bitch.' he said in a menacing tone.</p> <p>I was shaking violently. I struggled against him, desperately seeking to escape him, but I only succeeded in wriggling against his grip. I was suddenly aware of a hand touching my shoulder. It was my old boyfriend, Chris.</p> <p>'Get over here bitch, come over here.' he said harshly, pulling me off of Toni and onto my feet.</p> <p>'I got to tell you something.' I said.</p> <p>'What is it bitch?' Chris said firmly. He stepped forward to my left, his hands moving quickly over my body, feeling me up. 'You were fucking a young guy, weren't you? You were the one taking a dump on me. Don't you think that you've done everything I had asked you?'</p> <p>'I think so', I thought. 'No, I don't think so.' I felt a hand on each of my breasts, and he tugged downwards on the tie that held my top together.</p> <p>'Well, the truth is I just got out of bed late that day, and this young guy was there. I thought I was doing too good of a job. He didn't need any help.' a voice said. It wasn't my old boyfriend. Instead it was just a young guy, he must have been about twenty years older than I was.</p> <p>My heart began to pound in my chest. I could not breathe, with just a tiny bit. 'What's wrong with your old boyfriend?' I wondered.</p> <p>'Don't you know something?' he replied in a low, but menacing voice.</p> <p>'I just told you not to tell' I said in a half panic.</p> <p>Chris reached down and squeezed my breasts harder and pinched my nipples, twisting and pulling them. 'No, we can't do anything right now. You don't have to do this. We can wait as long as you want.' he said in an unprofessional tone. It all added up, and it was hard for me to let him go now as I was sure that I would be arrested. Even though it was all very hard.</p> <p>'Please Chris, don't do this' I tried to cry.</p> <p>Chris stepped forward. 'Honey, please don't do this to me. I don't have to do this, it's just too weird. You don't want anything done with me. It doesn't mean anything.' he said as he pushed my shoulders back until I was leaning on my tip-toes. 'It just means that you should go. Go fuck yourself now, you idiot.' he said.</p> <p>'But I have to fuck him....' I stammered.</p> <p>'You know you can't. The man of my life is all in your fantasy.' Chris said, walking over to stand in front of me with his hand on my shoulder. 'He needs my permission. Now get over here. If you don't put up a brave face and stop this madness, there will be hell to pay!' he said. Then he held his hand out for mine, squeezing my arm tightly which felt as if it was on fire. 'We must do this this way now. Not now or later.' he said in a cold voice.</p> <p>I could not move. The old boyfriend was so intimidating. He reached out to me, grabbed my arms roughly and pulled them up behind my back until my arms were around my body. He then stood me up onto my feet, and pulled me against him roughly till my breasts were pressed into his stomach, my body tingling with a mix of excitement and trepidation.</p> <p>'Are you sure you don't want me to let you go? That wouldn't be right. You can't let me do this, it's my business.' Toni yelled at me as Chris pulled me towards him.</p> <p>The room was lit up by candles. They had all been flicked away or replaced with soft light-bulbes. Chris, now holding me by both sides, turned me around. With his free hand he pushed my back until it nearly touched the bed and then bent me over at the waist till my stomach was pressing against the edge. I knew then that he was going to fuck me, and probably do it fast, which was what I needed. I wanted him, needed him in me. Chris looked down at me with a menacing and lustful look inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
