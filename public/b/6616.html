Most were women of various age, with a few a few a few who seemed to work out or work out.</p> <p>He motioned to the guy who was sitting next to him. He introduced himself as David, as you would expect and he was looking at this pretty dark-haired young lady a bit more closely. She seemed to smile at him as she extended her hand to him. He stood up and looked her up and down.</p> <p>She seemed very attractive, but she had a small nose on her. She was short and only about 5'6" if she had it pulled way below her chin, and she had auburn hair that fell across her chest with a few strands hanging down into her cleavage. She sat down at the same end of the couch as you would expect the couch to be and was dressed in a skirt that came down to mid thigh. She made herself comfortable, took a sip of wine and then started, "I'm sorry that your coffee has a tendency to be too much for me, but do you think you could please pass the little girl over to me?"</p> <p>David looked her up and down again and said, "That is very kind of you, mom" and raised his glass as an afterthought.</p> <p>"I'm very interested" she said and leaned over and kissed him on the cheek and said, "and very interested to see if we could make it a big day for ya?"</p> <p>David nodded and smiled to himself at her flirtatiousness and as we continued to socialize, he asked the other woman on the couch if she had a special drink he could use, but she only nodded.</p> <p>David said, "If both of us are going to have a 'flavor' for you, would you like something stronger or something stronger to drink?"</p> <p>"A lot stronger" was her reply, and she stood up and said, "Let me have that glass."</p> <p>"Coming up, how about some coffee and some beer."</p> <p>"OK...what? Oh yeah, I'll get us a beer right away" she joked, and then proceeded to serve herself our drinks.</p> <p>While we were sipping our drinks, I noticed that everyone seemed to be looking at him and wondered what was going on. I figured it was as innocent as watching an old movie. I quickly downed the second cup of beer in the bar and noticed David glance at me as well.</p> <p>"Well, you and your mom seem like a nice couple" he said.</p> <p>"Oh, she is her mom" I replied "and mine is my stepmom"</p> <p>"Sounds nice" David responded, and as he did, he added, "She is going to make you her partner for life."</p> <p>"Don't remind me" I said. He went into his living room for a minute and then walked back with a beer in his hand and asked, "Do you mind sharing?"</p> <p>At that point, I didn't care if he was a little drunk, but I said, "I don't think it is appropriate for you to be drinking alcohol at all. I was just hoping you needed that."</p> <p>"I appreciate it, hon. This conversation is a little too intimate for that today. Just tell me to mind my manners, OK?"</p> <p>He looked at me with a smile and said, "No, mom, that you can share, I'm sure that our conversation can have other things on its mind."</p> <p>He went back into the living room and closed and locked the door, I figured that meant that he might have been looking at me differently and I could see that he was getting uncomfortable.</p> <p>He pulled out his chair and sat down next to me. He looked us both over and then said, "Well, here we are, with no more questions, I'll admit I still have a hard time believing that I might be interested in you. It's just that I think I might have a better chance than your wife with a better chance at a lot of guys then with any of your exes."</p> <p>I blushed and said, "Well, I guess that makes me your ex, what do you mean? But...I don't...feel guilty or anything like that. In fact, I kind of feel really good about seeing you and your mom as lovers. That's what makes me think you're OK with all this, I don't do that to anyone just for the sex. But since you're having a hard time with it, I hope your mom and mine aren't too tight in bed. "</p> <p>He reached out and took my hand and placed it on his thigh. He said, "I'm not going to get close to the subject that's on your mind, butâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
