When he pulled back the covers, she turned her back to him then, exposing the back of her neck, and he began to caress the muscles in the valley between. "Take your clothes off," he said.</p> <p>It took her only a few seconds to realize what he wanted. He had taken the phone from her hands and had been taking pictures of everything. "You can have the phone if you want. If you want it I'll be there for you anytime you want and I get pictures I will take to you."</p> <p>"You're kidding." She stared at him. She was not stupid. He looked her over, looking for the bruises on her wrists. He could see how pale she was, and she looked so soft and pretty. "We can't do this," she said. "We can't do this here."</p> <p>"I know," he smiled and kissed her neck. "Trust me." She knew he understood her. "Are you sure you want a repeat?"</p> <p>This was new to her. All she needed to do was think. "Let's go," she said.</p> <p>His hand went from her neck to the small of her back. When it reached her skirt, she raised her hips. Her hand stopped him. "No, not yet."</p> <p>His hand went back up to her belly, then reached into the top of her panties. He looked in her eyes, his breath coming back down his throat. Her stomach tensed again, and then she lifted her hips again and the panties slid off. Her hand dropped to his as they made love.</p> <p>"You can touch me," she said.</p> <p>His fingers found her sex, and slid it open. She leaned back against him and he kissed her, her fingers tangled in his hair, her hips beginning to move again. She kissed him back, hard. His fingers found her clit and began to stroke against it. The feeling made her shake, and she moved her hips harder. He was kissing the side of her face and neck so fast, her cheeks felt flushed. She let her hand drop back to herself, holding it there.</p> <p>"Your turn," she thought. "</p> <p>He kissed up along both sides of her nose, before sliding around to her lips again and kissing the side of her jaw. He kissed both her breasts, working his way down to the tip in between her breasts. She felt the blood rushing to her hips and it sent an electric tingle up her abdomen, as did the pulsating feeling down to her sex. God, she wanted this man to touch her, to kiss her, to be with her. She wanted to feel his breath on her. She wanted his tongue inside her. She wanted his hands to feel her everywhere. She wanted his lips to kiss her again and again as he took what he wanted from her body.</p> <p>And he did, moving from her neck along the way down to her stomach. His hands continued their journey south until their hands met between her legs. At this point he slipped his fingers inside, one slipping into her opening, making them wet. "I've wanted this for so long," he said. "I want to take things slow." She had no complaints. She was not lying about that either.</p> <p>Her hips were moving to meet his fingers even as the pressure between her legs built. "Do it. Fuck me."</p> <p>He began to kiss the inside of her knee, moving up to the soft curve of her leg. She felt his lips kiss the inside of her ankle. She closed her eyes against his. He kissed the soft skin between her calf and knee. His hands had left her legs while he moved up her body, sliding the fabric down her smooth skin. She lifted her hips to assist him, and suddenly she felt him slide between them. His erection, hard and hot, throbbed between her legs. She felt her heat grow. The contact, the pressure, his lips on her skin. It made her want him, wanting him in her body and in her heart. It made her head swim. It made her want to kiss him. She wanted him to suck on her breasts, to kiss her nipples and to do whatever it took to give herself what she had wanted the most in life.</p> <p>Slowly his hardness moved down to meet her sex. For a moment he stopped. She opened her eyes just a little bit. She felt him move back, then slide back up, then his hand came at last close. Fingers caressed her outer lips. One moved between them and began to push against her. This time the feeling was different. It was a caress, a stroking of skin.
