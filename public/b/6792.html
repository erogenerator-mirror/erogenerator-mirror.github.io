"Yes, yes!"</p> <p>"You're wonderful!" he sighed to her as he kissed her passionately on her mouth.</p> <p>His hands began to roam freely over her body. She was so beautiful and he wanted to take her. He lifted her on to the bed and pulled on her clothes first.</p> <p>"I want you," he breathed to her.</p> <p>She took his face and pressed it to hers as their lips met. She kissed his strong lips. She wrapped her legs around his waist. He picked her up and set her on the bed in front of him.</p> <p>"I want you," she said.

A moment later, he saw her cum through the light of the room. Her pussy clamped down on his cock and he felt her body tense. Her body was so tight and so sensitive. It excited him and when she stopped, his shaft began to spasm and send ropes of cum shooting inside of her. Their moans were loud in the room.</p> <p>She fell back, panting. After a while they caught their breath.</p> <p>"I think it was worth the wait we've got." He paused to stare at her.</p> <p>"Thank you," she said.
