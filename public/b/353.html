I did not plan on it, Miss Dworkin," I said shyly.</p> <p>"Oh, right," she answered. "When you come to New York I thought that would be my ticket, just as long as I have this opportunity, and I am glad to do it for you."</p> <p>Her voice was calm as she spoke, as she leaned in for a long kiss, which neither of us seemed willing to part. But when the kiss broke, I could not say no, nor protest. Her kisses were so soft, like no man I had ever had, just the kind who would be so gentle with a girl, and she had done them again and again; it was so unlike the little things with the guy who was the best. "Thank you, Lass, very much. And I could have waited all day, I didn't want you to think... of something that could cause you and me to break up. We'll talk about it as much as you like, and, I have to say, we should talk again soon. Or when you are on your way back."</p> <p>"Thank you," I whispered shyly. "I just wanted to feel what it is like to be a girl again. I didn't expect... well, it's not like I was going to get it tonight... but thank you for opening your mind to me, thank you for what you have done for me... and it seems right to talk now."</p> <p>We exchanged a look full of relief. It was an open and honest gesture from the girl I could not have expected a relationship with, but it seemed to cheer me up somewhat. I thought of going to class; it was all I needed to pull off my new life as a woman, even just thinking about the idea of sex again. It was a start!</p> <p>Lass wasn't too happy with it, and I know it must have come across her as a bit too abrupt, but... I didn't see how she would know this was something she really wanted from me, or that I should want it. But she said we could talk tomorrow at class, after she had an appointment with 'the girl' at the gym that she had thought she could not tell me about.</p> <p>"I'm sorry about before, Miss Dworkin. It didn't seem that you understood."</p> <p>She kissed me gently on the lips, this time with more confidence, and with more desire than she had previously displayed. "That's alright... I understand. Now," she said firmly, "I want to really talk to you and get to know you better and we can decide what to do next." She smiled so sweetly, so tenderly, that I thought our smiles must have shown my own sincerity; and that made me feel the same, too.</p> <p>As the words passed my lips, I thought: 'This is going to be so strange!!' I couldn't ask for a better girl that way; but she was right, and I knew it would just be like going to school every morning. But, it did occur to me that she might want to kiss me, and that would surely be an opportunity... and right then I was in the mood for a good, long, hard and fast, fucking for sure!!</p> <p>We kissed again, and then she said goodbye, and turned to go. My heart was racing. I could not wait to think about what we had done.</p> <p>Chapter 4 -- The Plan - Lass</p> <p>Lass was in class Monday. She was doing well, as she had said. I felt that perhaps this was the first time we had ever had this conversation with another woman: and it really hadn't had much if any thought of changing anything. She had said that she liked 'intercourse' and it had worked out great for us.</p> <p>I was thinking about what I was going to say to her on Monday. I decided to let my heart do the talking, and I wanted her to think that she had the power over me for ever, and that we had found the 'right' place - which meant that we would always be together, no matter what. I knew what she felt, what she thought, and I knew in my heart that I had her totally. So... I took a deep breath, and said: "Lass, are you sure about what you want?"</p> <p>"I have to answer the question, Miss Dworkin." She leaned into me very close, and kissed me again. I don't know why I ever let anything come before; I guess it always seemed like a good idea to be in the moment. She smiled at me, and said: "Are you sure about this?"</p> <p>"Yes... and I meant what I said about not wanting to hurt you... which is why I will let a good thing happen hereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
