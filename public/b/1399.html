Don't stop right there. I'm going to cum very soon.' And I did. I was feeling very light headed and horny. And she didn't pull it away. She was giving my cock head a final squeeze. And then she looked up and smiled.</p> <p>'Thank you my love for doing what you're about to. So this is the last chance we have of having sex, right?'</p> <p>'Hmmm!'</p> <p>'You don't need to call me love.' And once more she put her thumb up in the air and gave my cock a few more jerks while staring me in the mirror.</p> <p>'Now, if you'll excuse us, we have to get ready.' And as she said that I felt her hand slide over my cock and feel it swell up. She turned and gave the head of my cock a couple of slow, firm strokes.</p> <p>'Oh my God, that feels good.'</p> <p>'Yes it does, feels very good. And you'll like what comes next.' And this time I felt her hand on my cock again. She started to rub up and down my shaft while she whispered in my ear.</p> <p>'Are you alright? You look a bit flushed.'</p> <p>'Yes, I'm fine. Sorry.'</p> <p>'Don't worry. I want to help you feel this right.'</p> <p>She took my hand and placed it next to a chair I was standing in as she started to work on my cock with her hand. In no time she had me going to the point where I was close and ready to come. And then. She pushed her thumb back down on the head of my cock, held it hard, and said,</p> <p>'I want you to cum on me. Just with your hand on my body.'</p> <p>I nodded and watched as my cock disappeared between her breasts. And then she leaned forward to look in the mirror. Her eyes went straight for the camera and she took a few more photos. She got up and went over to a dresser, took out a couple of pill bottles and put them on the top of her dresser. Then, with her back to me she reached over and opened the lid to the dresser. I watched as she pulled her panties from beneath her dress and put them on. The front of her body was still completely visible to the camera. Then, with a big smile on her face, she sat back down on her knees and removed her shoes and undies.</p> <p>'So, am I going to see you again in person?' And she started to play with my cock. 'We're going to have to do something. You're my fantasy. And I like that.' And then back to what I was watching.</p> <p>She grabbed my hand and put it on her breast. 'You're not done yet?'</p> <p>'Mmm...' And she started to rub my cock up and down her breast.</p> <p>'I want you so badly. Take what you want. What you want. And it's OK, I know it's not going to be just sex, but I want you to enjoy yourself.'</p> <p>And I leaned forward and ran my tongue over her nipple. And once again, she took my hand and placed it on her bare thigh. And then started to run it slowly up the inside of her leg until she stopped and took my hand in hers again. I placed it just inside her pussy lips and felt them open to me.</p> <p>'What happens now, depends on how you want to finish.'</p> <p>'Oh, I don't want to finish yet.' And with a quick jerk up from her breast, I felt my hard cock slide into her pussy. She moaned and put her arms around my neck. And with a great look in the mirror, she said,</p> <p>'Oh my God. What do we have here?' And she started to pull herself up and down my cock just making me go. Her body was just as sexy as she said it was and she gave me a sexy look as she made me go.</p> <p>And then she stood up. And then she put her arms around my neck and gave me a long deep kiss. And again, I felt my cock disappear into her. And while we kissed, I could feel my cock disappearing into and pulling out of her pussy with every stroke.</p> <p>After a while she pulled me to her and then she stood back up. And then she turned her back to me and slowly bent over till her hips were just beside my feet. She stepped up to stand next to me. Her hands reached around her body and reached under her nightgown just past her breasts. And then to the side. My hands cupped her ass just below her tits. I could feel my cock pressing against her while both of us still were standing facing the mirror.</p> <p>'Wow. You're really into this. But I wantâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
