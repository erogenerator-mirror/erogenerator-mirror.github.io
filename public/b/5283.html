I got a sinking suspicion because I had been with other girls also.</p> <p>"What about Jim?" she asked. "He is not like you, is he?"</p> <p>"No," I said with my heart breaking, "but I won't forget this." She was looking at each of us, as if to ask, "Are you willing to be ours?"</p> <p>"Yes," both of us said, and then I realized, she's not going to be my real husband. She's going to be just a toy to play with. A toy for my pleasure, that's all there is to it.</p> <p>"Then take off your clothes," she said. "I have to go make love to a guy," she told the two of us. With a little whimper, I removed my clothes and stepped into the shower. She entered behind me and hugged me.</p> <p>"You are going to love the surprise I have planned!" she yelled as she picked up a towel and wrapped it around me and then sat on the bed. She kissed me on the cheek and then asked, "Are you all right?"</p> <p>"Yes," I said again. "I think I will still be dreaming when I wake up."</p> <p>"You can forget me, if you want," she said and took my hand and led me to the foot of her bed. She sat on her side and looked me in the eye. "I want you to know that you are mine," she told me, "and that I like to be your toy. I will always be here for you."</p> <p>"I don't want to leave you," I answered, "but what will it be like to be a toy, to be the one you belong to?"</p> <p>"I don't know," she told me.</p> <p>"You will," I said with as much conviction as I could muster, "I promise." She leaned over me and kissed me on the mouth. She was not the seductress that I once knew, but she was now a woman again. Before I could think about it, she kissed and sucked my lower lip and worked her way down my other lip, until they were both fully exposed. Then, she kissed my upper lip and started kissing and licking them, until she came across the hood of my clit.</p> <p>"If you want, we can switch from kissing to licking." She asked. I smiled as she did, realizing that I had made a mistake. As I realized the truth, I smiled, and put my legs up, spreading myself so she would have easier access. My hand went to my nipples and began to tweak them, while she continued down my body until she got to my clits and stuck her two fingers into my pussy.</p> <p>Without touching her, she moved over, and sat beside me. She got down and began to lick her own pussy and clit while my hands reached up to play with her pussy. She moved her fingers up and down and rubbed my clit with her fingers as she lapped up my juice. I felt myself getting closer to cumming, so I pushed down on her head and said, "Fuck me, please, make me cum." Her eyes opened and saw me, and then she dove on myself and brought me off.</p> <p>"What the fuck was that all about?" she asked, "you want me to eat off another girl's pussy, but I am not your slut?"</p> <p>"No," I said. "I don't care. You have to finish me off, I have no idea how but I am going to cum." She looked at me for a moment, just for a moment. "And this," she said, "is for you."</p> <p>"What about Jim," I answered.</p> <p>"He will know if you are in him," she said.</p> <p>"Well, he already knows," I said.</p> <p>"Good," she said. "You both will have different things to do, because I won't share him with anyone. And Jim can't really know what I like. It will have to be your decision. Is that fair?" She asked.</p> <p>"I don't see how fair," I said.</p> <p>"You heard me, fuck me," was her answer.</p> <p>She got on the bed and said, "Get on your back."</p> <p>I got on the bed and did as I was told and was amazed at what I had done. The second thing I thought of was the taste. My first thought was that it had never tasted so good, but the second thought was that there wasn't any room for one so I dove into her pussy. A moment later, I had my first taste of pussy. I sucked her pussy lips, and then ran my tongue over her clit and then into her pee holeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
