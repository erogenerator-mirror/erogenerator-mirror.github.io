I'm here so much I can never look at you again," he told her, kissing her on the cheek and giving her a playful wink. He stepped out of the room, not bothering to get dressed, and went out on to the couch before he came back and sat next to the naked girl. "Ready for some food?" he asked her, smiling happily.</p> <p>"I am famished," she said, looking at the food on the plate as she ate.</p> <p>***</p> <p>"Are you still in the mood?" Danni asked as she opened the door a crack and looked outside.</p> <p>"Uh... Yeah... yeah, it is pretty... it is going to be a little too cool in here... I guess."</p> <p>"Oh, that's fine," Danni said as she walked outside with her bag. She opened up the back door, turned to face the patio, then started to open the door once for herself. Just inside the door, she heard a light humming coming from the deck. Walking a little further, Danni peeked around the door and saw the little island with a small waterfall in front of it.</p> <p>"It's beautiful!" she said, suddenly pulling her bag out from inside it and looking at it. She had been so close to the house in the sun, she couldn't resist stepping into there when she heard the sounds of another humming.</p> <p>"Oh! I could stare in there forever! The water is fantastic!" she said, feeling the sun slowly sinking lower and further, making her skin feel warm all over. Slowly, as if in slow motion, she began walking around the edge of the deck on one of the small wooden benches beside the waterfall.</p> <p>"Oh, look, it's so nice here! I'm glad that I haven't left the house yet, my friends are dying to see where I've been! We can talk or hang out here while we wait!"</p> <p>She laughed softly and pulled up a chair next to the edge of the table, where the waterfall was pouring down into it. She sat down next to her friend on the bench and placed a hand on her cheek, caressing it as they watched the water lapping by on a small beach.</p> <p>"I hope you have a bathing suit here tonight, I need to see you in one," she said with a wink, knowing there was nothing there that she wouldn't wear.</p> <p>"Oh, there is," Danni said smiling at her friend. She was already looking down the trail at it and had made a point to take off the top of her dress where it would be more likely that she would be nude.</p> <p>"But that's not all of it is it?"</p> <p>Danni looked across the water at her friend and saw that her skin had been covered in goosebumps on her chest and, although it showed signs of being a little chilly in the morning, it looked to be in just the right places.</p> <p>"Yeah, no, not that... not at all," she smiled and took her hand, placing it over the girl's cheek.</p> <p>"Danni... I wanted to tell you something though... I hope you aren't uncomfortable with it," she said with a smile as she put her small palm over the girl's cheek, giving it a gentle push.</p> <p>"I'm just not sure if I should be asking you that, Danni. It's going to be a bit hard to take, you know. But I hope that I'm doing the right thing, I just need some space."</p> <p>"I was wondering if you would mind coming with me tonight... would you?"</p> <p>Danni smiled as she stood up, pulling her bag along a few moments. "Well... maybe tomorrow?" she said as she grabbed her bag from the bench and headed out into the garden to put the rest of her clothes she had just put away away and her clothes into her backpack, her new bag from Victoria's Secret in the back.</p> <p>"Well... sure. It was nice seeing you again," she said when Danni saw her smiling.</p> <p>"It was nice seeing you... I think it's about time for you to return it to me," Danni said, reaching out to touch her friend's other hand. She wasn't sure whether the feel she had received through her finger tips just made her feel more excited, or whether it had been an involuntary reaction to Danni's touching her, but either way, it still felt good and it wasn't too long after they had started touching each other's hands, it was just that it didn't seem right.</p> <p>She smiled and gently pulled her friend's face closer to hers and kissed her, softly at first, then harder as their breathing became heavy and their hands were becoming sweaty. Their tongues started to slip into each other's mouth as they continued exploring each other's bodiesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
