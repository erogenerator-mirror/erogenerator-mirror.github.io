"Oh god, you feel so wonderful...so good...suck my cock..." I was so caught up in the moment that I didn't notice the other end of the strap-on that I had been sucking in, as I sucked it.</p> <p>"Do you like me on the other side of the strap-on," she asked.</p> <p>I almost said yes, but stopped myself. I wanted to suck it so much that I was on the verge of begging her to let me. I wanted her to take me, force me to my knees, and have her take me. I did want the strap-on, and I wanted her to have me. For that is the whole of my identity. I had no control over when to choose to have sex, or when to be a cock to be used for what was and was not about. Only when it was about to be, was it not my choice?</p> <p>"That cock is magnificent, you know that?" I heard from the other bed, and I heard her say. "But now I think my husband's are the one here. I want that cock inside me now!"</p> <p>It would be another moment of awkwardness, and then I would have to say the word and her husband would know, although, to be perfectly clear, he didn't know. "I was thinking this afternoon, that it would be you fucking my wife. And I wanted you to make me do it, to see what I was allowing myself, while I am being fucked."</p> <p>"I just want to watch you in the morning," her husband said from the other bed.</p> <p>"Don't you agree, honey?" her other husband said.</p> <p>"Yes....yes!" Her husband said as his wife walked around the bed to the other side. "You have no fucking way of winning this, honey?"</p> <p>"I would not have it any other way....to be able to fuck you...." Her husband said to her, but he stopped himself mid moan.</p> <p>And now the cock that I had so desperately wanted in her pussy was fucking up into her, my wife was fucking my best friend, in our hotel room. And she was encouraging me.</p> <p>"That feels so good, honey. You can fuck me...just watch!" She said, and she pushed her ass in further and I could see she used her thighs to wrap her fingers around his hips. She held him in, and he lifted his hips for just long enough to push his dick all the way to the back of my throat.</p> <p>"Oh, baby...that feels so good..." He said. "So fucking good..."</p> <p>I did my best to make noises, but it was not easy to move as my dick was fully erect through the strap-on cock. A strange feeling came over me and I was trying to hold out because it was such an important moment.</p> <p>"That's it, fuck me, please fuck me!" My wife said. "Don't be a wimp....make me cum...."</p> <p>She kept talking for a minute, but, I can only speculate, it was as if she was saying, you really don't fuck your best friend as you do that. Because the cock in my mouth felt good, and I could sense it was getting bigger.</p> <p>My wife had her fingers up inside and was grinding the fake cock as she felt my mouth on it. My eyes were closed, pretending to be asleep, and she looked over and watched how I was sucking on it.</p> <p>"That feels good, honey. I can feel you sucking on it, but you like what I'm doing, hon?"</p> <p>"Yes...yes, honey....suck it..." I moaned.</p> <p>She was still grinding his hips, making sounds in her throat.</p> <p>"Yes, dear, suck on it...suck on it!"</p> <p>I could sense the first explosion coming, and I felt it rise from deep within and then explode inside of me. And, for a moment, I didn't think I wanted it.</p> <p>"Oh yes, baby girl...." Her husband sighed, as she moaned out, and the cock in his mouth began to spurt, and shoot its load deep down my throat.</p> <p>The cock in my mouth felt warm, heavy, and it kept on coming and coming and coming.</p> <p>Finally it stopped, the cock stopped spitting it's load, and it left my lips and I pulled off. She kissed me deeply, her tongue dancing inside my mouth.</p> <p>"Oh, sweetheart," she said, running her hands down my body and playing with my nipples, and my dick came to attention, and she kissed me again and ran her fingers through my hair.</p> <p>The other bed began to move, and I heard her husband sayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
