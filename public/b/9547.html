I haven't... ever... felt this good. It just feels so good. Thank you so much."</p> <p>She slowly pulled her finger out of my butt then slowly back down my leg, caressing the inner part of my thigh the whole time.</p> <p>"Is that feeling too good for you?" she asked smiling sweetly.</p> <p>"Yeeeess... it feels... really good."</p> <p>She moved up beside me, and gently guided my right leg as she slid her hand up my leg to my pussy, lightly teasing my very aroused clit. I immediately felt a rush of electricity run through my body, and the first thing my brain registered was that in just a short while, my orgasm would be imminent.</p> <p>She slowly continued with her hand, slipping off the bed, and walked toward the bathroom, turning on the shower as soon as she exited. She was so beautiful, beautiful, sweet, tender woman. I couldn't help but be drawn to her every emotion. I was in awe that she could just stand in the shower and give herself away to another human being.</p> <p>I slowly pulled her back on to the bed, kissing her deeply, sucking her tongue into my mouth briefly, then sliding her wet body back towards the pillows, and spooning her. I felt her wrap her leg around me.</p> <p>We fell asleep that way with me laying on my side and her on top of me. Her lips pressed softly against my neck, breathing heavily in my ears. I just stayed perfectly still, just enjoying the feeling of her mouth on my body.</p> <p>I was already getting close to an orgasm when we awoke, and I stopped her from removing her mouth from mine as she started sucking on one of my nipples.</p> <p>She continued this while she kept her hand on my clit, and then with one finger I came in her mouth and watched her swallow for a few seconds.</p> <p>"So wonderful," I said finally.</p> <p>"Mmmhmm."</p> <p>"This is... so wonderful," I added.</p> <p>She got out of bed and went to the bathroom, returning with a warm washcloth.</p> <p>"Mmmhmm. I think you're ready enough now." She then put the washcloth up to my mouth to get it a little wet.</p> <p>"This is so wonderful, but what about you? Did you enjoy it?"</p> <p>"Yes. It was incredible. I've never felt anything like that before." I said quietly.</p> <p>She then took my hand and gently led me to the bathroom. I was looking at the huge mirror directly in front of me as she sat down to wash my hair. The look on her face was so beautiful that I almost thought she was looking into the mirror in front of us.</p> <p>"I just want to make sure that we get this all the way to the back of your mind at least, okay?" she asked me, smiling sweetly.</p> <p>"Yes I think so. I don't know what I would do if we could be together like this." I replied.</p> <p>"Of course we can." She responded with a loving smile.</p> <p>"I hope you're not upset... that we just can't do this."</p> <p>"Well I'm not. I don't know, maybe some other point." I replied. "But you're right, I am a believer in the Lord.... for me to share my body with you... is wonderful."</p> <p>"Well I didn't know, but... you're right. We should probably wash ourselves... before we go ahead."</p> <p>She soaped me up and then slid her soapy finger down through my pussy and gently massaged me while I watched her.</p> <p>"This is really nice, Michael....," she said looking up at me. "Isn't it?"</p> <p>"I'm glad it is."</p> <p>She started by gently massaging my clit. A drop of lube appeared to dribble in at the bottom of her hand, and then she took the finger and lubed up around and up between my pussy lips.</p> <p>The closer I got to my orgasm, the more it felt like she didn't even penetrate me. It was so intense that I was ready to explode, just in time so I could feel her warm hands pressing gently down onto my mound.</p> <p>"Oh God... Ooooohh...." was all that I could gasp, as I came hard, her finger deep inside me.</p> <p>My orgasm lasted about 60 seconds of my first time in the shower. It felt like the orgasmic experience of a lifetime, and the fact that we were together was so powerful. I was very aware of how it felt when she held me like this for what felt like forever. My whole body was in rapturesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
