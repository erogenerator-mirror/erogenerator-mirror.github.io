The thought of her begging for it seemed to ignite my libido.</p> <p>"Hurry up and get your finger inside me NOW!" she yelled.</p> <p>I didn't need her urging for my fingers to enter her pussy, which made me even stronger and more powerful.</p> <p>"Ahhhhhh, your pussy feels so good." With these words, I pushed my fingers all the way into her until I could feel her hymen, a large membrane of nerves.</p> <p>"Just push harder!" she yelled</p> <p>"Please, please, fuck me with your finger."</p> <p>With those simple words on her lips, all my power was sucked out of me, my cock was buried deep into her pussy. And I continued to fuck her while she begged me for more.</p> <p>With the last two orgasms hitting, I could no longer hold back. My cock was so full with my fingers, I couldn't hold back any longer. My cock started erupting my sperm into her pussy.</p> <p>After I had finished shooting, I pulled out and lay down beside her. Our bodies covered by the sheets, I caressed her breasts, belly and face.</p> <p>"I can still feel your juices inside me, it was worth it. But now I think we need to go home."</p> <p>"We already have that, don't we?"</p> <p>"No you don't!"</p> <p>"Then why did you let me do it?"</p> <p>"You have a wicked side. I was going to make you cum and then do it again."</p> <p>"You're going to make me cum again too..."</p> <p>But by then we were ready.</p> <p>"I'm ready!" I said, and kissed her. We made love for some time, while I fondled, played with her body, caressing her body and especially her pussy. I could feel her warm heart beating at the same tempo as mine. We never could have achieved the feeling that day.</p> <p>During the next few weeks we continued to make love on many occasions, each day better than the day before. Although we always talked, we never had any sex on the weekends, instead fucking ourselves silly. And I knew a lot about her, but I thought I hadn't found that out yet.</p> <p>We both went to school together, and enjoyed it together like long-time friends. Her high school was different than mine, it was more like ours, which was perfect too. As she got out of school, she went to a different school in New York, where she had her own place, for her classes that were less demanding.</p> <p>After a short time, I decided I would visit her school in New York. My love of her had grown, even I was worried it was not the same as when I was with her. As I was there, it was like no more. Maybe it was wrong or just not right for me, but all I knew was that her love and feelings were good.</p> <p>I went for a walk and she did too. It was as if it was one giant leap on my life. With her in close proximity, I felt more than alive and happy, and we were happy too. We were both free and alive with each other and were happy, too.</p> <p>"I wish you will visit my hometown again. I wish it was not as good as yours."</p> <p>"I want you to always visit my hometown," I said, "I want to never leave it."</p> <p>"I'll always try to call you, but if you want your own, I'm sure we can have a lot more of fun together." She smiled.</p> <p>I really hoped it would be so, which was, I thought, it would be just a one time thing.</p> <p>But after that night, I thought about what happened between me and her. After a long, intense affair, I couldn't stand feeling the loss of her love. My love for her seemed to never fade.</p> <p>I still wanted her to know about me, but couldn't find any other way to do that.</p> <p>My love for her was different from her boyfriend, who, while a good person, was never the same person. She loved me in a way I had never loved her before. We were a big pair. We were the same kind of person.</p> <p>"Tell me about this special time with you," I said, and smiled.</p> <p>"That too may lead to nothing. I'm yours... I really am... I'm totally yours to do with as you want."</p> <p>"But, I have to admit that I've been dreaming for so long about you being my girlfriend...."</p> <p>"Well, yes, of course you have.... It's only when I'm with you that I think about you," I said, "I can't deny my lust for you. But I reallyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
