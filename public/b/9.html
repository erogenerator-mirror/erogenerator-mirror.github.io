His voice sounded deep and thick. Maybe I wanted more? He was so sure that he was ready to play, so forceful with his words. The words and the tone of his voice were so hot and sexy, I wanted them so badly. He wanted me all to himself and I wouldn't be in a rush. "I'll see to it you cum. You're going to be sore all week from sucking off my cum, that's going to make up for my fucking. I'll be fucking you with it until you can't sit. I want you to be as tight as me. Just tell me when you're going to cum and I'll be there to bring you off."</p> <p>"I'm going to cum right here," I said in a husky whisper.</p> <p>Then as I felt it shoot through me I heard him say my name again, "And again" as he came on my face and mouth. He knew how hot and wet I was, how I got wet all the time. I thought of his fingers running up and down my slit, how wet my wetness was, and how he slipped a finger up to tease me, I moaned with need. I didn't say anything else. I was lost in the moment. He kissed me back deeply and I tasted the first traces of his juices.</p> <p>Soon as his lips left mine, I pushed my tongue between his lips and tried to taste some more. We had our first taste of him, together. He was delicious and I didn't care. As our tongues fought to play, he was so hot. I felt like an innocent student kissing her French boyfriend, and in the back of my mind I wondered what she would expect to be told off.</p> <p>Soon after I tasted him, he broke the kiss and his eyes were closed. His mouth was open, his lips smeared with his own cum. He was panting with my own passion and it made me hot and sexy to know such a primal expression of lust had come out upon him. His dick twitched and jumped like a jack-hammer against his stomach. He groaned with desire to have more of its hot juice inside of me.</p> <p>"You are a sweet tasting little angel. If I had a dick it would have to be deep in your juicy little pussy, or up my ass right now." My eyes got very wide at that, it felt so good to be sexy to him, so much hotter, more wilder and intense than the rest of my body. To feel him inside me again was even more intense. It was so intense, I think his own body responded by wanting more of me.</p> <p>I kissed his ear. "Are you okay?" I wasn't sure but it was definitely turning him on, and he started bucking and pushing against me, his dick so hard it was throbbing. He didn't say anything but his breathing was ragged and his hips were going crazy. I reached up and touched his dick and squeezed.</p> <p>"I'm a little sore, I need to catch my breath," I said, and he groaned.</p> <p>"No wait," he stopped my hand and began rubbing me again. "Let me put a condom on that one."</p> <p>Suddenly he said his voice husky, "There's a second one in here," and then he ran through another door into the bedroom. When he came back, he held a condom and said, "Lie down baby." I looked on with a surprised expression as I watched him reach down and open the drawer that held those kinds of things. There were little condoms, they had to go around my waist. He put it to me and started slowly kissing me. "I'm not going to fuck you. I want to make love with you." His kisses were wild and insistent as he held my lips, our tongues flailed. He made me dizzy from the strength of his kissing, and I wanted it to last forever.</p> <p>But his hands reached under my back and I knew he really wanted to do this. I wanted to feel his hard throbbing cock inside me but I wanted all of him too. He kissed down my neck to my collarbone and then on through the shoulder blades and back again. I thought he would put the penis of another guy in my pussy again, but instead he reached both hands around my breasts. He put the tip of the condom on the tip of his shaft with his left hand and I felt his fingers slowly rubbing my erect clit that was sticking out under the fabric of his shorts. I reached down and pulled myself towards him. "You are so fucking hot, and so fucking wet."</p> <p>He put both hands on his hips and moved to get to me. "Wait. I'm not gonna fuck you. I just wanted to get you hot for me." His hand went back to my mound and started massaging my clâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
