On my way out I stopped and looked around; it was now or never. I grabbed the bag I was carrying and got out the key cards and I walked across the deck to the pool.</p> <p>I picked it up and walked around the deck and picked up a couple of bottles of wine. I sat the bottle on a lawn chair and sat down beside the pool. I couldn't help but watch as the sun was beginning to set. I don't think I took about two or three glasses of wine; it was starting to be chilly. After a couple of minutes I decided I needed to go to the bathroom, when I came back out, I turned around and started my shower. It was warm out and it felt good to just have a little comfort. I could feel every drop of water as it came out of the showerhead and I got as close to what I was looking for as I could.</p> <p>I had a lot of wine at the pool by then and was feeling no pain when I got out of the shower. I walked back inside the house, and grabbed my bottle.</p> <p>All of a sudden it hit me I was walking into something; I wasn't a big drinker, but this bottle of wine felt good and I started to drink a little harder. I was just about to sit down to another glass of wine when I heard the door to the bathroom open. It was her.</p> <p>"Hey!" I said out loud.</p> <p>"Hi honey," she responded.</p> <p>I walked around the chair and leaned over next to her. As she had said before, she smelled like a man so no one would ask me to stay for dinner. I wasn't a stranger to women, except for a man who liked to suck me off, but I liked men too. "You're back!" I said excitedly.</p> <p>I heard her say something, then she just stood up and walked over to me. She took my glass from my hand and put it in the trash. She took both hands and held them out in front of me. I didn't stop her, I had to have her now.</p> <p>She stood back down between us, and looking me in the eye she reached out and touched my lips with her finger. She just said, "Come."</p> <p>This kiss was like a drug to me and I started to kiss it back. I was so excited at the way she kissed that I lost all self control completely. I almost didn't pull the lips away when suddenly she pulled me down and started to kiss me, full on the mouth and tongue, my neck and chest. I loved it. I couldn't believe I was doing this - kissing another woman. I felt a hand slide into my panties and touch my sex.</p> <p>I felt my body respond as she rubbed my wetness and moved it gently to my clit and then I was ready, all over again. Her hands moved to my back, her fingers gently holding my ass and rubbing me. My breathing was coming in short bursts at that point and she started to kiss down my neck and to my breast, then she was sucking my nipple and then her fingers were moving further down and sliding across my pussy and up and down. My breath was coming out in gasps, and her finger just slid between my lips. After about five seconds of that exquisite assault her finger moved back to my clit and she rubbed that for a moment then started to move again. I felt my hands go back to her hips, and my fingers were now rubbing against her ass, and it felt good. It was like I'd let myself go, and I didn't want it to stop.</p> <p>She pulled back and looked me in the eye and said, "Well, I guess I'm going to have to get rid of some of this." She pushed my shoulders up and turned me around and sat me down on the kitchen table. Then she leaned over and undid my bra.</p> <p>I felt my bra loose and dropped it to the floor. Now, I felt her hand pull my panties down, but I still didn't have anything on. All I had to do was get them off and I was naked on the dining room table with my legs open giving her unfettered access to my sex. I felt the tip of her tongue against my pussy lips again and it was as good as the first. I was going to have to be careful not to cum before I got to my orgasm.</p> <p>"Wow!" I heard her say.</p> <p>She continued to lick all around my clit making me gyrate around on the table. She kept up the tortuous pace, sucking it in, licking and biting it as it made me feel pleasure and pain. Then she moved her tongue down lower into my pussy, the tip of her tongue right past my openingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
