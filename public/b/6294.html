"Will you forgive me?"</p> <p>"I forgive you," I grinned, "for everything. I have loved you all my life!"</p> <p>She was stunned, but she accepted my sincere declaration. And I made a wonderful life!</p> <p>"I know it was hard for us to arrange that, David, but I knew you would find me... well, someone," she smiled. "But you loved me no matter what!
