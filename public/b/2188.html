The thought of actually having sex with her was thrilling and I found I could also get my own release.</p> <p>But the more I went with it, the stronger my urge to find out more about her, to see more of her, to be more of her to me, to her.</p> <p>And she had just come back from a party with the girls, at my house. I was hoping to get into her knickers. She had come through the door very shortly with another girl to her house. That one of them had a strap-on. She had asked me to go and use it on her so I'd had my fingers there a while, making her wet. So I'd had her pussy so swollen that my fingers had slipped right in. One hand came around her belly to gently cup a breast.</p> <p>It was obvious the other girl was waiting on this. And she had obviously watched. And she was holding out her hand. And her fingers were in her own crotch at the time.</p> <p>But now my lust was rising. I wanted to tell her, to do something, but at the same time it would be cheating.</p> <p>I shook my head in disgust as I thought "That doesn't mean they're not playing. It's just that I don't know if she should."</p> <p>But I couldn't think of anything to say that would ease the way I felt. So I took my hand away and went on with my evening plans. I had booked at a wine tasting in an underground nightclub.</p> <p>I had taken a couple of hours to wait for her, taking time to eat, drink. Then we walked round to a table, where the girls were sitting all around her. They all talked about the night. That was fine, I thought. So I sat with them and drank up. And the girl that was talking on, was a short girl, about eighteen.</p> <p>And I watched her. And felt a warm flush sweep through me. So I just looked into her beautiful dark eyes. I had wanted to feel those eyes before.</p> <p>She was lovely. I felt I needed to get closer to her, just to feel her warmth.</p> <p>Then I felt a hand on the back of my head. And the other hand was on the front of my head. And I was kissing her cheek. I felt my head start to go south. We kissed. The soft lips to soft lips, with their moist mouths open, were mine like hers, and I opened hers again, this time with those lips on mine. Her lips were warm, full, and oh so wet, and I was kissing her there again. And she was making it wet, her tongue licking the back of my upper lip. And my tongue went into her mouth. And she was making noises, too, too. Oh the warmth of it was so exciting.</p> <p>And we were just like this. Our mouths were closed like those of a couple, kissing only with tongues. But at the same time our bodies were sliding and pressing against each other. And we were kissing, with our tongues as active as our hands on each other's mouth.</p> <p>And we were all wet and we were kissing. And we were both touching each other like that. I felt her fingers under my bra strap and she was feeling my breasts, making them feel full and smooth like the rest of me, the girl next to me had my blouse opened too. And suddenly I was feeling her breast, feeling her nipple as soft and smooth as the rest of her, feel the fleshy texture of it. So I opened her bra strap and her breast just looked lovely. I could feel it and so I felt her bra sliding along the skin beneath. I reached round her and felt her breasts for the first time and my fingers were on her bra strap. She'd been wearing a blouse and I knew my breasts but I just didn't know her full, soft breasts. Now I felt those breasts and I felt so excited and wanted her to feel them.</p> <p>But then we broke the kiss, and I took his finger, she could feel mine, and we brought a chair to sit on. The other girl put her hands on mine and we hugged. And we were kissing as passionately as two lovers do.</p> <p>I reached around him and I felt his penis in his pants. It was hard and hot and it felt hard. I felt so excited that I was going to go into her pants. But my legs felt rubbery, so I sat.</p> <p>And I took his hand, I felt his fingers on my pubic hairs. And I felt the lips of my vagina all of them under pressure. I felt so aroused by my own touch that I wanted to stroke him and stroke him over my own.</p> <p>And I had to hold his hands out, for his fingers moved too. And I slid itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
