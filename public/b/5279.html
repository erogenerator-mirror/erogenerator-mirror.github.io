You need to get over yourself. We are good." My mother nodded and pulled me into an embrace. After some time she whispered,</p> <p>"We are very lucky. Yes, there is a way. I think our lives are going to change. No one needs to know."</p> <p>The rest of the evening was spent at my mothers home enjoying wine, dinner, and a lot more sexual encounters. There was no hurry. There was no hurry. Not when I had a chance. There was only two things I wanted, at least with my own daughter. The first, was to spend the remainder of her life as the perfect woman.</p> <p>I knew mom was right. After all, she was right about everything. And that had been the same for us from the very first. It was as if she was the same as us for the last six weeks as we were getting ready for our big day. I had always been her only. I knew she would never let that stop us from having our sexual lives with her. It was just a matter of time until our hearts were set.</p> <p>I don't remember going through my day like that. What came to be clear was that at seven in the morning, I pulled my car around and went to sleep.</p> <p>I awoke to the alarm and got up as quickly as possible. I quickly showered, dressed, and went home. At home, I didn't even see mom. For a moment I thought that she had not been there. I guess she had been at work for a few hours. After all, the phone went off. I knew. She had finally gotten a chance to talk to me after this morning's events.</p> <p>I didn't call mom but I sent a text. "Hello!" I read from my message. "Yes. It's mom. I had a nice time."</p> <p>I thought to myself 'This has been a very interesting day for me. If only she would talk to me. If only she could keep being there. Then I'd have a wonderful future'.</p> <p>I put myself over the edge and thought of her many different ways to keep her. And to keep us in a state of bliss. The words that came came, "Mommy, mommy, mommy is coming home soon. She's coming homeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
