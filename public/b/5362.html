She saw my expression of panic. "It's not as bad as you think?"</p> <p>"Oh, I think it's better," I said softly. "It's not like there could be anything wrong with us, if there were other people out there... I've never been with a human before."</p> <p>"Oh... I... well, it's different now... and it scares me too. That's why I want to be with you," she said. And in almost two days, the fear started to get old and faded. I'd seen it a lot since this happened. It's almost as easy for humans to hate each other, but not them.</p> <p>"Maybe," she said with a shrug. "But at the same time, we need you so much now. If we can't do this right and we don't care whether those people stay or leave, then what's left to us is something different."</p> <p>I was so relieved. I felt like I could have been the one out of the closet for my whole life. I felt like I was the person. In that moment, I'd changed so much I'd barely changed at all. I wasn't a woman anymore. I was a girl. She was just a girl, or at least a girl she's been attracted to. She was so pretty I wanted to hug her. I wanted to kiss her, lick inside her tight little slit... but for all I knew, this might be all just my own crazy self-made fantasy, and if she did stay... well, that wouldn't be happening.</p> <p>"You're all I ever dreamed about now, sweetie," and we clung to each other, both trying to get as close as possible. "I... never even... you know..."</p> <p>"Don't say that about your own self," she said, putting her hand in mine. "I'll do anything for you if you just tell me... that's how I feel."</p> <p>I didn't think I'd ever been so lucky to have a warm and loving girlfriend again, but just holding her felt so much better. It made my own weird feeling for her feel stronger somehow, and maybe it even made sense to me too. That feeling got so much stronger for the time we spent together it seemed as if all I could think about was how I could kiss her... how I would do anything to make her feel the way she was feeling for me. I could just lay here and be with her forever, in a state like this.</p> <p>I really wanted to do whatever she made me do, and it was a nice dream to be sharing with her, but... the weird feeling was starting to go away. Her hand started to move lightly in my hair, as if trying to get me to do something. In those few moments, it felt as if she were caressing my scalp, and she pressed her hand into my upper back a bit, causing me to relax the muscles all the more.</p> <p>"I think you're all I ever wanted to be," she said softly. "And that's because I..." She was so close I could feel her breath touching me. "That's all I ever needed. I never thought this could feel so good..."</p> <p>I had to laugh at the thought, but I was too busy trying to find words to respond. Finally, she let go of my hand, and she turned and kissed me, her own kiss, a soft peck, at least in her world-view, but the lightest kiss was her idea of paradise.</p> <p>We lay on the bed a while longer, exploring each other, feeling each other's body heat, listening to the sound of our own heart beats and our own wet breaths, when I suddenly realized what I had thought my life was, and what I'd been made to believe, at least.</p> <p>"I love you, Ellie," I said at the time. A lot, I decided afterwards.</p> <p>"I love you, too," she said. "Now, let me do something for you." And suddenly, she was naked. There was never any hesitation about it. Her body was as beautiful as I've always imagined or dreamed it might be... and she didn't take any time for it; she simply sat there next to me, not in the least, but on top of me, her head just resting on my shoulder.</p> <p>"I... I've never felt anything like this," she said, and we both laughed again. We were so happy we hadn't even started. I think I almost wanted to cry... so excited I could barely breathe. Then, when I thought I couldn't take any more, the worry cleared for me.</p> <p>"Yeah..." I said. "I feel nothing, but I can feel you...
