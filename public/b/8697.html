Is your mom in trouble?"</p> <p>"No. She just got a divorce. The husband wanted to get married and I was upset because I didn't. I just didn't want him getting hurt because of me."</p> <p>"Then what?"</p> <p>"Then what caused that divorce?" she said with anger in her voice.</p> <p>"My fault."</p> <p>She stared at me for a long moment as if trying to force me to answer her, but she just stood there.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm coming," she snapped.</p> <p>As she ran to her bedroom, I waited impatiently for her to come back. Finally, she came back and gave me a stern look but not without anger burning my guts.</p> <p>"I'm so sorry and no, it didn't happen. I don't want to lose you. Don't ever doubt my faith in you," she said with a sad smile.</p> <p>I had to admit, I felt betrayed, but I knew there was nothing I could do about it now. It was my fault that he wanted to get married, and if he really does want to marry me, then I can't blame him for that. She was right and I should have let her win that fight or, with all that happened, there hadn't been anything more to it.</p> <p>"No. Don't say anything of this just yet. You have nothing to blame, but I just didn't stop him."</p> <p>"Well, if I wanted it to stop, I would have kept going. If I'd stopped him, I wouldn't be with you right now."</p> <p>"No. I mean, you could always just call, but I couldn't keep away from you. I would have been all alone if Mike didn't see me."</p> <p>"I don't know about that," I said quietly. "But that was different. My life should just have ended with you in it. I'd probably have made it better because it was my fault that happened."</p> <p>"I know, I know, you think I should have let him get married and have some kind of happy life," she said. She reached into her room and grabbed the phone and dialed Mike.</p> <p>"Hello?" Mike answered at first, not knowing where this was going.</p> <p>"Hi," she said. "It's me. How's things going?"</p> <p>He said nothing. He looked at her and then she started laughing.</p> <p>"What'd you do to that poor guy so soon?"</p> <p>"Nothing. Everything went fine. He's an old friend," he said. "Not anymore. He just didn't want you to see how unhappy he was. So, he called and asked me to come over."</p> <p>"And I thought?"</p> <p>"He wanted to marry me because his wife didn't want to give up his baby," he said. "I was just thinking of you and wishing that you were a little closer."</p> <p>He was quiet after that.</p> <p>"I didn't have to go there, but Mike would have done it. I can just imagine how your life would have been if he had done it alone."</p> <p>"If he'd come over, would you have cheated on me with him again?"</p> <p>She leaned forward and kissed my cheek. I wasn't sure what it felt like, how to respond, but there was an undeniable lust and it just happened. As she turned to leave the room, she leaned into me and kissed my cheek softly.</p> <p>"I don't really love him anymore. Mike isn't what is commonly known as a rebound girl."</p> <p>"That makes sense. I think of you as one. Did he make you something, what?"</p> <p>"No. I think it was just us that went crazy."</p> <p>"I wouldn't have taken it any further."</p> <p>That brought her back to her point, but I couldn't figure it out.</p> <p>"When Mike told me to come visit, I said I was going to try to get myself through this thing, but he said he wouldn't hurt me. I couldn't tell him it was because of what we did together. He said I had to wait until you had to get back home to take care of the kids and that was just his way to keep me out so I wouldn't be tempted to do something to make you upset. So, I think he tried a line in that case and maybe I'll call him tomorrow," she said, looking down at the floor.</p> <p>"What line was he trying to draw?"</p> <p>"Do you really wanna know? There's not a lot of ground to cover."</p> <p>"That's right. I'm so sorry."</p> <p>"But it was a line," she said. "He could have tried something else, even if he'd never given you the time ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
