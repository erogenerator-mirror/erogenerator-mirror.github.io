The bartender had been there before and the other person was a few minutes, so I ordered a beer, which by then, I knew had something to do. Everyone had a drink, and everyone was drinking me, including myself. I liked it, and I decided to have a little fun with it.</p> <p>We had another couple in the booth next to us who were already on the dance floor, dancing on their own. A few minutes later, I felt a hand on my ass. And it went lower until it was on my thigh right up under the hem of my skirt. It was a good thing that it was still dark, because I wasn't wearing any panties either, because both men and women began to get really busy in front of me. I could tell that it was too much already. I didn’t care, and was soon gushy, so I took a beer from the bar, drank it (it was not hard), smiled at the crowd (we knew it would not take much). I knew what was expected of me; I was the type of woman to do it, and I did. I began to have myself a little light headed as we danced, and I couldn’t quite get that far. I was a little embarrassed that I was so wet by now, as this wasn’t as much fun as I had imagined. However, I enjoyed myself in the bar and didn’t care, so I kept on enjoying myself.</p> <p>Soon I began to feel a hand on my ass again, and the man had moved his hand higher. It was all I could do to continue to dance with him, until he was just below the waistband of my skirt, and his hand seemed to come around from below. I couldn’t feel his hand, but I knew that it was moving over my ass, and then he would move his hand slowly, sliding it under the elastic of my panties, until his fingers went up inside of me. I was sure I had to have my hands in his pants now, and it wouldn’t be long before I got up and leave the dance floor so I could let them have their way with me. We had a couple of other guys close by, with their wives or girlfriends right by us.</p> <p>I had been dancing, so I was getting ready to leave when the third man asked me to get him a drink. He came up to me, and we kissed, and I don’t think that my knees went weak at the kiss. It was a kind of a "fuck and run" kind of kiss, and if I had had more time, then he must have slipped his hand down my leg. I was really enjoying myself, and he had never been this aggressive with me before. What a guy. I really, really didn’t care if I wanted to stay in that public place with him, anyway. I could feel his erection in his pants as we were having our kiss. I felt the man behind me take both hands from my hips and take mine, and pull them both up around his waist. I then lifted both my hands and guided them to his cock. We had a little discussion there.</p> <p>I don’t think that anyone at the bar saw we were doing it, either; but I think that most of them just smiled at our little game, and seemed to like it. I got my hands around his neck and kissed him on the chin and cheeks and then, taking his hand, placed it on my inner thigh, and slid a finger up into my wetness. He slipped it in and out with ease, and then started to slide it back out, while I continued to rub his cock. I took his finger out from my pussy, and placed it beside my mouth, where I could catch a drop of my nectar. I licked it off and whispered that I liked it, and that I’ve had a few before.</p> <p>Another man began to have himself another round of me in front of the whole place; one of the other men came up and asked again if I wanted another beer with this guy. I agreed, and we drank our third, and then another before getting out of there to let the guys have their fun. When we returned to our booth, his name was Bill, and I saw his wife and their friend dancing as they did in there—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
