It's too late again, and you need to come home."</p> <p>Gwen gave him a look of disgust that he thought would disappear quickly if she didn't get out of her clothes by sunrise. She grabbed the top of her dress to try and hide her modesty. "No, it's fine. It's just," she started to say again, realizing that not being dressed meant that she could not see anything, and that she could probably be seen in the street by the police.</p> <p>"Come on, we need to put you up at this flat before the end of the month."</p> <p>Gwen had seen a sign that said, "Cab". It was the sort of sign someone would have used for advertising in this country only, and when a couple went in with a guy, it always gave a message. She hated the way she was going to be walking in her car from now on because that would mean walking into the street in her own clothes.</p> <p>As they got through the front door they both could feel the heat of arousal burning and their bodies were covered by more layers of clothing. If anyone would have called "dressing" up her way a little too fancy for her clothes, it may have been a compliment.</p> <p>Gwen was glad, knowing she would have to be naked at least a few more months if she was to survive. She was feeling warm, despite the cold that was starting to seep into her body. She could sense her nipples already hardening under her thin shirt.</p> <p>As they started to undress Gwen had to stop herself from laughing at his looks as he pushed his trousers and boxers off. It was as if she could still sense a smile in his eyes when her hand was already there to pull them off. He was completely naked, which was a relief because her own clothes had been in the flat for the last couple of months. And since she had not been able to wear more than that last time, she was in the middle of taking her panties off as she slowly peeled them off. She did not want to disappoint him.</p> <p>"How does your body look?"</p> <p>Gwen looked back at him as he stood watching her. She knew she could feel the heat in her body again, and it made her want to get her clothes off faster. "I feel different. It's hot."</p> <p>"Are you cold?"</p> <p>"No, but you're going to see that it's nice."</p> <p>Gwen knew she could probably manage to keep her body heated for the first time in a while, but her nerves had gotten the better of her. She was sure he had noticed this all along. They both knew it.</p> <p>Gwen's body was starting to sweat as she started to remove her bra and pull her blouse over her head. It wasn't as bad as her panties were feeling, but it still felt as if she was burning and not very comfortable. She was also glad that his eyes kept glancing down at her as she turned to face him. It also allowed her nipples to still be very prominent, but it was almost too much to bear.</p> <p>The fact that he did it made it that much more awkward. She didn't want to look too badly at his erection, she just wanted to see what he looked like. He wasn't quite as long as Michael, but still a decent size. She had had her share of boyfriends in college, but this guy was a lot better looking than that, and she really wanted to see what he looked like naked, because of what his expression looked like.</p> <p>Her hands got her blouse and her bra and she helped him slide the panties and bra off while he looked. At least he still had the underwear on after her last boyfriend had had his way with her. He wasn't nearly as skinny as Michael, but that didn't mean she couldn't find it easy to stare. His erection didn't just look huge, it looked enormous.</p> <p>"I'm sorry I was so quick when I came in," she blurted after she finished her bra.</p> <p>"Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you," he said, reaching out and placing his hand over her breast. "You have a beautiful body and I thought I was going to..." His voice trailed off as he saw her expression, but before this time he didn't care.</p> <p>"Oh, you can," she said, trying to keep her breasts covered. "There's nothing to be sorry about," she said, squeezing his hand. Their relationship had been rocky for the past few months. "At least I'm not going to put it all back together."</p> <p>Gwen started to stand up, but just then Michael picked her up and put him on his back. Gwen had expected to have to use the top of her bra to cover everything so it only caused an awkward angleâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
