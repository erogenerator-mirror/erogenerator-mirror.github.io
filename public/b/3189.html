She said</p> <p>Then he kissed her and took her back into the house.</p> <p>She went to the bathroom and sat down. She looked at herself in the mirror. Her hair was still wet, her eyes had been wetting a little so that they looked a little red. Her lips looked red and swollen. She looked and smelled faintly of perfume, soap, and deodorant. Oh god, she thought.</p> <p>Finally she got up, went to her closet and came out with the cleanest, cutest, and hottest outfit that she had ever worn. She got her outfit out, put it on, and walked out into the night. She made quick work of getting ready.</p> <p>It was an old, worn old, old nightie. It looked worn-out. It still had a little bit of lace around the front, something that you would never wear for this sort of evening. It was the kind of dress you always looked at from afar, and didn't know for sure exactly what sort of body it really was.</p> <p>She was wearing three layers of that and her underwear right now. And there weren't two colors on there; she had no way of knowing which. A matching bra, for her left breast. And a tiny thong, for her right breast. It made her skin look soft. The white of the fabric rubbed on her body and made her nipples hard and warm.</p> <p>She knew from the way she was getting ready that it would stay on all night, and the way she was feeling with it, because she knew that if I didn't take it off I would go crazy. She had gotten a little bolder since the game yesterday.</p> <p>She took off the thong, her hips were turning a little too red, but she didn't care. She slid off the thong and slid into a clean white, tight tank top that was a little too small for her. The top went all the way to her collar bone, her nipples were sticking through as if they were ready to burst.</p> <p>With one hand she pulled on her hair and the other one went to her right breast where the bra was holding it up and out. She turned to her left, turning around with the top on her left hip and pulled her ass cheeks out a little.</p> <p>Her thong was tight, and it would probably get back between her legs if she didn't have it on. She pulled it up over her thighs and put on a pair of long, black, sheer, sexy, thigh high, hose. She put on some high heeled, black, high heeled shoes and she came back out to see how the nightie looked. It made her nipples, too, and it showed a lot of thigh more than she normally did and made her a lot of cleavage just looking, so there would be a little cleavage if she got her breasts up high.</p> <p>"How do I look?" She asked.</p> <p>It was her first time speaking to a woman other then her lover, not to the guy that she was playing with tonight. And, she still had her blouse on and a little bit of makeup to go with it, and not the black outfit that was still wet to well.</p> <p>He had looked. It was not a pretty sight but he had seen her look and she had liked him looking at her.</p> <p>It turned her on and made her wet down there too.</p> <p>Then she went back and put on a white, lace, sheer, white, short, sleeveless, push-up, push up bra. It didn't really cover much, but she had tried to keep it covered in there, but she had come to a realization of the nightie that her breasts were getting all over the place, and that some of them were spilling out and that was pretty hard to see from the top of the bra anyway without looking over the top. And, it was a little higher than she usually would wear for this type of party, and she knew she could get a little more attention with that.</p> <p>She looked and saw that all of the guys were looking her. She liked that. She liked that she looked sexy tonight. She liked that everyone was looking her that she was making her feel.</p> <p>"Thank you, thank you." She said, then took her bra off and placed it in the bag. It was so small she had only been going out for a little while.</p> <p>She went back and sat down and picked up the bag and went to a window and looked out. She looked out to the street, saw people walking and other cars in the neighborhood. She saw two guys she knew, and they looked at her. She did too! She looked down at herself, then looked down again. She picked up the bag again. Then looked down.</p> <p>Finally she put onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
