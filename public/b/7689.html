I've got places I could be, and I've got an old house to myself."</p> <p>I felt tears stream down my face. This is going to be the best year of my life. I've finally gotten over my pain of losing my dad. I'm no longer a "baby", and it's over. I'm not going anywhere. I can only hope this doesn't happen again. The things she told me have helped me through tough times.</p> <p>This is it. I'm going to go on a trip, maybe I'll see my father again, and I'll find myself living on my own. I have no friends to confide in anymore, and no one to talk to about my problems. It feels like there is no life for me anymore, and I am just a piece of meat, stuck in this small hole.</p> <p>*â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
