"You can tell us how much you love a big cock."</p> <p>Sidney's tongue began to work its magic as he worked his hand into her panties. His hand soon found its way into the soft crack of her vagina. It was an eager move, and he was sure his fingers slid easily into her silky tunnel.</p> <p>Sidney began to feel a little guilty for being so bold, a little inexperienced, a little embarrassed. It was all the excuse he could make to continue exploring her body. "Oh, god," he thought. "So innocent. Just so innocent. It won't feel wrong if it's real. Nothing was done. It will feel natural." He let his hand wander further up, under the hem of her panties. His fingers found their way under the softness of her bush to just below her clitoris. He gently rubbed the area under her hood, pressing and feeling.</p> <p>Sidney had stopped sucking her breasts to concentrate on her pussy. She seemed as excited as he was. "Hee, I'm just about to get lost in that nice, big cock of yours," she teased.</p> <p>"Hah. Sorry," he said, pretending to be sincere. "Well I certainly hope so."</p> <p>"I'm not sorry. That's a wonderful thing to do. I love it."</p> <p>Sidney continued sucking on her breast while he worked his fingers deeper into the opening to her tunnel. He was able to get a finger and his thumb under the hood and he pushed it up through her cunt lips, feeling her clit as it slid across it.</p> <p>Suddenly he saw the lights go off in the room. It was after 5 now, and there was the oddest sound in the world.</p> <p>"Oh, god!" she exclaimed. "That was so freaky!"</p> <p>"I don't know what made me come in that awful motel," he told her. "All of this must be so nice...!"</p> <p>"We've gone this far," she said. "I think we're at the top of the world. You can do anything you want. Here, let me take your hand and help you out of that little room," she said, pulling his head up to hers.</p> <p>She put the head of his hard cock to her lips and gave it a long, languid lick from base to tip. He was glad to see her tongue on the head of his cock, even if it had only just been in his mouth. She looked up into his eyes with her big brown ones, giving him a wink. Her hand started to stroke him as she licked his shaft.</p> <p>"Suck me," he told her. "Suck me until I cum. Then I want to fuck you."</p> <p>"You can't fuck me, big guy," she said, grinning. "You're too big for me. I won't even do it once." She started to pull off his cock, and for a minute he thought she was going to pull it back in her mouth.</p> <p>"No. Now lie down on the table," she said. He did as she said, lying on his back and watching her as she squatted over his cock, the head disappearing in the hot, wet tunnel.</p> <p>She slid down on him slowly. As she did so, her eyes closed, and her head tilted backwards. This was so much better than fucking, she thought. He was able to enjoy her without making her feel like a whore.</p> <p>In spite of her inexperience, she soon found herself thrusting back at him, determined to make him cum. She was very happy to hear him moan or scream. "Mmm, yes. Just like that. Don't try and make it harder, baby. Just like that."</p> <p>As the thrusting went on and on, she got quieter. She began to breathe deeply again, and felt a sense of satisfaction at having made him feel good. It wasn't long before she became aware that she was going to make this guy cum too soon. She let him come into her mouth for a few seconds just before he cried out like a wounded bird.</p> <p>When her head started to clear, she stood up, looking down at the guy who was grinning at her. "Wow," she said. "That was fun. This is the closest I've come to fucking like this." She moved over him to kiss him on the mouth, not wanting to let his cum taste like lipstick on it. "I'm still a little sore, though," she added. "But that was niceâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
