"Are you getting ready to cum again?"</p> <p>"Yeah," I replied.</p> <p>"Okay, now," he said, taking my hand and placing it on his cock. "Do you think you're ready for another one?"</p> <p>"I'm so ready," I said.</p> <p>He looked at me and smiled. "Good."</p> <p>He took out his fingers again and slowly made his way up my thigh, to my aching pussy.</p> <p>"Oh, god," I groaned, feeling the hard tip rubbing my pussy lips. "I'm so wet," I murmured. "I need this."</p> <p>"That's pretty good," he said, reaching down and grabbing my thigh again. "Do you know you love being fucked like this?"</p> <p>That really set me off. I began to move faster when he brought his hand up and slapped my hand.</p> <p>"No," I groaned. He slapped me again.</p> <p>"Are you ready?" I asked. "I could wait all night."</p> <p>"Only for you. I'm so ready." I leaned down, pushing his legs towards his chest and sliding over the edge of the desk. I stood up and he slid up on his knees as he pulled me with him. I fell down onto it, pushing up with my thighs to meet his.</p> <p>He was standing in front of me, his hard cock jutting out at me, rubbing against my thighs. I wrapped my arms around his shoulders and moved closer. "I want to feel you inside me," I said. "I need it now!"</p> <p>He kissed my neck as he lifted my skirt up and over my hips. I had only worn blue jeans for work - a white button down shirt that I had left on the seat when I had left out in the rain - but with that skirt off now, he looked like a hiker. I sat up and let my legs hang off the desk, as he looked up into my eyes. He dropped my skirt in favor of getting his belt off. His hands immediately followed the bottom of my shirt, undoing each button as he undid the knot to unzip it. It took only seconds for my shirt to drop away down my body, leaving me exposed for him.</p> <p>I felt him shift forward on the desk as he stepped out of the pants. His knees were pressed against mine, his cock resting against my thigh a few inches above my head. My mouth opened slightly, inviting him, my tongue sliding out to taste him.</p> <p>He pressed his hard cock between my soft, wet lips. I could feel it slowly slide in, pushing at my teeth. My tongue slid out to swirl around the head as it slid into me and tasted the salt of the sweat on him. He tasted like heaven to me. His head was hot against the back of my throat and we moved slightly to slide it in and out over and over as he pushed up into me. He was moving his shaft deep inside me.</p> <p>He started thrusting hard and fast until I couldn't take it anymore. I slid forward slightly off his body, and took him deep into my mouth, sucking him tight as he slid into me again and again.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum," he groaned as my mouth held him and I felt him pulsing inside me. I felt the head on my tongue as it shot into me. I tightened my muscles around him, sucking and milking him, his cum filling my stomach as he began to pull himself away and I was able to swallow in time. I lay on the desk, his spent cock slipping between my lips on its way out.</p> <p>"That was incredible," he breathed, standing up. He reached down to pull the skirt up. "I know you could wait."</p> <p>"Just let me give you my room number," I replied. "I need to catch a bus back home, so I can get to work in peace." I smiled. "You have another hour before my bus gets here, so that's more than enough time to make me cum again."</p> <p>"Thanks," he said. "I was beginning to wonder if you were going to let me fuck you right here, in your bedroom."</p> <p>I stood on my tip toes and kissed him. I took his hands and pulled him to his feet. He helped me back up and I slid down to the floor beside the desk and we kissed again as his arm went around and grabbed the top of my shirt and lifted me off the floor. I wrapped my arms around him as we kissed. "That's kind of warm," I murmured.</p> <p>"Nah," he said. "I just love your ass!"</p> <p>We kissed some more, just long enough to feel himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
