Then he appeared, holding a small dish towel. He looked down at the towel. Then quickly went to the bathroom.</p> <p>I stood, slightly shocked. He was drying his hair. I noticed the hair-dryer nearby. I had expected the towel to touch his body, but not now. He held a razor in one hand and a towel in his other hand. He put the towel on a small stool at the small table on the other side of the room and started to remove the hair with his own hand. He touched the towel, then rubbed some cream on his upper and lower body. I could feel his body becoming warm, his erection growing even harder. He sat down by the tub.</p> <p>He did not say anything to me. He just stared at my nipples and his breathing became heavier, as my heart pounded between my shoulders.</p> <p>Then suddenly, he raised his hands and reached for the shower curtain.</p> <p>"I have decided. This is your chance." he said it coldly. He pulled the curtain behind him. And as he turned, he picked up the small towel. One hand went to his erection, while the other started to unbutton his shorts. He did not stop at all and was soon naked from waist to waist. I was shocked.</p> <p>His eyes were focused on my nipples, and my face. His hand cupped his erection. He looked deep and saw them swell and grow. He looked up.</p> <p>"I have had a change of heart. You do look like you feel good. How about you? Tell me what a naughty boy you are, and why you are so hard." he said this with a low voice. He was staring intently at my body. I had not expected his sudden, harsh treatment of me. His hands were now under my back. I felt his warm hands caressing and massaging my body. His hands roamed down to my thighs. He was now almost touching me. He was stroking my mound and my thighs, his breath on my ear, whispering in it.</p> <p>I felt myself becoming aroused.</p> <p>"I am not used to this," he said this, "and I don't think I can do anything with you, if you know what I mean. But I want to know your name. Call me by name.</p> <p>I agreed and turned to him. I wanted him to keep on talking.</p> <p>"I am Peter. My name is Anna."</p> <p>"I am glad you like my name, Peter."</p> <p>"That seems strange. I like that name. It sounds exciting. That name sounds exciting."</p> <p>"I do," I said smiling at him, "now you tell that story for me."</p> <p>He looked a bit puzzled, but I think he knew what I wanted him to do.</p> <p>"Peter said you liked to suck cock."</p> <p>"Suck cock? What are you talking about? Where did I hear that?" he sounded like he was confused.</p> <p>"Suck cock while the man you are thinking about sucking cock is fucking you. You have not sucked a cock before now has you?" I looked at his eyes and my body language. He had a smile on his face.</p> <p>"This is exciting," I said, "but I don't know how. I don't even know your name!"</p> <p>"I did not want to answer your question Anna? Are you gay?"</p> <p>"No. I'm not gay. I am just curious. I want to know the name of your lover."</p> <p>"Oh, you are always so open with me. I think you already did with the other boys, but I want this talk, don't you," he said this in a calm, matter of fact way.</p> <p>"I want this talk, too. I am not used to any of this. I want to see your naked body, Peter," I said, as he sat, looking away from me.</p> <p>"This is not right. You cannot think I am gay. You are a man and that is all I said. But I can see you looking at me naked. It makes me think about your cock. I like it when you look at me, as a woman. It makes me so hot when you see me. You are a beautiful person, Peter," I said, "I just want to talk. This is really happening."</p> <p>"I have to go. I like to talk with you. It's just that I am afraid of what might happen when I walk into the room and you go back to hiding in your room. What if it happens? I can call you before you leave. It might never happen, will it?"</p> <p>"This is hard. I'm scared. I don't want this to go too farâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
