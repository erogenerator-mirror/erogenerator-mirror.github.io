She arched her hips back, thrusting her pussy into my face as she came, gasping. I licked her again, this time feeling the warmth of her come coating my face as she came. After a few more thrusts of my tongue in her cunt my head started to move again, slowly. She pulled it from me and I raised my head up and was greeted by a smile. She turned around and straddled me, moving down and rubbing her pussy on my lips.</p> <p>"You know what I like." she whispered, as her tongue trailed over my lips to my ear. The wet, warm, wet feeling of her tongue and her fingers against my nipples was like nothing I had felt before. She started kissing me again, sucking my tongue, biting mine, and biting my chin, pulling her tongue back into my mouth. Her hands moved up to my chest and grabbed onto my nipples, squeezing and tugging them. I felt them getting harder as she pushed them out, and my nipples were achingly hard. I moaned in response as she continued thrusting her tongue into my mouth, fucking it with her fingers and her lips. My hands went to her ass and started to caress her through her pants, pulling them down, and caressing her bare, smooth and round ass. I pushed them down and let them come to rest in the crack between her ass and thighs. She looked at me with desire and lust in her eyes, pulling them up and bending them at the knees. I loved it when she did this, so forceful and powerful. I slid my hands along her panties and down the small of her ass, cupping it and lifting it to my face.</p> <p>"Take off your pants and kneel here, on the couch," she instructed, kneeling down beside me. I pulled off my pants and let them fall down around my feet. She grabbed hold of my rock hard dick and aimed it towards her mouth and she took me into her mouth as I started to sit back down. She reached out with one hand and grabbed my balls and slowly jerked them as she slid her mouth up and down my dick. I reached out and grabbed her ass, feeling it up and running my palm across her ass. She slid her tongue over the head of my dick and I groaned, she tasted so good. She leaned back and took me back into her mouth. I lifted my legs up to rest my calves on her shoulders, raising my ass off the couch so she could keep her face planted in my crotch. I felt my dick slide deeper and deeper inside of her as I felt her tongue swirling around my head. I felt so close to a release as she felt me growing in her mouth. I felt myself tense as I started to shoot my load down her throat. Her hands were holding me away from her as my orgasm subsided, trying to catch my breath.</p> <p>I finally recovered, and felt her get up, her hands going to her clothes. She pulled her blouse off and stood up, her skirt sliding back down and dropping to the floor. She took my hand and led me to the bedroom, where we both turned and dropped to the bed. She lay down and pulled me down with her and we fell asleepâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
