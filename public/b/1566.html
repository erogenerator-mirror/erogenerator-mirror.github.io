You made me feel that much better."</p> <p>"Well, thanks, babe. You're welcome."</p> <p>"Thanks for the ride. I wish I was driving. I'm glad you're here," she answered.</p> <p>"Hey, are we going to be in town until Tuesday?" he asked.</p> <p>"Sure. That's where I work. What are you up to?"</p> <p>"Just checking out the shops. I might be able to find you some clothes and things to wear. What kind of business is it in? Come on, let's take a swim!"</p> <p>He put a few clothes on his clothes and hopped in the pool. A few seconds later, he felt his body become warm and relaxed. He swam for a bit, then headed to the edge to find a book.</p> <p>The town of Redwood was an older part of town. It was close to where he lived with his parents. There were lots of restaurants and stores on the sidewalks, but the shops and other businesses were mostly the older parts of town. The beach was a lot more relaxed and it had more stores around it. It had a wide variety of food available in the shops and a lot of fish. He enjoyed the beach and was sure to enjoy the food later.</p> <p>He had no idea what time he got back to campus, so he just went out to his truck and checked out again. He checked several places on his list and decided on a pizza restaurant along a secluded stretch of coastline. He wanted to get the pizzeria as well as the restaurants and have them go in the same place. For the pizzeria, it was a huge deal.</p> <p>The pizzeria was a cozy place but not as crowded as he normally would have expected them to be. In it, people were busy, but mostly people were having fun. He walked around the pizza place, making notes in his book. His eyes never left the woman walking by, smiling, laughing, laughing. It occurred to him as they were passing him, that she was naked underneath her robe.</p> <p>"Whew." It was one thing to know something was going on about her, but something else never occurred to him. He was a guy, after all. She was his first experience in real-life, but, he told himself, she would let him find out more later. Now he was really on the cusp of feeling like it was a new experience.</p> <p>The owner of the pizza place looked up from his book. "Is that the pizza around here?"</p> <p>"Yeah, it's in the back."</p> <p>"I'll pay for it. Thanks for buying it."</p> <p>"No, thank you for paying. It's so nice of you to."</p> <p>"I'm glad you like it," he said. "It cost less. We should have done this a long time ago."</p> <p>"Oh yeah, sorry," she said.</p> <p>"That's okay," he said. "It's just that we're trying to have a good time here. I'm sure you'll just enjoy it."</p> <p>"I sure will. It's a lot of fun."</p> <p>"How about you?" he said as he started to walk towards her again.</p> <p>"Why don't you tell me what you have in your hand. I'll finish my pizza," she said, walking back to her table. "Do you want some of me?"</p> <p>"What do you think? Maybe we'll go to the movies, or something."</p> <p>"Oh, yes. Let's go. That's a good idea. I'm having some of that fun too," she said, waving off his offer. She pulled him to her, then bent over to kiss him. "Thank you," she said as she gave him a quick peck. "You're welcome," she said, giving him a good bye kiss on the cheek before returning to her table.</p> <p>He followed her to the cash register, paid for his pizza, and then watched her walk through the front door as she opened it. He was amazed how much was coming, and how she looked. The pizza, it seemed, was a lot. It was the closest he would ever get to food. The money was more than he would have had for a first date, which was his best bet. She was a stunner, with a fantastic body. He felt his excitement mount even though she wasn't aware of it.</p> <p>Finally, he started walking towards her, and his heart started to pound. He knew he shouldn't have done the first date, but to have her so close was like a knife in his heart. He didn't know how to keep control of himself, or whether he should feel good about it, but every time he looked towardsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
