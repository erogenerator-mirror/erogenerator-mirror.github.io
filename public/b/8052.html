"I'm sorry about what just happened last night. I didn't mean to hurt you, or make you feel uncomfortable."</p> <p>His arms came back around her neck and he leaned down to kiss her on the lips. "You didn't hurt me."</p> <p>She leaned back and smiled. "No, it was definitely different."</p> <p>"What happened? Where did you get that idea from?" he asked and looked around.</p> <p>"I really don't remember exactly," she said and kissed his cheek. "But that's all I'll show you," she said and got up to go up the stairs.</p> <p>"I'll tell you about that." he said and he followed Serena up the stairs.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Serena was in her room getting dressed before she heard the knock on the door. She had been wearing a dark blue shirt and dark blue pants, and her hair was pulled back and was tied up in a pony tail. She didn't take them off, because they were comfortable to stay in.</p> <p>She opened the door and there he stood, looking at him.</p> <p>"You're gorgeous. I couldn't stop staring at them," Serena said and closed the door. "I didn't do anything, but I hope I'd have a chance to look at you all day," Serena said.</p> <p>The way he looked at her made Serena's stomach flip through the air. He seemed to be lost in his world of lust, and she kept running her hand over his chest. She wasn't sure how to react to him being so turned on by her, but she felt her knees go weak. He hadn't even been staring at her chest yet, and she was already thinking, "I don't remember if I was wearing the bra or not, so I'm not sure I had them on, either."</p> <p>She walked over to him and he leaned down to kiss the side of her face. She felt her mouth water over and there was a warmth seeping through their lips. He pulled back and Serena started to turn around and kiss him more passionately, wrapping her arms around his neck. She knew he wanted to make it last as she had already wrapped herself up against him. She felt hands on her body and a breath on her cheek. Her arms went around his neck and she pressed closer.</p> <p>"I'm so excited to go out tonight," Serena said.</p> <p>"Me too," Chris said and kissed her neck. "My plan was to make tonight all about you, baby."</p> <p>That did it, and her entire body felt alive. She loved how his hands were on her body almost as much as he did hers. They were moving all over her body and she could feel all the tension left in her body. Her body and soul wanted so much so much. She pushed him away and stood up pulling him with her.</p> <p>"Let's go back downstairs," Chris said as he kissed her hand.</p> <p>Her heart was racing and she could feel herself getting excited again. She could feel his cock getting hard against her body and he felt it throb. She reached back and grabbed his cock and started to stroke it and slowly led him to the stairs. They both climbed back up and went back downstairs to find Serena watching TV.</p> <p>Chris sat down next to Serena watching the football game and Serena was talking to him. He leaned into her and kissed his wife.</p> <p>"How did it go?" Serena asked, but not talking.</p> <p>"I'm sure he'll be asking you one of his many questions tonight." Serena said and leaned in and kissed him.</p> <p>"We'll see," Serena said and gave her husband a quick hug.</p> <p>Chris sat down and was ready to say something when Serena and Serena walked over to him.</p> <p>"My baby," Serena said.</p> <p>'Hmmm... I guess I can ask him again," Chris said.</p> <p>"I'd like that." Serena said and kissed him. "Thank you,"</p> <p>Serena pulled away. "Let me know if you want to go back, okay?"</p> <p>"Let's go ahead. I'll make us coffee," Serena said, still kissing Chris.</p> <p>Serena turned on an old television which only came to a low setting. Their lips left a soft, wet sound as they kissed one another. Serena's hand ran over Chris's stomach on the way up.</p> <p>"I think I'm ready to try something," Serena said when Serena's hand reached the top of his pants.</p> <p>Chris moved his mouth from Serena's to kiss her cheek. Serena broke the kiss to smile and sit on Chris's lap.</p> <p>"It's okay. I love you, baby."</p> <p>"I love you, tooâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
