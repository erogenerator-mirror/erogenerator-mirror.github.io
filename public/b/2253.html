He whispered. "You see, I really don't have time to do other things that, well, just, ummm, do now. Like, you know... make money. Do stuff like that. And you don't get to do that until two or three AM, I think he needs to at least run a bath but it's a little late now." He smiled as he looked at her. "And then you have to have a car and money if you need to get it fixed up. Now come on, let's get started and I'll see how things go." He pulled her along and closed the door, then ran across the floor and up the stairs to the bathroom.</p> <p>The door was open and he turned the shower on, and quickly wrapped the small bar around his waist and adjusted the temperature until the water flowed over his body. He stepped under the stream and his body tingled slightly as he stood there looking at his reflection in the mirror. His suit was still stretched tight across his chest and he felt the heat of his body from the water and the coolness of the soap. He turned on another cold shower, this one hotter than the one last night, and turned his hair shampoo into a rich jet-haired lather. Then he took his bathtubs into the living area and rinsed them and started the water.</p> <p>He slipped his trunks off, then his shirt, then his jeans, before stepping out of the tub. He dried his hair off with a soft towel and then began to work on himself. For the first time he realized that the room was actually quite warm but not very warm either. As he massaged his chest and let his hand slip down to his balls he wondered if he might be sweating. No man had ever gone quite this far before in his life.</p> <p>As he let his hand slide down to his groin, he felt his pulse jump and heard it rise in response. He began to imagine how it must be to masturbate in front of a complete stranger and felt his cock harden as he imagined what it must feel like. He didn't think it much different from when he masturbated in the shower of friends or in his own apartment when his friends had invited him over to hang out. It had never actually happened, and to admit it he was surprised that one of his classmates had done so with just one person. But it was something that even in his fantasies it felt very wrong.</p> <p>He took the bottle of soap and stepped underneath the flow. Closing his eyes and thinking about the hot shower his fingers touched until his hand was covered by the softness of the soap. After several minutes of sliding his slippery digits under his balls and back up inside his shaft, a new thought suddenly popped into his mind. Why don't you play with yourself? As a man he'd been masturbating for hours but had never used his own body since he had masturbated himself down there one night after drinking whiskey all night long. But now with this stranger's soft touch, his own arousal, and his own fingers in his own hands he could not contain himself. He reached over with his other hand and began to run his finger very slowly up the length of his cock. He imagined it was her hands again, not his own, who were running through his hair and down his back.</p> <p>Suddenly he felt his hands on his hips, but couldn't feel where they were going. He tried to open his eyes to see again but he could only see their reflection in the mirror. The warm water felt wonderful on the smoothness that made up his back. His own hands were on his cock again as he began to rub his thumb around the sensitive spot that had grown inside him. His penis jumped as the pressure on his fingertip increased. As his thumb gently slid over the sensitive spot he felt like he could come just by reaching it. His other hand began to slowly stroke his shaft in time with the waves of pleasure that coursed through his body. Slowly he increased the pressure until the softness of his knuckles made him look over to his left side. He saw her staring back at him from the other side of a mirror so he increased the pace until he could feel the tension in the air between the two of them and he knew then he was in for a wonderful time. His breath came in ragged gasps as he stroked himself to the edge of the tub, then held back and let his fingers slide to the back of his hand and back down again. He held it still like that while his cock throbbed in time to his movements, his hand sliding down his shaft with every wave of pleasure that swept through him.</p> <p>Suddenly his fingers were being pushed up inside deeper and he realized that he too wanted to come. He knew his mouth was open from his own breathing but he was too far gone to stop himself. Suddenly he reached the point of noâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
