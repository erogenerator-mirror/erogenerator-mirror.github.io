I noticed that she looked tired.</p> <p>"Good evening, Jim," Gloria asked. "I heard that you might be having a fit. Do you have the doctor's appointment with you soon?"</p> <p>There was no answer from Jim or Gloria. Jim said that his doctor had called and that he had gotten the doctor's appointment.</p> <p>"Okay," Gloria said. "Well, it's the doctor's appointment to take her up and see the doctor. Why don't you go ahead and go over and tell him to come in."</p> <p>Jim and I went into the office. I knew Jim would be happy to see it anyway. I went ahead and told him to come sit down, then went to get more beer. There they both sat.</p> <p>The doctor looked at me and then looked at Jim. He said, "My name is Doctor Pumper, and I am a doctor of physical therapy here at the university campus."</p> <p>I explained the physical therapy part of the medical exam. But, I did not mention any sexual activity. I said, "My names is Gloria. I am sure you have heard of me, but I am not familiar with your name."</p> <p>Gloria smiled and said, "Yes. I know you are here to help with this physical exam. Please come in. I understand that you cannot just jump into the room and tell me that you're not really interested in being a doctor; you have to have a medical certificate. We need a certificate for you.</p> <p>I knew that Jim and I had always been a frequent visitor to the university. It seemed to me that the professors were too.</p> <p>Gloria looked at Jim and again said, "I do not know, Jim. I have looked at a lot of medical exams over the last couple of years. I only know that there has never been anything physical that is not clinical. But, I am sure you don't think I'm qualified to help with this. The doctor is coming and is going to examine you. When you have the medical certificate from me that is, I cannot just put it in a box in the front foyer, when this doctor comes in."</p> <p>I smiled and told him that even though he might be just a few hours away. He smiled and stood up. He took the certificate and we left. The doctor came in and told us that we were going to see him.</p> <p>Gloria was standing with Jim. The doctor introduced us and said that this was his appointment with an appointment from an out of town medical college doctor.</p> <p>Gloria said, "My office is on the top floor of my building. I told him that he might want to get in touch with you and that we would call you if he needed anything."</p> <p>The doctor gave her our personal appointment information and told her that she could contact you on her cell phone at that time.</p> <p>I took the doctor's call and she said, "Mr. Pumper, I am so sorry to be the center of attention. I am so sorry to be the face that this young man was staring at. He has always been a handsome man. I cannot let him do anything to you that he already knows how to do. Please forgive me."</p> <p>Jim and I were still sitting down. I looked around and said to Jim, "She said that I would tell her that I want to use my card since she was the one looking at me. I told her I was just in the office for a little while. I couldn't get the doctor to come in."</p> <p>Gloria took out her card and gave me my own name and showed me in. Then she showed me her doctor's appointment information and gave me her doctor's email address. I thanked her for her help and continued to sit on the couch.</p> <p>As I sat there I turned to Jim and said. "Gloria told me that I might never have a chance to actually talk to her. I told her that I hoped that I didn't have to rush her. I don't know what made me do it and then go and talk to her about a personal matter so fast. I know I shouldn't have done it. She told me that she would be very upset if I didn't do it. Jim, I just wanted you to know that, for me to really see this happening, it is wrong. I never meant to do anything like that. I have made love with a total stranger. I didn't know that I could love somebody as much as I do and that the feelings I have for her are just a part of my relationship with her. As I told you once, she was just a doctor. That is all."</p> <p>Before I could stop my self, I said, "Gloria did me a tremendous injustice by saying something like that. I am sorry for that."</p> <p>Gâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
