"It's late, and I'm pretty drunk."</p> <p>"No, no," I said, and walked off. That didn't help him get up. Instead of staying up, he sat down on the sofa and began to cry.</p> <p>I didn't know what to say.</p> <p>"I don't want you to be sorry," I said at first.</p> <p>"I won't. I'm a grown man, and I know what I'm talking about. I think that, whatever you did with the way it was, you were very foolish and a terrible person. I...I don't know what to say, Mom."</p> <p>"What?" I said, sitting down beside him. "I'm not a girl anymore. I'm your daughter. This has never happened to you."</p> <p>"No Mom, neither has it happened to me," he said, pulling his hand from my blouse. "I just... I'm sorry, now. And you shouldn't be sorry either, by taking you home. I wasn't stupid. I know."</p> <p>"Yes," I said. "I don't blame you."</p> <p>He nodded, still kneeling over on the couch. "When we left, we really loved this place and we've never been apart or together again. You're my life. But we should not have done anything together."</p> <p>"What about dad?"</p> <p>"Yes, I'm not going to do that with him. You're my dad, and he's my mother. And we both got stupid. Can't ever forgive each other."</p> <p>"That's not what I meant," he said. "I didn't mean for it to happen."</p> <p>I stood there with my back to him. "You're right. What is the harm if I...you know," I said shyly.</p> <p>"No, it isn't the harm. Maybe it is the worst thing you could have done."</p> <p>I laughed. "Okay, honey," I said. "Whatever it is, I don't think it is a good idea for me or your dad to get involved with anyone else, not even you."</p> <p>"Well, I guess if that were the case," he said, looking down. "I've heard stories about you and Dad, but I'm not going to have an affair with any one else."</p> <p>"I don't want kids," I said. "I just don't want to have any kids. Please."</p> <p>"No, no. This will be between you and me," he said with a sad look.</p> <p>"Then let me get some ice for both of us," I said. His face fell. He turned to leave. "Wait," I said, and held out my hand. He was already standing. "Let's go, then."</p> <p>"But Mom," he said. "I can't go home right now."</p> <p>"Go home right now, baby. I don't want you home right here. It might be a while before you're able to get some sleep."</p> <p>"I hate to ask, but will you give me a chance to walk?" he said.</p> <p>"It'll be okay," I assured him. "But I'm not ready to let you go just yet." He was still staring up at me, his big blue eyes bright shining in the soft light.</p> <p>"You think I'm okay for asking?" he said. "I just don't feel right saying it." He looked down a little bit. "Look, if dad could talk to you and..." He didn't say anything to me, but I could tell he was getting a little upset. "Would you be okay with it, if I agreed to be your lover and your lover?"</p> <p>"Are you asking me to be your lover and your girlfriend?" he said.</p> <p>I looked down a little bit. "I guess I should have expected it, now."</p> <p>"That's how it used to be," he said with a smile. I turned my head to look him in the eyes, and saw how happy he was at what I was saying.</p> <p>"I'm kidding, right?" I asked. "You're the only one I know," I said. His eyes opened, and he looked away. "No," I said. "That's not true." I leaned down to give him a hug, and he smiled back at me. "We can do it," I said. "I'm not asking you to have sex with people you'll be watching tomorrow, or in college. We'll just be friends." He smiled. "That's a nice idea. I guess we should be seeing Momâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
