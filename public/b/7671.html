She was a senior, right down to the last question, and a pretty, innocent looking girl. My first experience with a girl was the high school senior who I'd seen at a dance. Our relationship had been very open, and I still found her sexy. She was on the cheerleading team, and we got to hang out quite a few times with a couple of boys who were on track in college: one of which was a real hunk named Josh, and another, Josh's older brother, was one of the guys from school. We fucked each other's brains out when we went to my dad's wedding - and I'm still grateful for that. I hadn't seen her since the start of my freshman year, but I'd heard stories, heard jokes, the occasional, ever-present smile.</p> <p>My dad was on the staff at his office, but in a little over a year or so, he'd grown out of that, and my dad was moving on, to work in a smaller office in a small town. So, she had stayed in, and we talked, often, sometimes, sometimes the night was spent with her and one of the boys; sometimes in different rooms, sometimes just out; sometimes during a weekend, and I'd heard her making her way home from another.</p> <p>She was tall, slender and lean. Her shoulders were wide and her ass was slender, firm and tight. She always wore short skirts, and usually wore short sleeved shirts that showed off her nipples, just a hint. Her legs were long and shapely, with just enough lift to let you know she was shapely and shapely, so that she always looked good enough to eat. She and I had a good thing going.</p> <p>Even so, as with the rest of the freshman year, she made a point of flaunting herself in the halls and the classrooms. She wore black slacks and had on a yellow bikini top, which showed off her midriff and her small breasts nicely. She also came to classes in black stockings and a black thong that showed off her ass. She'd always said she had "dirty, slutty underwear," but I think she meant a lot more than just that. She'd been a virgin when she started high, but she still wore her own undergarments - sometimes worn tight, and sometimes with a bra to restrain her "tits." She didn't dress like she often did, which made her a lot more of an all-around slut, but it still seemed like she would dress to show off her body; like she wanted me to see.</p> <p>As our relationship, with its newfound openness, grew, one of the rules I was never to discuss with her during sexual encounters was "Not with friends, boyfriend or girlfriend." I knew that she would be able to resist, but she was just too shy about it. If she tried to go out with another girl, I had to ask her to meet someone I was dating - for a while - and if she didn't, I had to try to get rid of that first fling, or she could be the one to break it off. I felt bad about it, and it broke our relationship entirely. A big part of that was being a little wild, and there were lots of reasons why I couldn't, and it must have been my own way of making herself feel good. Like I said, not everyone is totally comfortable with themselves. It was my own way of feeling sexy because of it.</p> <p>I have to be honest, and I guess a lot of the rest of her history with me has shown me I don't need to see myself as the guy-slut-woman of a few girls - at least, that's what the stories said - and there was always a few times when we ended up having sex at least "right in front of a mirror," as someone would tell me. Some of the other girls were kind of different, as I've heard. Some were sexy and some weren't, and that was good enough for me, because I felt like I was sexy. But for most of the time I was also the most self-conscious person in the dorm, because I could always get a hard-on if I walked too long into the room.</p> <p>A few days ago, I got an email from her. She said it was very difficult to talk to her, even if she was in her last semester at High School. She was going to be out of town that week, and she had arranged to go out with some of her friends from school this weekend. She'd be at a dinner with some of them that she had made on her own, and we were going to go to an old friend's birthday party at a strip club down the block, and she was going to dress up likeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
