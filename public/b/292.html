We can all eat on the way' said James, as the three men went into the house.</p> <p>There was a little conversation in the kitchen before James, Laura and Beth arrived. James handed each of them a bottle of wine. Laura said that she and James didn't drink too much. Laura and Beth drank a few bottles of wine before finding some cheese and crackers. The three men sat around the table watching the game. At eight people sat down and started to chat. James had brought Laura the wine as well as wine. After about 10 minutes, James suggested that the games were over.</p> <p>James stood up and said, 'OK, time for a big game of doubles.'</p> <p>The players went off to their rooms and the men changed into shorts and T-shirts. As they arrived back in the room, Laura and Beth were surprised to see that the men were sitting opposite each other. Laura knew Beth was going to be on top but that she couldn't see anything. When they entered the room, both women gasped as they saw their husbands sitting on the couch in their clothes. James said, 'You haven't seen our husbands naked yet, have you?'</p> <p>Laura said, 'Umm not that I recall. I am kind of dressed in my swim suit.'</p> <p>Laura was now feeling really embarrassed as she got dressed.</p> <p>Beth went to James' bedroom and closed the door. Laura looked at the door from its handle and then walked towards the door. Laura looked into the bathroom to try and see what she could see and what she wasn't able to see. Laura was looking at a clear stream between her legs when she heard Sarah and Lisa getting into the shower. Sarah said, "I'm sorry about watching you and James."</p> <p>Beth said, "No problem, I'm okay. We just needed to cool off."</p> <p>They sat around the bar and the three men started drinking. Laura poured a couple of glasses of wine and sat down by the group of men. Once the wine was poured, Sarah was in the hot tub and Beth poured herself a glass. Laura sat down next to James and Laura sat in his lap. Beth and Sarah finished both glasses of wine as they watched the TV.</p> <p>After Laura and Sarah left the room, they talked a little more about the bet. Then Sarah said, 'We can stop right with the wine if we want to continue playing again. What would you like to do?'</p> <p>Laura said, 'Well, why don't we go into our room and get our bathing suits on? We can get dressed and head out together. This way, we won't be seen."</p> <p>Beth nodded her head, "Ok."</p> <p>The men made up the bed and Laura helped Sarah into her bathing suit and then went into their room. Sarah and Beth were sitting on the other side of James and on the edge of the bed.</p> <p>"I don't know about you or James, but I really want to see what you two would be doing." Then said, "Come on, come on, let's get out of here." They both jumped up and started off. They got out of the bedroom and walked towards the door without looking back at each other. When they got to the door. Sarah opened it and looked into the hallway. Beth and Laura walked down the hall together.</p> <p>"What are you two doing in here?" Sarah was yelling. Then said, "I thought you were up to staying up all night."</p> <p>Beth turned to face her friend and said, "I'm sorry that I'm late, but I'm sure you can tell by the way we are standing that we are going through our selves." Then she quickly added, "I know you and James got here early, but what are you going to do?" She then said, "Come with me."</p> <p>They both followed her into the bathroom where there was a king sized stone bathtub. They all got into the tub together.</p> <p>Sarah asked, "What are we going to do, just sit and watch TV on the other side of the tub?"</p> <p>Beth answered, "That can be fun!"</p> <p>Laura said, "We don't know if you can make us do anything. That was too fun for us. Come on, let's relax a bit. I'll go get another wine and set it in front of you." The men followed with Laura and Beth in front of James. Laura, Beth and Laura got out of the tub and both got on their knees next to the large tub. Beth looked at Sarah over her shoulder, then whispered, "Do you think you can take care of me?"</p> <p>Sarah saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
