Did I ever stop believing in God?" I said, incredulous that I would be the one to go to church with Paul when I started to think I would never go to church with my family again. I had a new outlook on life, a new philosophy on social change, a new outlook on life itself.</p> <p>"No," I said.</p> <p>"No I don't mean no, I mean no, you've been my friend for so long. Please don't do this. Please don't do it. Just look at me! Look at my heart. I will not forgive you if you go, just look at my heart. Maybe we wouldn't have come here if it hadn't been our own doing."</p> <p>There was another long pause then, not so much from the sound of it, but from the sound of my own heart. "I know, but I didn't want to make some kind of commitment. It's just a really big step. I know, I've known for a long time I thought things had changed. I guess I got the impression that Paul seemed to be saying everything was ok. Then I realized that when I did and said whatever he said I just had to say the words that were meant to be, or they would just go. If you didn't want me to go then I didn't think I could do it. I didn't want to change anything with him, anything with this God of mine, but I did. I don't know if you know exactly how bad I am, but I'd think that I could live to see what life is like at one time, not like it is now."</p> <p>"What made you think about it?"</p> <p>"I didn't think it was really important. I thought it might just be an excuse to change things around. It's never even been thought about. It was just something that I was waiting for. You know Paul, I'm glad for that. If anyone gets hurt then I'm ready to end it."</p> <p>"What would it have been like to lose him? I know I'd want that to happen but...you know?" I was already taking this in. "How do you talk about losing a friend like that, I love you. But the best thing that could have happened would have been to forgive each other."</p> <p>I could have argued with him, but I didn't. I realized that it was more than Paul. He loved me. I realized that he loved me, in some ways, more than I did. His love for me seemed like an anchor in my life, like Paul did. Paul seemed to be that same way. It was all true, I realized. I told myself that Paul was the one, the God, and I loved him just for himself. I really liked Paul.</p> <p>We looked at each other's hands, and the tears rolled down my cheeks as we took each others' hands in a soft caressing embrace and began to kiss. I felt Paul's hand moving down my body as I felt my own. He stroked my body softly and his touch was feathery, gentle and comforting. I kissed him back with increasing fervor. He moved his kisses down my neck to my chest and he teased my nipples until they stood to attention, causing me to moan and writhe a little when he finally took one of them into his mouth.</p> <p>"Oh, God, Paul, I love you so much," I cried as he kissed and suckled both of my nipples until they got so hard it hurt. I felt them begin to swell as the blood rushed back into them. He knew what that meant.</p> <p>Paul pushed me down and I fell against the headboard as he kissed his way down my belly. He stopped at my navel and I felt the sharp sensation as he drew away from me. His fingers traced the outline of my tummy as he traced its contours and he pressed his lips to mine as he began to kiss around my navel. His kisses were so hot and sexy and wet and I began to writhe against him. He kissed me lower, past my belly button, and he kissed my sex. I gasped when he slid his hands beneath my skirt and caressed my legs and then my inner thighs, pushing them outward.</p> <p>As he moved to take my pussy in his mouth and taste me for the very first time I felt his tongue dart into me and licks my swollen sex lips and then slide down my slippery, wet pussy. He kissed my lips and his tongue slipped back up to find my clit which he immediately sucked and nibbled on. I felt as though I could cum the moment he licked my clit. It felt almost as though I would have come on his tongue, his lips, his lips.</p> <p>I couldn't believe that I had been so completely honest with myself, for the firstâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
