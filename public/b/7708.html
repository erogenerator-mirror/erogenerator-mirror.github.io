She laughed again.</p> <p>I looked over at her as she played with her nipple and, in the way that John said he could feel the sensation of her fingers on it. The look on her face as she played with herself told me she was pleased. I told her that she would be surprised by my reaction and said that she ought to let him do as he wants and then get up and walk over to him; not too fast, not too quick, just right to let him have his way while I watched.</p> <p>"Do you want to see a man in his early 20's? I'd like to watch if that's okay with you." She didn't say it in a tone of voice that she'd used before to play it from a man's perspective. She was giving him what he'd been longing for.</p> <p>"Yes darling, this will be just perfect." The look in his eyes told her all that she wanted to hear.</p> <p>As soon as she sat in his lap and his erection was now pressed up hard against her, I took her arms off me and she reached down and grasped it and began tugging it. He lifted his head to kiss her and the expression on his face was priceless. As he pushed it down inside her she opened her legs to make room for it. He looked up and said that he wanted to do that too, but she wasn't going to let him. He had two choices. He could have fucked her and still have the strength of a man or he could come back to her and fuck her all day long. It was up to him to decide. He picked his cock up and, while he stood up to make room for her, pushed it up inside her and held it there, moving it around in the warm, wet, embrace of her cunt. She let out a soft moan and pulled him down to her.</p> <p>They spent the morning kissing and fondling each other's bodies, touching and caressing each other's most intimate places. It was a slow, sensuous fucking. I heard him talk a couple of times about her nipples and her clitoris. When he reached to the other side she just stopped him. He moved his face away and took the side of it in his own mouth and pulled on it with his teeth and fingers causing her to let out a shriek of delight. He had her in such a sexual state during the weekend that she just had to have a very serious orgasm.</p> <p>When it happened I had to close my eyes but just watched them. I knew that they were really enjoying themselves and that she was having such a powerful feeling of satisfaction. She didn't say a word but just smiled, leaned over and kissed him, as she held him with one of her hands and caressed his erection with the other. He just gave her a light smile and said that he couldn't believe he had just been called, "the luckiest man on the planet" and I couldn't believe that she had actually given him a full description of what he'd been doing to her. She said that his face was priceless. She had said her favorite phrase in the best way. "I wish I could tell a little about my new boyfriend!"</p> <p>I'm not sure if it was the surprise of knowing that he could have made a difference or of her having thought that way while she was having such feelings but I was able to see that her arousal had a very clear memory. It was like hearing a small part of the old "Let's Fuck!", a little phrase that had seemed odd at the time. She just seemed to be relishing it.</p> <p>"What's my 'little boyfriend' look like?"</p> <p>"No, he's really good."</p> <p>"Really? Well he's got a very nice dick."</p> <p>"What would he do to the both of us if he gave me my wish?"</p> <p>"Oh, we'd certainly know."</p> <p>"Just to be on our best behavior and you were really in her debt for that?"</p> <p>"Not just because you were giving me such pleasures but also because of what I was feeling."</p> <p>"What's that supposed to mean?"</p> <p>"It means that you would like us to have an extra one if we're together."</p> <p>"Yes, that's right and then what?"</p> <p>"And what's 'extra'?"</p> <p>"What are you looking for?"</p> <p>"You know, lovemaking. You'd be happy to just lay here and let me pleasure youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
