Both of them were a bit ashamed of their behaviour but both were equally horny and, after years of aching pussies, no less, ready. It was obvious the men's sexual appetite had been increasing over the last few days, and both had been enjoying each other's company.</p> <p>His cock was already fully erect and he was ready to give his partner something she'd never received. He had already put a condom on the end of his now eight inch cock and pulled the condom on. He slid behind her and gently pushed against her, the sensation and the anticipation were so good both of them groaned, their faces turning up to each other's eyes as the two of them parted. Then, when the time was right to enter, he pushed forward and filled his lover well. Her pussy was warm and wet and he immediately felt himself beginning to harden.</p> <p>"Christ, I can't wait any more," he groaned as he moved to withdraw a bit.</p> <p>"It'll be a while," she said, the two of them turned to look at their partners, their mouths dropped open, tongues dancing with their own saliva. His cock still rigid, he pushed forward some more and suddenly felt it slide past her cervix and into her womb. Her soft skin felt heavenly wrapped around him as he moved, and the feeling sent a shiver through every nerve of his body, he started to gently thrust, making her moan. With that his pace slowed, both men feeling they'd soon be free.</p> <p>"Christ, I wish I could do that," she murmured, her breathing heavy, "but, wait until I get back home tonight?"</p> <p>"Well, I've got a spare key in my pocket," said Jack, who was now just about as naked as her and, with that, had to go and put his trousers back on.</p> <p>Both moved to their respective doors and opened them, they looked back, both smiling and a look of anticipation on their faces. This time, there was no mistaking their desire. Neither could look away. The both stood in the foyer, hands behind their back. Their excitement was obvious and Jack pushed the door open and slipped into the hallway. For a moment they just stood there, smiling at each other - the excitement of the moment was growing as it played itself out, they both felt it in their bodies as if they were building to the height of it. Then, without even a thought they were in each others arms, their mouths locked on each others, their hands exploring every inch of each other as their passions ramped up.</p> <p>They both opened the door, stepped back and smiled at each other. "We had a little fun with you," said Beth, who was walking by and had been listening.</p> <p>"Yes, it did", said Jack, turning and kissing her, his hands on her bottom, pulling at the cheeks, giving them a playful squeeze.</p> <p>"Yes, we did!" said Beth. They walked out towards the bedroom, their hands wandering freely over each others bodies and their minds awhirl. They stopped with Jack holding her as they walked down towards her, his cock rock hard in his pants and his mouth on hers.</p> <p>Beth pushed him away and got down on her knees. She took his cock into her mouth, savouring every inch and then, after a moment, she took the end in as far as she could. Beth then sat on the edge of the bed, reached behind and took Jack's balls in her hands, massaging them gently.</p> <p>"Do I need to explain this to you later?" she asked, pulling back from him and looking directly at him, her smile broadening.</p> <p>"No really, Beth, it feels wonderful," was his reply.</p> <p>Beth, who had never seen Jack like this before, slid the hem of her skirt all the way up and, turning away, peeled her panties down around her ankles and stepped out of them. She was totally naked before him. Jack turned to face her and they kissed again, their lips pressing together as their tongues touched each others. As they kissed, Jack felt Beth begin to remove his clothes, which he dropped onto the floor. His hands roamed up her body, massaging her breasts and then moving to her buttocks. His fingers found her anus and he slid his middle finger inside her, searching for the spot that she so love. He knew she felt pleasure when she knew when she experienced ecstasy when he took pleasure in her, for, at that moment, without thinking, in an instant, her legs had parted and Jack was inside her again.
