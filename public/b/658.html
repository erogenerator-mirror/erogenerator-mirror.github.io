"And of course, you know what your father is." She winked, a light that showed on her lips. "I hope you still love him."</p> <p>I pulled the covers up over my knees and we snuggled side by side. I pulled her in closer to me, resting my cheek on her shoulder.</p> <p>"You're so lovely and so incredibly desirable," I whispered.</p> <p>"I know," she replied, her voice still soft and sweet. "I want to be loved."</p> <p>I squeezed her gently. "Then I suppose it behooves me to come out from behind and be with you."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"I'm afraid I'll hurt you."</p> <p>"Please don't. Don't."</p> <p>I squeezed her. "You feel very safe with me."</p> <p>"I know. You're too." She looked at me, questioningly. Then she kissed the tip of my nose. "You're such a good Daddy."</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>I had planned to return to the dormitory, but my parents informed me that I needed to get back to the house, since I was going to visit my aunt and uncle on Sunday. My parents were happy to see me, so they didn't get me to go with them.</p> <p>I packed my luggage, my makeup case, and my cell phone.</p> <p>I checked in to my room, turned on the bedside lamp, and lay back on my bed. The phone was quiet, but I knew that I could hear my aunt's voice from the other end of the phone so I just pressed the call button.</p> <p>"Are you there?" she asked. The voice was familiar and sexy...no, sexy, but not bad.</p> <p>"Yes," I breathed out.</p> <p>"Hello," she said. "I can't believe how much fun we had tonight."</p> <p>"I know," I said. "You're in better spirits and better mood."</p> <p>"I'm very happy with that," she said. "So what are you going to do with yourself on Sunday?"</p> <p>My heart started to race. "I'm going to visit a friend, I haven't told her much about you, I don't want everything to get out, so we'll just be able to talk until the end, okay?"</p> <p>"Okay!" she said. "Have you got anything to pack for Saturday? My mom's going to love that. I can't wait to be home!"</p> <p>"I'll be there. I'm on holiday with my Auntie Elaine..."</p> <p>"Don't tell her anything, okay?" I assured her.</p> <p>"It just might be too far, okay?" she said.</p> <p>"Do you have anything for me? I want you to spend the entire day with me, but we're both adults. I want to spend time with you, okay?"</p> <p>"Of course. You're a good girl."</p> <p>"You're really sweet, too?"</p> <p>I smiled, and told her that she looked very beautiful, really wonderful. "And so full of surprises," I whispered. "You should see the look in my eye."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"What look, sweetie?"</p> <p>"You know," she said. "What's that look I'm wearing?"</p> <p>I shrugged my shoulders. "I don't know. Are you sure you can tell?"</p> <p>She pulled back the pillow she had thrown at me and looked intently at me. "Yes, I do," she said. "I think I can tell. I'm very positive."</p> <p>I sat up, too and leaned over to face her. "You're sure, sweetie," I said. "This might not be good with your aunt."</p> <p>She smiled and turned to look at me again. "Would I...would I like to experience a whole evening of this?"</p> <p>"You'll," I said. "It'll be lovely." Then, to my surprise, she grabbed my hand and pulled me towards her room. She unlocked the door, flung open her big comfy two-story room, and led me to the queen-size bed. I felt the mattress creak and rustle under me, and I knew that she had taken the comfy sheets she was wearing. We lay there, my hand on her waistline for the most part, enjoying the closeness. I slid my hand further down to cup the bottom of one of her breasts.</p> <p>She was wearing a strapless bra, and I felt her nipple pebble under my palm.</p> <p>"Mmm," she moaned. "That feels nice."</p> <p>"It does. You feel so nice."</p> <p>"Maybe we shouldn't do this," she said.</p> <p>I pulled my hand away from her breastâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
