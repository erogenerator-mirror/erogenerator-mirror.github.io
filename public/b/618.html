I love having him in my life. I also love the way his hands feel all over me. I want to find out what his body feels when he touches me. I love the way he smells on my body when I go in the bathroom. The way his cum feels on my body when he enters me. Every time I am with my son, I am completely satisfied. Sometimes I love every minute of it, but lately, I have not gotten any sex out of him.</p> <p>In any case, I would like to share something about me with you. Your secret isn't out; it may or may not be, but it's your secret.</p> <p>If you still want me to find out what's in my secret to tell you, please vote on it. I love you,</p> <p>-A.J.~</p> <p>This story is my first submission. Thank you for reading it.</p> <p>-Paulâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
