I also had a plan of attack as a team. The most I expected, but what the wait for was not sure. If I were right, it was going to be hard; if not, what better way to fight a war than a fight in an ambush. If I was wrong, I would be sure to have it soon.</p> <p>We had only just arrived, a little over a five kilometer ride away, when I heard the door of a building in the distance open. If nothing else, I was not the easiest of men to sneak up behind. I turned, a look of concern on my face as she opened the door and ushered me inside.</p> <p>Now, I have no idea how she got my attention, but the second she closed the door, she had the desired effect. She was wearing the same outfit, although, to me, it was more of a costume change to her. It showed off her figure, accentuating her full breasts and flat stomach. The black bra showed even more of her ample cleavage and, to my pleasure, she was wearing a matching mini skirt. She had her long hair pulled back in a bun and she had a sheen over it so that it shined against her skin.</p> <p>"Hi," she said as though we were a couple of friends, "come on in. I don't want to keep you waiting too long. We'll be done in ten minutes."</p> <p>"Thanks," I said, "I'm still waiting."</p> <p>"I know that sweetie," she said taking my hands and leading me up a flight of stairs. There were two sets of double doors leading to the third floor. "You'll have to wait," she said softly, "that one is for the bedroom."</p> <p>Her bedroom was a larger one with a king sized bed in the corner. I was surprised that she was still taking me up on this offer. I followed her into her room, taking my time. She closed and locked the door behind me, leading me down to the edge of the bed. She was wearing a pair of black stockings and looked absolutely amazing from the back, as she was bent over to tie her shoe. She wore high heels and looked even better when she was standing and stretching. Her large breasts rose up and swayed side to side, a sight that had me in a perpetual state of erection.</p> <p>She turned around, "Sit down," she said as she stepped up to me, "I'll go and get the massage oil." She disappeared inside a door and I could hear her go to the cupboard. She returned in moments, sitting down on the edge of the bed. She had the oil, poured two generous scoops and put one at the foot of the bed. She was not only going to have to lie face down on the bed, but also sit on it, face upturned, arms up folded. She was ready; I was going to do it.</p> <p>I poured a generous amount into her palm and massaged her shoulder, neck and upper arms. As I started to move down to her lower arms, I could see she was already reaching for her right nipple. I stopped and leaned forward and took it between my lips, licking it gently. She moaned at first, then started pushing it against my tongue.</p> <p>Her breast was soft and warm, and I moved my hand to caress her soft mounds, tracing them before moving my way to the top. I ran my fingers down her chest, stopping momentarily at the top of her stockings. I kissed my way down her thigh, pausing only to run my tongue in feather light patterns around the edge of her panties, as I continued to tease her. I could smell the musky odor of her arousal mixed with the perfume of her body, and I just had to have a taste. I reached up with my fingers and slowly peeled the silky fabric from her body, exposing her breasts. I took them into my mouth one at a time, first one, and then the other, kissing and sucking on her perfect, pink nipples.</p> <p>Her body was warm and soft and her body had become incredibly sensual, making me hungry for her. I stood up and dropped my pants, revealing my already stiffening member. She leaned forward taking me between her full lips, as I watched my cock disappear between her lips. I leaned back and enjoyed the feel of her soft skin surrounding my member. I could not believe a woman could be this hot and willing to pleasure me, and I found myself enjoying it as much as she did.</p> <p>I had only had this one experience of this level of sexual pleasure, and I was getting to know more about the sensuality of every woman than I had even before. As I started to move my hips in a circleâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
