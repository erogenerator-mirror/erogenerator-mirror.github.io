I’ve been through a rough patch lately.”</p> <p>“Really?”</p> <p>“You know how it is.”</p> <p>“Well, I’ve been through what?”</p> <p>“Well,” she said smiling, “it involves the three of us. For example, I was involved with Jason’s father for a few months before I started seeing him and he left me. This time he was going to move to Canada and be with his son.”</p> <p>She sat beside me and ran her hand over my chest. “That makes sense. I thought he probably had a few friends left.”</p> <p>I leaned back smiling. “I’m sure he does.”</p> <p>She smiled as she touched me, looking at me intently. “The way he acts about sex seems like he enjoys it.”</p> <p>My hands reached out to her soft shoulder. “I’ve told you about the things that I’ve done with a woman in the past. You won’t ever think of asking me to do anything with anyone except Jason.”</p> <p>She shook her head. “I can’t do that to him.”</p> <p>She was still as I was. “It might be nice to think we were both doing it, but it doesn’t have to be.”</p> <p>“It’s just . . . I think you would look good in a bikini.”</p> <p>“Thanks.”—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
