He has his eyes closed while he enjoys the feeling, and she is very thankful that he was doing this to get her to feel pleasure like she has just had.</p> <p>"How does it feel?"</p> <p>"It's kind of hard to describe, I guess from the start."</p> <p>"You could say that, it's pretty thick and long and wide and..." he places his fingers on the side of her neck for emphasis.</p> <p>"Niiiice," she says as she feels him slide in to the base of his cock. He then slides one of her fingers up her throat, and she feels it slide up to the base of his cock to where it meets his body, and she feels it slide down to the base of hers as she feels him push in to meet her fingertip.</p> <p>"Your finger just goes in..." She then feels his entire cock slide up into her mouth, and she feels it slide around her tongue and she tries not to let out the moan that seems to have come out on every breath. He takes her mouth in his and forces her to swallow the last of her juice of that last orgasm he had.</p> <p>Then, he puts his hand back at her neck, forcing her face back towards him so she feels his finger at her throat, and pushes it down to the front of her throat, forcing her to hold his finger there in place.</p> <p>"I think, this is probably the worst part of the procedure, because I can't really get my tongue in to go in, and then you have to move it a little..." he says as he looks into her eyes, which are now wide and looking up at him with fear. Even though she thinks he was telling her that to try to avoid her gag reflex, he knows there is something else going on, something that would help him take her to the edge. He takes a moment to let his mind take away the guilt of what had just happened, and then continues.</p> <p>"Look down, honey, see how your tongue is now going in to go in to go in..." and he slides his finger in and out of her throat, going slowly, making it take his time.</p> <p>"There," he says as he pulls the finger out of her mouth, and she closes her eyes again as she feels herself being sucked.</p> <p>"Look at her mouth, her nose, and your eyes, see how her tongue is going in and out, and you can feel your throat getting very tight..."</p> <p>"It's ok," and she opens her eyes and looks at his eyes as if it's all a dream.</p> <p>He then slides a second finger in to her throat, and she feels the back of his hand touch her skin, and almost instinctively, she opens her mouth to look at him. She can't help but gasp again as the tip of his fingers touch her throat, and she can feel the back of the fingers on the base of her throat and feel them push their way into it.</p> <p>"Go back in, honey..."</p> <p>He removes his fingers, and she begins to feel the pressure, and the pressure of his finger in her stomach again, while she looks at his eyes to see how it's going. He doesn't put it into a rhythm, and doesn't take it from her mouth as if it was his finger, and he just holds it there, as his thumb slides down the back of her tongue to get to the center of her tongue.</p> <p>"Oh, I just remembered," she says as she takes a deep breath, "I got you some ice-cream."</p> <p>She says it as she realizes that's what she has to get herself off.</p> <p>"You should try it before you give it up," he tells her before he places his finger at the entrance to her mouth.</p> <p>"No, I think I'm the only one," she says as she puts a hand over her mouth, "I want the taste, I want that mouth on me," she says as she opens her mouth and takes the ice-cream, which she has not tasted before.</p> <p>"Well, that's cool," he says, "how did you like it?"</p> <p>"I really enjoyed it...and it's not too bad, really, even the first bit will go in without really hurting, so don't feel weird about this," she tells him as she smilesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
