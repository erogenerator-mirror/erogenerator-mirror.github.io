No need for you to try your luck elsewhere until you get to your own boat."</p> <p>I smiled and replied, "Well, it is on a couple of days off so I probably won't, but I'll get to the island in plenty of time to see where it goes."</p> <p>"You will. That is a good thing."</p> <p>"A good thing? You aren't sure me. This island is a new world to me," I asked with a smile.</p> <p>"Just as long as you can come for a vacation when you get old enough," she said with a smile.</p> <p>"Oh yes, I want to." She paused a minute then added, "But only if you come with me."</p> <p>We hugged tightly and she whispered in my ear, "It will be my pleasure." Then she took off up the coast to her home in the big hills over the Big O to be with her family.</p> <p>The next several days passed well without a hitch. I was back on the island with my mother. We made camp out on shore as she prepared the next week's trip to the mainland. She was happy to see me and wanted to know more about our vacation.</p> <p>We stopped at the nearest town and spent a weekend at the beach. I was getting used to the sand, water, and wildlife out there. I was having a difficult time taking in the sights of the area but my mother was a very gracious and well-mannered lady and was very understanding until we were back at her home. Once we arrived, we spent a few hours at poolside so it was no problem to play with ourselves or use the pool.</p> <p>We spent the next few days catching up on old times. The water, beaches, sounds, and of course the occasional noise from the nearby cabin. We decided to head back to the town about 2:00 PM which gave us a chance to visit a town along the way. I had my eye on a shop where I had wanted to purchase something for a special day to start my cruise on with my cruise home on the other side of the country.</p> <p>"I bought this for you," I mentioned.</p> <p>"I love it when you show it to me," she said with a grin.</p> <p>"I'm going to keep it the next time," I told her as I sat there with a grin on my face.</p> <p>"No need to," she giggled.</p> <p>In spite of the nice weather and the good food, my mom really enjoyed my cooking so we decided to go to the local beach. We grabbed up some food, grabbed a couple of bottles of wine and began taking our fill. I did all the cooking while she put her stuff in the fridge. As we enjoyed dinner, we found a spot in a little water, found a cooler and began eating. After the meal, we had another glass of wine to relax and talk about whatever we had eaten all day. We relaxed back on the lounge chair and talked more about the trip. I was thinking about how I would like to come up to the island one day, as I was thinking about my cruise home to the old town. I could feel my cock start to get hard as my mind continued over the possibilities.</p> <p>Eventually we finished our wine and agreed to go to my room and do the same tomorrow afternoon. We took our time getting ready and did not rush to bed. In the morning, we got up and got ready to head off to my room on the island and the following day. I was beginning to think that we might find us a better time as a vacation than just one day.</p> <p>We packed up our bags and moved on down to my mom's old room. The place was small but very nice. I think we could easily find a nice place for a picnic or a movie, but I was not prepared to settle for just swimming and sunning on the beach. I was planning to take off early and get a rest by dinner when mom put her bikini on. It was the first time I had ever put on a top, especially one that wasn't very skimpy. I didn't want to take the risk but couldn't get my mind off what mom would look like.</p> <p>"Just a quick swim then get cleaned up and dressed," mom was saying as she headed towards the bathroom.</p> <p>When mom reached the toilet and began to take a shower herself, I was feeling very uncomfortable. I was feeling very self-conscious of my erection and knew that as soon as I sat down at my desk I would be sporting a boner to the point of discomfort as I sat there. I just sat there, staring at my erect cock. I didn't dare touch it so I thought I would stay there for as long as I could. As the bathroom was closing I decided to get up. It felt strange that just sitting here, unable toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
