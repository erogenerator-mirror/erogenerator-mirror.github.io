He picked it up off the phone and went to get it from his locker, and called a taxi to give it back to him.</p> <p>"Well we're going to head home," he said.</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm going back to my room, the first thing is to get out of these clothes," he added, pulling his sweatshirt on.</p> <p>"What happened next?" Josh asked, laughing, as he pulled his boots on. "Did you make out with some boy?"</p> <p>"No, not really. I did kiss him a bit, and after that I asked him to come back so we could have fun and I didn't feel like dancing when he did." Jake said. He went to walk off, knowing that it wasn't an accident.</p> <p>Samantha had noticed the tension between the boys and had to adjust her skirt a bit so that it didn't show more skin. She made it a point to give Samantha a little more time to dry herself, and was glad when the damp became sticky and sticky.</p> <p>They had arrived at the hotel by now, and checked in. Samantha was pleased to see that her outfit was quite flattering, and that Jake was well-dressed too.</p> <p>Jake had a light coat on that was hanging on the back of a chair, so he pulled it up and handed it to Sam.</p> <p>Once they got settled, they watched a couple of episodes of the show. It was a movie, and Sam loved that it was so close to the action so far.</p> <p>They decided to order a pizza, while waiting for their orders.</p> <p>"I have to pee first," Jake said, and Samantha smiled wickedly. They watched enough of that to make them think they were in a line for a pee-fest.</p> <p>"Oh well," Jake said. "I guess I'd better go, or they would have to go," he said, and then he turned and walked away, and Sam could hear the water trickling in the bathroom.</p> <p>Samantha pulled another tee shirt on, and went to the bathroom to give herself a clean. She sat on the toilet for a long a while, with her hand still resting between her thighs. She looked at her reflection in the mirror, and sighed. "I am so glad that I made out with you. I am so thankful that you made out with me," she said.</p> <p>"Yeah, I did make out with a few boys," Jake agreed.</p> <p>"Good!" she said. "But when was the last time I did it with you?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don't know," Jake said. "It seemed strange the way Jake was holding me at the door, but I was just in love, wasn't I?"</p> <p>"Yeah, you were," she said.</p> <p>"And your tongue felt like a big cock when you did it."</p> <p>"Well I was pretty wet when I did it."</p> <p>"I'll bet. That's good, huh?"</p> <p>"It was a bit strange, but it felt quite right," Jake said, grinning slightly.</p> <p>"You're making this up," said Samantha. "I'm all wet now! I wish I was like you!"</p> <p>"Do you feel that?"</p> <p>"Yeah! I can feel my panties getting even wetter. I think I may have just peed myself!" she said, giggling.</p> <p>"Mmmm, I think I have to go too," Jake said."</p> <p>"Goodnight, Jake. I'll see you at a better time than you thought," Sam said, and then she exited the bathroom.</p> <p>Jake, after watching the movie once again, stood up, looking at Sam's wet pussy.</p> <p>"What did you do?" he asked.</p> <p>"Wash my pussy," she said.</p> <p>Jake got up and walked over to her; he sat down on her thighs, and leaned in to start kissing her. Sam's leg moved up higher on his as they kissed.</p> <p>"I want you so much," said Jake.</p> <p>"Then we must do something," said Sam. "But first I want to be sure you don't peed yourself or anything."</p> <p>"I'll do that," Jake said, smiling. As he moved down her body and placed his lips over her left breast, Sam started to moan. As he kissed and sucked on her left breast, his right hand reached down to caress his cock through his pants.</p> <p>"That feels niceâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
