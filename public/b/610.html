What are you going to do to him? I'll just hang around if you want."</p> <p>"You are so sweet, I'll have to do something with him some other day, but not right now," Rob said.</p> <p>I laughed out loud at that suggestion. He smiled, then grabbed my arm and pulled me to sit just behind him. I sat on his lap, with my back to him. He looked at his wristwatch, "Yeah, here's how it works," he said. He wrapped his arms around my body and kissed me on the neck. I let him hold me as I ran my fingers through his chest hair, and his mouth tasted of cinnamon and cinnamon, then he said to me, "We need to get back to work. You're going to fuck Rob for that extra money he sent me, then it's your turn to fuck him in the ass." I giggled and said, "You've seen one of your old boys with a big cock up his ass?"</p> <p>Rob kissed me again, then said, "Not exactly, but you can tell him that. I don't think that's necessary, except for when it has to be your turn."</p> <p>"You want me to tell him?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes, but it's not going to be like you do it, it might be a problem."</p> <p>"I think it will be fine," I said as I slid a hand down his chest and around his cock. I squeezed it through his pants and smiled, thinking, "I sure hope that's what he's wearing now."</p> <p>Rob said, "So what's your problem this time?"</p> <p>"I'm not fucking a client today. We're getting a divorce," I said.</p> <p>"That's fucking awesome!" he said. I could see his hard cock in his pants, and I'd heard a lot about it, since I'd fucked him that day, and I knew I might be able to get it back. I wanted it back in my mouth if we were going to finish our relationship, and I wanted to see that his cock was nice to see again.</p> <p>I slid Rob's cock out from my mouth, kissed him long, and then whispered, "I want him so bad," in his ear through my teeth.</p> <p>"He'll suck your cock," he said.</p> <p>"I want his fucking mouth on mine right now," I said as I sat on his lap and kissed his lips. He looked up at me, and I kissed him again. Rob took my face and pulled me down to him, so that our mouths were locked together and his cock was in front of me, right there in front of him. I kissed him and he took my head in his hands, pulling me back to press his mouth against mine. It was a long, wet, kiss and he tasted like mint chocolate, and it made him feel wonderful. His tongue slid along my lips, then up to my mouth and into my mouth. I moaned into his mouth as our tongues began to explore each other's mouths.</p> <p>Rob broke the kiss long enough to say, "Let me lay you on your back." He laid the bed cover down, then stood up and unbuttoned his shirt as I lay on the bed. I stood back up to look at his bare chest and his strong, sexy arms and legs, then lay on top of him as Rob got the bed covers off the bed. I looked at him for a few seconds, still not believing what I was seeing. I had never really thought of myself as a Lesbian, but here I was, sitting there with cock in hand, with him kissing me with an intensity that I liked.</p> <p>Rob slid his arms under me, and up my back, and pulled me down on top of him. We were still kissing long enough to get the sheet off the mattress and onto the floor, then lay back down on top of it. We continued to kiss, then Rob slid down my body to take off my shirt, then my bra. My breasts were bare now, and his hands and mouth were everywhere on them. I began to fondle them then, first in my hand, then in my mouth, as his tongue licked and tickled my nipples. I was moaning and sighing in his mouth. He took my nipples in his fingers, which began to become stiff and erect. I arched my back and groaned in enjoyment. He slid my shirt over my head, and kissed his way down my stomach. I felt his tongue as it slithered down my body towards my hot wet pussy.
