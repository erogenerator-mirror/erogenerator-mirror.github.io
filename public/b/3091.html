We walked through the sliding glass doors, took each step with the soft, low, sweet music of a child's birthday and my garden. We walked through the gate as it closed, past the fountain, out of the kitchen and into my garden. I handed a twenty dollar bill to Mrs. Moore, who had not used her name. She smiled her radiant smile and said, as we stood there beside each other, "You're such a naughty boy. My husband only fucks me with his fingers." She giggled, "He is the best." I nodded my approval, "He loves me like this." We stepped across to where my wife was standing and embraced. I wrapped my arms tightly around her as I pulled her into my body and kissed her deeply, pushing my tongue deep into her mouth. I kissed down her neck until I reached her magnificent breasts, kissing the nubbin until it was rock hard, my tongue trailing down her cleavage until it ran against her areola. I took one of her nipples between my fingers and gently rubbed it. Mrs. Moore was moaning, "Oh, John, that feels so good." I pinched the other nipple as she squirmed.</p> <p>"You're right about John feeling really good. He's a sexy young man and you have him ready to be fucked, Mrs. Moore. I can't wait for him to fuck you properly." I bent down and began to kiss her breasts as my fingers teased her nipples. I looked up past her cleavage to see my wife standing just inside the door watching us.</p> <p>My wife came back into the room with a box of towels, towels, everything. "I didn't know you had towels in that house. Does John have the box?" She began undressing, leaving her robe on. "Yes, I did, Mrs. Moore. You have to use his in the shower in the morning." My wife's mouth was already on my dick as I watched her strip for me in the doorway. She knelt on the floor in front of me, the towel already laying on the floor in front of me. She lifted my already erect dick. "Is this nice?" "It's nice, actually. I like to feel the warmth inside me. It's been awhile since you have touched me like this."</p> <p>"You were a virgin?"</p> <p>"I was. That's all." she looked up at me with a naughty smile and blew me a kiss. "John had to wait a long time before he could have sex. I've been waiting for him for years and was scared he'd never cum inside me. When he finally did cum I nearly passed out with the pain. I still have it in me. His hands are magic."</p> <p>I shook my head as she began stroking my shaft up and down, coating my dick with her saliva. "We're so lucky. My husband could make a fortune in sex. Does your man have any other women you would like him to fuck?" I wondered what the hell there was to do in a fantasy fuck.</p> <p>"Well, I'm not sure if a hot young stud like John would ever be interested in having fun with married women. I don't even have a husband that goes around asking. But John would never leave me unsatisfied." she winked as she licked the head of my dick. "I don't suppose my husband has any luck with other women."</p> <p>"You are such a slut, but your husband. That was just a game. My husband would never take advantage of you. Your husband just wants you a lot, to feel your pussy, but doesn't really have anything like that for women. Does your man ever fuck you in the ass?"</p> <p>"No, John doesn't have anything near as much as your husband does with his hands. He only does it to give me a better fuck." I rolled my eyes in disbelief. She stood up, her breasts swinging softly beneath her. She lifted my chin with both hands, and kissed me gently. "Now my dear John, you just had me convinced your wife really liked it." she smiled as she moved her hips seductively down to me, feeling the head of my erection pressing against her pussy. As she reached down to hold my dick where it was, she raised her hips higher until my dick was just barely able to push between her moist lips. She moved back and forth, making us both moan with the pleasure of it.</p> <p>I rolled my head back as she rubbed my dick up and down, feeling it slide between her moistness between her engorged lips. She slid the head up and down between her pussy lips. I moved my hips up into her, grinding my shaft against her lips, feeling her heat and wetness. She began grinding again, then lowered herself onto me, pushing my entire head up her cunt. We began to move in unison, feeling each other's heat, our bodiesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
