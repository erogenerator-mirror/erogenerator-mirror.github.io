Please, don't stop!"</p> <p>He stopped, his cock still lodged in my ass. I was on that same level of arousal as before but I was feeling my body responding to his touch. I felt his hand on my leg and then his leg, stroking my skin with his fingers. I tried to spread my legs and I think it wasn't very hard to do, so I did. His hand slid down my body, coming to rest at my ass and I felt him pressing his finger against the entrance, sliding it in just a little but not in very far. I moaned involuntarily. He moved it slightly, making my muscles relax a little. I felt him enter me again, just a little more of him.</p> <p>"Oh, please, Master, I want to be allowed access!"</p> <p>"I am here to give you complete pleasure," he whispered in my ear.</p> <p>He didn't ask for permission though. He wanted my permission and I felt my pussy starting to burn again.</p> <p>In the beginning he had asked me not to cum. I didn't want him to know I was enjoying it at the time but at the end of the day there was no reason not to cum as soon as I was allowed to cum. He would stop at one point and then start up again. During the day, I would come every chance I got and I could always count on him finding that sweet spot again and again. Now I felt him sliding into me at the end and he started to slowly slide in and out of me. I had to fight back the orgasm and that's when he stopped and got off me.</p> <p>He pulled me to him and rolled over on top of me, pushing his cock back into me and began pushing into my ass. He fucked me with it. I felt his hands pulling my head forward and I felt how his other hand was caressing my face and hair, stroking up and down, taking in just the right amount of pressure on my skin to enhance what I had already felt. He fucked me harder and faster, using and withdrawing his cock in a way that I could hear, see and feel. He could see how much of the head was in me and he knew I had cum. He kept telling me not to cum and to hold out as long as he could but I just couldn't. I could hear him moan as he fucked me and even see his hand reach over my face and grab handfuls of my hair. Then he exploded in me and I felt his juices running onto my stomach. He slid on top of me and we lay there on our sides, both sweaty and breathing hard.</p> <p>I looked up at him and he looked at me and I smiled. He reached and pulled up my shirt and kissed me, taking my nipple into his mouth and teasing it. Our wet lips melted together as we drifted toward sleepâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
