"We can go to my place or go out to a restaurant."</p> <p>"Why don't you call him over and I'll have him come over," she suggested.</p> <p>"That sounds good," Susan said. "I'm sure you know that I'm the only one that's willing to go out of our way."</p> <p>"I already know. It was easy to see that you've got the hots for him." I added.</p> <p>"It's OK. He's not the only one that's feeling that way, now."</p> <p>"Thanks," she said. "I think I know how that can be arranged. It's the best plan. Come on, it'll be fun."</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>I followed Susan through the parking lot and down a street that was a little less than fifteen minutes drive. With a few more turns down the street, I reached down and felt my cock stir once again. She didn't stop at our stop, but I didn't want to wait all night.</p> <p>We got to her house just before four in the morning, which was a good thing as I had been thinking about it all day. I was still excited as I walked up the walk to her door, but I wasn't a kid anymore, and I needed to make the best of it.</p> <p>I rang the bell, and Susan answered it in her house wearing a robe which she had slipped off for me. We were going to a dinner or something.</p> <p>"Hi, Jim," she greeted me. "You look beautiful."</p> <p>"I'm going for some swimming," I replied. "Are you going to swim around the block?"</p> <p>Susan laughed. "Oh, yes," she said. "I'm going to take a nice swim before you get so impatient."</p> <p>A few minutes later, I was swimming behind Susan's back, which made her breasts press against my torso as she laughed and joked. I couldn't help but wonder what her nipples looked like; it looked like they were hard as rocks. As we both made our way upstairs to the master bedroom, I felt as though I might never walk again.</p> <p>On the floor, Susan was lying on her stomach with her ass facing me as I knelt down on the carpet, my face inches from her pussy. She had on a tiny thong, just enough to cover nothing, showing that she had shaved her pussy when she'd woken up while having sex in her bathroom. Her ass was high in the air, its cheeks barely touching the carpet. I lifted my face and looked intently at her. She had this smile on her face and her hips moving as I was kneeling there looking at her. She had on no makeup but just the hint of a hint of perfume. "God, am I glad I shaved earlier," I muttered, before turning my head slightly to see what color her thong was. With a smile on my face, I raised my hand and gently touched her bare skin, making her jump.</p> <p>"I don't think I've ever felt anything like that in my life," I told her, in an almost sarcastic tone. "I always love a man that is so appreciative that he goes and does his laundry or something.</p> <p>"That's ok," she said, as an apology for the robe. "I never had sex in a bed. I've heard that guys do that to their wives. It's nice. But it didn't happen often, because it always started when I was really embarrassed."</p> <p>"It was a first for me. You certainly didn't seem embarrassed when you stripped before going to bed," I added.</p> <p>"Did you ever do it?" she asked.</p> <p>"After that night," I said. "It was all me and that was always me. It was the least I could do. It was a lot different than the way Bill and I used to act."</p> <p>"Did you ever try it with John again?" Susan asked.</p> <p>"You know that we've had this conversation about a hundred times." I said, wondering what she was referring to.</p> <p>"Maybe I should've talked to him about it," she said. Her eyes were closed and she had this little smile on her face.</p> <p>"I've never known you to tell me anything when you're with him," I said. "We never had the chance to talk about it. We know what we want and what we're willing to give it to."</p> <p>"Do I? Did you ever try it in front of John?" she asked.</p> <p>"Maybe," I said, thinking that she had to know that it was going to happen again.</p> <p>"I can believe that when I'm standing inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
