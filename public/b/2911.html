It didn't matter though, he was in no hurry now. They only had a few minutes. The sounds of their bodies rubbing against each other filled the room as they fucked and he grabbed her waist for leverage. "You're so fucking sexy." He said, as he felt her cunt contract over him. She couldn't think at all about what had just occurred with the way they'd gone past the point of no return. He felt her begin to cum, a warm gush of liquid coming from her core as she climaxed, her nails raking the skin of his back causing him to give a loud moan as his seed shot from his cock into her. He thrust several times into her and then pulled out, his cock glistening with her wetness. He leaned against her and looked to see the look of pure satisfaction on her face, even though he knew she could have said something. She didn't need to say anything at all. She leaned up and kissed him and then he leaned forward and lifted his body, allowing his soft spent member to fall toward her. She looked into his eyes and smiled, kissing him once again and then laid back down, still panting, feeling fulfilled and satisfied. They lay there for several minutes like that, their bodies still shaking with post coital release after their mutual orgasm and then he rolled over, resting his head on his hand. He looked at her and thought back to a similar vision he had when he first heard her coming in the door. "It was a big fucking day," he thought as he looked back to his room. He pulled himself off of the bed and walked into the bathroom to finish his shower. He'd just spent the day in that shower, one which he'd definitely not been in this afternoon. He was glad it hadn't come to an end. As he rinsed himself off and brushed his teeth, he looked once more and was surprised to see that he'd left that room. He had forgotten to lock the door. He quickly dressed, grabbed his boxers and slippers, and walked out of the bathroom and down the hall and back into the room. He walked out to the living room and pulled out his old book. It was titled 'The Best of The Best' and he loved it. They had even written another tome on the theme. He couldn't wait until he returned home to see it, if that was still the story. He smiled at the thought of her having that exact look again in those wallsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
