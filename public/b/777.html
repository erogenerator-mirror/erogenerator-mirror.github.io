It seemed clear as day. I was thinking about how I might start by kissing him. I was thinking about when he finally made a move. He was wearing a black thong, it felt so good against my bare skin. I thought about how it would feel to hold him and how he would hold me, how his body would move and feel against mine. I remembered how he loved to touch me there with his fingertips and I hoped that he would want the same. I imagined how I would feel if he was to feel my breasts against his shoulders and I imagined how I would feel if he pressed me in to him when we left the train. My thoughts were in a haze and I closed my eyes.</p> <p>I opened my eyes again and as I did he was getting very close to me, his hand on my stomach and then he was touching my breasts and nipples. I gasped, so soft I thought I might cry but his lips were next and when they touched mine I moaned, so soft and strong and erotic. His lips began to part and his tongue was in my mouth and I was kissing him, my arms about his neck as his hand was on my breast, exploring it.</p> <p>I thought about what he had looked like when he stripped and how different he was. I had heard about a man's cock and how it was bigger and felt better. My eyes were still closed, when his lips were on mine again. It would be so real, so natural, he would be kissing back and so want and wanting and loving me so much. I tried to be quiet, and I think I succeeded until he broke the kiss.</p> <p>He slid his right hand up my body and he squeezed my breast, his hand was so cold on my smooth skin. His fingers slid through my hair and over my shoulder to my left breast, my nipples were hard under his fingers and the nipples ached with the touch of his rough, hot hand. He slipped his hand back down and as he touched my crotch, he slid his finger between my lips, not as he was feeling when he had first touched my vagina, but then his finger slid down and into my body, sliding inside me, making me feel all hot and wet. His hand began to move again and I felt how my body was reacting and it was wonderful, but even if he weren't touching me, his finger slid deeper into my body as he slid it up and down, in and out, rubbing me, making me so wet.</p> <p>I opened my eyes and looked at him, thinking how I had looked and had felt while he was caressing me at the same time as I was touching him. I felt so good with him touching me, I wanted to feel what was happening to me. He was so beautiful. My eyes closed again and I could see his erection growing against the material of his shorts as he moved his lips to me, then he was kissing down my neck and the side of my breast before kissing down the center of my rib cage, down my abdomen to my right leg. I felt his breath on my mound which caused my hand to move with his as he slipped his tongue between my lips. I moaned, as his warm, wet tongue touched the top of my vagina.</p> <p>I felt his teeth as he lifted his head and when he looked up at me, my eyes had glazed over, my mouth open and I was moaning in passion. I knew I would have climaxed before he had any tongue. I had always wanted to experience a man's tongue and now his mouth was on me, kissing me. I felt him move his tongue up and down inside me as he moved it in and out of me and his finger slipped further into my body as he licked the top of my legs. I was arching my back, as I held his head against me, as I enjoyed the sensations, as I could take. His lips touched mine and we kissed, our tongues fighting as he tasted and felt me, as he tasted for myself.</p> <p>I saw him glance up at me and then he was looking down at me, with me, lying there, totally naked, but for underwear, my legs open, my mouth open, my hands moving, spreading my legs, exposing everything for him to see. I felt so beautiful and wanton; being able to allow myself to be this fully exposed to him, so available, for him to touch me and make me feel wonderful. With my legs spread, I knew that he could see everything, and I felt so alive, so alive and so very excited. He looked up at me, still licking me, as he watched the expressions on my face. His hand moved so delicately, the fingers were stroking my pussy, then he was putting his finger inside me.</p> <p>I was so wet, I felt his finger slide up my wetness and he had to have a taste if he really wantedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
