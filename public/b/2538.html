Now you're going in there with me and not back out." She said as she walked around behind him and held his arms out and slowly slid his t-shirt up his body. At this point, all he could do was take the pressure off his shoulders and arms as it went up his back and over his skin. He was now completely naked under his sister's skirt.</p> <p>"Oh, that feels good, brother." She said as she slid his t-shirt over his head and tossed it aside, exposing his shoulders and back.</p> <p>As she moved around a bit her lips went straight for his nipples while her hands slid slowly up his sides to his ass. While working down, she spread his butt crack and just lightly ran her fingertips down his crack. She pressed against his balls a bit and they felt hot. His cock was standing tall at full attention. The tip was almost touching the floor and she slid it between her hands, then up against his shaft. His skin felt hot and smooth as he shifted in his seat, but it also felt like they were sticking straight up. Her fingers ran up and down the length of his cock from the head that she already had in her hand, pausing only when they reached the swollen tip. He closed his eyes in anticipation while she kept her other hand at the base of his shaft. Her fingers worked slowly up and down and around it, but just the tip while her hand slid in and out.</p> <p>He felt her grip his cock and it almost jumped and started to move between her two hands. She pulled the head back slightly with her thumb, then slid it around the ridge and slowly slid back. This made him jump in response. She slid the entire head and shaft back into her hand as she slid her thumb in. He felt her press in as tightly as she could and felt the skin just press down against her hand. Her thumb didn't move though as she slowly slid it in and out of his anus. Each slide of her thumb brought a small squish that went from one side to another.</p> <p>After a few moments of this she started to slide her hand up his shaft again and slowly slid it up, keeping it just behind the base. She repeated this a few more times while her hand moved up and down his full length once more. Her fingers were stroking the tip at a steady pace, but every time they got a little higher she started to wiggle her hand like she had done every other time. She felt the tingling going on down here and then back up. Her hands were sliding over the shaft and over his head while she worked her thumb around and over the ridge. She had learned how he liked it. He seemed to be having a little trouble breathing, although as her hand slid up and down he was probably doing the same.</p> <p>One of her hands slid under her and took a hold of his cock that her other hand now was holding in place. The tips of her hands were stroking up and down the length of his cock almost perfectly. His balls were almost completely exposed though they still were in their sack. She leaned forward and slid her lips down the shaft as far as they would go as her lips went between his legs. He was so aroused his cock felt like steel and could feel that his member was pushing through her fingers. It was all that he could do not to start fucking her mouth. But it was still nice to feel his body pressed to hers and his hands on her. She held her lips against his head for only a fraction of a second, then slid them slowly all the way down until she could feel her lips against the head of his cock.</p> <p>"Oh yeah." He said. "Just there."</p> <p>She slid her lips slowly up and down his cock, feeling it move in the back of her mouth.</p> <p>"That's how it feels." She heard him say. "That's all that's important."</p> <p>After a few minutes more, she heard him ask, "Are we ready to go home?"</p> <p>"If you are." She said.</p> <p>"That will do for starters." He said. He was almost fully hard again.</p> <p>"How hard?" She asked.</p> <p>"Very." he said.</p> <p>"How about if we just go upstairs so we can do it doggy style." He said.</p> <p>It didn't take her long to get over on her hands and knees. She crawled up the stairs and quickly followed. As soon as they were upstairs she felt him pull her hair out of one side and then rub his cock in her face. She closed her eyes as he positioned it over her lips. He moved it just slightly and she took it into her mouth as far as she could go. Then he moved it back up her body until it brushed against herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
