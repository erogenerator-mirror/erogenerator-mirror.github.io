Heather was her best friend and even though she knew Heather loved to flirt, this is what really turned her on her being a cheerleader. I think the two of them got it on so much better than me.</p> <p>We sat on the couch and the two of them talked about everything. I was trying to keep one thing from coming out but Heather had other ideas. She started the conversation "So, what was my secret friend's sexual desires I told you about last night? Were they a big clue to my sexual side?"</p> <p>"No, no, we haven't discussed them yet." I said.</p> <p>"Well that's probably because you never said I'm a one man woman." Heather said with more confidence than before. (I wasn't even thinking about doing her tonight when she mentioned that.)</p> <p>"You're right Heather, he was really sweet to me but I knew we were one. It felt as though he was just another guy trying to get in my panties and we would talk about a lot of stuff without having to share him with you. I think he wasn't even trying, just playing around with me, but if he had tried it would have been pretty difficult with you."</p> <p>Heather smiled and then told me about when he started trying to get me to have anal sex, and how that just ended when he said something which seemed to bother him. That's when we knew he might have been telling the truth. Heather laughed at my question. I told her Heather was hot but I was being a dick and she was my friend not her best friend. That's when we decided to have a drink and go home.</p> <p>She said we had agreed that everything was normal between us but I never had any problems with Heather. "You do have to admit Heather, you are a knockout." Heather smiled again. I was feeling a little light headed. What could this mean for the relationship between us? I mean what would our secret friends say about us if they knew we were friends. Heather gave me a sly little smile. "I'll tell you more about tomorrow with me." She said.</p> <p>We agreed to be going home that night to her place after the movie was over. I had been trying to remember just what my secret friends sexual desires were. Heather told me she planned to do something to them too but I wanted to know where.</p> <p>A few days later Heather called me and asked if I had a surprise for me. She said that she wanted to have sex with me. We had already discussed it before. She asked me the same thing I had to do after the same thing happened the night before. I just shrugged my shoulders and said yes. Heather then asked if I would do it again. I was unsure for a second but then I thought I would jump on it. I could really only be too nervous to actually have sex with Heather again but then I thought again about Heather. Heather and I always did it in her bedroom when we had fun and if I had sex with someone else than it was a different feeling.</p> <p>Heather started to give me her name. Heather told me she had a friend named Joanne so they should know each other when they came over. Heather asked me what I thought about it and if I wanted to talk about it. She was going to bring her friend to Heather's house, because it had to be something like that. I started to answer yes but then realized Heather was going to want the same thing. The thought was crazy and I shook my head to clear the thoughts away.</p> <p>A few days went by without Heather and me talking about it. Heather then asked me if I wanted to go to Joanne's house and get a girl friend. Again the simple question I had was, how did I want to do it. Heather told me the answer was simple. I would go to Heather's house and get a girl friend and get the same thing Joanne had just done. Heather told me to be in her bedroom and wait for Heather to arrive. That's when Heather and I came together and agreed to go to Joanne's house.</p> <p>When Heather arrived at Joanne's house I was sitting on her couch in my cheerleading uniform. Heather said she had been waiting for me. Heather stood in front of me as I sat down on the couch next to her. Heather leaned into me and she kissed me. Heather pulled her sweater off so I could see Heather's beautiful breasts through the fabric of her cheerleading uniform. Heather's bra was a sheer white with little red hearts around the cups. Heather had the largest nipples in the world.</p> <p>We held each other for a while before Heather's bra fell away and our kissing became more intense. Heather leaned back so her breast was in my face and I closed my eyes. Heather had a hard time getting her breast out, so she got her strap and pulled it off beforeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
