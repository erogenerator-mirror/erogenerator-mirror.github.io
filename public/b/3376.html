She was still shaking, still moaning, and still feeling the aftershocks of her own orgasm. With a great deal of regret, she said, "God, my pussy feels so ssshit."</p> <p>Jenny gave her a dirty look, then smiled at Celeste. "So, you think it's good to fuck a woman who loves to do that?" Jenny asked.</p> <p>"Uh, hell yes, hon. I love fucking you, to tell you the truth."</p> <p>"Don't you mean you love fucking my pussy?" Celeste asked. She leaned back, and looked down at Jenny, who was still watching them from the bed she was on from the doorway, and smirked.</p> <p>"I really do, sweetheart." Jenny kissed her, and let her hands go to rest on her breasts. Jenny reached her arms down over her body, and cupped Celeste's mound, caressing her as Celeste's head went back against the headboard. She leaned back, pressing her torso against Jenny, letting her arms come in to play.</p> <p>Jenny took her time with Celeste, moving slowly and teasingly, teasing a nipple with her thumb, sliding it between her thumb and forefinger, and then lightly pinching that one, making the other one even firmer. The fingers of her left hand were lightly touching her own breasts, kneading her. Jenny pushed Celeste down on the bed and got in close, whispering as she teased Celeste's clitoris with little strokes of her tongue, "So, do you like that, sweetie?"</p> <p>"Oh yes, hon," said Celeste. She closed her eyes as Jenny's mouth went back down to suck hard on her pussy. Her right hand was holding Jenny's, rubbing her hard nipples with her fingertips as her tongue probed Jenny's slit. Her left hand went to Jenny's hair, and she pulled the strands back over her face. Both sisters began moving faster as their orgasm approached.</p> <p>"Ahhhhhhh!" groaned Jenny. "Yes! Oh yes!"</p> <p>Suddenly, Celeste began to cry out: "I'm going to come! I'm going to come!" Her face went white as she climaxed hard. She screamed, a muffled cry, and grabbed Jenny, pulling her close. Celeste's body shook, quivering, convulsing as if she was on the precipice.</p> <p>In her moment of pleasure, Jenny knew Celeste was ready. Without saying a word, she kissed her, and pushed Celeste back. As Celeste was getting off the bed, pulling Jenny to her feet, Jenny wrapped her arms around her, kissing her like they were lovers, as they got dressed. Jenny's head was on Celeste's thigh, her hands running up her taut belly to cup her breast.</p> <p>"Oh my," she purred. "Your tits are as sexy as ever."</p> <p>"I know, hon. Their all swollen and full of milk." Jenny said, and kissed Celeste again. "We'd better be going."</p> <p>The girls got dressed, and Jenny put their stuff back inside the door, as Celeste looked on.</p> <p>"You're such a babe," Jenny said. "C'mon, honey and I'll see you later."</p> <p>"Alright," said Celeste. She got up and ran toward the bathroom. Jenny was already waiting there, her taut body glistening with sweat. "That was incredible," she said. "You're such a dirty girl."</p> <p>Jenny grinned. "Yeah, I have to admit that I'm horny as a rock. But I just have to see what Jenny is doing with the pictures. She's just fucking crazy."</p> <p>Before Jenny was dressed, she was busy going to the bathroom. She found her phone sitting on the bed, and checked it. Jenny had been on her way back to the bathroom when Celeste came bounding out of it.</p> <p>"Hiya, Jenny," she said, and hugged her. Jenny kissed her on the cheek, and grabbed the phone. "Hey, babe, it's you!"</p> <p>"I'm sorry, hon. I just had to stop by to pick up the phone in case I forgot to put it on."</p> <p>It was so quick, so unexpected. Her voice was still so calm, no trace of emotion or anger or accusation. "It's okay," Jenny said. I heard what was going on. I'm going to call back in the morning."</p> <p>"Uh, okay," said Celeste. "I'll be waiting. Bye. Love you," and she grabbed Jenny's hand, and they both ran out of the room hand in handâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
