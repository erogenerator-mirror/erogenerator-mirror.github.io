I was hoping it was just a friendly touch. The softness of her skin under my fingertips brought back to my erection, which it was all too happy to be free from the confines of my pants, and I slipped another finger into her wet slit, causing her to shudder as if she had been electrified. She brought her mouth to mine to taste, as if a new taste was being passed on to my mouth, as if it needed my tongue more than I did.</p> <p>"There now, that's right. I guess I was starting to think you wouldn't even kiss me after what I did?" she said after a few moments of that.</p> <p>"I'm not that great of a kisser, but I do have a thing for kissing." I replied.</p> <p>She seemed to relax in my arms for a bit, but then her arms got up to give me some room to sit up. I slid from hers and sat on the stool with her. I had to put a foot or two back on the edge of the desk.</p> <p>"Oh, my god," she exclaimed, "that was...wow...."</p> <p>I think we started laughing. She pulled herself off the desk and turned into my arms. Somehow, she got her legs around my waist and we resumed our position on the desk. "What's a nice boy like myself to do?"</p> <p>I had my arms around her as she wrapped her arms around my back, and my fingers stroked the small of her back with my fingertips. It was then that I realized she wasn't wearing any panties.</p> <p>"Oh, my," she said, again with a little too much enthusiasm, "for a grown man..."</p> <p>"You can't wait, then, honey."</p> <p>"N-n-no, I can't wait." Her face was flushed and her lips were swollen with lust. "I love you, you know."</p> <p>"I know," I assured her. I knew that I wasn't going to take advantage of this woman I loved, especially since we were a couple and we knew what she'd like a thing like this. "You're beautiful, too."</p> <p>She gave a little squeeze of my bare flesh. "You're one of the nicest guys I've ever known, and I guess I've known you most of my life so long that I've known no one this sweet."</p> <p>I felt the warmth and gentleness of her body against mine, and knew that I could feel a good degree of lust in the pit of my stomach. We looked deeply and deeply into each others eyes, and for a moment I felt a tingle, just as mine was.</p> <p>"And you smell good," I told her, and she just grinned slightly at my response.</p> <p>"And you, me," she said, "are the most beautiful and gentle man I've ever met. I've had lovers before, but the ones that I wanted to have made me feel young for the first time. My husband was a better kisser and better lover than that, even if it was kind of hard for a young thing like you to admit. I hope you don't mind," she added with some seriousness and a little sarcasm.</p> <p>"Not at all," I assured her. "I feel like a teenager on prom night."</p> <p>"Well, not only that, but I feel I have the first thing that moves tonight right now," with that, she kissed me softly. I responded without thought. Our lips joined, and she opened them so I could slide my tongue along its surface. Her lips were soft, like butterfly wings on sweet honey; the softness of a butterfly wing, and the strength of a butterfly is a powerful, yet dangerous force. I kissed her with deep hunger, her kissing me with abandon.</p> <p>My hands started massaging her ass cheeks, and I felt the muscles in her thighs tense against my fingers.</p> <p>"My turn," she growled after a few moments. We kissed again, as if each other had done this a dozen times before. It was a deep, sensual, and very erotic experience.</p> <p>We broke our embrace and she pushed herself towards me. I sat up as well, and put one hand on her naked belly to encourage her to kneel before me, as she turned to take off my pants, and slide her skirt and underwear off and lay them on the table in a heap. My trousers and boxers fell to the floor and I was left standing, naked, with my clothes lying to the floor, on top of one of the desks.
