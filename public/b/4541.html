I'm sure we'll have your body available to play with when you get home, and as soon as things settle down, we'll have you in the office with no interruptions. You'd be free to take care of yourself all morning. I'd like that."</p> <p>He watched her eyes grow heavy as the idea and the proposal entered his head. He wasn't sure if what she wanted was in fact what she meant, "I don't think so. You seem to be more of an animal than I am."</p> <p>"I love you, too, David, so you won't have to suffer. You won't either."</p> <p>"I need to get away, honey." He said, "I'll pick up some things at the office, so I'll call you when my office is open. I'll get home early tomorrow." He kissed her gently.</p> <p>As he was leaving the office he stopped and noticed the tears rolling down her face. He thought to himself, she's beautiful. She should love him just the same. She wouldn't be in that situation, but she wasn't a good girl. She just needed someone that liked her.</p> <p>He was going to leave before it was too late and he couldn't see the need to stay to do anything, so he'd take the time to rest and enjoy her company. He also thought, 'I'm not a bad guy, I just need to get back to my wife. Maybe if I took the time instead of trying to have something to do while I'd still love her, I might be inclined to do that. She's just not into the kinds of crap that we do in her office. That'd be another example of what was going on. She might think that when she got home from work tomorrow that he might think that she loved him, but he'd been wrong. It made him feel good knowing that she wanted him too as well.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Chapter 38</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>I just don't know what I want right now. I've gotten so fucking worked up. I feel like I'm on the verge of doing something stupid. I'm so fucking tired. I want to go to sleep. All the memories I've had of the last few days are coming back, and when I get home... They're coming in big circles. I'm afraid I may never touch all of these memories.</p> <p></p> <p>I didn't really have to put up much of a fight. She made my life hell. Even if I hated her, and there were a lot of things that I needed to think about and do, I could not say that I loved her or that I hadn't gotten to a point. I could not make myself break down crying, even if it was a little bit. It's just not like that in the real world.</p> <p></p> <p>I woke the next morning to find the house was almost completely deserted. I realized then that I was alone and that I had been crying when I woke up. I got up, washed up, threw on a robe, came downstairs and sat at the kitchen table. My hand was shaking, and I was worried, "Are you okay? What happened to you?"</p> <p>My God, I was so fucked up, "We needed to talk. I've been a fool and I'm sorry, but I did nothing. I'm so ashamed."</p> <p>"Do you think that you really love me?"</p> <p>"Yes, yes. Of course I love you. Who's going to believe me? You look good, but you're still hurting. If she had said something to you in the past, I know she wouldn't have done it. I have to think that I love her just as much as you. But I'm so sorry."</p> <p>"Do you think that I would go to work and have it be because of what I did that day?"</p> <p>"I guess not, but I do believe that you could never leave if she really loved you."</p> <p>I sat there with my head in my hands and tears were running down my face. I wasn't happy about it all, but I had to find a way to give them space.</p> <p>"Listen, why don't you meet me for lunch tomorrow. I'll be here at 7:30. Are you hungry?"</p> <p>"Yes, I'm starving."</p> <p>"Dont worry. We're in the mood to talk."</p> <p>I'm so sorry I said that to her anyway. I have to think that she was sincere when she said that. She was right. I wouldn't have let her hurt me that much if I didn't think that she loved me.</p> <p>She saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
