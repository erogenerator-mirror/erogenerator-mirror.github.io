I whispered, tears forming in my eyes.</p> <p>"It's okay darling - you don't need to explain, you're my partner in crime." She said gently as if this was a new world. "It's just that you and I are still married." she added, giving my cheek a soft pat. Then she sighed and leaned over to kiss me lightly on the lips.</p> <p>I tried to say something but she cut me off "No, sweetheart you can't - you're married! It would be wrong for anybody to just open their mouth and say "what the fuck am I doing" - for Christ's sake, isn't this just too much?" She didn't sound as concerned as a couple of weeks ago when she said "just fuck it, I'm a married woman." Then her eyes softened and she leaned back, still holding me with her hand.</p> <p>"Look, we need to calm down - I've got to get out of here." I heard her get up and head to the door. In the meanwhile Trudy and I just stood there, watching her walk out and close the door.</p> <p>"Well honey, you sure know how to get something done - why don't we sit upstairs so we can get to know each other better. You can start by saying that you're married - that you want to be married when you're with me." She joked, with a smile.</p> <p>"Well Trudy, you've got to tell me I'm married first and then later on, before you open your mouth again." I said with mock innocence. Then I turned to Trudy. "And if...?" I began, but she cut in, not wanting to leave and not wanting to keep talking. "So then what?" she asked. "Then where's the fun anyway?" Trudy giggled and I nodded to her. "How about now?" She said, grinning again.</p> <p>"OK" I agreed, not wanting to make a fool of myself again. I felt rather silly in Trudy's arms, being able to hold her while we talked but not feeling like I couldn't keep my hands off her, all the while thinking "How can I be such a fool if I have a gorgeous partner like you in my arms". I was starting to love the attention I was getting, and the feeling of Trudy's hard, naked shoulders against my own was starting to feel nice in a strange way. I glanced at the clock and it read 1:34, Trudy had probably taken a walk all the way over, having gotten caught looking in her locker. At any rate, I couldn't let it get any better. By the time we were getting up to go meet her parents I was thinking about our "date" anyway and I was sure that it wouldn't go too far, but I knew I couldn't tell her to leave so I just smiled back at Trudy and we went into the living room. We sat there kissing and caressing each other's bodies, just reliving the past few days. Trudy's hands were starting to get busy too, starting with my chest and fondling me and then finally, my face.</p> <p>My nipples swelled in response to Trudy's skill and her kisses became more insistent. We were both breathing hard when I could hear a zipper being pulled open and my skirt was lifted up over my hips.</p> <p>"Is that really what you want, sweetheart?" she asked, smiling to herself as she stared at my naked and eager pussy.</p> <p>"Oh God yes!" I replied enthusiastically. Just then I felt Trudy rubbing my ass gently, her fingers rubbing my hole lightly. Then she began to rub me with a more insistent pressure.</p> <p>"Are you sure you don't want to...?" Trudy asked, rubbing my anus again.</p> <p>"Not really dear - it's just - it's just... really naughty that I'm getting your touch - do you want me to stop?" I said.</p> <p>"No, it's just that I feel really hot, like this, being touched, and it's really naughty, and I don't know if I want to enjoy it too much..." Trudy said. I could feel the vibrations she was rubbing in my pussy and I closed my eyes for a moment, enjoying her touch, and then my hand was pulled from between us and I felt something warm and sticky slide under my hand. I looked up in surprise... Trudy's tongue was licking me.</p> <p>"Wow - how the hell did you do that? You're wet," I exclaimed, as if she'd said something terrible and shocked me. (I thought she might have said something worse.)</p> <p>"Oh sweetheart, I'm sure you like it - just do like it and don't object" She said asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
