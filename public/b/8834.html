Please."</p> <p>She smiled and pulled him under her arm. As she walked out the door and out to the lobby she pulled out an envelope and a pen and handed them to Paul. He couldn't tell if they were hers or not. It was a small envelope, but it clearly contained what she wanted. He got her note for them, and opened the box. Inside was a gold-wool choker with a chain encircling it. He pulled it on and saw it was a very tight fit. Her breasts felt heavy in it, and as she walked he could feel himself getting hard. He felt embarrassed as he walked up to her. He hugged her and whispered, "I love you so much." They walked back to the car, and drove off.</p> <p>Paul told Linda about his new job, and how much they had been enjoying it. The following day Paul was promoted to manager. He spent a lot of time in the gym and was able to get some weight on the new bodybuilder. But he knew it would take a lot of work to get his body back. He also had to change his diet. He tried diet caterers, but that too was becoming more difficult than he wanted. He also got rid of all of his gym visits. His diet was also becoming extremely difficult to maintain. That was partially due to not having as much time on the treadmill as he used to. He thought about Linda being there when he exercised daily, but couldn't see how he could manage it. His wife's death probably wouldn't put her at the gym, but maybe he could talk to her about it sometime. Linda said she hated to leave him home, but she was glad he was working so hard. Paul told her he missed her and told her about her death. They fell asleep and woke up in the middle of the night, when the doorbell rang. He didn't open the door, afraid her neighbors might see them.</p> <p>Linda got an envelope and two photographs. First was a picture of her with her husband on the bottom, and on the other side was a video. It was a picture of his wife lying on him, still being fucked by her lover. They also had a photo of her holding the guy's cock in her mouth, but her mouth was only covered.</p> <p>The other pictures included another three-way that their eyes would only see. The video showed him sucking her fingers off as they fucked. She was sucking him dry, and she was enjoying it as much as he was. The picture showed a young couple fucking on top of their bed. The wife was fucking one and he was fucking the other. They appeared to be making out, and I'm sure the husband couldn't hear anything.</p> <p>A note appeared in his hand. It read, "I wanted to thank Paul for not having to use your house." The note went on to say that she could use his house as a guest room. He was hoping she would come and use his as much as he liked. He said they'd talk next week. She looked at the note, and then smiled.</p> <p>When Paul arrived the following week, Linda asked him what he wanted. He thought about it for a minute then said, "I'm not sure. I mean, we do take a lot of time together. Where do we start?"</p> <p>Linda smiled and then giggled. "I don't think it's such a good idea yet," and she leaned forward and began licking his lips. At the same time she wrapped her arms around his neck and her mouth went to his ear. He felt her breath against his ear as he whispered, "I'll call you."</p> <p>Linda drove Paul to the airport and let him into a waiting car. He was worried that they might have a fight, but they went to his car and left. They arrived at the resort and waited for the limo to get there. During the drive, they talked. He was glad her marriage was finally over, because this was going to be even harder than he had thought. They got inside and Linda asked him to undress the rest of the way. Then she pulled some sexy white panty hose on and a garter belt. While she did that, she unbuttoned his shirt and started unzipping it.</p> <p>She asked him, "Did you just unzip?" She stopped and looked around at the other limos in the lot. He saw one with the driver kneeling while a black guy was getting sucked off by a white guy on the wheel. The driver was watching from a distance as two men were standing with their cocks in the hands of two different men sucking and fucking the cocks in front of them. "I thought you wanted to see what it looked like," he said. He didnâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
