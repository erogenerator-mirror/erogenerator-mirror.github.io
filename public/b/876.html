Are you reading my head? Are you writing this out of sympathy? Am I going to read it in my head? I have to stop this now. I'll make a decision later.</p> <p>I'm ready to hear this final goodbye, and I'll tell you now: I'm not going to let that last sentence drop into the dirt.</p> <p>You might be wondering why I decided to read it in my head. I don't know why I did, if I did, she'd do it all again, so that I could have it, and it was a very good choice; she probably had another one of her own, and probably had the idea of me fucking her, too. But you see, if I kept on like this, there would be no telling if she would ever cheat on me. I think I'd just become so desperate to have her, that she'd make her move quickly.</p> <p>So, I decided I would read this in my head. Maybe it was better to write out something else later, because it was much clearer than I was.</p> <p>If you're reading it, I understand. I was hoping that a bit more detail would be helpful.</p> <p>YOUR STORY</p> <p>I read her story about a month ago, in which she told me that she had a boyfriend at the time, named Jim, and that she had arranged that he would seduce her when she turned eighteen, so she could have a real boyfriend. And, in another place, we got this close to what happens when she starts her period, right? And she got this boyfriend and told him that she'd had a menstrual period that day, before he fucked her. And, as she finished his story, we both got pretty horny, and I suggested we went upstairs so that she could show me how she did it. She was so hesitant and scared the first time, I almost had to make love to her to really keep myself from pushing the foreplay around, and then, she started to let me know how things went at home. And, I've been a pretty terrible teacher, so we've been really, really careful. And I really love it sometimes, but I don't give her as much of a deal as guys.</p> <p>"It's not that I don't like her being a little bit of a girl. Like the stories in the stories are about her. Like being a little girl and having to do what she's told me to do for her boyfriend. So, I have to say we're getting along pretty well there. And I can see some of the things she's had going, but she never acts as much as she is now about it. And it's not as if we were hiding anything, but I really like this whole thing. There are lots of nice things about being a naughty girl. And, I guess I love it at the same time. "</p> <p>And that was why it hit me that she had never been the least bit embarrassed to tell me that she got sexually stimulated by the stories in the stories because, in most cases, if it's not what you're looking at and I'm watching and reading, it's more than you'd think. And, it would be really hard on her to think that she would cheat on you, or anything about herself, and it was hard for her if she hadn't been so turned on.</p> <p>And, my last thought was, maybe this is the answer to my final decision.</p> <p>It didn't work out.</p> <p>If she hadn't been so concerned for me, that is. Her father has really turned her on though, and she was afraid that if she did anything, it would be just something you read about in your head. But, if it didn't work, then I suppose it's her choice. So far everything is working out, so to speak, if only a little bit different with little chance of getting her pregnant, she didn't need much. Maybe it's just that she's become so much more relaxed about being more open about it, it's just that she is doing things that she doesn't even think of doing herself. So, it's up to her.</p> <p>What can I say? I have no idea. But, maybe it's better this way since this is my final decision.</p> <p>The End (to be Continued...)â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
