He held me close to him like that for a long time. He took the edge off his anger and then he smiled and it was so easy. He was looking at me like a predator. He gently brought my head so it was level with his, his fingers on my cheek he said, "Babe", and as he said it I felt like a queen.</p> <p>He looked at me and for a moment I was scared. I did not understand why I did this to him. Then he kissed me, hard and it was like heaven to me. He pulled at my breasts as our tongues explored each other's bodies. He was holding my ass-cheeks tightly as my moans of pleasure grew louder. I could feel my pussy starting to clench with passion. He took that as his cue and pushed his tongue into this sweet wet pink tunnel as far as it would go and I felt a tremor and a wetness of warmth.</p> <p>After he made love to me he gently laid me on my back and he positioned himself between my thighs which were spread wide open. I saw the look in his eyes as he brought himself up to me. He looked like a predator as he rubbed himself against mine. I thought to myself, he is so dominant and all he needs is to be the perfect Dom. There were tears and I wanted him to want me. I closed my eyes and began to cry as if on cue. He kissed me and whispered, "Babe, I will protect you but you will never have to know."</p> <p>He positioned himself between my thighs and with a smile that said he was on the attack as I was by him, he brought himself to me once more and with a quick thrust he buried himself into me. My body stiffened and I felt as if I was going to pass out, but instead, a feeling of euphoria filled me as I felt the fullness of his huge cock. It filled me. He slowly moved inside me, his eyes locked with mine as his hands gently stroked my face, my hair, my shoulders, my nipples. He slowly went in and out of me slowly, building speed and depth until I thought I would be coming but for him I was never going to be that. He was still taking me, building speed and intensity with little fumbling movements. My heart was pounding and I knew I was a goner. He grabbed my waist and continued to slowly stroke in and out of me while I moaned his name and arched my back and begged for him to take more. I had thought of fucking him just once just once, but he seemed different and the feeling all around me seemed like a little more and when he increased his speed and force, it took me to the brink of tears. Suddenly, I felt him hit bottom, he held himself still inside as his body quaked in my arms.</p> <p>He smiled as he looked down at my flushed face, my hair, my breasts, my face and he said, "Babe, I love your eyes" as he started to rock himself against me slowly.</p> <p>"Oh my God, I love your eyes", I moaned with a deep, sensual voice.</p> <p>"That's so hot". He was breathing heavily and looking at me as he began to ride me. He had brought me to the edge but had stopped. All I knew was that I wanted it to never stop. I looked down at his beautiful, muscular body. I wanted him inside of me, I wanted to feel his hard muscles and feel him inside of me.</p> <p>"Oh no," I thought. I want to see his cock inside of me, I need to feel that big dick in me..." I continued to look at him. He smiled at me and leaned down to kiss me. I held his head and kissed him softly as I opened my mouth to him and we shared the kiss as lovers. We tasted each other for the first time, his salty tongue exploring my mouth and his hard cock in my pussy. He moved more quickly and harder inside me. It seemed like we were going to explode together as I felt my legs clench around him with every thrust. My orgasm exploded into me but I had no idea how much time we had both been taking to each other.</p> <p>"Oh, I can't...not anymore", I managed to get out between gasps. His body convulsed as he began to move inside of me, his hips moving with me as he came with me. I felt my pussy muscles clenching on his dick as I felt the spasms in his body as they built again with me. I was in heaven and could have lived forever.</p> <p>We lay there in a long hot wet embrace as he ran his fingers gently through my hair. Our bodies melted together and the heat and passion of our lovemaking made us both weak to speak.
