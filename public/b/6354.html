Can’t really stay up, what with everything.”</p> <p>Gwen walked off, walking down the sidewalk towards her house. She stopped to call back and see if she could get her mother’s room. The front door was open and she went in to her room. Then she went back on the phone to call mom.</p> <p>Mom called back just as Gwen answered the phone. As she picked up, she could see Gwen’s face on the phone.</p> <p>“Mom?” Gwen asked with confusion.</p> <p>“Yes, dear. Mom’s in room 1005. Mommy is here.”</p> <p>Mom could see Gwen’s face on the telephone. Mom had to take this call because she was worried.</p> <p>“Mom, I’m about ten feet in front of that door. Can you come over? There’s no way we can go up on your porch.”</p> <p>“Ok Gwen, but you better come quick or you won’t be able to walk until the first of next week until I can figure something out.”</p> <p>“OK Mom, I’m here. Just let me grab my overnight bag and we can get going.”</p> <p>With that, Gwen ran to her room. Gwen’s mind was conflicted between her fear of being rejected by her mother and her decision to take her home. She had no idea what to do. Her mother was about a hundred inches taller and stronger than her. She had a beautiful face and her hair was a great shape. Mom could see her arms well as they were long and thick and stood almost ten feet. Gwen took her bags and hurried across the front porch and onto her daughter’s front porch.</p> <p>As she approached, Mom was relieved that she didn’t go to her room. She’d only go to Gwen’s and then mom was going to be alone. Gwen would have to give her mother the address and when she got there, she would be alone. After getting a brief glance in the mirror, she saw Gwen’s mom’s blue eyes look over her naked body. Mom looked like a young girls’ dream come true. Then Gwen could see her mom’s breasts move up her body.</p> <p>“You must be lonely out in your old house, dear. Go and have a beer and cool off before going to bed.” said Mom.</p> <p>Gwen returned to her daughter’s front porch and sat down to have her first beer. As her mother came out, Gwen felt a flush against her body.</p> <p>“Gwen, dear, you look good.”</p> <p>“Thanks Mommy but I needed something else today, so I got home and was feeling a bit uncomfortable. I guess I’d better go and change, that was an order,” Gwen said turning to walk down the steps of the house.</p> <p>“No we can’t go any more this afternoon. I wanted to surprise you for your eighteenth birthday today, so you better not be too cold and just leave the lights on. I’m sure we can find something to do together. Here, I’ll take you someplace, just let mommy get you settled.”</p> <p>Mom was still looking at Gwen’s backside when Gwen had walked back through the house to her front porch. Mom saw Gwen’s long legs move from up high to down over her knees and then there was a long sway as she walked. Mom was staring in wonder at Gwen’s body. Her mother’s mind was a blank and then a sudden flashback. Her eyes had been fixed on Gwen’s breasts. Now they were moving up and over her mother’s legs. Mom had never taken a close look at a female and Gwen’s body was so much larger than her own.</p> <p>“Well, well, well. We were wondering if it was worth the effort this summer, Gwen. I guess this can be the weekend. I can have a cold beer in the morning and if I go to sleep, I’ll be glad to take care of your birthday present.”</p> <p>“Geez mom, you want you can’t have both of us.”</p> <p>“It’s ok dear, I’m sure you’ll find something to do. Come on, let’s go down to the dock and see how it looks.”</p> <p>Gwen followed her mother down to the dock and watched as—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
