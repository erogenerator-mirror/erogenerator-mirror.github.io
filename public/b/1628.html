I wanted to be in complete control. Everything else, the sensations, the smells, everything felt completely and completely right to me. I wanted his cock, just as he had my mouth. My own hand had drifted down my stomach, just barely touching my pussy. My head tilted back as my tongue slipped out and licked the underside of his shaft where it disappeared down between her legs. I felt his hand on my ass, spreading me open. I could barely breathe. I wanted him in me. I knew I was.</p> <p>I was so eager to please him. I wanted him to feel the fullness of me for his pleasure. I wanted him to fill my throat with his cum as I swallowed it down. I wanted him to cum in my throat. I wanted him to fill me with his own juices...</p> <p>I was shaking, my chest heaving with excitement. I wanted to be as wet as I could be for him. I was dying to suck his cock. I wanted to be the object of his lust and his desire, of being taken. I wanted to feel what it was like to surrender to his dominance - to his desire for me. I wanted it all, no barriers, no boundaries. I wanted to be his. I wanted it all.</p> <p>I felt his body tense, but his hands held me fast, just holding me. His legs were wide open, his body shuddering. He held me for a moment, not yet moving a finger, just feeling the weight of it and its warmth. His breath came in gasps and his body went rigid... and then stiffen again. I felt him, deep in my mouth, his cock growing even bigger. I felt every throb, every pulse, in my mouth.</p> <p>"Oh my god," he murmured, almost too loud.</p> <p>I smiled around him. "Yes, I know. All the way in," my voice came as one word. I was his and would do whatever was right for him. I knew. It was what I was - so wet, so eager...</p> <p>His hands held me hard, and then he released me before I could catch my breath again. "Turn over on the bed," he ordered, pointing to his bed. He didn't seem afraid or intimidated. He just had a look of confidence.</p> <p>I did as I was told. I turned around slowly and then back over onto it. Just as I had the first, I felt something wet and cold touch my skin. My eyes fluttered open, and I felt his hands press into me. I felt him inside me, as though he were pressing in a large, hard object inside me - something strong. I felt full, like every part of me was being pulled in as he filled me. I was moaning.</p> <p>The next shock to my system hit me just the same way - like the first, but a lot more pleasant. I heard someone else moaning and I felt some sort of liquid drip from the inside of me in a warm, moist, wonderful...</p> <p>"Good girl," he said as he continued to slide in and out slowly. "Good girl!" He said even more softly and, as he held me tightly, I felt the warmness of his body against mine. I couldn't breathe. I couldn't move. I just felt. I felt like I was his to do whatever he wanted with. I heard someone gasp as I felt his fingers push into me, his cock slid slowly, and I felt... I felt it happen...</p> <p>I shuddered. I felt a moment...</p> <p>The shock went straight to my core. I felt something else: another feeling. An itch. Another. It started between my legs... and suddenly it was there, too. It spread quickly through my body and seemed to be everywhere at once. It made me shudder and shook me all the more. It made my insides clench, and I felt like I was losing consciousness. I was feeling very strange feelings, but they weren't my normal feelings. I felt... kind of... warm and excited... and wet... and wet... and happy... the feeling came out of nowhere. It was a feeling that scared me. I felt like all of my organs were suddenly on fire. I felt light-headed. I felt dizzy - like I was swimming. It was then that I knew what was happening. I felt him slide out of me, and I felt the liquid drip into the crack of my ass. I felt my ass opening up as he slid out completely - and he didn't stop as he pulled out.</p> <p>"Do you want to suck it," he said, as though I was a child, and I felt my body obey.</p> <p>I wanted it. The feeling was so wonderful, I wanted him to kiss me, to touch me, to make love - to be my lover.</p> <p>His eyes were so dark... theyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
