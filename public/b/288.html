"What's going- on with you?"</p> <p>"That's sort of personal, I guess."</p> <p>He leaned forward and brushed his lips down her neck. "You're like a woman."</p> <p>She pulled back, letting the hair fall to her shoulders. "Yeah, but it's wrong." She moved her mouth to the other side and kissed them, and then on her neck, as her hands reached out to his cock. "And, it has better staying power."</p> <p>"I've got nothing to be ashamed of, I guess."</p> <p>His hand found the softness of her skin again, and ran down to cup her breast. Her nipple was thick and engorged under his palm, and he knew from being around her all day that she was very aroused, the little bump of excitement that was her. He knew he'd never be able to satisfy her with him, but the sight of her naked body in front of him drove him crazy. He moved to capture one of her nipples with his mouth, and sucked gently on it, flicking his tongue over the tip. She moaned softly, and moved her hips so that he was closer to her sex.</p> <p>"You do that so well," he murmured to her. "I always knew that you were a good girl."</p> <p>She closed her eyes and smiled sweetly at him. She reached down, and slowly moved her hand between his legs, where he could feel the growing length of her fingers.</p> <p>"Oh, baby," she teased him, and then, "Let's finish our appetizers in private."</p> <p>He gave a low, almost shy laugh, and she kissed him again. "Not right now, baby. Right now I'm on my knees in front of you," she teased, and led him upstairs.</p> <p>***</p> <p>In a dark room with his head buried in the pillows, he looked up at her. The little bedside lamp gave him a wonderful light shining down on her body.</p> <p>"Hang this in the bathroom," she said quietly as she held up the dress, and they walked back down the stairs together. "Do you mind if I wear it?"</p> <p>The question surprised him. He had dressed down just in case on previous occasions, but this time, wearing it, he wasn't sure it was right, if it suited her. "Sure."</p> <p>She walked into the bathroom, and turned on the light. "Here," she said, as she took the dress for herself.</p> <p>When he stood beside her in the bathroom, she handed him the dress. "Here, let's go for dinner," she said, and they hurriedly changed into their suits.</p> <p>As they were leaving, she said, "Don't go in the bathroom yet, okay?" She paused as if to adjust the mirror, looking toward him.</p> <p>"I think you had best not go before we got there."</p> <p>"That's very nice of you, but if you feel as uncomfortable as I am, I just won't tell you where we're going. I'll be in there all night."</p> <p>"Don't worry. I'll be in there at least as well."</p> <p>As he turned to leave, he added, "Don't forget, I had to wash your suit just a little... in case you weren't ready for me."</p> <p>She turned and smiled at him, then headed to the bedroom. "Thanks," she said, as she closed the bathroom door and turned on the light once more.</p> <p>Outside, they strolled down the beach to a secluded cove, still wearing only their suits.</p> <p>"I don't want to rush the experience," he said. "I want to get to know you better, if you don't mind me asking." He paused for a moment then added with a smile, "You've turned me on, and I'm so excited to know that it didn't seem to matter, that was easy to explain to you."</p> <p>"Thank you," she said. "You look so handsome."</p> <p>"There's no rush," he reassured her. "Maybe we can start somewhere, but I'm sure you'll be happy to be my companion, your companion, and my companion of the future."</p> <p>She walked around him until she met his eyes, and her smile was genuine. "That sounds nice," she said. "I guess I'd like that."</p> <p>He stepped close and brushed a fingertip over her cheek. "You're a very beautiful woman, but I don't believe you would act that way towards me, I'd be terribly jealous."</p> <p>"I don't think I'd be that way with you," she teased.</p> <p>"I'm sure you wouldn't beâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
