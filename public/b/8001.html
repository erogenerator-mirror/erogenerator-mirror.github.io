The woman had turned and bent and was looking to him, smiling, while her fingers toyed with her nipples and pussy. He could see the outline of a cock sticking out of her jeans.</p> <p>"Oh my", was all she could muster. His whole body trembled as he slowly turned to see one of the men. He saw the large bulge in a blue pair of jeans and she was stroking it. There was no doubt his cock was big but at this moment it was very average. The woman turned around again and looked back at him. She smiled and reached up and pulled him to her. She put her arms around his neck and she leaned over, still holding him, and kissed him on the lips.</p> <p>They stood there, not quite sure what to do next as the crowd began to move towards them. He felt the hand on his ass and it began to explore him. It was smooth and light, almost as delicate as a tongue licking or a cock sliding across skin. He felt as if his cock was going to come alive the moment it was in contact with her body.</p> <p>She pulled him to her mouth, pressing him against the wall. She felt the hardness of his cock against her thigh. The stranger behind her leaned in and began to kiss and lick her neck and shoulders and breasts. The other man was pulling her top off and began to work on her nipples as she continued to stroke his cock through his jeans.

She raised her arms to let him take it off as she put her head to the side and moaned softly.</p> <p>The hands continued to caress her breasts as the stranger began to kiss and lick at her legs down her thighs, feeling the smooth skin of her stomach and legs as they were exposed. Her leg was soon on the man's chest and he took her other leg and held it firmly together. He felt her body arch as he licked and sucked her inner thighs as her juices began to flow. He knew that the woman was close by, but he wanted to feel her orgasm on his face as well. It was the most beautiful body he had seen in the flesh. She came like that for a long time, her body shaking and quivering, her entire body shaking in his arms as he licked and sucked her.</p> <p>She was shaking violently as her orgasm subsided. He kissed and kissed her lips. He felt the man behind her on his back and he moved to lie between her. She looked into his eyes as he continued to kiss her, tasting her tears. "What a little slut", he said. "I'm so sorry", she said. He smiled and kissed her and held her as he said those words to herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
