I whispered.</p> <p>'You're very right.' she replied and she kissed me again and then began exploring my chest, taking slow, feathery, light kisses down to my neck to my chest and back up to my mouth.</p> <p>Again she kissed to my body, running her tongue gently across my skin just over my nipples and around them. Then with one hand she held the shaft of my cock and it began to rise.</p> <p>'Just like I told you. Just take your time.' she said. And with her other hand she took my balls into her palm and rubbed them in circles.</p> <p>I moaned as she massaged them firmly and I leaned my back towards her, allowing her to caress my balls more forcefully.</p> <p>'Just keep moving. Just relax and let me do all the work.' she purred.</p> <p>I lay back now totally and totally lost in sensation and she turned her body over so I could kiss her while she continued to massage my balls.</p> <p>I lay back to relax completely, completely aware of her body now with its firm curves and full, luscious breasts.</p> <p>As my senses returned to me, I tried to concentrate on the feel of her body as she continued to kiss me, feeling her heavy sighs which I could feel as she kissed me.</p> <p>'I've been dreaming of doing this with you for days.' she whispered and gently rolled over, positioning herself on the seat of my chair.</p> <p>'I've wanted you for weeks. I love the feel of your skin on mine and even though I know you're not wearing any knickers, I don't want you to feel me.' the words were spoken through the roof of my consciousness now and I felt a sense of confidence as I felt the weight of her body relax beneath me.</p> <p>'So do you enjoy your present?' she asked as she rolled over on top of me.</p> <p>'Of course'. I answered truthfully and with that she rolled over and put her arms round my neck, her lips once again brushed the bare flesh of my chest as her arms encircled my neck and squeezed me and our bodies pressed together as her pelvis ground against me.</p> <p>Now she began to kiss again and moved on top of me, as my dick, with its purple head, slid into her warm, wet pussy. The warmth and wetness of hers on my shaft were like heaven on earth.</p> <p>As her lips brushed my lips, I felt her breathing become faster as she moved her hands over my face, caressing my cheeks and face with her fingers before touching the skin of my cheek. She kissed down around my lips again and she took my mouth in between her hands again, kissing me with a desire that I never thought was possible.</p> <p>I could feel her pussy contracting around me, gripping me and rubbing me harder. I could feel the tight muscles of her pussy squeezing me, gripping me. And then, just to feel them squeezing me again, I tried moving my hips, as it seemed to be driving me to go wild, but then she stopped.</p> <p>'You know you are my present, I'm going to give you a surprise now'. she exclaimed as she pushed me over towards the sofa.'</p> <p>I knew what she was up to now; but I didn't care.</p> <p>She pulled herself up my body, her breasts hanging down and I felt the weight of them on my stomach. It seemed like an age before she lowered herself towards my lap facing me and she took my erection in her soft hands again.</p> <p>'I'm going to use this for what you can't understand,' she said as she positioned herself on top of me. Her breasts were even larger now and I could feel her nipples brushing against my chest as she moved her body up and down on top of me, rubbing herself on me with a circular motion as she squeezed her breasts tightly.</p> <p>'This must feel amazing, this is something I've always wanted to do. I hope you won't be disappointed.' she said and leaned forward to kiss the tip of my penis which had begun to twitch slightly.</p> <p>I loved how she looked in my arms as she kissed me and felt her hair brushing my chest and shoulders.</p> <p>As if in reply I felt a shudder of desire course through me and I could feel the muscles of her stomach and the tightness of her thighs rubbing against my hardness.</p> <p>The feel of her body on top of mine felt wonderful and it made me want to do exactly as she said, to make her come.</p> <p>And then I felt her lips kissing the tip of my cock.</p> <p>I wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
