Your father's not coming over tonight," he said and turned to leave.</p> <p>She followed him quickly. "Wait! I want a cup of coffee!" she shouted as she hurried him. "Let me get my shorts!" She scrambled to find them in his clothes hamper in hopes that the wet spot left by her panties would be nothing more than a small spot. He was just stepping through the door as she hurriedly slipped down to her shorts.</p> <p>"Can't we just skip school and get a cup of coffee and just do it in my apartment?" he questioned, as he grabbed her cup and headed for his car. "I'll be waiting!"</p> <p>After a few minutes of silence he turned to her and whispered, "You're not going anywhere. I'm going to enjoy your company. It's almost as good a deal as the coffee anyway." Before she answered he kissed her softly on the cheek and drove off.</p> <p>It took another moment of hesitation and an unspoken agreement before he turned around and went back to the hotel to get his coffee. She waited as he stood outside the door and peered out, hoping that he would come back for the coffee. They both felt better about the way the situation had developed when they got into their cars and decided that if they wanted to return to school, then it would only be a matter of time before they got a job. After the coffee they talked for a few minutes and when they had finished their coffee, he handed her his cup. She thanked him and then he went inside and went to his car.</p> <p>When she entered her apartment, she walked straight to the bathroom to get clean and changed her top. She looked at herself in the mirror and decided to go for a run around the house. Since the shower was a little over an hour away, she decided to go for a long run. As she ran she thought about the weekend and how they had left her in a situation that made her feel good. As she finished her run, she went back to her room, changed into sweats, and then walked into the shower. Just before stepping out she pulled off her wet shirt and her tank top and stepped under the water with the warm spray. She ran her hands across her wet body as she relished in the feeling. The warm water felt so good on her skin and so good that she just leaned back against the shower wall.</p> <p>As she ran her hands over her breasts she could feel the blood pulsating through her nipples and in the valley of her stomach. She had been with a guy before, but didn't really know what it was like to be a girl. Now that was new. She imagined another experience as she washed her body, feeling them rub against her. Her hands moved down to start teasing her clit and then she stepped out of the shower to rinse off herself.</p> <p>Lying on her bed she felt the sun on her breasts and smiled as she remembered the memory of the experience. It almost felt as if it had been in front of her. She opened her legs just a little knowing that her nipples were still hard and she was still dripping wet. She slowly slipped 2 fingers inside of her vagina and then her middle finger pushed the water out. It was now time for one more test. Just as she wanted she slipped a finger inside her anus and slowly pushed it inside. She then returned to herself with her left hand cupping her right breast. As she caressed her wet fingers over her clit she felt her stomach move. As her body slowly started to shake she imagined it was a stranger's hand inside her. As her orgasm reached its peak she let out a deep sigh as she held her hand in the way of her husband. She had a few things to do today. She grabbed a towel, dried off, and then stepped back into the shower. She wrapped the terry cloth robe around her naked body and tied that at the waist. She then left the room and turned off the light before heading to her bathroom.</p> <p>She removed her robe and stepped into the shower. She had always been a small woman, but that night when she had her first orgasm, she had gotten so much better. She just had to find some place that made her feel like she would never feel. But she felt like a lot of things that she didn't know existed. She remembered those first times of sex, and the joy with which she had experienced. She always wanted this experience to be special even though she knew it was for the wrong reasons. She would have loved to have found a guy with a better opportunity for sex. It would have been a lot of fun to have done that. She imagined the next time they had been in the same car together. She would have done the things she enjoyed doing with others. As she was thinking about what she would do that night.</p> <p>The doorbell rang at 7 a.m. and she hurried to answer itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
