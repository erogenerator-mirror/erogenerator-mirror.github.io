You get me. I get you!"</p> <p>Her mouth was now on his dick. It was a soft kiss. She licked and kissed it like she knew it would always be there. Her lips, tongue and all tasted of him for the first time and she made him feel good. She licked his balls and even his cock for the second time today. One thing she enjoyed very much, when she looked up into his eyes there was just a hint of regret and sadness. She could just sense that he wouldn't be able to take his eyes off of her at all and it wasn't because she was such an idiot. Her lips slowly began to suckle his cock again.</p> <p>"This feels nice."</p> <p>She gave a little extra vibration of her throat and felt the muscles clench on his cock.</p> <p>"Oh fuck. Your dick feels good."</p> <p>"You're so damn fucking good. If it wasn't for the way this feels, I doubt I'd have any balls left."</p> <p>His ass shook as it jerked up against the air in reaction to her tongue on his cock. He knew he was about to come. He could feel his cum starting to run down his thighs. He could tell now as his hands found the perfect place to grab handfuls of her hair and his hips bucked up to take more of his cock into her mouth. His head fell back on the bed as he bucked more and more up against the bed.</p> <p>Her lips and tongue sucked his cock, bringing him back down to the point where he had been before and she felt as though it was a small eternity until it was her turn to orgasm. Finally, he could take it no more.</p> <p>With one last thrust he thrust his cock fully into herself, his cock throbbing in her throat, he exploded and he felt it shoot into her as though he would never stop.</p> <p>"Fuck."</p> <p>Again he felt his cock jerk and then it was gone. He tried to pull his shaft out of her mouth to be part of her, but she shook her head.</p> <p>"Oh no. That's not it."</p> <p>She got off of her back and crawled over to the bed, standing on all fours between his legs. She pulled him by the cock closer to her.</p> <p>"Now why wasn't you wearing panties this morning?"</p> <p>He was still a bit taken aback. He had expected to have her naked in their bed, but with her so close, now he wasn't sure. He never expected to be in the position where she saw him in and she was asking whether he wanted to know what happened for which he was a man of God.</p> <p>"I...I...I have to go. I'll talk to you when you get back," he stumbled.</p> <p>"I just hope you have to," she laughed. "I've missed having you here." She began to crawl away from him and got into the same position and she crawled the rest of the way to him. His face was turned toward the side to see if he needed to look back to see if something was wrong. He did and she began to suck on his cock again. She stroked it and kissed the tip, then took it in her mouth and sucked on it with great passion. The only words uttered in the silence of the evening was</p> <p>"I love you."</p> <p>And then she was gone.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>It was over a night long ago. Her dreams were so vivid she can't even remember which dream but that night she dreamed of her husband and his cock inside her.</p> <p>She woke the next morning to the sound of her daughter's bedroom door opening. The sound wasn't the one she liked hearing in bed, it was one of her favorites. She got up and pulled on a light robe, and went to the front door. She was going to tell her daughter, that she was late, but one look told her he was not with her. She walked to where the light was coming from. She stood outside the door for so long, she knew she still had to open it and let him in. She could feel his dick under her skirt as she moved her fingers toward the door. She pulled gently and the knob came slowly to life.</p> <p>"Hello?" she whispered as she opened the door.</p> <p>"Hi. How you feeling?"</p> <p>Before her answer could escape her mouth the words were out.</p> <p>"Better, yes."</p> <p>She walked toward him, she bent low and kissed him. Their lips barely touched apart. He was so excited that if he had stopped she would have stopped him again and that's what he wasn't looking forward to. But she surprised him too, she leaned against the door for support and leaned her head down as well.</p> <p>"Let me do something for you?" she whispered in his ear.</p> <p>"Hmmmâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
