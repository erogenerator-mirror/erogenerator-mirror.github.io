He was very skilled in the art of giving. The two of them were making me feel like a teenager on the brink of her first time. She reached for his hands and guided him up to rest their foreheads on the side of the bed and his forehead against hers. We kissed gently and sweetly, his arms roaming over my skin. He held me like that for what seemed like forever until it finally ended. The way I wanted him to come inside me was amazing. And when the time came, we were both completely naked, and he was on top of me again.</p> <p>I wanted to feel his hot, hard cock inside me again. So, I took him in my mouth again and teased the tip. There was no way I was going to take that for anything else. The feeling of his cock pressing up against the back of my throat was too much. I began to swallow his hardness and savor the taste and feel of his hardness, and finally, I came again and began to cum again. I felt his cock starting to spurt inside me and my body gave it up as quickly as it could. I don't think I had ever felt a cum-load so intense in my life. I could hear the noise of his cum being squirted into my throat and I held it inside me, as if it was safe to swallow what it could.</p> <p>I looked at him and asked how he was. He grinned and ran his fingers through my hair.</p> <p>"Good work," he said. "Now you're going to learn how to let yourself go."</p> <p>I smiled at him and moved up the bed. He moved around so that he was lying across my body. Without any words, I lowered myself down and felt his cock penetrate my ass. Slowly. I thought about all that had happened since I met him and I began to enjoy the experience. He was a very gentle lover, and his cock was definitely a nice tool to have in my ass. But then he turned and whispered to me how much he loved me, too. I couldn't believe it. I kissed him again and we fell asleep almost immediately. And then we were.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Chapter 12</p> <p>I don't know how we got there but I fell asleep in the big double bed. I felt his fingers and hand begin to caress me again, not to mention his cock. The way it felt in my mouth and the way it felt inside my ass was incredibly erotic. I didn't last long. I think a lot of guys would have done either, but none that didn't last and soon, I was sucking him as hard as he did me, feeling his hand in my hair as it pulled it away from my face.</p> <p>And then I had another idea. I slowly, teasingly, lubed his ass with my finger. First there was the slightest hint of pressure and then it moved back until I found his prostate, his prostate that is. I pressed gently but it had no effect and he sighed. I began to work my finger slowly in and out of him, teasing his ass, preparing to take him back in. But his moans were louder than all of the rest. He took that as permission but more of a signal to continue. I worked harder and deeper until I was completely in him and holding him as tight as I could. I could tell that he was on the brink but didn't want to lose it. He moved a hand down to my pussy and began to move it slowly on my clit but he didn't want to orgasm yet and he didn't try, either. He wanted to make me come in my own bed.</p> <p>Then there were the ones he thought I might like. He was right. He had never given up the idea before but I couldn't believe I ever did. I took the cue and began sucking him again and felt him beginning to move his hips. I kept sucking harder, feeling him get closer to orgasm. So I kept moving my finger in and out and felt myself close up to cumming. So I did, too.</p> <p>Suddenly he moaned as his cum shot into my mouth, flooding it and filling every inch of my mouth. And then he dropped forward so that I could catch some on my tongue. He kissed me, holding me tight for a few moments until I began to regain my senses. I let him kiss me a little longer before I reached for my glass and drank a little of it.</p> <p>We were silent for a while. I don't think either of us felt the need to do anything but kiss. But when I broke, I took him in my arms from underneath and he turned to face me. He didn't rush me. He just took me into his arms and held me as I returned to reality.</p> <p>"Are you ready to go again?" I asked.</p> <p>He didnâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
