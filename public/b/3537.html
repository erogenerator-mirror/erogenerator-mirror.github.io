I told her and she reached down to unzip my pants. She hooked her fingers into the waistband and slowly pulled them down my legs, exposing myself to her as she slid them down my legs and stepped out of them and tossed them to the foot of the bed and then crawled back up beside us with her knees on either side of my legs. She placed one hand on my hip to steady herself as she leaned forward to take me in her mouth and I wrapped my arms around her chest.</p> <p>"Mmmm, that feels so good..." I breathed as she closed her lips around the head, swirling her tongue around my shaft before lifting her head up and sliding down on as I thrust upward to meet her. She moaned around me as my hands slid up her body to cup her breasts, kneading the flesh through the thin fabric of her tee shirt.</p> <p>"Fuck, you're so fucking beautiful..." I whispered into her ear as her tongue danced on the side of my ear.</p> <p>"Mmmmm, I'm going to fuck you later tonight, aren't I?" She teased, her hand sliding down to stroke my length as she teased her way up my thigh then slid along the shaft to graze my balls. I moaned as her fingers slid over her sensitive nub and circled it before sliding back down to tease the head of my cock before she began moving her lips in lazy circles over her cheeks. "I want to feel you," she whispered, her lips sucking firmly over the head of my cock. My hand slid up her body, my fingers sliding down to rest behind her shoulder. I gently pushed her arms towards her head as I pulled her head away from my lap, letting go of her nipple. With a nod of my head, I let go of her arm and she moved her other hand to cup my balls as I slowly withdrew my cock from her mouth.</p> <p>"Mmmmm, I want you... more... like this..." I husked, my hips rocking forward and sliding back against her body with my hands as she pushed herself against me, my cock dragging against her clit as I slid back away from her. I held her close to me and watched as I turned her face to mine and we shared a deep kiss of our own. "Mmmmm, God, you're gorgeous." I finally whispered as we broke our kiss and looked deep into each others eyes.</p> <p>"You're fucking gorgeous..." I breathed into her ear again, before I kissed it again and took her hand as we started slowly backing toward the bed. We both climbed up onto our sides and I took her wrists and began pulling them down toward my hips as I slid forward to align my cock with her wet pussy. She broke the kiss and slid her hands upward until she reached my hips and I slid forward to slide the head of my member into her pussy.</p> <p>"Oh yes, please fuck me..." she begged, her fingers reaching to touch skin as I slowly began to move my hips. "This is going to feel so intense..." she told me before taking my mouth over mine to kiss me deeply before slipping down to press her lips against mine, her tongue meeting mine as she pulled me inside of her. I slid forward, taking more of myself into her as she continued kissing me, her fingers once again caressing my ass. I moaned against her mouth as I slid slowly deeper into her belly before pressing myself harder against her body while she continued her kiss through my lips and teeth. Her hands were on my ass, pulling me in harder as our kissing grew deeper and deeper until finally, I felt myself hit her G-spot. Her body began to jerk against me and I wrapped my arms around her neck to pull her down to meet me as I continued thrusting. "Don't stop," she whispered in my ear as I felt myself tighten beneath her as I exploded inside of her and let her down. My breathing slowed as I felt I was still deep inside of her and it took several minutes for us to come to terms with who we were both, with just the memory of what had just happened. She pulled away from me in a long stroke of our bodies and I rolled to the side as we both caught our breath.</p> <p>We had barely spoken a word to each other as we both fell asleep almost instantly, wrapped up in a blanket and blanket, completely and thoroughly spent.</p> <p>MONDAY</p> <p>I awoke the next morning to my wife getting out of bed wearing a robe and slippers. I stirred slowly as she took the opportunity to slip into the bathroom to take my morning hard-on. She washed her hands and pulled the robe around her while I sat on the side of the bed. "Did I do okay?" she asked with a smile as she sat down next to me. I could feel her nipples pressingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
