He looked over to see Sarah's reaction to the new arrival at the bar. She smiled at him and gave him a knowing glance. He smiled back and returned her smile. We sat and took a sip.</p> <p>He began by saying. "I'd like to introduce a few of my friends. I have seen them around and they all seem like the kind of people that would go for a "get with her" kind of style. We're all in our mid to late thirties and they seem like the people that would be very friendly with you but are a group of people that would be a real bitch if we ever got the chance."</p> <p>His statement stunned me. All of the women at the table were attractive enough and he had not found her ugly back at home. He gave me the finger and I looked at Mike. "Mike... would you talk to Mike? What are you doing here?" I asked.</p> <p>When he started to answer I cut him short of any discussion. "Mike what are the hell are you talking on? I'm just here for a visit to a friend of mine."</p> <p>I looked Sarah in the eye and continued, "Just for a visit. She's here. Not an invite from anyone; this is her. This is her friend Mike. He owns this place.</p> <p>Sarah was shocked. She knew that this was not going to lead to something more, but was shocked that Mike would leave her here. Mike was a little uncomfortable with her and I could see him looking at her as she stared back at him and he was feeling really uncomfortable. "Mike I'm sorry about the way I put it. Please just leave. I didn't mean it. I have had a very bad situation."</p> <p>Mike did not say anything he merely stared at her, which was more than I expected. Before he could say anything, I asked, "Are you going to leave Sarah here and come with me? Or do you want me to come with you?" Mike could hardly speak he just nodded his head in agreement.</p> <p>Mike stood up and walked away and Mike said, "Don't think that I have left you. I really don't. You would be a real shame if you left and went off with your friend."</p> <p>Sarah got up and followed him. I told her that she didn't need to leave. I offered Mike a drink. He got a beer and we sat on the couch talking. Mike told me that he was really worried about Sarah. He said that he thought that if she didn't go with him, that if they got together she would have broken all contact with me and probably run on to him because that was so bad.</p> <p>About this time Jim walked down the stairs and he looked like he was in a daze. He was so nervous as he looked at all of his friends at the bar. He looked like he wanted to get started.</p> <p>He had not had a haircut in awhile. Since it was getting on 12 the man looked like he was going to have it all by the time he had finished his beer.</p> <p>He sat there on the couch and looked over at Sarah. Suddenly she felt really sorry for him and she knew that it could be done. I was wondering why she got up so fast and left to get him. After all I knew that she was not leaving.</p> <p>I turned to Mike and said, "Take her to my room." He just stared at me not saying a word. Slowly he walked over to Sarah and kissed her. She responded by kissing him back and he slid his tongue into her mouth.</p> <p>As the kiss started, I decided to push things forward. "Let's take a few minutes and get out of here." I looked at Mike and asked, "Why are you letting Mike kiss you like that? Please don't think him kissing you because he is a nice guy. I don't think that I will be able to control myself when he kisses me."</p> <p>Mike said, "I don't know. I just don't care; I liked it and I know that she likes it too. We can't do anything like this again."</p> <p>I was thinking that I could really let my self go. But I was also thinking that I had to let things go ahead.</p> <p>Mike turned me and told me that I really did not have a choice. He got up and walked straight to the bedroom. He opened the door and let Sarah in and closed the door.</p> <p>Mike walked over to me and said, "Go lay down on the bed and get over her. When you do I'll meet you out there."</p> <p>I thought that I had made a big mistake and was going to have to apologize for making such a move on me. But I did it by standing and walking over toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
