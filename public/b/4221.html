She asked back.</p> <p>"What? I had no idea." I said back.</p> <p>"But you are so wet. Don't you ever go to such places again?" He teased me.</p> <p>I thought of the time he fucked me in the park after we got home early. When you are so wet, but you like it. I knew he was getting close, I guess I was too.</p> <p>"I never," I answered.</p> <p>He smiled and then went back to rubbing my clit with his fingers. I knew my pussy was soaking my panties. I wanted his cock so badly. My body was starting to convulse. I knew what was coming.</p> <p>"I have to have you," I said. I grabbed his leg and pulled it closer to me. He knew how badly I wanted his cock. He knew I wanted him now.</p> <p>His mouth was back at my pussy, his finger went in further. I know he was so fucking good at it. I was his now and I wanted it to be with him. I wanted it very much.</p> <p>He was going to cum. He started to push into me more. I loved it. I loved it. It felt so fucking good. I knew it was going to be good for both of us.</p> <p>I felt his cock twitch inside me. I heard his groan as he came, hard. I had never done anything this good, really. I loved it.</p> <p>He slid out of me and sat back on his heels. I felt his cum all over me and I didn't care. After he started to pull his pants back up I looked at his cock and saw a small drop of cum. God I loved his cum all over me. I pulled my clothes on when he stood up and looked around.</p> <p>"Why did you stop?" I asked him. "I was so close."</p> <p>"Well I was getting pretty turned on by that. I would never have been able to last too long." He smiled.</p> <p>"I know. I am glad you decided to do what you did." I said. That was the first words his lips had been. "What do you like best about your cock?" I asked as he sat there staring at his hand on his still hard cock.</p> <p>"You did it all afternoon, sweetheart." He chuckled. It was one of the things I loved most about him, to be able to say that just when it got hard. Especially on a first date with a guy I wanted him to be with all the time. I always wanted him to be on the verge of fucking the shit out of me, he was so talented. If he did that, my pussy wouldn't really be on the verge of cumming. We were going to have to take care of that, right the fuck now.</p> <p>We sat there for a minute catching our breath. I love seeing him happy, especially when he knows that it is my pleasure that is the pleasure that he wants. I think that he just loved to show me that he wasn't going to be able to last so long. I leaned back and put my arms over my head trying to feel his cum on my body. I really needed that.</p> <p>"I never thought you were into the real idea of oral sex." I smiled up at him.</p> <p>"I guess I'm into the idea of the real thing." He replied.</p> <p>I took his hand and put it on my neck before I put my lips on it. He kissed my lips softly and then started to slide his tongue in and around them. I moaned as he took my body to new heights. I wanted him to have that pleasure.</p> <p>"God" I said to him as he slid off the couch. "I have never been on the edge like that. You are the best cock I have ever had." He nodded his head in agreement.</p> <p>"Let's start with some kissing. I can't wait till we get there." I said as I lay on my back next to him. I could feel his hands at my pussy. He could feel the wetness leaking down my leg and that my pussy needed his cock so badly. I could tell that was turning him on even more. He kissed me all over my lips and then started kissing my face and neck. He sucked on my cheek before he stuck his tongue in my ear.</p> <p>"You taste so good, little girl. I could spend hours in there." He said as his hands went back to my pussy. That was the part as I moaned as one of his fingers started to circle my clit. He looked into my eyes as I kissed him all the way down his chin. I could feel him starting to go for it, not at all gently.
