I'm not as large as he is with a little more weight than he makes out. But there really is something about seeing a girl and her body that is all I'll ever want to do. He was kissing me and fondling my breasts and I was loving it.</p> <p>We finished up in the shower, and as promised we dried off and laid in bed. The next night was even better, we got to spend as much time together as we wanted. But the day that I was at the party I was in a much better mood than I thought I was. He was more the gentleman than the flirtation.</p> <p>We kissed and fondled some more, and when we were ready to go outside he asked me to hold on while he went to the truck to take me home.</p> <p>"Why don't you stay with me tonight?"</p> <p>"Sure, lets!"</p> <p>While he was driving, and I was hanging out with him I played with his cock. All I could think of was how it was already poking out of his trunks and how it felt in my hand. It didn't take long before he was shooting a nice load into the air and all over my towel. I took it and held it up for him to see as he looked in awe, then held the rest in my hand and got dressed. As I walked him to his house and got out my suit and walked back in my heels.</p> <p>"I can't believe you did that, I just felt so sexy that I just wanted to give you the thrill of you being in the club."</p> <p>He just smiled in return, and we walked in and I dropped into something he called his "the closet." He led me over to it, and we sat down.</p> <p>"I think we can afford to spend a little more tonight, I'm sure I can find another way in if you want."</p> <p>"Oh, you know something else, what would you like? A private place to fuck? A room to fuck on!"</p> <p>We laughed and played around for a while. Then he suggested we go up to his room as long as we wanted. Not wanting to waste his time I said, "Ok, sure!"</p> <p>Once we got to the room we undressed and he stood in front of me, and started taking off his clothes and taking his socks off. I just stood in front of this gorgeous man and waited for the opportunity to come back into my life.</p> <p>"Get in here, we need to do this!" he ordered.</p> <p>I climbed on the bed and he started undressing. He removed my clothes first and threw them to the side of the bed. He climbed on top of me and started kissing my nipples.</p> <p>"I can still smell you on me!" he said.</p> <p>My cock was already standing up again, and I could feel it pressing against his stomach. He rolled over onto his back and got me close to him. He grabbed the head of my cock and started licking all around the head.</p> <p>"Mmmmm your pussy tastes amazing," he moaned.</p> <p>He took a little bit more of my meat inside of him, and started moving up slightly. My hands went to his back and my finger went to his shoulder. I took his hand and placed it on top of my cock.</p> <p>He looked me in the eye and said, "I could kiss this whole thing now!"</p> <p>With that he leaned forward and put his lips to mine, and I opened my mouth to take his tongue inside. He started moving with me now, and just had to kiss again. When he got our hips moving again I was sure I could hear the sound of his cock going in and out of his mouth. We were making out for several minutes, until he finally stopped and asked, "Would you like to fuck me?"</p> <p>"God, yes!"</p> <p>He got on his side, and we both got onto our hands and knees and started kissing again. I could feel his cock getting wetter as it moved in and out, and I put my fingers to my hole and pushed the head of my cock along the lips of his mouth. His tongue danced with mine as he put his lips to the top of his erection and licked it slowly. He put his hands to my hips where he started fucking me then.</p> <p>"I could do this forever," he moaned.</p> <p>He grabbed my hips real hard and I knew that I wasn't going to last long. His cock felt amazing inside of me, his mouth felt amazing on mine. After many minutes he asked, "Are you okay?"</p> <p>"Yes!" I said.</p> <p>"What do you wantâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
