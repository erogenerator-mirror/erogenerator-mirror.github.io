She took off her shoes and pulled off her skirt and panties, and he lifted it off and off herself. Her naked body had a slight tan, but it was long and perfectly rounded and tight. She sat on his lap naked and began running her tongue over his lips as she lowered herself on top of him, and then up, and down, letting him thrust in and out of her. She stopped moving and kissed him again, and began to slide up his body. She rubbed herself all over him, and then sat facing him. She pushed her tits together as she rubbed them against his chest and her nipples ran back and forth and over his chest hair.</p> <p>"You made me wet again just thinking about fucking you," she whispered.</p> <p>"I'm glad of your wetness now that you're sitting facing that way, and not just me," he said.</p> <p>"I knew it would get you," she said.</p> <p>"And it was so good how you kept me in the dark.

"And it looks good too," she said as she ran her tongue all over his balls, then back and forth across his shaft, and down again to his balls before she licked his cock again.</p> <p>He looked at her sitting there rubbing herself on the shower floor and knew he wanted to fuck her again. But he wanted more than that. He got out of the shower and wrapped his towel around his waist, and he walked to the bedroom door. "Okay?"</p> <p>"Okay," she said in a soft voice.
