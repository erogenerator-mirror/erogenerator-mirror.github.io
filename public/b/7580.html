By the time she got to the bottom of the stairs, she had her eyes closed as she entered the darkened house.</p> <p>He had told her to go up to bed, when she heard the bedroom door open. She looked around, and saw that he was still in bed, lying on his side, with one leg slightly touching hers.</p> <p>“What the hell are you doing?” She had shouted. He was so handsome, it had been years, but there was no way she could let him continue with this much of an affair.</p> <p>He slowly stirred, still lying on top of her, and raised his head up to look at her. She turned to look at him again, and saw his eyes, glowing, as they always have. She smiled and then reached up to gently caress his face. "Oh, my love." It was definitely a sweet, sweet, romantic kiss.</p> <p>Slowly his hand slid down over her ribs, then up to cup her breast, and she felt as if she had just come. The touch of his fingertips on her nipples, made her body move involuntarily, and she had an instant urge to reach down and grab him, but she held back, not trusting herself to reach down and caress anything that had to be her. She had always believed that sex was for fucking, not for making love. This would be different.</p> <p>"Oh-h-h." Her voice had grown deeper, and she could see in his eyes that he still liked it when she touched him, as if he approved.</p> <p>They continued kissing. His hands were caressing her body all over, one hand sliding over her belly, his fingers tracing around her clit. She opened her eyes, and found his gaze on her, but more than that, more her eyes, he was an intense, deeply beautiful man. Suddenly the thought and desire that had been haunting her all day swept over her. She had been his first, and here they were kissing her best friend, sharing a kiss that promised so much more than just a kiss, and he was her first. Her hands flew up to caress him, feeling every little curve, every little vein, every hair, every hair.</p> <p>She could feel him slide down her body, to the bed, as he reached up under her arms, and her hands went immediately to his hard, muscular body. One hand slipped down to the base of his cock, rubbing the hard swollen head, looking up at her, as her mouth closed over it once again.</p> <p>She didn’t know what to do, and she almost lost it the first time she saw it. But her eyes still had something else to do. She reached up, and tentatively licked the head of his cock. It was almost as hard as the one she had inside her mouth. He shuddered and she slowly took him into her mouth as far as she could, still not believing that anything this hard could slide so easily down her throat.</p> <p>She felt his body shuddering once again, as she took him deep. As always he loved to move within her, and in her mouth, feeling her wet heat envelop him. She sucked slowly, feeling him slide in deeper, deeper, and it took all of her self control not to move her head back and forth, wanting to feel the feeling of him inside her. But she knew she was lost.</p> <p>"Shush,” he said softly. “I'll move down here."</p> <p>She looked up into his gaze and saw that his eyes were now dark with lust as he whispered "Turn over,”, and she immediately turned around, facing away from him. He spread his legs, and she could see how hard he was. She wanted to feel him, wanted to touch him, knew that she could never be that bold, but couldn’t wait, because she knew she would do the same, because that she would never do that again. She raised her hands, and wrapped them around his waist, pulling him to her. They kissed deeply as he slid in to her. She gasped as his hardness slid into her, and felt his hardness, so she slowly rocked against him, working her hips with him.</p> <p>He broke the kiss, grabbed her hips, and slowly began to fuck her ass, feeling the heat, the wetness, and the heat from her pussy as she moved against his hardness. She could feel the movement begin, feeling his shaft slide ever deeper into her. He reached up and untied the tie on the cuffs, pulling them from around her wrists. He slowly began to move—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
