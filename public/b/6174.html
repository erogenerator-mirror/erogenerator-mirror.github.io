The shirt is ripped at the shoulder and the sleeves are loose at the elbow. I shake my ass in your face. "I can't be the first guy to see you naked," I say teasingly. Then I move up to kiss you as I look down at your chest. "I won't break a promise I made," I say, pressing my ass into your stiff cock.</p> <p>You kiss me and move down to my neck. I feel your hot breath on my skin. I am glad you have a soft one. "What about you?"</p> <p>You kiss my collar bone, taking a small bite. Then you kiss down my neck and you kiss the top of my breasts as though it is skin to skin. I moan and move my head from side to side. "No, no, don't stop," I beg.</p> <p>Your mouth leaves a trail of fire in its wake as you move back up to my neck, sucking and nibbling. You continue down my chest, kissing my belly and moving slowly to the top of the shirt. You slowly pull the shirt up and I let it float off me. Then you kiss the underside of my tits and work your way up to circle my nipples with your tongue. God, you are good.</p> <p>Your hands move to the bottom of my bra, squeezing my ass and stroking your fingers up and down my ass. "Not here," I gasp. I pull you back up and wrap my leg over yours. I can feel your stiff cock against my thigh. I want to feel you inside me.</p> <p>"What's wrong?" you ask.</p> <p>I wrap my arms around you, holding you tight. "Nothing, I just want to have sex with you." I slide my hand down your stomach and under the towel and onto your cock. I gently stroke you as your fingers brush against my pussy. "What if your cousin comes over?"</p> <p>"Let him, they can wait in the other room."</p> <p>"How long?" I ask.</p> <p>You look at me and smile. "Ten minutes." Then you kiss me gently and go to the other room.</p> <p>I lay there for a while, catching my breath, then I look at the clock. It is 6:35am. We have only about an hour before I need to be ready to go. I have got to go soon. "We can talk about it when you get dressed," I whisper. I go up to my room, put the robe I have on over my swimsuit and wait. My body is beginning to tingle, I can't believe I just let my husband see me naked. I go into the bathroom and brush out my hair.</p> <p>The doorbell rings and I jump, but I try to get it out quickly enough. So, I put on a robe and jump in the shower. I feel a bit embarrassed but happy as I hear him walk into his bedroom. "Yes?" I ask him.</p> <p>"Hey," he says. "Would you like something to eat?"</p> <p>"No, I don't think I can eat for another ten minutes," I reply, standing with my back to him.</p> <p>"Well, why don't you just go over to her house, and I'll get a pizza?" He kisses me on the cheek then walks around to the door. The door is closed and I get the pizza in the car. Then I turn to face him, still on the sidewalk, I let my robe fall open a bit and reach down to the crotch of my swimsuit. My hand travels to my pussy and I lift it a bit so that he can see the moisture on my lips. I move the lips around my middle finger and smile.</p> <p>"Are you ready?" he asks.</p> <p>"God, yes." I let my robe fall open and step out of it. "Will you come over to her house so I don't have to go back?"</p> <p>"Of course, why not?"</p> <p>He pulls his t-shirt down and stands in the doorway of his bedroom. He looks me over and I am not sure if it is more anticipation of what is to come and maybe for me to get used to his cock sliding in and out of me or if this is to stop for my sex life. I smile.</p> <p>"Let me get my robe," I say, going back to his bed. Then I lay down under the covers. The bed is too soft, although he does offer it frequently for me to lay on.</p> <p>Fifteen minutes later, I slip under the covers completely naked and curl up next to him. I move the covers away. "I like what I see," I say. "I'm not sure, is there anyone you could be interested in? It's not that I don't want to, but I thinkâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
