She gave me a wry smile and stood up in front of me. "Let's do this. I'm ready."</p> <p>A little earlier I'd made it very clear that this was going to be just the beginning of a fantastic evening. I wanted to please her so fucking badly that I'd let anything else please her. Now I'd want to fuck her and please her with everything I had. If this was going to go far I didn't care if the night was ending before I even touched her. She was right. It was time.</p> <p>I took my pants and briefs off and let my cock spring forward, proud of the head. She stepped out of her own panties and spread her legs over mine. I positioned my cock at the entrance to her wet pussy and pushed my cock inside her with no further ceremony. Her juices were flowing as well as I fucked her and I realized I could almost go on like this all night.</p> <p>She closed her eyes and rolled her head back. She was so aroused. Her breathing became shorter and her body began to shake. Her hips began to move with me but I stopped as her pussy clamped tightly down on my cock. When she stopped moving her hips started to move up again and I felt her juices trickling down the inside of her legs.</p> <p>She collapsed forward on mine. We were both totally spent. When she pulled her legs open again, I noticed her pussy hair was wet. It was like she'd just had a bath and she looked sexy just like that. This time was a different kind of sex. It was as if she'd just fucked me with her eyes as I felt her. She opened her eyes and looked up at me.</p> <p>"Well?"</p> <p>"Yes I know what we can do," I said, still buried inside her.</p> <p>"What do you think?"</p> <p>I felt her grip my cock as she slowly pulled it through her pussy lips again. She pulled me back to her and kissed me lightly and said, "I think the two of us could do the deed. The thought of you just being here with me was like a thousand new memories. All those times I saw you naked in my arms and you even looked like you were naked right now, you were so beautiful."</p> <p>Her eyes had a mischievous look to them and she asked, "Do you see now that maybe if we do this one time I'm going to have to give you what you think you would like?"</p> <p>"Oh God," I moaned. "I think I can make love with you anytime," I said.</p> <p>She smiled and wrapped her arms around me once more, drawing me down on her. This time I felt her pussy tighten around my cock as she brought me back to earth. The feeling of her pussy clenching on my cock was incredible and I felt myself slowly beginning to respond to her. She broke the kiss and said a little more seriously, "I think we should try something. If you want this to work, I think I believe the way I feel about this thing. I believe in our relationship and I sure as hell know that I want to have sex with you. I was going to make it happen but now you've brought something you never had or didn't think you could."</p> <p>"Well, maybe I should. What will it be?" I asked her. I could feel the head of my cock starting to pulse inside her. She laughed, "There's a big difference."</p> <p>She lifted her hands to my chest. "Let me take over," she said. I let her do it and soon felt the first surge building up inside me. "That's it," she said. "Take it out right from my pussy."</p> <p>I could feel the veins in my cock getting thicker as my cock throbbed in her. The first pulse left me and she held my cock to herself as another one surged past.</p> <p>"I'm a little sore," she said. "Maybe some kind of massage would do you good." She pulled me into a kiss and let the fire go from my eyes and up through my chest to my cheeks. She slowly lowered me back until my whole body was back on the bed. Slowly she sat herself up and looked at me.</p> <p>"I think... maybe you just want me to do something you've always wanted," she said. I didn't say anything. Then she leaned forward, still holding me to her, and began to move her body against mine. I felt the heat of her body as she moved back and forth against me. I could feel both her hands on the inside of my thighs and her hard nipples pressing into my ribs. If something really big had to be done it would have to be something as sexy as this.</p> <p>Her handsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
