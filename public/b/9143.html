Thanks for coming.</p> <p>"See you tomorrow."</p> <p>"See you tomorrow.</p> <p>"Bye," I replied.</p> <p>"Bye," she called as she hung up the phone.</p> <p>I was just getting up, when I heard a sound, from the other end of the phone.</p> <p>"Mr. Moore"</p> <p>My heart raced as I listened to the voice just two feet away.</p> <p>"Is that you?"</p> <p>"Yes!</p> <p>"Do you want to come over?"</p> <p>"I...I guess.</p> <p>"There's always a phone," I replied.</p> <p>"Well, then I'll come to yours."</p> <p>She was there. She hung up and I could hear her talking to him, with the accent. It was very sexy.</p> <p>"Mr. Moore.</p> <p>"Yes," I replied.</p> <p>"Where is there?</p> <p>"I came home early," I replied.</p> <p>"You're sure?"</p> <p>"Yep.</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Positive.</p> <p>"Is there a problem?"</p> <p>She laughed.</p> <p>"No, I'm not at work. I'm going home."</p> <p>I could hear her get up and leave the room.</p> <p>"Well I guess...I'm not quite ready to go yet."</p> <p>"Well, come over tonight."</p> <p>I was so hard thinking of her, that I could almost start getting turned on.</p> <p>"But, I don't feel... I'm not ready to...to do anything."</p> <p>She got me. There was no way at that point that she could have possibly let it go any further.</p> <p>"Okay," I replied.</p> <p>I could hear her walking away, but she wasn't quite there.</p> <p>Just as I was about to say something, she called out goodbye.</p> <p>"You can wait in the back."</p> <p>"Thank you."</p> <p>I was about to get up on that stage when she came in. I waited a few moments for her to leave.</p> <p>"Goodnight," she said.</p> <p>"Good night," I replied.</p> <p>I listened in on her phone conversation as I finished my beer.</p> <p>"That's you," she said. "Do you want to come over tonight?</p> <p>I thought that if she said yes, it might just be the perfect time to get home.</p> <p>"Of course."</p> <p>"How about I go up to your place around nine-thirty?"</p> <p>I looked at her for a minute. I had never been on a date, but there was always a possibility that I might be able to get a quick fuck. I had been with a girl once in college, but nothing else. But there was always an element of danger. There was always something in my mind.</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"Great. I'll be by around ten."</p> <p>"See you then."</p> <p>"Bye."</p> <p>Once I hung up the phone, I was thinking about how sexy she was. And now I was getting hard.</p> <p>The way she carried herself was just that.</p> <p>And she was definitely beautiful. She was tall and pretty, had long hair and was wearing a short black skirt. I could almost see the tops of her breasts. And her tits were large. She didn't seem to have big tits, but there was just something about her. She turned and looked over at me as she walked by, giving me a little glance.</p> <p>"You know," she said, "I haven't had sex in a long time."</p> <p>That was a lot to make up for. She was probably just as turned on as I was right now.</p> <p>We talked a little more about our day as my mind raced through my fantasies of hers.</p> <p>We talked about how we could make each other happy. That was always a huge part of our sex life. We were usually having a good time.</p> <p>And when it came time for her to leave her panties on, I wasn't sure if it was because it was hot or if she was trying to get the smell of sex out of my nose.</p> <p>After several minutes of talking, sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
