"And don't worry you will be out of it before either one of us gets a shower." The blond smiled at her. "And who knows who will be around at that time. The other night was really good but if we can get them to come back here by tomorrow..." She smiled. "I'll take a shower first then we'll sit around the pool and drink a beer or take the next round out." With a shake Lena pulled Kyle into the pool. "If we can't all get a shower together after that workout we'll just swim a little later." Kyle didn't see the smile in her eye though as he was going into the pool to swim.</p> <p>"Oh, and don't forget your underwear, those too." Both girls laughed as the blond was pulling on the swimsuit.</p> <p>"Yeah, I forgot, my panties too." She looked at both of them for a moment and saw that their eyes were wide with shock. She blushed and looked around until she spotted her parents. She shook her head as she picked up her blouse, sliding it on and looked back over her shoulder. "Thanks Daddy, I'll meet you later. Don't forget to tell them to bring any more swimming suits, even if they do decide to buy them." She held out her hand and saw Kyle shaking his head. "Don't worry, you got your chance to get home, no harm no foul." She laughed and tossed her keys to Kyle while walking out the door.</p> <p>"She's getting a hug from her Dad already." Lena thought. "I suppose they must have already realized that their daughter knew they were going to be going to that movie the other night though? I guess that he must have figured something out in the evening though." She laughed as she walked out the door.</p> <p>"So do you two talk often?" Lena asked Kyle as he pulled up in the drive.</p> <p>Kyle nodded. "Of course I do, so have a good time! The weather is so wonderful over here, I'll catch a cold or something."</p> <p>"Thanks Kyle!" Lena said as she walked up the stairs to her room. She stopped to turn the key in the door. "Hey!"</p> <p>"Hey sweetie, what's up?" Kyle asked from behind her as she walked into the room.</p> <p>"I can't believe I told my parents I'm leaving in the morning, just to leave my boyfriend behind!" He grinned at her. "Yeah, probably, but I'll talk to him later, ok?" She hugged him tightly. "I love you baby, happy birthday." She kissed him quickly on the cheek and moved to the door.</p> <p>"Merry Birthday Kyle!" Lena said, pulling him out of the room with her after they had gotten into the car. Lena and Kyle had known they would probably be going to the movies that night but they decided to surprise them. It was also going to be a birthday treat for them. They just hadn't had the chance to enjoy the evening alone during the trip so they knew it would be all a day of anticipation. Lena had called her parents on her cell phone before they left and talked for a short time. She also talked to her Aunt Karen and Uncle Steve about how it had been going with Kyle and what she and Kyle had planned. Lena's mother told her that they had only stopped to take a shower and get dinner ready. That meant that Kyle and Lena should get up in the morning and then come down for dinner. Lena's mother had also told her that she shouldn't have worried about Kyle being too nervous if he did his best to show off his talent.</p> <p>Kyle watched Kyle's parents leave and grinned as he saw Lena sitting on the bed reading. It would be so warm in here after the flight to Atlanta. She was wearing a yellow sundress with blue flowers and pink flowers all over it. Her long brown hair hung down around her face a beautiful contrast in her pale skin. He saw his mother lean over and look at him. Lena's eyes were bright and friendly and he watched as she raised her hand to his hand, tracing it up and down from his thumb to the middle finger. Kyle nodded and leaned over and kissed her hand again.</p> <p>He heard the shower turn on so he stood up and walked towards the bathroom. "You really have to shower again I'm starving." Kyle called out loud.</p> <p>He had just stepped into the bathroom when he felt Lena behind him. He tried to turn around without falling over, but she had him pinned against the wall. He couldn't reach and his hands were trapped by her breasts. He groaned and pushed back against her, not sure if he was going to get away or just get away. She was right, he wanted to get away, he was sure.</p> <p>Lena stepped away and smiled. "Well, it's been so long, we should get started!" She laughedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
