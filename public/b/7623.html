His fantasies would be far less intense than hers, but it was definitely a possibility, if he wasn't too far gone in his lustful life. He was just about in shock, because he had never considered himself a lesbian, so it was as gay as he thought. However after reading the message on his email that morning, he decided that if he only knew the woman he would fall in love with.</p> <p>But, even as they planned their honeymoon, the feelings that she felt now were more sexual than he had ever imagined, and when he realized how much he loved her, he never hesitated to say 'Yes'.</p> <p>Her husband was going to go insane with jealousy, at the moment of their love for each other, and she wouldn't be able to stand up if she didn't share it with him. However he didn't know that he would ever be able to give it to her, with her knowing that he was aching to feel her naked body next to his as he made love to her.</p> <p>His body was in control; he didn't have to ask her permission to touch her; she would have to decide if she wanted to stay or not.</p> <p>He knew that if he asked her permission to cum, she would let him, and she would not mind him making her cum.</p> <p>So, they set a date and time for his wedding the following week.</p> <p>That night, he was so excited to experience the feeling of her naked body next to him.</p> <p>He lay quietly in the dark and thought about her beautiful face, her mouth and her soft curves; he was so hard and ready for her, to put into her, but to never think about being able to have sex, not even with her.</p> <p>His mind went crazy wondering what it would feel like to have her there, touching her in the same way that he was touching her now.</p> <p>She had never allowed herself to be used by another man before, and didn't know it would feel so good.</p> <p>He had a raging hard on so hard, it was aching.</p> <p>He reached down between his legs and began stroking his cock.</p> <p>It didn't take long for him to go off and cum, thinking of his wife being at a distance being able to hear him and look in on him and the other woman.</p> <p>He pictured all the fun he would have doing that same thing once that same woman would be in his bed again.</p> <p>He couldn't believe he could possibly be doing that!</p> <p>He imagined one evening, as he lay with his legs wide apart, her naked body next to his and the others naked.</p> <p>He thought of feeling her face next to his head as he sucked on her breasts and would like to kiss her neck, and let her caress his arms, and his thighs. Her body was so inviting, and when she had a breast in her mouth he would do anything she wanted. He couldn't hold back any longer because he needed to hear her voice; he hadn't given it to her for a long time and this could be the best thing that she would do for him.</p> <p>It was a long, difficult decision, but he still loved her, but felt strongly that they could never be together, in any way.</p> <p>She felt the same way too, they had been together too long, it was the best sex for both of them, the only thing that would make her happy.</p> <p>They finally decided that it was more than them. It was her idea, and if she could give him such a chance, she would give it to him as well. If he couldn't have her he would have no choice but to be with her. But now, he knew that whatever she had to do, she had to do it for him.</p> <p>He felt her hand come over and caress his balls and thighs as she was now standing next to him, and slowly moving her body up and down. Her hot breathe made the head of his cock start to tingle.</p> <p>He was now so excited that when his mind was all turned towards her, he didn't care if the woman he was lusting over was a woman, or a girl. After all, his wife was his wife, and his lust for her would be the same for him. He didn't care that his wife might be a girl, and he didn't care that he would be having sex with other men as well, and so long as she was with him.
