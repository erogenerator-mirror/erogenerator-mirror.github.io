She said, feeling her pussy twitch as his lips slipped over hers, sucking her lips into his own, pressing against them. "I've been waiting for this since I first saw you in the bar." They were soon locked in a kiss, with his arms wrapped around her and their bodies pressed into each other. "I'm really glad we met then, babe." She broke free of his embrace and stepped back. "And I'm very glad I met you." She ran a hand down her own body, her fingers sliding up over the fabric of her shirt, causing goose bumps to rise on her arms.</p> <p>"Well, don't waste all that time trying to start small," he said with a grin. "Besides, it's not like you haven't been waiting for it either." He reached up, unbuttoning her blouse and pulling it open, pushing the lace off over her arms, tossing it on the couch.</p> <p>"God, you're so fuckin' hot," he said. He let her slip from his arms and slid his own shirt off, tossing it on to the other couch. "Not just sexy, but super hot," she grinned, feeling her body shudder as his large hands took firm hold of her left breast. Her eyes closed in response, sliding her hands over his shoulders, her fingers catching his t-shirt collar, causing his skin to move against hers. He slid her shirt off, tossing it on the end. With a smile, he reached back and undid his pants, sliding them down to his knees and shucking them to the ground. "Hurry up, girl," he said with an assuring grin. "I can't wait to be inside." She smiled back, pushing her body back to him, her hands moving up and down his chest, taking in his muscles and his skin underneath. He reached around her body again, wrapping his hands around her waist and pulling her back toward his face. She slid her hands up the inside of his legs, following his hands with hers, and her body shifted against his, giving him plenty of room to get in more easily. He kissed her lips, pressing his hips against hers. As much as she liked the sensation of his hands on her body, this situation was one of the few situations in her living room where she felt like she was on display. Now that she had done something, she wanted to be free on the outside. She wanted to be on display.</p> <p>"Just go slow," she said. "This isn't gonna be quick, is it?"</p> <p>"Definitely not," he said with a smile. His arms moved over either side of her, his hands sliding up and down her back.</p> <p>"What if I wanted faster?" she asked, feeling as if she knew the answer by now.</p> <p>"I don't know, maybe you're right," he answered without hesitation."</p> <p>"So just go in, ok?"</p> <p>"Okay," he said, then reached up and cupped one of her breasts, pulling on the nipple, causing her to back up a little and moan. "It's a good match. You're a better fuck than me. I'm a better fuck than you." He gave her nipple a playful pull.</p> <p>"You just keep this up," she said without moving her body, "and I'll come to you later," she smiled weakly, then closed the front door. "I have a whole bunch of things I need to do tonight so I can get this thing over with and get back to the real fun that I'd hoped we would have."</p> <p>"Good girl," he smiled, feeling a rush of pride. She needed that more than he did. "Then, we can do this thing. Let's do this, then go home."</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>I hope you enjoyed the story as much as I enjoyed writing it.
