The elevator began to slow down as we made it into the parking lot, but we finally got to the elevators in what looked like no time at all.</p> <p>When we got to the ground floor of the building, it took us no more than ten minutes before the doors opened into a lobby with two doors leading to the front entrance. On the other side of the room was a staircase to the upper floors. We made our way down the long hallway until we reached our destination. The elevator came to a halt, and we saw a row of doors on either side of the door, that were the doors from the elevator's parking lot. We opened the door, and in front of us was a suite apartment. As soon as we got in, our clothes started slipping off of us.</p> <p>"Is that your room?" I asked, not having that idea for quite a while.</p> <p>"Yeah," was her one word reply.</p> <p>She reached over and pulled me onto her lap. I grabbed her hands and quickly pulled them from my back. I pulled them off her, and turned to face her. I sat down on the couch and pulled her in toward me, and our lips met in a long, passionate kiss. Our hands, both inside her shirt, went for those perfect breasts. They were a perfect amount of 36c, but they still stood proudly on her chest, and when I squeezed her nipples, she moaned. She let me pull her closer to me and our kiss intensified.</p> <p>I broke the contact for a second, but before I could ask her to stop, she told me that we must go to her room now and that there would be no more "quickies."</p> <p>I nodded my agreement.</p> <p>"What do you have in mind for later that I will probably have to wear a skirt in the living room where we will all be able to see each other," she said.</p> <p>I nodded in agreement also, and followed her to the front door. I turned right to go around the house. I was still surprised that we had been so out of reach for so long. As I turned, I felt her lips leave mine and she put her hand on my thigh. The thought, I found, that her hand was no longer in my pants. I was so turned on I felt my cock press against her stomach as our lips parted. I looked directly into her eyes, and she smiled, and then I took her hand and led her out through the front door.</p> <p>She was standing where we had sat when I saw it. My friend, Dave had told me where it was and that in it's place she was to keep the lights on when she was ready. I looked directly to it because, I knew, her eyes would be drawn to the door. I was to wait outside until she could go down there, and I would not hear a sound.</p> <p>She walked across the living room, and, with an open palm, knocked the door. She turned and opened the door for me. My heart raced as she entered, my eyes locked on her ass, which was moving rhythmically in a small jiggling motion as she walked down the hallway to her room.</p> <p>I closed the door and walked back to the couch. The excitement was driving me crazy; I was trying to resist the feelings that were welling up inside of me. I looked at the door and was surprised that it was open just a tiny bit. There in the middle of the hallway, where all four walls of the room were covered with a light switch, was a room that appeared to be the living room.</p> <p>The lights were on, so my face and mind did not need the visual onslaught, but I could make out the door. She came over at the end of the hallway.</p> <p>"You're here, right?" she asked as she approached the door.</p> <p>"Yes," I replied.</p> <p>"I'm naked," she said, pulling on the cord between her wrists and her arms holding them. She pulled her arms down and stood there in front of me. Her hand went out and she reached for the button to her jeans. She slid the zipper back, and pulled the black and blue striped button down. She pulled out the button and buttoned off the garment leaving on the left side of her legs and panties. She took the zipper and zipper back and pulled it back to reveal her pussy, which stood naked before me. Her bush was dark brown and full, and I wanted to bury my face in that bush because, as far as I could see, nothing was covering her pussy.</p> <p>She stepped forward, took my hands in her hands, and opened the doorâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
