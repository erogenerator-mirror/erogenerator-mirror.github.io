Leaning back against the mirror, the two looked at each other and smiled. "There's a shower in there you could use. I'll just go in and change," she said, sliding out his lap. Standing, she grabbed the waist band of her thong, pulled it down and stepped out of it, and stepped back into the bathroom.</p> <p>Alyssa slipped under the shower, adjusting the water temp before slipping them both into the bath. She stepped into the warm spray, and was amazed by its heat. Her skin was a rich shade of red, which she never felt before. She rubbed the soap into her skin and lathered her legs. A few passes of her body, she was soon washing her hair. She finished with her legs shortly and stood, turning to face her friend.</p> <p>"So, Greg, how does your shower taste?" she asked. He stepped into the tub, and she could immediately tell that the water was beginning to burn.</p> <p>She turned the shower jets off and closed the door. "The water's really nice, I feel calmer," he said. He smiled at her and then leaned back in the water, closing his eyes. The heat of the water was just enough to help settle his fears.</p> <p>Alyssa went around front of him, and leaned in close. "Let's get into the bed." He lifted his arms and she wrapped them around her body again, feeling him slip between them. She smiled and slid her hands into his robe, feeling him begin to relax. She looked out the door, and noticed the clock read 10:45. She smiled and headed over to the bed, which was arranged near the door with a pillow. The sheets were soft and plush, and she knew Greg would feel every inch of it this way. The door clicked shut.</p> <p>Alyssa sat on her bed. "Are you ready for our little adventure?" she asked.</p> <p>"Definitely!"</p> <p>She grabbed the bottom sheet and climbed in to the middle of the bed, laying down. Greg came in a moment later, and grabbed a couple of pillows. Their breathing was heavier than Alyssa's. He got in beside her, and then she spread her legs and put her knees in the crooks of the arms of the pillow. His arms went around her and he gently laid his head on her stomach. Greg kissed the top of her thigh, sending tingles up her body.</p> <p>"Greg, you just love doing this," she whispered.</p> <p>"I love your legs, too," he replied as he kissed her belly button. Alyssa reached down and grabbed his cock. She pulled back and looked at the head, which was already rising to life. "Want to help me wash it?" she whispered.</p> <p>Greg got under her a little. His hand made it's way to the front of her, finding the water just under his fingers. He began to wash her back. Her skin was softer than Alyssa's, but his hands explored her body. When his hand got to the crack of her ass, it was soon joined by his lips. He licked and kissed her, sliding his fingers against and across her clit. Alyssa was moaning louder now, pushing her hips up. Alyssa reached up and pulled Greg's face into her cleavage, wanting him to take her in every hole. Greg did as she asked and brought his other hand up around her neck to her mouth where she met his with a kiss.</p> <p>When they went inside, Greg stopped suddenly. "We can't wait to leave," he said.</p> <p>She took his hand and pulled him toward her. She turned his head to the side and planted her lips on his. He kissed her back, and she reached to grab his cock again. His hand was now under the water running down her body, which meant it made sense to him now that she had a hand on it. His finger slid back to the front, where he found the hood of her clit, which he began to lightly massage. Alyssa's hands were rubbing his cock, which had taken on a slight glaze. The thought of it being inside her kept Greg on edge.</p> <p>"Let's get you out of that bath," Greg said.</p> <p>"I want it to be you, Greg."</p> <p>He helped her out of the tub and pulled her up against the wall. He kissed her. "I don't want to rush this," he said.</p> <p>"No. It's time. It starts now!" Alyssa said as she pushed him back in to the wall.</p> <p>Greg took her hands and slid them down off her shoulders, to the bottom of her breasts. Greg took her nipples between thumb and forefinger and gently teased themâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
