I ask him quietly as the words come out of my mouth.</p> <p>He reaches over and takes a handful of my hair and pulls me closer to him.</p> <p>"Look at me, Mary, let me kiss you. You know I wanted to do it with you after all."</p> <p>He kisses my lips, my chin, my cheek. His tongue plays with mine as his hands move from my head all the way down to my waist, I can feel the tip of his hardness again pressing against me.</p> <p>He continues to explore between my legs his hand coming to rest on the small of my back, he leans forward to touch my jaw line. I look up at him again, I can tell he is smiling, this doesn't make me feel bad or uncomfortable, it makes me want him even more and it isn't even a feeling we are both familiar with.</p> <p>I feel like I am going to have orgasmic bliss like he did before, we are both so aroused we both seem oblivious of how we are feeling.</p> <p>He whispers in my ear once again then continues to rub himself against my thigh the wetness of his mouth making the whole area on my leg as wetness spreads.</p> <p>"Mmm, you taste so good, I want us to do this again" he whispers. I moan as his hands rub against my skin, he is so familiar with my body. I am so ready for his touches. I spread my legs to make room for him.</p> <p>I feel the tip of his cock against my leg, he moves it up a bit to rub against my crotch while his other hand is playing with my hair. He slides his hand down my leg and back up again pressing hard against my slit. I move my legs wider to let him in, I moan softly and grind myself down on to his tip slowly increasing the pressure as I feel the tip of his cock rub against my slit. I am so wet, so ready to feel him inside me, he knows exactly how I feel. I feel his hardness pushing against me as he slides his fingers under my hood, rubbing back and forth before putting his thumbs under me to apply a few additional pressure as he puts my clit into his thumb. His body moves up a little, rubbing against me the hard length of his thumb stroking me.</p> <p>His hands lift slightly then move back up a bit just under my neck with each pass of his thumb. As one hand rubs my clit back and forth while the other continues to squeeze and play with my breast I spread my legs wider, he pushes his tip hard against my lips and gently pushes it in to my body. The feel of him deep inside me sends me over the edge and I move a little bit.</p> <p>There is only an inch or 2 of the swollen length of his shaft before I feel the hard tip of his head against me. I moan with the sensation, and it is more than enough for me, he still moves his thumb on my clit with each pass he makes, as they move my body back and forth against him. I feel the tightness of his base and the pressure of me against and in him.</p> <p>"Fuck!" I moan, as his shaft pushes and slides across my clit. I can feel every little bump and ridge, he continues to rub against my pussy while he continues to play with me with his thumb. It is like we are making love, with him being completely inside me. Suddenly I feel his hands moving over my shoulders to press against me as he moves deeper within. I moan loudly feeling the tip of his head penetrate me, and then slowly slide deep into my body.</p> <p>I feel him pull back a bit and continue to push against me with his tip in me as I move with him. I feel my head go back and feel it go a bit further as he presses deep within me, I moan in pleasure as he presses against me.</p> <p>"Oh Mary, I am so close to fucking you already. You feel so nice on me, I can't stand this longer."</p> <p>"I want it to last just as long as you can make it last." I moan, knowing he will not be able to hold back much longer.</p> <p>I feel him lean forward onto the mattress, I am lying down as he lays down on top of the bed, my legs still spread apart and his legs up.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to..." I whisper.</p> <p>"It's alright. Relax. I understand." He kisses my cheek, my face again. He slides his hands down from my waist down to my hip then around to grab my butt, feeling his hands slide along the crack of my ass, he takes my hand and begins to pull my body up towards him.</p> <p>I turn aroundâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
