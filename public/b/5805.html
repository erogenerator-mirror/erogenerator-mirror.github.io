She wanted to thank him for his hospitality again. She didn't look as though she belonged there. She also didn't look like she would live forever in any man's eyes. She looked like she was about her late twenties maybe early thirties or perhaps a little less.</p> <p>And there the resemblance was made. She looked much younger. Her features were more mature than the typical college girl look she always had but that didn't seem to make her any less desirable. He wondered what her body would look like in her twenties and his cock got hard immediately. He couldn't believe it. He had always thought of himself as the luckiest guy on earth. He just wanted to jump in bed with her once and there it was.</p> <p>"Hello? Is our guest OK?" She asked.</p> <p>"Yes we're fine. That sounds great," he lied.</p> <p>"Let me just take a minute while I clear up some things," she offered. "I really have to go get the wine for dinner then."</p> <p>As he said those words he noticed she had started to move her legs apart. He didn't know what to make of it. She wasn't wearing any panties. He could see her shaved pussy lips. He could not believe his good luck. Now that his wife of 10 years had given him a hand job. God how could he have wished it wasn't with his cock. He felt like a schoolboy hoping to go to a private school and get a blow job. Now they were here and she was sitting with him.</p> <p>He watched as she slowly moved her hand from under her dress and up to her pussy. She was doing it so slowly. He knew that this could be dangerous but he didn't care. It gave him the perfect opportunity to see to see for himself what the women of her generation were doing. He got hard looking at her. He decided to just play it cool and not interrupt her while he brought his glass of wine. He was about to make a move when she stood up and grabbed his hand by the wrist, pulling him down to sit down. "Are you sure this is the right place? It's not exactly a fancy restaurant on New Years Eve." She said as she pulled him around the corner of the crowded dining room. His cock jumped at the sudden freedom.</p> <p>"Oh yeah. It's fine. It's an old one. This is my girlfriend's house." He told her.</p> <p>"No. I mean it's not a nice place." He lied back. "Why don't you stay here for awhile? I mean I don't know how much longer we can stay. You really need someone that you care about." She was trying to get his attention but she was starting to get nervous.</p> <p>She took a sip of wine then said, "Well let me make things seem normal. After all I live in a big house with a pool and privacy. What if you wanted to come by this evening, we can do it right here." He told her. "But I had a lot of fun and I think we need to get some sleep."</p> <p>It was true he did like to play her game and it really didn't bother her that he was being her knight in shining silver. But she couldn't seem to work up the nerve to suggest they go to another restaurant tonight. She wanted to stay home instead.</p> <p>"Let's go before I go back up." She suggested then added, "Besides I think we can talk about dinner later." She stood then got up and started to walk toward the door. "OK? If you want me to stay there tonight?" She asked him.</p> <p>"Uh huh. Sure. I have an early dinner." He said then watched as she walked away, looking over her shoulder, then back up and down as she headed up the hallway to join him in bed.</p> <p>He watched her pull away from him. God how he loved seeing her walk away. It was so sexy. Her shapely ass jiggling when she walked and how big and firm it looked in her shorts. As he watched her move through the hallway he decided to stop playing and go ahead and enjoy her company. He wanted to touch her. He wanted to feel and hold her tight. He wanted to hold her tight when she cried for mercy. He wanted to hear her moan with pleasure. He wanted to hear her cry for him. He wanted to hold her close after his cock shot off inside her pussy. He wanted to hear her moan. He wanted to know that it was her first time. And he didn't care anymore. He wanted to make her happy, not to ruin it for her. And he wanted to know how it felt to be held by someone other than her husband.
