"You have to understand how turned I am on right now that I want you badly. It's only because you're not there, or that it's you."</p> <p>"I'm sure that's because I can't help it. It feels so fucking good...I want to stay like this forever but I know it's going to be a while before I can, not today, but right now. Maybe we should go upstairs and sit by the pool for a bit."</p> <p>"No, let's wait for that. I'll take you upstairs."</p> <p>"You're a sweetheart, and I mean that. You don't know me too well and I like you and I don't want to lose you yet. We can do things from time to time."</p> <p>"I still don't want to lose you, but I do want to stay in your arms."</p> <p>"I'm sorry for the way I left you last night, I missed seeing you and I wanted to be with you. I felt you in me, and I thought you felt me and I wished we could be like that."</p> <p>"That sounds like a really good plan to me so it's no problem."</p> <p>We stood up and started to walk upstairs.</p> <p>"Wait here and I'll take you. You can keep your towel over your mouth and I won't get you wet."</p> <p>I sat on the edge of the bed as she went upstairs, but I kept my eyes turned away from her and followed her the rest of the way.</p> <p>"I'll be right in here." That time, I stood up and I reached across her and put my hands on her waist. "That's nice of you, letting me take you. I want to hold you, all over."</p> <p>She stepped up to me again, but stepped back a little. "I've never given a man that much consideration let alone let him show respect to me."</p> <p>"Well, you were my kind of girl and I'm a sweetheart; so I'm not trying to be nice."</p> <p>"Thank you." I took her hand and we headed into the bedroom. I sat on the edge of the bed, and she sat on the edge next to me, on the bed. I took her hand and turned her around in my lap, and she sat on my other side.</p> <p>"This is going to be my first time showing affection to a woman and I want it to be right."</p> <p>"I know...I get it..."</p> <p>She put her hand on my chest and rubbed it across my shirt, then down my stomach. "I like the way you feel inside of me...I want you like that and I want to feel you like that. Will you let me do this for you and make you more comfortable and more relaxed for me?"</p> <p>I put my hand on her thigh and she spread her legs a little and put herself on mine. She put her head on my shoulder, so I could feel her breath coming from my neck, and I could feel her hands on my body.</p> <p>"I like it." She rested her head on my other shoulder and ran her fingers through my chest hair. "I just want you to be a little more comfortable and a little excited for me."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"I want to feel you, touch you. I want my hands all over your body, and I want to be gentle and give you as much pleasure."</p> <p>"You're a good person when you let it all hang-out, but you can get in trouble if you don't be careful."</p> <p>I cupped her chin in my hand and took a deep breath. "I'm going to learn to do more than just lie here, and it can come in time just as I would want it to."</p> <p>"Honey, that's probably a good thing."</p> <p>I grabbed a handful of her hair and pulled her off me, "Okay, so I'm not going to be there...I can do whatever you want me to, and I get the right mood, just as long as you know where to put it at."</p> <p>"It's just because you don't use a lot of tools on me."</p> <p>"We'll see."</p> <p>She pulled the blankets back, and I took my pants off and threw them into the other room.</p> <p>"Don't start." She grabbed my cock and started stroking me. "I know you like me, so you can tell me all about it if I want to. But I've never been with a black man before, you're going to do everything you can to make me happy."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Really."</p> <p>"Hmh." She moved her head down a bit so she could take me in her lips.</p> <p>"Ooohâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
