A new wave started to build up in each of us and our nipples suddenly stood out, stiff and hard beneath our nightshirts. We stared deep into each others eyes as we stroked each other up and down. Both of us were breathing very slowly and we could see we were both approaching climax.</p> <p>Suddenly we looked at each other and each of us froze. I looked to my left and saw the clock read eight thirty. We looked in each other's eyes and burst into pure lust. Our lips locked and our tongues intertwined, our breathing stopped for a moment and we started to move our hands and mouths on each other. Our hips began to move faster and the pressure on both of our thighs increased, the heat and passion rising in both of us, building to a feverish pitch, our hips were now thrusting and moving in tight unison with each other and our lips were locked against each other.</p> <p>We slowly eased each other around the bed and then off to our sides. There we lay side by side, our hands working feverishly in unison and we stared deeply into each others eyes and then closed them. I held her close and slowly kissed her softly on her lips. She gently kissed my lips and I felt her tongue slide into my mouth. We kept kissing eachother for what seemed like hours.</p> <p>My hand slid down over her hip, under her robe and slowly down to her left leg, then slowly up to her stomach, and then slowly down to her hip. I continued slowly but slowly kissing her as she kept kissing me. I turned her on her back and began kissing the small of her neck. She moaned and started to move her head up and down in rhythm with my kisses. My lips and tongue began to glide downward over her shoulders and she moaned again. She began undulating her hips with each of the kisses I was giving her. My hands slid down along the small of her stomach and I felt her hand slide up and cup my balls, lightly squeezing them. At this point our kisses stopped and my hand gently moved up along her stomach and under her nightshirt, over her bra and across her breast. I moved the top of her nightshirt up, exposing the pale breast in my hand. She moaned again in response and put her hands on my head as I began to cup her breast. My lips moved to her nipple and I began licking her nipple.</p> <p>She moaned each time I licked harder and I could feel her hips moving, moving my hand across her stomach as I massaged her other breast. Her breathing had become deep and fast again and she was moaning now. Her hands moved to kiss me deeper, and she began to slide our pajamas off us and I knew she was getting the feel of each of our bodies in turn as we lay naked. "Are you on your belly?" I asked her as I was stroking her leg and she looked down to me for the answer. I smiled as I asked her. She looked back at me and with a look of disbelief on her face she said "No I'm not on my belly."</p> <p>"I know you are and we have been doing this for a while now," I replied, rubbing my hand across her mound "I'm going to get us into the proper position and start with a little lubrication. We'll see if we can get it in, too." I told her as I pulled apart my robe and got rid of it. "Lie back now," I said as I moved down between her legs, pushing them apart with my knees. "I'm going to help you," I said and began to lick and suck on her clit. I heard her let out a gasp as I sucked on her clit and then I heard her moan "oh my god." I continued to swirl my tongue around her clit as I moved down a little more to lick her lips and down to her labia. I could smell her as I licked around her pussy. I could tell by the sounds that she made she knew exactly right to what I wanted and she started to breath very heavily, "Fuck me." she told me. She wasn't going to be denied again.</p> <p>I moved my tongue down and touched her lips lightly with the tip of my tongue, and then I slowly parted them with the tip of my tongue, looking at her as I did this. A thin string of saliva connected us and connected in a way that only a woman can and I loved watching her as she moaned and cried when I finally touched her with my tongue. I could taste her salty sex, her juices. I slowly extended the tip of my tongue and slowly licked up over her lips as it extended down and then I licked over her clit, back up and around her lips. She was so close to orgasmâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
