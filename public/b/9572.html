He started to pull down my top, but I stopped him.</p> <p>"Leave it on. I thought you might like that. Now take off your blouse."</p> <p>His hands were on my shoulders as I pulled the top of my blouse over to reveal my tiny lace bra. I unclasped my bra in the back and slipped my arms out, letting the straps fall silently down my arms before I could catch the rest of my blouse. With a sly smile I tossed my hair back and let my hair down to the middle of my back and hooked the fingers of my left hand in the middle of my back, letting it fall over my left breast. He leaned forward and kissed me, his tongue pushing past my lips while his hands slid down my chest so he could cup and rub my breasts. My breast was in his hand, his finger tips brushing across my erect nipple while the other hand was pressing the crotch of my skirt against my thigh. While we continued kissing, I had slid my skirt up and was sitting on top of him, my legs wrapped tightly around his, my feet digging into the ground.</p> <p>I pulled my mouth off from his and looked at him, his eyes full of eager anticipation, and as his erection jumped up and down, it made a tiny shimmy against his jeans. "Are you sure we shouldn't go to my flat as we agreed?"</p> <p>He nodded and pressed into a bit more, his arms pressing me down with the strength of his hands, pulling me into him again. "Well I didn't see you there, you look kind of..." he shrugged, "over the top." He laughed and I leaned my head against his chest, a flush rising to my cheeks.</p> <p>"What do you mean? I had no idea what a girl like you did with men like men. You're a girl!"</p> <p>"No, seriously you aren't."</p> <p>He stepped back and pulled something from my purse. "What is it?"</p> <p>I shrugged it off and stood up against his waist again, pressing my hip against his. I smiled to let him know that my outfit was off as well, and he pulled something from the pocket of his jeans and handed it to me. I opened the back and pulled out three items from another bag, one of them holding a pair of slacks and a button down shirt. I pulled them on with ease and he shrugged. I took them and closed down the bag, and when I turned up the heels and zippers in them again, he nodded and let her out. I turned around and sat down next to him on the couch where we had kissed.</p> <p>"This time you wear these," I pushed one shoe into his mouth and ran my foot up his leg, "and you look so sexy in them. I couldn't wait to get back to town so I could have you."</p> <p>"I couldn't wait either," he stepped over to me, placing his left hand behind my head on the back of the couch. He tugged my chin up so I looked him in the eyes, making me smile while my tongue stuck out and ran between the lips of my mouth. I watched him as he ran his hands up the sides of my face, pulling me closer once more.</p> <p>"I'm feeling a bit of a rush right now, you're wearing these and just looking so pretty. I can definitely get you into bed."</p> <p>I nodded and pulled my head away from his, sitting up a bit to smile at him. "You're a beautiful man."</p> <p>He leaned in to give my cheek a quick peck, his lips brushing lightly over mine, making me shiver. I leaned in further, pushing up my chin, my eyes closing as I felt the warmth from his lips against mine. Before I could pull back for another kiss, my eyelids closed, and his tongue slipped between my lips. I sucked on it for a little while, a smile creeping on my lips as he brought his hands up from my hips and cupped under my breasts. I felt my body react as he squeezed my nipples through my bra, and his head leaned back as his mouth slid down to my neck, breathing heavily as I sucked on it.</p> <p>I pulled my head back slightly and brought my hands back up to run them along his cheeks while our lips locked together once more. I put my hands to my sides and let my arms fall down a little to prop my weight against his body. He pulled my hands down again and I pushed them toward his belt.</p> <p>"Hey! Hold on, wait, hold on."</p> <p>I pulled his belt out of the loops of his jeans and unbuttoned the top button before letting his pants slide down the top of his thighs. I took a moment to look up at him from behind as he pulled his pants down around his ankles, but the hunger in his eyes made meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
