I cried. "I can't do this!"</p> <p>"That was an awesome orgasm," he chuckled, licking my wet slit. "Your husband's only a few rooms down."</p> <p>"And you can't get the key when the door is opened," laughed Bob. I couldn't resist the temptation. "So we have company, who wants to do something about it??"</p> <p>"Well," began Bob, "You can have his cock if you want. But if it happens a couple of minutes later, when we come, just knock on the door—we are on our way."</p> <p>"But I can't," I said, but he was already getting dressed, leaving me sitting in the doorway, naked.</p> <p>"Hurry the fuck up, and get me my keys," Bob said, tossing me my keychain, telling me to go in his room and wait for him then go back to my husband. I went in, and waited in the dark.</p> <p>Bob, he told me, was going to the shower now, so I'd better wait until he came out. I went into the house himself, and found my husband's car in the garage. He must have left some spare key in the car. My husband was in it. I couldn't see the car in the front lot.</p> <p>I don't know how long I waited. But finally, they both came out. When they came, he had nothing on: his shorts and sweater were gone.</p> <p>He had on a short skirt and some pretty slutty heels. And he had some lotion in his hand, rubbing it all over his shaft.</p> <p>That bastard had my nipples! No matter how much I protested, he ignored me. Then he started kissing me and sucking my breasts. All his weight was on me and I was helpless.</p> <p>My husband had taken my skirt and panties off by the time we got inside the shower—so I was naked in seconds as he took my skirt off. Then he had the other side off and he spread my legs for the water to fill him up. When we were in the shower, naked, I begged him to fuck me. But he was no gentleman. He told me he planned the night to be my first and to be the first to be fucked by a man. I knew what that meant, since he had no idea, but, I did think I could have a little fun, too.</p> <p>The whole time he sucked my nipples, he fondled my vagina, feeling my wetness on his finger. With my husband so close to me, he stopped kissing me to let me stand on tip-toes to kiss Bob. It was my first kiss with any man! As my lips met Bob's, I felt the tension in the air. Finally, Bob reached down to feel my vagina again. I don't know if I should have let him do it, but I wanted him to do it.</p> <p>It was like the touch of his fingers on my vagina felt natural—like he was holding his penis in his hand and guiding it into its opening. I closed my eyes as I felt Bob's penis touch my vagina walls. I couldn't pull away. The feeling was magical. My clitoris felt like it was a little pebble. It was a tight bud to feel Bob's penis in me—an invitation.</p> <p>Finally I felt Bob's penis touch my clitoris and I let out a little moan of pleasure. I realized I could be impaled by Bob's penis when Bob pushed a little too hard against my vagina. So I reached back and guided his penis back inside of me.</p> <p>My husband was just standing there looking at us, watching everything. My whole body began to tingle. I had never felt so aroused in our entire married life!</p> <p>Bob slowly pushed his penis into my vagina, feeling me stretch to accommodate him, and then it all disappeared inside of me, filling me with his penis. "Fuck me, Bob. Fuck me," I begged him.</p> <p>And he did. Every moment that the next second, I felt his warm hard penis deep inside of me. He was so gentle, so gentle, that after a minute or so of pushing, I was on my way to another climax, when Bob finally pushed inside me, giving me the first orgasm.</p> <p>"Oh, God, I'm coming!" I gasped aloud as I came. And when I finally came down from it, Bob's penis was still inside of me. Then he pulled out and turned me around to kiss me. He whispered in my ear that he and he will fuck me again in the morning.</p> <p>Later that night, Bob had told me to wake in the middle of the night, to suck up all that time. I had been so horny from watching me that I didn't know—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
