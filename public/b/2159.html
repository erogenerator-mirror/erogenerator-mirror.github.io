He continues to stare at her.</p> <p>"It's all your fault. You were going to put in a good word for me."</p> <p>"You want what we have here to continue?" Mr. Stone starts to smile.</p> <p>"I don't know."</p> <p>"Yes, you do. I saw things that I thought I should never see. This is not a way to do it on your own."</p> <p>Mr. Stone leans forward, reaching out for her again, his face inches from hers. Their faces meet; hers hard, his soft, almost masculine with a strong, gentle expression. His hand touches hers, a light caress. She feels a tiny spark of excitement race across the plane.</p> <p>"I'm not doing this for money," he smiles.</p> <p>"I'm not doing this for money either." She starts to step back.</p> <p>"Come on, let's get off the plane." He continues to guide her with his hand over her face as they walk past the stewardess. They enter the security area. As they pass the desk, she begins to get up, then starts to feel nauseous as the heat from her legs and ass begins to get to her.</p> <p>"I'm going to take care of it right here." He looks down at his watch as if to say that this had a while before, maybe even earlier.</p> <p>As they walk away from the desk, she's afraid to look back at him. His arm moves around her, holding her hand. As they pass by another security desk, he gives her his hand, this time to hers. She starts to feel light-headed as the heat and scent of his body permeates the room. They stop, and stare at each other, a bit too long. She looks out the window into the darkness of the airport and sees the dark clouds beginning to gather. They begin to separate, looking for the nearest exit.</p> <p>"Here," Mr. Stone gestures to his desk, "I am going to the restroom. I can be quick about it." He turns to her and looks her in her eyes.</p> <p>"No, come with me," he says, "You will need one." He takes her hand, leads her to the door, and opens it. As they enter, they find he is standing directly in front of her, holding her hand, looking her over. He places his hands on either side of her hips, and pulls her against himself. He whispers into her ear, "If what you say is true, you're going to be very wet." He takes his hand away, turning her around. "And I want you to feel as wet as I am." He says as he runs a finger along the seam of her panties over and over, making her gasp and arch her back. He slides two fingers into her pussy again, making her moan. He pulls her panties off by the ankles, and throws them to the floor. "Let's get you out of those things." He takes his fingers out of her pussy, and slides them into his mouth, tasting her. He looks her in the eyes as he begins to lick her.</p> <p>"No, don't. I can't," she whispers to him.</p> <p>"I want to," he whispers, "I want to, but I don't have a condom."</p> <p>"No. I don't care," she whispers back, "but I really don't, you know."</p> <p>"Yes you do. I want to feel you. I want to." He stands her up, and then picks her up, placing her in his arms.</p> <p>He stands up as they kiss again. Their tongues exploring each others mouths, one another. He pushes his right hand out, sliding his hand along her left hip, slowly, slowly, feeling the skin move up and down her body. He kisses her lower lip, then her chin, before kissing her nose. He kisses her cheeks, then her chin, and finally her neck, pulling her closer. His hand glides over her breast, over the fabric of her t-shirt, feeling her firm, fullness, and the nipples hardening. He kisses her neck, then her earlobe, and then her chin, finally her lips. She feels the tip of his tongue just under her earlobe before he reaches down to her pussy and begins to rub it between his fingers. He slides his hand underneath her t-shirt, his hand brushing the cotton material over her breasts, over her stomach, over her waistband. He takes her left nipple into his mouth and begins to suck on it, biting down on it lightly. She moans again as he moves his hands down to her panties, feeling the material, sliding them down, feeling her. He slips one finger in between her lips, movingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
