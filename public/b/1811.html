I was shaking and she was smiling. When we got closer, she leaned a little closer and reached around my waist and cupped both cheeks with both hands.</p> <p>"I can't believe you're not married."</p> <p>"I wish I was."</p> <p>"Me too."</p> <p>She leaned me back and I held onto her ass and she pushed me back a little and then backed away with each backward thrust. I couldn't keep my balance as she bent down and kissed me then held me around the waist and we started rolling to the sound of the chorus.</p> <p>"You guys get some music? I need to get on the road. I'm not going to keep going through the same thing for the rest of our lives." We finished the song in harmony and grabbed each other and kissed so passionately that it took my breath away. As our hands traveled over our bodies, my erection became a thing of power as she touched me. Her breath quickened and she was breathing hard. Her breasts were pressing against my chest. I reached down between us and felt her pussy. We were still standing, I held onto her ass a little, she was still on her knees. My hands were all over her body. My fingertips felt her round ass, her nipples were hard and pressing against my fingertips.</p> <p>"Don't we have enough music," I said, but of course she already knew that.</p> <p>She leaned over me, she turned my erection so that it was pointing straight up a little, and rested her ass on my crotch. I leaned back a little and reached over to play the music. Her arms went around my shoulders while we listened to the song again, our kiss becoming more urgent. She moved more aggressively and reached down and grabbed my erection and began to stroke me. A drop of pre-come formed right where pre-come would have been and she licked it off her lower lip. Our kiss went from soft to hard again and she continued stroking me. Her nipples were on my chest, almost like a little hand. There was something so erotic about feeling her nipple against my chest and the fact that the way she was squeezing and stroking me felt incredible.</p> <p>"I can't believe we're just sitting here playing music," I said while we continued to finger-fuck each other. "I can't believe how sexy you are!" Before I could make out the words, she looked back and continued on with the music.</p> <p>We were still standing, I was still holding both of her hands but she put one of them on my penis and slowly rubbed me while we listened to the song. I could feel her nipples on my chest and the way she moved on my shaft made me think that some part of our being was on that point of attraction. I could have held on but for something else. In the next song, she pulled her fingers away and took me into her mouth, as the song began and she moaned. I was ready to cum but she pulled her mouth off of me so she could talk a little bit.</p> <p>"It is that time."</p> <p>She kissed me.</p> <p>"I know. I didn't tell you how badly I'm going to want you then but I didn't tell you to make sure everything was just to go with the flow. I have a feeling about this song that I really did want to make sure that we were going to feel what we felt earlier that one night."</p> <p>She took my erection back in her mouth. "But are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yes." I said.</p> <p>"You want me to make sure you don't go to the bathroom on the way here. Is that what you want?"</p> <p>"Yes. Yes, absolutely! There, do it again!"</p> <p>She stood up. After a few seconds she pulled away from me and stood up, she turned around on the small dance floor. She looked back at me and said, "There now, I have to have one last dance." She went to the DJ and said something I couldn't hear. I looked back and saw the same black guy dancing, with an even better smile on his face and the same smile in his eyes when he saw her. She kissed him on the neck and I couldn't believe my eyes.</p> <p>She danced a bit further, then started kissing, but stopped again and turned around so me she was facing me. She gave me this smoldering look.</p> <p>"Why don't you make it a bit of a show?" she said with a smile. "I don't want to miss anything of you." She turned to me and put her hands on the outside of my legs. She stood up and bent over slightly, she pulled her cheeks apart and stuck out the tongue of the tip. I could feel my knees go weak.</p> <p>"God, you get some nerve," I said.</p> <p>"Don't worry, you wonâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
