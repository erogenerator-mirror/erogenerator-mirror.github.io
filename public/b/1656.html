"Oh god, yes..." she said. She had been rubbing her clit for several minutes now. She wasn't sure why.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want this? This is going to happen, right?"</p> <p>"Yes" she said as I slipped a finger inside her wet pussy.</p> <p>"OK, I want to try fucking you."</p> <p>"Oh god, yes! Fuck me" was all she was going to say.</p> <p>I kissed and licked her nipples, flicked them with my tongue. I slid a wet finger inside her, then a finger again, and in a short time, I was rubbing her g-spot, which made her pussy tighten on my cock. Her hips started bucking back and forth.</p> <p>I slid my other hand between her legs. I placed my thumb on her clit and began to roll it between my fingers. Her hips started moving back and forth faster and faster. Every thrust would push my cock deep inside her. Her breasts and pussy juices were streaming out of her hole and making it glisten in the bright morning light.</p> <p>"Oh god! Oh god! YES!" she shouted as I thrust deeper and deeper into her. "Oh my god" she screamed again.</p> <p>I had reached my orgasm right then and there, with this woman I had never met, naked, her pussy still contracting in waves around my cock.</p> <p>"OH YES, YES!" she screamed as I felt my orgasm begin. "OH FUCK!" I yelled out. I kept thrusting inside her as my cum began to spew into her.</p> <p>My body shook as I continued to cum deep inside her.</p> <p>"Oh yessssss" I screamed into her ear.</p> <p>"Oh yes" she said.</p> <p>All this time we had been locked in our passion. Now we were moving on a sexual wave, one I thought would be so intense as to have been indescribable. My thrusts were going so fast that we were practically bouncing into each other like wild animals. It felt as though we had to be in a race to be the first to cum again. Beth moaned every time of me coming out of her pussy, so did I. But for now, all I could feel was her pussy squeezing my cock. I rolled off of her and lay down next to her. She turned toward me and we kissed long and hard. She had the look of ecstasy on her face as she lay beside me.</p> <p>"I haven't climaxed like that in years" she said "but you were wonderful!"</p> <p>We lay there for awhile, kissing and touching. Finally Beth pulled on her tee shirt. I got out of bed and slipped my shorts on over my still half hard cock. She reached for my arm and led me back out to the shower. We got in and began to soaped each other. I moved my soapy hand up to her pussy and she was just looking at me. We kissed and made out for a while, playing with each other, enjoying the feel of our bodies together.</p> <p>After a while we got out and dried each other. Beth slipped on a pair of panties. We grabbed a robe off the bureau. It would be cold in the bedroom, but it was a nice warm day and we could get at our business without being snow-covered. We headed to the bedroom and found that there was not a porter or a maid. So we were alone and just relaxed.</p> <p>"Do you want to put on a sweater? It is so warm out." Beth asked.</p> <p>"Sure, in a second" I said.</p> <p>"We don't live that far away from here do we?" she suggested.</p> <p>She led me upstairs and we had our breakfast there. Neither of us wore a bra. In all the excitement of the day, and what we both didn't want to admit to ourselves at the time, there was not much left to the imagination! We ate and drank a lot of juice, and talked a ton. I could tell that we were both getting excited and had the need for some sex.</p> <p>"Do you want to take off your panties if we go ahead? I don't want to see your nipples." Beth said.</p> <p>"Why not? We are already naked here." I said.</p> <p>"Of course you are, but I don't want you to feel too self conscious or exposed." Beth said, "This time we are just getting started. If you don't want to go through with your idea, just say so and we can keep it in mind. Besides, since you put the idea in my head, it's not so obvious when the other side of the door is closed" she told me.</p> <p>She was right.
