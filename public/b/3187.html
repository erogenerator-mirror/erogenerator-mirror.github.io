Are you sure you can't forgive him?"</p> <p>"I don't know, but you know, this man is the last thing I ever want to do," Gertram said, feeling sad.</p> <p>"Just make sure," Amy whispered.</p> <p>"I'll have him back to you some day."</p> <p>He kissed Gertram and left. He would be staying a week. That was it.</p> <p>Gertram and Amy sat on the porch in the darkness and talked for the next hour. They looked out at the huge lake and watched the water roll back, washing up old fog in the distance.</p> <p>"Amy, you are a crazy girl, what happened to you?" Gertram asked.</p> <p>"I'm not afraid of what happened Gertram ... or you," Amy replied, and then thought it over.</p> <p>"I have never felt so much for anyone in my whole life. It's like, I'm an old friend and he was my brother."</p> <p>Gertram didn't know what to say, so he decided to just say it.</p> <p>"Amy, I love you very much."</p> <p>This made Amy feel strange and a little uncomfortable.</p> <p>"Gertram, we are never going to live like this again," she said.</p> <p>"I'm sorry about earlier. I feel so guilty and sorry for hurting you."</p> <p>Amy felt even more weird.</p> <p>"I'm not saying that I don't feel guilty about it. It's just that I'm not sure that I want to."</p> <p>"Just relax, Amy. It's not that much. Go out, have a romantic dinner, and talk about life again. It's going to change your life. Go to happy places and make love. Go make love," Gertram said.</p> <p>"I don't have that going on," Amy said.</p> <p>Gertram grabbed Amy's hand and dragged her back inside.</p> <p>"Amy, I'm not saying that you can't love and be happy. I know you have a lot of experience."</p> <p>Amy started up the stairs, trying to find the right path. Her father was a jerk with Amy and didn't trust her in her school books or her grades on social science. Gertram pulled her into his arms and kissed her cheek.</p> <p>"Don't ever forget that. I can't keep my mouth closed and I have never lied about our relationship," Gertram said.</p> <p>"I understand Gertram. I know. I think I may fall in love with Amy from now on" Amy whispered.</p> <p>Gertram kissed her again.</p> <p>"There are lots of guys in my college who would not like to get into a relationship with you, and we can talk about it until we both get what we want. So sit on the steps and let them get to know you. Now come over to my house with me and let's make love." They made love that night in her room. Gertram loved her and didn't make love to her. He was just in for an unpleasant surprise.</p> <p>Amy told Gertram that they had to stop. Her parents would be home soon, but she didn't feel good about their visit without telling them. Amy stayed at Gertram's house after school and made sure they got to know each other.</p> <p>Gertram decided to wait until Amy arrived in town before he took her home. He didn't want to take her on a date. He couldn't bear to see her or touch her while Amy was in school. Even though it was the right thing to do, he didn't like the thought of dating a girl from another school. If they got married after graduation, it would be at her parents' estate and the two of them would probably have sex and then just make a big mess if anyone found out.</p> <p>Amy was still learning about loving a woman. She liked the idea of having her own private place. It really wasn't like her mother and her friends. So she started hanging out at his house after school the weekend after last. She would spend the weekend shopping and she was the perfect housewife.</p> <p>She was always very shy and could never talk to anyone about her love for Gertram. However, her fear seemed to have passed, because she would talk to him now. She spent her day telling him about her love life before and now. They made love. She even came up out of the closet when they were kissing.</p> <p>That night Gertram gave her a new perspective on love. He was sure that someday he would have someone like Amy and that someday wouldâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
