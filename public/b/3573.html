He almost jumped on my lap, but he didn't say anything; he just let my hands slowly slide lower until I was cupping his ass.</p> <p>I was not the only one. I was the only one that was in control. I was the one pulling him down onto the couch with me, then pressing his face into my neck so he was looking into my eyes, which made me want to take over. And when he came to rest on the couch, I could feel his heart pounding so hard in his ribcage that it hurt him. I loved it, too, but I didn't want to risk falling down.</p> <p>My tongue swiped across the bottom of his ear, then my lips trailed down across his collar bones to his shoulder blade. We both gasped and froze in unison to watch our guest rise slightly. His head tilted up and his jaw trembled slightly. He took a long, deep breath, then his lips parted slightly, causing his neck to part slightly, exposing the skin that he loved so much.</p> <p>I traced my tongue down the front of his chest to his nipple, teasingly slowly. His chest heaved heavily as he continued breathing in shallow breaths, his arms and legs wrapping around me. My hand slid down onto his thigh, feeling the muscles rippling beneath his skin. I could see him shift, so I let my hand trail higher. I slid my hand back until I encountered the tip of his hardening cock. It was so hard it was pulsing with every beat of his heart, even when he tried not to.</p> <p>I took my mouth away from his body and I looked back at the couch, then to his lips. "We'll go on, then...I think I need to work this over."</p> <p>"Hhhmmmm." His smile was sweet, not harsh, and I couldn't believe his words. "I don't know how I can handle all of this. You're right, you really are lovely."</p> <p>My own smile returned, and I shifted into a sitting position. My right hand slipped down to brush against his thigh, then my other hand slid around behind his neck. I tilted his chin up and kissed him gently, lightly, and as his body relaxed against mine, I felt his hand on my back, pulling me in, not really a sexual move. It just felt right.</p> <p>The fire between us was dying between us, however, and he pulled back a little bit, so he could look me directly in the eyes, then leaned in to put his lips to mine.</p> <p>I felt them there for a moment, as his lips parted and I saw a slight smile curl at the edges. This time, however, I felt the kiss as his tongue tentatively slid along my lips. He didn't put his mouth onto mine, but he let his tongue slide into my mouth. As they touched, he pressed me into the couch with both hands, not hard, but strong. His tongue tasted of cinnamon in a manner that I had never experienced before. I liked it.</p> <p>I closed my eyes, wanting to relish the sensation for as long as I could. He pulled back, allowing my lips to slowly part, my tongue flickering around in the small opening. I moved my face closer and let my kisses trail toward his lips, but he resisted. "Stop, please." I whispered softly, as quietly as I could get. He looked back at me, then back to the couch again. "Come?"</p> <p>I sat back to look at him. He took a moment to catch his breath, then took off his shirt. His chest was taut and smooth, the slightest movement of his stomach making his abs tighten and jump. He wore a simple black button-up shirt with a wide black belt. It was slightly shorter than the previous one. The belt was only halfway undone, so it hung on his hips while he stepped out of the boxers that I had left on him when we met. I had noticed he had a large black tattoo, just above his left hip, on one side. He was obviously wearing an intricate, black and white design, but the design was quite different from what his arms normally looked like. When he bent and pulled his underwear down, his stomach seemed to look like it was made to be stretched around a large, muscular forearm.</p> <p>"I like those tattoos." he said, smiling and reaching around his own pants to take his own shirt. I could feel the muscles in the shoulder and back of his arm twitch under his shirt as I pulled down the shirt and tossed it into a corner of the room. His shirt fit perfectly, but I felt my jaw drop a little as I looked at his muscled shoulders. He looked incredibly masculine, and he wasn't wearing any pants. There was little that I could really feel for his bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
