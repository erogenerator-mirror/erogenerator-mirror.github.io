I stammered. "We'll talk tomorrow." She gave a knowing nod of the head.</p> <p>The next ten days were spent with us watching a baseball game and talking to my parents about the school. They seemed quite friendly, and we would occasionally have dinner. That was unusual, but they didn't seem very intrusive when it came to me. It took every ounce of strength I had not to throw myself on top of the food they had served.</p> <p>At work there was a lot of awkwardness between the guys. I didn't like them either, as any of them. They tended to talk about sports, politics and gossip as if I wasn't there and they were in on the discussion. It seemed quite strange, in a way that made me feel that they had me confused, like there was no one else there to talk to. What could be said? To anyone else it would look like an unwanted intrusion.</p> <p>After a particularly uncomfortable confrontation, I was told to pick up my co-workers at the local coffee shop. I didn't really know what to expect, but I knew that was impossible. It took a lot of nerves, but then I was surprised to hear the familiar sounds of music playing on the radio. It came from the speakers and felt as if I was in on a rare Christmas Eve.</p> <p>It was not the traditional "good" music, however. It was the music for my family, and it was quite loud and was actually quite exciting. I could be heard by my fellow employees, and they would comment about how I made myself look as I sat down. Some of them got up and moved, but then disappeared.</p> <p>One or two of the other members of my family began to move around, and it was not one of those things they seemed able to do. The only person that seemed to be aware of this, it seemed, was me.</p> <p>"I am not going home with you; I am going home with you...," I whispered, as the door behind me opened and all of the others came running in.</p> <p>"You know!" A man in a white coat said, and I heard the voice of the tall one in front of me. It was clearly not my dad, but it could easily be from him. "I love it. Now I am going to get you some breakfast,"</p> <p>I could feel my heart leap, and it felt as if it were a mile high. I knew that I had made a mistake. I was not sure what to think. I wanted to say no, but that would be lying.</p> <p>"I'm really sorry... I mean... it's very nice to see you," the person before me said softly. "You just... you look so young. I'm sorry I can't stay with you that long..."</p> <p>I felt myself blushing.</p> <p>The guy to my left was no better. It was obvious that he was older, and had a lot of money. I guess he could be in his late fifties. His clothing, which I had observed more than once, appeared to be of the type that could have belonged to someone in his time. He was wearing a white t-shirt and, his hands were not too hairy either. I wondered if he had had much experience in that area.</p> <p>"Thank you," I managed. "It's nice to see you again. I thought you knew me."</p> <p>"And you look very nice in the morning, too," one of the men said, and I felt my lips form the smile of recognition.</p> <p>"Well, it depends on how hungry you are. I'm sure most of your co workers are either sleeping or walking in the street."</p> <p>Another one of the men said, and I felt a bit apprehensive.</p> <p>"So, you can't come by and get me food." I was trying to figure out what to expect.</p> <p>"Of course! All of you can come by. I want you to help me move some boxes around or something."</p> <p>Another one, a young black man, said, and I was sure it was him. He had a really nice voice and was obviously interested in what was going on at the coffee shop.</p> <p>"It doesn't have anything to do with food. Just my brother. My sister asked me if she could come along and help me carry the dirty plates in, and to bring out the garbage and things as fast as I can. She said that she could leave tomorrow morning if I could help her do it and she could come around, too."</p> <p>He was quite convincing there, and I was surprised I was able to be so turned on by it. I mean it would have been very easy, but it wasn't hard to see that his money had gone to someone else at that party. It had been nice of him to say that.</p> <p>The young manâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
