He had always been the one to tell you this, it had never been said to you, never even heard your name or called your name. Now as the tears spilled out he was unable to hide the horror that was clearly ripping through his soul.</p> <p>You may have known, if you had known it was you who was in the room when I came to join you and had seen the emotions I'm sure we both felt. I know you were scared to tell me, I'd have given up in a heartbeat if I knew you were so vulnerable. But the way you looked at me, you didn't want me to know who your son actually was. I think those words are best left unsaid or, as so many of us are now, unsaid and unspoken, no one will be hurt or angry with you. Do you know that you are just starting over?</p> <p>I felt you shift to find the space to move, your back to me, your head resting on my chest. You reached behind your head and turned looking in my eyes. Your fingers were already sliding down the length of my body to my belt buckle. I shivered just a little as you ran the tips of your fingers along the edge of my briefs. You looked up into my eyes and laughed when you felt your own cock jerking at the attention it had apparently been receiving from two women who had brought you down from your own ecstasy. I think you enjoyed knowing that both women felt that there was something quite different about the way you reacted at that moment.</p> <p>"Ohhh, do you like that? Do you have that thing between your legs like in the club?" I felt you lean forward and rub your face along my stomach.</p> <p>I didn't respond; I don't know if I'd really or even if I was going to, but I could feel the heat of your breath on my skin. When I couldn't react you moved down my ribs to my groin and began to stroke the length of my dick. The feeling of your delicate fingers against my cock caused me to start to buck and I felt myself grow just a bit bigger. You smiled your lips across one of my nipples causing goose pimples in the area beneath your touch. I could feel your warm breath on my stomach as you took the entirety of my dick in your mouth. As you slowly stroked the shaft in and out of your mouth your hand rubbed the underside and I could feel myself start getting harder and begin to twitch. I could just reach out with my fingers and caress your face and your hair as you sucked me. But I didn't move, I couldn't do anything more than whimper against the feel of your hand.</p> <p>I didn't fight as you rose up off me. I could feel you looking at me through the darkness of the room.</p> <p>"Is everyone else awake?" You asked, almost as if you expected an answer to some sort of unspoken question.</p> <p>"Honey, I'm not sure. I think we are all going to be too... tired to get up." I felt you stand up and move to sit on the chair. I tried to follow you, but it was just an awkward position with me straddling the arms that held you, but you pushed yourself away from me.</p> <p>"Honey, I want to be here for the rest of the night." You started to explain. I knew exactly who it was that you were talking to, but the tone of the conversation was a bit different.</p> <p>As I continued to kneel in front of you I could feel the tangle of your hair between my legs and knew that your eyes were wide with desire. I started by tracing the fingers of my right hand along the inside of your thigh, not touching you, but just brushing your smooth skin. When I reached the bottom of your foot I stopped to look up into your eyes.</p> <p>"Please, I....I want you, please...." I begged as the feeling of my hand moving upwards to brush against your inner thigh was enough to bring you to full erection, I couldn't believe I was being this far and then to have you lying there, legs spread, waiting, but I had to.</p> <p>But you didn't move. You had one hand in your lap, trying to hide the fact that you were not just sitting in my lap. Your legs were slightly parted and the hand that was closest to your face was stroking you lightly, the other hand was still touching your chest and playing with your soft skin. I could feel myself starting to get a bit of an erection at the sight of you lying there in front of me, not just looking at me but also feeling yourself throbbing, knowing that I was being watched.</p> <p>I moved my fingers higher and felt the heat of your skin against me. Your thighs were parted ever so slightly and I could feel my dick pressingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
