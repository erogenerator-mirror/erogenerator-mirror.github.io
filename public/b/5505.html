I asked. "Is this how we want it?"</p> <p>The kids ran up and hugged me, all of them laughing.</p> <p>"Shhh," he said, as he placed his hands on my shoulders and looked me in the eye. "We'll explain in a moment. Right now I want to make sure you enjoy your day in the game." He smiled at the kids as I looked at them; they smiled back. "I'm sorry about last night. I don't want this to become an ongoing sexual affair."</p> <p>"That's okay."</p> <p>The four of them led me to my room, where they stripped me naked, then the oldest son, who was in his forties, took his clothes off. He was a good boy as he entered me, then put his cock in me, thrusting a few strokes into me.</p> <p>With my mouth on the last part of the pizza, he pulled out of me, then began to pound me, all the while telling the kids.</p> <p>"Just hold onto me while we fuck."</p> <p>To this day I'll always remember his last words as he was coming inside me, and I'll remember those words forever.</p> <p>"Oh, it feels so good."</p> <p>They all had orgasms, and then they sat on my bed and watched as I cleaned myself.</p> <p>"That's something every parent should do, isn't it?" He asked. "You can tell me anything you want about it. It makes me feel so special."</p> <p>"I'll never tell a soul."</p> <p>He handed me a tissue from the dispenser on my locker that was near the door. I took it back to the den where the girls were having sex again.</p> <p>"So, is this your own decision?" I asked.</p> <p>"This is the game. The game is about to be done. This may be the start of something much more intense than masturbation."</p> <p>I laughed as I looked at them all, and said "Let's do it. We're all adults here."</p> <p>"I guess so, but why not start already?" I laughed as I said it. "I'm just going to be in the shower."</p> <p>"It was a mistake, and besides, I'm sure my mom would be asleep if she heard me complaining about the noise."</p> <p>A few minutes later the door opened, and we all entered my room where the five of us were naked. There was a full-fledged sexual relationship in all that occurred in just a few seconds. The children giggled and laughed at the scene.</p> <p>"What do you girls think now?" I asked before the pizza arrived.</p> <p>I don't think anyone else was in the room this time. When the last of the ice had arrived in the room, the girls all lay next to me, each looking at me. I took a piece of paper off the floor with a smile, then looked at them. They looked at the paper, then back at me.</p> <p>"What do you think now?" I asked.</p> <p>Both of them looked at each other and shook their heads.</p> <p>"It's too early to do really anything, so we're going to have to do something," Mike said. "We'll take the pizza home, then we will have a quick coffee, then we'll go out to eat."</p> <p>The other four smiled then looked at me. "We've decided that it's too early to do anything, so now we can just say 'goodnight'" and go to sleep, right?"</p> <p>"Right."</p> <p>"Are you ready for this?" I asked. "Let's go."</p> <p>I led them out to the living room, where the boys sat on couches, looking out at the lake. The youngest looked at me as I walked by.</p> <p>"Hey, I thought we were going to watch a little TV this morning?"</p> <p>"Of course," I said.</p> <p>"Well, I'm glad that's over, because you are going to have it to remember us by, aren't you? That's right, you look so wonderful."</p> <p>"Well, I don't know, but I'm going to enjoy this."</p> <p>We all sat down on couches and started watching a movie, each of the boys in one corner with one on the screen. Mike and I talked quietly, and each of us looked at me and smiled. I smiled back, and each of the boys grinned as they sat their eyes on my face.</p> <p>"Are you getting wet, sweetheart?" I asked.</p> <p>The guys just shook their heads.</p> <p>"We'll have something in mind, too."</p> <p>We kept watching the movie.
