When we were in the bathroom earlier that day, she didn't look at me much at first. She had the most loving look about her. She was just staring straight into my eyes with an expression that reminded me of a cat purring like a kitten. I could tell that she was trying hard not to be obvious about her state of arousal.</p> <p>A little bit after that point my cell phone rang. She answered it and looked over to me with a smile.</p> <p>"Good, you weren't kidding!" she said. Our conversation started off as if we were talking a movie on the phone but it quickly turned to a real quickie of fucking.</p> <p>"I'll have breakfast over," I said. "I have a car to get back to, so I need to get my car, so I need to take my car back to the office."</p> <p>"Oh, is that all you have to do," she said. "And why don't you stay in tonight, you can come stay with us while you're here."</p> <p>"Thanks for thinking of me," I said. "But I feel like I'm taking for granted everything that's happened so far today. I'm not sure where things are going to go from here." It looked like she understood. "I can't really tell you what I'm going to tell you."</p> <p>"You're going to tell me things you never would have figured out by yourself," she said with a wink. "You know what I like to do to myself and how that gives me an edge?" She went on to explain just what she liked to do to herself. She had a habit of getting into her panties at home and she never used them. She was always wearing a pair that were too tight, not too loose.</p> <p>She went on to say that she could do a whole lot of things to herself that way, but that was the price she had to pay to have the courage to do them. She said that she always loved to "go to the restroom" and watch herself pee, just to watch her pussy juices run down her leg. It was a very simple, yet very erotic, little thrill as she used a small amount of toilet paper to wipe the cum from her leg from her pussy. Sometimes when she was standing in front of the mirror she would bend over and I could see the lips on each side of her pussy lips, which were very visible. It felt exciting to see the lips all wet and swollen around her vagina.</p> <p>When I asked if her boyfriend, Mike, ever had her to the restroom, she only laughed and shook her head. She got up and started walking toward the door and looked back, a little nervous. "We'll see about that!" she said. "I have a date with Mike tonight. Don't you want to see it too?" She closed the door and turned around to see the look of total delight on my face. I didn't have to say anything. She turned around to me and gave me a very soft kiss that lasted for only a few seconds, then we parted and I told her I would like to go to the bathroom sometime that day. After saying goodbye to her I just looked at her and said, "I can't thank you enough, you're really one sexy little thing."</p> <p>She smiled with a twinkle in her eye. "I'll give it five hundred bucks if you don't mind if I call me tonight. I guess I should get going."</p> <p>As soon as she was out of sight I grabbed my bag of toilet paper. It looked like it would have been cheaper that way.</p> <p>I got a text a while later when Mike called from a friend's house and told me he was coming over to have some fun. For the next three days we were a little more open to each other than usual except that it didn't take much more time for me be ready to let him watch or do anything I wanted with my vagina. After all, he had fucked me in the ass and I had let him have a finger up that hole. We were just having fun but I was always able to get really turned on when I used the bathroom or when I washed my vagina.</p> <p>The first person to arrive at our apartment was the same guy that I had made an appointment with for my new friend's appointment that day. It was the only one I really saw. The other person was a guy who had taken my girlfriend all the way to our apartment. It seemed that my friend had just arrived and they hadn't been together in a long time. The guy looked around for an instant and then walked over. As he moved the other person toward me I turned and smiled at him as I handed him the small box. He looked at it and then picked it up and handed it to me. â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
