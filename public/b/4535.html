I want to see it." I moved forward, taking her hand and placing it on my cock.</p> <p>Katie moved her hand along its length, and felt my hardness. She then started to fondle my balls while rubbing my cock head, which was now fully hard.</p> <p>"Mmmm," Katie moaned, "that feels nice. " Then she started to stroke my cock.</p> <p>"Now fuck me," I said into her ear. "It's time for your reward."</p> <p>She reached back and spread her ass cheeks. I guided my cock head to her hole, and pushed. She grunted, so I stopped, and then pushed harder.</p> <p>Katie had a firm hold of my prick, and pushed back onto it. "This is it," she cried softly. "It's time for that reward."</p> <p>The head of my cock slipped inside her ass. With each stroke we would pull out, but never leave it there. Katie wanted it to remain inside as much as possible.</p> <p>I watched Katie's ass as we continued to stroke ourselves together. I was still fully erect; she had me fully erect. She was so tight around my prick; she was hot and wet, and I was so hard.</p> <p>Katie was moaning on a regular basis. Then she pushed it forward. I was almost out of the way, just pushing myself into her.</p> <p>"Fuck" she cried, holding herself and keeping pace with me.</p> <p>Suddenly she grunted and tensed suddenly. I stopped in shock.</p> <p>"Fuck," Katie whimpered, "fuck. " Again and again she strained, until she couldn't take it any longer.</p> <p>"It's all in the past," I said, not believing what was happening.</p> <p>"Don't mind if it's all in the past," she said, and turned around and got in the 69 position on her hands and knees.</p> <p>We each resumed stroking ourselves as she had done before, and she reached her hand down and started to stroke me with her hand again.</p> <p>Suddenly, she stopped licking to say, "I want to do you some more."</p> <p>I took her right hand and brought it back to my prick, which was now ready for more. With my hand guiding her hand, I put two fingers into her ass. As she continued to stroke me, I started to ease in and withdraw slowly again.</p> <p>Katie was whimpering now. I pushed into her ass slowly a couple of times, and watched it stretch and open some more. Katie moaned lightly as I took her hand and started stroking myself.</p> <p>"What's next?" she said, "next?"</p> <p>When I put my hand to her tit, she seemed to like it. In her position, I was able to caress her nipple, which was hard again under my fingers.</p> <p>Again, I pulled my prick back slowly and pushed it forward slightly. This time, she grunted and started to moan again. Her moans were muffled, but a hint of a whisper.</p> <p>"What!" was all we could say.</p> <p>In reply, she began to run her hand slowly along the underside of my prick. Her hand was a blur, her fingers moving easily, and I couldn't control my breathing.</p> <p>I continued to stroke my cock, and soon it felt as if it was a rock. We continued slowly for a bit, then suddenly pulled out and held one another.</p> <p>This time, she pulled me down a bit to kiss her, her breath coming in gasps. Our lips were still locked together, and she held tightly onto me with her arms.</p> <p>We moved until we were against a wall, with our backs against it. We were still holding each other tightly. I ran my hands down her back. It seemed to be the first time we were naked in each other's presence. We had never been so close. As we stood there, I kissed her one last time and then pulled her close into me.</p> <p>We looked at each other for a bit, and then turned around to face the wall again.</p> <p>"You did this to me?" she said softly. "When we first started here I was afraid I would never be good enough."</p> <p>"I couldn't believe what we did," I replied. I pulled her close on my side. There was a feeling of calm about the two of us that I hadn't felt in years.</p> <p>"I was worried that if I hurt you, I might lose you," she said. "But, I was glad we went ahead with this." She kissed me lightly on the lipsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
