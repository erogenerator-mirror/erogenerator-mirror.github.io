He said as he kissed the tip of her nose.</p> <p>As she drifted off to sleep she wondered, "How long would he be taking?"</p> <p>********************</p> <p>He awoke just after seven a.m. He was in the kitchen taking things out. He heard the shower running by the open door. He walked into the bathroom and was shocked to see Jessica asleep on his bed. He quickly got undressed and slipped in beside her. He was instantly aroused by the naked beauty of her body but he was not sure if it was not his erection in his shorts that was the problem. He kissed her face and lips then kissed her lips and her eyes until she kissed him back, sucking on his lips, moving her tongue deep inside his mouth and pulling him close. After the love making they just held each other and the kissing continued, their hands playing with each other's bodies and occasionally pinching nipples. But nothing else happened until after she was done and asked him to shower.</p> <p>She dressed in her underwear and was getting ready to go, "I have been waiting for you." she said to him as the spray of water hit his chest splashing from every angle.</p> <p>"Yes I have and have been waiting for you. Are you going to come in?" he said as she walked out of the shower.</p> <p>"Well, I've been here for about an hour and I thought I heard Jessica come in. It was definitely not a man knocking on your door."</p> <p>"Well it is certainly not a man." he said playfully and looked to see a pair of shorts on the floor where she had thrown hers.</p> <p>"I guess you should wear it and don't you think it looks good on you?" she said as she picked up the shorts and tossed it in his face.</p> <p>"Hmmm, I'd be happy to. Maybe that's why I have your bra and panties on, well let me try them then." they began their shower.</p> <p>He put the bra and panties on and then took the panties and slipped them on. He looked at the pair of shorts and pulled them up on his legs, they were a little tight and he felt a little awkward as he pulled them higher up on his skin. They made him feel a little silly, but not as awkward as he would feel if he had to pull the underwear on at the gym, or walk down stairs into the men's locker room wearing the shorts from the day before. As he looked at them he could see he was a big man with a nice body, but no body parts. He would find out what she liked in a few months.</p> <p>After his shower they dressed in their clothes and walked downstairs. The house was empty except for some food and drink waiting for their guests. It was a beautiful spring day. The house lit up like a full moon. It was lovely to see a couple going thru the garden. The sky was overcast and they saw the light of the evening coming in through the window. He and Jessica went outside to see what kind of entertainment was going on, and there were plenty of people out on their patio. It appeared to be the middle of the afternoon for that part of the day. A large circle of people were sitting on a deck sipping beer.</p> <p>Jessie was wearing a sheer white robe over her body in a very revealing way and it barely came down enough to hide her breasts. She could see he male attention was on her too. There was a couple sitting on a big double chaise lounge with glasses of beer or wine in hand. There were two young men sitting on the other side of the chaise. His back was to them but he was talking to them.</p> <p>Jessica was wearing a light teddy. The outfit was short and showed off her long legs. The robe parted a little so he could see the lower portion of her white panties. Both men were looking at her breasts. She made some sort of comment while sitting down and he tried to hide his erection. She looked to her left and he could almost see his wife's breasts out in the room. He could make out her nipples pointing at him. The men had made sure they had glasses of wine to calm their erections so she wouldn't get a cold.</p> <p>He noticed her husband move in closer to her. She looked around the room to see if he was being heard and saw herself in the mirror. He could not have been more embarrassed if he hadn't seen Jessica. He felt it was time to go outside on his own. They walked down the stairs into the backyard. He felt a little awkward when he walked around and she had the patio door open but he had no idea how he was going to get away with it. After the backyard and the courtyard he turned off the lights in the kitchen and walked back outside with a cooler carrying his food.
