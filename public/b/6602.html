What do you say?"</p> <p>"That's a good plan. I think I can help you get to sleep." I smiled.</p> <p>"Sure you can."</p> <p>"Let me know if you need anything", I said as I put a hand on her knee and leaned in close to her. She looked up at me briefly and then turned her head and smiled.</p> <p>"I'm Jessica... and you are?" She laughed, "Well, I guess we can get to sleep and I can help you get to sleep."</p> <p>"Yeah, me either." I replied.</p> <p>"You can, but please, give me a call whenever you want to... and I think I can help." She said as her leg went up on my lap. I put a hand on her shoulder.</p> <p>"You're not too old to hang on. We'll see if we don't help each other" I joked. Jessica grinned and reached her hand right over my knee.</p> <p>She stopped laughing and looked around a bit.</p> <p>"How's your apartment?"</p> <p>"A little different, but still good."</p> <p>"It was not really a job, but I could use a good job."</p> <p>"Yeah. I'd like that."</p> <p>I had a little surprise.</p> <p>We got to work, and I didn't even bother paying her anything. The rest went on just for fun.</p> <p>She did work for me. Jessica was a pretty good-looking girl, but she had to be around 50 and her body was a little more on the skinny side, but she wore it pretty damn well. Even my girlfriend couldn't take her eyes off her chest. On the nights she didn't want any attention, she'd strip right in front of me and my friend's mom and she was just great. I was sure the girls wouldn't take much notice, but she sure could.</p> <p>Jessica's family was a pretty small group of people, and she didn't care. She had all of the advantages of being married to some good looking guy, but even then it was hard since she had her share of girls, especially since she wasn't interested in anyone but herself. She didn't want to break up a relationship between a married couple and her, either, but she could at times just enjoy a good conversation between friends.</p> <p>Jessica was not as good of a friend as her husband, but still had her good looks and was a nice looking woman. I had no problem being friendly, but I felt uncomfortable around Jessica as she was a lot older than me. But what really bothered me then was when Jessica came into my shop. She had a little makeup on and the clothes I was buying were nice; but what really bothered me was that she was staring at me with a smile. It looked like she was really getting aroused with the effect she was having on me. It wasn't lost on me that she was trying out different clothes that she wasn't trying out at least. It wasn't helping it that she was so easy to read and could easily feel a nervousness in how she looked. She just had a way of looking into me, especially a look that was sexy as hell and I was having a hard time ignoring the fact that she really was attracted to me. Jessica hadn't been very outgoing for the past couple years. The fact was that I wasn't just a girl, and that the majority of what her friends came out with was just sexual. I actually believed that. A lot of people say that it wasn't just a good look, that it was just sex, but the truth is that her friends wouldn't really be like that. They really didn't know what you were looking at or who you were looking at, only that you looked at others and they didn't give a shit. Well they did, though.</p> <p>"I'm Jessica by the way", I said as I stood up to shake her hand and I made no effort to hide my excitement or the fact that I had actually been hoping to hug her, "How are you getting home?"</p> <p>Jessica smiled.</p> <p>"I get home just as late as everyone thinks. I've tried to work on everything, but that just doesn't seem to be going and there's too much time wasted. Sometimes I forget that I have to work a shift at all but I don't really feel like working, either. It's hard to get in that much ahead of the kids, sometimes I just forgot that something was wrong and it's not as much fun as I'm used to."</p> <p>"What about your son?"</p> <p>"His mom and I broke up a couple weeks ago because he's never been home enough." Jessica's face lit up.</p> <p>"That's pretty cool, is there anything I can do to help you?" I askedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
