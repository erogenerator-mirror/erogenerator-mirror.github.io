You're not." He said it as a joke for some reason. But when he laughed at me he didn't realize it was coming so hard. I was shocked. I started backing up towards him just to stop this. "You know, I can have sex with men in a hundred different ways, and you wouldn't think I want to hear about every day. I don't even understand what that's all about." It hurt, and it really turned me on, and he said that now was not the time. "And I'd do anything to get with you."</p> <p>"Anything?"</p> <p>A little more forcefully he answered, "Anything" so fast I almost missed the question that was going to occur, "What do you would do if I had sex with a woman?" I'm not sure why I said it, but I did. I told him a few things that were out of my comfort zone for so long, but that he would probably think if I had to ask him something the moment he asked it. So, I said, "Well, I think I could have sex with you. I mean if it was just between people, I'd have sex with you too. It was so hot we could have that. You're much nicer than the rest of these guys, they're all right."</p> <p>He didn't know what to say. He didn't understand, but, the more I thought about it the more it turned me on. I had no plans to fuck another man. It would be wrong and it would hurt a lot of people. Maybe I should have gone for it. He was the one who asked me to go with him, and I accepted it. It would have been wrong and it would have hurt even less.</p> <p>This was my last day with Matt, and I was starting to regret it. I was so excited. I couldn't stand it no matter how hard I had to think about it. I finally got up, and left his office without making a big deal about it. It seemed really stupid and stupid, but I didn't even care. Matt must have noticed, because he always took my hand and led me to his door.</p> <p>"I haven't seen you in a week, and there's still a week before I can do anything."</p> <p>I didn't even acknowledge that was true, but I gave it a bit, and he seemed to love it even after the day. I told him I could call in sick later to be with him. He said that wouldn't be a problem and that sounded like a lot of fun. I made a note in my mind to make this last month my only priority. As soon as I got to the store I went back into the rest area and got a box of vibrating eggs for the guys.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" Matt asked. He didn't understand what I had in mind. "Let's try this!" I said and started getting it ready, which of course, he didn't understand. He couldn't imagine taking a vibrating egg from me. "Let me take it out." He was still dumbfounded.</p> <p>"I can't."</p> <p>"So can I. They're still vibrating."</p> <p>My hands were still shaking so much I almost had to run out the store to get them. I made my way back to Matt, and took the eggs out. "I thought these worked. You really should try them. That way nothing between them would be stuck."</p> <p>"I can't."</p> <p>"Look, get out. I had a long talk with you."</p> <p>"How did you talk with me?"</p> <p>"I asked if you'd mind if I was on the phone with you. I have to know if you might be able to take care of that for me. You know you really shouldn't be fucking girls anymore."</p> <p>I took his hand and led him out of the store. For the next few hours I was nervous and confused, and Matt was not much of an actor. He really wasn't a great actor either, but we could both learn from this. One of our favorite ways to get sex was to kiss and tell each other how you wanted it. I know it's really stupid, but you might as well let me be the first one to take you on. We didn't get it right and he really didn't know how to ask me. Maybe I should have asked. I can make it up to him I think. I really would.</p> <p>When we got back to our room he tried to act normal with me, but inside he was just like always. It took about two miles to get through the first hour of our marriage, and one hour since we had our first break from all of that. It never felt right not to go over to his room and tell him I was tired and neededâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
