"I love the way you can just come at me in that sexy way."</p> <p>"Yeah, you think so?" I asked her.</p> <p>Kitty stood up and started to put on her new, white tank top which gave me a view down her top.</p> <p>She put the top on over those massive knockers.</p> <p>"They're not nearly as big as Mandy, but they will be fun," Kitty teased me, "just for a change."</p> <p>Kitty lifted her feet up onto the step. This gave me a good view down her top to her amazing tits. They were just begging to be touched. As she turned around I was getting a little aroused at the prospect of touching her tits.</p> <p>Kitty turned back to me and asked me to join her into the bathroom. I slipped into the hot tub and sat there soaking myself as Kitty poured some wine into a glass and sat it down for us.</p> <p>I sat back as I felt Kitty's sexy foot wrap around my cock and slowly start to stroke it up and down.</p> <p>Kitty looked up at me. I looked down at her foot as it continued to caress my cock and I reached over and held her foot in my hands for a moment. I could feel her toes tickling against the head as she continued to stroke my cock.</p> <p>Kitty looked over at me again. I noticed her hand on her nipples as I continued to stroke my cock. I leaned around her so that I could kiss her lips tenderly, my tongue sliding easily into her mouth and she moaned as our tongues continued to dance inside each others mouths.</p> <p>I broke our lips off and stood up. I was very turned on by the sight of my sexy, hot wife standing there stroking herself. Kitty sat down so she could watch her hand play with her pussy and I stood up so I could get a better look at her. We both looked at each other and I knew that I wanted to make this woman in front of me come as much as I did now. I leaned over and kissed her on the lips, our tongues dancing between our kiss. I pulled back to look at her smiling face.</p> <p>"Are you ready for the next stage of this evening?" I asked.</p> <p>Kitty nodded enthusiastically.</p> <p>We each took another sip of wine watching each other masturbate ourselves. I sat back down so that my cock was right in front of Kitty's legs. There was a slight ache between her legs from me leaning over her and she had to have placed my cock right in front of her.</p> <p>"Kitty, you are the most sexy woman that I have ever been with as you came to me to meet you this evening. I love being with you." I told her, "and there are a lot of things we can do together that make me so happy."</p> <p>"So you like being with me?" Kitty asked as she started giggling again.</p> <p>"Yeah," I smiled at her, "and having you as a friend."</p> <p>"You think I should?" Kitty asked.</p> <p>I saw that she had another idea. We both rose a little in the bubbling water and then sat next to each other on the steps of the hot tub. We kissed again and this time I stroked her hand as she sat on the edge of the tub with her legs wrapped around my waist. This was what I thought we were going to do next.</p> <p>Both of our legs were wet from the steaming water.</p> <p>"Kitty, is there something you want from me?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Well, I've thought about doing this since I came out here last spring and I think I've got the idea." Kitty stated.</p> <p>"You know, you're the only man that I've ever been with." I replied.</p> <p>"Yea, you're the only man I've been with that has ever been with a black man." she said.</p> <p>"Would you do it if you were with a white man?" I asked her.</p> <p>I felt my heart beat a little faster at this thought.</p> <p>"Would you do it if you were not with a white man?" I asked her.</p> <p>Kitty took another sip of wine.</p> <p>"Are you sure you're okay with this?" she asked.</p> <p>"I'm sure of it," I replied.</p> <p>I took in her face.</p> <p>"This isn't like us meeting on a trip or anything, but as far as I'm concerned it is just a way of getting the time together that I need to come to you. I just wanted to invite you out to dinner and then you come back to me..." I said.</p> <p>Kitty took another sip and turned towardsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
