His hand began to stroke her clitoris with urgency now as his penis felt her pussy contract around it. The orgasm was upon them now. She felt hot cum begin to explode deep inside her, and she was not ready for its explosion to end yet. The two lovers were completely oblivious to the fact that they had just experienced an orgasm of their own, and as each orgasm continued to sweep over their bodies, so too did the climax of the other's orgasm, and they began to grunt with passion and release their passion. Finally they collapsed in each other's arms, feeling the energy of their orgasms, and drifted off to sleep in each other's arms.</p> <p>The following Wednesday, I felt rather frustrated when my wife of two years asked if she could come to see me again. I could not refuse and agreed. We went our separate ways, and she returned to the college, and I received a call later that week from her. She invited me back to her room, and again I accepted. She had been out with a friend, and decided to meet me in a hotel she was visiting. We met at a bar-room and she ordered me a drink, and we went to a corner booth. There would probably be no hard feelings, but still it felt wrong to talk about this so soon.</p> <p>As we were talking I began to think about what our next meeting may be, and what sort of "date" was going to be. As we were having a drink, she asked, "Steve, do you think we could maybe get together and go together again?"</p> <p>I told her I do not think that could happen, and thought she asked nicely, but I said maybe, she thought maybe, I do think and the question I asked was: Does Steve and I really think about a date?</p> <p>She looked up and smiled and said very seriously, "Steve, I have thought about it for years, and if it happens, maybe, but have never thought that we should set out to fulfill that desire."</p> <p>My own face dropped and I thought to myself: "I will never see that happen."</p> <p>This was not an easy conversation, but it was not my job to determine the answer. I think I must have looked hurt. "I told you, wouldn't you like to have a really serious talk about having an honest date?"</p> <p>She looked relieved and said, "You know it's not all what you think. I only meant having a real date tonight."</p> <p>I told her that was fine. She smiled and said that maybe a good time in the morning would be good too, then she kissed me on the cheek and we went our separate ways again.</p> <p>The next morning I felt as if I had been thrown out on a wild impulse for two years. My mind told me that maybe this was a good opportunity to pursue a serious relationship with a girl-girl; the thought of being alone with the opportunity of her friend and her would soon be enough to start a new and very serious relationship! I just couldn't shake the guilt that I thought of when I was alone with her. But I knew I would have to be there with her for that evening if the opportunity arose.</p> <p>On the other hand, what I had not thought of were the thoughts of being with a girl-girl. I had never really considered such a possibility. And I thought about that very much last night. It all seemed very unreal. That night it didn't happen. So I had to come up with a different approach. I wasn't sure I could have done that myself, or would I ever again be interested in a girl-girl if the chance ever arose. I would now know what to do. I decided that for the first time since the beginning of my life, to go out with my friend and have a serious date with a girl-girl was not too bad.</p> <p>As I prepared to go, I decided to take a trip to St. Charles, rather at noon. I had my first date with a girl, and it seemed so exciting. I had been with a couple of girlfriends on our first dates, as it was the first time I had gone out alone with a girl-girl. But the girls I had been with were never girls-girl types; at least that is my opinion on the matter.</p> <p>I had already reserved a hotel room a few blocks away, with a view of the ocean; and that hotel room was just off of it. The time to be available to me was at 1:30am when I arrived. It was not surprising that the hotel had that moment when I walked through the key-code pad to enter the room. It was a fairly spacious room with a king-size four-poster bed justâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
