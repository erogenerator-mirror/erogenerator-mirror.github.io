"I'm going to do whatever you want."</p> <p>"And what if we do it without getting a hard-on?" he demanded.</p> <p>"I have to," I protested, "I get to do things for you, and I get to do stuff for you," I stated. "And you have to tell me what I've been missing."</p> <p>"Not on your life," he insisted. "You're a bad girl. I'm not going to punish you, unless you do something silly."</p> <p>"You can't be serious," I said.</p> <p>"And I'm sorry for that," he shot back. "No one is sorry for saying a bad thing. Especially on your birthday."</p> <p>His logic was flawed, but it was true – he had a hard time being serious.</p> <p>He made his way into the house. I wasn't as comfortable as I had been when I had left it that morning – although I had barely got the chance to talk to anyone. I couldn't seem to make up my mind about what was expected.</p> <p>In my imagination, my first encounter with Mike was everything I had been looking for. His thick cock sliding easily inside my achingly wet cunt as my fingers curled around his thighs. His hands tugging painfully at my breasts, his rough nipples stretching tight between our fingers, his fingers pinching mine.</p> <p>His voice was quiet, distant, almost to the point of being inaudible. "When you're done you'll have to suck me off, my dirty girl?" he asked. "I haven't been there for many days," he added. It took a moment for the memory of him to register.</p> <p>"No, I don't want to do that. If I did that, you'd have to stop me from coming," I pleaded with him. "I'm sorry; I'm such a good girl. I get it sometimes."</p> <p>"Yeah," he agreed. "That's it. That, when you're getting to do naughty things with your dirty pussy. It makes me feel like you're more beautiful than you already are. I'm trying so hard to keep up with you."</p> <p>In my imagination, his cock was so hard, I was sure it would soon explode at any moment. I didn't even get the chance to say I was sorry again. The moment Mike opened my door, I knew the next time I would have his cock deep in my mouth, not just in the car.</p> <p>That night, my head was swimming. I couldn't even think about my date with Mike. In fact, I began to regret it. I tried to rationalise his feelings, but it was as if they were coming from my own heart.</p> <p>For some reason I craved the taste of cock. My mouth was watering when it came.</p> <p>Mike opened the door when the time arrived. Our kiss was long and sweet. My body ached when he lifted me into his arms. His chest was hot against my bare flesh as our bodies pressed tightly together. He whispered to my ear, "You can do it too."</p> <p>"I don't know if I can."</p> <p>"You want this," he whispered seductively. "Then you can do this." He slid his hand down my body to the crease of my arse. I was sure I was on the verge of coming, but I held off. I wanted to watch him fuck me.</p> <p>In my imagination, Mike's cock was already deep inside me on my bed, and I wondered if my virgin, young body could take it. I heard him gasp at the sight of my tight young pussy engulfing his hardness. My hands were still in constant motion as they wrapped around his thighs, his balls, moving up and down his shaft.</p> <p>As my fantasy reached its crescendo, I felt my body tense. Mike's hand moved faster.</p> <p>"Stop! Please!" I pleaded, "I just need a few minutes to calm down."</p> <p>"Are you sure?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yeah!" I said breathlessly as my body began to shiver with the anticipation of what I sensed would happen. I felt Mike's hand tighten on my breast. My back arched as I screamed silently. A small tremor ran through me as my orgasm overcame me. My body trembled with a wave of release. I knew I had never been this vulnerable to Mike again, as he had with my body.</p> <p>Mike didn't need a second invite. With his hand still on my breast, he slowly dragged his body up my body as he lay atop me. With one gentle leg on each side of mine, he lay with his head on the pillow, his mouth seeking my lips. I could already feel him hard—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
