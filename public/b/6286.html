She was not in a state to fight my attack. I slipped my hands back inside her jacket, grabbed the back of her knees and slid her skirt up her thighs and exposed her smooth pussy. I slid my finger through her slick lips into her wetness as I pushed it deep into her. She was breathing hard but her eyes were still trying to focus on the road in front of her. She was soaking, as much as I like it. I withdrew my finger for a second and then slid it back in. I began stroking her pussy at the same pace she was pumping up and down my cock. In the opposite spot there was more friction. The driver was grunting every time he drove forward at an angle. She had one other hand in her lap, playing with her breast as she squeezed her breasts. My finger continued its work in her, and as it reached the crest of her orgasm she began to buck and groan loudly into the car. She stiffened and moaned as a long spasm overcame her.</p> <p>"Oh. Fuck. I'm coming."</p> <p>She leaned forward on her seat, trying to breathe. She released a long gasp, panting hard and breathing heavily. She had one last shudder before she collapsed into the back seat. Her face was flushed and her chest was heaving as she let out another loud squeal of pleasure.</p> <p>"What do we do now?" she asked me.</p> <p>"I want both of us to come together," I answered. "We need to wait until tomorrow for next stop to go to the next one."</p> <p>We talked a while longer before she gave me a playful slap on the thigh to let me know she was coming to a stop. I was right. She was. We pulled into the next stop for the next stop. The place turned out to be quite lively, with people milling around. I had my arm around her as we waited. We chatted happily as we drove. We had the entire town to ourselves. The next stop was actually a little busier, but it was relatively quiet. She pulled me up with her and we shared a quick kiss from across the street. Our hands were on each other from my seat on to hers from behind. She was on her way by herself as she parked and looked the other direction. We talked about her day along with the scenery, including her plans to work with her new job and the things she had had to do to make ends meet.</p> <p>We enjoyed our talk, enjoying being in a public place where we could express ourselves to each other in whatever way we saw fit. She was clearly eager to tell me all about her days. I was glad to hear she was interested in my job and that I would be able to help her out the same as myself. She smiled at me when she had finished and we resumed the conversation back at the stop. We agreed to meet again at a small café later that night and we would go back to my place. We agreed that we could start a plan to meet when she got back from work tomorrow.</p> <p>The next stop was a new place. It was quiet and was a little run-down, but it was not the worst area I could say. We parked and went in to the café to have a drink. I took off my jacket and sat down at a table, sipping on a beer. We chatted about everything under the sun and enjoyed having lunch with the place. There were a lot more people and I started talking about my job as if I were a regular and how I planned on getting the job. It got a bit awkward, so I broke off the conversation.</p> <p>"So, what are you looking for?" she asked me.</p> <p>"I think I want to find out if we're going to be compatible as partners."</p> <p>"So you really do want to find out, right?"</p> <p>"Sure, I do. What about you?"</p> <p>"I want a partner and that may not be a problem. For now; it's going to be our secret."</p> <p>There was an awkward pause as I asked her about her current job. Then she did not bother with words. She gave me the same answer that I asked myself in return.</p> <p>"I'll do things for you, just like you did for me in the beginning."</p> <p>I was surprised and turned on by my sister's openness, but I wasn't about to stop her and what we had to do, so I asked her to go on a date to my place. She was not happy about the idea, but she was not ready to give me her number either. She looked at me intently for a minute and then she agreed with me. We made plans to meet up for lunch later. I made my way home to shower and change, followed by an early dinner as I was—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
