I could hear the strain in his voice.</p> <p>"It's not what?" I asked.</p> <p>"That I was...fucked by a black man...by my mother...to a porn star...that I'd be jealous that a black man..."</p> <p>He looked at me with a puzzled expression.</p> <p>"You're beautiful," I said. "You're sexy."</p> <p>"What do you think?" I asked.</p> <p>I looked into his eyes, seeing the sincerity there. "How you make me feel when you're with me," he said. I kissed him, tasting the saltiness of his lipstick. "I love you, too. And I never stopped loving you from the moment we met. It was a dream come true."</p> <p>He laughed. "Let me go change," he said. "But I don't have any condoms."</p> <p>"Neither do I."</p> <p>We kissed and left the bedroom.</p> <p>I had been with women before. And I think I was the only one of my gender in love of men. But I certainly loved them.</p> <p>We went down to the bar while everyone else came in the room, which was a pleasant experience, for both of us. The bar was crowded, and the loud music made it feel crowded.</p> <p>"Is your lover gay?" I asked one of the women in the band. She grinned at me and shook her head. I laughed.</p> <p>"My God, you should have seen that look on his face when he came over on Sunday," I said. "The look on his face when you kissed his cheek for him, or that other girl in the band. I'm sure he's been doing them," I said, referring to the stripper who sat on the edge of the stage right outside the door. She laughed and looked at me. I was sure she did, too.</p> <p>I kissed her. "We'll go get him," I said. "That he can be with us."</p> <p>"I don't have any condoms," she said.</p> <p>"Let him," I said. She smiled. The band played the song that she had been about to play. She held my hand, so I took her out on the balcony and danced with her. She laughed and danced with me for a short time until she pulled away.</p> <p>"You and him," she said, giggling.</p> <p>We danced together for another minute. "Let's go into the bedroom," I said. The women laughed again.</p> <p>I led her into the bedroom and I sat on the edge of the bed. She came and stood before me.</p> <p>"You'll love me," she said, and with two tears running down her face, she turned around to look me in the face. "You'll be my lover, and I'll be your woman. Just give us space."</p> <p>"This won't do," I said. I took her hand. "It could."</p> <p>She led me to the bed, gently, slowly, with long, tender kisses, and when our lips touched, I was lost.</p> <p>When my lips touched hers, it was like she was my lover. We kissed for what seemed like forever. When all three of us finally found our own feet, I sat on the edge of the bed and reached for the clasp, which was on her bra. She let me pull it down, and her breasts were bare to my view. She held the cups of the bra by her nipples, and lifted them up to my nostrils. They were full and pink. She took one finger and pulled them away from her and showed me the pink tip of one nipple, which was very hard. I kissed her nipple and she sighed.</p> <p>We kissed again, and slowly, carefully, carefully, I brought my lips to hers. When I touched her, she pushed my head away.</p> <p>"Let me go," she said.</p> <p>I pulled her down, and lay on top of her. She laid back, watching me. I kissed her, and my tongue touched hers. I moved my lips onto hers, and touched her with my tongue. She laughed when I licked her, and I kissed her more deeply. I pushed my thigh between hers, separating them. She lifted her knees, and I found their way open. I rubbed my leg against hers, and I slid my thigh between hers a little.</p> <p>"Are you going to fuck me?" she asked.</p> <p>I nodded.</p> <p>"Are you going to fuck me," she repeated.</p> <p>"I'm not going to fuck you."</p> <p>"Just because I tell you to," she said.</p> <p>I slid my thigh between hers a little wider as she said it. When my thigh touched hers, she lifted her knees to try to get me closerâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
