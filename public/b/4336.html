She said as, after a brief pause, she turned away and got out of bed. She pulled the covers back and reached up to touch him, but he stepped away.</p> <p>"You're too small," She said, looking over her shoulder at the ceiling.</p> <p>"It's okay, Honey. In the warm sunlight it's more comfortable than it is in the cold of winter." He smiled, sitting on the bed.</p> <p>"Now where were we? Oh, I forgot to mention, I'm in my underwear drawer." She stepped on the bed, and he moved to stand in front of her. She watched him as she slowly undid his shorts, exposing his erect penis standing proud from his loincloth. He stepped out of them, and tossed aside his clothing, leaving him standing in his underwear.</p> <p>"I want to see you with your back to me," She said, kneeling behind him.</p> <p>"No, please, I'd rather that." He said it almost pleadingly, as his hands closed over the back of her head. He pulled her face against his groin, pushing himself against it gently. Her arms were around his waist, her breasts pressed against his buttocks as his erection slid between her thighs. He reached down, grabbed the bottom of her blouse and pulled her hands off his waist.</p> <p>"This isn't the right thing to do," He said, as he pulled her arms off and quickly pulled up her shirt. She helped him, wriggling her arms free from her blouse, and slid it off, tossing it aside. She slid down to her knees, facing him, and held her breath for a second.</p> <p>When he pulled up her shirt, the straps at her shoulders fell from her face, falling back over both her hands.</p> <p>"Not again?" He asked, kissing her neck, his hands coming up and caressing her breasts.</p> <p>"Not in time."</p> <p>"Too soon, sweetheart." He said, kissing the small of her back as he moved her to the bed, then laid her down with a pillow behind her head. She lay there, waiting as he moved off the bed, and knelt beside the bed, his fingers pulling at her nipples. Her body responded to his touch, responding to the attention he paid to her breasts.</p> <p>He took his time, kneeling by her side, as he began his slow undressing of her. She sighed as he drew his shirt off over his head, and when her hands began to caress his chest, his hands moved down her body. He began to kiss her upper back, just below her shoulder, as her hands moved up and over his abs. She let a moan escape the corner of her mouth as he licked, kissed and nibbled at her breasts. She moaned even more when he moved up to her neck and began to kiss and suck on her as he stood above her kissing her.</p> <p>"You're the luckiest little slut ever." He said, softly kissing each ear before moving up to hers.</p> <p>She was startled at first, until he whispered for her to turn over. She turned over again, and he moved over her so that his legs were between hers. She felt it as he held a firm grip on her, as his face drew closer to hers. He pressed a kiss to her lips, and pulled herself back again with his hands. She felt her wetness slide down her legs the second his mouth was placed over hers. All of her nerve endings were firing at the same time as she felt him slip himself into her. He began to move in and out in long strokes, with short, quick plunges. The sensation of sliding her slickness over his cock was exquisite, as were the soft, feathery, caressing caresses it sent into her body. She cried out as she felt herself being rolled over by his hands, while keeping herself turned on.</p> <p>His hard body pressed against her and her arms and legs held him tightly as his cock rubbed against her clit. She felt another explosion building in her belly as he held himself back so that she couldn't move.</p> <p>"I'm coming!" He shouted, and his body shuddered again as he emptied himself into her. He lay there for a minute as he finished his deep, slow strokes. He slid out, not wanting to leave. His erection was still hard, and he pulled it out of her, then moved on top of her, spreading her legs wide apart. Using the towel he had tossed on the bed beside her bed, he covered their bodies with it, leaving his wet cock in her. He was still hard as well and he began entering her again. It was slow, but they both enjoyed it as he continued fucking her. She could feel herself tensing and tightening around him.
