I'll stay until the sun comes up, and then I should head off. After you're there, I'll take you home."</p> <p>"Yeah, yeah, I guess I should..."</p> <p>"Good! You'll just have to make up for it later." He smiled and waved his hand in front of her face. "Come on. You'll be happy to meet me."</p> <p>And if it wasn't for the fact that they were both naked, he'd have left her there. She couldn't help but shudder at the thought of losing him.</p> <p>*** Chapter 9: "The Dream's Over! ***</p> <p>When she awoke a few hours later he was gone, and she wasn't in the bed he left her in. She groggily pulled out the pillow, but no trace of it was on it. She pulled the sheet down and gasped. A large, thick dildo was dangling from her fingers. It wasn't a real cock, not really.</p> <p>"It must be that," she muttered. "Must have come from him."</p> <p>It was a fake cildo, and it was the only real one she'd ever had, although on more than one occasion with one of her girlfriends. Other than that though, if was the real thing she used it, and there was a real one. And for some reason it hadn't bothered her. What made something so big, so real? And it had come from someone who could read her body language and read her mind.</p> <p>She pulled on her panties, pulled on her sweats and panties, and climbed out of bed, but she thought she'd better stay. She found the dildo.</p> <p>"Good morning," she said. "Can I give you a hand?" She stepped into the bathroom and pulled the mirror over her eyes. She frowned. "He still has that dildo up his ass, so I guess we need to make some room for it." "Sure, let me get some toiletries out of the dresser." She headed out into the spare bedroom, past her brother-in-law - who was the same one she'd had with Mr. Miller - and into the downstairs bedroom, where there was a double bed he had converted to a bed. He made the bed, where it fit him perfectly, and she turned on the light in his bathroom to see a fresh, clean-looking face.</p> <p>"Good morning," she said. "Good morning." She walked to him. "Can I get you something to eat?"</p> <p>"Yeah, if you want." He stood up, his eyes on her appreciatively. "I guess I'm hungry."</p> <p>She laughed. She remembered the time they had been fucking in his apartment. They had fucked in the bedroom, on the desk, in his desk chair. She had come home feeling very slutty. It was then that he had come into her head. That had been the only time any woman could come from him. Had it not been for his big hands, which were always under control, it would never have been a problem. She didn't mind. It actually became part of fucking with him, which she always didâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
