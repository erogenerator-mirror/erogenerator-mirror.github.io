"Are you ready for breakfast yet?" he said as he approached me.</p> <p>I could have killed this man.</p> <p>"Coming," I called back.</p> <p>He walked slowly past me towards the kitchen, carrying his shirt in a wide, black sleeve.</p> <p>My eyes followed him as he moved toward the bathroom door.</p> <p>"You're going to the kitchen," I joked as I closed the door.</p> <p>"And I'm going upstairs to make up some breakfast," he added as I watched his butt sway in step, leading me up the stairs to the bedroom.</p> <p>My mind raced with visions of what he might be wearing as I entered the master bedroom.</p> <p>I looked to my right as his bedroom door opened and in walked Michael. He wore a black and pink robe with a short black skirt and white t-shirt.</p> <p>Michael walked in through his bedroom door after pulling the robe off of himself.</p> <p>"Good morning," I walked in after him.</p> <p>"Good morning to you," he smiled with a smile that said nothing, as if it meant nothing.</p> <p>Michael turned to the side so I could look at his muscular, tan shoulders and back as he walked towards the bed. He then moved to the center of the bed and dropped his robe off to the side exposing his perfectly smooth and muscular legs and his neatly trimmed bush complete with no hair to hinder me view of his package. My eyes took in his body and I quickly noticed that my eyes moved to his feet and then his dick.</p> <p>"I couldn't keep my eyes off this one," I said to myself feeling embarrassed, which made me smile.</p> <p>Michael walked up to me and he put his arms around me and kissed me long and deep. I was getting wet just watching him and he kissed me deep.</p> <p>"I need a shower," he whispered into my ear and turned me over to face him.</p> <p>I could feel him rubbing his crotch against my leg.</p> <p>"I can get out of the shower if you want," he said to me as his lips neared my neck.</p> <p>I just moved my lower body to allow him to reach my upper body. Michael turned me and moved up on to the bed and spread my legs wide.</p> <p>"You really know how to take charge," he whispered as he lowered himself to my pussy.</p> <p>I lifted my legs to his shoulders and he began his delicious assault on my pussy and clit.</p> <p>I began moaning as Michael worked his way towards my clit and I felt his tongue slide gently back over my pussy lips.</p> <p>"You got me so hot," he whispered as he reached my clit and began to lightly lick it.</p> <p>"I love to watch you when you cum," he kissed the top of my mound as he did this. "I couldn't contain myself," he moaned as he continued to lick and eat my pussy as he moved his finger on my clit back to it.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum again," I shouted over and over loudly.</p> <p>I felt him slide his finger into my pussy deep and then he licked my clit.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum," I screamed as I came on his face.</p> <p>As my body shook in the power of my orgasm, he continued to lick and tongue my clit as he finger fucked me.</p> <p>"Oh god, yes," I screamed as I grabbed the head board to keep myself from screaming at the end of my orgasm.</p> <p>The orgasm was so strong that I couldn't breathe at all. Michael sat up to take off my shoes and then continued to lick and finger fuck me as gently as he could.</p> <p>"Good god, that was so wonderful," I turned over to face him as he finished with my feet.</p> <p>He looked at me with an odd look.</p> <p>"I think there is a bit more I can do for you," he added, as he began to kiss my lips.</p> <p>I wrapped my legs around his waist and pulled him towards me.</p> <p>He slipped his cock to my entrance and began to move his hard cock inside of me slowly.</p> <p>We kissed deeply and I could taste myself on his lips.</p> <p>"This time," I moaned as he began to kiss and nibble my neck.</p> <p>"I am not going to last much longer," he said.</p> <p>In his other handâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
