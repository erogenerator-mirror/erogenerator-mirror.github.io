Opening it, I stepped inside. In the light of the room, my eyes adjusted to the hallway. He didn't say a word as I walked past him into the room. Instead, he closed the door and turned to the wall.</p> <p>I could hear him mutter something in my ear. "What should I do, girl?" I heard myself say. "Get a grip. I'll tell you when we get there."</p> <p>In one fluid motion, I began to turn so I could walk in front of him, but he stopped me. "That's fine. Let's go."</p> <p>He pulled me out of the bedroom and into the hallway. I kept staring at him as we walked, feeling his eyes roam over my body. It was all I had ever wanted. All I had ever needed. Everything that I wanted and craved from him. Nothing could be better than him. As he turned down the hall he let his eyes look down at me. I could feel my knees beginning to buckle under my growing desire. What was it that was going on at that moment? It didn't matter. I was going to have him in a second.</p> <p>"No," I whispered. "I don't want anything. Please." I was losing control of my body. I thought I was going to pass out from his gaze. But, his gaze kept coming back. I couldn't help it. His gaze soothed me as I took a step out of the doorway before realizing what had happened. I looked around quickly, trying to figure out what was going on. There were some other bodies out there, but I couldn't really be sure.</p> <p>After a few long seconds he took my hand in his. He led me down the hallway and into his room. Once inside, he closed the door, turned on the lights, and told me to get comfortable.</p> <p>As I climbed up the steps, I felt my body relax. As I began to climb the bed, I thought that somehow I had slipped back into my role. That was probably exactly what was going on. It was hard to believe that I would have willingly done what I just had to do and continue to do it. I had never really allowed myself to be so...submissive. But now I was in a whole new kind of power and power that I had never experienced before.</p> <p>I felt his breath on my shoulder. "You'll do it. You will. I'm sure you'll love it. Trust me. And be ready," he said. His voice carried so perfectly that I didn't wonder why I had felt the need to get out. When he said trust, I knew that we were on a whole different level.</p> <p>I reached out my hand. "Shall I trust you, daddy?"</p> <p>"Yes. You've come to trust me, girl. Now just do it."</p> <p>"Thank you," I purred as I laid back on the bed. "I will." It felt better to be near him. I was becoming so comfortable with this man. All my fears were gone. All I had to do was let him take me. When he finished undressing me, he turned me over onto my hands and knees. "Roll over," he said softly.</p> <p>I was confused. This wasn't the first time he had touched me. I suppose that it was his first time as well. I would have loved to be on my back, face to face with him. If he would do anything, anything at all, to take me, I would have willingly submitted myself. But I didn't believe in any of that. I was in love with the man I just met.</p> <p>I heard his feet leave the hardwood floor. "Are you ready? Do what I say." I turned over and heard a smile form on the lips of the man I just met. He had chosen well. I wanted everything he had to offer. And before I could even get more confused and embarrassed, he was already on top of me.</p> <p>I felt his hard cock sliding between my legs. I felt the heat flowing into me. My own body responded to this unexpected invasion from him. This wasn't me that was being defiled. These were men. The real me.</p> <p>"Don't you like it?" he asked while continuing his thrust. His hands held me close. Before I could think or think of something else, he was thrusting into me.</p> <p>"Yeah," I purred. "I like it."</p> <p>"Mmmm," he moaned. His hands were exploring me. He began to gently lift me and drop me down along his cock. This position, combined with my position, allowed him to lift me farther against him. I felt his arms wrap around me. I felt my own arms slide around him, holding him tight. The feelings of him filling meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
