That feels nice," she cooed in what could have used a better word.</p> <p>He took a deep breath and began to slowly move. "Do you like this?" he said.</p> <p>"Oh! Yes," she said, her eyes closing while she moved.</p> <p>"Are you close?"</p> <p>"I'm close. Do you want me to stop?"</p> <p>"No. Go ahead," he said, stopping.</p> <p>"It feels good. Do you want me to do it better?" she repeated.</p> <p>"You have me do it very well," he said.</p> <p>"You do?" she asked.</p> <p>"Uh huh. It feels nice. I could do it better with you."</p> <p>"No, you're too big. I won't fit," she said, sitting up and starting to move again.</p> <p>He grabbed her and pulled herself back until her legs fell off the bed. He didn't try to do it again.</p> <p>"No. Do it slowly. Do it with your hips. It will stretch a bit, but you'll have to go slow."</p> <p>She laughed and moved back to lay down, pushing her hips back to the edge of the bed and lifting her legs and holding them up high.</p> <p>He looked at her, smiling when he saw how her pussy was spread like that. It had a wet, pink slit about halfway between her right knee and thigh. He reached out and felt the muscle there, pulling back just enough to feel it. She closed her eyes and spread her legs a little more, and he could feel the hair around her pussy sliding up and down in the little groove.</p> <p>She raised the head of her breast in his hands, rolling a nipple between them, and he pulled up on it. He could feel himself getting a bit more aroused, and the skin around it felt tight and smooth. He didn't mind.</p> <p>He touched his finger to her pussy, sliding it up and down before settling on her clit. He looked down and saw that his cock was erect again. He moved his right hand, his middle finger moving up and down over the swollen dickhead while his thumb rubbed the tiny hole underneath.</p> <p>"What the fuck are you doing? Why did you stop?"</p> <p>"Hush. This is so good. Oh, yes. I can feel you, just don't move," she said, running one hand through his blonde hair while she moved her hips.</p> <p>He moved his middle finger up inside her pussy, finding the muscle he wanted to feel. She felt it for a moment and raised her ass slightly off the bed to help in. He moved in and out, feeling her move with him and making his penis get harder. Slowly, he got a good grip on her clit, rubbing over the tip and down the side when he slipped his middle finger into her hole.</p> <p>"Ah! That's nice," she said, closing her eyes again.</p> <p>He did it again and again, making her hips raise up against his hand as he rubbed her g-spot with the thumb of his left hand. He felt her moving her hips, her entire pussy opening and closing as he moved his finger in and out of it. Her face was screwed up with excitement, holding out as long as she could while she moved her hips up and down in his rhythm. When he slipped one finger inside from the front, she pushed her hip back at the same time, sliding the hand off his dick to rest on her stomach, her body tensing and relaxing with each new push.</p> <p>When he slipped his hand off her nipple, she jumped away from him and ran to the bathroom. Her hips were still moving, keeping her pussy open for him. He watched her as she left the bathroom and went down the hall.</p> <p>He closed his eyes but kept his finger inside her as she went, until he heard her knock and jump through the door.</p> <p>He heard her, his stomach growling slightly as she sat on the toilet.</p> <p>"Sorry, I can't use this," she offered.</p> <p>"Sure," he said, still lying on his stomach.</p> <p>"You okay?" she asked, getting out the water and helping out.</p> <p>"I'm not really sure. Just a bit nervous."</p> <p>"Me too," she said. "You have the best hands. This feels so good."</p> <p>"Oh. You feel so good," he said. She pushed herself back against him so she could reach around him as well. Her pussy felt so hot around his finger and her pussy juices glistened in the toilet light. He put his hand underneath his chest to feel.</p> <p>"Just a couple of drops of water, and let me go and I'll wash them," she said.</p> <p>"I'm okay." But she didn't sit back on the toilet.
