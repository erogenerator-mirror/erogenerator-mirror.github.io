In the darkened, darkroom, she sat on the end of the bed and let out a groan; her nipples had become rock hard and tingling. Her hand reached out to touch them, sending a shiver up her spine; she began pumping it up, feeling it become erect for her.</p> <p>She imagined what it was like to masturbate under someone else’s fingers; it felt so good; especially to do that to herself, but she knew she had to get this right. She reached under her nightdress and felt her pussy. It felt so good. She was so wet that it made her slide two fingers inside herself once again, as she moved her thumb over her clit that was tingling again.</p> <p>She lay there thinking back, imagining her body sliding back and forth on Peter’s fingers, her body shuddered, as one of Peter's fingers slipped in, deeper than she could have imagined. Her breasts felt so good on that hand, she wanted to cum so badly. She closed her eyes and imagined her pussy gripping Peter’s hand. It felt so good. She could feel her mouth opening as if to say “Fuck me” but instead her words got lost in the waves of sexual passion from her fantasy.</p> <p>Her pussy clamped around her finger, so tight it felt good she felt it pulsating around the movement. Her thumb kept massaging her clit, feeling all the way up inside her as she came again, hard; with a force she rarely felt before. As the wave of pleasure subsided, it became apparent, Peter was about to cum. The thought spurred her to her orgasm, thrusting two fingers in and out of her warm pussy, harder in her orgasm as she thought about her lover doing that to her.</p> <p>She let out a small sigh of appreciation as she sat down to pull her nightdress off, and she could not help but notice Peter’s bulge. They just stood there enjoying each other’s bodies as the light from the hallway illuminated, and there was some kissing to go on.</p> <p>“Are you ready?” she asked. Peter had never asked permission before this, but he was so fucking horny tonight. She smiled back to him, and he grabbed her tits and squeezed them.</p> <p>“Oh yeah...” she purred. She moved closer, and let Peter’s fingers slide out of her pussy and into her mouth. His fingers slid across her breasts, caressing her hardened bud, making her body go through waves of sexual energy again. “Mmm...mmm...mmm...mmm...mm...” she moaned as he finger-fucked her wetness, moving the finger in circles over her clitoris until she was writhing on the bed, lost in another, equally delightful orgasm. Peter pulled himself out of her mouth and slipped his fingers in his mouth, tasting her taste.</p> <p>“Mmm, you taste good,” he said, looking up at her. He pulled his fingers out and watched as the juices oozing out from between her legs, slid down the side of her face, down her neck, and over her shoulder to her breasts, where she was pulling and sucking on her nipples.</p> <p>She wanted to suck on Peter’s cock, but felt there was no need. He stood over her, staring down at her, his cock now pulsing, pointing up to meet her eyes. She wanted to taste him. She wanted to taste all of him. It wouldn’t matter if there wasn’t enough light filtering through the dark room, Peter was just too much of a voyeur to make any noise outside, so she didn’t. She didn’t need to wait long.</p> <p>“Suck me, baby…” he said to her, placing his cock at the lips of her pussy and pressing forward. She moaned out, feeling the tip of his cock touch her lips and through her wetness, she felt a pressure at her pussy, pushing it in. Her lover pushed the tip further into her body, as Peter’s body was a little below hers, in the shadows of the bedroom.</p> <p>She pushed herself back on him, feeling his cock inside her tight pussy. Her pussy clenched around his cock, trying to suck the tip in, as he kept his cock deep inside her, all the way in, all the way in. “Oh yeah,” was the only sound she had. Her lovers cock made her want to be taken, to feel his cock deep inside her. She moaned out again. Suddenly she felt his body weight on her, his cock at the entrance to her body.</p> <p>“Are you ready—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
