I mean that you had sex with your uncle, your son, your father, your daughter."</p> <p>"No," I said with sincerity, "It was exciting just to think about it, actually."</p> <p>"Good," he replied, "because I found I'm still thinking about it."</p> <p>There was something about the sincerity of his words which was alluring and yet at some level, I still didn't know how to react. What if he was just being honest with me, and I had to believe that it was true? How would it look? What if he was actually right? What if it would make my husband think of me sexually? A woman, after all, is a woman who wants to fuck, and there is nothing wrong at all with the idea of being aroused by an attractive man fucking a pretty, shapely woman.</p> <p>"So?" I asked, "Do I think I'll be doing that to you, too?"</p> <p>"I hope not," he answered softly, "but the thought is a nice one."</p> <p>We kissed again, long and passionately, before he said, "I need to get back to my suite before my wife gets here. Please let me know if you can watch again."</p> <p>"Sure," I replied, "I'll leave you guys alone."</p> <p>He walked out of the room, with the sound of an arm being pulled behind him. I looked at him, surprised by what I saw at once. A young man was standing in front of me, waiting for my response. My face was suddenly overcome with shock when I got the realization of why he had been waiting.</p> <p>"Oh," I said in amazement, "What on earth is wrong with you, David?"</p> <p>"Well," he sighed as if I didn't matter, "I was just wondering if it would be possible to be a good mother to your mother."</p> <p>"Really? What does she think?" I asked, now realizing that I did indeed feel the same feelings for my father.</p> <p>"She's been looking forward to this for a long time," he said, "Especially when she sees you naked. Do you really still have a hard cock?"</p> <p>"So long my son," I said with sadness and joy.</p> <p>"I couldn't stand to look at David so much," he replied, "I'm sorry. I don't regret seeing you naked for a long time, so I guess I must have been a good mother."</p> <p>He gave me another look of pity and then walked to me and gently kissed my lips, his strong and masculine lips caressing me. I didn't move.</p> <p>"Please," I said, "That's nice."</p> <p>"Please what?" he asked.</p> <p>"Please kiss me, honey," I replied, "I want you to make love to me."</p> <p>His mouth captured mine while he reached under my clothes in his hand, one, barely touching my skin. His touch was both firm and gentle, yet his lips were aflame with unbridled passion as he made love to me with his tongue and fingers. I felt as if I was being sucked between a maw in an animal frenzy. After a couple of minutes, I felt his fingers slip easily between the lips of my vagina and he inserted them in and out to my own slow and steady rhythm. Once he established a rhythm, he was pushing his fingers into my hole and pulling them out quickly before plunging them again. It felt fantastic.</p> <p>"Please," I begged while he did it to me, "I really want you, David. Let me make love to you just once."</p> <p>"Oh, Mary," he sighed, "That's lovely. You're wonderful. I really meant it."</p> <p>He kissed me passionately, then kissed my lips, my cheeks, and my eyelids, the parts of my body which he could barely get his tongue inside to touch. I felt a thrill travel up and down my spine at his words.</p> <p>"Oh, honey," I said as he kissed me once more, "I really need to make love to you. Take me to bed."</p> <p>"Oh, yes!" he replied eagerly, "I think you are beautiful."</p> <p>"Come here," I said when he moved to stand between my legs, "I've wanted to do this a lot."</p> <p>"Now what?" he asked.</p> <p>"Now we both should lie down," I said, "Let me take off your clothes and then you can lie back on the bed and we can be gentle until I finish off you."</p> <p>"No," he said with a little trepidation.</p> <p>"Yes," I insisted, "It's OK."</p> <p>"Oh, no. You need to feel better now," I said to himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
