She pulled the straps away from her shoulder and looked up at James. He had removed his shirt, and they both gazed at his smooth chest, his slender waist and the line of his waist to his hips.</p> <p>"Would it happen if you had sex with me?" she asked. "Are you sure you want to?"</p> <p>"I think so, but I don't care anymore." His smile had grown deeper, though it seemed almost shy. "It doesn't matter if you don't trust me. It doesn't matter that I'm your boss. And I am not yours yet. I'm yours for as long as you want me." After pausing a moment he added: "I'd rather have a woman as you, rather than the other than the one that I want you. I'm tired of being the one in your bedroom. And I'm tired of being alone."</p> <p>Rebecca knew his mind better than her. It had taken her this long to realize just how close she had come to becoming a woman. She had become used to the idea of her own place, and in her own world. She had spent the past year trying to establish that she had no other place than a small studio apartment in a small city in which she could live comfortably without being noticed, but she just simply couldn't get in. But now everything had changed. The thought that she had to choose him, of taking his breath away, of him being her boss, of her being so free of responsibility, that she would become like he when he had a family to take care of her in the world outside her home, gave her a sense of panic. She hadn't even known what to expect from him for five years.</p> <p>She had looked forward to what he would do to her when they'd both left the office that night. Of how she would feel, what she would demand to do, and what she would do differently to him.</p> <p>"Do you really want to get back in touch with your boyfriend?" she managed, hoping she could get away with a little more than that to keep a low profile. It wasn't easy just then.</p> <p>"Yes." He had paused for some time during this hesitation. Finally he smiled and answered: "Maybe, but, for real, if I could ever get this with you I wouldn't."</p> <p>Rebecca was relieved that he would want her for his first time. She was surprised too. Most guys didn't want a chance to really get to know her. She wasn't sure if this would work with her, if this was as far as she was going to allow it to go. But she liked this. It was an attractive thought. She had always wanted to have a relationship, to have a relationship with someone that made her feel desired. She had been doing just that for a long time.</p> <p>"Would it be something you do every morning, after going to bed?" Rebecca wondered, taking his hand to lead him toward the large open bed. He seemed to have grown accustomed to the idea of being seen by her the way he had been at the office the first time she let him get her so caught up with her that he'd seen her nude.</p> <p>"Well, yes," he replied softly. "I could do that for you all day if you want."</p> <p>Rebecca had almost laughed at that, but had been surprised at his confidence. She had never thought of him as a lover, and the idea of letting him go without asking at that time and then ending it suddenly sounded a bit silly. But she had wanted to be free of such feelings.</p> <p>"Will you be in the office?" Rebecca asked. "There aren't very many there, and they should have you working. Will you be able to handle that?"</p> <p>James hesitated. "I could, but..."</p> <p>"Yes!" Rebecca interrupted him. "Come to the office."</p> <p>James nodded and smiled broadly, then walked toward the office door and turned it. Rebecca could feel the tension and fear and the excitement rising in her like an ocean swell. There was no going back now. She was his. He was hers, and he was strong enough to overcome her fear of a little more than a relationship.</p> <p>Rebecca smiled. She didn't want this, couldn't have this. But she could deal with more than one man to her. A relationship that included a good man, a good man that could be happy, a man that could satisfy her sexually, and one that could have her in her bed regularly, if she allowed him to.</p> <p>The bedroom door closed, and Rebecca pulled the curtain aside just enough to slip into the bed. She watched him closely as he entered the room. She saw that he was a little unsteady from sitting for so long. She moved quickly to close the door, then quickly pushed himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
