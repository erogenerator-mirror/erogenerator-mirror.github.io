"You've got a bit of a body."</p> <p>"I'm a man, and I have a good body," I said, trying to play it cool. "But in a lot of ways it looks like you really have a body."</p> <p>"You think I'll be the first to admit it," Kani accused. "I'm getting to know it a bit more, too." She put a hand on my shoulder. "I mean, if I can help it, I might be able to help you with some of your fantasies. Do you think we can satisfy a man that way?"</p> <p>"I think you're right," I said. "But I think I'd rather that it take place here...now."</p> <p>Kani's hand slid around my waist and I felt her take me in her fingers, my cock still trapped in her vagina. With a laugh, I gave her ass a playful smack, leaving a red mark.</p> <p>"We'll find a way," Kani said. "You can't deny how much you enjoy fucking a woman, or at least that you enjoy being aroused by your own sexuality. I like it!"</p> <p>"I really do like your sexuality," I assured her. And it was true...I enjoyed the sexy way Kani talked to me. The way she was the type of person who was a little bit too easy - and not the kind of person that could be seduced. There were times when I got the feeling that I really didn't want to be in the real world, but I really liked being with Kani...and I liked to see her with other men. This experience was different, though, since a part of me felt more in control when Kani was in control, and at other times it was a bit harder to relax.</p> <p>We arrived at the location we had chosen...and took a seat in the hot tub, where there wasn't really much. We took a few drinks, and talked about whatever came my way. After she had a couple of cocktails, she asked me if we were still interested in an anal adventure.</p> <p>"Of course we are," I assured her. "But do you still want to have anal sex, or are you afraid I'll ruin your butt?"</p> <p>Kani's eyebrows furrowed. "Let's just say that if you are into it, that's another option." I'd never considered a threesome. I certainly wasn't looking for the kind of relationship that two people enjoy. What I was suggesting was what, on top of anything else, was a very sexy relationship that could easily become a very sexy relationship. Especially if we were going to have a threesome that Kani would be happy to do on the first date. In the meantime, I could make plans to get her hooked up with someone once in a while.</p> <p>It took an hour or so, but we finally finished the steaks we had been saving as they were cutting up our salad. We didn't actually bother taking the steaks into the kitchen to wash them in the big glass tumbler, because we knew that the hot tub we were staying in was completely full.</p> <p>Kani's eyes had never left the sight of our naked bodies as we took a few bites of the food. I made sure that I kept her food down to her navel, and also that I was careful to keep our drinks level as I walked over to the bed with a tray. As I set the tray down on the nightstand, Kani's eyes got wide.</p> <p>"You really think I'm ready for anal sex, don't you, you dirty little slut?" I asked her while I got on the bed. "Are you really afraid I might ruin your ass?" I asked Kani as I settled in.</p> <p>"No, you're absolutely right. And the other option would be to have sex with both of you at the same time...if you really want the same kind of fun we were hoping for...to fuck two people at the same time."</p> <p>"All right, all right. I don't know if I can," Kani said. "But if we both want it and have some kind of experience, I don't know if I can."</p> <p>"Well then I'm going to give both of you a good time, and maybe we can just go out and try it," I suggested.</p> <p>"I'd really like to do it," Kani said with a soft smile on her face. "But I'm so nervous, that this would probably be way better that it is with you."</p> <p>"It'll be all right," I assured her. "I'm sure you know that, Kani."</p> <p>I went back down to take my clothes off, and Kani got off the bed.
