When I was around boys my age, I had been the hottest guy in the school and no girl ever said that to me. That was just me being a normal male and not even knowing what guys in my class thought and did to me. But I never had to tell this to anyone. It was never a big deal. I had always enjoyed teasing girls and I didn't know that I wanted to do it more.</p> <p>I had never had much of a sex life, since I was a virgin. But I did remember the girls in my class who took an interest in me. So I figured that I would enjoy this, and the only way I was going to do it for a change is if we were both like that.</p> <p>One time I had been in the office. I had been assigned to take a test. I could tell the guys in the lab were starting to notice me. I didn't even want to get into that kind of trouble, so I just looked at them wondering if they noticed me. I looked at the floor and noticed that my eyes began to well up and I didn't even care if this was a guy watching them. They had no idea that I was there and if they just looked up at the ceiling, I knew I was going to get up and sit down next to him.</p> <p>But they didn't make a sound. They just kept on looking ahead at nothing. They had obviously never seen me doing this before, so I had to ask them. "Will I need to ask you to go away?"</p> <p>They just looked up at me, as I didn't even acknowledge their response. I decided to take something else in. "Well, I don't know. I'm not sure I can really go with you, if this is as important as I think it is."</p> <p>"Sure," he was still looking at me, even though he seemed to have lost himself. "I can go."</p> <p>I walked to my desk, picked up the test, and sat down. I was so nervous about this. I had always been good at holding down a conversation like that, and even in high school when my body was so tense.</p> <p>"Hey, I can't tell you how much this means to me."</p> <p>He looked at me, for a moment, and then looked me sideways. "I mean, when we met in college. You didn't do anything wrong, and there was nothing wrong. The first time you came on to me was because I was really interested in you. I'm not like all the girls I dated. I just got caught up in the fact that the guys around here were like 'this was one of those stuff.'</p> <p>I looked up at him, a little bit surprised, "Uh, I'm not sure I could do this."</p> <p>"But you'll do it," he told me with a smirk.</p> <p>"But I can't do this," I said. "I don't know if I can do this. I'm not sure it even would be right. It's just too weird. It's so wrong."</p> <p>"I'm not sure about this, but we have to know that you're interested. If you want to stop, we can stop."</p> <p>"But I want to do this," I said, "even if it's kind of embarrassing. My dad is probably going to feel weird not trying to talk to me again."</p> <p>He chuckled a little, "Well, it's the middle of summer and the whole dorm is kind of deserted. I wouldn't mind seeing you though, for one thing. And if you want to go through with it, you can come along. We'd be more comfortable around here."</p> <p>I felt my stomach drop. Just this type of interaction, what could be more embarrassing, me or not. I couldn't even say no. Maybe this is what he wanted me to do. "Fine."</p> <p>He got up and went to get a pen and a paper. He made notes and got me a pen, then gave me another pen, and I wrote on my own and wrote a few more.</p> <p>"I don't know about this, but I don't think it's going to be as bad as I'm planning for. We wouldn't want to ruin your chances."</p> <p>"I don't like the thought of anyone else here, and I won't say a thing."</p> <p>He took my pen and wrote it on his desk. "That's fine."</p> <p>He walked over to me and put his arm around my shoulders. "See, you can't even think you can do this. We've worked it out and now we're going to have to figure out how we're going to do it. I'm not just going to do it for you."</p> <p>I looked down briefly, then back up at him. â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
