You'll have to come with me."</p> <p>"I'm afraid I'm not allowed to," I replied.</p> <p>"Oh. Well, let's fix ourselves a bit," she said with a wink.</p> <p>"I'll hold you to your promise," I told her.</p> <p>When we got back to town, I went straight to my bedroom and put on some shorts and a shirt. I had my wallet with me. "What's it?" she asked. "You don't have any identification?"</p> <p>"Nothing," I answered. "Just that I'm from Los Angeles and the only name I have is 'Cobelle'."</p> <p>"I really don't want to see the pictures," she said.</p> <p>"I can't," I said. I was about to walk out when the phone rang. It was our mother saying she was in a bit of a panic. "I'm in L.A. and I'm going outside to check the coast," I said.</p> <p>I went outside. When she saw me, she asked what I did. My name was on the porch and the coast was clear. I saw two guys coming out on the porch to see what I was doing. In the distance, I could make out the beach, where mom and her friends were. It turned out two were in the hotel bar, and they were watching the porn videos and drinking. On the other end, three other guys were sitting at a table where mom and her friend were sitting.</p> <p>"Did you come?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>"What happened?"</p> <p>"Just like that." She smiled at me. She was very happy to see me, and her happiness reached the point that she started to cry. Her tears were soaking through my clothes. "Oh, my God," I said. "They all... they... they did what they did to me." "I'm not sorry," she said with tears running down her cheek. "Please forgive me," she said. "Please forgive them." "I'm not sorry," I said. "Please forgive them."</p> <p>"I won't," I said. I handed her the picture. "That was mom's. She looked at it and said, "That's the one," and the other guys gave me the same treatment, and one of the guys came closer to the two. They looked at mom and saw the picture, and one of the guys whispered to mom, but all she said was, "Don't worry."</p> <p>"It hurt like hell," I said. She nodded before she handed the picture back to me. I looked at it one more time. Mom said something else from the other end, and the guys stopped what they were doing to see us.</p> <p>"That really hurt," I said. "Please don't tell anyone. I'll do whatever you say." We walked down the path to the pier and got in our cars. We had just turned back toward town when we saw the first guy coming up the road. He had his eyes wide open, and I knew he could actually see his mom and I standing there. He stopped walking, and looked up, where we were. The look on his face was as though he had been waiting for the light, and he didn't care where he'd just been standing, he just looked at the picture again.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," he said. "I just... I didn't mean to...." he said quietly. He was holding onto my shoulders again, and I could feel how hard he was pressing down on my shoulder. "I... I had to come."</p> <p>"Come to the beach?" I said. I started to say something else, but just then, I felt the tears start to drip on me again. I pulled up my shorts, and ran towards the beach. I took a step back, and heard my mom screaming. Dad just sat staring at us, wondering what was going on. Mom had started to rub her eyes and cry. Dad took his eyes off him quickly and asked if anyone had hurt her. I waved at him. I had just had enough and it didn't feel right. I was going to do it.</p> <p>We found a beach house that had a large walkway leading to it. The beach was still a bit dark, but it had lots of people walking around. I took my shirt off, and we climbed up the steps to join the others. We walked around the place and I couldn't help but look at my mother. She was crying herself. I wanted her to stop, but I also didn't want to lose her friend, not with dad and mine already here.</p> <p>After a few minutes of walking around the house, I turned to her and said, "You okay, Mom?"</p> <p>She looked at me, then nodded, "No," she started. "I need a drink, you tooâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
