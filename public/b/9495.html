"What will I do if you hurt me?"</p> <p>"Do you remember what we agreed, and how you agreed to do this?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Yes. I remember," she sobbed, feeling helpless.</p> <p>"That is so wrong honey," she sniffled. "It's so evil. I think you're going to be raped by somebody."</p> <p>"It's only evil once a month, isn't it?"</p> <p>"It's the only way to do that," I assured her. "And we have already discussed that."</p> <p>"Oh God, please don't hurt me," she said again, but louder.</p> <p>I reached out and took the tiny black leather strap and looped it on, drawing it gently across her naked breast, then wrapping and wrapping the leather around it, leaving it suspended between her breast.</p> <p>"There," I said. "I found that will hurt better with you."</p> <p>"I thought it would...that it would be best if I was on my knees," she whimpered.</p> <p>"Let me know when you're about to begin," I said with a chuckle.</p> <p>I sat on the bed with her and undid my trousers, freeing my cock with only the tip of my cock resting along her face.</p> <p>"Please," the girl whispered, struggling to her knees. Her bare breasts hung heavily over the bed, her nipples hard peaks, sticking nearly three inches out as she stared at them with a desperate look of desperation. "Please. . ." she whispered. "Let me suck it,"</p> <p>Slowly, I sank down in between the girl's wide legged legs. The strap hanging below her head had no point of support. I didn't care much for the effect my cock would have on her mind; it's only what she deserved that it would never happen to her. I didn't even care how much of the leather was against her hot little body. It just felt as though she were wearing the strap to remind her that she was mine. A little shiver of excitement ran through my body, causing my cock to stiffen further and my breathing quicken.</p> <p>"Is that good, baby?" I asked her. "Does it feel good to suck one of my sweet little cocks?"</p> <p>"Yes," she whimpered.</p> <p>"Yes, what?" I asked. I wanted the girl to make the most of it.</p> <p>"Yes," she said louder.</p> <p>That was more than enough to keep me going, and the thought of being fucked by this woman in front of her boyfriend, my lover, and her boyfriend's brother, got me going even harder. I thought of myself giving her what she asked for.</p> <p>I started to use my cock again to force her mouth open, as I slowly worked my way down between her legs. I slid the leather strap lower along her crack, so that the tip of my hard cock just grazed her outer lips.</p> <p>"Ohhhh..." the girl cooed, but didn't say a thing, as it seemed she already knew what was coming. She reached down and touched my cock, feeling its hard member with her fingertips.</p> <p>"Don't..." she groaned. "We have nothing to do today, silly."</p> <p>I slid my hand along the shaft of my own hard cock and looked down at her. She closed her eyes as my fingers ran over her pussy lips, spreading them apart just a little bit.</p> <p>"I'm going to fuck you," I said.</p> <p>"Please," the girl said. "I just can't stand it." I was about to slide her panties to the side, when she pushed me away, reaching beneath herself with her fingers, pulling them down her body with them. She stepped out of them, standing in front of me naked, and then pushed me toward the bed. I sat down as she took the leather strap off of her thigh, allowing her to pull it up and off of her pussy. I moved to take the strap from her, but she grabbed it by the handle, yanking me back toward the bed and onto it so that I fell down on the bed.</p> <p>"Come over here," she commanded. As I moved, she pulled me along the bed, then knelt on the bed next to me, reaching into my lap and taking my hard cock in her hands, pumping it slowly, as though she were trying to get it to come alive. She bent over to get a closer look, looking at my hard cock, her breath quick, as she stroked my cock, the soft lace of the strap rubbing my cock just right.</p> <p>"God, I wanted to feel that cock inside me all day," sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
