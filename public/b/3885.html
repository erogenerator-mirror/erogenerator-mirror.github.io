There's no need to be rude about it."</p> <p>"Oh, it's kinda cute. Well, if you were really good, I wouldn't have to give you a damn peck on your way back to the dorm. Or maybe I should." I said.</p> <p>"Yeah. It's cool. Well, now that you mention it, I hope its not too much." She replied.</p> <p>"Actually, its not anything serious. I'm just glad I saw you the first time. I can probably come back any time. But no pressure. That's the only reason I'm here, if you want? Or better yet, a night out with a few friends, maybe." I gave her a peck, then I went back to studying.</p> <p>A short time later; I sat down next to my roommate Mike, and had a light dinner while waiting for the game to start. We sat and chatted for a while, and then got ready for bed. Mike was definitely drunk. I told him that I didn't think it was a good idea to go out tonight, but I had to at least have a good night's sleep. Mike had a bit of a hangover, so I was glad he didn't get drunk early.</p> <p>I got into bed and curled into a ball, but as I began to drift off to sleep, I turned my body on top of Mike's so that we were spooning. Before I knew it, I was falling asleep with him inside me.</p> <p>The next morning, we were both up, but still having some light left over this morning. I had been asleep, but Mike could probably use a wake up call. I was also awake when I felt him getting up in bed, and I couldn't keep sleep. I was definitely awake when I heard him walking into the living room.</p> <p>"Oh, hey. Are you up?" He asked.</p> <p>"Yeah." I replied.</p> <p>"Good morning." He walked over and sat down right where I was sleeping. "So, what's a woman like you doing at the end of your day?" He asked.</p> <p>"I'm not doing anything." I replied.</p> <p>"No, you're not going anywhere." He told me.</p> <p>"What do mean?" I asked curiously.</p> <p>"I'm just going to lie here, for a bit. Maybe watch a movie?"</p> <p>"Sure." I said, I felt like I was going to fall right into his lap. I don't know why, but I just did. I felt Mike's hands begin to cup my breasts. I closed my eyes and let him gently push them into his hands. He then rolled me over and began to kiss his way down to my pussy. He moved his tongue across my lips which became hard in response to what he was doing to me.</p> <p>As his tongue made its way further down to my wet sex, I felt him pull my pants down. His tongue pushed inside me, and I gasped as he made the transition to my clit. I reached down and began to rub my clit, which felt amazing. I felt a finger slowly slip inside me, and then another. I felt his tongue lick my lips. I spread my legs wide, so his tongue could find my clit again.</p> <p>"God." I moaned. "I'm so close." I panted.</p> <p>Mike stopped what he was doing, and slowly moved up my body. He then leaned over and began kissing me. I felt his tongue slowly entering my mouth, and then as I was kissing him back, it slid up my nose and then to my lips. I felt it brush against my teeth, and then as I felt a little bit of saliva that escaped, it was in a way similar to what I experienced after an experience with my girlfriend with my hand. Mike quickly moved his lips down to my nipple and began to suck on it. I felt the sensations from his mouth as he moved lower and lower on me. It felt so much different with his lips instead of his fingers.</p> <p>I reached down and began to stroke his cock in order to feel what he would feel. I wanted him in my pussy, I wanted to feel him thrust inside of me, and I wanted to feel him fill me completely. Mike pulled his mouth off of me for a moment but quickly pushed me back just a bit. He quickly moved into a position over me and began to kiss me. He moved his cock into my pussy, and I felt like if I weren't so wet, he would have slipped inside of me.</p> <p>I felt him position his cock at the entrance to my canal and as he pushed, I felt his head sink in, his cock filling me up. I opened my eyes to look into his as he began to pump his hips up and down.</p> <p>"Whatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
