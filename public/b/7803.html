His eyes were very intense, almost a glazing look and I felt my entire body tingle with arousal as I knew my nipples were hard as rocks.</p> <p>I heard him say, "I saw your tits, they're so beautiful. Can I touch them? They're so hard. Please, I need your hands on them."</p> <p>He slid two fingers between my full breasts, which were so full and firm and felt every inch of my skin. "They feel so sweet when you feel them like this. God you're so smooth. What a turn-on. I'm just going to fuck you," he whispered. "Let's go home and fuck, maybe I will do that a couple more times."</p> <p>"What about the condoms, I can't take them," I moaned as my orgasm started to build. I looked down into his eyes, my body was quivering. I was close. How could a man want just a little something so bad? So he'd want it, I thought to myself before asking him if he was sure.</p> <p>"Sure," he said and they fell out of my hands with his hands. We went to the bedroom, laid on the bed and started to kiss again. He kissed down my neck and to the nape of my neck to my breasts and back up again as I began to pant with anticipation. His tongue licked and nibbled my nipple. I moaned. He sucked it hard as he rubbed his nipple over my other breast. As he sucked so did his own hands and his fingertips worked all over my breasts, his hands massaging them and pinching the nipples.</p> <p>I squirmed as he knelt between my legs, my breathing deep and hard and rapid. He didn't waste any time as he spread my legs with his thighs. Leaning over him. Spreading. Taking me. He lifted me up, placed my ass on the edge of his bed, and knelt between my legs. I arched my back up to him, as he slowly lowered us both down. He looked down at my dripping cunt, swollen, aching, aching as I sat there, legs spread, arms at my sides.</p> <p>After he put my legs over his shoulders, he placed his penis at the entrance to my vagina and very gently pushed. "Oh God, oh, oh," I moaned as I felt the head of his penis fill me. He slowly pulled me back up to meet him with one firm push. I arched my back as much as I could while they moved me back and forth. I felt like I was being stretched so far apart as his long shaft moved in and out of me.</p> <p>"That's it, fuck me," I whispered. "Fuck me hard. Do me."</p> <p>He pulled me up and down on him at the same time. He was fucking me now as we both moaned, grunted, groaned and screamed together. It was so hard. It was so big. I could feel his pubic hair rub against the cheeks of my ass as I was in this position. I was arching and gyrating on his lap and he was giving me the whole length of him as each of us groaned louder and louder.</p> <p>This continued until I started to come down from my climax and he pulled my ass down onto his crotch and continued to thrust into me until there was nothing else between us. When my breathing finally returned to normal, I saw him staring at me. My eyes were wild. He put his arms around my shoulders. I didn't think he was finished, but he wasn't. My legs were around him still. I couldn't move anymore. He continued to thrust into me until he exploded into the condom and rolled off me. He collapsed beside me.</p> <p>We lay there, his arm around me. Neither having to move for fear of falling, he finally spoke. "That really was incredible, you weren't supposed to do that. You just took me so far up my cunt without any resistance."</p> <p>"No, I didn't take everything, I'm going to fuck you again." Before I could say any more, we slept.</p> <p>When I woke up, I was out on the balcony topless, I had the balcony door open, I was naked and the heat was radiating from inside. I was very horny and went to sleep without a stitch on.</p> <p>My second day went by and I left work early to go see some friends. When I got back home I looked at the clock. It was 8:00am. I needed to change into some more feminine clothes for a change of clothes. I checked my dresser. It was all the way up to the third floor. I checkedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
