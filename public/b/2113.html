"Do you want me to finish?" he asked.</p> <p>"No, just relax. I have done this once before." he said, sliding one of her bra cups over her nipples and releasing them for a moment. "I think my body is sensitive," he added, sliding his hand behind her again and sliding her panties down.</p> <p>"I like that. Now I'm going to roll over and take that little thing that's sticking out." she said, trying to roll off onto her back.</p> <p>"I'm sorry baby, I just couldn't help myself," he said, sliding his hands back to her thighs while reaching back to slide her panties down a bit. "Don't worry. Just lay back and relax." she said, trying to roll over on her back again.</p> <p>"But my hands are all sweaty," she said, looking around for her top or anything to cover herself.</p> <p>"That's okay. We'll go on my side and that way you could just let yourself go." he said, starting to slide his hands back up to her shoulders and over her arms.</p> <p>"But what about my bra? I told you I'm not wearing one." he said. "Let's go on my side."</p> <p>He leaned over and opened her robe and slid it off of her, leaving her naked from the waist up. "I don't want you getting cold and sticky," he said. "I still can't help but notice how your nipples stand out."</p> <p>"Can you see how long and hard they are?" she asked. "I think I see my breasts poking out about an inch or so."</p> <p>"Sure, I can see that, but I'll be gone much too long when we get back to the truck." he said, taking her hand and placing it on his, sliding it down to his own hard cock through his pants.</p> <p>"Is that what you're doing, getting turned on, rubbing and kissing my body?" she asked, sliding her hand up and down his cock. "Are you so turned on that you want to have your cock inside of me?" she asked, reaching out to wrap her fingers around his hard dick and feeling it throb.</p> <p>"Just look at me, baby. I want you to look, ok? You can touch me if you want to. Please give it to me, baby!" he answered, feeling the heat of her hand.</p> <p>He slipped his pants off and slid down his underwear, taking her hand and sliding it back up to his crotch while he sat back on the bench. "I don't know about your body but I am willing to try anything if you are." he said, laying back against the edge of the bench and looking up at her. "We can do anything we want, baby." he continued. "Just go for it!" she said, pulling her hand away from his cock.</p> <p>"You're so fucking soft when you cum!" he said, running his hands up and down her thighs. "I can't wait to put my cock inside of you!" he said, lifting her leg to put it on him back, sliding his cock inside of her.</p> <p>"I can't wait either," she said, starting to move her hips on him. "Just keep going!" she pleaded, pushing herself back against him and closing her eyes once again. "Just keep going!" she continued, pushing back against him even harder. "Just think about those other things I've told you about," she said, looking over at him. "Tell me if you like what you see. Tell me if you feel how wet my pussy is if you want to stick your cock in me." she continued, sliding her wetness onto his cock.</p> <p>"And," he said, lifting his face to hers. "if you're in a hurry," he added. "You want me to finish myself for you so you can finish him?"</p> <p>"God yes!" she said, pushing her hand up into his hair. "And if that's what it takes, then finish me for you!"</p> <p>"Oh yes," he said, pumping faster and his mouth moving down towards hers. * * * * *</p> <p>He rolled over onto his back, pulling out of her just as she started to wake up. After a few minutes, she sat up and gave him a grin. "Where am I?" she asked, sliding out from the bench. "Where's my clothes?" she asked, slipping on her clothes.</p> <p>"Your clothes," he said, sliding his shirt on. "My shirt I mean, we didn't have any underwear, so there I was getting dressed," he said, reaching in the small drawer as he spoke. "Sorry, I was just going to grab these clothes and put them in your shower." he said, grabbing the clothing.
