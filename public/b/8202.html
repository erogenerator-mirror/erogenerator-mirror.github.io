I sat on one of her bed and pulled her on top of me, my head and shoulder between her legs. She began to rub her clit as she felt me. We kissed slowly and deeply.</p> <p>"I love you, I really love you", she said as we kissed. I smiled, I truly was not in love with her. Our eyes locked as we made love. I wrapped one arm under her back and the other under her neck. She looked so damn sexy with those long hair cascading down her back. She lifted herself up just a little more so I could get fully inside of her, then pushed down hard all the way as a final thrust. It was so intense. I felt her walls tighten as she climaxed. We were both silent for a minute as she caught her breath and said "wow that was intense". "I can't wait to be the same again", she said as she went down on me. I was still fully hard as she mounted me and moved me in a little circle. She started moving again, and the look on her face was like pure lust. We kissed and caressed, I started to move up and down on my dear sweet lover. We were all over the edge and soon both moaned deeply as a climax hit us.</p> <p>After that we lay on top of one another, exhausted, panting, and happy to be together again. I love her so much, I don't know what it is, as we drifted off to sleep againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
