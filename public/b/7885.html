The whole evening was a big deal on one level and we had an enormous amount of money and it looked like we were about to be robbed. And, in a way, all I wanted now was to get home and get my parents out of my room before they started looking at the wall. I wasn't sure I could afford it and I didn't want to seem a whore. The more rational side of my mind suggested that if I was a whore that it didn't matter that I was a rich, attractive old, white woman. I just hadn't thought about that yet and didn't care if we were at a big joint and it didn't matter anyway.</p> <p>My mum, dad and my dad had gone to the pub for a drink and they had left after a few minutes. My mum and she had gone to her room but she had come down to the party and was sat in her room. My dad had stayed outside to wait for them and had gone out when they had gone down. My mum joined me at the bar, told me that she and some friends had decided it was her party and had agreed to join the girls so we could finish and then had walked back to our friends. She told me that her and some of the girls had been looking forward to staying a while and had agreed to stay at the party but they didn't get the chance because they had to leave before I got there. But it was no problem, she had seen my back door and it mustn't have been all that great. She asked me if I had gone out with anyone and I said no. But, she was getting annoyed that I hadn't gone and was asking what I had said when I had gone. She seemed angry and said she wanted to know if I was going to stay in tonight.</p> <p>So, as the evening went on, my mum came to the party with my dad. Everyone had a pint of wine and the girls were dancing. My mum danced with my dad and I just watched them from the bar. They were really happy to see me sitting there and all the noise was so loud. My dad had said that he hoped that I had a friend for the night. We sat there for a while and then the girls took their drinks off and came over to the bar. All the attention was very intense and I felt a little sick. I felt really drunk and all I wanted to do was to get home and get some clean clothes on. But it wasn't my father's fault that I had drank so much.</p> <p>"I think I'm going to get in trouble here" he said as he took his jacket off. "Is your mother up for another dance?"</p> <p>It seemed that my father already knew that he was going to leave the girls alone.</p> <p>"You got me, now let's go!" he shouted and, before I could object, my mum was on her feet and taking my dad's arm again. I couldn't see him so I just followed them out to the dance floor. As I did, I just saw my mum with my dad and saw him walking towards me. He turned his head and looked at me but I could see the fear in his eyes and his face turned bright red and a big smile on. My mum and I danced and we talked during the dance and our conversation turned to music and all things so that no one in the disco would be able to catch us. Of course, the alcohol was starting to have the effect of giving my father and I the courage to leave with that guy.</p> <p>My mum and my dad were still out on the floor and in a minute we were on the floor together. It wasn't the first time I had got out into the night alone and had just been on another dance floor when they returned. I saw that they had put out a light and they had put a CD to our room which I couldn't quite hear. They were dancing up close to the bar and some girl was dancing down the other side of the dance floor with my dad. The girl had stopped dancing with him and was looking straight at me and smiling. She was wearing a really short dress which came to just above her knee and was open at the front so my dad was looking right up her skirt at her thighs. He was looking at me and smiling. He was staring straight at my mum who had her eyes on my dad. I wondered what my mum was thinking as she was looking at me and my dad and watching me. She was looking directly at me and was obviously checking me out. The look on my mum's face was telling me what she was feeling. Then after a while she put her hand on my dad's arm and pulled him close to her. When she leaned her face towards him she gave me a kiss on the lips and told me how much she wantedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
