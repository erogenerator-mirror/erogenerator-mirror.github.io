And it's not like you need any help," I replied, trying to sound annoyed.</p> <p>There was just something about the way I had spoken to her now that she knew it was an illusion. "No, it isn't like that right now," she replied. "I was just wondering how the work was going. I mean, I'm a high school teacher, but I get paid pretty well, and they pay me less than half of what I'm spending at that dance studio. So...it doesn't seem strange if I can help you with anything, is all. But don't worry. I'll try to give you as much help as you need. Come by this afternoon and we can talk for awhile, maybe even make small talk and let me know what the problem is."</p> <p>While I was driving over to talk to her, she was still a bit taken aback about our conversation. "I knew you were not that nice. I mean, not a bad-looking guy. I'm just...welcome to the area and all, but it's been a bit of a busy month." She looked to her left and back at the road.</p> <p>"Well, I'm glad you are looking better now. But I really have to admit that after last night, I really enjoyed the evening, and the way you had your pussy eaten out. And I am still just a bit shocked when I realized that you even came...I mean, you came for me."</p> <p>"Yes, I had to have your cock in me before you made me come, just to let it come easier for you." She looked me in the eyes and gave a sly smile. "You really were a lucky guy, but you really weren't. You've seen the little black lady. And I've had that pussy, I'm sure you know all about that, don't you?" She asked, sounding rather embarrassed.</p> <p>"It's nice to have a girl's opinion on something, isn't it?" I replied. "I just thought... well, you might enjoy it a little more if you took your panties off, if you know what I mean."</p> <p>"Oh, thank you," Katie laughed. "I've wanted to touch myself for a while now. But I just can't. It's been a busy schedule and I've been so damn busy that I missed the most part of the weekend."</p> <p>"Okay, there's no sense in you stopping by and finding out how much more this evening has paid you. And I'm sure you've heard that most of the dance studios are not that expensive."</p> <p>"I have heard that one too. I know I've told some guys that I was a virgin when I got here, but I never did it with one of the guys in the front office. I just never did it in the back. But one day, I have found it, and there are a lot of men in it who really just want to fuck you in front of their wives. Even I couldn't do anything about it, and besides, I'm sure you know all of that. So that's where I go for a short session, but if you don't mind, I could really use a hand."</p> <p>"No, that's okay. The job is pretty easy, you just have to be a little bit less busy. No problem. I'm just glad you are here," she replied, but not too convincingly. And we talked for awhile. I couldn't help but notice that she was trying to make the most of the opportunity that she was offering me. I guess she wasn't too concerned over my little meeting with Karen.</p> <p>Just then, Karen was pulling up outside their apartment. That brought another smile to my face. "What's on your mind, Mike? Is the job really worth it?" she asked, looking at me with the same sly grin that she used to give me when we talked to others over the phone.</p> <p>"As a matter of fact, yes. I thought it might take away some of the stress of the day, so I was surprised to finally come to you today and say yes."</p> <p>"Well, Mike, this is really fun. Why don't you come into the apartment for a drink or two and see exactly what it is that you are interested in?"</p> <p>"Actually, I really need to know if you really mean that. That's not a problem. I'll call Karen and make arrangements to come to work tonight."</p> <p>"Mike, you're not going to do that are you? I mean, you've seen me, I've seen your picture, you know, all ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
