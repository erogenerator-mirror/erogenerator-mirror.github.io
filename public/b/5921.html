She was going to get a few more of the old ones to go home for the summer before taking the ones that she'd been getting for a few months. She had spent the summer looking for some fresh material and she'd gotten a few of the little green beans. They'd become something along with the stuff they'd brought for her trip at the plant when she had gone shopping. There had been a few in the grocery store too. She had found one, and it had grown in her head with the scent. The thing was that it had felt good, and that it had stayed that way. She had found a lot of it at the grocery store while shopping and it had grown on her as well.</p> <p>She had learned to control it with her body and she didn't mind that at all. She liked it more than her other things, but she kept it under her control. That wasn't one of the reasons she had stopped, but it wasn't the reason. She would have made herself a good wife and live in her own world.</p> <p>The phone call had come the first night that Sarah had left. She had been surprised when the caller was at work. On her way home when she'd gotten home she hadn't even noticed the ringtone until now, and it had just kept ringing. She was pissed off, but she didn't feel the need to do anything about it at the time. It would not be like her to call her lover if her needs had been left to her alone.</p> <p>Sarah had taken her lover off and told him about her moods when he had gone to the store. She hadn't meant to upset him, though it was the first thing that was going through her mind when he told her about the car that he had been able to drive for a while when it had died. They had been trying to get her to go back and pick it up for a while, but her mood had remained negative.</p> <p>When he had finally found the car she had been furious. She knew it was an old car. It had been in the car garage and she didn't want to put it in back where she had found him, let alone drive it home. When he had finally called her back she had been able to calm her temper enough to ask him to come over. He had refused, thinking that what she was doing would only cause her to have to go to work, and she had said she would be home until Wednesday. He had said that was too damn late for her. He hadn't even put in for it. For the past few weeks she'd gone out and purchased some gifts for him and they had even bought her some new clothes that he had said he needed to bring home. He had insisted and she had refused saying that he was being stubborn and pushing things she hadn't wanted to do a little early. She hadn't wanted to be there in case he had decided he was pushing things too fast, but he was. She didn't want to admit it though, she had been fighting with him.</p> <p>It was a small thing on her end though, and they had only gotten back to the house the night he had called and she was afraid to come inside since they had decided she didn't feel like spending the night. That was when things had come out different. She couldn't have had a lot of fun since he hadn't made any progress in helping her. They had also gotten more involved when he hadn't tried to initiate the conversations they had gotten back into, and the more they had been in the back of the car, the more she had been afraid of the night coming to an end either.</p> <p>The problem was that she didn't feel like it would be fun to try to break him up. She had been having fun without him, but the past few weeks had been very lonely. She found her moods getting worse as the weeks went by. She felt like she had been playing a dangerous game of cat and mouse with herself now. She was finding herself becoming more and more frustrated. It hadn't been in front of the kids and other people at school either, but it had been at her house during the day. She hadn't really felt like doing anything about it either, but they had gotten a little too far out of control.</p> <p>So she decided to make the long hard drive over to the farm. She had wanted to go there for an hour at most, but it had been her family's anniversary and she had decided to get some of her old stuff and sell it since it was easier to find. Her new things had looked good on that trip. She had started to look forward to the trip since he had taken up her mind. She had enjoyed it and she hadn't been able to stop thinking of him any time soon. That wasn't surprising, as her family was more than likely being in theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
