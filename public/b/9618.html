Her boyfriend, she had to explain, was from the city and had no money. This meant it might be a waste of time before she could get it for him. The next day she explained what she was doing, and said he should have a copy which he would have to keep in case of emergency. Heather was very quiet about this and I guessed I might have a little more to go for now.</p> <p>That weekend arrived and I decided that after a final holiday break I would go to the gym, I needed to get the body. When I had taken a shower, to my horror there was not a drop of hair on my body. Heather had the odd look on her face. She looked so relieved and happy. I had no idea what was wrong with her.</p> <p>"Honey, what's wrong? Why didn't you wear any clothes for the whole weekend?" I pleaded.</p> <p>"There's no way that I'm going to do that. We've got to get a hotel in advance and make it an early one, we would be late." She said, almost as though she was worried about getting into trouble.</p> <p>She started in on herself. "I will not be late for it." She continued and then added, "But if you think it will help my get to the gym." She said, almost whispering. I felt I was in trouble.</p> <p>"Of course it will help you. It is a start. You are still young and attractive and you have got a hot man." I told her, but she didn't respond. I felt a bit strange, there had obviously been a tension between us. I didn't know she hadn't been looking after herself. My mind raced back to the thought of how I had felt when I saw her the other day, and for the first time it came back. I could feel the blood now rushing to my cock, and I began to feel a growing erection as I thought about what she might be wearing.</p> <p>I wasn't really sure why, she might come out at the wrong time, or maybe she just wanted me to come over and help her get her body ready for the gym. Either way I would try to help her get the perfect result.</p> <p>Later that evening I rang her mobile and asked her to speak to her boyfriend. I told her that I didn't want her to stay late. I also didn't want her to tell him that this was all wrong. My mind was racing to think where would things go. I thought that I could make the most of it if she just talked him through it. Then I wondered how much money my dad had paid her before she went off to university.</p> <p>"I guess that I could buy you dinner and help you make your body, then I could give you a job?" Heather said, her voice dripping with sarcasm.</p> <p>"Honey that would be too much. I can't just let you go off on your own. I have to do what feels right. If I can give you the time of your life I could do it. It would be a great start." I said not thinking that she would go to university.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" she said.</p> <p>"Yes, of course." I said. I knew that I shouldn't tell her. There was just no alternative.</p> <p>"You have to be there." She said.</p> <p>"I just got stuck on the phone with my friends about this Friday morning and after a few hours I had to get out. I could use a drink." I said.</p> <p>"Well, then drink it." She said, almost like she was trying to persuade me with her response.</p> <p>I was glad we had discussed the idea. It had been good talking to her earlier but now it was time to make the most of it.</p> <p>Once out in the pub I set up an evening of work in my mind. I tried to sort this out in my mind whilst trying to calm myself down. I tried to forget Heather's problem with the guys before she made anything permanent. I tried to get her to think that perhaps I had a solution, that I could help out with her body. Then I tried to see if I could solve Heather's problem.</p> <p>There was a party that weekend. I put on my best clothes, a pair of trousers and a blouse and had an all over tan. I had on a tie and as I always liked the effect when I got a tan I went shopping in town. I had decided to wait for about the two hundred and fifty dollars I would be getting, but when I got to Heather's home that night I didn't know exactly when I might be getting my reward.</p> <p>In my experience women are never at such an age when they are so vulnerableâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
