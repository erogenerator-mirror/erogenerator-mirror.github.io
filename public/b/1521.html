I replied.</p> <p>I looked over to the other room. "This is my bedroom," she said. "I hope your not scared."</p> <p>She reached out her hand, "I'm not scared!" I said, a little nervous.</p> <p>"Well maybe not actually," she added. "I've been looking for your first time in a couple of weeks. I'm going to let us finish this off quickly, but you'll understand. Right now your pussy is screaming at me."</p> <p>"I'm not scared!" she said in desperation. "It's your first time! Are you sure you want to do this? You're the one who was with me last time. It's just.... "</p> <p>"Ok. I'm ready," I said.</p> <p>She took my hand, and led me into her bedroom. There, there's where you have to walk...</p> <p>"This way," she said, leading me around the bed towards the center, and a door to the right of her own. As I started to pass by her, I could hear movement behind us.</p> <p>"Not now," she said, "not really. This is for your first time."</p> <p>"Let's start with a kiss," I said.</p> <p>"Ok," she said, with a wiggle of her butt.</p> <p>She stepped closer and reached out, took my hand, and pulled me to her. We stood there, looking down at each other. It was a moment of passion and lust, and I was in the middle of it. She put her hands on my face, pulling and licking the tip of my tongue. It felt divine. I could taste my own cum. It made my entire existence tingle. I started to reach out for her again, when she took an ankle and pulled me close. We stood there, kissing, for what seemed like an eternity. She started to move her hips to match the motion of my hips, pushing my cock gently to the side. It was a perfect fit.</p> <p>My hands touched her body. She was still clothed, but her body was all wetter now - she had been leaking juices on me for a while, which is why I was so eager to touch her. My hands moved slowly down her body, over her ass, and gently felt her damp skin. She moved her hand behind my head, and pulled me towards her. I gently laid her on her back, our lips not parting. I was on my knees again, she moved herself on the floor, and my back was rubbing against her firm butt.</p> <p>"I want it!" she said. My cock pulsed.</p> <p>This took my breath away. I couldn't remember any woman ever saying this to me ever. She was really on fire. She took my hands, and placed them on her chest. "No!" she said. "That's your first time! This is your first time. You were with me before, and we already finished."</p> <p>"But why?" I whispered. "Why did you want to be with me?"</p> <p>"You have to promise to follow my lead in this, please!" she added. "Now that you have your first taste of me, you'll really love it."</p> <p>"But, I have to do this," I said.</p> <p>"What?" she asked, raising her hand towards me.</p> <p>"I want to kiss you," I said, "right here."</p> <p>She slowly and hesitantly moved her lips to mine and kissed me. It was heavenly. Our tongues danced together. She backed away several minutes, letting the passion build. When she kissed me again, she grabbed me by the back of the neck, and pulled me towards her.</p> <p>My hands found their way to her body. I slowly caressed her body from neck to thigh, while my tongue worked its way to her clit. She had taught me to love women with no inhibitions, but she also took me a little rough with my hair. At this point, things were getting hotter. I wanted to make love to a sexy woman, and I also didn't want to rush this. She was wet, and ready. We kissed for a few minutes. I was getting hot, and she was getting hotter. We could both smell her excitement. "Get on your knees on the floor," she said, smiling.</p> <p>I was getting hot, but she was really turned on. So I slid myself into her awaiting wetness. I didn't get far, because I pushed her up against the door, and started to fuck her hard. Our bodies met as my cock drove into her with each stroke. I could feel our juices gâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
