"There are plenty more things you can wear," he said to me.</p> <p>We laughed and he took my shirt off, leaving me looking like a school girl, which I guess you would say was fine with me. He got me undressed, which seemed unnecessary considering I had just gotten naked. When he was as naked as I was, he was right on top of me. He started to rub it on my body, my arms, my back, and my breasts, and I sighed in anticipation of it all. His hands got me to sit up with his dick pressed right against my breasts.</p> <p>"That's the way it's supposed to be," he said. "They're made especially for each other."</p> <p>"I thought you said that was all part of your... relationship?" I asked, confused.</p> <p>"Not exactly," he said. "But it feels the least I could do. As much as I want you to be happy, I feel you need that," he said. "It's a lot less than we'd like."</p> <p>I didn't know what to do, so I just went with it. "What does it feel like?" I asked.</p> <p>"You know, the kind of things you really like," said David.</p> <p>"Like what?"</p> <p>"Like... how soft, how different, and how hot it is to touch you."</p> <p>"Well," I said, "I like everything else."</p> <p>"Really," he said, "So now I'm going to be on top."</p> <p>And as David pulled his dick out of my pussy, it seemed as if my body was giving me a thrill inside. I was actually trembling with excitement, so excited it was as if I wanted it all over again.</p> <p>"Okay," I said, finally, "But I don't know if my own juices can hold it back. It seems like it's time to give me a few chances to catch myself."</p> <p>David looked over at the camera, but I could feel his dick throbbing slightly in the palm of his hand, making it look just like my own had been when I touched it to him earlier, when I was in a trance.</p> <p>"Do what comes naturally," he said, his voice just as steady, "But take it slow at first... be careful with the first strokes. When this happens, just try to just keep it in your hand."</p> <p>As I started to come down from my high, I started to realize my body was going to go through a change as well, it never really felt like it had before, except now I was getting turned on. I wanted David to give me this. I really wanted this. I just wanted his dick inside me the whole time. In fact, when I looked down my mouth felt as though it felt numb and I was starting to cry.</p> <p>"I..." I said.</p> <p>"Shhhh," he said, "Just try to get yourself under control."</p> <p>Suddenly, there was a knock and it sent my eyes wide. My body twitched with excitement as my breathing hitched. I opened my eyes and saw my boyfriend waiting for me. He was wearing a tight, grey button-up shirt and a little blue bowtie that I'd never seen before, which looked like some sort of wedding ring. His shirt was tied around his neck, and I could see his skin under the shirt. He looked great. I didn't actually think I'd do anything on the spot, but I couldn't seem to resist, so I just let him stare for a while. He was looking right at me, his eyes fixed on my face. He was clearly in love with me.</p> <p>The first words out of his mouth happened to be a bit breathless and, as he looked me up and down, he said, "So hot," before he leaned in. I just looked in total shock as he put his arms around me, one around my stomach and the other just below my boobs. He was gently pulling me to him, and when I didn't want him to pull me, my legs came together behind his back as though I was trying to pull him in too. I was now really confused.</p> <p>It was still awkward to do this, but the feeling of his body against mine was electric.
