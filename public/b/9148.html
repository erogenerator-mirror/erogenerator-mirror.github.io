No..."</p> <p>"Nuhhh, I'm not sure. I told you to say what you were thinking. Do I not have to say what you are feeling, or do you want me to stop?"</p> <p>"Nooo!" She said loudly, then hung up.</p> <p>I stood and watched her as she picked up the phone and dialed the information. I heard her groan in frustration as she turned to me and I could see the desperation in her eyes.</p> <p>"Oh god..."</p> <p>"Honey..." My dad's voice trailed off.</p> <p>"Mom... I..."</p> <p>My dad gave her an exasperated look.</p> <p>"She was getting so horny, and for no reason, her little head was screaming for me to make up a wager and stop her."</p> <p>"Fuck her Mom!" Emily shot at him. "Let her have it! She needs to take her medicine!"</p> <p>"I don't know, baby. I think she's really stressed."</p> <p>"So... I think she needs a new place. Maybe a new boyfriend or a new car! What do you think?"</p> <p>My dad shook his head.</p> <p>"If you don't want a new place, don't take too long to put it in a drawer."</p> <p>Emily sat on her bed and sighed softly.</p> <p>"I am so stressed! I haven't dated in three years, and when I finally did, I really didn't know how to act or even how to act around people. Now I'm worried, and I want sooo much to go."</p> <p>"Honey," Dad's voice trailed off as she looked at him. "Would you ever want to go alone again?"</p> <p>"Oh yes, but I think I may be a little overstressed. I want to go back. I want to see what my life is like, and to have a new job and to be happy again. I just might do it someday."</p> <p>I saw him take the phone away from her.</p> <p>"Are you in your room, yet?"</p> <p>"No sweetheart, I'm not in my room, or I'm not doing anything. Just go get dressed and we'll go out to dinner."</p> <p>I watched her walk across the living room to the bedroom and heard the swish of her tight jeans as I took my shoes off. She turned and looked at me.</p> <p>"What are you thinking?" She asked, her body moving back up to mine.</p> <p>"I'm thinking about moving in with you."</p> <p>"Do you want to have sex with me?"</p> <p>I could feel my heart thudding in my chest.</p> <p>"How could I possibly say no to you?"</p> <p>"I think I might have better luck than you think." Emily's smile was all that I saw of hers. We stood there, looking each other.</p> <p>"Come in, take off my clothes."</p> <p>I saw some things she had said before to me that even she had said that she couldn't have done this on her own, but I saw what she had said and saw the truth in it. I watched her take the last clothes off, then she picked up her bra and began removing her pajama pants as we stood there, facing each other. Emily had always been a curvy woman and her hips and breasts were still beautifully shaped. She had large full breasts and the waist of her pants barely seemed to go down to her knees. I'd looked to see if she had a tiny waist, as her pants were a deep, rich, almost black, satin. It seemed that she wore something that fit her nicely, even if she didn't wear panties. It would serve very well as a matching to her shoes. She was very aware of her body, but still kept it self-consciously modest, so there was no point in looking at it. Now that we were in this relationship, it was her job to find ways to draw this out and maintain it. She made it a point to keep to herself.</p> <p>"Baby, I want you to strip for me."</p> <p>"But you're my boyfriend..." Emily said softly as her gaze wandered to my hard cock pressing against the silky fabric of my pants.</p> <p>"I know, sweetheart, and I can't help myself. You're so beautiful, and I want to love you."</p> <p>"Go on Daddy, undress me. Take your clothes off!"</p> <p>"Why... why aren't we going to...? I mean, I want to see your body, and make love with you! I don't know what to think!"</p> <p>"Come on!" Emily said, lifting her arms up to me. "Do it!"</p> <p>Emily stepped forward, turning to face meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
