I replied, still looking down at my body. "That is, if you don't mind?"</p> <p>She smiled and nodded, slipping the strap of her dress off from her shoulder. It fell to the floor leaving her in nothing but a skimpy white bra and matching thong. The top of her cleavage was visible and I wondered how they would feel if I was to lean in for a kiss. "Oh, I don't seem to have much to wear," Sarah said, "so I guess I'll just have to find out for myself."</p> <p>My heart was pounding in my chest and I could feel my pussy starting to throb. It was as if I hadn't just come in my pants. Sarah's cleavage was in full force, her nipples straining against the fabric of her bra, pointing toward the ceiling.</p> <p>"Well, let's see what I'm looking for." I said, stepping over to her and picking up one of the tiny, black panties, which would go perfectly with her bra.</p> <p>Sarah's eyes lit up, catching the thin, silky material and I smiled. "This will be fun, huh?" I asked, stepping closer. I reached out and cupped her face, taking her mouth with mine. Her eyes were wide and her lips were parted. Her breathing was slow and steady and her skin was smooth and sweet where the fabric barely grazed her breast. She was wearing tiny little black heels, which I could barely make out against the tight dress. Sarah's body was perfect. In her heels, I could see that she was slim, shapely and quite gorgeous.</p> <p>I had never done this with a guy, but it was fun. And I knew the rest of her body well. I just wanted to be sure she wouldn't do anything that could make her jealous. So, I pulled her gently to me, taking her in my arms and kissing her. The kiss was filled with passion and she parted her lips invitingly. Her kiss was firm and demanding. And it lasted for a long time. I felt myself returning the passionate kiss as if I'd been there long enough.</p> <p>After our kiss, we separated and we sat back down on the sofa, hands on each other's waist. We were still sitting on the carpet in front of the sofa, and, as we were both breathing hard and fast, I slipped off my heels and undid Sarah's bra, sliding it down over her slender shoulders and letting it drop to the floor. I then leaned forward and gently rested my hands on her bare breasts, feeling her hard nipples as they poked out against the fabric. I kissed her nipples through the thin fabric and she gasped. "You do have lovely breasts," I smiled, my words barely audible. Sarah's eyes were open and she smiled at me.</p> <p>I took one of her large, soft breasts in my hand that I could feel hard through her bra and felt her nipple. Sarah had her hair in her hands, and I felt her gently caressing the palm of my hand. Her body was so small, so delicate, and so smooth, like someone had just stepped out of the bathroom. The thought made me nervous and I wondered if she was wearing a nightgown. I looked down at her breasts, and then back into her eyes.</p> <p>"Are you getting aroused?" I asked. Sarah nodded her head, and I reached over, taking her nipple between my thumb and forefinger and gently squeezing. Sarah gasped again, but I could feel her nipples hardening.</p> <p>"Do you want me to make you feel that?" I asked, pulling her towards me and kissing her deeply yet again. I felt Sarah's tongue slide into my mouth, and she pulled me tight with her hands on my breasts, pressing my body against hers. I pulled my mouth away and looked into her eyes, her gaze fixed on mine. I wanted her so badly. "I want it to be you that does it. Do it," I whispered, my words barely audible. "Do it."</p> <p>Sarah kissed me back, her lips hard against mine. She was the softest flower, I thought to myself. I pulled her in, pressing my body firmly against hers as my hands moved to her back, feeling how firm and smooth her body felt beneath mine. She pressed herself into me, and I could feel a subtle tremor in her as our mouths pressed together.</p> <p>Sarah's hands caressed my back, running down my back, across my stomach and down to my buttocks. I reached and kneaded them through my own dress. My own nipples felt a tiny little pain, but I couldn't help myself; I wanted to feel it against Sarah's breasts, her body, that wonderful body to which I had just been introduced. Sarah broke our embrace long enough to turn around to face me.
