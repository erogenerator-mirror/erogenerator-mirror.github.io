"He might not give me any more." Cindy said. "How did you think it would go?"</p> <p>Karen's heart pounded in her chest. "I don't know." She hesitated. "At first I thought you liked it. Then...." Her voice wavered as she began to answer. "Then.....I think the more."</p> <p>"But how did you get you ass there?" Karen said, "and if you enjoyed it, what did you do." Cindy didn't answer, but she had to.</p> <p>"Well......" Cindy answered. "I did it at the bar. I even did a hot tub. Then...." She stopped short. "Then.....I did the pool."</p> <p>"The pool?" Karen asked, "so you had sex in the pool...." Cindy's eyes went even wider with her surprise.</p> <p>"Yes." Karen was still silent as her face reddened. "Karen!"</p> <p>Cindy's face changed to a serious expression. "Yes." She said again. "Okay you asked for a hot tub, I got in on Saturday. It wasn't all that great. I found a little out of the way place and enjoyed a bit, but by tomorrow......" Cindy's voice trailed off. "The next day......" Her voice trailed off even more.</p> <p>Cindy could tell she was going to do it. "Fuck?" She said. "But it wasn't a hot tub, was it?" As she said the word `fuck' to Karen her fingers moved over her nipple. "I knew you said the next day. That's why I had to wear these tight little shorts." She pulled her nipples as if they were trying to escape from the tight material. "And what if I did that? Would it make you hard? Would it make me excited? Would it make you horny? Would your cock get hard?" She took a sip of water as she finished the sentence. Karen's heart was beating rapidly.</p> <p>Karen was trembling with excitement and fear. Her heart was pounding. Slowly Cindy's mind cleared and she said "No....." Then her eyes started back into view and looked Karen in the eye. When Cindy didn't say anything she asked calmly "Are you asking if you could fuck me now? Do you want me to suck you hard cock then?"</p> <p>Cindy just nodded. Her mind was racing. She was going to ask, but she didn't know how. That's why the big question was; did she or didn't she want to? It must have seemed like an eternity before Cindy's mind registered as if it was already past the time Karen had just said the word 'swat'. "Please...." Cindy's mind said, wanting to be more than a sexual fantasy. It was time for her response. "You're so sexy..... I like your body. Please fuck me."</p> <p>Cindy had hesitated. Her mind was racing, trying to put her hands on her breasts, but her mind was racing even more as she spoke. "Then I'll do it ........"</p> <p>Karen moved to the counter and picked up two large plastic bowls. She set one on the cabinet top and set the other on Cindy's side of the counter. At first Cindy had thought "what the hell.....?" but Karen quickly had her lie down on the sink counter, legs spread with one leg bent at the knee. She quickly bent her leg at the knee and then pulled it to the side, giving her pussy a little lick.</p> <p>"Are....you.....ready?" She heard Cindy say. Her mind was still racing. "Should I...." Karen stopped herself. She was so damn horny she just about had to say "Fuck me". "Please...." She heard Cindy's voice pleading. She was just about to say 'no'.</p> <p>Karen knelt on the sink counter between Cindy's legs, lifted one of Cindy's legs so that she was sitting on the counter with her knees up. She reached down, grabbing Cindy's ass with both hands and pulled her crotch to her mouth. Karen's lips touched the hard nubbin of Cindy's pussy, and then her tongue slithered over it.</p> <p>Cindy moaned, "Ohhhh!" Her hips moved up, pulling her pussy onto Karen's mouth. Karen's body was quivering, reacting to the first touches of Cindy's tongue to her pussy. Her head began to move downward, pushing it's way between Cindy's legs. Her body quivered as she lifted her ass, moving her crotch, letting out a soft moan.</p> <p>Cindy started, her hips moving toward the edge of the counter. "Ohhh...." She said at the same time. Karen's mouth closed over the hard nubbin of Cindy's pussy, holding it and then squeezing it as Cindy's hips thrust against Karen'sâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
