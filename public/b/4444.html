"As of late no less than six hours back there. It's always early so you've got time to get ready... and I'm taking great pleasure in doing the same for you. Now go put your costume and makeup on, then make yourself up. If you're good you might even get a chance to talk to my son again later," Buffy said.</p> <p>"Willie you... will you help?" Buffy asked with a pout.</p> <p>Willie answered. "Sure mom... just do it for me," he finished, "just put that over there. I can be the best friend you can, and if the truth be known, I'm more than happy to help you," he joked, laughing.</p> <p>*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p> <p></p> <p>Buffy was still having trouble getting dressed, all those feelings had been stirred up by being the best friend she could be. She had never felt so protected, so loved when she was with a friend as she was back at home. Even she knew her reputation in the neighborhood wasn't nearly as good as it was in Sunnydale, her family was all too familiar with it and the feeling she felt when everyone was watching her wasn't lost on her. She couldn't help comparing Sunnydale with Sunnydale. It couldn't be any different than Sunnydale, and she was glad she wanted to see it.</p> <p>"I can't go there, I don't know what's going on, I'm not supposed to go," Buffy said with apprehension.</p> <p>"No way," Willow said with a laugh.</p> <p>"I guess... I guess it'll have to be for me, won't it?" Buffy begged.</p> <p>"Sure it is. He's my grandson, it's way too early for that, it will seem weird to be here all the time, but it'll be nice for you," Buffy said.</p> <p>"I'm not sure, I don't want to make you feel like he is the reason you're here, I'm not used to being the centre of attention in the city. But if you really want to go," Willow said, "you can, and I'll talk to him on the way out of the club as soon as you've finished putting your costume on. I got the same thing," she assured her.</p> <p>Buffy just smiled as she said goodbye. "Goodbye, and remember what I said about helping you get ready?"</p> <p>"I really hope so... I'll see you later, be back by midnight," she said, but with a playful frown.</p> <p>Buffy went inside the club and quickly took a seat at Miguel's piano box as Willow's son came in from the back.</p> <p>She just sat there while Jeneda showed her son the latest songs of popular music. It was as much for him as for Buffy. He didn't seem concerned by the fact that he was in the midst of a bad day, he just seemed happy to be helping his mother with her favorite pastime.</p> <p>She was almost relieved when she heard his voice. It was a mixture of emotions. Jeneda had been worried that she might not be able to stand a bad day with her son, and she had hoped that he'd be able to give her what she obviously needed in her life. She didn't expect the moment to last.</p> <p>Instead of taking her seat, he led her into the middle of the stage as he sat down. He took a slow sip of the wine before he took a seat beside Buffy.</p> <p>"Where is my son, I must speak with you," he said.</p> <p>"I'm not sure if, he can take me backstage, or should I call Giles now?" Buffy asked. Jeneda had been so excited to get to meet him, to finally meet him.</p> <p>"No no no no not today I just wanted to get a chance after work. I've got to get to the shop, this is just a few minutes," Giles explained, putting on his signature songbook.</p> <p>"I'm so glad you're here. It makes me really feel good to be here," Buffy said, wishing she could smile at the thought of him as she held his gaze as the music began.</p> <p>"I really am just waiting for an opportunity to call you, that's all. I feel better now about having your support," Jeneda replied.</p> <p>Buffy just nodded as she watched him play for several minutes.</p> <p>"So... about the future," she asked, wishing she could say the same thing, but for a different purpose. She wanted to stay and see what was going to happen with her son.</p> <p>Willow answered. "Well, I was planning onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
