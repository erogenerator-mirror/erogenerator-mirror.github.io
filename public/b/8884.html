"You're not wearing a bra, are you?" He asked.</p> <p>"Well...yes." She replied.</p> <p>"No panties?" He asked. He hoped she did not realize that she had not worn that outfit in several years.</p> <p>"Yeah...I wore this outfit in my class a year ago." She replied. "Maybe you can help me change." She continued in that sexy, breathy voice.</p> <p>"My place or yours?"</p> <p>"Mine." She said and they kissed deeply and passionately.</p> <p>"Okay, you go shower."</p> <p>She smiled and kissed him again. He had never been with another girl before and he couldn't wait to begin a new level of lovemaking.</p> <p>"I have a present for you." She stated.</p> <p>He moved her to the dresser and picked out a sexy sheer body stocking that he had purchased years before on a whim. Once she was done in the bathroom he stepped up close to her.</p> <p>"Here's the present you deserve." She said as she held it in front of his face.</p> <p>"I couldn't help myself when you had my dick in your mouth just before graduation."</p> <p>"I would have never done anything like that for you." She whispered.</p> <p>"I hope you weren't disappointed that I didn't get my turn first."</p> <p>He smiled at her and leaned in to kiss her. He was pleased with himself too. Kissing a sexy girl and making her hot.</p> <p>After he kissed her, he grabbed a pair of black high heels. She was in the shower when he returned. He went to the bedroom to put his present on and looked at the new outfit on the bed. He loved the way it felt on her body.</p> <p>"Let's see if we can make this sexy." She said as she ran her hands all over her body. "Are yours as sexy as mine?" She asked.</p> <p>He knew that he would have to wait. He got naked while she went to shower. Once she started the water he got under the shower too and they got in the shower together.</p> <p>"I'm going to wash your hair," he told her. "You can put your hair away, if that's what excites you."</p> <p>She let him wash her hair for a minute. It was fun to wash her hair on a guy's cock and balls. She loved that. They finished up in the shower and got dressed the sexy lingerie. They looked great in the tight, sexy set he was hoping to spend the rest of his life wearing.</p> <p>He went into his study to finish his paper. He had to look for another present to put to her, but that could wait. He wasn't going to waste time getting her things. He went to her closet to pick out her new dress for her. After pulling it out he looked around the closet.</p> <p>"I have a dress in here that would make a beautiful young girl." He thought to himself.</p> <p>"Oh my God! This is really sexy, but I'm not sure if I can wear this." He thought.</p> <p>He picked out one that would fit her body and made her sexy in it. It was about mid-thigh and went down to mid-thigh. It had a plunging neck and full, full bottom that showed her toned legs. The skirt was slit up to just below her hips. The top was really thin and flowed up to just below her breasts. The neckline dipped lower so he could see the curve of her breasts and he loved the way the bodice hugged her. The top was only two inches wide and would show her flat stomach and cleavage.</p> <p>"Oh!" She said when she saw him standing there looking and then noticed and then turned away quickly.</p> <p>"What is that for?" He asked.</p> <p>"To make you look pretty...like a sexy, young woman." She told him.</p> <p>"Wow" Was all he could reply with.</p> <p>Once they were finished changing, they went to her desk and sat down to lunch. They were going to buy it tomorrow. They had decided to just get together and see if that would happen.</p> <p>They were done and out for lunch the following morning when they arrived at his apartment.</p> <p>"Let's go down to the park," she said as the kiss continued between them. She walked in front of him and they sat down on each other's laps.</p> <p>She looked at his face as she leaned into him and kissed him. He could see how hard she nipples were. "You're turning me on." She told him.</p> <p>She held his cock which jumped even more when he felt herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
