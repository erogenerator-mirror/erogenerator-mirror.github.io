You have to love the way they taste, don't you?"</p> <p>I moaned and moved my head to suck her right tit. My tongue swirled around her nipple, and I felt it harden under my tongue. Moving down to the left one, I sucked it in again, loving the way the flesh of her breast and the way her long, straight blonde hair fell over my mouth. Moving back up to the right one, I kissed and sucked it. I moved my hand from her legs to caress her inner thighs, and she spread them a little, then a little farther, opening up her pussy to my fingers.</p> <p>I moved up over her and ran my tongue over her lips, and she opened a little, pressing her hips up. I slid my finger in her again, and worked it back and forth a little, then up into her. She moaned a little under her breath and pushed down against my hand, moaning in my ear that she was ready for more.</p> <p>I moved back down and licked her pussy for a minute, savoring the sweetness of her, then brought my head down for a kiss with more passion and passion, while my hands caressed her ass. She kissed my lips softly and ran her fingers in my hair, pulling me down to her and into her, and moving back up to bite my lower lip between her teeth. I broke the kiss and said I loved how wet she made her, that she loved knowing that she made me so horny that she could do anything she wanted me to do to her. I smiled and moved up to kiss her again, and moved back down to her nipple.</p> <p>I felt her pussy start to move in response to my tongue and lips, which started to speed up. I took her nipples between my fingers and teased them some, then kissed down between them to her belly button. She moaned once again, then bit her lower lip hard. She pulled at my shoulders and my neck muscles and I got back on her.</p> <p>I looked at her and saw her eyes flitting between my face and mine. "Make me come, baby, and I'm going to suck it for you."</p> <p>"Yes, Baby, make me come, and suck my pussy until you make me explode with yours!”</p> <p>I moved back down between her legs and felt her pussy heat up a second time, then began to kiss and work my way slowly down to her navel, where I could hear her breathing getting heavier. I kissed around her belly button, then my tongue teased it gently, then I began to kiss it again, licking it, sucking on it, moving down, then down again to her pussy.</p> <p>I teased one with my tongue, and she gasped into my ear and spread her legs a little farther. She said, “Oh, God, baby, I’m cumming! Yes! Eat my pussy juice,” she moaned, and I began to lick her pussy harder and faster. I got my finger into her again and worked it around her clit, and she arched her back and began to gasp and moan. I pulled my finger out and slid it back in her pussy as she started to shudder.</p> <p>Her pussy tightened around my finger and she grabbed my head, and held it there for a moment as she came again. My mouth moved up to her belly button and I kissed it softly, and then back down to her pussy. She said, “Oh, yes, baby, yes, make me come again," and that made my pussy convulse with delight and I knew she’d gone off again.</p> <p>“That was wonderful," I said as I ran my finger slowly round and around her pussy.</p> <p>"You like having me make you feel so good, baby?"</p> <p>“Yes. Don’t stop.”</p> <p>“It’s almost enough,” she said, and then laughed. “That was one of our favorite things.”</p> <p>We kissed softly for a while.</p> <p>"I love you," she said, as she kissed me and lay back on the bed.</p> <p>I lay down next to her and we cuddled a little, kissing each as we lay there side by side. I felt someone kissing me, and she put her hand on my thigh and moved closer. She kissed me on the cheek.</p> <p>She then reached out and stroked my face with a hand.</p> <p>"You’re beautiful," she whispered and kissed me. She laid her head down on my chest. Then she moved down and put her hand on my cock, feeling how hard it was. I looked over at her and saw her looking at my cock.</p> <p>She started massaging it lightly and I could feel it getting harder.</p> <p>"Lie on your back—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
