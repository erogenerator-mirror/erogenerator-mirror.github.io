She looked at him. Her eyes were red from crying. "What happened was horrible, I should have never let it happen. It was one of my biggest mistakes. I can't imagine my life without him."</p> <p>"You can't, because that's not who you are. Why aren't you still at home. The police took my statement last night. You haven't answered that one yet." He pulled her hair back, letting it fall over her shoulders and onto her breast, where the shirt had once been so perfectly unzipped. His hand moved over the soft skin underneath. "Look," he said as he squeezed it, "You need my help. You need to know where you stand with men. I think you would be better off going down there, and making love to a man you've always loved."</p> <p>Her head was held up as she looked at him. "Please?" She nodded. "Please," he said. She was crying, tears streaming down her cheeks. "This is the way I thought things would be. You're my wife and I love you. It was wrong."</p> <p>He smiled. She looked so pretty when she cried. He squeezed her hair closer to the top of her head, exposing her neck. "I would do anything for you. Anything you ask of me. If you think you can forgive me, you have to forgive me."</p> <p>"No, please don't." Her cries were louder than the last words she spoke, but his voice sent shivers down her spine. "I don't want to give you your hopes and desires, that you will be able to be happy without me. I've known all along. We have to give ourselves some stability. I've had a lot of good times."</p> <p>He nodded, but the corners of his mouth were turning up to the corners of his mouth. He smiled and touched the side of her face. "You're just like all of those other women that I've been with: not just physically, you can be a woman for a living, but emotionally? You don't even know the difference?"</p> <p>She nodded, but there was nothing she could do for him. "I've never done anything like that with a man before, I've only had sex with women."</p> <p>He frowned. "That's wrong."</p> <p>"I'll try," she said as she looked up at him, tears still forming in her eyes. "I'm still your wife. I'll talk to you if you'll help me."</p> <p>"Of course. Anything for you, sweetheart," he replied.</p> <p>He kissed her cheek and stepped closer to her, moving her hair away from her neck, letting his warm breath on her skin. She closed her eyes, taking all of him in, as her hand went behind her neck to grip his lower back, as her other hand rubbed over it at the same time; she was kissing him back. She could feel his body heat against hers as his arms came out around to rest on the back of her bare shoulders. Her own heat made them both want to feel better. She moaned as they kissed. He could feel her trembling and her fingers rubbed over his back. She broke the kiss and looked up at him, tears still there.</p> <p>Shocked, he stepped back from her. "What's wrong?" He asked.</p> <p>"I can't." She looked at him. "No, stop." But he couldn't stop her, not with such a tender touch. He pulled back, and she felt herself slipping away from him. "I... I can't give you the same level of trust as the men I've been with. I...I'm your... my husband." Tears started to fall from her eyes.</p> <p>His eyebrows rose and his eyes narrowed. "Don't you know that?"</p> <p>"I... I don't care. I don't care! I'd do anything for you."</p> <p>"Then what's the problem?" His voice took on a little bit of anger.</p> <p>"Your sex talk was just wrong," she answered honestly. "It's my turn now. I'm the wife you needed not because you wanted to be with a woman."</p> <p>He sighed. "I'm sorry," he said. She nodded, as he kissed her cheek again. He brought her onto her front and let her fall back onto the bed. He sat next to her, feeling his body tingle and sweat from the night before he'd lost control, and then came.</p> <p>"Thank you," she said. "You did that for me. I really didn't have the heart to leave the world of men alone." He had to chuckle at that, because she seemed to be right. Maybe he should have. He didn't understand how a woman could let herself fall so deeply in love with another manâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
