"I want to see you undress, and then look you in the eye. When we get to the bedside table, I want you to stand up."</p> <p>"I don't do this often," he admitted. "It's not my thing."</p> <p>"I want you to make sure you're not a little old compared to me," she reminded him. "But I'd like to know how you are."</p> <p>"It's a lot harder to walk now that I've got your mother and father to deal with than it once it's you," he sighed thoughtfully.</p> <p>"I don't blame you. I guess I've learned from my mistakes," she said as the two of them headed off towards the bedroom.</p> <p>After pulling her mother into the bathroom with them, Ashley opened the door to his room. He stepped inside and found her standing in front of the full-length mirror on the wall. He dropped the towel she was lying on the floor, stepped into it, and pulled her onto the bed. She wrapped herself around him as they kissed. As his hands made their way to her breasts, she reached down and began undoing his shirt.</p> <p>He groaned as he slipped a hand down to caress her ass, which was now glistening with a film of sweat. He squeezed it, making her moan and squirm under his hands. He dropped to his knees and pulled off his shirt and undershirt then crawled on the bed next to her. She wrapped her arms around him, and he rolled to his back and pulled her to him.</p> <p>He rolled her onto her back and kissed her, their tongues dancing together. Then he laid claim on her mouth, his hard cock pressing up into her belly. She gasped as their bodies met, their mouths still locked together.</p> <p>He broke off the embrace and lowered his head to her breast. Her own breathing quickened as he blew on the hardened nub of her nipple. He squeezed her other breast firmly, massaging them in his hands, before returning to the nipple to suck it. She arched her back towards his mouth and moaned as she felt his tongue flick her nipple. The kiss and touch increased as she felt herself melting into him.</p> <p>His hand slowly made its way down, over her stomach, and up to her pussy. She parted her legs a bit to allow access to her swollen clit. She felt his finger rub it, and felt a wave of wetness hit her. It made her ache for him. Her tongue reached down, seeking his mouth. He felt her hips press up against his hand as he slipped a finger into her wetness.</p> <p>She arched her back and moaned loudly as she felt him enter her. She pressed her hips up harder against his hand, seeking his penetration. He slid another finger into her and she responded passionately. She felt herself begin to feel light headed as her pleasure grew. She heard herself moan and gasped. She needed him, in her mouth, on her pussy.</p> <p>She felt his muscles contract around his fingers as he sent another shockwave of ecstasy straight through her quivering body. She felt the warmth spread into her toes as her orgasm grew within her. She arched her back more, her lips curving into a smile.</p> <p>He felt his own excitement grow and his cock throb. It was like his desire for her, and for them, was more intense than he'd ever felt, much less dreamed. His cock twitched, and he felt that much harder. He brought his mouth down a bit further, and moved his fingers from her as she started to buck into his hand. He pushed his fingers deep into her, and found her g-spot. He continued to rub it, and with a shudder, he felt her body convulse in his hand.</p> <p>She felt herself being shaken as her orgasm crashed over her. Her body was aflame, but also quelled as she felt his fingers inside her. She felt him move a while, then heard him pulling them out of her. She arched her back again with the loss of sensation, but he kept stroking her pussy. She could see a large wet spot on the bed between her legs where he had been kneeling.</p> <p>"I never want him to stop," she whispered, and he heard her words as she moved the blanket and pillows off the bed as well.</p> <p>He crawled up, his hard cock still buried inside her, and she rolled onto her side and took hold of it in her hand. She rolled with him on his side again, but with her head still on his shoulder and her face close to his.</p> <p>"I love you," she said. "So much. I love you too. But don't. That's not for me to decide. Do youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
