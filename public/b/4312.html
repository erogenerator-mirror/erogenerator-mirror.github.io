We were now a tight pair, one side of the tub with him on the edge, as my arms went around his neck and we kissed and fondled all the while, the passion and intensity of the moment and how he felt about the act so completely unselfishly added to our pleasure.</p> <p>In between kisses I managed to whisper, "Honey... I think we should take this a bit further... right now."</p> <p>"Huh... I guess?"</p> <p>There was a glint in his eye and then he gently guided my hand off his groin and under his suit pants. He had an absolutely perfect and tight package and, without any assistance, I felt and found a certain hardness. I stroked it up and down, which felt wonderful and I was careful not to squeeze too hard, before taking hold of his shaft that had grown to its full size. I started to stroke, gently at first but then picking up the pace, getting him as hard as a rock while we watched one girl doing another from across the room.</p> <p>"Oh, baby, you're so hard too!"</p> <p>"Just being here is making me soooo wet," I declared as he took hold of my hand around his hardness and started guiding it up and down.</p> <p>"This is just the beginning, sweetie. There is so much more to this than that."</p> <p>His hands were on the inside of my thighs again, spreading me in a way that made me feel so vulnerable while he started to slowly massage my cunt with just the outer area of his thumb. I could feel how wet and warm my labia were, and I wondered if there could be anything more there because I was feeling such a warm feeling. I thought of how tight the lips of my pussy were, and wondered if he would take them out for me. We were still fully coupled, but my eyes were still closed now and my breathing shallow as I started to move my hips slowly back and forth. I knew it wasn't coming off in the wrong order by now.</p> <p>Suddenly he stopped talking, looking at his watch and said, "That's too bad because we won't be ready to go out any time soon. I'm sorry if we ended up like this, or if I should have had more time. I was hoping to be invited to a birthday party. I'm so sorry it happened that way that you took the idea of going to a birthday party way too far. That will be very awkward for you on your part too, and I really feel you had no choice but to do it just so. That's all right. That's what making out with you was about, right? Let's just keep to ourselves and forget about that."</p> <p>I could not really talk as I felt the tension in his words, and he just nodded his acquiescence. He had taken a deep breath and was now looking directly at my eyes and saw how aroused I had become. I looked down at the large and engorged knob of his cockhead that I had felt on the inside of my thigh a few moments ago with my hand and that I could not tear away even with some effort. I was not even sure if he could see it or even imagine it anyway.</p> <p>It was one thing to look down at him watching me with a stiff cock and even quite another to be looking at him as he did it. Maybe he was just so pleased by the way it looked when we were together, but this was the first time I was seeing him in the moment and this way excited me so much I wanted to be that much more. His dick was growing even harder and even harder, as I rubbed the head slowly up and down over my mound in a slow and smooth manner. There is nothing like it... is that what you become? I think the moment's end is closer than anticipated. I could feel it slowly growing, pulsing and twitching in my hands as I slowly stroked him up and down.</p> <p>We didn't say or do anything for a few moments, just sat and watched. His hand had found my clitoris and was rubbing in slow circles, causing me to breathe very shallowly. I continued to look down at his penis, enjoying the view as my fingers rubbed and caressed it.</p> <p>"That feels so nice," I managed to gasp, as his other hand now strummed my pussy faster and faster. Our lips met only seconds apart, as the passion of his love making grew stronger and higher. We were both still kissing and caressing each other as, in a quiet and sensual matter, we both stopped breathing.</p> <p>"I can't help it," I said, as I sat up suddenly and said, "I've wantedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
