Her pussy lips were swollen and exposed, already exposed and waiting for him. The smell was intoxicating and his cock started hardening in his pants at the sight. He knew that there was something wrong with her, or maybe worse still, that she had a tiny, tight pussy.</p> <p>“Oh, I don’t have to do this,” she said, but he held up his hand, indicating her to stop.</p> <p>“Not yet then,” he said, and stood up, placing her body against his waist.</p> <p>“We don’t have to do this,” she said, although it seemed like it, even with her head held firmly against his chest and her arms around his neck, he found himself unable to say no.</p> <p>She looked up at him with her eyes like she always did to him when they did something so wicked.
