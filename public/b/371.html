Why are you hiding it?"</p> <p>"I'm your best friend," I said, sitting down on my bed. "What harm is it doing that?"</p> <p>I was relieved to see that most of the tension was gone. I got up and sat next to her; wrapping my arms around her and kissed her cheek. "Do you know who I am by now?" I asked her. "My best friend?"</p> <p>"Yes," she said softly. "Yes, my love."</p> <p>"I'm so glad you're here," I said, brushing her hair behind her ear, "and I'd like to go ahead with our plan, if only to be safe."</p> <p>"Ohh," she said, sounding surprised. "But we really have no time for this, right?"</p> <p>"If you're going to be a good girl, let me know," I smiled, pushing her away and getting a towel to wipe herself dry. "You don't have to hurry. There isn't anything I would mind if you kept it on until it goes back to normal."</p> <p>"You got me here, too, I can assure you."</p> <p>I sat down with her again. She looked tired but peaceful and I felt like I could keep going. I kept thinking of the things I had done with my hands yesterday, and how much more exciting it would be to do something like that every single day.</p> <p>"I'm sorry to interrupt you," I said, sitting next to her again.</p> <p>"Don't be," she replied. "I have something planned too. If...if you'll let me help you."</p> <p>"I've really never done this before," I said, staring at her, unsure of what to do.</p> <p>"Well, then let's do it," she agreed, reaching out for me.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>The party was about a block away, but we weren't in a hurry to run. There were a number of people who were already talking, and some of them were enjoying their drinks. I was feeling nervous while her hands moved over the front of my shirt, touching and caressing all over my upper chest.</p> <p>"You look lovely," she said with a smile when she finally let go of it, leaning back on a sofa near the kitchen to look over some plants. "They're lovely. Thank you."</p> <p>She then turned away and sat at the table with her back to me, a hand on her leg, rubbing softly from her knee up her thigh. I leaned forward a little and put my hand around her, and she leaned on my shoulder.</p> <p>"It's been so long since I've done this..." I started speaking softly to her, and she laughed a little. "It's been so long for me too, too," she said and closed her eyes.</p> <p>I was so nervous that I couldn't even stand it.</p> <p>"Let me do something for you," I said, feeling more nervous now, and she laughed, leaning forward a little more.</p> <p>I stood up and pulled her arm up toward me so that our bodies touched, and she pulled me against her, pressing our bodies closer together. I could feel the heat coming from her and I felt a familiar stirring in my crotch.</p> <p>She slowly brought her hand up my back, feeling and squeezing my ass through my jeans. I put my arm around her waist and she leaned against me, her tits pressing against my chest.</p> <p>"I'm cold," she said, softly. "Would you come on home with me?" she asked.</p> <p>I didn't know what to say or do, even after she'd asked me to come on home with her. "Sure, I'll go put something on."</p> <p>She laughed again gently. "Just take off my clothes."</p> <p>That made my heart jump. I sat down down on the sofa next to her and reached around to her back and unclasped her brassiere, and I gently pulled them down off her shoulders and off. I then gently pushed her back, so that she was sitting there with my cock pressing against her crotch. I leaned forward a little, sliding my hand down the front of her waist, and she let out a moan as my finger tips slid around the front of her belly button. I ran my hand down the front of her inner thigh, touching her pussy through the thin cotton of her panties, which I slowly slid down her thighs, until I reached the front of her panties.</p> <p>"Please, I can't take no more," she said. "Let me see what kind of pleasure this thing has given me." My fingers slipped under the elastic waistband of her panties and she lifted her butt up as I pulled them down, exposing her neatly trimmed pussy, which was covered by a thin strip that stopped just above the lips of her sex.</p> <p>She placed herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
