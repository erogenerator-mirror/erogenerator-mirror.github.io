I took this in stride, I suppose. It was such a beautiful smile. He held up his right hand and waved it to the next person, and everyone else got to their feet. There was a moment of tension in the room and everyone seemed to notice that there was no room in. They just stared at him and me as we made our way towards the doors.</p> <p>He took the opportunity to point the pistol at the back of my right wrist but I refused to take it. I had already been shot six times now, so there was nothing left of my hands to hide. I tried not to draw attention to myself as I made my way to the door. He reached out and stopped me. We stood in the doorway for a moment, both of us unsure what was expected of us next. He held out his hand and I let him help me up onto the couch.</p> <p>"Why don't you go change back?" He asked quietly.</p> <p>"I don't know, I think it's a little embarrassing." I said honestly.</p> <p>He gave me a look as if to say, "don't get any shit on me again." He grabbed my crotch which caused a little more of a groan to escape my lips, and pulled my lips apart slightly.</p> <p>"What the fuck is going on here? What's going on?" I snapped back to face him.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I should have been calling you a cab. I'm really, really sorry. Just so you know I have to go, I have no more pockets for you to be wearing in any fashion. I'm real sorry!"</p> <p>He reached out and grasped my throat with one hand. I felt his other hand slide down my stomach and up underneath my shirt. He reached down and unzipped my jeans. He slid his fingers under the fabric and pushed them down just a bit, making them loose enough to expose my entire lower body. He slowly pulled my shirt out from inside the fabric and threw it over the door.</p> <p>At his reaction I felt a moment of panic surge through my body at the prospect of losing him. I had to maintain a straight face for a moment, knowing that I would be forced to give up everything in my life if he did this again. I decided that I would just let this play along with the whole situation. I moved my hand from my throat to let my fingertips graze over his lips. He moaned and leaned towards me. I opened my mouth and slowly pressed it against his and our tongues began to dance. I let go of his lips and moved my right hand from my throat up to his cheek. As we got closer to the couch we broke our kiss, and I stood a little straighter so that he could see better of me.</p> <p>I looked at him over his shoulder. "You see this?" as I pointed with the barrel of my gun pointed down at him. He nodded his head yes. I pointed it further away from his face, so that we were looking at nothing.</p> <p>I then put my hands behind my back and pulled at my waistband. With my jeans on I was now standing in just my white lacy panties. I turned slightly to the right and pulled them down over my ass and to my knees so that I could kick them off my ankles. He saw the panties in my hand but I looked like I was trying to cover up. I moved towards him again and put my hands behind me. I looked around the room, and saw that everyone was watching my body for the cameras.</p> <p>I reached up to his jacket and unbuttoned the top button. I slowly removed his jacket and put it on the chair across from him just so that he could see better of me. I turned around and slowly wiggled my butt at him. My panties were still at my knees, but even with my feet in the air I turned around in one fluid motion so that he could see every inch of my ass cheeks as they disappeared under my black panties.</p> <p>We continued to be eye to eye. I could feel his excitement. I kept running my finger over his lips where he was standing at the door. After a moment, I reached down and ran my nails through his hair. He reached behind his neck then, and grabbed behind his head, which I pulled back. I bent low in front of him, giving him a good look of my underwear. I slowly pulled his shirt upward, up, and off, exposing his chest. I pulled the shirt off his shoulders, to the ground, and threw it on the chair. When I ran my hands back down my body, they found their way to my panties. I slipped my skirt down over my thighs and sat on the couch, leaving my underwear in place. I was now fully dressed. He smiled that wonderful smile again that he had.</p> <p>The sight ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
