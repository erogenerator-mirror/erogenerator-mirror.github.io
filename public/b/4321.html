After that we went back into our room to continue our day. It didn't take much for us to get cleaned up after our day of sex and I left a trail of cum on the carpet as I walked by the room. I thought to myself that if what I had been wanting a week was to be true, I should have been more discreet.</p> <p>It had only been two days, but I had no idea how I would handle the experience. Jack was my first and it was the first time I had ever been with another guy. The more I thought about what I had done when it happened, the more I wanted to do it again. I knew I wanted someone in my life, something to turn me on, to have me do what I had always done. I wasn't sure what that wanted me to do, but if I had my way I would do it.</p> <p>Chapter 4:</p> <p>As I climbed the stairs to my bedroom, I thought over my first encounter with Jack and was very glad I had the nerve to see him again. He was a pretty good guy and very attractive. I don't know why I never had a chance to see him before. I guess the idea of him being a man that I should have dated was starting to creep me out to. He was the first guy I had been with and I certainly had never been with another man before. It seemed so silly in retrospect.</p> <p>I had already gotten a few drinks in me, so with one of Jack's beers in my hand I slowly made my way to my bed. My thoughts again reined into me as I slowly removed my clothing, letting the loose ends hang freely. I was still very much in shock at what I had done, but I was determined to see Jack again. I was now completely naked before him and I saw that he was staring intently at my breasts through my clothes and I found myself feeling very aroused at the thought. I had been with a couple of guys before, but I had never been with another woman that was so young.</p> <p>I had seen one thing about men that I thought was sexy, but not with all those other young guys out there. There was certainly no need for all that money being spent on a girl. I knew that it was a waste not to try it myself so I gently turned my head back toward him. Jack didn't seem to react. He just stared at me for a few second before he spoke.</p> <p>"I'm sorry if I shocked you, it was just a question, I thought you were in shock. I didn't mean to upset you, I didn't mean anything. When I saw you, I didn't know what to do. It's so strange to be standing here naked, it's so much different than doing your job."</p> <p>I thought to myself, "He has a point, it's different than getting someone to show you what they really want to do is to do. After having sex with the woman I had a few times, well I did it again and again."</p> <p>I felt my body starting to relax, even if it still had a strange feel to it. I slowly got up onto the bed and got on my back. I spread my legs wide and Jack moved toward me. He started to kiss me on the mouth and I leaned my head back.</p> <p>"Well don't you be doing the foolish thing just yet, I just want to be with you for a little while longer. Just relax, I'm sure you feel much better after having a man inside you."</p> <p>I just lay there and looked over at him over my shoulder as I moved my hand over my stomach and slowly began to run circles on it. My hand moved down to my pussy and I felt the heat from it all through my fingers. When I had me at a good enough level, I leaned close to his ear and whispered, "I just want to lay here with you for a little longer, you don't have to make a mess of things. You can clean yourself up after we get done. Can you do that for me?'</p> <p>Jack just nodded his head and began to lick my ear, slowly making his way down to my neck. He placed his mouth just over the area where I was covered, not on my skin, but on my whole upper body, his warm breath making my flesh tingle. I was glad he had thought to cover my breasts. It just felt so nice to have someone else's tongue on my body.</p> <p>After kissing him, I rolled over so my body was facing him. I slowly began to rub my breasts against his now raging manhood. He started to lift his hips so I could get him inside me. When I had him seated in me, I could feel his shaft just touching my lips while I rubbed myself up andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
