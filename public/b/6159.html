Please forgive my daughter. She is my best friend."</p> <p>"Thank you. She was the one who saved me from myself." He took his lips and kissed her hand.</p> <p>"This is my girl, she is in pain."</p> <p>"I didn't mean to interrupt you, but she is so beautiful. She is alluring."</p> <p>"Oh, sweetheart." He kissed her on the cheek. "Come, come, and sit with me. It is time for tea."</p> <p>She smiled at him as he left, she wished it were the same, so that they could go somewhere that they could talk freely. She couldn't have imagined how much trouble they would face on the way to that bed that had been made especially for them to share.</p> <p>He led them up a flight of white marble stairs to a large mahogany throne. He pulled her down to sit on the edge, which she was surprised to feel almost squealing. He leaned away from her and sat back on one side of the throne. He looked down upon them, a smile on his face.</p> <p>"You are looking beautiful my child." His tone was calm. "Such a look for you, you are going to get lucky on tonight. I wish you a happy life."</p> <p>"I'm sorry my lord." She smiled. "You really are a great man I think you are an exceptional warrior." She couldn't tell if he meant he believed her or not.</p> <p>"You know what I wish we could spend tonight alone, besides the tea, I'll be able to show you how much a great warrior I am and you will be grateful for the chance, because the next few hours will make your day better."</p> <p>She just nodded. "I'll never forget last night. My heart was torn between my love for you and my lust for you. I lost everything so soon and didn't even think about it."</p> <p>"So, we are going to go to bed, before you fall." His voice was quiet and loving as he gently ran his fingers through her hair. He wanted to say more but it never came out.</p> <p>"You aren't alone." Her voice was as soft as her voice. "I told them I would watch over you and come by later." He smiled to himself as he leaned forward and kissed her cheek.</p> <p>She felt like a queen before a queen had an audienceâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
