They chatted as he held her and the words flowed like water from a wellspring.</p> <p>After the second glass of wine, he turned to her.</p> <p>"When I'm ready, when you are ready," he whispered, "I want you to come in to the tub and feel my penis against your cheek.</p> <p>"Don't worry about the wine, I think I can still hold off until we're through."</p> <p>She nodded, her hand holding the glass and her body. He slipped under the water and she could feel the warmth of him between her legs. He slipped his hand back around to kiss her and then slid out the other side in preparation.</p> <p>He started with her breasts. Her legs opened for him and he cupped each and took the nipples into his mouth. That first one was his. Then he kissed her mouth and she kissed him.</p> <p>"Oh," she said as he pushed her back slightly and pressed his cock against her.</p> <p>She had never had sex in this manner with a man before. He moved down and kissed her lower belly before she could wrap her legs around him.</p> <p>She gasped as his tongue began to probe her. He was very good. The tip of his tongue touched her flesh, tracing the slit of her vagina and then plunging in again.</p> <p>She felt him move away from her a little and she opened her arms and legs. This time he used a condom but he did not use them. He moved back again and she watched as he reached down and pressed his erection against her vagina, the wetness of his body on its tip.</p> <p>He began to press into her. She thought she would cry out, but it would come later. He did what she wanted; he started to ride her and her body was responding as one, her lips swollen and her mouth opened.</p> <p>He put the condom on and pushed his way in.</p> <p>"Oh yes, harder, I want you to move your hips."</p> <p>She pushed herself into him, feeling herself pushing in against his weight. His hands held her hips and lifted her up a little off the bed, her legs wrapped around him.</p> <p>As they moved their hips, she felt her body respond. When her body became aware of her body's needs, it was to his needs. It took every effort he had to hold out.</p> <p>He wanted more and when she felt him start to move again. His breathing became stronger and she could see the head of his cock disappearing into her. His body was warm and hard and she could feel this, too.</p> <p>She felt herself sliding on him and he had made her a little hotter, too.</p> <p>"Oh, you're so warm and hard."</p> <p>"Is that good for you?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes," she answered, "Oh, but I'm ready! I love you, now, and I want to be a lot of fun again."</p> <p>His voice brought her over the edge. "I love you, too. I'm too. I'm good! Oh, yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!"</p> <p>Her whole body seemed to be in a constant state of trembling and her muscles were tensing.</p> <p>She kept her arms and legs clenched, as he continued to move deeply and she felt his cum shoot into her as she held him firmly.</p> <p>"I know," she thought, "I'm feeling your cum, too. You're a lot of fun, too, you know."</p> <p>They just stayed in each other's arms for a long time, until a knock came in and they reluctantly separated. Neither of them spoke or asked questions.</p> <p>"Can I go to the bed?" she asked.</p> <p>"Of course, it was good of you to have someone else to talk toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
