She wanted to lay there for a minute but decided against it. She had to do something.</p> <p>"Mom?"</p> <p>"Yes sweetheart, why don't you start doing some of that homework for me?"</p> <p>"Um, right now?" Her mother grinned.</p> <p>"Just a minute." She stepped over to her computer, pulled back her knees and slid along so her butt came to rest against the bed. She looked up at her mom.</p> <p>"Go ahead, but we're not doing much more than that. I'm just going to let you pick the computer."</p> <p>She smiled at her little mom. She loved how it made her feel, that she could be just a little different when she wanted. She leaned forward, her lips sliding off her father's.</p> <p>"Thank you, mom."</p> <p>"Good girl. You know how much I love it when you call me mommy?"</p> <p>She heard a laugh and looked up.</p> <p>"I've got a special little outfit to wear for you."</p> <p>"I haven't even started with it yet. Why don't you pick what's appropriate?"</p> <p>Her dad said good bye. She felt it in her tummy. It told her how she would be feeling during supper, but she didn't know what to expect. She opened the drawer and found the outfit she wanted. It was a mini-dress that came down just below her ass cheeks. She pulled it on, noting how it hugged her hips and her back. It was sleeveless and so was the front. It was low-cut and she knew her breasts were pushing against it as she stood before her father's bed. She smiled at him as she slipped her panties up. She took the dress and stepped into it. The back was a halter which reached almost to her waist. The shoulder straps fell across her shoulders and were pulled tight on her breasts. The neckline was wide and almost plunged right to her navel. The halter was a sheer, pink mesh. With her long red hair and green eyes, it made her look a million bucks. Her breasts weren't huge, but they were perky and just big enough to make her cleavage look amazing against her skin. She pulled it onto her head and put her top back on. She pulled her hair up one way and the other the other. She thought she would have to look for the mirror. She had to be wearing her glasses.</p> <p>Her father said good bye and walked over to his bedroom. She opened the door and walked slowly into her father's room. There was a mirror and she saw that her glasses were out from beneath her hair. She quickly pulled her hair back from her face and turned on the lights. The room was dark and she was sure that her father was just sitting on the side of the bed talking to someone. She felt her heart skip a beat.</p> <p>"What is going on there?" She said softly, walking to the bed. Her heart was beating fast. There it was again. This time, it felt normal. It felt almost innocent. It felt like she was being watched. She saw who it was. She walked over, grabbed the bedside table and knelt beside his chair. She began rubbing the mirror against her face. She saw herself just sitting there looking like a complete idiot. She quickly closed her eyes and leaned closer. She could have stood there forever. Nothing mattered if he were watching her.</p> <p>The mirror was all her mother. No other person in the house could be touching her face. Even her father, she knew. She didn't even see him. He sat there staring at her. Every move she made made him just stand there like an audience.</p> <p>She saw his hand on his lap. His middle finger was just brushing the top of his cock.</p> <p>"I...can't..." She was almost ready to beg him to stop but her mind kept telling her it was for him. He had to know or he would stop. She wanted him to give her the chance to stop it would be for the best. She closed her eyes and leaned back against the mirror. She wanted to feel his fingers moving on the inside of her thighs where there were soft lips touching her exposed skin. She wanted to feel that soft lips, that wet tongue. She knew she didn't want to stop it.</p> <p>"It feels like you're about to cum again." Her father said and she immediately felt his hand move away. It was a slow, deliberate movement but she couldn't stop herself. He was right on the brink. Her cheeks were pouty and she was breathing heavy. Her head fell back against the mirror. Her eyes fluttered and she closed them again. She felt her father's fingers begin to pull at her panties.</p> <p>"Oh god..." She whimpered.</p> <p>Aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
