I'm not sure what to expect."</p> <p>I was beginning to worry. She had to have some wild behavior to go with this. I just had that worried look on my face and I guess I was still scared. Her kiss became more intense and passionate and I was beginning to really wonder if she was just going to kiss me again.</p> <p>Allie didn't move for a while and her eyes seemed to be looking around the room more and less. When she finally looked at me again I was about ready to go over to her and hold her hands. I leaned forward a little and planted a kiss on each of her lips. "It's ok, Ashlyn. If anything happens I'll take care of it. Please take care of me?"</p> <p>Allie just shook her head no and smiled.</p> <p>"Ok. This is going to sound nuts, but I'm glad you took this initiative."</p> <p>Allie's face was still a little red, but she got off the bench and knelt down by the edge of the desk in one of the little cubbyholes in the side. As she looked up at me she was wearing a smile on her face and started stroking my neck with gentle fingertips. One of her hands was rubbing my chin, the other was gently rubbing my chest. Allie was softly moaning, I think in approval of what she felt right then.</p> <p>"I love you so much." I breathed softly into her ear. At that moment my dick actually jerked a little bit and Allie took it into her mouth. Her warm wet mouth felt amazing on my prick and the sensations it was sending throughout my body. I was slowly running out of control. Allie's eyes were closed and I could see her lips were slightly parted. I could feel how hard her nipples were, the tips of her breasts were poking firmly through the thin fabric of her dress. My eyes followed her hands to the skirt of her dress and they were running through the soft hairs on her mound. She began to move her hips back and forth slightly, her hand was just working on the top half of my shaft.</p> <p>Allie took a long, shuddering breath, "God, that feels good."</p> <p>"It's all yours," I whispered. I had to stop her hands and put them over my head so I was laying on the desk. I was almost paralyzed by the moment and I didn't know how to handle things again. She slowly rose off my body, taking me by the shoulders and gently dragging me to the bed. The next thing I knew Allie started on her skirt and was soon sliding it slowly off her body. She had her legs spread wide apart and her hand was slowly rubbing the length of her pussy. The sight and soft smell of her brought my dick back to immediate attention. I was not about to complain.</p> <p>Allie lifted up the front section of her dress and exposed the front of her pussy. She just let it drop free of her body, revealing her pussy, hairless, and so warm I could feel it through the thin cloth of her panties. There she was, spread wide open, eyes closed, eyes looking at me.</p> <p>"It's so fucking beautiful," I said softly.</p> <p>Allie turned around slowly and raised her dress all the way to her waist. She looked so amazing. As her legs came up from the floor, I could see her pussy hair and the pinkness of her labia. Allie leaned down over me and rested her arms on the desk. She pushed her hair back from her face and turned to stare intently at me. Her eyes were half closed as her hand was still pumping on her pussy. I had my hand on my own cock and seemed to have no control at all. "I've never done this before, Ashlyn," she said softly.</p> <p>"Me neither. I've probably tried everything, but I never had one of those, you know."</p> <p>"Neither has mine," she said between kisses. "But I bet you will."</p> <p>She looked at me for a moment, like she was contemplating something. Finally she lifted her dress to her waist and slid her hand down her body, rubbing the inside of her thighs just a little.</p> <p>Her breath was coming in so fast it sounded like she was getting ready to come.</p> <p>"You are so much better at this than I am at anything." I was getting close.</p> <p>"It's a good cock," Allie said with a sexy grin. She was smiling so much it was kind of comical and, I know, a bit funny. I guess she liked my reaction and didn't want to ruin the mood by mentioning it.</p> <p>She continued rubbing and I was about to unload when Allie raisedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
