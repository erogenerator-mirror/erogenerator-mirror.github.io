Nice to meet you too, Jack. We'll be right out."</p> <p>*</p> <p>Jack leaned back in his chair as his father cleared a small cup of coffee for him.</p> <p>"Are you all right dad?" Jack asked, standing up to help him with his feet.</p> <p>"Better now, Jack. How'd you...? We went out for breakfast. I'm thinking you were...?"</p> <p>"Just about to say I'm gonna go for a jog, Jack." He answered as he pushed his hair back, "You two enjoy your day."</p> <p>As he walked the half mile back to the farm he had to get ready again, but this time it was worth it, because his son was about the biggest cock I'd ever met before!</p> <p>*</p> <p>As Jack drove up from the farm he realized he still hadn't put on his socks. He was about to sit down when he saw his father leaning his way through the woods.</p> <p>"Are you...? Are you..."</p> <p>"Are you ready for the run yet dad?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess." He responded as he began the long walk to his apartment, "And if you decide to do some more run in the woods...</p> <p>*</p> <p>"Are you sure you're all right, Mom?"</p> <p>Lana stepped back as she heard her father enter the house and began to walk outside. He was so cute!</p> <p>Lana could feel the excitement about today. She had just seen him with another girl. She couldn't help but think about how hot he had been for her! She was still feeling jealous at the thought that he was now fucking her mother. But Jack sure hadn't complained about her...</p> <p>So there she was! She finally decided to get his reaction out of him first. So she walked in front of him and then sat down, "Jack, I'm ready if you are." she began, getting into the running stance she found so good last time. "Come on... we have time before my folks get back."</p> <p>As he took off his shoes and socks, he began to feel a sense of loss. He would have to admit, what a great body she had!</p> <p>"Let's go ahead and leave them there for a bit..." she said, as she got up on her feet and began to run. "Can we hurry up with those pants?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess you're up for it." He answered as they continued their run.</p> <p>*</p> <p>As they ran through the forest, Jack pulled his shirt off. Lana helped him with the rest of his clothes as he ran in the nude.</p> <p>"I guess we gotta do that again, huh?" she teased, "It feels kind of odd wearing only my pants, but I like it!"</p> <p>"Well, you better get changed, Dad." Jack answered, "Remember I'm still your dad."</p> <p>"Yeah, but we can come back and see you again sometime." She smiled, "I'm sure your wondering what all the big guys at the college are doing, and I won't tell you!" she said as she began to laugh.</p> <p>"No, you're not going to tell me about you and mom, are you?" Jack shot back, "Nope!"</p> <p>"Come on. I was just kidding! You'd have to tell... "</p> <p>"Well, I'm gonna keep that to myself, as it's only a memory!" he said, turning to walk away.</p> <p>As he turned around, Jack suddenly stopped and stared at his son. "What's wrong with you?" he asked.</p> <p>"Nothing's wrong. What you and mom did... It's not like we didn't do anything, but... It's just..." he said, looking him up and down.</p> <p>"Jack? What's wrong?" Lana asked, stopping his tracks.</p> <p>"Nothing's wrong. I just..."</p> <p>"...I thought you and mom were..."</p> <p>"...Oh?"</p> <p>"I thought you and mom made love every morning, but nothing ever happened...."</p> <p>Lana couldn't believe what she was hearing. "I don't think that's it, Dad. We're not like your mother or your father. I really think we were just about perfect for each other! And, like you said before, we make love every day! How does that change things?"</p> <p>"Sure, Dad! It'll be okay by me now. Why don't you get your running shoes off a bit?
