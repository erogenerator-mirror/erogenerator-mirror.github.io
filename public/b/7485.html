I really do. This is my second time." I said.</p> <p>"No, I like hearing it."</p> <p>"So, when is the next time?"</p> <p>"It doesn't matter now. I have already been thinking about how I would like you, and how I wanted you to feel. And last night."</p> <p>"Last night what?" I asked.</p> <p>Just then she had the phone in her hand and was about to push me back into the couch.</p> <p>"No...stop." I said.</p> <p>She stopped. Then she looked at the caller and said, "It is for you. I want you to say it now."</p> <p>I couldn't help but respond, "I want to hear."</p> <p>"Yes, I do," she said as she pressed the "call" button.</p> <p>"This is your house."</p> <p>"Yes." I said, still feeling a little uncomfortable.</p> <p>"This is my house." She said.</p> <p>"But this is my apartment. I can't...I will just..." I finished.</p> <p>"That is the deal. You agree."</p> <p>"I don't know. I'll have to think about that." I said.</p> <p>"I know," she said. "but I think you will like it better for the both of us to do it in there, no matter how long it takes."</p> <p>"I will tell you. I understand. I really do."</p> <p>"See you in a few hours."</p> <p>"Yeah, bye."</p> <p>"Bye."</p> <p>She got up and kissed me good-bye.</p> <p>"I've been waiting for your call. I want to say goodbye so I can sleep in your bed tonight. And then, have you come up with anything and let me know as soon as you can."</p> <p>She put the phone down and turned the vibrator off. Then she looked at it again and said, "I think you'll enjoy this. You got a good idea, didn't you? I was just getting a second dose of good girl. I bet you came so close to cumming, didn't you?"</p> <p>"I haven't really come close to cumming either. I'm only really horny this afternoon."</p> <p>She smiled at me and put the vibrator away and went back to the kitchen. I heard her go back through the house. I heard her washing the dishes. I sat there watching her get out of the shower. I was getting hard just watching her. She was not just walking up and down the hall to let herself in. She was dressing and making sure the door was closed. She was so good to me, was so very good. I almost told her to be good but then thought that would be too embarrassing.</p> <p>"So, are you going to stay and fuck me tonight or not."</p> <p>"What?" I asked.</p> <p>"No reason to lie. Are you going to stay here and fuck me. Are you going to let my pussy cum, or do you want to use a dildo, or anything like that?"</p> <p>"Well, I don't really know the answer to that. I told you what I would. You are the only one I want to do this to." She said. "Let me finish washing up."</p> <p>I turned the vibrator off and went into the bathroom to get my shaving soap. While I was in there, I took a moment to reflect, trying to decide what would make me do it. I wasn't sure how to go about it. And how to tell her the next time we met. I didn't know what it would be like or if it would ever end. And what if she was the one that would ask me why I was there if she needed me to shave her.</p> <p>Then I finished washing and put the soap in the tub and jumped in. I had been thinking about this for a while and was so horny I was just about ready to cum. Once I did my thing, I turned the vibrations off and began to dry my hair. I could hear the phone ringing again. I picked it up.</p> <p>"Hello."</p> <p>"Hey, where the sh--, ooo. So, if you want to be my roommate, then you know what to do. I bet you will enjoy it."</p> <p>"Do you still get a dick?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'll give you that later. Now, let's get out of this shower and start this evening." she said.</p> <p>She had just walked out of the bathroom and when she walked into the bedroom, I was already half-hard. She looked even hotter walking down the hall to the bedroom. God, she was so pretty, just standing there and not quite moving. Her hair was still dripping wet. She looked so damned sexyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
