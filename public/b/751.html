"Go sit in my office while I think it through. Okay?" She nodded her thanks before heading off to the restroom. After a few minutes, it finally dawned on her.</p> <p>"So what did he say to you?...</p> <p>That's what I was going to say when I came in. I'm sorry, I told you it was all right. I love you, and I want you to be mine. It's all I can say. Yes, I do love you, but there's something else inside of me. So tell me..."</p> <p>She paused a moment to catch her breath and then reached up to softly stroke her hair. It felt comforting to her in a strange way. I know it might have been because he was telling me the same thing as before, if not, and if he felt the same way I did, but I want to tell him the same things. Can we still be friends? Can we be lovers? If he feels the same way about me as I feel towards him, it would be his opinion, not mine. It's obvious he feels the same thing himself.</p> <p>"We just have to wait for a couple months, but that's all right, if that's what you really want. There is another part to this relationship I told you about, I don't know for a while but I think I can safely say yes if not for some other reason. Let's keep it on that date of course."</p> <p>"That's okay, honey. No, it's perfectly okay," she said, squeezing her fist around his dick.</p> <p>When he stepped away from her once the water was turned down, she took a deep breath and said:</p> <p>"Okay, I agree."</p> <p>He took a step backwards and she continued to stroke until he was at the doorway and she let her hand drop to his lap.</p> <p>"You go," she said quietly, then stood up, picked up the dishes and led the way to her room quietly.</p> <p>She undressed for bed, and when she closed the door, she turned off the light and then climbed under the covers. They lay together for a few minutes just staring at the stars through the open door, then finally drifted off to sleep.</p> <p>When Sarah woke the next morning, she was alone and as if on cue, the door flew open to announce she was awake. She sat up and quickly got up to get her robe on, and then realized to put her clothes on again while she was doing this. She put on one of her better pairs of panties and then pulled on shorts and a t-shirt. She was a mess, still in bed, with tears stinging her eyes. After a few moments she picked up the coffee cup and looked down to see her bra and panties lying where they had been a half an hour ago. She picked it up, and realized she was sitting with her legs open, and was still wearing her shorts and t-shirt.</p> <p>"Sarah, you're home! I've been calling you, but you've just left me at work and you just called me to come see you at work. I'm sorry but I have to run out of bed and go get you. There's no need for you to be alone tonight, I'm sure."</p> <p>She stopped herself from continuing to put on her bra and then pulled her shirt on. As she pulled on her panties, however, she wondered what she had said.</p> <p>"I think I left you at one of the big houses and didn't pick up on your number," he said. "I think I just asked, you know, if I could watch you while you got in and out of those panties."</p> <p>She quickly realized she should have been concerned, so she let the lie play out on her mind.</p> <p>"What the heck? He asked to see a doctor? No, that's out of bounds. He's your husband!"</p> <p>"Well, um - sorry," she said, trying to make herself sound unafraid.</p> <p>"No, it's okay, it's not."</p> <p>"But..."</p> <p>"It isn't. And really, it's not going to," he said as he gently pushed back her hair down. "You are my wife. I think what we should do is just wait for you to be back, that's all it is. I'll see you tomorrow, if I can walk out of your office this morning and to work with you."</p> <p>She let the thought linger for a moment, but it passed and she couldn't help feeling the need to close her eyes.</p> <p>"Alright," she said as she stood back up. "I can't keep trying to get away if you don't want to."</p> <p>After she got up to put on her panties, she went to the bathroom and washed her face and hair.
