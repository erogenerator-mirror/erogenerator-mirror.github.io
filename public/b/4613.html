"So what do you say we just go and have a quickie while you keep an eye on the clock?" I asked.</p> <p>"Sure, what time do you want to get in my bed?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don't care, do I?"</p> <p>"Oh it would be my pleasure," she said with a grin. "But the answer is 'no' I guess."</p> <p>At that point, I had the choice between her and the door; the hallway or her bedroom. My first decision had to be to go through the door like I was naked and in her bed. This time I chose to go through the hallway where the door was.</p> <p>As I stood outside her bedroom door, I noticed the bed with the black sheets, which, to my surprise, were already filled from her night before. I was standing there at the door for probably ten or fifteen seconds then I opened the door.</p> <p>She wasn't wearing a nightgown, which surprised me because she was just a girl. I was in my boxers and T-shirt and she was, in an incredibly sexy baby doll nightie. I stood there waiting for her to open her door or she was going to take a cold shower.</p> <p>She finally did. "Nice view from that angle," I said as a matter of course. She just smiled and shook her head in a shrug. "How many movies do you have, Jeff?" it was difficult not to grin as she asked.</p> <p>"Six," I replied noncommittally. "Is there any of the movies you'd like to watch?" I asked.</p> <p>She smiled. "Well I just like to see what kind of movie that is," she shrugged. She turned to me and raised her nightie up to reveal her beautiful tits with their lovely, pink areola and my hardon.</p> <p>"Wow, how did I know you liked my tits?" she asked with a chuckle.</p> <p>"Well, yeah you just look better," I replied. "Is the nightie getting wet? My cock is getting so hard."</p> <p>"I don't know about wetness. But yes it certainly gets wet." She turned a slow 360 to look me in the eyes. "I can feel you getting hard," she grinned.</p> <p>"How does it get so hard? It's getting harder and harder," I teased, leaning on the door frame.</p> <p>"You don't get any, Jeff!" she laughed and threw her head back. "I don't usually get wet, but tonight that is more than you can say. I am always on the edge and there are times when someone just can't hold it in."</p> <p>"Honey, don't forget me," I said. "But if they get wet they'll get even hornier."</p> <p>"You won't get wet again when I have you so I won't," she retorted.</p> <p>She turned and started back down the hall to the bedroom with me half-stopping and just looking at me. When she had her way, I took a couple steps toward her. She was in the shower and I had a perfect view to see her tits swaying back and forth. The nightgown was thin enough that it didn't get in the way of my hardon. She turned toward me, putting her hands on the corner of her bed to balance herself as she smiled the other way and her body was magnificent in this light.</p> <p>"That's just amazing!" I said as I stepped closer. She leaned over to kiss me and I could feel her nipples pressing into my chest as they brushed against me with each step. I started to pull the sheet around her to cover me as she stopped herself, stepped into her bed again and slid under it. She gave me a quick kiss on the lips and then took my hand and led me to the middle of the bed. Before I knew what was happening she'd dropped my T-shirt to reveal me wearing just the boxers and I started running my hands up and down her body, from her neck down to her tits, down from her torso, then up again, until I felt the lightest touch with the tip of my aching cock.</p> <p>She spread her legs for me and I went to my knees on the bed on top of her. She wrapped her legs around my head and held me to her pussy as I slid my face directly into her pussy and my lips closed around her. I slid slowly down to her belly and slid my tongue from clit-to-pussy as she kept her legs in place. As the tip of my tongue ran slowly from her clit to her opening and back to her clit, she held my head tight against her pussy.</p> <p>Her clit was getting harderâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
