"I'm glad you're here." We hugged tightly. "I can't wait to be out of this hotel and back to my family," she said over and over as we squeezed each other to get into our own beds.</p> <p>"Just stay with me while you're at work tomorrow," I told her. "That's when we'll decide if it's OK to go on vacation and return."</p> <p>While we sat talking, her hand reached for the clasp of my robe. Her hand moved to cup my right breast as her other hand continued exploring my body. She gently kissed me as she continued feeling me up and fondling me. My breathing began to become a little rapid as my body's need grew. My pussy started to tingle as it tingled with anticipation and anticipation of what we had planned for tomorrow. As she fondled my flesh my nipple started to harden as her hand caressed and squeezed it. I knew that I had to have her right there on the spot if she didn't want to stop. With the knowledge I had of the others she would never ask me to do something she wouldn't willingly do, I made the decision a short time ago.</p> <p>"What are you thinking?" she asked. "Are you thinking that I don't want to do something I wouldn't enjoy, or that you don't want to enjoy it?" I asked knowing that she wanted no part of that. I looked at her and slowly shook my head up and down as if it would show that I hadn't thought to ask.</p> <p>"I'm thinking," I replied with a shrug. "Maybe this is the way it's going to be. You won't be mad and I won't feel wrong about our relationship and what's happened."</p> <p>A thought came to my thoughts. "Do you think there's a possibility to make this even more special for me? Will you want to get it over with, maybe even love me a little more?" And with that little thought I thought to myself that this was the best decision I had ever made. I looked away but my eyes said it all. I looked into the darkness of the blinds again, saw the darkness behind my eyes but it didn't stay there too long. I watched the world in front of me as she moved her body on top of mine. I heard our gentle kissing now only a soft whisper of our tongues as she felt my passion growing. I felt her soft breasts pressing against mine. The sensation as her nipples rubbed their way directly against mine was wonderful. I could smell the scent of her aftershave and couldn't imagine what else she may scent after her clothes slipped off. I opened my eyes a little more and saw she hadn't moved at all. Her eyes were closed as she continued kissing me. We kissed for quite a few minutes.</p> <p>"Your lips feel so nice," she said softly. "My lips feel wonderful too," she smiled. "And that's how I remember them as well," she said in a throaty voice.</p> <p>The feeling between her legs increased as I felt her body responding to my thoughts.</p> <p>"Will you want to do what I think you're thinking about?" she whispered. I looked back into the darkness, watched her mouth slowly move from side to side as she breathed faster. I looked back to see my eyes watching as her hands slowly moved to the waistband of her shorts and with a few quick motions began to pull them down. I watched as she lowered her shorts and her underwear over her knees, and as she spread them she was bare between the sheets. She took my hand and placed it on her pubic mound just below her navel. My hand moved to her pussy through the folds of the folds of her pussy skin and moved down to her opening. Feeling her sex with my fingers was just what I needed. I felt her vagina pulsate as I moved across the entrance to her tunnel. I moved in small circles over her opening as she sighed with anticipated pleasure with each touch. I moved my finger to press inside and felt her vagina open slightly. I could feel the outer lips against the inner ones and her pussy was wetter than I had felt it.</p> <p>I stopped with my finger inside her and moved my fingers up to rub her clit.</p> <p>"No," she whispered. "Don't stop." I moved my fingers in the same motion as before and could feel her body begin to relax a little.</p> <p>"Oh, wow," I heard from her as her face showed how much she missed our lovemaking. "Oh, wow," she repeated but with a louder and more sexual tone. I knew I shouldn't have continued but I felt her legs begin to buckle so I pulled my hands away.</p> <p>"No, no," she gasped. â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
