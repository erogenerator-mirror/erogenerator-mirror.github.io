She felt a leather ball cuff being clamped under her head and her legs were fastened together also behind an iron cross-bar.</p> <p>She felt the cool leather rubbing against her skin as it caressed her buttocks and she gasped as he tugged the ring at the front of her neck making it tighter than before. A leather collar and lead was then fastened around her head and the length of the chain pulled her arms behind her in front of her.</p> <p>She felt the cold softness of metal against her skin as he fastened the lead. She had no concept of time and seemed to have no idea how far she had to be from shore.</p> <p>She felt a sudden touch on her shoulder and shivered as his fingers ran along the side of her face. He began to lead her down the beach. She felt his hard body behind her as he led her back up the beach.</p> <p>She heard his footsteps on rocks and as she began to walk, she felt something brush against her bottom. She was carried away and there was no mistaking who it was.</p> <p>The young girl with the leash was the one who brought her down the slope onto the beach. The young girl led her by her collar and began to lower the leather collar. She was wearing a simple white bikini, leaving no doubt about what she was. She was small breasted and appeared to be wearing the white bikini all the time she worked.</p> <p>There was now no mistaking who the young man was as she was led back down the beach. She started to walk the way from the beach towards the village of Sand. The young girl led her by her collar as the young girl led her down the beach.</p> <p>Sand was far away, somewhere on the other end of the island. A very thin layer of sand covered several miles of the island just as the young girls collar was. There were waves breaking above the island which were high and low and the sound of splashing could be heard. Her shoes were not on, though her feet were still a hundred yards below her.</p> <p>There was an old log on top of the sand, some fifty yards across and covered with sand.</p> <p>There was not a stitch on her shirt other than the leather collar. She was naked from the neck down and the feeling of the leather against her skin and skin was exciting.</p> <p>There were other young and older people walking about the beach but all of them seemed to be dressed like her.</p> <p>Sand turned and was walking backwards towards the group of people lying under the large camp fire. There was a young lady who was also naked from the neck up, her shirt was untied and tied in front of her waist at the front with a single rope looped through the metal clip on the back. Sand's shirt was pulled tight about her body and they were all dressed like hers.</p> <p>There were four men and two women, and they were leaning over and kissing as the older couple stood in front of them staring at the naked girl.</p> <p>There was a long drawn out groan from the mouths and they slowly lowered their heads down on to the girl, kissing and licking her.</p> <p>Sander turned and saw the man and woman kiss passionately on the lips and lips and Sand thought that it was an odd sight in comparison to what he was seeing. He had no problem of being part of it anyway.</p> <p>It had always been a fantasy of his to kiss other men, to have a man kneeling while another man looked on and watched.</p> <p>He felt his loins swell again when he realised that she was looking at him. He felt his legs move a little wider as he watched her.</p> <p>There was a woman next to him who looked a little younger than her partner who looked about twenty. When they looked up again a young man stood next to Sand and he was leaning against the wall of the camp. He saw Sandy's friend and the man in the camp and realised that they were looking at her with interest.</p> <p>He felt his loins jerk and almost felt as if he would orgasm under the intense feelings from his loins.</p> <p>After a moments pause on looking at Sandy it was clear that they had done something else. The young man in the camp was breathing hard and Sand could hear gasps from the young women.</p> <p>The man looked into Sand's eyes and saw a man in the man's arms who was also naked and was just looking at her. Sand wondered if in the world they had gone away from the village and if they could get away from what was going on.</p> <p>He felt it was wrong as he was kissing the boy between the woman's legs while watching his friend. He also felt that his loins must be aching.
