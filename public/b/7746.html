You know exactly what I want."</p> <p>"Please come."</p> <p>Neral moved from the bed and went to the door into the hallway.</p> <p>"Where are we going?"</p> <p>"Here."</p> <p>Neral closed the door and locked it and went to the bathroom.</p> <p>"You better be careful," she warned him, "If it gets you in danger...then you should get yourself checked up."</p> <p>After a long shower, Neral took off her clothes, got in bed and waited, and waited.</p> <p>The sun was in their face. Neral thought about her time with Leliana, and wondered where she was now. She turned off her lamp and closed her eyes, remembering the day Leliana had told her about taking a walk on the wilder side of the river, and the way Leliana had soothed her in thanks.</p> <p>She could smell herself, and she remembered being in her father's arms. And then when they were on the walk and she felt like she was a kid again, after the time with him, Neral remembered feeling safe and safe on the side of Leliana. They were together now.</p> <p>She lay on her back next to their clothes, and she put her finger to her lips.</p> <p>"Come on," Neral said, "let's get something to eat, something fast."</p> <p>While Leliana and her mother slept in the next room, she found a small table set up and set it on the other side of the room. Neral watched as her mother slept and ate, her father talking and walking back and forth on his way towards the village and his friend. She sighed happily to herself, happy that she could feel herself doing things for a friend, that someone like her cared enough about her.</p> <p>She put on her clothes and went to her room.</p> <p>She had gone through her mother's dresses and skirts without trying them on, and she still had a nice white lace kimono and a pair of white silk stockings, and a yellow shirt. That would keep most of her clothes dry.</p> <p>After Neral got dressed and brushed her teeth, she sat at the table and turned on the computer to see if there was anything she had left to read.</p> <p>She put her laptop into the cupboard below the stove before opening her browser and searching the history for the day.</p> <p>She had only seen her mother a few times before in her life. She remembered them kissing and making love many times...but there were times when she had never even considered the incest taboo and never even seen her own mother kissing or being made love to by another woman.</p> <p>She took her time and went to her room, trying to find something to read, but all she ended up doing was browsing the website and waiting for "Leliana" to come to the window of the computer.</p> <p>On her laptop, there was a page that opened to shows a picture of her mother kissing and making love to her.</p> <p>Then she clicked to the picture, and there she was lying on her back on the bed, kissing her mothers thighs on the right, and on the left. Then her mothers legs were off the bed, they were just hanging out a bit from the bed sheet, and her mothers hands were cupping her breasts through the material of the top of the top of the kimono.</p> <p>Neral stared, and there was a man on another computer, with his wife, and they were just looking at each other, smiling. She felt self-conscious that her daughter could be watching her masturbate, but Neral didn't care. On her laptop, there was an email from someone who called himself "Neral's sister" for a message that had come from a friend of one of her mother's friends, and on a website that had "liked to look" at her.</p> <p>The message was dated the night "Leliana's Secret", and Neral had read it, but didn't know who it was from. It had "Ladies, I'm looking for a woman, who is a bit young in the sex department, but the husband can't be bothered, can he, a friend?"</p> <p>Neral had never been very good at reading people's profiles, but she'd always assumed their age and that they'd be young, probably in their mid twenties, and they'd tell each other all their stories and stuff, and she'd never been surprised by that.</p> <p>It did surprise her, but she knew it was probably just her lack of experience that kept her from figuring it out.</p> <p>Neral's mind wandered as she remembered the day Lelâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
