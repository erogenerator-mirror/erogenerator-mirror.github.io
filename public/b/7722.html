You seem to have taken over; you're just so different!"</p> <p>"Like what?" she asked back. "You know, I was always the 'little girl in the big head' and here you are with a beautiful girl like me!"</p> <p>I laughed but was surprised at her honesty, she had never even suspected I was bisexual. She seemed to think I was gay although it was hard to tell whether she even knew this and I had no idea she had even known I was bi or gay.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want to do something like that?" I asked.</p> <p>"Oh my god no... I'm not... I'm not sure I can even go out to the market," she said, not sounding as reassured as I was. All I wanted to do right then was see the rest of her but she looked as nervous as I felt about it.</p> <p>"Oh don't worry honey, if it's okay with you, I won't tell anyone, its not something I'd do if I were you, I promise," I reassured her.</p> <p>We spent the rest of the morning shopping, shopping for just the right outfit to go with it and shopping for the day. She spent the rest of it just as she normally would, but she had the outfit shopping to contend with in her mind and it was hard for me to be sure it was what she really wanted. Maybe if we made the effort...</p> <p>Just after five there was a knock at the door and a middle aged woman said my name as she answered the door and said that this was my niece and that I would ring her ring box at the front door and let her into the house. She smiled broadly and said that she really needed to get out for a few minutes and that just before she ran to her room she would like to hear my voice telling her I was there on business and then leaving and getting home.</p> <p>I thanked her and took my niece into the house, she showed me down the corridor to the back door and waited until I'd gone through.</p> <p>"What's going on?" she asked when I'd gone through the door and she turned around and then gave me that gorgeous smile again and said, "How did you know that I'm still a virgin?"</p> <p>I laughed and said, "You'd know just by looking at me," and gave her a light smack on the ass and said, "You were in bed with my first cousin and the second cousin is my niece!"</p> <p>She just smiled and went back to the bedroom, I felt my niece had finally lost the battle and had been completely transformed into a beautiful woman on her first big date.</p> <p>I rang her doorbell and she came out in a long black satin dressing gown, the same gown I'd given her on the day of our wedding but this time it had a deep slit that showed off my niece's lovely legs and a pair of shiny black five inch stiletto heeled shoes. My niece was dressed in a pink baby doll robe and she looked so different than yesterday, I just couldn't stop myself staring at her as she came over to me and sat down on my lap.</p> <p>"It's a bit forward coming into the house today isn't it, seeing my niece in it with me wearing a gown," she teased and hugged me.</p> <p>"Of course it's about my Aunt Claire!" I exclaimed, she just smiled and kissed my cheek and said, "I don't know if I have ever been on a date and it looked so good to see you again too, wouldn't you like to see that again?"</p> <p>"Oh how sweet of you I would love to!" I said squeezing her ass and she just laughed and hugged me back.</p> <p>We went back to her room and were both naked, she'd showered and I'd thrown on a clean pair of boxers and that was it.</p> <p>After we'd laid there in each other's arms, just talking about the day's events I reached over and began to rub her hard nipples through the thin material of her robes. She leaned over and placed her ear against my chest and began to rub herself against me when she pulled her robe aside and she began to rub herself down against me and when I moved my hand down to caress her mound, she just moaned and took my hand away.</p> <p>"I'm sorry honey, I'll take that as a good excuse. I just want to tell you something and you have to trust me I can tell."</p> <p>I could already feel the warmth coming off her body and she was pressing herself against me and I lifted her face to meet mine and she slowly kissed me. I could feel a sparkle in her eyes and I just sat there thinking. I was afraid she would move the dress away and then just sit thereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
