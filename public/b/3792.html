I moaned and shivered and the sensations overtook me. We rolled over to a side and we lay there. I was on my side facing her and she was facing me. Still a bit breathless she put her hand on my arm and smiled.</p> <p>"That was incredible," she said. It was one of the most erotic things I had ever heard.</p> <p>"I could feel it. Every pulse. It seemed like a spark of electricity. I can't describe the excitement. I feel it now."</p> <p>"What happens in those moments?" she asked with a giggle.</p> <p>"After a few seconds it was like a million fingers exploring every nerve."</p> <p>She giggled and lay back. I climbed up onto the bed and sat on the end between her legs. I ran my thumb across her pussy and felt it flutter and jump. I felt her legs tremble some more and she lifted them to give me better access.</p> <p>"I'm afraid," she began. Looking deeply into my eyes she said. "I've never felt such excitement and joy." She pushed up at my shoulders and brought me back down to her pussy.</p> <p>"I've never felt anything as wonderful as that," she said looking again at my eyes. She spread her legs and reached for me as I got lower. She felt my finger enter her and then let out a moan. I fingered her with a bit more enthusiasm. My tongue explored her opening from side to side in circles.</p> <p>Her moan turned into a gasp and I felt her legs start to twitch. "That's fantastic," she moaned.</p> <p>"I want more," I said.</p> <p>"I want more," she said breathlessly.</p> <p>"I want more," I heard and felt my cock grow hard in anticipation until I felt that it was throbbing for attention. I had felt something like this many times but never before in real life. Something had been different but never in a porn movie.</p> <p>Before I had even taken my cock in my hand I felt it pulse slightly. It jerked and twitched in the air and felt as though it could come loose. I knew she was watching it and it had surprised her. I put more pressure against the skin and pressed slightly but it still twitched in response, which pushed her towards orgasm too.</p> <p>"I'm going to come," I gasped as the sound of it brought my cock to an even more urgent throb. I could feel it pulsing and twitching and knew it was about ready to explode in a huge stream onto her. "I'm going to come," I told myself and looked towards her. "I'm going to come," I gasped.</p> <p>There was a look of surprise on her face. I felt the blood rush to my cock in response as I felt her juices start to run down my hand. She felt it splash down onto her and clung to me like a little baby. I felt it run past my cock head and down into her pussy. "Now it's my turn to jerk off," I said and felt the first jolt of orgasm in it's time to erupt. My first pulse of cum hit her right at the base of my cock in what felt like the first time I had ever ejaculated. The force of the spurt sent a gush of cum directly into her as it twitched, pulsed and throbbed and shot out of me in waves. I watched as it jetted and spurt but not until it stopped did it finally cease ejaculating and my whole body went limp.</p> <p>I saw her eyes as she lay there watching me. I thought I would collapse. Suddenly there was a loud click as an alarm clock went off and the room came to life. "Shit," I said. I got up and looked at my hand. "I've got to go," I lied and she nodded, smiling. She put her hand to her mouth and a slight smile went up her face and said, "I've never had a second date and thought it would be great."</p> <p>"This was our first and only date," I told her.</p> <p>"We were really good," she said. "I'd love to have one more date and enjoy it." She reached over and kissed me again and then she said she was ready to get up. We scrambled to our feet and she laid back on the bed. I grabbed the towel and she pulled me down and we got back into bed. I felt her warm body as it felt wonderful on my nakedness.</p> <p>She turned over as though expecting me to be there. I started to protest. I watched her eyes and then her skin. They were so beautiful. The contrast was remarkable. And if she didn't want me, she'd better not be thinking about it. We didn't move for a while.
