They just wanted to do what ever it was. I'm sorry.' His fingers caressed her belly as he said those words, and she began a rhythm of little movements with his hand, then slowly, ever so slowly, her hips rising, and slipping as she ground herself against the length of his shaft. It was all so strange, and it seemed like a dream, but she knew what she wanted to do, and that was no dream.</p> <p>Her head moved from side to side as her mouth moved from his mouth; her fingers moved as she began to rub her mound against his body. 'No,' she said again, 'no one's ever done it before, and you can do it...,' she looked at his cock, 'and maybe others can too, but no one ever had...' She turned her back to him and moved one leg between his outstretched legs, so now she was looking at his cock. 'Do...,' she looked, 'do you want more...,' and she held her breath as she saw his cock jump as she squeezed, then she saw how it slid up and down, and as it did, she could feel herself quiver with excitement, and she closed her eyes and tilted her head back, so she could feel his cock moving along her crevices through the thin cotton of her panties.</p> <p>'This is...' she thought, 'just... just too...,' she put her arms behind herself and she moved away from his hand, so that now his hand could join her; and as she did so, she put one forearm on the back of his neck and moved it up and down, in time with his movements.</p> <p>The hand moved up her side to her breast, her body moving in time with his as if it were going to slide itself between her legs. Her mouth moved from his, and she pulled back as if she was trying to speak, 'no," she whispered, "just do it. It's what you want...' she opened her eyes again, and she was afraid she had just taken herself over, but then her fingers moved down and brushed against the tip of his cock, and the hand tightened it, and all at once she felt his hot wetness, and as she slid further up his arm she began to feel like she was coming out of a tunnel. She closed her eyes again and let her hand run over as fast as she could, but each time down it became shorter and slower and, suddenly the orgasm seemed to sweep away her. She wanted to speak, wanted to say anything, but she could do nothing; all she wanted to do was hold him and press herself against the skin on his arm, wanting his hard body in her hand.</p> <p>At last she had gotten out. She had been lost in the sea of sensation as she thought about what it was to have a man, or woman in her hands. She had wanted so badly to know a man's penis. She wanted to be able to feel something other than what it felt like inside her hand, but she had kept her doubts to herself. She didn't have the courage to tell another man that one. She had never thought of herself as queer, but she had always found it flattering to be noticed, loved, and desired, that in itself made it all so easy.</p> <p>Then she thought of her own penis, and her hand moved back to his shaft, and she began to rub, moving it slowly as her breast and hand slid up and down. Her other hand moved along its side, and she moved along his shaft, and she closed her eyes; she lifted her face, and as her eyes met hers, the heat from her face, and her smile, sent pleasure into the boy's body.</p> <p>'Don't think,' she said, 'just do it...' she looked back up at him, and he smiled back at her, his eyes twinkling with pleasure as the thoughts, all she had ever wanted, had always wanted to do, and she moved on his arm, moving her arm back just a hair before she lowered her body again. She moved her fingers down, over his abdomen, and as they came to the base of his cock she looked again, her eyes were still closed, and she watched as the hand came up and down again, and as her heart beat against hers, the muscles of her stomach tightened and she imagined those fingers were his hands. She moved slowly now, her hand on the base of his cock, but just as she thought, and she looked back at him, her fingers moved up his shaft once again, and as her hand continued to move, she opened her eyes, looking him in the eye, as he looked back at her.</p> <p>The sight was erotic, and almost as erotic as seeing his penis harden, as she imagined his hand slipping over her shoulder, her body.
