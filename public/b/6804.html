He walked over to her, gently touching her cheek.</p> <p>"You don't belong here, you understand, no one should be allowed here, no family, no friends, no home" the tone of his voice scared her.</p> <p>He could feel himself being pushed hard down on her. "You won't be in my home, you are not allowed to go, you can't leave, no one can go, you are not allowed to talk to anyone else here."</p> <p>"My home is just down the road. I will come wherever I want, if you tell me to..." she paused. In a shaky voice she begged "Please". When he got to the back of the apartment, she was waiting for him outside the door, he saw her laying on the couch wearing her white tank top and boyshort cut-offs. She pulled on her shorts, buttoned up the back. He watched her from the doorway. She opened the front door, walked into a living room and closed it as he entered.</p> <p>"Please, let me go!" she pleaded.</p> <p>He shook his head.</p> <p>She looked up at him with tears forming. "Please",</p> <p>"Please can I kiss?"</p> <p>He placed a kiss on her lips and leaned in to kiss her gently. He could feel her melt, she didn't know what to do as he lightly brushed his lips against hers. She started to kiss him back, they kissed, their tongues mingling with each other. She reached up to hold his face, pressing her lips against his. She started to press against him. She was so hard and he could feel it in his pants. The first time she kissed him she put his whole face into her mouth, licking from his lips to his chin and back to his face.</p> <p>He lifted her shirt from the couch with her hands. He pulled off her shirt, he could feel her skin slide over his skin. Her tits were hard and he could feel them press against him. He dropped her shirt to the floor. He undid his pants and slid them off his hips. His cock was in full view.</p> <p>She was on her knees, he could feel her tongue run over his balls. He felt her take his cock in her mouth. He had the back of her head, he could hear her gurgle, and then he felt her start to slowly move up and down. He ran his fingers through her hair. She moaned as she took him deep into her mouth and she started to take him slowly. He took in every inch of her, loving the feeling. He was in heaven by the feeling of her tongue fluttering up and down over his head as she brought him to full stiffness in her mouth and then slowly down, taking him deeper each time, until all she could feel was the fullness before her mouth would stop.</p> <p>She sucked him till she thought she would choke and then sucked him again. She took him out, he was about to come, but she stopped before he did. He tried to grab what he could of her hair but she moved up towards him. He saw her pull back her shirt again, she slid it over the top of her breasts as she took him in. "Take something, " he begged.</p> <p>She unbuttoned her shorts and pulled them off. She was naked again. She took his cock and slid it into her as deep as it would go. He felt his head touch the insides of her tight wet pussy. She was breathing heavily. He could feel her pussy squeezing him as he pushed her back a bit to get more penetration deeper. His hips started to thrust slightly harder with each forward thrust until he was almost out and then in again, as deep as possible. She groaned in his ear as she started to shake on him.</p> <p>He pushed all the way into her.</p> <p>"Fuck me", he shouted.</p> <p>That only brought him on more. She was squeezing him as hard as she could. He could feel her pussy clamping around him. Then he started to push and pull in her again. "Fuck", she cried, and then she was coming, his cock inside her. He saw that her juices were running down his balls, he could feel them as they started to clench around him as he continued to thrust in and out of her. Then he stopped.</p> <p>"You are a good girl", he said with a smile. He went to get up, but she stood there holding on to him.</p> <p>"I need to, " she whispered, "I just want you to take me".</p> <p>As he went to get up, he could see her smiling, not saying anything. He turned her around and leaned her up onto the couch. He picked up a pillow, laid on top of her so she could see where he was goingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
