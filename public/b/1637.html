The rest of the story? So we haven't done anything else. Well there's a couple of things we've thought about, and we want to bring it up later to see what your input is."</p> <p>I'm listening as far as I can without actually talking, just letting him take notes. "Well I think it's mostly about you. What kind of woman would I think, when you get me so aroused?"</p> <p>"You just wanted to see if you could make me even hornier, right?" He laughs. "Or maybe you could think of something else to think of besides my dick and then we could continue?"</p> <p>The thought of doing that with him does nothing to make me come. I'm not ready to go down on him yet. I haven't been with any other man in so long that it doesn't even feel right to kiss a guy, let alone do it. I've probably told enough stories to know what to expect from men in general and what not to do. All I've ever done is try not to really give them oral sex. They've done some fantastic stuff to me. And I've had a couple of boyfriends just that way, so it's not a big deal. It's just kind of been a letch, I guess."</p> <p>"Not to worry. I've dated a couple of guys before but they were nothing compared to how you and I've acted tonight." I smile at the thought of him being with a woman, like we have been since we first met, but now I'm not so sure about that either. But I think about kissing him, and I feel like I could just do that anytime just about now.</p> <p>"That can be arranged." He's just nodding his head as we sit there still looking at each other.</p> <p>I'm getting frustrated, feeling like the only thing I'm sure about is how I'm feeling about him. I want to make love with him, I want to have sex with him. But I don't know how to even ask him that. I don't know if I should. But I think I would just ask if he was ready to do that with my lips wrapped around him, or I could just have it on the couch if I wanted to hold onto that cock.</p> <p>"Well. Maybe I can hold off for a little while."</p> <p>"Maybe not." His jaw is clamped in a smirk. "Do you want to get down and dirty?"</p> <p>I have no intention of getting down. I'd have gladly laid down on the couch right now, giving him the ride of his life. But I really don't want to do anything other than to get him to agree. "Maybe I don't want to."</p> <p>"Well, do it. I want you to do it," he says, sitting there looking at me and his eyes.</p> <p>How stupid I'm being isn't going to be difficult, I think to myself. It's just a lot to ask of him, even if he's willing to do it. He just stares at me, doesn't give a damn whether I want to do it or not. So for the first time, I'm going to just make myself do it, and have him to myself anytime I want to. "Sure."</p> <p>"Good, because you just might have to do that later."</p> <p>"I can't wait."</p> <p>I'm sitting there staring at him, thinking how he's still sitting there, waiting for me to make up my mind. My heart is racing, my brain is still in a daze. My stomach feels like it's turning itself off, and my pussy is soaking wet. My nipples are all over my shirt, and I swear I'll be able to see it soaking through to my skirt, if I look around, but I don't dare. That would lead to something worse. But at the same time, I really can't just take back control now that he's sitting there looking at me and all of the things I can do to myself at the same time.</p> <p>I need one thing to do for him. I've got to go and ask him how this happened. I know he doesn't want to know, he just loves that I'm letting him do this, that he gets to play along with me, that I'm willing to do it to me, just for him. So what is it? I can't just throw in this crazy scene, and let him know that. How can I ask him to do it?</p> <p>I don't know how to get my hand into my blouse, but I grab it and my hand is soon in my bra. I'm not exactly super tight, but I'm probably still thin enough that it's more comfortable than uncomfortable. I'm not very large but I think I'm a little over six feetâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
