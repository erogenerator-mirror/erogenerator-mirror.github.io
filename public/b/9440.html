I began to say. "I don't..." She cut me off.</p> <p>"I was...just thinking, you were so...oh!"</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Yeah, really."</p> <p>"And you...what?"</p> <p>"I don't know."</p> <p>"I don't care what you think, you can just forget about it."</p> <p>"You have to! I will never do anything to you. I just want to be special!"</p> <p>"OK," I said. I took a deep breath. "So...what is it?"</p> <p>"We are going to do a party, we have to meet a lot of new people! Are you interested in that?"</p> <p>"Sure, anything!"</p> <p>"OK, great, I'll be there."</p> <p>I hung up the phone and wondered.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>I looked over at the clock. It was just after five o'clock. I put my key in the lock and then we went inside. We went into the living room where we found a big table and were served champagne, the last of the cake we'd been eating had been put out.</p> <p>"I didn't make anything for you. So I'll go start lunch and then we can continue with our evening."</p> <p>"You know, I have a surprise, too."</p> <p>"What's that?"</p> <p>"I was going to cook you your own meal."</p> <p>I turned around, the cake I just started had gone and I had to eat it.</p> <p>"Oh, that makes sense."</p> <p>She poured us each a glass of champagne and I turned around again and had to look at her. She was not as fit and trim as she had been several months before, but she had filled out nicely. Her breasts were bigger than I'd imagined, but I didn't think, I guess they may have been a B cup. They were firm and full and had a nice weight on them. Her belly had become slightly wrinkled but it wasn't like the others, only slightly flatter. Her legs were longer, not muscular like mine. Her butt was smaller but they were still firm and looked firm, round and plump, the flesh in her thighs just seemed like part of her body.</p> <p>"This isn't what I had in mind. Why are you doing this?"</p> <p>"Why? It doesn't seem like a big deal with you, I'm just looking for entertainment" she said, smiling.</p> <p>"There is a lot in business here and most people do what they want to. But here you are, there's an opportunity you never know."</p> <p>We looked at each other for a moment, then she smiled again. "Maybe we should go out to the patio for the cake."</p> <p>We both got up and she held out her hand. I took it and she took mine. We stood in the center of the living room looking at each other.</p> <p>"I'm so happy you're here." She smiled, the last of the emotion had slipped from her eyes. "Come with me. I have the door." I followed her down the hallway to the patio.</p> <p>She opened the door and it looked a bit like a large kitchen but with a wide hallway connecting it to the rest of the kitchen. There were stairs leading down to the patio area and she went down first, her short denim skirt barely covering anything. She walked over to the patio and turned on the fire.</p> <p>I followed, admiring her form. My eyes wandered over her, she hadn't showered since yesterday and her light brown hair was in a ponytail so that it didn't fall all the way to her back. Her body was a bit thinner but not as much as some of the other girls that had been with her. Her tits were small per cup, not that I had done much research so had no idea of their weight. Her ass and shoulders looked firm and tight, her stomach was flat like mine was.</p> <p>She went to the door and I went to the second stair, my eyes had to follow her ass all the way down as she came up the stairs. I could see down her back, where the back of her butt was.</p> <p>"How to do this?" She asked.</p> <p>"Try your hair, I think it's a bit more than shoulder length, but I think it can be done."</p> <p>We both took our hair up and came back down to the patio. We looked at each other for a long moment.</p> <p>"This looks fun." She said. "Have you ever done this before?"</p> <p>"No, never done anything so intense before."</p> <p>"Well, it's not too intrusive. Let me show you what I can do."</p> <p>We walked over to the patio table and she walked with me out of the door of the kitchen.
