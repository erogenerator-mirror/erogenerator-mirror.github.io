Her breathing was getting deeper and her eyes were closing. As my fingers worked her body I knew she was getting close but I wanted to have a little control over it. She began to thrust into my fingers. I started to slip my hand down over her pussy again and she almost jumped off my hand as if she realized what I was doing. She put her arm across my shoulders and pulled me closer. Finally she was breathing, panting, and letting herself relax.</p> <p>I was in no rush. It had been some time since we had come or gone, but I was in great shape and very, very excited. I knew what I wanted and wanted to do and I wanted to make her come. I knelt between her legs and began to run my fingers over her clit. The response from her pussy was almost as amazing as I had imagined. I was stroking her pussy hard and it was not unusual for her pussy to quiver and go wild. She was bucking her hips and moaning loudly as she came and was trying to muffle her voice in her excitement. I continued, trying to prolong the experience. Finally, she began to come back to normal. I put my arm around her and pulled her close to me.</p> <p>I slowly caressed her body and watched her. She was still breathing. It appeared she had taken a lot of time to come down from the orgasm she had been expecting. I asked her if she was ok and it seemed to help. She asked, "Are you okay with what we just did?"</p> <p>I told her that I was amazed that it had happened so quickly, and that she had totally enjoyed it. She assured me she was totally relaxed, but very turned on. I had been sitting beside her and stroking her breasts with one hand as her arm went up and down. She had moved around and could see my hand moving very lightly over her body and the side of her breast. My hand moved up over her mouth and she kissed me. She asked, "Did I do it right?"</p> <p>I leaned back to put my arms around her and told her I loved her. It had been so long and I loved that feeling as my hand slid down over her abdomen and down her abdomen toward her pussy. I could feel my fingers lightly stroking her pubic hair and her skin was soft and sexy. In the back of my mind I wondered if it had been this way over the past few months. Then she said, "How long do I stay?" I told her, that she had the rest of the weekend and I loved her. We kissed. I felt her hand gently rubbing the hairless parts of my thigh. I could not believe she was stroking my pussy again.</p> <p>As I looked down at her I said, "I need to go take a shower. But I would like to talk some more before we do this. I'm not sure I can get any closer than in the past 24 hours."</p> <p>She was getting excited. "Well I may be an old maid you know."</p> <p>"I really need to take a shower," I told her as I got up from the bed. "But you don't have to have a shower."</p> <p>She said, "I don't mean to be too forward!"</p> <p>I got back to bed and held her at arm's length. She was watching me from the corner of her eye. She was trembling, looking at me and asking, "Are you sure you love me?"</p> <p>I smiled at her and said, "Don't you worry about that. You're going to feel so different, but you can tell by the way I look at you right now."</p> <p>Her body was on fire. She was excited and her nipples were hard and pointed. She reached out and touched them and said, "I always got these feelings when I'd go to bed. You're incredible." She reached out to hold my face in her hands and kissed me.</p> <p>Our lips parted and we both sat back and looked at each other. She said, "What was that about?"</p> <p>I told her I was telling her about how I was having sex with the girl from the bar this morning. She said, "Oh, I forgot! Well she was so hot!"</p> <p>The girl was naked but for the panties. Her legs were spread wide, her pussy was wet and glistening. She ran her finger over her swollen pussy lips and said, "God they're beautiful!" and then asked me if I really liked it. I could hardly speak because she was getting really excited. She said, "Yes, I could probably make you happy! I've been thinking about playing with your big cock all morning. Your cock is so big! I've been thinking of it all the time!"</p> <p>I couldn't believe she was talking about me! It was exciting. I loved hearing her talkâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
