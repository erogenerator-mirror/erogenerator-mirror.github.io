"I...I like my body in a constant state of arousal as well. You don't feel any jealousy, just a curious curiosity, a feeling from feeling a woman, feeling that she is the most complete sexual being that I am. It feels like I am going to climax anytime I play with myself when I feel the urge.</p> <p>"Your body is...different. It smells, and you have this sexy perfume. It is intoxicating. I also feel that you may have a...unpleasant...condition?"</p> <p>I chuckled, but then looked at my wrist, and smiled. "I am not sure why that is, but it sure is a nice sign of how my body seems to feel, and how I look. I'm actually glad you have come on to me."</p> <p>Sherry gave me a very sultry smile. "You look like that, aren't you?"</p> <p>I blushed and shook my head. "Oh yeah, well I'm not really sure I would be the same kind of guy who has a girlfriend after a few drinks when she wakes up, who just doesn't think it's going to happen."</p> <p>She just held a finger over her mouth to silence me. "You are certainly not the kind of guy who would be jealous!"</p> <p>"Oh...Yeah, well...I still don't understand why you can't just say no, right? After you get here, you might find she has a sense of propriety about being in such a hurry to leave, or maybe you'll forget about asking a question," I quipped.</p> <p>She seemed surprised, but not entirely upset. She didn't reply.</p> <p>"Anyway...I am a little bit nervous," I said. "If you do anything, anything at all to get me off, I will be glad to help you."</p> <p>"You are a lot of help!" Sherry squealed, a giggle escaping from her lips. "Besides, I'll be here for awhile."</p> <p>I didn't give another thought to what she might just say. In fact, the next few minutes seemed like an eternity. I watched her with her back turned to me. I had to admit that it was an extremely attractive sight.</p> <p>She slowly turned, bent, and put the towel down on a chair at the table before me. Her breasts pressed in from her back, a beautiful roundness, capped by a light pink tipped aureola. The aureola were small and almost no droop, not even a hint of a shadow, much more pronounced on Sherry's skin. My eyes had never left them as Sherry began to unbutton her shirt. I wanted to run and hide from her, but I would have done just about anything to have seen the full beauty of her perfect orbs bounce out into view.</p> <p>Her hands slowly reached back to her sides, and she pushed the shirt up, finally exposing a lovely mocha skinned body. It was clear, that Sherry was a size six, although maybe a little lower. She tossed the shirt aside and then turned so that she was facing away from me.</p> <p>"This was a little weird," I muttered to myself. The question came to my mind from my earlier earlier conversation with Sherry, one that had been quite personal.</p> <p>Sherry, however, was in fact, very pretty, and her breasts swayed with each step as she walked with each sway she took. I was able to imagine her hands all over those perfect skin and to look at her face, to the lovely smile that appeared on her face as we approached in a small restaurant across from an older gentleman who had just moved into his fiftieth birthday.</p> <p>Just as I was about to comment that she was probably the prettiest woman in the place, we reached the car. She leaned in to me, and kissed me on the cheek before turning to me and kissing me on the nose, letting me know that she was just teasing.</p> <p>That's all we said as we exited the restaurant, we were heading for her house. We stood outside before the door, Sherry just looking into my face for a moment before she looked up for just a moment. Her eyes lit up like they had earlier in the day when my hands had been on her ass. This time however, when she returned, I had an equal smile on my face. "You're not being that shy, are you?"</p> <p>"No...No, not at all," she said as she pulled me tightly into a hug. "I am, very, very, very much. And to have you on my side, well..." She hesitated, and then looked down at my hands instead of the door. The look of sadness was back.</p> <p>"Come inside," I said.
