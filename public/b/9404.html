"Don't worry about that. You're here for me."</p> <p>She let him go and said, "Come to my room so we can get ready for tomorrow."</p> <p>He started to go when she grabbed his arm and said, "Okay. I'll call you tomorrow. We both have to work tomorrow."</p> <p>As he closed the office door, he stopped and asked, "So do you have something in mind?"</p> <p>"Of course I do. I was just teasing you."</p> <p>"No. Nothing like that."</p> <p>"Not another blow job?"</p> <p>"No, it's not about that." She looked at him and said, "You're not the only one who feels funny about my attitude towards you."</p> <p>She was just about to tell him that he had his own attitude when she was interrupted by a knock on her door and a voice from it said, "Come in!"</p> <p>Lance got up and took Trudy into the office. When they got to her desk Trudy turned to face Lance and said, "Can I tell you my true feelings?"</p> <p>"Please do."</p> <p>Toni grabbed him and said, "I know but after everything you saw tonight I have to know your feelings."</p> <p>Lance felt tears welling up in his eyes. "My feelings are that of a submissive woman. I'm just a sub with a very sexual urge that demands attention by its own."</p> <p>"Okay. You can tell me. Is that your true attitude towards me?"</p> <p>Lance shook his head. "That's a long story."</p> <p>Toni grabbed his hands and looked into his eyes. "Lance, it is wrong for a guy to go down on a girl that he's just a little girl and I don't mind if you do it. But I'm not gay. I'm not attracted to boys or girls or anyone that doesn't like it."</p> <p>"No, I just like to look at you as a woman."</p> <p>"You're not so bad looking yourself. If I may be so blunt, you're not as hot looking as I am right now."</p> <p>"I'm not sure about that, it's just that you're like me. I'm still a little shy about it."</p> <p>"I like to look at you in pretty, sexy clothes even though I just wanted to have a little fun."</p> <p>"I'm sorry that I got you into this situation."</p> <p>Lance's eyes went to Trudy as she smiled. "That's too bad I wouldn't be the one to break the mold. The truth is I like being this way."</p> <p>Toni put her hand on Lance's shoulder and looked him in the eyes. "Lance you have nothing to be sorry for. I know you don't mind but I've been in this situation before and I know that you have a very strong, submissive nature."</p> <p>"I don't mind it at all. I'm just trying to make a change to my sexuality. I don't want to be a slut."</p> <p>She let go of him and said, "I'll let you figure out another way to change your attitude to sex. I know it will have to be with a girl."</p> <p>"I don't know. I hope that I'm not a slut."</p> <p>"It isn't your fault. You came on to me like a horny high school jock. I don't blame you for that. I've already had a handful of young girls my age."</p> <p>"That's okay. I'm not really that experienced. I guess it's all part of my upbringing."</p> <p>"You must be afraid to be what you are. You just don't know about this."</p> <p>Lance shook his head. "There are a lot of people that are out there. I've already met the girls that are in my classes. I know what you mean about wanting to be a slut. There are no bigots among the girls in my class."</p> <p>Toni leaned forward and asked, "Don't you think it's important to let yourself grow comfortable when you're older. It's just that most of my time is spent in my bedroom masturbating. Don't you find that a little uncomfortable?"</p> <p>"I don't know if I have anything to be worried about but it really does seem that way to me. If I can't enjoy myself and get a little more comfortable I have to be sure I'm not losing my self confidence."</p> <p>"Well I do feel it. I'm very happy you can talk your mind out."</p> <p>Lance stood up and said, "Okay, I accept your point." And then he walked over to Trudy and told her to come with himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
