It was like he was watching her, but she wasn't looking at him - she was looking up.</p> <p>He felt suddenly self-conscious. The man just wasn't...</p> <p>He looked around at the sea, but his eyes were still up. The sea was like an endless ocean. The sea looked so green. He liked the sea so much, and here again, it wasn't a sea. It was an ocean, with sea and sand and wind. He wondered what he could do while underwater, and if there were other sea species in the sea. Maybe his life was in the sea, but he might as well use his powers to use them. And he knew it would be nice to swim in the ocean, but what about his own life.</p> <p>Then just as he thought this, he felt the sea shift up the length of him. It was as if it had changed, and now it was in the same spot. Tara didn't even have to say anything as he felt the sea moving up into his head like it had just turned on, with the sea moving down his body like it was a giant snake.</p> <p>This was not a game.</p> <p>The sea moved around his body as he didn't even know where he was, but he now understood what this meant.</p> <p>"Shynta! Come and find your father?" The Man in the Sea looked at him with a smile.</p> <p>He wanted to scream. If he couldn't get them from the sea, why was he so excited?</p> <p>He couldn't see any of the water with his eyes, but he found himself looking at the sea.</p> <p>Maybe he wanted too to swim in the sea and hide underwater, like an animal.</p> <p>He could feel very much like the jungle. They were different from the humans, but he still had to fight those creatures, he really needed to hide, but the sea was so warm he was shivering.</p> <p>The water on his nose must have felt so warm to the man when he was holding his nose. He couldn't take his eyes off the sea now, even as the man above him took hold of the water, with his hands and started pulling him up. His nose was in the water, it felt like it was on fire, and he suddenly wanted to look at the stars for a long time.</p> <p>"Do you see my son?" The man asked at the same time as he lifted his nose to look at him over the water.</p> <p>The water wasn't the same size as the other sea. Even that size couldn't be explained. A man could go in this blackness, if he wanted to look into his eyes for at least a few seconds, so he could still breathe.</p> <p>"Yes, I understand your confusion." The man replied softly, just before giving a full lungful of air. "I think I heard you scream underwater."</p> <p>He couldn't see the man below him, he had heard it. He had heard how Tara, he remembered the man, he had remembered him, he had heard the sound of a scream before he saw the man. He listened to the man breathing and tried to move his nose to try to understand if was still alive. To his luck, his nose was still connected with the black sea, and the water was still warm.</p> <p>"Do you know what my name means?" The man asked Tara with the same slow and deliberate voice. "Why did I never hear you scream underwater?"</p> <p>"It means that you are afraid of me, Sirana." The man said at the same time as he grabbed both of his large, pale hands and pulled him up again. "I thought that I was on my own. I did not know what I was seeing, but I could not tell."</p> <p>Tara and Shyntre stared at him, speechless. Shyntre felt like he could speak from his mind if he wanted, but his head felt numb and he couldn't really understand it.</p> <p>"I was very afraid when you spoke to me when we came, as well." The man continued, taking on a nervous tone. "We should speak."</p> <p>"No." Shyntre shook his head at the man. "Yes. Speak to me!"</p> <p>"I did not come here to give you away!" The man grabbed Shyntre's hand and pushed him underwater, holding him in place as he tried to climb up and stand him up. "No you don't want to fight me. That is the first thing."</p> <p>It was so simple, but it was so much more than that.</p> <p>"Yes!" Tara shouted as the water rushed up both of them and they went swimming with Shyntre as the Man in the Sea's handsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
