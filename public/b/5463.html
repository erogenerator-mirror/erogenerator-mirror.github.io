So, um, I'm sorry that you were in the hospital."</p> <p>"Oh! It wasn't that. I was just..."</p> <p>Suddenly a bright flash of white light went off behind her and she felt it start to light her face. Suddenly it hit her and something cold slid into her and then it was gone.</p> <p>"Ummm, oh, I'm sorry!"</p> <p>The darkness that she had felt in the hospital bed seemed to leave her in the darkness for a moment and then she could see the blackness of a tall figure moving toward her. Then she saw a large figure. A face that must have belonged to a man. A handsome face that she couldn't quite make out.</p> <p>She was shocked. This was definitely not the handsome man she had seen at the hospital looking at her and getting himself so much fun. The black man had big white teeth looking down at her and was smiling as the mystery man walked up to her. He looked familiar since she was able to recognize him right away. She wondered who this man was and then she realized that she didn't remember him. All she knew was that he was from the hospital looking at her and when she looked away from looking at him she saw that he was taller than any man she had ever had sex with.</p> <p>She heard herself talking to herself. That was him.</p> <p>"Ummm, I'm sorry, I..."</p> <p>Suddenly the black man turned and spoke to her. She jumped back and then suddenly she realized she was saying something like, 'I don't know how you met me', 'I guess I just met someone in the same hospital as you,' and the rest were nothing but random things.</p> <p>Suddenly he walked over to her and sat down on a rock next to her. He took something out of a pocket and handed it to her.</p> <p>"Here, take this."</p> <p>She handed it back to him and he looked at it.</p> <p>"Now, here, take this."</p> <p>She took the item in her hand then put it to her neck.</p> <p>"Here," he said.</p> <p>He handed her an envelope that he handed her and she held it up to her chest and then she saw the small gold ring on the inside. She had one in her wedding and one in her ass and her parents' ring, but had never been to see that ring. Suddenly, even though the mystery man was standing near her she thought that she would die if she let him open the envelope that she was holding.</p> <p>The mysterious man opened the envelope and handed it to her. She took the ring and put it on her finger then pulled her wedding and engagement ring onto her finger. Suddenly the strange man looked over her head and saw that she had on a white eye mask and she smiled. He smiled as much as he could, but then he stopped as she pulled her mask off and started to giggle.</p> <p>He walked closer to her and looked her deep in the eyes. He looked like his eyes were looking back at him. He stared into her hazel eyes as he whispered in her ear.</p> <p>"I guess you just met me right here. Why don't I put this over to your face and then you can put it on right."</p> <p>She nodded in response and then realized that there was another strange feeling coming back to her. She felt like a fool in looking at another person when she thought that he was looking right at her.</p> <p>"You look so sweet like you just met me," he said.</p> <p>"Yeah, you just did," she replied.</p> <p>Then she suddenly realized that she had heard the doorbell ring and the light came on. She stood up and hurried down the path to the door. She looked inside the door and saw him standing there. She quickly opened the door and he slid inside and closed the door.</p> <p>He closed the door and walked to the fire department, which was located in between town and home. He picked up the door and walked right in.</p> <p>"Hi, Mr. Thomas. You didn't have to come in if you didn't want to, but..."</p> <p>He laughed and said with surprise and surprise in his voice.</p> <p>"Uh... Yes, I'm not sure that I wanted to come in the first place."</p> <p>"I wasn't, I wanted you to meet someone else so that you are able to come home properly. I understand that it's just a little thing, but I feel that you need to at least meet someone before you get yourself into trouble."</p> <p>"No, I don't need that, I got to meet someone, I'm not aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
