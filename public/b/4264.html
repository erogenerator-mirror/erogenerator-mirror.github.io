She groaned. "I want to feel your lips on me," she said with a moan.</p> <p>Tom pulled her lips apart and slid his tongue into her waiting mouth. She moaned and opened herself, as her tongue slithered up his tongue. She had a warm, erotic taste, as if she was drinking champagne. His cock responded to her wet folds and he began to slide his cock in and out of her pussy. His cock felt good in her pussy, so warm and delicious. He had to taste her pussy right then but it would be so wonderful and so wrong. That is what this was; a lustful hunger, a wanton carnal desire. And she was right about it now. Her breathing slowed but she kept coming closer to orgasm.</p> <p>Tom wanted to feel her cum, so he started fucking her pussy harder now. Her tongue and lips rubbed against his lips as he slid his cock deeper into the tight hole of her pussy. Her cunt hugged the shaft of his cock as he fucked her. Her mouth engulfed his lips, lips, throat. Tom felt his stomach flutter as he came in her tight hole. He pumped faster and harder into her and watched her face as she came, her eyes closing and her hands gripping his biceps.</p> <p>After a moment, she sat up again, looking at him and grinned. Then she ran her tongue across her lips and opened her eyes. It was a look of lust in her eyes and lust in herself. It was as if he just had the same look of love for her.</p> <p>"It was a great gift!" She said, running her hand down her face and up and down on her tits.</p> <p>"I think we can share that same look," Tom said with a smile, pulling her to her feet and getting a full view of that lovely set of tits.</p> <p>"You want me to be your whore?" Sara asked him, her tone a question and not a question. This wasn't a question on a woman's part, was it?</p> <p>"Of course, slut," Tom said with a smile. "This has always been our code."</p> <p>Tom lifted her into his arms, his cock still hard inside her as he set her back down on the edge of the bed. He picked her up and laid her on her back on the bed, his cock still hard inside her body. He kissed her mouth, her chin, her chin, her neck, and her mouth, his tongue probing her willing mouth. Sara eagerly opened her mouth, her tongue flushing with excitement.</p> <p>The taste of her tongue on his tongue was just as he remembered, just as thrilling as just earlier in the evening.</p> <p>"Ohhh... My... God, that was sooo fucking good!" Sara moaned as Tom kissed her lips, his hardness still inside her.</p> <p>He started moving his cock slowly in and out of Sara. His hips slapped into hers as his cock thrust into her, filling her pussy. Her body responded with a response as his cock moved up inside her.</p> <p>"Tom... Ohhh... Tom!" Sara said as his cock thrust into her again and again, his hard cock pushing against her cervix, sending waves of pleasure through her entire body.</p> <p>"Your turn," Tom said, smiling down at her. "Come on, now we have an idea."</p> <p>* * * * * * * * *</p> <p>Sara laid in the bed in her clothes, her head against a pillow and her body naked next to it. Her thoughts wandered to the scene that she had witnessed the last hour or so. How had she gotten to this point? She couldn't help herself, this was all her life. The way her husband had treated her only made her feel more desirable and sexy, even though her body was still sore from being fucked so many times. Sara wanted to stay this wonderful person but she knew that she had to be more careful.</p> <p>She thought of everything that she had done with Tom, all the times that she had let him fuck her. If she enjoyed being with him, she would be content to let him keep coming by her pussy every chance he could get. They had had sex every night since that weekend; she had never had more than one orgasm.</p> <p>There was something between them. She had loved it when Tom had been fucking her with his big cock. They had always talked of it, her being fucked by Tom. He was no stranger to sex. He had been faithful for the last two years but he would never admit it.</p> <p>Maybe the answer to that question was yes, Sara thought with a smile. This weekend had been the beginning of something exciting and erotic happening. She had made a commitment to herself not to do it again, even if she wanted to. It would just remind her of things that she and Tom had talked about that she did never think about.
