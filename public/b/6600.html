She took a deep breath. "Please, it's too much. I'm just so scared about it."</p> <p>My heart soared in response to the sound of her voice begging as she lay there beside me.</p> <p>"There were a lot of guys in school who liked it when we didn't have to talk. They'd beat us up or kick us out of our beds before we even got to the bedroom. That's what it was. We were always the initiators. We were always the initiators."</p> <p>"But the other girls were there."</p> <p>"Like Mom."</p> <p>"But not one of them would do it to you."</p> <p>She didn't say any more, but all of a sudden her hand was in my crotch. She rubbed my limp penis through my shorts with a firm grip and then it swelled in her soft grip.</p> <p>"You know, you're right, it's too much for me."</p> <p>We were both speechless for a minute or two, and I could only lay there staring as she unzipped my shorts and slipped them and my undies down past my thighs.</p> <p>After all these years she finally got to my naked, erect penis and wrapped her delicate fingers and thumb encircling and stroking it at first, then she worked on it with a growing amount of enthusiasm.</p> <p>I'm usually a quick study at masturbatory technique," she thought as she pumped my shaft up and down, and when I finally came with a powerful cry her fingers flew over the entire length of my twitching cock.</p> <p>"Don't have to look, I've seen you do it a time or two. Besides it's not even 9 inches long!"</p> <p>"I think I can do it," I said with a grin as I rolled over onto my side and rested my hand over hers on my lap.</p> <p>"It was just sex," I managed to say, "and it doesn't mean it's all that much better than watching porn. We both get an education. What would you like to teach me?"</p> <p>"How about what girls were doing to you when Mommy was home?"</p> <p>"Oh, that would be so much better. It would be so much different from what you've seen yourself doing, when you were my age."</p> <p>"Don't worry. You're already getting a kick out of it. I don't know if I'll get another hard-on from it though."</p> <p>"But not for just any girl, that's not a long term relationship!"</p> <p>"Yes!"</p> <p>This time when we kissed after I'd cum she did it again, a long deep full-bodied kiss. Our lips and tongues had already made love to each other the night before, and when she got me up to my knees and rolled on top of me I saw just how much of a turn I was going to get.</p> <p>My first kiss was to go down on her; after we'd both gotten our share of female action, in the past one or two of us did it to each other's breasts. But for most of our early relationship we never got so far as kissing. I was now very inexperienced in what we were doing, and neither of us knew exactly how far I could take things.</p> <p>But as the evening progressed she got a little more adventurous. She'd be lying on our bed in our dorm room, both naked, caressing each other's breasts, nipples, and hips, all while kissing and gently kissing around the outside of each other's body.</p> <p>"I like being with other women," she'd say.</p> <p>"It's not just any other girl you're seeing."</p> <p>"That's the thing about other men!"</p> <p>"Is it?"</p> <p>"That, and a lot more. They all know what to do, and know what turns them on. You've never had a woman kiss you the way you did me."</p> <p>She could certainly tell what I really wanted. I'm pretty sure she could read my mind, the way I kept thinking about mom with the strap-on and the other night she'd had me.</p> <p>"Would you like to?" she asked, her voice more playful, but a little guarded.</p> <p>"I don't know. But maybe we should do?"</p> <p>Our kiss ended, and just like that we lay there in each other's arms, totally drained, and totally satisfied. But at a distance, because when we opened the bedroom door she saw a look of a question in my eyes, and she didn't stop kissing me.</p> <p>That's how it felt that first week we spent together. Neither of us was sure of our mutual feelings, but neither, me or the other, had wanted to leave. But neither of us feltâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
