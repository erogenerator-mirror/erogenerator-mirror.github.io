I asked cautiously.</p> <p>"Yeah, I think we've been very good for a while now," he said with a smirk.</p> <p>"Well, I am not surprised," I smiled, "I can still taste you in my mouth from where I sit."</p> <p>"You're making me blush," he replied.</p> <p>"Well, if I might say so, that certainly does not mean you really will," I said. Then I took a sip of my wine and set my glass down and added, "Not only that, but I had fun tonight too,"</p> <p>"I can't believe you did that," he said as he leaned back and looked back and forth between me and my glass, "Oh wow, did you...I mean, did, you know, really?"</p> <p>"Yes, I do, and for that matter, more than once, anyway," I laughed, "and just the thought that we did something like this...oh my god, did you do it again?"</p> <p>"I did do it again," he repeated, then added, "and it really was...so erotic...but I had more fun doing it later...that's for sure."</p> <p>"I didn't...have much choice, huh?" I said laughing as I leaned forward and took his hand, placing it on mine.</p> <p>"I'm sure you did; but, we'll have too much to drink before we leave tomorrow; now let's get on with the trip," he said as he took my hand and placed it on top of his.</p> <p>As he moved my hand, I felt the bulge in his shorts and knew it must be hard. I leaned forward and pressed my lips onto his and, although he was definitely longer than I thought it was, I pressed them together as tightly as I could, and that made it difficult for him to get loose.</p> <p>Finally he broke the kiss and leaned his head back and said, "It's your turn,"</p> <p>As we finished our drinks, I looked at his face to see if he was laughing or serious; he was. His eyes were looking down as he was. I looked back up at his face and said, "Why don't you have mine too?"</p> <p>"You can do anything you need to with them," he giggled as he reached out and took one of my hands and lifted it down off the back of the couch.</p> <p>As he moved up my arms and leaned down to kiss me again, I felt his cock press against my crotch. I pushed it out toward him and told him softly, "I'm still a little shaky so we may as well go sit down and relax tonight,"</p> <p>He followed my lead and slid into the chair in back of my lounge chair. As soon as he sat down, he reached out and began to fumble with my belt buckle. I pulled my arms out to allow him free access and finally undid my pants. As he helped me pull my pants and underwear down, I noticed that his mouth was just inches from my cock, waiting for the next chapter of our relationship.</p> <p>I stood up, as he reached down to take off my pants and underwear and helped him in removing them also. As I stepped out of my underwear, he leaned back as he removed his own underwear, freeing himself and putting me in the same position. Before I even realized what he was doing, he began to rub his thumb across the head of my cock.</p> <p>I couldn't believe what my husband was doing, but it felt so damn wonderful, even if I didn't think he would. I leaned down to kiss him again and when I did, I felt his head tilt downward and I could clearly feel his hair tickling my balls. I reached down again and felt for his pants zipper, and when I did, I gasped as I took a hold of my stiff cock and pulled it out, it was sticking straight from his waist, waiting to be touched.</p> <p>I leaned down and ran my tongue across the head, then, as expected, I put my head down on the coffee table and closed my eyes as I started to run my mouth up and down the shaft, causing a shiver to run along it, every so often bringing my lips to the end. He leaned over and held my dick in his hand as he sucked it.</p> <p>"I thought I was your first," I whispered to the mouth at my cock.</p> <p>"And you areâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
