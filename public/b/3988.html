Now you can't be thinking about anything except your own arousal as you make your way to your climax."</p> <p>"And you are going to masturbate me?" her face was a mask of panic.</p> <p>"We are not here for sex, ma'am. I'm here for my own pleasure."</p> <p>I felt like a complete dumb ass. She looked at me and took a deep breath. "But I have to admit, I'm having a good time with your fetish. When I get off I'm going to get ready to do something special for my own pleasure. Don't hold it against me. This is my gift to you, my pleasure to you. I want you to watch my pleasure with you."</p> <p>For a moment I thought about just grabbing her and letting her go, but I knew I really needed to make her climax before he got to his. Maybe I could get him to watch her do this from an angle. If he wasn't getting close, maybe I could be tempted to make him do her do it. "That's my girl."</p> <p>I reached behind her and pulled her up, taking her top off in the process. When her top hit the shower wall it bounced onto her chest and landed on the floor. "Now strip."</p> <p>With no idea of what to do I pulled off my T-shirt and my socks and stood in front of her naked. I reached out to take her hands, but she said, "Wait. Don't even touch me. Don't even think about that. I'm in your care. This has all been for fun. You said you'd show me how much I mean by this."</p> <p>With that I bent at the waste and sucked on one of her nipples. She moaned and wrapped her arms around my neck to keep from falling with me. I could tell she was already getting excited. I could feel her body tingle, but she didn't try to hold back.</p> <p>"How does it feel?" I asked.</p> <p>"Kind of good."</p> <p>Just to be on the safe side I kissed her again, my tongue tracing a line around her lips as our kisses escalated. My own desire was building as I kissed up her jaw to her neck, and finally came to rest against her ear and said, "How about when he makes you come? I can't wait to get him into the middle of it."</p> <p>"Are you serious?"</p> <p>"Yes, ma'am," I answered her. "You are in your prime, and you'll realize it in a jiffy."</p> <p>"No," she panted. "I mean it."</p> <p>I put her hands on my shoulders, still kissing her with equal passion. "You love his cock, ma'am. I'm all yours."</p> <p>"I love it, too. I'm so jealous." She seemed to have the answer to that one as she reached out and wrapped her arms around me. Her hands on my breasts, the pressure of her body pressing against me, was exciting me all over again.</p> <p>I kept kissing her, but began sliding slowly toward her. I was about to touch her but could feel a little nervous because of what I was about to do. "I'm not ready for this yet, ma'am. And you're not, either," I said. "Just take care of yourself." I began kissing around her ear and down her neck. As her body began to shiver I kissed her there, then worked my way down her chest to her waist. I slowly kissed down her stomach and across her belly button, stopping when I reached her belly button, only to stop in front of her. "Here," I said. "Let me do that." "No. No, no. Just kiss it." I kissed her belly button. "This is the part that makes a woman cum," I finished. "I don't know what you mean, ma'am," she said. "But I want to do this for you. I would give anything for your pleasure right now."</p> <p>"Oh, ma'am. This," I touched her pussy for the first time with my tongue. It felt incredible. I began licking around the rim and up her lips, but I got nowhere before she began to pull my hair away and cry out so loud I had to call out to try to keep from running. Finally she put her hands on the side of my head just to hold me away and said, "Stop. Stop," while gripping my hair in frustration. I got off the couch and stood in front of her. She pushed me back and sat down on my knees. She was wearing the strap-on, which didn't even hide her beautiful curves, butâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
