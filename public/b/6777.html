He had never been able to reach an orgasm but with the feel of her tongue circling him with the tip he knew he was ready. He felt his body arching slightly in orgasm. He gasped at the feeling her tongue was giving him as her hand cupped his scrotum. His fingers tightened on her shoulders and he felt her hands press against his ass. He felt her thumb trace the contours of his cheeks and as her tongue reached his anus he felt her finger probing him.</p> <p>She brought her tongue lightly to his asshole. He gasped at her contact. She stroked him, pressed her mouth to his cock and then licked the length of his stiff, fleshy glans. She made circles around the sensitive flesh with her tongue. He groaned as her fingers curled around his ass and gently massaged his nether channel. He felt his own cum boil in his scrotum as she pressed into his perineum. He felt her luscious lips and tongue slide up his shaft till it touched the back of her throat. She drew back a little, letting him feel the full length of her neck. He saw her eyes flick to his. She pushed her head down, taking him inch by inch. Then she backed off, looking at him.</p> <p>The smile on her face was dazzling. She reached down and took hold of his wrist. "Come for me," she told him as she stroked her tongue around his crown. It was difficult to make the words as his head rose and fell in her throat. He felt her tongue licking at his tip. "You're about to, aren't you, Mr. Carter?" she asked, taking his full length in her mouth. "Oh yes." Her lips parted and she swallowed him. "Ah yes." Her finger circled his anus, and he felt pressure as a ring gripped him. She pushed her finger in with a second and a third, and he felt his anal ring open. He tried to hold back a groan. "Don't," she said huskily, holding her mouth to his cock as she pressed her finger into him. "Mr. Carter, don't," she pleaded, kissing his cock and moving her mouth from his balls, "I know I said don't, didn't like it. But I don't want to stop. Please, Mr. Carter. If you don't do it..." she lifted her head, looking at him, "Can you please fuck me?"</p> <p>He felt his body convulse at the sound of his own deep voice.</p> <p>"Oh yes," she said, taking hold of his thick shaft. It was the first time he had actually had sex with her. It was a revelation. It was a new experience. His body jerked, trying to push it out. He couldn't. He felt his cock explode in her mouth. "Ugh!" he grunted as the hot fluid spurted from his loins into her mouth. He felt his hips jerking and his cock pulse in her throat.</p> <p>She held him for a moment, then lifted her face up to look at him with a grin. She pulled her finger from his rectum and held it over her lips. "Suck," she said, licking her lips, "thank you, Mr. Carter," and she kissed him. The hot kiss they shared with each other brought his cock to fully erect again. She rose, smiling down at him. "Well," she said, "I guess you're done, too."</p> <p>"Oh no, not yet," he whispered, pulling his cock back into his pants. "Thank you."</p> <p>He looked around. There was a dark-haired girl just across the small room. She was kneeling in the middle of the darkening room holding her chin to the floor. She was holding a glass, which was covered only by a silver thread, and was sucking greedily on the end. She had one hand cupping her breast and one hand stroking her pussy. It was hard to tell from what perspective they were in the dark.</p> <p>"I think we can get out of here," said her colleague, "Mr. Carter? Can you unzip me?"</p> <p>He looked around and felt the softness of her body as she spoke to him. He had done what most people would call boring old men. He was a writer from small-town. The writer's agent called him the hero and he seemed to have been very popular. He had been writing books and he liked to pretend it was fiction. He couldn't write about things like that. But he did what he got. They weren't always the same. In his stories the hero, the character, he liked the heroine. Some hero liked to be the heroine, that's one of the things that made it so popular. He did liked this girl better, and he knew that she liked itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
