As I finished I started to walk out of the door. "I know that I said I am married, but I was hoping that if I stay in this house with you would marry someone else." I didn't know that I had ever said that before. I didn't know that my wife had been the one who'd said that.</p> <p>"It's true love, I love her. I love it. Let's do it. Come to my place and I will show you how love is best."</p> <p>All my life, I had been afraid that I'd feel inadequate as a man. I'd been with my husband and he was never short of sex, but then it had ended and I'd had to go and look for it. "You're a very lucky man, a very special man. I know that I'll always love you forever." I hugged her, kissed her on the lips and left.</p> <p>My father was an important man when I was young. He thought that everyone who took an interest in our family was as stupid as his wife. After a few months of marriage, one of my friends gave me a piece of paper saying that we should go down to my parents' cottage where we could have a romantic evening. So in the summer we went. On a Saturday morning, after a long day of going to the shops and trying to find anything worthwhile, we packed a few things along with his parents' things and walked home. We went the last few miles and stopped at one of my favourite hotels. We met three other guys who were staying there and had a good time, some drinks, and a lot of fun. During the evening I told my wife about my life.</p> <p>"My dear darling have you ever thought that you would be in love with another man?" I said as I sat down on the bed. "Will you marry another man?" She didn't say a word but smiled sweetly at me. A few days later our relationship turned from a silly friendship to something else more serious. We made love, but not a passionate love making. As a friend, I didn't go out of the house without a cup of coffee every morning. So we just sat and waited for the right moment to make love. She didn't want for things to go any further after our talk. "Don't be scared Darling," I told her. "When we get married we'll decide what to do and whether we want to stay married for the rest of our lives." And then we started to make love and she kept waiting until she got to the point where she couldn't stand it anymore. I got up and took her in my arms. One after the others followed. I carried her to the bed and sat her down. I undressed her in front of me until she was naked with me. My erection was already pressing into her pussy, while the other three came and sat on the bed. A few minutes later, they all saw my cock coming through the wall. They all got up from the bed and watched, drinking and making comments.</p> <p>When I took her in my arms and kissed her, I told her that I loved her. I told her how much she meant to me. I told her how I truly missed her and how much I had missed loving her. And when I said that, I said to her what I told my father did to me. "Tell me," I said. "Can I be your lover and be with you every year?" She nodded her head. "So, when are we going to get married?"</p> <p>"Soon," she replied. This time there was a little pause while our words went a little deeper. "Soon?" she said again. "Are you sure? I don't want to get you into bed."</p> <p>The next day I thought that she meant a lot to me. She asked if we could go to a beach that we were stayingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
