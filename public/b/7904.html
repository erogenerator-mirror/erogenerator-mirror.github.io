Why don't you stay overnight and I can find you a nice present for Christmas. In the morning you can have another great bath and get to bed. When you get ready, bring your favorite present!"</p> <p>She closed her eyes and felt herself blush as she smiled, kissed me and returned her loving embrace. Her hand stroked my cheek and my dick began to rise back to full attention, "Happy Christmas!" she said as she closed the door.</p> <p>She climbed into bed naked and I wrapped a soft towel around her body and tucked her into bed. The towel felt so good I almost cried. I slipped out of bed, grabbed a clean pair of underwear, a silk robe and headed for the shower. My bath was so relaxing, almost therapeutic, that I almost forgot about my present.</p> <p>I stepped from my bathroom and felt the water running over my chest and legs. I got into the shower, washing my hair under the hot water, enjoying the feel of it, enjoying my wife's body. The warm, soapy water slowly washed over me, making me feel relaxed and secure. I stepped out into the tub, and turned on the water. It was like my body was being caressed into a state of euphoric relaxation. I closed my eyes and was just about to relax into the tub, when I heard the water turn off.</p> <p>"Ohhh..." I breathed and opened my eyes. I closed my eyes tighter, but no, I could have sworn I saw a smile on my face. I smiled back as I slid my hand inside the bath robe and I found a set of black high-heeled shoes. I found a pair of silver, six-inch heels and stepped into them. I walked over to the mirror on the bathroom wall and turned it up. The heels looked great on my feet. I walked over to the vanity and checked my makeup. "Not too bad" I said, "just a touch of lipstick and a touch of mascara is all". I smiled as I brushed my lips. I turned it up and brushed my finger along my cheek. "That looks so nice!". I leaned forward and touched my lips with my lips and, while I was thinking the words, I let my lips brush lightly across my lips. I felt myself smile and smiled back. The lipstick made me feel that this time, I was going to wear this dress and makeup to the dinner.</p> <p>I made my way back into the bedroom and laid down my red, spaghetti strap dress on. It was the one from the store we had gotten for Christmas, a matching set of red thong panties and I decided it looked like the "I Am the One" dress that it was. I slid the dress on and took my underwear off. I lay the dress on the chair and started to put it on, I couldn't stop the smile from being forced from my face. "It looks like my gift" I said as I started putting my panties on and I started to walk towards the mirror. I felt my dick growing and as I looked me in the mirror, my mind started to wonder. I saw myself, my dick and my underwear, and it took my breath away. I didn't know why I wanted to do it so bad but, I also thought, I had never loved the dress so much before and, now, I was just going to dress up just for the occasion.</p> <p>"Wow, that's just weird." I finally said to myself as I stepped back into the underwear and put the dress into place. I looked at myself in the mirror and my cock was swelling back to full attention even before I had stopped thinking. It didn't feel like the dress though, it felt like silk. It was hard to describe. As soon as I put on my panties, I felt the lace that covered my entire body as it slipped between my smooth lips. I smiled as I felt the lace against the fabric of my panties and let my cock be stroked. "G'day!" I said out loud to myself and walked out with my legs crossed.</p> <p>I got an instant boner and saw myself in the mirror and saw myself to be dressed in all my clothes. I was really becoming sexually excited at my appearance and thought that I must be a slut, not just a wife. My heart beat faster as I realized that in spite of everything I was a beautiful and sexy woman. I couldn't tell if I was turning myself on or if I was just imagining it.</p> <p>Finally, my heart stopped racing and I walked into the dining room where my husband and his wife were sitting and I couldn't wait to talk to him. This time I met an elderly couple and they talked a little bit and I noticed his wife looking at me and smiling. My husband looked like he was going to ask me to dance if I didn't wish it, but I didn't like the thoughtâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
