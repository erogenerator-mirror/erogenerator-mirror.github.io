My hands were shaking and my eyes were watery. I was suddenly afraid that he would stop, and leave. Suddenly, I thought. I needed to take it slow. He was tall -- in the same height as I was, even if he couldn't see me looking at him. I had to think of something to make him stop.</p> <p>I grabbed the coat and opened it slowly, as if it was a big hurdle I didn't want to get stuck in. I looked at him and he couldn't meet my gaze. Then I noticed the expression in his eyes -- he was clearly turned on. He reached out and ran his hand over my bare leg, but before he let go I stopped his hand. "Please, please, I think I need to take this off."</p> <p>He held out his hand and pulled it toward me, opening the coat, then the zipper. I stepped out of the coat and was standing in a dark hallway that led into a dimly lit, expensively lit room. I looked out the window and felt my nipples harden. I knew he could see me. I took his hand, and we stepped out into the light.</p> <p>He stepped toward me, closing the coat and throwing it on the floor. Then he opened my blouse and I let my bra drop to the floor. I could feel his eyes on my body, a feeling I was still struggling to achieve -- an instinctive response -- to me.</p> <p>"You're a good, beautiful woman," he whispered.</p> <p>Slow and carefully, he unbuttoned my blouse, and slid the sleeves from my shoulders. Then there were the straps from my bra and I leaned my back against him on the couch. He slid the straps down, then slid the blouse off, tossing it on the couch with the rest of the clothes. I stood only in my panties but he was still staring at me, his eyes exploring my body.</p> <p>"Take them off," I said.</p> <p>He smiled, then moved toward the waist of my panties. I held the panties in my hands, one leg straight out and the other straight up in the air. He dropped to his knees and gently spread my legs. He looked up at me and I realized this was so much more than just for sex. His hands, moving slowly, on my thighs, and then onto my hips, he reached for my thighs and he turned me toward him. I felt his breath near my sex, and he gently lowered me. I spread my legs, and he put his head between my thighs.</p> <p>"Please don't let me finish," I begged, knowing I should be on my knees begging him to stop.</p> <p>Instead, he pushed my legs further apart and started tongue-fucking my pussy. His tongue was long and hard, and it felt so good I could have come there and then. I felt his fingers on my clit, pushing against my hooded skin, feeling it grow, feeling my body respond, and feeling how sensitive it was, as he licked me and felt me respond. He pulled back, looking at me.</p> <p>"Are you still ready for this, Amanda? Will you cum for me if I make you?"</p> <p>"Yes!" I exclaimed, sounding so eager.</p> <p>He moved over my so that he was kneeling at my head. Then he pulled me toward him and I felt his cock, already hard, between my lips. I opened my mouth as wide as I could, and then he pushed his cock into it. I felt my lips stretch around him as his cock penetrated me, and felt him move his hips. I held still, feeling myself take his size, feeling the hot, hard flesh move about inside me, feeling the pressure of his pubic hair against my chin.</p> <p>"You can stop," I ordered him. "I can't, will you stop? You can keep fucking me just like that."</p> <p>"I'll try," he replied, and began to thrust in and out, just as slowly as he had the first time, but more vigorous.</p> <p>"Ohh, mmm," I grunted. Then I started to moan in rhythm with his thrusts. He held me in place with his arm on the back of the couch, his shoulder against my sex and his shoulder against mine. With his cock inside me, he held me there, holding me on the brink of orgasm, until I had to let my body go. "I want you, I want you, I want you here," I pleaded.</p> <p>"Yes," he responded, then pulled back and started to move inside me again. This time I felt his fingers as he pushed harder inside me, moving in perfect time with his thrusts. With each thrust of his cock his fingers seemed to find a new position, and suddenly I felt like a new person -- one I had no idea how to be.
