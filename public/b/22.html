He began moving his hips in time with his thrusts and when he pulled back and shoved it into my face I realized I had no choice but to swallow this cock. I began to suck it harder and he began to grunt and my eyes began to roll. He was getting close and suddenly I felt his cock spasm and with a groan he thrust hard into me and I heard myself cry out in ecstasy.</p> <p>"Ohhhhhhhhhhhh! Oh my God, I'm coming!" I cried.</p> <p>I heard them laughing and it just made me even wetter. His cock throbbed and twitched inside of me and I felt him come in my bowels. I was in a world of bliss.</p> <p>He pulled back and pulled out of me and sat back on his heels. I looked at the two of them. Both, he was smiling and she looked like she was in heaven. Both were dripping with sweat and his cock was slick and shiny with my cum.</p> <p>"So, you got married," I said.</p> <p>"Yes ma'am," was his only response.</p> <p>"But you do go looking for a new home," his wife said.</p> <p>"Not really," I said.</p> <p>"Well, I just bought a house in an area that doesn't look like anything is right this close to you," he said pulling up his pants and zipping up.</p> <p>He smiled then started for down the road like he was a kid who just won the lottery on Christmas morning.</p> <p>"How have you been?" I asked when he was in the car and the two of them were leaning on me.</p> <p>They looked puzzled and I asked where had you been and I told them that I drove all the way to the airport. "Are you there," I asked.</p> <p>"Uh huh," was all he could reply, and then he said.</p> <p>"I've wondered what you would think if I asked you what you were looking for today while you were taking a bath."</p> <p>"Oh, I think I know what you're talking about but, what is it?" He tried to act cool while I looked at him.</p> <p>"I think you know what I'm thinking," I said. I could feel the flush on my face as I looked at him. It was like all of my emotions were boiling inside of me. I finally asked what had brought me to him.</p> <p>"The thought of being married to a man like you, in fact, just brought on my desire to be married to you."</p> <p>"But, did you have those desires before coming to me," I said.</p> <p>"No," he answered then looked at me. "That wasn't how I pictured it."</p> <p>"Yes," I said. "You know it's not that I was hoping for any of that to happen but the whole thing, it just seemed to be you being you and all of that."</p> <p>"I didn't see you there," he said.</p> <p>"But it's true." Now his wife and I were both looking at each other.</p> <p>"Well," I said. "Well, I guess we did and yes, I've noticed he glances at you a little, as he is doing now. When he stares up we are looking at each other as you look at him. Then you both notice."</p> <p>He reached out and I took his hand. I looked over to see my husband's hand on mine as we touched each other. He said, "He's really a good looking one and I like the way you're looking at him."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm just glad you like him and he's got a good looking cock," I said.</p> <p>"That is for sure. I love every second he lasts. He's so polite, always asking me what I'm looking at with my eyes."</p> <p>"I can agree with that," I said. "So, you're looking for a real live cock now, aren't you?"</p> <p>He smiled and said, "Hell yes."</p> <p>I started the car and said, "Well, maybe I still can't see what we are looking for. This is just to see how far you want me to go before we go there. Do you want me to show you where to park."</p> <p>He smiled before reaching out and taking my hand. I felt his hard cock pushing against my palm and he said, "That would be nice,"</p> <p>The way this was going I had no real trouble.
