He said as he pulled her in to kiss her again, even deeper, deeper than before and she was shocked again when she found that she wanted him to do it more than anything ever had before. She wanted him to fuck her, like he did her before, and she wanted him so badly it hurt.</p> <p>"I would ask again -but maybe I'm not so straight after all..."</p> <p>"What else do you mean?"</p> <p>"When we're doing this I just want to be in you, when I'm in you I want to make everything you feel good about... everything I've ever wanted to feel... and make love to you. I don't know what that is..."</p> <p>"But you've thought about this for so long..."</p> <p>"I guess..."</p> <p>"But... you're married."</p> <p>"Is that what you were thinking I might have to take matters into your own hands..."</p> <p>She was stunned, but not because of her husband's proposal. She was intrigued, in fact it was like nothing else she had ever felt before. And after all these years, she still needed to feel what a man felt when he made love to her and it was only his name she needed to use to get away from the feelings he had for her as well. Then there was the question. "What could I say to that? Do I really love you?"</p> <p>"Is this serious?"</p> <p>"Yes but it's so complicated."</p> <p>"Do you really love me? You can't just tell me this morning, but I don't think it will change anything between us, and if we end up in bed together, even if it turns out the way it did last night I understand."</p> <p>"I'm sorry... I just mean it... that's all I had ever thought about before tonight."</p> <p>"Is this what you felt about last night? Or maybe something else?"</p> <p>"I don't know. It just seemed so natural."</p> <p>There was a moment of silence, "I didn't think it was such a big deal. And I feel that way about other guys, too."</p> <p>He laughed, "Don't be so sure. I knew I would love it, but I never thought it would be anything I really wanted."</p> <p>"I know," She gave him a light kiss on the cheek, "I was just so wrong, and you're beautiful, and I just felt terrible... and I'm sorry things haven't always been okay..."</p> <p>"I don't know what's wrong with me. After all, I had a lifetime of having just been with women and not had the need to be anything sexual with... other men... until I was with you."</p> <p>"I'm sorry if that hurts..."</p> <p>"Stop talking."</p> <p>"Please, let me in."</p> <p>"No, I didn't say anything."</p> <p>"I'll talk to you tomorrow, I promise."</p> <p>"I hope you're not angry," she said, but the look in her eyes made it clear to him she didn't really know what to say. Then he started to kiss her again and she pulled her on top of him, not caring who saw as long as she got out of there, "We don't even know this person... we just... it's just so surreal."</p> <p>He hugged her as they fell asleep in the arms of each other and when they awoke the next morning she was naked and he was fully clothed and after putting on his earplug, "I want this."</p> <p>"I have thought about this all morning, and again now I know I loved it when you asked me to be yours, and once we're married we shouldn't say goodbye until we both have said it."</p> <p>"When will that start?"</p> <p>"I've already told you, I'm not in a hurry."</p> <p>"What do I do now?"</p> <p>"I don't know. It's probably just a bit too soon, especially with all... we discussed before."</p> <p>"We've both felt the same way, now we know that we'd both be together..."</p> <p>"I want this to happen, for real."</p> <p>"I want it. Don't ever doubt it."</p> <p>"I do love you." She said as she started stroking his cock.</p> <p>The day had turned out as usual. The wedding was held at the church and then as the groom started to say his vows a small round table was set up for their union and the bride and groom got dressed as well to go on it. They kissed as a man and lover, kissing and embracing as they did to celebrate their new relationship. As they left for their honeymoon a couple otherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
