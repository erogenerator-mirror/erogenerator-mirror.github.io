"How...where...would...she..."</p> <p>Jason was in the process of undressing her next, when her eyes widened when he lowered them downward. Her ass was naked, her legs were bare. He just stared at it, feeling the fabric being pulled against the skin, and knowing that if she were wearing a panty, he would be able to look right into her pussy.</p> <p>She was as he had imagined; short, blonde, firm, and perfectly rounded. He was thinking to himself at this point with sexual arousal that this was something he would never experience again after all.</p> <p>"Honey, you don't need to..." she said.</p> <p>Jason nodded and went back to his chair.</p> <p>They heard the front door slam and the front door go. With Jason walking over to her, as she was standing there, trying to decide what she wanted, how to say "Hey, baby, I'll be right with you!" with his hand.</p> <p>Chapter 12</p> <p>He watched as she reached up and undid the button and zipper of his shorts, releasing his massive cock which was swinging freely from his waist at her.</p> <p>"Hey, you're really hard...I gotta be honest with you," she said with a smile, looking at his huge shaft in her hand and watching it bounce.</p> <p>"It looks like it," he said as he walked over to her.</p> <p>"You sure do..." she said as she felt his hand caress her.</p> <p>He leaned down and placed his lips on her, slipping his tongue into her mouth as she began to kiss him back. With his body pressed on hers, Jason's cock was resting against her thigh. His hand trailed down her stomach to rest in between his hands, his cock being pressed into the crease of her thigh as he felt her body press against him.</p> <p>With Jason kissing her harder now, she pushed her tongue down into his mouth as she felt her fingers gently rubbing his cock underneath his T-shirt.</p> <p>"Take it off," she said, pulling the shirt away slowly. She had to stop his hands, as the shirt had become tight, and it was so tight that they were beginning to slip off her skin. "And when I'm done, if..." she said as the shirt came off entirely, but that wasn't necessary.</p> <p>"You have a great body," Jason said as he began to kiss her again.</p> <p>"Thanks," she said as she let go of his cock and took his hand and led him to the bed. She sat on the edge of the bed and leaned a back, presenting Jason with her beautiful round butt. Her legs were on each side of him, completely open. His cock was completely exposed in all its glory.</p> <p>"I want a real good kiss from this beautiful man." she said, spreading her legs, and grabbing his cock with both hands once more and began to rub him directly on to her. Her hands worked him as Jason leaned in and laid him on her, his cock pressing into her as she rubbed him back.</p> <p>"Oh god, that feels good," he said as he broke the kiss and looked into her eyes.</p> <p>"Take it off," she demanded. She looked down as his large cock was trapped between his body and hers, his cock pushing the panties against her pussy lips as she lifted herself up, and then letting the panties slip down over his shaft. He smiled as he watched her beautiful cunt lips emerge from the soft material.</p> <p>"Mmm," she mumbled as he felt her fingers pull his cock, and his hands moved up her legs to the soft flesh that was exposed to him. She moaned as her fingertips reached for her pussy, and began to tease and squeeze her sex at the same time.</p> <p>The combination of the kissing and being near him, and his hands stroking her, and then the feeling of her playing with him, made her pussy gush all over his throbbing shaft. Her moans got louder and longer as he let his fingers probe her wet hole, feeling the wetness all over her clit and pussy.</p> <p>"I need to get you inside me," she said as he moved up her body, pulling the soft white material away from her breasts. He kissed her, letting his tongue explore hers as he worked his cock head between her legs.</p> <p>"I knowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
