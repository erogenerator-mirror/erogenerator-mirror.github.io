She's going to suck me dry.</p> <p>Her words are all I can hear.</p> <p>I want her to suck me. I want her to swallow my cum. I want her to drink my seed.</p> <p>Suck me dry.</p> <p>I want her to swallow it.</p> <p>Suck me dry. Suck me dry. You know I want her to do that. I want to hear it.</p> <p>I want her to suck me dry. She's sucking me. I'm going to say it. Cum, Cum, CUM. Fill her hungry mouth. Take me dry. She looks up at me with those eyes, I'm going to say it; I hope her eyes meet mine, and open up and surrender to me. She looks away for a second and smiles. She lifts her mouth off.</p> <p>"That was amazing," she says to me as if talking to herself. That makes me proud.</p> <p>I stand to the side and step closer to her. I'm going to take the head of my cock in my hand and begin to slide it down her throat, but I don't want to give her the chance to back up. So I hold myself up, put my arm back around her throat, just firmly. That's it. I just keep it there while she struggles back up, only to have her pull against me quickly. She stops trying to get up. She stops her struggles, and she grabs my ass with both hands. Now it's not so hard to get my cock down, but my head is still barely visible as I start to inch my way down into her mouth. Once the head of my cock is just inside, I start to withdraw it slowly. I want to watch the head of my cock disappear into her mouth, and watch her take it in. I want to watch the lips of her face move as she sucks me. I want her to do what she's doing, because I can't. When I'm almost out of my head, I pull her up even more quickly, and put the head of my cock at the entrance of her throat. She doesn't push back, I don't push, as I feel her breath against my shaft. I just hold myself there. I don't move when she starts to push back. I feel her relax into me again, and for the first time, she starts to relax and breathe. I'm right where I want to be, she knows and she keeps pushing me down and letting me slip inside. I want her to feel, I feel every vein. She pushes back against me, pushing my cock deeper into her throat.</p> <p>"You feel so fucking good," I say to her. "You fucking slut," I say to her. "Get off me, and get out of the way." She stands there, looking at me with those wide, open, lustful eyes. She doesn't push back, although she looks away, I don't know if she's ashamed, embarrassed. I want her to do it... I want her to look at me... want her to think about it. I want to make her. I can't. I can't do this. What are you doing?</p> <p>She doesn't want to. I think so. I just want her to be there, with me. She doesn't press herself back onto me, I can feel it. I can see, I can sense her. She's getting ready to push back. She pushes against me and I just keep fucking her mouth. We're making love right there and I'm taking full advantage of it. She's breathing is getting shorter, faster, more frequent, now she's grunting and I'm pushing so deeply into her throat she's almost choking me. I can feel how hard she is holding herself against me. She just watches me.</p> <p>"You going to cum, do you think you're going to cum for me. I want you, now," I tell her. "Cum for me baby, cum, for me. Cum for me, and let me make you cum. You're going to make me cum." I say that over and over, and I know she's taking it. She's pushing against me like a steam engine. I really don't care that this is what I want, that she's fucking me, telling me to cum, telling me to fill her mouth, telling me to fill her throat with cum.</p> <p>I'm telling her, I'm telling her I'm going to fill her throat with cum, telling her she's making me cum. She's fucking me, and she's trying to bring me off, to make me cum, to make me cum, I'm saying it over and over while she's pushing my cock back and forth, her face tensing as her body convulses. I'm telling her this is nothing more than pure pleasure, for her, for me, and Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
