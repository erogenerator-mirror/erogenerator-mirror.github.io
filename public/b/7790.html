"I know, babe, it's what they say; "it's ok; I have the solution."</p> <p>She giggled, "Yeah, I sure did just fine, too, but now this is too much. I don't think we're going to be able to make it out of this mess until we get to your house."</p> <p>He smirked, "That's right, 'cause I don't think we even need to get out of there. I was going to do that when I was in my room doing my homework or something. We'll just be a little slower."</p> <p>"Well we'll just have to put some more time in; my mind's a whirl, and I don't want to have to talk to her or anything. I really got to get my hands on her right away, but that's the way it usually is. But here we go again. 'Ooh, this is nice!' 'Hey there! How do I look? Is it too much?' And of course when you're like this, I get all hot and bothered." He laughed.</p> <p>"You make it sound so sweet," she said. She could tell from the way he was gyrating to and fro that there was no going back; she loved it. And even if there wasn't, her body wanted him inside of her.</p> <p>"It's what they say, but believe what you feel."</p> <p>"Oh you know me," she giggled, then added, "and you're very good at it."</p> <p>"Yes, I know," he smiled, and he turned to her. "I'm taking you to your mom's place right now and we need to get away from this weird stuff and do whatever we are going to do."</p> <p>"Uh-huh," she smiled wickedly. "So we're going to do whatever. And after we do, I want you to eat me out; fuck me and then we're going to be together until we fall apart. Can you do that?"</p> <p>"I'll try," he nodded. "It's going to be so awesome."</p> <p>"I like the sound of that," she breathed, but her heart was already beating fast and racing in her chest. All she could do then was smile her most devious smile, and get a thrill from the way he looked at her through those dark eyes. She leaned forward towards him and kissed him; a hot, steamy kiss that stole his breath and made his heart race. "I'm yours forever," she whispered. "Come on, you're not going to hate me for this; just do what you must do."</p> <p>"Mmmm," he moaned in delight, and his arms went around her tight. "Mommy."</p> <p>"Yes, baby," she cooed as he lay there next to her. She rolled towards him slowly and pulled her nightgown over her head. "Take off my nightgown," she said. Her hand went to his shirtless chest and squeezed. "Honey, that's so romantic," she moaned. She had seen his eyes get big again.</p> <p>It felt so damn good to be with that man again, and what he did with the two of them. "I need your dick, sugar."</p> <p>She smiled when she pulled back her head to kiss him once more. "You're not the only one," she whispered. Their lips met again, and she tasted herself on him. She could feel him harden. He moaned as she pressed against his crotch. Her fingers reached down to stroke his cock and it got hard in her palm. She pulled back, took her nightgown away, and climbed on her knees. She leaned into him, so his bare leg brushed against hers, and she rubbed his stiff pecker up and down her pussy before straddling it. She ran her hands up and down his chest and stomach, and moaned when she caught his hands in hers and held them tight against her.</p> <p>"It's been a while, sweetie," she said, as she rocked her pussy over his dick, causing his hands to slip from her. She pulled back and looked at him to make if she were trying to be sexy, but knew she wasn't. He was all muscle, and didn't have a hair on his chest. She rubbed his chest and licked her lips as she lowered herself onto his cock. She loved having her pussy played with. It made her feel like a slut in general, but in her excitement, she really did seem to like it.</p> <p>"Damn, I've missed it and you have me all worked up," she sighed as he slid into her wet wet pussy.</p> <p>"Yes, I love you," he moaned as his hands went to her ass.
