"Oh, baby, that feels so good" was all he could get out, and he was still very vocal when he was deep inside me. And he was very vocal when he came.</p> <p>He fucked me hard that night, for as long as I could remember. I've always been very vocal during sex, and once I came it was an almost continuous orgasm.</p> <p>One night just after the game was over, he told me off and I didn't even think he was kidding, at first. I would get really pissed if he did this. It was almost like he read my mind. He told me that I was so good and loved to play with myself. I didn't know what he meant. He told me he was not interested in seeing me with other guys, but maybe someday I would.</p> <p>We played the next night, just me and Mike. We were not looking forward to it at all. It was kind of wild the first game. I mean, I was only twenty-three, it was only the summer after my high school graduation and it was the same night that I was going to be eighteen.</p> <p>We made it to the net, naked and I was standing in front of him with my legs spread as far apart as I could, my eyes closed, and he was fucking me. Oh, I was getting so wet. But when he told me that he wanted to see me with other guys I was shocked to my core.</p> <p>I was standing up while he took it in stride. I told him I should close my eyes and play with my clit so that I could finish myself off. And I did. He got off of me and knelt down for a quick suck as each of us moaned in our own way.</p> <p>I wanted to do something different. I want him to have me do an orgasm.</p> <p>"Open your eyes, Baby" he said, as he got back on his knees. He looked up at me, with that little smile on his face, and asked me what would I like to do.</p> <p>"I can't imagine having anyone else do that, besides you," I replied, but thinking if I could please him enough to try it. I wanted to try.</p> <p>"Go get them," he said. I walked over to the bed. He picked up his phone, and took a picture of me taking a picture of myself masturbating like I was going to.</p> <p>I went back over to the bed and lay on it, with my legs spread wide. Mike went down on his knees in front of me, and rubbed my clitoris again. I was about to orgasm, and I spread my legs even wider for him. I was close, and I could feel his warm, wet cock as he rubbed it up and down my soaking wet pussy lips. He was getting me very close to cumming. He was rubbing my clitoris and making me come even more. It had been so long since he had gone this far, and now I had to cum a whole bunch to keep myself under control.</p> <p>He could tell that I was about to cum, but wanted to be sure. He stopped and went around on the bed and sat down on his knees, with the head between my lips. He told me to wait as he got off the bed to go into a bag he took out, and brought out two of his big vibrators. He held one of the vibrators in front of my mouth to see how it'd look. I watched in horror as my head was bobbing up and down on it. And it felt so good.</p> <p>After a moment, I looked up at Mike. He was on his knees in front of me with the larger vibrator in his hand and his eyes were focused on mine. I opened my mouth and he shoved it in there and kept his eyes on mine. He told me how I looked. I was still a virgin, but he seemed pleased by that. I was so turned on by my lack of a hymen. I didn't want the embarrassment he was putting me through. I wanted to be what he wanted. I wanted to cum like all girls do on their own.</p> <p>Mike started to cum. At the same time I had my finger in my vagina, rubbing it, as my pussy was getting very very wet. He did not keep the vibrator at all. He shot himself a little on my chest and came all over my face and shirt again, as I had a good grip on the vibrator that still was stuck inside my pussy.</p> <p>He laid down on the bed next to me, breathing hard. He asked if I enjoyed it. "Do I have a big audience?" I asked. "It feels great. It makes me so fucking hot!"</p> <p>I was laying there in a puddle of cum and myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
