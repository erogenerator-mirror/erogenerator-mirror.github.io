As they were finishing up in the kitchen, Kelly spoke up.</p> <p>"There's something you could do for me?"</p> <p>Paul sat up and looked at her. "You know I could give you my cock."</p> <p>"Maybe that will do the trick." She stood up and pulled on her shorts.</p> <p>"No wait I've really got to pee." Kelly hopped off the counter and got on her back and lifted her leg.</p> <p>"What about toilet paper? That's it!"</p> <p>Kelly laughed and walked to the bathroom. She was shaking like a leaf as she walked past Paul. He pulled the covers back and stood up with the water still coming out of the showerhead. He grabbed the tube and walked back to get his to. He bent down and gently splashed the rest of the water out of him. He climbed under the covers and tried to go back to sleep.</p> <p>"You know you've got one better place to do it with." He felt himself grow hard and decided to go a little longer. He flipped on the television and thought about what was going to happen next. He turned the television on and started thinking about some of the pictures he'd seen. Most of them were of naked women. He felt his cock stir at the thought and he pictured what would happen if he actually put it in someone. He thought about Kelly and realized he had to have her.</p> <p>He thought about the possibilities when another thought hit him. He was a few minutes early to his next period. He couldn't wait to see if she had that much fun while doing it herself.</p> <p>It was then that he felt something else. It felt nice and warm on his bare stomach. He opened his eyes and saw that he still had his shirt on. He knew he had to do it.</p> <p>He thought about it and was pleased to see his body responding to his thoughts. He looked down at his cock and saw that it was already throbbing. He pulled his shirt off and stood up to look down in the mirror again. He couldn't hide the fact even if his body was betraying everything it was doing. He pulled the shirt off and stood there naked in front of him. The heat of the shower felt good on his skin and it made him feel sexy. He wondered what his cock would feel like in her mouth or pussy. He wondered if she would let him fuck her. He smiled and decided to do it his way.</p> <p>His cock stood up proudly at 6'2" and he couldn't believe how happy he was to have her here with him. He quickly stripped off his clothes and stepped into the shower. He felt his knees go weak at the thought of her tongue on his cock. When he saw Kelly through the glass door, Kelly looked over and stepped in beside him. He looked at her and thought he could see a little of her hair. He thought his cock was going to come back to life by now.</p> <p>Kelly was very pretty and he felt his cock begin to throb. He hadn't had sex with anyone in a long time and he didn't want to be doing anything to jeopardize their friendship. He knew she was his best friend and wasn't about to jeopardize their relationship at this point. He closed his eyes and just let it happen. He knew he wouldn't be able to control himself any longer so he had to act.</p> <p>He closed his eyes and opened his mouth. He wanted her to know what she was doing to him. He felt his tongue trace along her lips. He wanted to kiss her so badly! It was as if he was doing it for the first time to himself. She reached out and ran her hands down his chest and stomach and finally he felt her fingers touch his cock and he groaned. She took her hand away and turned around and saw his hard cock standing there. Kelly reached out and ran her fingers thru the hair on his chest.</p> <p>The touch of her fingers made him shiver and he wanted to move his hips. He wanted to feel her hands on his cock and he was determined to do it. He reached for her to turn, but she pulled herself away and looked at him as she reached to turn the shower off.</p> <p>"I can't," she said. "I can't." She took the soap that was still in her hand and began to wash it.</p> <p>"Why not?" he whispered. "What difference does it make now?" She looked down at his stiff member and then looked back up at him. She stepped closer to him and reached for the soap. A slight tremble in his lower belly told her he wanted her so badly. She lathered up the bar of soap by his cock and stroked him from the base to the tip. When she reached the tip, she slowly slid her hand insideâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
