And if you still want to know why I asked that you get off my property and can go back home where you belong, now!" I said.</p> <p>"What is this?" he asked as he started to push the material against his balls as they lay on the floor. "Please don't do this...." He begged.</p> <p>"Don't be stupid! I just want to give you an experience that you've never had," she said with a laugh. "Don't you agree?"</p> <p>"Well, I do," he answered. "If you'll keep quiet like you are." He said as he reached down and grabbed his cock and began to stroke his wet cock. He thought he was going to burst when he saw me staring at him.</p> <p>"Do you want to go through with this?" she asked him. She looked over toward me and grinned. I had forgotten just how cute she looked. I quickly shook my head. "Oh, I think it would be fun," I thought. I felt a lump in my throat as I stared at her. I tried not to look at his cock, but I could see his hand moving.</p> <p>"You're so hard, I really need to use my mouth." She said. He was still playing with himself.</p> <p>"That's ok," she said, "I mean, I think you're ready."</p> <p>"I've never been with a girl," he said. "I want to be first," he continued.</p> <p>"Well," she said as she knelt down in front of him and began to run her tongue along the underside of his cock. He had to wrap his hand around the back of her head and push it in closer to him.</p> <p>He watched her tongue move around his shaft as one of her hands began to cup his balls. He closed his eyes as he felt her soft lips on his cock, and his hand began to move in a faster rhythm. "Oh, she was wonderful," he thought. "She makes love with her mouth so soft and gentle."</p> <p>She continued rubbing her lips and tongue along his shaft as her hands continued to lightly stroke along his balls. The sounds of her lips and tongue filling his mouth almost made him come. Suddenly, he felt the feeling of her hand on his balls, and he lifted her head up, startled by her sudden move next to him. "I don't know what's gotten into you," I remember thinking. "This is such a rush...." I thought.</p> <p>She had pulled the blindfold off of my eyes. "Oh my!" I thought. "I'm never going to be able to look at her like those things do to me." After a pause, my friend asked me to let her see the sight of my face under "the covers." "I like it, don't you?" she said as she dropped the blanket to the floor. "I think I'll try it," she said, climbing on top of me. I felt her lips encircle him.</p> <p>"Uhhhh, that feels so good," I told her. She just moaned. I felt her tongue running along the underside of him as she slid herself down so her lips were tightly pressed against my shaft. She began to pull back, and when I could feel the head of us against me, as she pushed her lips harder against me, I felt her begin to suck as she began to move away.</p> <p>She kept pressing, as her lips slid up, then down, and her hands slid slowly up and down along my body as her lips continued to suck. "You're so sexy" I thought as I felt her slowly sliding up and down.</p> <p>She was doing this for a little while, slowly, slowly, teasingly, until I began to arch toward her as she felt my orgasm approaching, and she stopped sucking while she felt it coming. As her lips slid off me, she whispered "It feels so good"</p> <p>"Now, I think we're going to try something else," I said to her as I looked over to me and saw her pulling the straps of my sweatshirt off. "I can't believe how sexy I look" I thought as I watched her tug the rest of my clothes off.</p> <p>"I can't believe you are finally going to go through with this," she thought.</p> <p>"Is this for real?" I thought. "I'm not going to let her suck me off," I said as I looked at her. "I have to admit, I'm a little embarrassed." I told her.</p> <p>"No! I mean.....I want you to put that thing back on." I said, knowing what it was.
