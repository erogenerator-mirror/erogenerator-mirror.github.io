"I love that. That's a nice hug. Why don't you take over for another minute, then. I'm just going out for a while. I don't want to be late." I put my arm in hers and she did likewise.</p> <p>I went outside and got a drink, then put the TV on, turned on the stereo and we both sat on an outdoor floor. She turned towards me, kissed me on the lips and said:</p> <p>"You're such a gentleman, Frank. If you don't mind coming in the house, we could just take this inside together and I could watch some of your silly TV shows."</p> <p>"Sure," I replied, "I'd love to, I don't mind a beer, or two, and a conversation. Do you want one, too."</p> <p>"Maybe we could go for a walk." she told me, smiling. She went to the fridge and started to get us back to our room. Then she kissed me a third time, and pulled away, saying:</p> <p>"Oh, we won't be getting off that floor before we're done. We still have hours before we have to go to work."</p> <p>I put the blanket over the blanket, and got us into the cabin. We sat on the blanket and she pulled the blanket over us. Then she pulled me to her, and I slid into her, and we kissed again. We had one arm around each other and I put one hand on one breast and began to rub it. She put in her hand and began to rub it again. I knew that there was some serious chemistry between us and that she knew that I was interested in her to some extent. I put my hand in the small of her back and felt the round contours of her spine, and then I slid my hand down to the top of her ass cheek. She stopped rubbing mine, and put them on the side of her breast as we resumed kissing. She brought my hand to the top of her leg and I let it slide it upwards until it rested on her upper thigh. Then she moved her hand upward to the inside of my thigh. She felt my erection, and slid one arm over mine to hold me.</p> <p>As expected, we continued to enjoy French kissing, and caressing each other while I put my hand on her leg next to mine and began lifting up her skirt. It was not quite time yet to put me in, and we continued kissing, but we were getting more excited. Eventually she got my hand all the way up under her blouse and felt my fingers moving between her legs, where they had just been. She reached behind with both arms and pulled the blouse away from her body so that I could slide it off. She continued kissing me as I slid my fingers inside of her, and soon we were fondling each other under her skirt. She slid my fingers up and into her crotch, and felt how wet I was getting. She moved my hand out from under herself, and put it between us, and I pushed my fingers up against her vagina and into herself.</p> <p>"Hahaha! That's an incredible turn-on!" she said, and she leaned back and pushed my hand deeper inside of her. This time she was going to take me in and had her own plan for that. She slid her skirt off and stood up with me standing at the edge of the blanket. She had my pants unbuttoned and was about to unfasten them when she stopped her self, and took me by the hand and, holding my hand, led me to the bedroom. We had to keep talking. "I want to watch you put this big cock in me. You'll love it. I'll be a very, very naughty girl."</p> <p>She went to the night stand and got her phone, and, again, I felt her hand go around to my zipper. I felt her hand pulling my cock out, and then I felt her head take it inside of me a couple of inches, then a couple and then a second. "That's amazing, isn't it?" she said, and she started a rhythmic motion of inserting me into her as she felt around her waist. I could only imagine what it would taste like, and I had no idea what she would do. "I really want you to put it in me, Frank," she suddenly said, and I felt her hand stop her movements, then her lips found mine. She kissed me, then asked: "Are you ready to take it all? I really want you, so can you?"</p> <p>"Of course I am. I thought we'd go for this."</p> <p>She led me to the bathroom where we both took a shower, and I began thinking. I knew that it could happen, but this time wasn't so bad. Her mouth was on mine, and my handâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
