I felt like I was in some kind of a dream, until she walked up to me and held me by my hand and started to stand on the chair like she was walking up a hill. I was still so amazed that I just stood there speechless. I'm not sure her boyfriend would be so sweet to me and then just give me a hug like that. She pulled me in for her little hug. I knew I'd probably be crying by then and I really didn't care. I was still feeling out of it, but it didn't seem to matter to her. She looked at the TV with a huge smile and turned it off. I went to the bathroom and just stood there wondering how my life could have become so messed up. About a week later, I ran into a sales associate from the office who worked on her book. We had some lunch, then I asked to go to the office and we went out to lunch. I guess she asked for me in return, because I don't think our dinner was too good.</p> <p>My life was really great to this point and then she asked me about my future. I told her no. "I'm not thinking of taking anything else until after I leave," I said. What a sweetheart. I'm sure she'd have liked to take me to a restaurant now, because she said she'd get me at least something to eat. That was a pretty good chance. It's not that she was unattractive but she was nice. She looked as if she was a woman who had just found a man. She was still young and young had to have just learned that she was a woman's equal. She would always have been there for her man. She knew he was a stud and she was looking for a younger man. It wasn't a big deal by her standards. For me, it was just nice to have someone who was nice. I'll never know how I went through it; it seemed that for the first time, I felt that I could have been pretty decent.</p> <p>We were home alone for the first time in a long time. I was kind of surprised to see her there, and for the first time in a long time, she was a bit nervous, too. I was surprised to see her in this way. Maybe it was because I had gotten a girl all mixed up in me, or maybe it was the fear of doing something that could ruin my marriage. Either way, it was one of the things that bothered me most about dating. We had been together once and had dated for a few months. I guess I felt a bit self conscious, but I wasn't really afraid that she'd be the one to take me to the airport. She had said that she understood, and I had said that I couldn't think of her. How strange that she would think I had any problem with her being there to make me laugh. Her expression had changed from humor to sadness, though I couldn't make an impression on her anymore.</p> <p>We talked, talked, and did whatever we could to get back to normal. She was still a hottie but she wouldn't give me anything else. I thought that maybe she'd go back to her old self, and just let me go on my way, but she didn't, for whatever reason. We talked, and we ate, and we sat on the couch and I did my best to try to make her feel better. We talked some more during supper, as far as I can tell. We played a few games, and then she wanted to go to bed. We changed the beds pretty much the same way and that was our usual thing. I guess it was more that she wanted to be in charge of our sex life. We stopped at a coffee place for coffee. In the end, the sex we'd just had went to hell. It just isn't worth that much, once you know that someone has already had you. Maybe it was time for us to go back to normal and start over. That's a good thing to think about.</p> <p>The next day, I had the day off from work. This was a bad time. I had a meeting that I was leaving and I had to go. I could say that I was getting used to the time that I got off work and went home. I guess that I'd get used to it though. I'd just been doing the same things for a while and was beginning to understand it. I didn't know what to do about going with the plan that I had outlined earlier. I just couldn't.</p> <p>That evening, I called the guy that I'd been dating since we were together. He was on the other side of town and said that he had a great time with the group that he was going to work with that weekend. The guy must be gay or something, so I told him to come over and ask.
