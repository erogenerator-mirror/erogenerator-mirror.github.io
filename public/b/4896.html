You are my brothers and sisters and our friends, but you were all my friends. We all came here to help. And you guys are all part of this now. You all raised your boys off of your parents. They don't know who they are supposed to be serving. But, they do know. I'll teach you."</p> <p>The men were all in shock at this revelation. How could anyone have a father? And what to do, why, why now? He looked around at them all, "I think I understand now. What do we do now?"</p> <p>"We all came here for the same reason," said Edna. "You all came to our village for the same reason. We've talked about it. I know what you all need to do. Tell me what you want from it."</p> <p>"I've got to go. I don't want to tell them again," said Ben.</p> <p>"Of course we will, Ben. We can't leave you alone," said Edna. "Please come to us. We promise we'll do all you want."</p> <p>"Ben, I don't know what to say. I'm sorry. I'll stay here," said Edna. Ben stood and walked to him.</p> <p>"I'm sorry. I'm always sorry. This is too much to ask of you. I know it's wrong. I just can't go home."</p> <p>"That's right. I'm still here. I promise you," said Edna.</p> <p>Ben looked around at the women in the room, and he looked at each of them. Then he looked at Edna. Edna nodded. He was right. He felt his knees grow weak.</p> <p>He looked at the women he'd met, and to his surprise his friends. He looked at the others and laughed quietly. "So the men here, the men in the village, take the babies to those young women who live on their own?"</p> <p>The women all nodded and blushed.</p> <p>"Do you want them alive?" asked Tom.</p> <p>"Of course," said Tom. What else could he say?</p> <p>Ben nodded, "We would love to have them with us. You're all such wonderful kids."</p> <p>"If she wants to stay here, we'll stay here. But of the three of us, it's going to be Tom who'll live here. It's not fair to him to share."</p> <p>"That's why he asked you to come," said Tom.</p> <p>Ben nodded, "If the two women here would be willing to stay, then it makes sense. So, what have you got in mind?" He looked around the room and saw all his friends nodding in agreement.</p> <p>"When Tom asks us to stay, we've got to go back to his village," said Tom.</p> <p>"Well, what do we do? He told them he loves them!"</p> <p>Tom looked at Ben and said, "They don't mind. It's good for them to have that kind of freedom."</p> <p>Ben looked at Tom with a questioning look. "Are you sure? I mean, they can stay as long as they want."</p> <p>Ben saw Tom nod and turned back to him and his parents. "Okay, kids. Don't worry, we'll stay here." They all left the room.</p> <p>There were other women in the room. They all looked at the man they now called Ben. They were smiling in anticipation and anticipation. This man was going to make his daughter happy.</p> <p>He looked around again at the women. Some he knew. He looked at the men they all knew from the village. "Do the men know?"</p> <p>Tom nodded, "They all know. Do you have any idea how much they love their babies? Every time you take a mother, one of them will get you all pregnant."</p> <p>"That's why they're taking us?"</p> <p>Tom laughed, "You've all got babies." He looked at Edna: "You can feel us, but they won't know whose you."</p> <p>Ben looked at everyone then back at the women: "They know? How?"</p> <p>Edna looked at Ben, "I think the women want it too."</p> <p>"Why don't you show them?" laughed Edna. She put on her best face.</p> <p>Ben turned around with tears in his eyes. He looked at them, and said, "I'll never be able to forgive himself if he doesn't give our sons the same kind of freedom you've always given him."</p> <p>It was Tom's turn to look at Ben and then back at Edna. "Do we have any idea what will happen if we leave the village?"</p> <p>Tom was smiling at Ben, "They don't know!"</p> <p>Tom saw Ben look at him, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
