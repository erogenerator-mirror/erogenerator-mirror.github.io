It had never happened this way with the other men of our acquaintance. Now, it was just another man. That was all. It just felt this way. This man had turned so strong and was all that he was. Oh the feel of him. The strength. The feel of control. The fear... the anticipation... the excitement.</p> <p>What a good place to be. This is where he was. It was him. This was him.

You scared me!"</p> <p>"Why are you hiding, Ravi?"</p> <p>She turned to go back. Then he turned back again. She turned, "You can come in now."</p> <p>"No!
