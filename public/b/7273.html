I asked.</p> <p>"Actually, I'm wearing a thong, but it's pretty obvious. It looks like it's just covering a little ass."</p> <p>"So the bra is doing its job, isn't it?"</p> <p>"Yes, it feels great to put my breasts on the bra."</p> <p>"You won't need a bra, will you?"</p> <p>"Not in your condition, but I think I'll take care of it now."</p> <p>Toni was still staring at me, and the look on the older girl's face brought me back to reality. I looked to Rachael. To tell her Rachael's breasts weren't hidden by a bra was to tell her I had never had a girl as old as I have. I'm only going to be in the Navy for a year, and it would be difficult to tell for sure what size I was before, so I was more than surprised to find one of her breasts uncovered. I looked up into Rachael's eyes and saw an amused look on her face, and she smiled and waved at me.</p> <p>"It's very hard not to. They look great, but it hurts when I lift them so it sticks out even more."</p> <p>"Do you think it's too awkward, and I know it is difficult to get it up?"</p> <p>"Well, it can be done, but it can't seem to go up, so you need to be sure."</p> <p>"I've been thinking about this, Rach. The way I got the courage to say that you have amazing breasts, to tell you about my bra-less condition, and show you how easy it would be to get them aroused." I laughed at the joke, and Rachael's smile grew wider.</p> <p>"Thanks..." she said, and turned back to the magazine, still talking to it.</p> <p>I looked around the room. In the corner corner of the bar there was the chair that had been occupied a moment ago. On it was the same piece as in my room, but there was this other chair, with a couple pieces and a set of straps similar to the ones I'd seen in the corner of my room a little while ago, and another set of straps and an assortment of other accessories. I started to get upset.</p> <p>"Why is everyone sitting around like this?" I asked her.</p> <p>"I'm just trying to help," Rachael replied. "It's really helpful."</p> <p>"This is a pretty good job, I'd say. Thank you for suggesting it."</p> <p>"You're really welcome. I'll have to try again, in the mean time."</p> <p>I finished my drink before we started back to the room. Rachael was still talking to the magazine, so I excused myself, saying I'd grab a few more drinks at the bar and grab a cab, if Rachael was ready to leave.</p> <p>"So what are we doing tonight?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don't know," I answered, "it depends on what you were looking for."</p> <p>"No, I was just thinking about maybe going to see The Lion King. This is so much fun!"</p> <p>"I haven't seen the movie, yet," I said, trying to be careful to not let Rachael tell that I hadn't been paying her for an evening of fun.</p> <p>She looked at me, and seemed to be surprised, but she nodded her head, saying "yes, I think that would be fun, anyway."</p> <p>She gave a big smile as she took my hand, and led me to the lobby, and through the door at the back. We paused at the reception area for an order of chardonnay, then went to a table and sat down. We had dinner with our friends while we waited on Rachael to leave. Rachael took one order and then was quickly back.</p> <p>"You're leaving with me this evening, aren't you?" she asked Rachael. "That's all I need to ask?"</p> <p>"I think I might even be tempted, but I can't wait," Rachael said. "Besides," she added, "I may have even started wearing panties. You know, when they are hiding, you might find that's much more sexy."</p> <p>"No, wait, let me." I said.</p> <p>We sat on the bench outside in the hot sun, waiting for Rachael to come back and get us something to drink. We made our plans; Rachael was supposed to be back in about an hour, and that meant that she had a bit of timeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
