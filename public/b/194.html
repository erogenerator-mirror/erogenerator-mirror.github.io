I knew I should have, and if I kept him, I would probably end up with a lot of regret, not to mention a lot of broken relationships. But now, I guess I’m done acting like a fool, what to do? He’s my brother now, I can’t just let him ruin all my good moods and ruin his good fun. I mean he’ll be out of the way when he gets home from work or whatever tomorrow. I’m not sure how he’ll react to all I have made him do, but he doesn’t have to be around for us to be friends. What I just did wasn’t what he expected, and I apologize, I really did. If I hadn't done it, I probably wouldn’t be here now. Maybe I would have stayed with him instead of going home. I wonder if that makes sense to anyone or what I’m thinking to him.</p> <p>I can’t seem to think of the right way to respond to him. I really hope he understands that I’m not his type. I guess I need to be nicer and I can’t seem to let him off that easily. I’m glad I had the courage to tell him this. I think I had a good time, and I hope I can continue doing this, the thought of what we had just done makes me sad. I really just feel bad for him and really sorry for everything I’ve done and let him ruin his good time. I hope he will forgive me. If I didn’t do this, I don’t think I could live with myself.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Chapter 4:</p> <p>When Matt gets home tomorrow he decides to give up on all his plans to have a good time with me. He can’t find any reason to come over to my house or my place any more, in any place at all. I don’t really feel bad about it, it’s the same way I feel when I start dating someone. I’m happy for him, it’s just that it seems like such a long time ago now and it makes me so sad.</p> <p>We have a lot of planning to do after the party tomorrow; he’ll need me for that. I hope he’ll be good for me tomorrow. I think he is, he seems to be kind of anxious to get away but I don’t know. He said he’ll talk to me about it. He probably wants me to be happy and see things between us.</p> <p>I guess I could always get involved with Mike, but then Mike is my best friend, and Mike is my boyfriend. I know I probably shouldn’t but he just doesn’t bother me. I can imagine him trying to think how he’s going to deal with getting away from me. Besides everything has been so long and it’s not really going to fly. I can’t forget Matt, he’s just like all my other guys, he just didn’t seem like a good person. I guess I never would have gone along with our plan, I guess I never would, but I have to make an effort with him, make amends with him and find a way to keep living my life.</p> <p>Maybe I’ll meet with him tomorrow, to make up for my stupidity. I’m not sure, maybe I should. I’m not sure what I would do with him, I guess his life really is really complicated. I can promise you tomorrow if Matt doesn’t mind, but it’ll have to lead toward something else.</p> <p>*</p> <p>I wish I had a friend like Matt. I wish I had friends like my ex's.</p> <p>*</p> <p>If you like this story, please let me know so you can put up with anything else you see fit.</p> <p>Thanks for reading the story and especially your feedback!
