He had a thin covering of blonde hair all over, just enough to cover his penis.</p> <p>The woman was on her knees and had his cock in her mouth.</p> <p>I looked at her for a second, she was still on her knees. Her right hand was stroking his right leg and her left hand was wrapped around his ass. He lifted his left leg up and hooked in her. She had her left arm hooked in the other's. They were locked together as they fucked. His cock was deep in her throat and his hips were slowly rising up and down. He leaned in and kissed her. After a moment they parted and sat back up.</p> <p>She looked over at me, her face flushed, she was breathing hard.</p> <p>Mark had turned back to the screen.</p> <p>The woman had her head bobbing up and down on the stranger's cock.</p> <p>I couldn't move, not that I cared to. I wanted my wife to be happy, she was sucking the stranger's cock in front of me. And, if I made her cum with my cock, then that's my problem. If I kept her going, she'd stop at zero.</p> <p>She sat back up, but her feet were still in my lap, feet spread out wide as a pillow. I was so close I had to hold out, and I did. I held my breath as the head of Mark's cock touched her. I looked at her, and we both smiled again.</p> <p>He leaned in and kissed her with abandon. I thought we'd be locked in our sexual embrace forever, I was sure of it. I felt his cock hit her inner thigh and as far away from me as his cock would allow.</p> <p>She held her breath as she heard him make love to her mouth.</p> <p>He kissed her and then moved back down her body. He kissed her stomach and then worked his way around to her breasts. He kissed her mouth while his hands worked their way slowly down to her legs.</p> <p>"I want you to cum for me," he said softly and I could tell his words were very sincere. It was a command that she knew to make me feel good.</p> <p>She held her breath as his hands moved in to her pussy. It was still wet, but not as wet as her mouth the first time I had made love to her. Her pussy was open and inviting. Her lips were small, with just the lightest touch. Her clit looked bigger that I have ever seen. I could see it peaking out from her hood. It was erect and wet from our talk and it was the kind that you just want to suckle for seconds. Mark began to kiss it. Her legs held his head in place as his tongue flicked her clit.</p> <p>With her pussy in my hands we could both feel her cum now. The first orgasm she had had since we came over was long, powerful, and intense. More than a dozen had been in rapid succession of minutes. She was cumming all over my fingers, her mouth and face were covered in her juices.</p> <p>I was just watching from a chair when I heard her beg for my cock. "Please." "Please." "Please."</p> <p>She kept begging for it, all of it, and finally he said she was ready. I was stunned as I watched him pull his swollen cock away from her wet pussy. He stood up from her body and she quickly jumped from the bed to the door as he put his head in her mouth.</p> <p>I couldn't move. This wasn't me. I wasn't my wife. I looked around, I didn't have much control. She had opened the door to her own apartment to her new lover.</p> <p>Her boyfriend was standing at the door, his hard cock pointing up. He was looking at Mark's face. As Mark had said, he didn't care what he saw. If the camera was fixed I was sure there'd be nothing for anyone to see. And it would appear that someone was watching.</p> <p>"Get on your knees." He held the door. I felt like a child in a porn shoot. I had to wait until she got the chance to go.</p> <p>I felt her legs come away from my thighs and settle at the top of the bed. I sat there, my legs spread as I tried to decide what to do next. I felt a pair of arms pull the robe open and then another pair of hands reach for my cock. Then another.</p> <p>"I need to make sure there are still pictures." My hands left the bed and I walked with Mark to the door.</p> <p>This was our moment.
