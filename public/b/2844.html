And it must have weighed on you because it feels as if my hands are being tickled quite a bit," she quipped as she started to laugh.</p> <p>"That just makes it so much more delicious!" I said, smiling, "And, what's the word "wonderful" in this town?"</p> <p>"Pardon?" she asked, looking puzzled at my accent.</p> <p>"Pardon where?" she asked, "A country name? I have no idea."</p> <p>"Cambria. That's my accent? But now it's a bit thick," I joked, smiling to myself.</p> <p>She laughed along with me for a while, and said that, if I had to guess, she'd like to get to know me better. So, she invited me to stay the night.</p> <p>I laughed to myself and asked, "I like going to places alone to unwind. You can stay with me, of course, if that's agreeable to you."</p> <p>"Oh, it may be a little bit of an inconvenience," she said coyly, not able to put it off.</p> <p>As I drove to my house, I couldn't help noticing that her face was flushed with excitement. She must have felt the electricity in the air from our little exchange of words.</p> <p>I knocked on the door, and it quickly answered. I had noticed that, though she was wearing jeans and a button up shirt, she also had a black leather jacket on that she had zipped up to mid-chest and a short, tight black skirt on.</p> <p>When the door slowly opened, she stepped aside, allowing me room to enter.</p> <p>By the time I had come to the living room, she was standing at the table with a wine glass in her hand. Her dress had a deep low front that left nothing to the imagination, showing off her slim figure. I noticed how her black bra caught the light and it took me a second to notice that she wasn't wearing panties either. I looked from her face to her eyes, and she smiled as if sharing a secret secret.</p> <p>I reached over to her and gently held her hand. She sighed with relief and looked up shyly.</p> <p>"Do you mean it?" she asked, her eyes glistening from her own arousal.</p> <p>"I know. I've never even been with a guy before either," I responded. "Would you care to dance a little with me, to join another of us that's just a little more adventurous with you, maybe?"</p> <p>"That might be possible," she replied. "But not right here."</p> <p>"No, I can't take that chance," I told her. "I would be disappointed if that's not what we're after."</p> <p>We walked out on the dance floor, shaking our hips, and touching each other. I danced as long as I could and we were just enjoying being with each other. When we had danced quite a bit, we sat on the couch, and I leaned back, my arm around her shoulders.</p> <p>"You know that I want to feel you under my hands again," I said, my lips pressing softly together in a seductive smile. "I know you haven't told me what sort of mood you are in, and I'm not sure exactly how to lead you there, but, believe me, you'll do whatever I tell you."</p> <p>"If you like," she replied, her eyes sparkling with anticipation, "I'll go for it."</p> <p>She leaned in to me, her lips pressing softly to mine as we slowly made our way to wherever she was going to take us. We found a place on the couch just as the waitress appeared with our drinks. We drank quickly and began to feel more relaxed. We had done this before, and we liked it, as we had both been a little apprehensive about it the previous night before. We talked about it for a while and then, we kissed. We were just enjoying each other as we hadn't really decided to try anything, let alone what we were going to do ourselves.</p> <p>When the waitress returned with our food and drinks, we were both surprised to see her and we had a few drinks in her. I was pretty buzzed, and we giggled with that.</p> <p>"Do you know what you're up against at this point?" she asked.</p> <p>"What?" I replied, looking down at myself and blushing as I tried to look nonchalant.</p> <p>"Nothing," she said quickly. "Just making sure you are getting the hang of it."</p> <p>"You're blushing," I said, trying to be as casual as possible.</p> <p>"Well," she replied, her face suddenly serious, "I haveâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
