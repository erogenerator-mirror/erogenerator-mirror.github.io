John said with a smile.</p> <p>"Mmmm, that sounds wonderful!" she replied as she stood up. "Let's go inside and have a swim!"</p> <p>"That's an invitation!" John said, and he led her into the master bedroom.</p> <p>He closed the door, and they stood at the foot of the bed with him on one side and her standing at the other. It had a small, comfortable-looking tub with a bench behind it. He looked at her quizzically for a few moments before leaning down and gently kissing her.</p> <p>She responded eagerly and immediately started kissing him back with even more eagerness. As they kissed she reached down and gently took his erection in her hand gently caressing it, caressing her hand along the soft length of it, caressing the head, exploring the opening at the base, sliding her hand further down with each successive kiss. He moaned as she caressed him; he really enjoyed it.</p> <p>She looked up at him, smiled and said, "Go to the bathroom and get out of those trunks that you're wearing. While you're waiting, I'll get changed into something else."</p> <p>"OK. I'll grab my trunks and go," he said, a little unsure.</p> <p>"Good. Because when I get out of the shower, you'll be too."</p> <p>She smiled and got into the water, swishing around it, splashing water upon him as she ran her fingers through the bubbles. That was a feeling he'd never felt before, his body becoming aroused and ready for more!</p> <p>When he walked out of the bathroom, she was sitting on the edge of the tub, in the same position John had been on the night before, and they were both facing toward each other, her on her stomach, him leaning forward, his hardness pressing against her hip.</p> <p>They were both enjoying the moment, enjoying each other's body as they kissed each other tenderly, and feeling his hardness pressing against her hip, her back and shoulders. She began sliding her hand down over his chest to his erection, caressing his cock and enjoying the feel of his body as he moved it back and forth through her fingers as though it were a caressing hand. He slid his hand down her body and caressed her soft, smooth, silky hair as she gently stroked his cock, feeling its heat and hardness as his hand caressed the small of her back.</p> <p>He moved closer behind her as they got closer to the tub, placing his arms around her to hold her from behind. She could feel his hardness pressing against her now, and she raised up on her knees, placing her legs over his. As she did so, he ran his hands up her inner thighs and up over her naked breasts, squeezing them tenderly, and massaging them, occasionally pinching her nipples. His hands slipped down to her belly, and he squeezed and massaged her firm ass as they kissed. He slid his hand down between them, and was thrilled by the feel of her wetness all over his fingers as he rubbed her clitoris through the soft skin of her mound. She moaned in pleasure as he slid his fingers over what he had been trying to hide for so long. She pushed back, wanting more of him to enter her.</p> <p>"Oh, that feels so good," she said. "Make me come!"</p> <p>As though she had anticipated that, and perhaps for the first time ever, this morning, this moment, she felt so desirable and desired. And she could feel the excitement of the moment moving towards her own orgasm, and she wanted to make the most of it. She raised herself up to one elbow and gazed into the deep blue eyes of John as their mouths locked together, his tongue sliding past her lips. She wanted him now, and felt his cock pressing against her belly now.</p> <p>"Oh! Yes! Now!" she cried as she felt him move his mouth back to hers, and their kissing increased in intensity as she lifted herself up to press her pussy down hard upon his hardness. "I need to come!" She cried once. Then, she dropped back down upon him.</p> <p>The first time she had taken his cock into her mouth, she had taken him into her throat, and she'd always enjoyed swallowing. John let her work for a moment, reveling in the feel of her wet mouth against his dick as she did to John's, then he rolled her onto her belly.</p> <p>"Let me do this," he said. He pulled his cock away from her body until the swollen head was barely inside her.</p> <p>"That's not going to be necessary," she said breathlessly. "Now put it in!"</p> <p>She reached back for his cock, stroking him softly, feeling him penetrate her as she slid her hand up against his body, then gentlyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
