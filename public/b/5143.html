She drank the entire of it in like a shot. She was so warm, and I could feel her body tremble with every sip of the hot coffee. "You were a hot sight!" I chuckled as I pulled her into my arms, kissing her and rubbing her hands through my hair as we both sat there sipping our hot coffee. I felt so silly, I felt so embarrassed, I felt like I was going to explode... I was drunk. I wanted to jump out of my skin and run like crazy.</p> <p>Samantha was about to tell me to stop and when I didn't, she grabbed my head and pushed it down. I had to fight from doing something other than simply taking a sip of my hot coffee. I don't think she realized what she did, or even cared. She just pulled me toward her and rubbed her lips against mine. I could feel her hand on my thigh, and I pushed my body into hers, feeling her soft and warm body rub against mine. I felt her nipples hard against me, and I could feel the wetness between my legs... I looked into her eyes as she pulled her mouth away from mine, and I felt my heart pound so hard... it seemed to hurt just a little. Then my mouth met hers again, feeling my passion rising even higher. I felt her tongue push against my own, and our soft lips pressed together.</p> <p>"Sam, I want you!" she gasped, and I felt like the luckiest man on the planet.</p> <p>"Honey, I'm not. I wanted this. I really want to."</p> <p>"Oh Sam, I'm so excited... I can't wait any longer, you need to stop, it's killing me inside... make love to me, you need to, you need to. Sam, kiss me please"</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>I pulled her lips to mine again, and I slid my hands up her legs and around her waist, holding her body against me. Samantha had me so completely enthralled I hadn't even had time to wonder why I'd never been with a woman before, or why the idea had never come along. Here I was, doing this right... it felt... so right, but I still knew not to push it, too... no, to push it.</p> <p>I felt her hand slowly slide up my leg as we were continuing to french one another, and I began to press our bodies into one another.</p> <p>"Samantha... I've missed being with you..."</p> <p>"You have been missing me... I was afraid you'd been disappointed with me, until you got a look into my eyes... I love you Sam, I love you more than anyone else on this Earth."</p> <p>I felt how strong her right leg was pressing against mine, the softness of her thigh felt so warm to me, and it felt so good, I felt like a man, and I didn't care. Nothing mattered except for what we were doing.</p> <p>"Mmmm, I love you Sam."</p> <p>"Hmmm.. you do too, sweetheart, it's been so long."</p> <p>She placed her hand on the back of my head and pushed my lips to hers again. I felt her tongue slid into my mouth, caressing my own, she tasted good as usual. As soon as I felt the warmth of our kissing, she slid her tongue into my mouth. I felt my own tongue and mouth, touching one another, entwining and exploring, our soft lips and tongues. When she felt my tongue slide into her mouth, she wrapped her small hands around my neck and pushed me down until I was lying next to her. She pressed her body against mine, and I took the chance to slide my hand down to her thigh.</p> <p>I took my hand from her leg and ran it up her body, feeling the wetness of her panties, I slid my hand around to find out what she was wearing under her robe, and I found out why when I felt the thin strap of her bra, I almost passed out. The feel of her body against mine, and the sensation of her breath on my lips made me throb, and once again her eyes widened in surprise.. She had an intense look on her face; I wondered if she was seeing this whole scene in a sexual way... It was an erotic thing for both of us.</p> <p>I slipped my hand down her body and grabbed her other breast. I held her tightly against my body as I rolled her nipple between my thumb and forefinger. Her skin was so soft and warm, and I ran my other hand lovingly over her breast as I gently squeezed and caressed her breast, feeling that incredible tingling in her body, and it was driving me mad.
