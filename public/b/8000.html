"</p> <p>"Yes it would."</p> <p>"Good; can we start off with a nice lunch and then maybe do some dancing?"</p> <p>"Well I have a little dance for you then that is why I am meeting you here."</p> <p>She led him to the kitchen where her purse was there and he saw that it was very feminine looking. He thought she could have been as pretty as her mom, and if she wasn't so innocent. She walked him into the room where the CD player was, and then turned to sit him down and she sat him down on a chair so his back was against it. She kissed him and then got down between his legs and licked his balls and then his cock and then gave him a slow wet blowjob. She licked his cock from the base to the tip and she could feel him getting harder, and she would also like to hold him in her mouth and stroke up and down.</p> <p>"Do you have any wine, can you get one? "</p> <p>"Ah, some wine, I got this wine, will you help me?" he offered.</p> <p>"Yes, of course! But you may need the larder."</p> <p>He helped her, he knew he had to keep some of the wine for herself, not the men's, it could wait until after the meal. As he was helping her he thought about what she was doing and then asked, "Can you give me the wine here?"</p> <p>"No, you might need to loosen your dress or you are going to look funny, and I've got to be the one to loosen your dress."</p> <p>"Oh no, go ahead, it's not that, and it would not look any worse for wear, the only reason I did it is because I didn't like people seeing me with a wedding veil."</p> <p>"Oh really, I don't mind," he replied and he put his hand on her hip and took her wine glass and took a sip.</p> <p>"I'm not sure, do you have a preference, other than for me not to see you doing things." he asked as he handed her a glass.</p> <p>"Well I think we should just have to go with the flow, like I do with you," she replied as she took his hand and slid it up her leg until the tips of his fingers had touched her pussy and then rubbed up across her labia and to her clit.</p> <p>His finger slipped easily into her vagina and she let out a small moan as she felt his finger penetrate her and her clit began to swell. His finger was working her slowly in the same manner that he had his cock. He knew that she would be ready so he leaned back on the chair and removed his fingers and then she felt his warm hand on her and then his cock slid into her cunt. That made her moan even louder and she pushed her pelvis toward his cock and pushed.</p> <p>"That's the way; do you like it, do you like it do you want to feel more of it?"</p> <p>"OH God...yes...it feels so good to feel you. Oh, God...Yes." She managed to get out a few words as he was thrusting in and out of her.</p> <p>"What do you say we take a shower first, and then we can have something to talk about?"</p> <p>"Well, I think it's time to get our clothes on before we have to do anything else," she replied and helped him to their clothes.</p> <p>When they were both dressed, he took her hand and they walked back out to his car. As he was driving away from the restaurant and down the street, he saw that he heard a woman's voice.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, we are still a little long for you. But your husband's already gone, so it seems you can go and take a walk now."</p> <p>"Oh, no, I wouldn't be able to walk without your help then, would you give me a lift?" she responded and then said, "Would you help me up to the house?"</p> <p>"Are you sure?" He smiled, and then as he was driving around the neighborhood he noticed her legs and they were wobbly as she walked by. He wondered just what she had in her mind.</p> <p>She got up to the house and she saw him standing there, looking the way she had just walked by.
