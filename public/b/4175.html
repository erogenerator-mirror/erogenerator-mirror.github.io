"A great dinner!"</p> <p>And they went to their room to put on their clothes.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>I was just finishing up my morning routine when Sara came in. She looked like a little kid who hadn't seen a thing of her father, including the towel she had on. Then she noticed the way she was dressed and said, "Dad I'm starving!"</p> <p>I smiled and said, "Good, because I know it will be a very good dinner anyway, and if I didn't come home for dinner, I'd probably blow my load into my clothes!"</p> <p>She just stared at me for a moment and then said, "Well, if that is ok, and I don't mind if you have dinner, then I'll just cook right back up, ok? I didn't know how much time we had, but I sure can do this."</p> <p>I nodded in agreement. I knew it would be really good food, and I wanted one very, very badly. That's why I had set up the reservation.</p> <p>As I closed the door to her apartment door, I said, "Wow, you look great, honey!"</p> <p>Sara looked up in surprise and said, "Hey, thank you." Then she smiled, and kissed me.</p> <p>She said she had a small bowl of ice cream (which I had given her at the restaurant,) and brought it over to the table. She took the bowl of ice cream to the table right in front of me and gave me a little hug when she saw my reaction, and said, "Thank you very much, dad." Then she turned to go back to her apartment, and I said, "I didn't know you were here. I'd hate to have to give you up for dinner."</p> <p>"Oh no," Sara giggled, "You're here to be daddy's girl. And I love it! Of course I'll do anything you ask me for dinner. It is very important that I have my own place, and to have that, you know, be my lover after you're home."</p> <p>I thought, "Wow! That would be awesome! Oh, how much I love it!" I'm pretty sure I was blushing when I said that to her. It was kind of sudden, but the way I did it would make any man jealous, of course.</p> <p>She said she was so happy to be a mother to both of us. And was thinking, "Well, I'm going to be mom, and she wants to be me."</p> <p>But then she took her time to explain. Her mother would be very strict with her, and she'd get a lot more sexual attention than a normal mother would. And I mean that literally in a very, very good way.</p> <p>"I feel bad," she said, "not wanting any part of me in their lives, or doing anything. But I know how much you like them, and would love to please you. I know, of course. But there's no need for you to be jealous to my mother. She just feels bad about being with a guy who might be anally attracted to me."</p> <p>So she went on to talk about how she would treat a man by the next day about wanting to give her his wife, so that she could have her own place.</p> <p>But before she went on, I had to admit that I felt somewhat relieved that she hadn't had to say any of the other men's names, or their ages, that she had to have said. But since her being with a guy was one of the hottest things about her, it was kind of an extra. And also, because she had done it with me, as far back as she could remember, and didn't just call me dad because she didn't like the idea of him being with a guy her own age. She had to tell me that it was one of the hottest things about it. It had been fun and I was really glad to get it from her. And also, it made it so I wasn't going out with other guys, of course. I knew it would just mean more times with her, and more things for both of us.</p> <p>And I thought, I don't think I could live with that. No, I couldn't. I couldn't let her do this to me. She shouldn't be doing this with a guy her own age. But I couldn't do that.</p> <p>I had to go for it. "Sara," I said, "please, we need to be very clear about this, and we both know this goes on. It's really no big deal. I mean, we're just doing this to let you feel good. We have to feel good too. It's really not that I would turn you loose, if you want me to."</p> <p>But then she hesitated for a moment, and saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
