"No, I have never taken a shower with my wife and it has never been more comfortable to me even when I'm in this mood and it isn't so strange having your wife's fingers in my pants, at least," I explained. "As long as that's the whole deal, we'll be ok."</p> <p>I'd always heard in my mind a very private place where I could have had a conversation if I ever got to feel a tongue in me or my balls.</p> <p>"So, have you ever had a good one?" I asked.</p> <p>"Not quite," she replied, not moving from her kneeling position. "But you might learn everything there is to know about pleasure," she said, taking her time looking up at me, "and I'll definitely enjoy giving it," she went on. "But to make it up to you, I'd much rather give you a nice hand job than my husband's, so you can get the hand job."</p> <p>"I don't know," I muttered, feeling my own dick twitch against the seat and getting a little uncomfortable. "I was just thinking that maybe, if she keeps on doing what she's doing right now, you can watch me and maybe finish the job as well," I said. "That should get you to relax, and just enjoy the situation."</p> <p>She was silent for a bit, and then began to do something, sliding a finger up and down between my balls and then over my shaft to the head of my dick. "Feel better now?" she asked me.</p> <p>"Definitely," I smiled. "And to make sure, I want you to come in my mouth!" I told her.</p> <p>"Yeah, I know what you mean!" she laughed. "But now I'm going to need to get my hands dirty," she said and reached for her purse. She returned with a pair of long and narrow whippy black heels - "that's how women use them - a short little heel."</p> <p>"What?" I said, a little confused.</p> <p>"Well, if I say I want to lick your panties to, and I don't believe that I meant to, you have to let go of them so I can lick you, or suck you, and make a baby," she explained, moving her fingers to the crotch of her panties which were a dark color, which would probably show on the crotch, "or even go all the way up," she said, opening one of the snaps. "So, if..." she continued, "you put your hand under my skirt, and start to stroke me. After a few strokes with your fingers, you can go ahead and put your mouth on me. You can take my panties aside, and lick me - or maybe just start sucking me. When I'm ready to come, you can stop and let me have a good mouthful, and finish with a good hand job," she said. To this, I could tell she had to be kidding, but I wanted to let myself go, so I did. "Wow," I exhaled. "You could be serious!"</p> <p>"And when I want, can I help out?" she winked. "I know your wife has an oral fetish."</p> <p>I wondered if she'd picked up on this, and she went on. "But only just. I don't think I'll be doing that - I mean, it's not like she'd have a great deal of control with you watching. She's only doing it because you like her doing it, and she loves to do it," I confessed.</p> <p>"What's wrong with it when you say that?" she asked, looking at me.</p> <p>"Well, for a start, if it will make you feel better," I said, "we aren't in a relationship so I don't want some guy getting off on the wrong way, or having his dick pulled."</p> <p>"Oh, don't worry, I won't do it if you won't!" she laughed. "But I know my wife would, and if you wanted to do this, I'd tell her it was ok, you know, or just pretend it's what other guys get off about - you know, suck."</p> <p>So, I felt like I was in some kind of dilemma. Was it up to me to make her do this? After all, I thought. I asked what she liked, and she said 'it's something to do with me - it's just sex,' and then she asked if I had a friend who would like to watch her. She said it was ok if she and my friend didn't have any friends in the world, and she'd love to see me licking someone else's pussy. Then we agreed that if herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
