'There's a lot of stuff I don't know about. If you ever change your mind, just let me know, the next time. And the next time, please,' she added with confidence. They both knew that was all she was going to say. Her mind had been focused on him all night. And despite her words of reassurance that she would never let go.</p> <p>'I won't say anything. I promise,' he said, a little more confidently, the smile fading slowly from his face, even in the semi-darkness.</p> <p>'Thank you,' she whispered, taking his hand in hers. 'And I'll stay with you.' She smiled inwardly. There was one thing that she absolutely loved about him, which was not the love itself, but just the total trust she felt for him, especially once they got to know each other again after that night. Sure, she just didn't know what the hell he had planned for his future, but what harm had he intended doing with his life with her. She didn't need any more of that confidence now that she was his.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Diana turned down the hallway toward the bedroom she and her boyfriend shared in a quiet and detached way, her gaze never once leaving the door to her bedroom. She had no idea what was going on as she walked upstairs, her imagination, whatever it was, was not going to tell her. She'd have to wait a little while and figure it out. She looked into the large mirror inside the door and studied her reflection, but there was something else wrong with her face - it was as if her eyes had lost the color of her eyebrows, instead they looked white and white, like were just holding her in.</p> <p>Her eyes had a lot more colour than she had when she was young. The color had lost its grip. She knew that she didn't need to apply makeup for her face. And she'd never worn makeup, since she didn't have the time. And with her in her forties now, her face had looked even more sophisticated as she dressed up for the evening, but she really didn't feel used now. There was just something so sexy about the way she was dressed, looking like that. Looking back to her reflection in the mirror, there was just something wrong.</p> <p>And just as she was about to turn the doorknob and enter her bedroom, she heard the sound of voices.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>'So, um, who's the guy?' asked Harry, sitting up in his double bed in his room after his shower. He had just emerged from his own bathroom and saw the pair of legs of the man sitting in his bed. He turned around and saw that not all of the covers were back, only that they were back on the other side. It was only just after midnight. He turned to his side and looked into the mirror and saw a pretty face, a pretty body. There had been some more make-up on the side of her face, not his... she didn't had any on either. She was certainly different in a lot of ways. She had more make-up on her face now. Her hair was much darker than earlier in the evening. Her body was all natural. She had on very little makeup. She looked like a pretty schoolgirl, not a boy.</p> <p>'Mmm, don't worry. The guy's my boyfriend. He's got a great body. You'd love him like that. The two of them have been talking for a while now. I've been watching them.'</p> <p>Harry turned around and looked right at Emily. The handsome, young man's eyes had an odd fascination with her. She wasn't wearing much makeup, at least with Harry. She looked as though she had just stepped out of a Victoria's Secret catalogue, or was it a lingerie catalogue? She wasn't wearing any panties either, a pretty pink one.</p> <p>And then he realized that she was not wearing any underthings either. She hadn't even done a half-assed search. He had been staring at her for a while now, his eyes roaming up and down her body, and he knew that her bra and panties were hidden by that little patch between her legs. He didn't think about the fact that he was looking at his fiancée lying down in front of him. His cock had gone up and down as he did it in the shower or on the floor when the water of the shower got warm. He didn't think about the fact that he was naked and couldn't see her breasts or ass. He couldn't see anything.</p> <p>'Okay,' said Harry, turning back around to face her again, 'It's time.'</p> <p>'Why... wait...,' she looked at herself. The girl was wearing black lace lingerie and a bra, and her body was covered by it.
