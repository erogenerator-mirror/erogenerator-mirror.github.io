As she looked at it, the paper flashed in her eyes, read and her mouth fell open.</p> <p>Dahlia looked at the page, read it and felt her stomach drop as she sat still. The entire page was printed from a blue hand-lever and in ink, on the back was a heart with a blue heart. She could hear Dahlia's heart beating and her eyes flitting back and forth looking at the handwriting of the paper. Her hand went to her lips, held it out, closed it and shook with the force of the shock of it. For a second, she thought of Dahlia, lost in thought of her life since losing Dahlia.</p> <p>When it went through her eyes and into her mind, Dahlia felt it, felt her blood rush and the tears begin to flow. She held it out to Dahlia and let herself cry. Dahlia wanted to do the same. She opened her arms and embraced Dahlia. Dahlia could feel tears on the back of her hand and some dripping down her cheek.</p> <p>They cried there for several minutes and then Dahlia wiped their tears away. "That paper is a gift," she said softly and kissed Dahlia's cheek. Both of them went to sit on the bed and cried again, this time with their arms wrapped about each other.</p> <p>A few minutes later, they had finished their tears and were standing before a mirror. Dahlia had tears in her eyes as she held Dahlia's face in her hands. Dahlia was wearing a black gown and her face looked beautiful, as she looked at herself. Dahlia stood before Dahlia, cupping her face in her hands and holding the softness of her cheek in both of her hands. Dahlia turned to face her and hugged her lovingly. She began to cry again and was ashamed of herself that she cried.</p> <p>"I have never been this sad." Dahlia said softly as she sobbed, the emotion pouring out of her. She leaned her face down to Dahlia's and touched it. She looked into her eyes. "Dahlia, I have never been this sad," Dahlia whispered. "I'm not sure I know how to describe it so that's not important."</p> <p>"I was looking into your eyes the whole time. I had to take a chance and let my emotions run the course they're supposed to with the rest of my life."</p> <p>"Do we really have to get this on paper. The pain and terror I feel is nothing compared to the joy you have in your heart for being with me. I can tell it can become scary."</p> <p>"I love you and if you were me, I would do this for you."</p> <p>Dahlia held Dahlia as they sat on the bed, hugging all over. She felt like she could hold on to the light for eternity, letting drop the fear and dread that was so hard to face. She leaned down and kissed Dahlia's forehead.</p> <p>"I will not let anything bad happen to you," Dahlia said softly as she rubbed her cheek. "I will take your heart and your grief on my hand and on the world in general."</p> <p>"What about the love? The hate?"</p> <p>"No, love."</p> <p>Dahlia began crying again as she rubbed her face all over Dahlia's cheek and down her neck. It wasn't long before she let herself cry herself. Dahlia felt so happy and contented as she hugged and held Dahlia. She could feel tears on her cheek as she began to cry, her fingers going in and out of her hair. Dahlia couldn't understand what was happening to her, she thought that happiness was in her soul.</p> <p>Dahlia's other hand had come to rest on Dahlia's hip and she felt skin against skin. It didn't feel real, it felt hollow and cold and Dahlia held Dahlia tighter. She was sure that she felt skin on skin and something else was coming. Then she felt fingers touching her thigh, felt fingers pushing on her vagina. It didn't feel real, but it felt real as Dahlia began to cry harder. "I can feel it!"</p> <p>Dahlia jumped in surprise as she realized both of her legs were open to allow more access. So did the fingers that were pushing on her vagina.</p> <p>"Dahlia..."</p> <p>"Shhh," she interrupted and turned her face so she was looking at Dahlia's smiling eyes. Dahlia watched as she began to play with Dahlia's vagina, feeling her vaginal lips becoming more and more aroused to see the fingers doing what they were doing to her. She began to rub her vulva in a most erotic and sensuous way, trying not to react while doing it.</p> <p>"Dahlia, I think..."</p> <p>She let Dahlia continue to rub herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
