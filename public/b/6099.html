His fingers danced with her as they shared such a tender moment. The fire inside her was so hot and alive. She felt her legs wrap around him as his body pressed against hers. He held her against him, her head on his shoulder, and his arms wrapped tightly around her as he tried to get as much of her back in his pants as he could. He moaned in pleasure when, without warning, she pushed him onto his back and straddled him where she knelt in front of him and began to undo his pants. He raised his hips to meet and encourage her movement as she unfastened them. He smiled to himself in wonder at her excitement at this.</p> <p>“Please sir, may I have your cum in my mouth? I can’t wait for yours to taste.”</p> <p>“Shhh, my little slave, I’m not done with you yet.”</p> <p>The sound of his voice sent a wave of electricity straight through her as she swallowed his cock to the base. They stayed that way until her head finally came up and they kissed passionately.</p> <p>“Thank you Sir,” she said, pulling her mouth from his, almost like she was afraid he would try to stop her.</p> <p>But what she felt was such a combination of tenderness and lust and she melted into him. With the love in her deep blue eyes, she kissed him with a passion she knew only she could feel and she wanted more. She straddled him with ease and sat back, taking the shaft of his cock deep in her body.</p> <p>“Now, Sir, would it be alright if I sat on you, as you are?”</p> <p>“Yes, it is my wish to feel my slave for the duration of our time together.”</p> <p>“Yes Sir,” she said as she moved down, looking back into his eyes as she settled her body on his. His hands were on her hips and she felt the heat of his body below her skin. As they kissed, her tongue moved along his lower lip and she felt his breath quicken as they started to move together in gentle motions. His strong hands were on her waist and she moved back. His kiss was harder, his tongue more demanding as he took possession of her mouth with his.</p> <p>She was moaning softly now, and he could feel the heat and urgency, the need deep in her body as well as his. “Please Sir, please take me now.”</p> <p>“How could I refuse such a request, as my slave,” he said, reaching down to stroke the silky hair of her head. The sound of his voice thrilled her.</p> <p>She knew he expected this too, so she moved down off of him and lay back, the head of his cock now within her. She raised her knees; spreading her thighs as they met hers. Their bodies were pressed together now in a most familiar way of their joining. She opened her eyes as she felt the head of his cock touch her skin. She moved her hips to let him slip inside of her and she moaned as she felt him deep within her.</p> <p>“Oh,” she moaned again.</p> <p>She lifted her legs back, opening herself to him as she did it this time. Her hands were on his shoulders for support and he held her with his hands on her breasts. He began to move inside of her, slowly at first, but slowly building his pace until they were both in the mood to get wild. His hands played with her nipples, and she moved with him, feeling his weight and the heat from him.</p> <p>“Please Sir, I want you to fill me with your cum, please, please, please,” she moaned.</p> <p>“You’re not to cum, even when I’m inside you, and you may not move without my permission.”</p> <p>Her legs wrapped around him and she felt something touch her anus. Then she felt and felt a strange pain as his fingers entered her. He was moving his fingers in her as she lifted her hips to meet them. She felt the hot fluid run into her. She moaned like she was in pain but that she didn’t, instead feeling so aroused as she felt he begin to fuck her. She felt him pull away and hold onto her breasts and she raised her hips up, meeting his rhythm. She felt her body tense as though she could cum at any moment.</p> <p>The pain that she felt was gone, replaced by a pleasure.
