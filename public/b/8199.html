I asked. My voice was small, soft and soft now but filled with worry.</p> <p>"Yeah," she said. "I'm not going on vacation for three weeks." She sighed. "I just need some time to myself. I'm taking a vacation. With you. I've missed that." She grabbed my hand and led me up the stairs.</p> <p>"Where am I taking you?" I asked. She giggled and I felt guilty.</p> <p>"We don't have to go anywhere if you don't like it," she replied. "I got you a ride in a car from the next street. I wanted to stop for something to eat and to get away from the sun. I know you have never been to this place, and I wanted to see you."</p> <p>I smiled at the thought that she might not have a car but that if she had one I would just want to see it.</p> <p>I followed her out the door but didn't let go of her hand. "How did you know I had to take you?" I asked.</p> <p>"You know," she laughed. I was still holding her hand to show it were okay. A woman should never do that to me but she did. "I saw you walking downstairs, and when I followed you up the stairs that's when I saw you."</p> <p>"That's strange," I said. "I don't know you?" I asked.</p> <p>"A friend told me that you might like it there," she said. "She told me we should take a vacation." I smiled. She had a good sense of humor and I liked her to smile.</p> <p>We climbed the stairs to a loft that had air conditioning, plus it was a family-style loft with a Jacuzzi.</p> <p>"I guess I'm going to have to change out of these clothes," I joked.</p> <p>"Oh you're not," she said with a smile.</p> <p>We climbed the stairs two at a time and had to move a couple of inches away from each other at the bottom. There was enough room in the room for one of our queen-sized bed seats. It was the perfect place for a relaxed day and my body got a little hard when she walked over to it. When she laid down on top of the bed she kissed me. It was a sensual kiss, and her smile gave me an instant erection and I was glad we weren't going to go to a bathroom right away.</p> <p>We spent the next couple of hours having our little fun on the beach. We started out the night by fooling around in the water and in several different positions. Once the sun got off we fell into each others arms and we fell asleep in each others arms, but not in the chair where we had to sit next to each other on the far side of the bed. We woke about five in the morning when the sun came through the windows, and our bodies were covered with kisses.</p> <p>The next day we had breakfast at the hotel buffet breakfast with plenty of food. We didn't waste any of that time getting to know each other. We spent the day flirting with each other on the beach and making love in the hot sun. That afternoon we were dancing in the casino at the casino. Then when we got to the hotel, we went up the elevator and went to our room. We made love in the hotel room and in the bedroom and then the bedroom. It was a passionate, soulful, mind-blowing, romantic love making. Afterward we made love again in our bed and the next morning it was just pillow talk with kissing and sweet making love.</p> <p>It wasn't really an endearment but one that I found surprising. We have never been too much of an item, but we still talked and we talked and we talked and we talked, and that kept our lust satisfied.</p> <p>We found a romantic, romantic hotel and stayed there on the beach. It was a nice vacation for me and the two of us and we went back to our room and took a shower together. We got dressed in our towels and went downstairs to have a light breakfast. Since we were at least partly in the room everyone in the house was naked, and our hosts didn't seem to mind we brought a spare towel. It was a warm, sunny day so we put on some of our normal clothes and then went to do a little shopping. We finished in the clothes department in a manner very similar to all the other shopping stores in town.</p> <p>We went to breakfast in bed again and got some clothes of our own again. We bought a lot of lingerie for the trip and we bought a bunch of things for the trip that wasn't so much for me. We had a little fun buying the items and they made things for us.</p> <p>We got home with nothing onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
