I asked, trying to sound as if I were just about to cry.</p> <p>"I got you here. You're new at my party, too." He laughed, "That's the thing, I'm gay! I mean, you're not like most women at my party, I just don't get it."</p> <p>"I'm not," I said, "and as I've said before, I haven't done anything to suggest that that's all."</p> <p>"Yeah, right," he said, waving his hands wildly. "I was just talking about myself: how you feel, what you want, what you want, and how it feels. Now, are you ready, or did I interrupt something important?" I looked at him, trying to take in his features, failing miserably, but just staring at him. "I just heard you say that you liked 'being' gay, which has that same connection to us all."</p> <p>"But I thought you didn't want me to be gay, too?" I asked.</p> <p>"I don't have that kind of relationship," he said. "I'm a straight guy. I just never went out with anyone on a date. And you were the object of my interest. And when you're in the mood, you make me happy."</p> <p>"It wasn't anything sexual," I protested. "It was just an open, straight talk. I don't want you to think that I'm anything but straight."</p> <p>"I don't think you are, either. Just remember me saying that I don't care about what you do in the way of sex, or what you taste like. I don't do that, because I don't know you and neither do you. My sex, for me, is purely sexual, and it's all about how I feel, and how I like it. I get turned on about other women tasting their own juices; I get aroused by the feel of another one's pussy, but I don't have that kind of relationship with other women. I want sex from someone that feels like I do. I'm not into men."</p> <p>"I guess you're straight," I told him. "There's just something about how you talk about us, and that about us, that makes people feel better."</p> <p>"Look, you're right," he said, "I don't really go around being one of the guys here. That's just what I do. If I felt like that, I'd go down on you and maybe have an encounter. But it's the other way around, too. Even if I had a little taste, I wouldn't do it. I just don't have a thing for kissing or anything like that. It's not natural. I'm from another country, a little bit weird." He stopped, and stared at me.</p> <p>"I can kiss and you can't," I said, trying to ignore the fact that there was a part of me that wanted to. "I don't want to suck on your penis, either."</p> <p>"It's okay, there," he assured me. "I am a man, after all. We're not going to kiss. Let's just get some food first, then go to my room."</p> <p>He picked at some paper and then started to open a pack. "You don't seem very hung up on me," he said.</p> <p>"I'm not," I corrected.</p> <p>"You want me to," he said.</p> <p>"No," I assured him. "I don't."</p> <p>We ate, and then I finished the rest of my food and started up the stairs to my room. When he opened the door to my room, he gave me a surprised look.</p> <p>"You're serious," he said.</p> <p>"I really am. I'm sure that some people do things like that, but I don't ever talk about it with anyone. It must be pretty strange."</p> <p>"But it's okay, you know. A pretty good explanation."</p> <p>"Maybe. I am weird, isn't it, and I don't want you to feel weird. I do know you don't like being my lover and sex partner, but you're not obligated to tell me, nor think you do, and I certainly do not want that. Don't you want me to do it because you do want it, too?"</p> <p>"It's not that," I assured him. "I just don't know if I'm really bi, or if it just comes naturally for men, because you feel the same. You don't always kiss me, though."</p> <p>"It was natural for me to kiss you," he said. "What would it take to make you feel comfortable, instead of just going on being gay? If not for the part, then I'd probably feel more comfortable if anyone was on the island doingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
