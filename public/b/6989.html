"I love you, my darling. I want to do it again with you next time. So, tell me you love me."</p> <p>"I love you a lot, Tracy, you wonderful lover," I said. "And, oh, I love you, too."</p> <p>We kissed and cuddled some more, enjoying our time together. It was almost three and we finally fell into a comfortable peaceful sleep, our loving being the only thing going on. I was awakened by Tracey in bed snuggled up to me, her face close to mine and my arm draped over her bare breast.</p> <p>"What time am I getting out of bed?" I asked, breaking for a kiss.</p> <p>"Soon, my sweet lover."</p> <p>"I should go make some coffee," I said reluctantly. "The day is still young. Then, I'll take my shower and we can enjoy the rest of the day together."</p> <p>I turned to Tracey. "Tracy," I said, "I really have missed you. The way your husband treated me last night was so romantic and wonderful. The way you kissed and caressed me last night was, well, fantastic." My hands and fingers wandered all over her body, feeling her ass cheeks in my hands as I did so. She leaned back against my chest and I slipped my hands down her body and up again, caressing her bare breasts. "I really must say this," I said, "because, well, I'm sure you're pretty turned on right now. Why don't you turn over now so I can really enjoy this beautiful young girl with me?"</p> <p>"You're a man of a while, Michael," Tracey said. "But, maybe, we'd better give ourselves more time before we go out for breakfast."</p> <p>I nodded. "You're damn right we will," I said and pulled her to me, kissing her lips and then her breasts. She giggled and reached behind her to grab my cock and start stroking it as she kissed me. I spread my legs and she leaned back again, her pussy just over the head of Mike's cock.</p> <p>"Just do it," she said and I reached down between Tracey's body and Mike. As she started sliding her pussy up and down Mike's cock, her fingers found my balls and rubbed them. I leaned into her and Tracey put her hand on my chest and kissed me again as Mike slid his cock almost all the way into Tracey's pussy. The feeling was fantastic and Tracey smiled to herself. It looked like Mike was filling her completely.</p> <p>Tracey leaned back and Mike grabbed the headboard with both hands and started pounding into her with hard, fast strokes. Tracey got her knees up over my thighs and put her thighs on Mike's buttocks as he fucked her, her arms around me, and our heads together over my shoulder. I loved looking into Tracey's eyes as she got fucked and feeling her pussy clasping and releasing Mike's cock as he pumped it made my orgasm coming to completion even more intense than before. Tracey came first and then Mike and his body tensed.</p> <p>Mike's cock started spurting thick white liquid into Tracey's pussy as I held still with Mike behind me thrusting into me. Tracey continued to cum as Mike continued to pump into her, his fingers still working her clitoris as he emptied himself into her. Tracey's breasts swung freely as her orgasms calmed and her pussy muscles contracted, milking the cum from Mike's cock. I could tell that he was almost finished and I leaned forward and kissed her lips and mouth. Tracey smiled as we kissed.</p> <p>At least the sex was over, I thought and then Tracey said, "Michael?"</p> <p>"Yes?" I said, knowing she wanted to say goodbye.</p> <p>"What I want to tell you ... is if Tracey ever makes love to you again, I'm not sorry."</p> <p>I paused. "Oh, God, are you kidding me? That little trick you and Mike did, how come you're not apologizing now? Or is she making love to you so much you're not even tempted anymore?"</p> <p>Tracy laughed. "You make me so horny that I want to jump your bones. Then, I'll tell you everything I do and how it makes me feel."</p> <p>"You're teasing me," I said. "But, yes, I am. How about making love to us two for breakfast next Sunday morning?"</p> <p>Tracey laughed again. "You're all-too-familiar with everything I'm doing to Mike. I'm doing what you do to him," she said as she pulled me into her. "I'm just teasing you, darling."</p> <p>After Traceyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
