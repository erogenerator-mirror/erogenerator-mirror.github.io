I know it's not true but it's the truth. I was so much in love with Mary that I can't stop thinking about her. As I write this I see myself as a person not a sexual being, and not Mary. I wonder what she thinks of me. Would Mary think I was a closet lesbian?</p> <p>I have written a very short story about the way I was able to do this and how it made me want women. I think it is the most erotic thing I know. It was the first time I ever wrote about a bisexual experience in my life. I was a very shy one and was afraid about getting in serious a relationship with a woman. I was also a virgin and was afraid of telling my parents about me. I thought that they would see me as a total disappointment. That makes me an awesome woman.</p> <p>I am also writing this as a new experience for me. I write about my experience with a man, as long separated from my experiences with a woman, where a woman has sex with a man. I write about how the man's sexual experience is unique and different to a woman's.</p> <p>This is a new experience for me, as I write of my sexuality. I never knew this was going to happen. I am afraid of losing control on how I am being perceived. Maybe it is wrong, but I am afraid of what will happen if I do something wrong. It's okay if you don't like me, if it is just wrong for you to be in love with a woman. I can't give myself the choice of feelings if I don't want to. I never thought I could be in love with a woman, but I am. It's okay if you don't like it. I just don't want to. I guess if I really want to love a woman and it's okay. It's okay if I like sex, or being sexually aroused by another woman. The woman I love is my own. You don't change that. Is it really okay if you want to learn to be sexual with another woman?</p> <p>If you want to know what a man and a woman would feel like right now, you need to read the rest of this story and see how you feel about this part.</p> <p>I hope you enjoy my first story. Please send comments and votes, as I will do them gladlyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
