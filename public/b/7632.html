She puts her arms around my waist and I wrap them around her neck. We giggle and she continues to run her hands over my back and shoulders before lowering her face to kiss my neck. As our lips meet she pushes her tongue into my mouth and we kiss each other like the two lovebirds that they are. Her hands move down my arms to the buttons on my shirt and they easily untuck it from my body. The two of us stare at the sight, and I could look down to see her hands at work.</p> <p>"Is this just going to be some sort of punishment for me?" she asks, "or is it going to be your usual goodnight kiss?"</p> <p>"Oh no," I say, "that's not why I said you could pick the kiss."</p> <p>"What kind of kiss?" I say with a chuckle.</p> <p>"Oh, you know," she says, "a kiss like that has been in the past..." her eyes begin to travel around and over to my shirt, "that makes two of us."</p> <p>"You know I love that," I say again, "but I'm not complaining either." Her hands start unbuttoning my shirt, and I close my eyes. The moment she's done my buttons, she puts her hand over mine and pulls my shirt out from under my shirt. We stare at each other, and she pushes her finger between my upper chest and my stomach until it cups my bare skin. Her fingers come to my belt and she starts unbuttoning it while we kiss. Our kiss becomes more intense as we both sense that our love for each other, and as we stare one another in the eye, she slowly unzips my jeans. The zipper catches my eyes in the reflection, and it's only then that I realize that our bodies are pressing together. Our hands are at work, and we kiss as their warm bodies rub against skin.</p> <p>Without breaking our kiss, she slides the jeans off and my hard cock juts up as she turns me into the couch. Her hand slowly uncovers my cock as she kneels down and starts stroking me the same way that she massages my balls. My skin prickles with pleasure as she strokes me. I can't seem to help but sigh in satisfaction as she does this, and I am amazed that I can feel so good. She slowly licks the head of my dick with her wet tongue before taking the entire length down her throat. After a few more minutes of her work, she slides her lips off me long enough to pull my pants off and throw them in the same drawer which had the camera. She sits back and starts to stroke me again.</p> <p>"Let me make you feel better," she says, and quickly takes me into her mouth again. I can't hold back any longer and begin shooting down her throat. She sucks harder this time until I come almost at once, and then I pull it out with a loud moan. I have never had anyone so willing to pleasure me like this but she seems to really like it and continues sucking and stroking me until I am spent and my dick is clean again.</p> <p>We make our way to the couch and we sit against the head and put our arms around each other. She kisses me, then starts to slide her tongue all around my mouth until she brings it to my lips. This time, she moves it around and finds the bottom of my chin and slowly makes her way up and then stops. She looks down and smiles and then kisses the tip of my nose, a playful move that she knows works.</p> <p>"Do you want to make love to me?" she asks me, "or would you prefer to stay here with me?" I know she isn't lying. She is the hottest girlfriend I know and I can't believe that I'm actually going to be able to make love to her on her own couch. I nod my head in agreement, which tells her that it would be too hard for me to be jealous of what her boyfriend's girlfriend she's been dating. She leans forward, taking my face in her hands, and I notice that she's still wearing that skirt.</p> <p>"Is it okay if I get undressed again?" She asks me, and as I'm struggling not to nod my head, I see her reach back and undress. She is really beautiful, and her body is perfect. I want to kiss her, but we have to make sure not to get caught. I stand up and pull her to me and kiss each other gently while caressing her breasts. After I'm done, I reach back and unsnap my bra and let it fall to the ground. I slowly slide my hands down her side and between us as my other hand moves up from her breasts to her stomach and stops just over her belly button. I turn around towards her as both of us start rubbingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
