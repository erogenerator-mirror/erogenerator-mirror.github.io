"I didn't hear you say a thing?"</p> <p>"I...," she faltered before she could get the courage to reply. A long breath left her lips. "Well... I... it was a-a nice... thing to say." Her voice dropped as she choked back her response.</p> <p>"Oh... well," his voice lowered in volume, "I don't mean to embarrass you, but maybe you better let someone else in, and you can ask a question." And with those words his face came up off to the side and then he looked around, "Is anyone else in here with you, Miss Smith?"</p> <p>"Uh...," she stammered, "yes...," in confusion. Was this actually happening, or was her dream being kept so close to the truth? But suddenly, she realized there was an answer to this question. "Uh, yes, Mr. Ritter. I am, I'm here with you."</p> <p>"Okay..." he sounded relieved but there was a smattering of excitement in his voice, "I want you to go on and ask whoever it is to ask you a question." As he stood up, he took her hand and guided her into a chair across from his office. "If you don't do as I ask, I want to hear what a nice young woman you are. I won't bite, but I will expect an honest answer from you." He reached up, and rubbed her hand. "Just try not to tell anyone on your trip, Miss Smith. You're not going anywhere with anyone else, I promise."</p> <p>Now completely overwhelmed with curiosity, she had to clear her throat, "Mr. Ritter, I don't have anyone to go with with, and... and the... it's not like we haven't already gone on this trip, are we?"</p> <p>"It's not like a trip, it's a vacation. But," he nodded back and forth, "I can't see how you could fit anything into the luggage or other items you might put on, Miss Smith."</p> <p>"Well, if I pack this right, everything's in the suitcase. I'm sure we can find somebody to keep it all. I'll check the other rooms, and you can go ahead and put everything in the trunk. And if you want to go back to the room with you, then that's entirely up to you but we have a free afternoon for all of your stuff to be ready for you. I already asked the people we've checked before for any luggage to bring up."</p> <p>As he spoke, she tried not to let on, that he was really, really excited about this, at least the part about being alone with her, which she would probably never have. Yet, she could already feel the moistness building between her legs, and so her hands moved quickly to her lap to rub herself for all she was worth. She thought of him as she did so, imagining him running his hands in her hair as she kneaded the muscles on her wrists and felt something she'd never felt before inside, and it wasn't just the thought of her dream lover.</p> <p>"Yes, Miss Smith." He nodded his head and smiled as he said the words that had been in his mind for a very long time. "I know I shouldn't tell you this, but I always wanted to ask you something about your life. You see, I didn't realize it would be this easy for me to have those thoughts."</p> <p>"I can't really tell you that right now." She smiled, as she spoke. "But at some point, you might want to come with me. There's nothing to be afraid of, though. I'm sure it's just a little more than just being you and I, so you could probably get used to the idea. I know you can handle it, you've already got a whole lot of people who will do anything you want them to do to you and if you don't feel right... well, just get on, get some sleep and then you're free. Go, and you can let yourself in."</p> <p>She knew he was sincere, but she could feel the desire and fear she had for him. She knew it wasn't just that he didn't know this, but he didn't have a way of finding out what might be in her mind, what she wanted to hear. And she could also tell there was a strong longing that wanted to be with her very best friend for all she was real. She was a little scared to even consider what might be in front of her when she finally reached her room, and after she'd knocked on her door, she sat on the edge of a nearby chair and leaned back on it as her legs spreadâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
