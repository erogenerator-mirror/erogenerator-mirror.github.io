"Now it's my turn, it's my turn to please you!"</p> <p>Her eyes fluttered between his and his growing erection, causing him to feel like he was on the verge of bursting open in excitement. She slowly moved off of his lap and climbed onto him.</p> <p>"Are you kidding me?" she teased, "You're so horny, do you want to give it to me?"</p> <p>He shook his head in protest, "Just lie back, I want to feel your naked body in my arms," he mumbled.</p> <p>She giggled and lowered herself down on him, her hands exploring his body. He wrapped his arms around her and they began a slow, sensual journey down her back. She spread her legs, making it nearly impossible to move against him.</p> <p>"I can't wait to get back to my room again," she said.</p> <p>"Oh, you have a good time, there's so much more that was left," he sighed.</p> <p>She reached down and grasped his hard cock and slowly began to rub the tip against her. He groaned, but didn't move for the moment. In fact, he placed his hands on the sides of her hips and began the grinding motion that had their first night together working. She had always wanted him. Now he was making it a fantasy that would never, ever happen.</p> <p>He kissed her passionately, his hands roaming around her body, feeling the muscles, the curves and her soft soft flesh. They rolled their bodies over and the motion became more pleasurable, as they slowly rubbed along each other, finding every erogenous zone of skin.</p> <p>"Oh, God," he moaned.</p> <p>"That's the idea," she cooed.</p> <p>Her hand began to rub his cock, lightly, feeling every ridge and bulace of him. He groaned a little more and began to move against her. She wrapped her legs around him as he thrust deep in and began to move together in a slow rhythm in between them. She pulled away, his cock withdrawing from her slowly so they could both begin to move, rocking against each other. He could feel her breasts press against his chest and her lips touch his in a passionate kiss. He began to thrust himself slowly into her and stopped and pulled back, watching her face as she groaned in pleasure. His movements began faster, his hands now grasping her sides while they both looked deep into each others eyes.</p> <p>He continued thrusting, almost pulling completely out of her before slamming himself back in her hard. He grabbed her face, kissing her hard as he drove into her, feeling the muscles in her back begin to spasm around his cock.</p> <p>"Oh, God...yes..." she groaned.</p> <p>He held her up with one hand, still moving his cock into her body. His fingertips found her clit and stroked it lightly as they both moaned simultaneously in unison. In his eyes was that of someone who was about to explode. Her climax came quickly and felt like an instant, her body trembled and shook with the passion she felt.</p> <p>He slowed his thrusting, letting her legs fall to the bed. After a moment he pulled out of her slowly and sat up. She smiled down at him, still holding his erection. He lay down next to her, his head on her shoulder, his arm around her waist. He kissed her neck, her chest, as his hand moved slowly and methodically down and over her stomach again, towards her lips. His hands caressed her belly, feeling her flinch when his fingertips found her body's hardening nipple.</p> <p>"Oh, God, do that again, I'm..."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Just a tease," she smiled. He leaned away from her, causing her to sigh.</p> <p>"Well, don't expect me to do anything until you say so, then." His hand returned to her sex, slipping up and pressing into her again. "God, I wish we could do more things like this," she murmured.</p> <p>"You don't have to say that," he teased. "I wanted to do this for you, not just for the sex," he smiled to himself as he continued to slowly trace her through her folds. "I'm just getting started," he chuckled. She gasped in delight, letting his finger run along her, making her hips squirm against his hand. He looked deep into her blue eyes with a mischievous grin, then moved his finger away to her opening, gently teasing, until just on the tip of her clit, he slipped inside and she nearly jumped.</p> <p>"Oh, Godâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
