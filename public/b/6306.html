You did the same thing that I did this morning."</p> <p>"Good. I want more than just sex."</p> <p>"How about our mutual sexual satisfaction?"</p> <p>"Mmmm. I was hoping we could make it work." She leaned over and kissed me again, running her hands and the side of my leg gently across my inner thigh. "I'm going to enjoy this."</p> <p>"Just let me take care of you."</p> <p>"OK." We lay together naked, our bodies slick with sweat, kissing and stroking each other. As our lips and faces cooled, we lay together in bliss. Our passion was so strong, that we held on to each other and never let go. When we were both exhausted, we lay down next to each other, taking each other in our arms. The smell of the ocean filtered in the bathroom and the sound of the waves on the shore. We held each other, enjoying each other's caresses. We slept much longer, with no words spoken over the phone.</p> <p>The next morning came too early to enjoy the freedom of the water that the weekend had brought. We both showered and dressed, and then returned to the suite to join the party. Our evening activities were somewhat more frenetic; drinking wine, dancing and flirting, to the extent that the two of us stayed drunk. We took turns kissing and touching from the neck down. In just a few short minutes, all inhibitions were off. Finally, I knelt before her, grabbed her ankles and pushed my face into her legs and her pussy, which was now glistening from her own moisture. I licked her pussy, slowly, savoring her dew on my tongue and lips. Her fingers grasped my hair as her tongue sought my clit. I sucked her clit, gently, as she slid a finger in and out of my pussy and into my ass. Slowly in and out, she slid her fingers in and out. She was in charge; she was in charge of my being fucked, and I was there to be used. I was helpless under her, her control. I loved it and she loved it. I loved the things she did to me, and loved it and wanted it more and more.</p> <p>"Fuck me hard," she hissed at me, with a smile.</p> <p>I stood up, stepped into her room and locked the door, while she bent over the bed, spreading her cheeks as far apart as they would go. I grabbed her hips and pounded her from behind. As I did, I turned her around and forced her knees apart and placed my cock to her ass. I had never been this big, ever. It hurt a little as I was in her, but by the time I was in her bottom, it was a little deeper. I wanted to do her harder, but I wanted this to last as long as it could.</p> <p>I could feel her orgasm building. Her body tensed up and I pulled out and turned her around once more before ramming my cock into her until the whole length was in. I held that position, as my cock swelled inside of her and began to spurt wave upon wave of hot cream into her ass. Her orgasm was the first of many, because we made loud noise when we came. I pulled out and stepped up to her face and sucked the cum still running down her chin until she opened her mouth and stuck her tongue out as far as she could. The warm cum shot out so hard it started to sting.</p> <p>As I kissed my way down her body, leaving her skin glistening with sweat, I felt the sting of my slaps on her. Her body relaxed as I started to kiss between her legs, while she used her tongue to run my finger over my lips. My mouth ran from her slit up to the bottom of her lips and her clit, where I nibbled and kissed her as she began to orgasm again. Suddenly, even though I'm pretty sure I didn't last much longer, she screamed, "oh god."</p> <p>When I had finished with the little slut, and my cock was still hard as a rock, I climbed on top, slid my cock into her and started fucking her. As the pace of the fucking picked up, I reached around with my other hand and grabbed her tits and pushed them together while moving in and out. There was no changing positions from how we often did it. I'd just lay on my back for her. She came up to me and knelt between my legs, while I moved my cock in and out of her pussy. I played with those big tits and she used her hand to rub them from the base to the tip of my cock. We were still close together.</p> <p>After a couple of minutes, I reached under her and fingered her asshole as her orgasm passed.
