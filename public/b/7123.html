I wondered how my eyes would look on her in the next room but fortunately not from the street. We could always move further down to look at the city, but not now.</p> <p>My friend quickly put on quite a smile as I walked by. "So how was your night in to the bar tonight?" she asked me.</p> <p>"It was great thanks."</p> <p>She paused, and then continued, "What do you think of my hair?"</p> <p>Shaking my head, I said, "This would have to come as a surprise."</p> <p>"Would do!" she replied. "So what would you like? I'm sure you've never tried it before."</p> <p>"No but it's the best hair in the world."</p> <p>"Oh my! It's been a while!" She paused again, and looked me up and down.</p> <p>I think I've gotten better at it, especially with some of my friends. She smiled then, and said, "So have you ever had a wig on?"</p> <p>"No. I'm not too old to try, but I don't know what to do."</p> <p>"Sure, go ahead."</p> <p>She pulled her hair away from her face, and let it cascade over her shoulders.</p> <p>"Do yours ever get a tumble?"</p> <p>"That's an interesting topic. I've only had my ear pierced once."</p> <p>"Really? Where do you get them?"</p> <p>She blushed a little again, and said, "Well not really, but where my dad goes they are a bit old."</p> <p>"Oh."</p> <p>"Can I ask you something about my hair?"</p> <p>"Sure. Why not?" I said.</p> <p>"I'm not too busy to visit often." She said softly. Then, she pulled aside her hair, revealing her beautiful long black hair. I could only stare at her long black hair with her deep green eyes, for a second.</p> <p>"I don't mean anything by it. If someone asks about my hair, they don't get to touch my hair, ok?"</p> <p>"I'll let them do that, ok."</p> <p>"Ok."</p> <p>"Do you think they are safe?"</p> <p>"They aren't too bad."</p> <p>"They're really beautiful, don't you think so?"</p> <p>"Oh yeah, ok"</p> <p>"And you like how it looks on people, don't you?"</p> <p>"I guess."</p> <p>"Well, I like it." She smiled at me, and leaned back, placing her arms behind her head, as she began to sway her hair softly over my lap.</p> <p>"Is that better? I'm still very shy, and I'd really like to try it."</p> <p>"That's more like it."</p> <p>I gently grabbed her hands, and began to shake hers.</p> <p>"I'm nervous and excited," she said, "but I feel more comfortable here."</p> <p>"Me too, I'm sure. You should try it out though."</p> <p>"If it's really bad, I'd really love to."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"It can be... It can be really scary sometimes." she chuckled, looking at me in the eyes.</p> <p>"Ok, then. I'll let them do it. I promise. It'll be fun."</p> <p>She seemed to relax. I put my hands around her, and began to shake her hands one by one. "No, no, you're not like that. It'll be very interesting!"</p> <p>She smiled at me again and began to get more excited.</p> <p>"It will be fun... really fun... for me. Do you think it's really dark?"</p> <p>"Depends if its for you or me... If it's so dark for you, I think it's really good too."</p> <p>"Thank you," she said, giving her face a quick wave. "I'd like to say it's really nice. This is the first time I've ever been nervous."</p> <p>"Well we're looking forward to seeing you tomorrow." I said, feeling a sudden rush as I knew I was about to get lucky.</p> <p>"Good bye, Jack."</p> <p>"Bye" and I waved to her, as she stood up and started to walk towards the door.</p> <p>"Can you just stop for a moment, I have an extra little place for you to come by." She winked at me and walked out of the building, and I turned to her, "Do you really think it's ok to come by after a night like that?"</p> <p>"Of course! And if anything happens, just let me know."</p> <p>*</p> <p>Thanks to my fansâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
