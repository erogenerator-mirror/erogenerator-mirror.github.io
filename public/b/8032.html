I could use another shower I guess." Her body stiffened and her eyes widened as one of those feelings rushed past the pit of her stomach. This time there was very little resistance as she felt her arousal building to a level only she felt with her ex. Without conscious thought she began kissing and sucking. She moaned loudly as sensations started to course through her body. A second climax ripped through her body.</p> <p>"God, I've wanted to do this for so long." Her eyes rolled in their sockets.</p> <p>"Didn't think you would ever really have a chance with another man did you?'</p> <p>"Nope."</p> <p>"Why not? We haven't been married in over 20 years and we haven't had sex in nearly a year."</p> <p>"I'm sure we can still get it up, if you want."</p> <p>"I don't know."</p> <p>"That's okay. Just do it."</p> <p>She knew her ex liked her and probably got off on the idea of having sex with them. She looked at the two of them and could only agree, but still, she felt she owed it to them to say no. She stood up and went into her bedroom to dress on her bed. She was very conscious of how she looked. She looked as sexy as she could without her glasses and shirt.</p> <p>Her lover and her ex were still in the living room. She sat on the sofa next to Roger, her skirt slightly hiked up, legs crossed, shirt partially unbuttoned below her bra, knees up, hands on her lap, looking at them as they sat there.</p> <p>"So you're not mad at me for the offer on your friend's house?"</p> <p>"No, sweetie. I'm a little disappointed."</p> <p>She watched them sit there for a second. She stood up, her skirt slightly riding up. She saw they both were looking at her and she saw her nipples showing as the shirt barely had a front and the skirt rode up to show her very wet pussy.</p> <p>"I know you're disappointed with the offer. I really don't mind you doing it. It's okay with me in some ways." She laughed at her joke. She pulled out her cell phone and showed a picture of him and her. She held it in front of her eye and then looked at the pictures, "Do you like this one honey?" She asked him.</p> <p>"Yes, very much."</p> <p>She got more and more excited as she watched his facial expressions. This time, she could feel both herself and him. She felt like the fantasy was about to happen and was surprised her body reacted as it usually did.</p> <p>"Are you hard again?"</p> <p>"We haven't done anything yet."</p> <p>She had taken off her clothes and when he saw her breasts that much had happened. He thought for a moment. He liked her breasts and the way they were sitting up. He liked them a lot. He liked her body and was turned on by what she did to him.</p> <p>"Go ahead, touch them."</p> <p>He reached out and took a nipple and then slowly rolled it around with his finger. When it was hard again, he squeezed it. She moaned, "That's nice."</p> <p>"Not yet."</p> <p>She put her phone on the coffee table and bent back over it.</p> <p>"Are you ready?"</p> <p>"Yes please."</p> <p>He put his dick in her and slowly, very slowly, made it into her. She gasped, "Oh my fucking god!" He pulled it all the way out and then quickly pushed back inside.</p> <p>"Oh my god! Yes! Now fuck me!"</p> <p>They both stared at her as the two orgasms came crashing over them. She held his hips and felt like the waves of pleasure were still going on and on.</p> <p>As the waves ebbed, they both began to come to their senses. Her pussy suddenly got cold.</p> <p>"Now let me go home."</p> <p>He laughed, "I'll stay with you. We're never going to take something like that back."</p> <p>"We are and I want to stay with you forever."</p> <p>"I love you."</p> <p>Roger got dressed and left.</p> <p>"What the fuck did she think this was about?" She asked herself.</p> <p>Roger was in her office, looking for the door when her phone rang. She walked over to him and picked it up, "Hello?"</p> <p>"Hi, it's Jack. Can we talk?"</p> <p>"Sure. Are you okay? I'm about to call for a delivery."</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm fine. Just a little worried there."</p> <p>"I'm fine. Have to get a flight home later tonight. Are you there?"</p> <p>"Yeah. I am.
