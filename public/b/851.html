She was about 5'4", with dark hair and green eyes. Her body was flawless, her breasts and pussy ample and perky. I could see the way her legs moved as she stepped onto the large couch.</p> <p>"Dianne?"</p> <p>I could only mutter an affirmative and watched her head disappear into the small bedroom as Dianne followed quickly, her lips and tongue exploring my girlfriend's body, her arms wrapping around her waist and pulling her closer. Dianne was not wearing a bra and it looked so beautiful on her. "Dianne!" I said again, my eyes widening in shock as she slipped off the couch onto her knees and crawled up the other side, her face a little closer to mine, as she pushed her breasts together and rubbed them together, my girlfriend giving a small moan as she leaned against Dianne, who was stroking her hair. My eyes were glued to the two beautiful women, my cock still erect, my hands grabbing as they played with each other.</p> <p>Dianne moved and got down on all fours, facing me as she grabbed my cock by the base, her long hair falling over her face as she bent over and took it into her mouth and began sucking again. My girlfriend was moaning as she rubbed up and down my shaft.</p> <p>"Dianne" I said as I moved away from her and moved to the side and pushed my hard cock towards the two young ladies, who were now sitting there, their legs intertwined and one of Dianne's hands rubbing her pussy through the fabric of her skirt. I slid my hands under her skirt, stroking my hands up and down as she rubbed her own pussy, her fingers working over her clit as she sucked my cock, her pussy sliding up and down over my fingers.</p> <p>Dianne stopped and sat up, rubbing my girlfriend's shoulder softly. "Heather" she said as her eyes met mine, her hands working to unzip my girlfriend's dress.</p> <p>"Don't stop" my girlfriend moaned as she leaned forward, her eyes locking back on mine as she felt my wife's fingers touch her bare neck, caressing there, her eyes closing as Dianne pulled the dress off over her head, my girlfriend's body exposed as they kissed, her pussy shaved as Dianne pushed my wife onto the large sofa as she knelt down, my girlfriend spreading her legs and reaching her own orgasm, the sound of my wife cumming a soft moan as Dianne grabbed her hair pulling it over her shoulder as she ground her pussy hard against my wife's head.</p> <p>A soft moan came from my lips as my wife continued to moan in orgasm, Dianne then reached into the bag and brought out a large pink vibrators. "I don't think this is your type" I told Dianne as her eyes widened at my wife removing her strap on, her big tits hanging just enough for me to suck on before sliding underneath her, and then my fingers were sliding under the elastic of my wife's panties as Dianne began to tease my fingers by rubbing her lips up and down, as I watched two of the largest toys in my life slide up and down across Dianne's pussy lips.</p> <p>"What do you think?" Dianne asked, her gaze dropping to my cock, stroking it as I sat up and watched her. Dianne slid her panties off as her dress was pulled down. "This is what I'm looking for", the look on my wife's face as she pulled them off her body, her large tits hanging as my wife pulled the skimpy panties from under her, the material a tight wet material, my wife stepping out of them as Dianne slid them down her legs and off, her pussy hair wet and sticky from her own cum as my wife bent over and began to lick her.</p> <p>"Watch us" Dianne said as she ran her fingers over my wife's swollen lips, Dianne's tongue licking the juices that were being drawn from her and down my girlfriend's lips as my fingers slid into my wife's cunt, slowly at first then faster and faster as I watched Dianne's long tongue slide deep as her teeth teased my wife's clit and then slid down, Dianne holding my wife's legs open as his fingers slide in and out of my wife's snatch as Dianne's body trembled with her own orgasm. "You're going to have to fuck us, he's got us all hot and wet for you." My wife said.</p> <p>Dianne nodded, as she walked around and placed them into my hands. "I'm going to take them from you now," and she turned around. Dianne put one hand on the arm of the sofa facing mine, and used one hand to slide the other between my girlfriend's legs, as my wife stepped back and got into the position.</p> <p>Dianne got the first end of the vibrator, rubbing it over one ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
