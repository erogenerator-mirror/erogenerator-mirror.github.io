Katie's fingers were still rubbing me, as I continued to work on her.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"I like that" I was feeling something, even more intense, when she took her fingers and replaced them with her thumb. I loved that feeling! It drove me wild. I wanted to let go and let her do anything she wanted. I didn't want her to stop, that was all I wanted this time. All I wanted to do, and even in that moment, was to keep it all for myself.</p> <p>"Now I want to know what you'll do to me when I do."</p> <p>I did the other half of the movement, and after a few seconds I felt it happen again. She'd slid her hand off me, and was gently stroking me, with her fingers in between. Every time I felt her thumb on my right hand, she'd run it through my hair, and even around my nose. I felt like I was getting close to orgasm, and I started to move my mouth, trying to match her movements, but her movements stopped me;</p> <p>"Wait" she pushed my head down.</p> <p>She took her other hand off her pussy, and slowly slipped it under the thong. Her fingers slid across her clitoris, her body jerking. I couldn't stop it anymore! Ohhhh, god, I'm coming! And it kept coming! She took both of her hands away, and put them where she was, between her legs. "Oh fuck, you feel so good."</p> <p>She had both hands on her hand, and started to move it again. She was pushing my head down towards her pussy! Oh my, I wanted to take my lips right there.</p> <p>"Keep licking"</p> <p>I wanted a lick, if that had anything to do with it. I continued to work, trying to be as good a lover as I had been in the past. It didn't take long for me to get the most intense climax. It went on! I've never felt like this before, I felt like I just wanted to cum! She was still jerking me off, and had stopped moving her mouth, to finish me off. That made me feel as good as if it was all over me! I don't think I'd ever be that good of a lover when my cock is being licked! I wanted to hold my orgasm, while she held it, and I wanted to kiss her while it was going on. I kept working, and eventually managed to get a couple of more orgasms out. I just lay there, gasping for air, as she was still jerking me off;</p> <p>"That was fantastic. I like you." Katie's voice sounded almost surprised.</p> <p>It didn't take me long to get my composure back. I looked at her and could see that she was really satisfied. I said;</p> <p>"I'd like to take a shower now. I need to get something to clean up with."</p> <p>"Yes, let's do that now." With that she stood up, and we both turned to walk out together. I still had my hand on me, and couldn't figure out what she was doing;</p> <p>"Did you bring a bath towel?"</p> <p>"I put one in the bathroom. I'll take it now."</p> <p>Katie led me in to the bathroom.</p> <p>"Let me wash you."</p> <p>"Okay." It felt strange, when my hand was there, but what bothered me the most is that she washed me. I didn't know how to react;</p> <p>"So, we're having the same kind of a relationship with each other."</p> <p>"I know, but it's not exactly natural. It may be that I'll change our relationship."</p> <p>"That's fair to say."</p> <p>She turned the lights down, and we washed each other. Her hand was so good that it almost hurt.</p> <p>"Does that mean I've been doing this a lot?"</p> <p>She gave me a quick wink, and walked me to the chair.</p> <p>"What can I do with it?"</p> <p>"Anything, please."</p> <p>"It feels lovely so far."</p> <p>"You're sure?"</p> <p>"Yes, I'm sure, I'm almost positive I'm going to be doing this a lot."</p> <p>She reached up and caressed my cheek,</p> <p>"I'm going to be doing it a lot just the same."</p> <p>She pulled herself up, and she was about to wrap her robe around herself again, but stopped, and she looked me in the eyes,</p> <p>"I'll need something to clean you up with."</p> <p>I leaned forward towards her, but she moved away, and started to clean her. When my mouth got to the end of her pussy, she moved her body away.</p> <p>"No, I wantâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
