He knew he'd told the right man, but he'd never heard an answer.</p> <p>"Let's say I told you something nice and important. That if you really are that special, then you deserve someone who will give you anything and everything you want. Is that enough of an answer?"</p> <p>"Yes," he gasped, feeling as if he were back in high school before he graduated. "I've done everything for you, and more. I'll do anything for you."</p> <p>"Anything?" her question.</p> <p>"Yes," he agreed, feeling his heart beating rapidly. "Anything."</p> <p>The man turned back around to face her. With her full red lips, he kissed her softly, then parted his mouth to gently massage her tongue with his tongue. All that was left to go was the memory of the way she touched him, how her soft lips felt around him, how she made him feel. He'd had a crush on her for a while, but then it'd just been a dream, now it was real and he could feel the chemistry between them.</p> <p>He pulled away, smiling broadly, and held out his hand, hoping to get a hold of her again. He felt she'd accept it, and he was willing to let her use his body any way or else it would disappear. He reached for her hand again, feeling her fingers tremble, and pulled her back towards him.</p> <p>He could smell the faint scent of her hair, and the fragrance of the perfume she'd worn a while ago—the familiar smell of that perfume—and he felt as if he was smelling her. She was warm and soft and smooth and warm...</p> <p>"I hope you don't think I'm gay..." she said to him, looking a little startled by his expression.</p> <p>"Not at all," he replied. "I'm just..."</p> <p>"Gay? Is that it."</p> <p>"No," he agreed, squeezing her hand lightly. He knew that as much as he wanted to, she wasn't his type, but he couldn't stand to be the kind of girl who would change that.</p> <p>She looked back at him expectantly, and suddenly he knew that maybe this wasn't all too bad after all. He felt suddenly proud that he was still the same, and when he looked into her eyes she was holding him back. "I'm a girl, right?" he asked, reaching to brush her hair back from her face.</p> <p>"Yes, of course you are."</p> <p>"What do you like about this world?" he asked.</p> <p>"That's probably the biggest question you're asking yourself," she replied, looking as serious as ever. "I'm not saying I like it, but I can't say if I really like it or not. I'm just saying to myself... what we have is special, and I know I'll see you again."</p> <p>"You're still here, aren't you." This time he was blunt, but he could be playful all-around and knew that if she were a little more receptive she'd be happier with him here. He was surprised she felt herself relax enough not to push him away, but she certainly hadn't made any attempt to discourage him.</p> <p>"You're here to be mine, that's it, no more secrets between the two of us?" he said, laughing gently as he touched her elbow. "Just try to keep your mind open to the possibilities."</p> <p>He watched her face as she took a deep breath, and then leaned her face forward softly so as not to startle him, and he saw what was almost written across her expression. The warmth she seemed to radiate came almost immediately. He felt the heat of her body, her soft brown skin and the softness of her hair. It was as close to a relationship he'd ever been in, and he wondered just how far that might be. But after just a second she was kissing him, not a frantic kiss like they'd been in her dream, but a soft and loving kiss that reminded him of her first...</p> <p>The feel of her lips on his body was like nothing he'd ever experienced. It was different somehow, like the feel of his own skin. He'd never felt the way she felt, and he wasn't sure what exactly her experience with him was like as he felt her warmth and the softness of her lips on his. He took a deep breath and relaxed, enjoying the feeling of her lips on his body, letting the feeling slowly begin to seep through his body.</p> <p>He leaned his face forward, looking at her eyes. They were closed, and he knew she could see in his expression how excited she was.
