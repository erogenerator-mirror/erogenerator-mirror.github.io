I felt her arms go around me and her legs wrap around mine. Her hips rolled on top of me with her arms sliding up and down my body. I reached up and lifted her, feeling my softness and warm body wrap around hers. We lay there, holding each other as we kissed, feeling each others' arousal. We kissed slowly on her face before her lips traveled down the side of my neck to my chest where her kisses traveled through between my breasts. Her hands continued to rub along the sides of my body. It wasn't long before we were on top of each other, our hips pressing into each other. I could feel her erect nipples pressed up against the soft skin of my breasts as we grinded together to the beat of our hips. Her kisses got bolder as time passed. The heat between us grew, her breathing picked up, her moans became more frantic. All of a sudden, she got more aggressive. I could feel the moist heat of her body against my flesh. I could feel my own juices flowing as her lips pressed hard to mine. They pressed into me, pulling my lips apart. Her tongue slipped inside my mouth and danced with mine. The kiss was so soft it made me want to melt against her in the most intense way. My lips parted from hers and our tongues continued to play with each other. I could feel our juices as we rubbed together; we didn't need to take a shower for me to find the sweet nectar of our passion. We kissed deeply for what seemed like forever.</p> <p>"C'mon," she whispered into my ears as she pulled of the bedding. "Roll on your back." She slipped onto the floor of the shower, climbing on top of me and straddling me. Her hands lifted my hands high above her head as she moved them down her body to my breasts. Their softness felt so good against my skin. I could feel her wet heat against my skin, pushing into my sides as she moved. She stopped for a second allowing my hands to rest on her breasts. I could feel the tip of her nipples press into me, as the swollen nubs pressed into me. She leaned forward and put her arms around my shoulders. I could feel her breasts brushing against my own as she slid up me, until her lips kissed me once more. I could feel the wetness on where our bodies met. She rolled me over so that she would be on top of me. She was breathing hard just above my breasts, her breasts pressed tightly against my skin. She rubbed up and down my body, making sure our hips rubbed against each other as she pressed down against me; she would lean back against my stomach as her breasts brushed against my skin. I could feel my breasts sliding along hers, my nipples sliding between her fingers as their tips brushed along her skin. She lowered herself on me, pressing her wet heat against her. We both groaned as our hips moved against each other with a passion that we had never felt. As I felt the warm flesh of her nipples touch mine, I reached down and cupped her ass as she pressed down against me. She felt so sexy against me, and I was getting hard again. She rolled us over so that she still lay on top of me, but I could feel her breasts pressed tight to mine, her nipples hard against mine. We kissed as she moved back up to lie beside me, just pressing her body against mine, my hard length pushing against her. We kissed again briefly, and both of us knew we wanted more. The way our bodies pressed together, our heat, we didn't need much foreplay, but I wanted more. With one hand, we caressed each others' flesh, our fingers exploring each other as we laid together on the wet floor of the shower. We lay there touching each other, touching each other, pressing our sexes together. Our faces were touching as we rubbed ourselves against each other, trying to get each other to come for us. We were both moaning, feeling the wetness of our sexes against each other, our heads rolling back and forth as we both moved against each other. We could both feel us getting hotter. We started to rub ourselves harder against each other, our hips moving as well. We both felt our own orgasm building as I moved down so that I was on top of her thighs, my hard length sliding up and down against her. I could feel the heat and wetness of her body as I pushed in, sliding up and down with her. She wrapped her legs tightly around me. We both felt the heat and our need as we kissed. We were both moaning in pleasure as our bodies pressed against each other.</p> <p>Our hips moved together, grinding in the same rhythm, as our moans made it all so intensely exciting. Our hands reached up to caress each other's necks as we kissed passionately. I could feel her breasts pressing to my chest as I moved from her back to stroke them withâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
