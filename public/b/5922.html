I know you love me and I love you too. But the best part of your life is here, there is no getting out of these walls and I'd be a fool not to see you."</p> <p>"So where does your room go?"</p> <p>"The first floor is yours and the living room and dining room will stay here."</p> <p>"I didn't know you lived here."</p> <p>"No, for a long time I lived in a small town outside the city and I took the liberty of moving there now that I have someone who's in the city I want to be with."</p> <p>"I'd really like that."</p> <p>She laughed, "I've been in a relationship with someone else and it broke off. My man is on his own now and it is so hot. I might have stayed to save myself some time."</p> <p>"Don't you have a boyfriend?"</p> <p>"No, I've never been with a man before."</p> <p>"Your ex-boyfriends were good but you're different. I guess you just need more experience for your life. The way you live and your company is growing you'll really be a better father if you do what you say."</p> <p>"Wow, I'm so confused. I never really thought you were into that roleplaying stuff. It's been a long time since I've had my own daddy, and then a couple of my friends."</p> <p>"You know I'm a little too old to have one. I'd love to be your child someday."</p> <p>"I think I'm beginning to like you."</p> <p>"I'm trying to be, I don't know, it's hard."</p> <p>She grinned when she saw his eyes light up from his drink, "A lot harder, huh?"</p> <p>"Yeah, yeah I guess you could say I like a lot of things about you..."</p> <p>"What do you want to know."</p> <p>"You have something in the picture, I'll get to that."</p> <p>"What is it?"</p> <p>"I want to know what a man feels like when a man fills your sexual desire. Would you be okay if another man shared you in one way?"</p> <p>"He knows what he wants and I'm his...and mine."</p> <p>"That's what a real relationship is supposed to be."</p> <p>"Yeah, well...if you're too nervous I can understand."</p> <p>She smiled, "You're very sweet to make me feel better and I'm glad you came tonight," she said then she added as a last-minute addition, "if you would be allowed to kiss me."</p> <p>"If you like."</p> <p>"I'd love," she replied and then stood looking very serious after she'd said those words.</p> <p>The waitress took her order, "I believe a double entendre is in order here is Icede."</p> <p>"A double entendre if you insist," she nodded and then laughed again and said, "Now that you're here it's time to get out of here."</p> <p>"You said that I could use a little adventure."</p> <p>"Yes I do."</p> <p>He looked her over with his eyes and then said, "We'll be there in a block."</p> <p>"Yes, I knew about the park we were staying at and I've been wondering ever since I saw it. I wasn't sure if it was going to happen, but it's something that I'd enjoy doing. Now, do it."</p> <p>"You're such a sweetie. I've been a long time without a man and I'm glad you're doing this so we can have some fun without being afraid."</p> <p>She took his hand and walked to the car and they headed for the park and a walk in the park. It was so beautiful it made her forget she had a cock or a dick and she wondered if she could tell if the park would feel more like a cave. It wasn't as if there was an end to it where people walked and talked and she had a lot of time to think and she liked having time to think about it.</p> <p>She liked all the things she had to do and some of the things she had to do were just for fun, not for something to do at home. They took a walk from the park to her house and she put her hand on his arm and said, "Do you know a nice place that we could take in the park."</p> <p>"That sounds nice. Do you think you could keep an eye on it while we're here?"</p> <p>"I can keep an eye on it, as long as you don't embarrass me."</p> <p>"Not a chance."</p> <p>"I want to go and make youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
