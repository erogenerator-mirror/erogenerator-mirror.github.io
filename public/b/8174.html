But I was wondering if you would ever let me stay with you in our dorm room?" I asked her. "How about tonight?"</p> <p>"I want to try and have dinner with someone."</p> <p>"Would you like to go to my place, if you were a guest?" I asked her.</p> <p>She thought about it. It was sort of a question, since she didn't have friends and was still trying to come up with a good excuse to let me stay. "Yes," she said.</p> <p>"Then I'll pick you up in a half hour. Don't have plans, or do you have friends coming with you?"</p> <p>"They're all here for tonight."</p> <p>"Are you sure you don't want to be with me tonight?" I said, trying to sound reassuring.</p> <p>"I'm sure. But I can't tell them that I'm staying at your place."</p> <p>"I understand. You can stay with me tonight and I'll pick you up and we'll finish the conversation we need to get started."</p> <p>She smiled and got out a key for the garage and the driver's door to the front door, and we walked down the two flights to the end of the drive and out to the waiting car. We got in and went into my apartment and I picked the bed up for her and told her to lay the white satin sheets on top, and hung up the drapes. She got in bed with me and laid her head on my chest. I started to get a hard on and I couldn't resist giving her a tender kiss.</p> <p>"I feel so good tonight. I want you to stay here with me. Will you do that for me?" she asked.</p> <p>"Sure," I said.</p> <p>I got out my bed cover and put on a short robe I left on the night stand and went to bed early. I got in bed and laid there thinking of the two of us lying there with this new experience we were having. It was a first for me, and a lot of the girls I had been with had wanted to sleep with me. For some reason they said they got tired of the bed they couldn't find anywhere else to lie on, but I didn't really understand it. I got out my phone and called the restaurant/home office, hoping to be able to stay in the apartment with the two of us for a couple hours. We hung up and I turned over the covers, and we fell asleep as soon as I was done with the call.</p> <p>I woke around 3 am or so before I heard the door open and saw Sarah coming in a little after 3 pm from her job at the grocery store. She said she didn't recognize the apartment and thought it was just a place it was. We spent the morning in a normal discussion, while she called out to other people for help with shopping and cleaning, so I figured things would be going to fine without me staying in. She found a place to stay until 5 or so, and she also found an apartment near a store that she wanted to stay in. She was also able to find what she needed for her classes, so it wouldn't be the last time we got together.</p> <p>When she got back to her small apartment, I got the bed out for her, and she quickly lay down in my bed, and we fell asleep in each other's arms in less than an hour. About nine o'clock, the phone rang, and it was Becky asking what we had talked about all day, and what we did. Becky had a new roommate for the evening and I was having a hard time paying attention to the conversation while she talked with Sarah on the phone.</p> <p>"Well, Sarah was happy to come over and take a look at your place," I said.</p> <p>"What are you talking about?" she said.</p> <p>"The same thing it always is when we go out. It seems we all are here for each other tonight."</p> <p>"What did she say?" she asked.</p> <p>"She said, 'I've got to work until Sunday.' She's going to be in my house for tonight, and tomorrow, and tomorrow night. So I'll probably be sleeping in. Will that work for you?"</p> <p>"If nothing happens, or your roommate is out of town, what would we do?" she asked.</p> <p>"What would work for me?" I asked.</p> <p>"Well, you could be spending the night with us, or you could stay with us," she suggested.</p> <p>"I don't know if we can do that," I said.</p> <p>"What are you talking about?" she asked.</p> <p>"There's another thing I want to show you."</p> <p>Beckâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
