Her tongue would slip out of her mouth to play with the ring on my finger. "Will it be good for you?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes..." I whispered.</p> <p>Her hand slipped under the thin robe and pulled down the front of my panties, her long nails playing with my sensitive bud. Her mouth moved down to my breast, her tongue licking at my nipple, her hand finding it's way inside my panties, finding what she wanted with her fingers. It was time.</p> <p>She leaned down to my mouth and with a low, throaty voice, "You taste so good, my sweet... I wonder what it would be like with you next?" She licked her lips and slid two fingers into my slit.</p> <p>My whole body responded with an electrical charge and I let out a low moan of pleasure. She stopped licking my nipple, her finger still working in and out of my wet sex, feeling how good my clit was. She withdrew her fingers to look at me with a naughty smile. "I wanted to tell you something for your birthday."</p> <p>"What's that, sweetheart?" I asked.</p> <p>"You're my birthday present, baby..."</p> <p>Her head moved towards me and her lips met mine, her tongue sliding past my lips while she held me close to her. She felt how wet I was getting and kissed me more urgently this time. "You taste so good, baby..."</p> <p>Then she slid me down on the couch and pushed down my pants, her hair trailing over my thighs as she went. Her face and body were soft, her scent full of anticipation. She climbed on top, straddling me, her breasts resting on my chest. She was ready for the next step.</p> <p>She slid my shirt up over my head, leaving most of it hanging out. I could feel her warmth, her wetness, her nipples poking into my flesh between her breasts, the way it looked in my eyes. Her head lowered, nuzzling at my chin, her moist lips brushing over me.</p> <p>I reached up and caressed the little tuft of blonde hair that pointed to her moist sex. The smell was intoxicating. She moaned, almost purring with desire. I slipped one finger into her and she wrapped her legs around my waist. I moved just a little farther in this time, feeling the soft warmth of her pubic hair and the tip of her clit tease my lips. Her fingers threaded thru my hair and she pulled my face to hers. All along she brushed her lips against mine, kissing me with passion.</p> <p>The tip of one of her nipples brushed against mine through the fabric of our shirts. I was getting wet just from her sweet taste. "Oh my," she gasped, "you taste so good." She moved down and sucked my nipple into her mouth, gently biting it, rubbing her tongue over it. It made her moan with pleasure, her fingers digging into my hair, pulling down. I wanted my tongue to make her cum, just that, just that.</p> <p>We started out by slowly licking each other's lips. She closed her eyes and pressed her hips against mine. It was a sexy, slow, slow rhythm.</p> <p>She raised herself up and rubbed the tip of her pussy against my clit. I shuddered in pleasure. "Uhn!" she whispered, "Oh! Oh fuck yes! Oh, yeeeessssss... I'm gonna cum again!" I felt her clit throb against mine and knew that I was about to cum.</p> <p>She started working herself down my body as she slid the tip of her finger between my pussy lips. "Oh God, baby, that feels so good." Her wet fingers dipped into my wet hole with each thrust of her finger. She teased my hard clit even more, the tip of her finger pressing against it's hood... "Oh, baby it's your birthday, now," she said in a sexy voice, her warm breath against my skin. "But you're never getting out of this. Not unless you buy me."</p> <p>My heart was racing as she said it, her words burning my pussy even hotter. She slipped a second finger into my tight little pussy, sliding her fingers in and out. My pussy felt like it was being filled right now. I pushed her down, my thighs wrapping into her butt. "Oh my!" she moaned, "This is so hot."</p> <p>I spread my legs and opened for her to get more access. I could feel the cool air in the room, the air that I was so desperate to blow between my legs. There were no fan fans for us - this wasn't a heater - but our bodies and mind seemed to be heating each other up. It was as if we could get one to fuck our brains out.
