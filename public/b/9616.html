They were moving down slowly, lightly brushing my skin as he moved in my direction. His fingertips grazed my skin, moving across the back of my arm, then down to my other hand. He was massaging it, so gentle, as I relaxed and began to enjoy the feeling. I was thinking, "This is the best day." He was thinking the same thing. Then his hands were on my other hand, sliding up my forearms. I wanted to pull his hand down farther onto my body and reach up under his sweater, but when I felt the bulge in his pants, I simply stood, pulling it off to the floor, and began unbuttoning his shirt.</p> <p>"God, Rob, this feels so good." I unbuttoned it all the way and felt the warmth from it. His hands were on my hips, sliding into the bottom of my skirt. My body was naked under the layers of my clothing, and it felt so sexy with him un-dressing me. His large hands ran up one side of my body, and down another. I reached up and felt the swell of his chest under his t-shirt. "God, I'm so hard, Rob." I felt his arms tighten around me. Rob's hands slid away, then, as he undid his belt, pulled it right off.</p> <p>"How about you?" Rob whispered, pulling me to him. I was on my back, but my face and chest were covered in a thin layer of my sweat, and I was so turned on by the fact that I felt my own excitement rising. His hands slipped down, under my skirt, rubbing the fabric over my hips and down my thighs. "Hmmm, I think my skirt's up a little bit, and I think I'm wet." I could almost feel the moisture under his touch.</p> <p>"I thought that was how it feels."</p> <p>"I thought so too. How about you?"</p> <p>"I think it's so sexy. I just hope you'll let me take care of you sometime."</p> <p>His hands were slipping under my skirt, lifting it up, past my waist. I had no idea how far he wanted me, or why, it was such a big rush. Our lips just barely touched, then, he reached around behind me and pulled me on top of him. His lips sought mine again. Our mouths moved together so slowly, like we were the last two people on the planet. His arms were around my waist, as his body pressed into me, then pulled away from mine, pulling me hard onto his growing bulge.</p> <p>"Oh, God, this is so naughty," I could almost see him. I started to feel more than just excited. "My sweater is up to my elbows," I couldn't help looking up at the ceiling and the only thing going through my mind was his hands on my body, holding me so tight and pulling me to him.</p> <p>I didn't give a damn what happened next, if anything I was feeling a little more lust than was being with me. His hands slid up my arms, slipping down to my breasts. My nipples were taut and hard under his palms. I closed my eyes and leaned against his body, relishing the feeling of his touch. His body moved a little, slowly, as if he hadn't been holding them forever, and I felt his body tighten as I felt him grow harder then before. When his hands came down to cup my breasts, he held them there, squeezing them. I felt my body arch upward as his hands continued to massage my breasts, rolling my nipples between his fingers.</p> <p>I felt myself begin to lose control, my body taking over, and then I knew it. Rob sensed that I was getting very close, and he pulled me into him, holding me like that, as his hands left my breasts, and slid down my abdomen toward his cock. I could feel his body, even though my body was not really mine to hold on to, and I could feel our bodies moving together. His hands cupped the cheeks of my ass, and pulled me down until his cock was just barely touching me. His cock was just enough for me to lie on it and feel it slide over my pussy, but my body just didn't care. I wanted to spread myself wide, wrap my legs around him and pull him inside me. I didn't think that my body could hold on forever, but then our bodies moved together so smoothly, it was almost like we belonged. Nothing could match this feeling. I was completely helpless. I wanted nothing more than to touch him, and I wanted his body inside me. And he didn't need to be told.</p> <p>My fingers found the buttons of his shirt, and he pulled me down onto him, then rolled himself over, and I was onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
