I can do it all day, I'll just take another run to the car dealership. I have to get back to work, so you can get home too." She told me.</p> <p>"Oh that's too bad then. I'll be home by five, and I can be here by six o'clock." I told her.</p> <p>"You're going home? You're going home? You know my mom will be pissed if any of us go back there on some more."</p> <p>"Yes, I know. Her car died a month ago, and she died five days ago. I'm glad she's not in the hospital, but I'm really glad she's ok."</p> <p>"That's ok though. My mom doesn't have a car at the moment."</p> <p>"That's alright, she's with my dad." She told me.</p> <p>"Your Dad? What do you mean? Dad?"</p> <p>"Yes, he's the head of HR. He does the whole work there."</p> <p>"Oh right."</p> <p>"Look, you can do it, you know. If there are no problems then go on." I told her.</p> <p>"Oh right. I'm not a child!" She told me. She kissed me gently on the lips and walked over to her car. Then she got in the car, and sped off towards my car again. I was pretty tired, but after a little sitting around, I took a shower, got dressed and headed out to see a friend of my mom's and dad's house. I pulled up to the house and walked up the drive. I saw mom's car that she drove up to, and saw her sitting there in her chair, reading a magazine, but I wouldn't be out here, so I figured I better sit down, then I'll try to do the right thing. I walked up the two steps down the drive. I went around the other end of the line, and got into the house. The phone rang, and I heard mom answer. I went over to her desk, and asked, "So when is she going home?"</p> <p>"I'm trying to have a baby, she said she is having surgery the next day. She said she'll let me know when."</p> <p>"What happened?"</p> <p>"She told me to see you, and I just got there. Then I decided to walk home. The surgery wasn't good."</p> <p>"Ok, well I'm really sorry. I have to do something about my dad." I said.</p> <p>"Don't do it. You can go, or stay there, and it'll be ok. He doesn't mind being here."</p> <p>"Yeah, that's why he's not in hospital, I'm just worried sick." I told her.</p> <p>"It's ok. I understand. I guess I will go. I'm not really sure why, but I think I'm just lucky now. I thought my dad would go and get his shit together soon enough." She told me.</p> <p>"Ok, I guess you can go. See you on the way home." I told her.</p> <p>I walked away, and into my garage as I walked up the drive to my house. I took a long shower, and changed into something a little more comfortable, and crawled into bed. I slept like the king and left a note on the comforter saying I'll be sleeping with her tonight. I was snuggled up to my side as I slept. I tried to get some rest, but I just couldn't. When I finally fell asleep, I knew there was nothing wrong, but I still felt a little strange.</p> <p>I awakened a couple of hours later, my eyes were still closed, and I felt someone else's arms wrapped around me. I opened my eyes, and looked down to see my wife in my arms. She just looked back at me with a smile on her face, and said, "Good morning, honey."</p> <p>"Good morning," I replied as she slid her body up mine. She looked back up at me, and said, "Honey, did you sleep well?"</p> <p>"Just as well as you did, you silly old dog." I told her.</p> <p>"Mhmm! You are so sweet, I loved it. Well, I want her to be so happy, so happy you can do it, and I'm going to do it right now, and you'll feel so wonderful." She told me. I didn't answer, because she didn't care that I was a good dog that I had to give her attention. I kissed her as I did, and then sat up and looked down to see my wife sitting on her knees, holding my head in hers, and kissing my neck. "Baby, I love you." She told me.</p> <p>"I love you too, but I will doâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
