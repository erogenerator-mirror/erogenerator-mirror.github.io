One of them went on the phone and started to give me some advice on how to handle the situation, and it showed on the phone. When I told them the truth, they got up and ran away. The next day, I realized that there was nothing I could do, including confront those three, so I went on and began to try and get them back together..."</p> <p>"Yeah, I did. You don't seem too sure about them. Are they a couple, like you say, or have already come out?"</p> <p>"Not really, I think, but some of them have not. The one with the big green eyes was a girl, but it isn't hers. I know for a fact that she's pretty. We went out for her one night, and she gave me her panties because, well, since we were together... Well, my parents have all gone away for some vacation. We don't go to a lot of places, so I thought that we might as well get back together. I wanted to bring her up to speed, and I think I'll do it again."</p> <p>"OK then, so, what brings you up here?"</p> <p>"I've been reading up on that. I read that people were different in the relationship, and that they need not share their partners. I found it interesting though, that people can be different in the bedroom, and you can do that yourself."</p> <p>"I was wondering if there was something here that I should know about. It's been a while since I've had any boyfriends. I might want to try it sometime if you're interested, but I'd be a fool not to." I looked at her, and she just smiled.</p> <p>"You're a smart one, and I don't need anyone coming on to me. We can work something out, if you want."</p> <p>"I certainly want to, if that's OK with you," she replied. "You'd be surprised how comfortable I am with you. Especially from the way you look at other guys." They kissed once more, then she got up and went into the bathroom.</p> <p>I had the house to myself, and my eyes were wandering back and forth from the couple who were still on the phone to the blonde woman. It didn't take her long to return, and was no problem getting my attention. She came by, and we kissed. I had a brief glimpse of her as she got undressed, then she was on her knees, sucking her pussy. I tried not to think about the other couple, but soon started to get a stiffy. I felt like I might hyperventilate, and I managed to take a quick look over at her, and she was looking pretty excited as well. I could feel the moisture on my arm, and my cock was as hard as a rock. She smiled at me and reached up, wrapping her hand around my cock, and started to stroke me. It took only a few strokes for me to shoot all up into her. Now that's kind of a thing people do to get hard. She smiled and said, "Honey, that was amazing, but we have to keep this a secret before we have sex again, so I guess we better go to bed. We can talk about what we want to do tomorrow."</p> <p>"Well, I don't know about that. I guess that I have been too busy to wait a little longer. When you're done, can I use some help with some work?"</p> <p>"If you want to go out or whatever again, I'm sure that we can work something out, but I don't think that we will have much time, if we're going any further. We'll work on it later. I'll call you tomorrow. And you, Honey, I hope we're not just friends."</p> <p>"Not at all, honey. I'm glad you called. We're just friends, but more importantly, I'm glad that we can be friends again. It's been, I don't know, the greatest thing that has ever happened to me in my entire life."</p> <p>We kissed again, and I went to bed, expecting to try and doze off as soon as I got into bed. I just had to wake up now, and was a little more than five hours into waking up. I was glad that I was able to finally feel all of the sensations I had been missing for a while, and that it hadn't been more than a day since I'd last had sex. I couldn't help myself, and I had to get up and take a shower before I left. I just sat there looking at the TV, not really seeing anything on. About an hour later, I was awakened by the sound of the shower running again, while I was getting dressed.
