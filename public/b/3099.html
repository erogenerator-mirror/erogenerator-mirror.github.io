She had been teasing him and now he knew. He didn't know if she was right but the longer this went on he would not be able to stop anymore. The thought of his cock slipping between her parted thighs made him groan and he couldn't help but slide inside her in one smooth motion. "Yes," he groaned thrusting into her with everything he had.</p> <p>"I'm glad you're not mad at me," she whispered in his ear as he fucked her.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>The following day, Jason spent in bed with his girlfriend. He had gone over to the girl's house twice to look at the property that he had been told they had. That afternoon, he had called in sick to work and decided to stay in town so he would not have to see her anymore. He had planned on seeing the property before he left. He was tempted to, but then again it was the same as always. Instead, he went to the property and left the letter on the car to hide the letter. He had even forgotten it had been mailed but found that in the car, his cell phone number was included. "I was going to email it to you at work, but it came yesterday," he mumbled to Jenny.</p> <p>"I'm sorry dear, but I promised my parents I wouldn't come to see you on a Saturday so you aren't the only one here. They will be there for the ball on Monday so it is a special day," she told him in the form of a smile. She had been waiting for him for awhile while he worked but knew she had been dreaming. His cock had been hard and hard as it always did whenever she saw it. Just hearing her words made him smile and once again, he was happy that Jenny had made the right decision at work. He would call her later then for sure, she made it clear on her own face that he would not like it but not to worry, just to remind him of his dream. He had been looking forward to having her out with him that day and what was sure to be a beautiful, young woman.</p> <p>He was tempted to put the letter with his name and send it to her but that idea left him confused. He had been thinking about it all afternoon and had decided to text her. He was really hoping that she wanted to see him that day.</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>It was a Saturday afternoon and he was not surprised when he got there to find Jenny in her cheerleading uniform. He had been able to pick up on the first note but as soon as he saw her she had already gotten dressed. Not only the cheerleading outfit but the school uniform too. She had put on a cheerleading cap and a white button down shirt with spaghetti straps that came down to the middle of her thighs. He wondered why she was still dressed when she made it up. She stood at 6'2" in her cheerleading shoes she wore a black plaid skirt and a white blouse that showed a lot of skin above her bra line. As always, with her hair pulled back and in a pony tail, she looked amazing. She looked like a teenager and just as sexy when she wasn't wearing high school uniform skirts.</p> <p>"Hello, Jason, nice game with all the cheerleading," she said while walking towards him. Her cheerleading skirt had ridden up her thighs so he knew that she wasn't wearing panties but he knew this would be important as it would show her thighs which he knew they couldn't hide. He could tell that she didn't wear panties under the skirt. He had just started with the letter when she grabbed his hand and pulled him aside. "I'm afraid, Jason, we can't go to school today. I'm sorry but my parents can't drive my car because my friends and I decided to be alone today and I have to have a ride in the back with my friends."</p> <p>"Do you know how long it has been since you got me this letter?" he asked trying not to let his tone bother him.</p> <p>"You are a strange one, you look confused and perhaps worried that I may not like what I'm reading but I have read that letters can be good and true. I have seen several letters with letters in them but this one was made of very light letters and these letters look real good."</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"They are made of light letters so they have a light look like real letters or can be used for words like letters or writing or just plain plain letters."</p> <p>"I wonder how many letters they hold?"</p> <p>"Yes, many but most are made of one letter like I have seen in some of the other letters." She smiled and looked over at him. "What?"</p> <p>"They're made of a light lightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
