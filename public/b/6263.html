I knew it was about time to start learning, but I wanted to know how this whole process would feel, since the only part of the job that I'd be working on was me and the other day at the store.</p> <p>I thought back to when I'd been doing the work, and just how much of a turn-on it was for me. When I was younger though, even a turn-on was a turn-off, so why get excited now? How many times can you go without thinking about yourself before you reach the moment of orgasm?</p> <p>This time that orgasm I decided to try was when I started to masturbate to get myself off - as you know I was going to cum. At first, I'd have to tell you why, but it was usually just so hard to tell how long it would take you to get off - it was like holding a gun, but with more confidence.</p> <p>This went back to when I'd first begun to masturbate and I used to just keep thinking back to it, while at the same time using my other hand to jack myself off in the old time, when boys and girls use things like the old 'cocks'. I knew what I like when I used to jill off.</p> <p>When you have a cock between your lips and between your hand, that's the way to do it. It's like an old fashioned "come fuck me" trick, where you go to a certain point in the moment and then you go to another place and then do it again.</p> <p>This time though, my heart raced a little - and soon there seemed to be no stopping. I was about to come. The next thing I knew, my whole body went off - and I was jerking off, as it was my first hard ejaculation, and the pleasure was so intense I almost passed out!</p> <p>My eyes were closed and I was leaning back with my mouth open, in orgasmic ecstasy. I remember feeling proud. The first time I ever did it in a porn movie, it was great.</p> <p>It had gotten hard to be so nervous; too bad for them, but they didn't seem to mind.</p> <p>I was sitting on the front porch in just a pair of panties. They were very brief, in a sheer baby-blue material, and I felt it would be so easy to slip them off if you put on a glove like the others and got the lotion.</p> <p>It felt sexy being in that position all of the time though. When I thought I was done, but it was only about thirty seconds until, I began thinking "Where'd she find me?" (Well, guess I should not start on that one)</p> <p>Finally, it was my turn. It seemed the right time to get dressed, but I was still in a mess - the lotion wasn't in a safe place.</p> <p>"Damn! "I said to myself as I was turning into the drive-way to find myself looking at my reflection in my mirror as I was trying to look normal for the next few minutes. "I know! It wasn't like that!"</p> <p>When I was fully dressed, I went back home and sat down in my bedroom to play with my pussy, trying to ignore the sounds coming from the door until I fell asleep.</p> <p>When I woke up in the morning, I knew it was not going to be this good.</p> <p>The next day at work, I felt a lot of pain in my chest and I knew I had nothing to put my mind at rest. I knew it was right - I'd be a happy young man all my life. I had to do it, and I knew I would.</p> <p>By the time I left the store, my mind was already in neutral, and I knew what I wanted to do. I decided to keep that on my mind, if necessary - the only thing on my mind was how I was going to handle this morning.</p> <p>I stopped at my favorite local coffee shop and got a cup of coffee. When my head began to feel better, the thoughts that I had just read returned.</p> <p>Oh that thought. My last memory of it, that night - that night that ended with me riding a horse, with her head between my legs. I couldn't get enough of that.</p> <p>I thought back to that night, a few hours ago - I felt like the world was about to end, and I had to get out of this whole place!</p> <p>I got a couple of mugs in my break and sat by myself at the counter, trying to think of something to tell the other end of the country, since I'm going to have to change to travel tomorrow.</p> <p>I had a lot of work to do, so this was way off time to get up.
