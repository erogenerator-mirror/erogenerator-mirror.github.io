I watched as I was suddenly pushed back into a corner.</p> <p>“Oh no, what have I done” came the thought.</p> <p>“Oh yeah, come on in” I said with a start, a few people walked past.</p> <p>I turned and let them in the door. I turned back towards Katie but as I got to the door I hesitated thinking how she was going to get the hell out of here and how far I was going to go but the next day I was going to ask her questions and not take any money for anything. I guess my brain was not working well in her current state. I knew she was about to do something with her life but for the first time in her life she was actually going to have sex with a stranger on a beach. Her voice was soft, I guess she could use it to get over this whole thing. I was so relieved I did not know what to do next but it was only moments.</p> <p>The second time it happened was just as it happened. She said the word love and then said it, in a voice that shook with emotions from fear to excitement and then everything at once. I was crushed I was going to have sex with another woman in front of them, and they seemed to love it. I could not think of anything else but the thought of Katie and her new friends. Finally it was over and I pulled open the door for Katie’s friends, I pulled out a pen and pad and asked them to keep an eye on the people that were coming.</p> <p>I looked at Katie as I wrote this one down, she seemed a little nervous and it felt like I had been holding something back at all the events of the day, all the excitement had seemed to go out the window. I guess I was looking for a reason to have sex and the fact that she had been in charge was not what I was looking for or at all. It was time now.</p> <p>As I walked out the door I wondered whether I should ring the doorbell or open the door myself. I had a very hard time deciding. I walked into the house and walked all the way up the stairs but stopped when I came to the room. The girls were standing on the other side of the door and I could see that Katie had gone to the bathroom. I walked in and the girls had removed their bottoms when I entered the room. They all smiled as I closed the door and closed the blind. I decided to wait for the other side, I walked around the room. I looked over the walls all around the room and there in the middle of it was a bed. I felt my dick stir under my shorts and pulled them off and walked over to the bed, leaning over Katie and kissing her so she could taste her juices for the second time. I grabbed Katie by the back of the head and pulled her face into my hard throbbing dick, I felt her hands grab as much of it as she could and she started to stroke it with her hands as I licked her juices off her wrist. She licked her wrist and sucked on my shaft making me crazy. She licked up and down my shaft making sure to have all of her wetness and then slowly started to lick my balls. I pulled her face away from my cock and pushed her back against the bed. She looked over her shoulder and smiled which drove me over the top. My fingers were working on her clit making her hot again, and I was going to come in her. She took my hand and placed my middle finger in her mouth then she put my wet finger in her own wet mouth.</p> <p>As my body was about to explode I pulled Katie down on the bed and lay her on her back with just the head of my cock in between her legs and started licking to her clit. With all the excitement of the day I was rock hard and my dick came in between her legs and slid in and out of her. Her pussy was soaking wet from what was happening and it felt amazing as I licked her clit and finger fucked her. I pulled out all the way and she gasped, saying that she had never done it this way. I pulled her legs apart and slid them up so she was sitting on them and started to fuck her faster. I was ready to come just from the sensation, her legs tightened around me and her mouth opened to scream out my name as she came violently. I felt her pussy contract around my dick, like a man possessed. I started to drive deeper into her as I could feel my own orgasm coming, I could feel it coming with such force that each thrust drove deeper and harder into her pussy.</p> <p>The whole time she was coming back, I could not tell—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
