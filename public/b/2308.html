It was time to show the girl how far she could go. She was right about her ability to orgasm, but I wasn't ready for it to be from a toy, so I pulled her close and kissed her. She tried to move away, but I pulled her back in, holding her firmly as my tongue penetrated her mouth. I sucked her tongue and nibbled it as my hand cupped her ass. I squeezed it and stroked it, kneading her ass roughly.</p> <p>Then all of a sudden, in a blur, I pulled away. I grabbed a towel, drenched it with soapy water and quickly washed her down. Then, I reached for the shampoo. I lathered up my hands and ran them through her hair. But there was nothing I could do about it, no matter how I tried.</p> <p>She gasped and whimpered, as she struggled to get out from under me. I grabbed her hair and pulled her down to my crotch. I couldn't get a foothold on the tile floor with her on top of me. I kissed her hard at the top of each thrust. She bucked up and down, as I was on top, as I was on top. Finally, I couldn't take it anymore. I lifted her up, and she wrapped her legs around my waist as I continued to pound her hard.</p> <p>She cried out at the sudden change of pace, as she started to lose control. I knew what she wanted, what it was that I was about to give. The look on her face was one of wanton frenzy as I continued to move her, my cock hitting the g-spot with each thrust. I didn't care about her, I was just able to fuck her for what seemed like forever. The feeling was indescribable. It was as if she were made to feel this intense pleasure, that orgasm, that intense pain. The feeling that was so strong she couldn't move any longer. Then I felt the warmth of my climax overtake her body, as I slammed her into the floor with the force of my thrusts.</p> <p>I held her steady, as she fell down below me, with me still on top. I let her sit before I rolled off to the side. She lay there like a limp rag doll, and I took my time picking up my clothes. I had to go to a bank to pick up my paycheck. And I wondered what that would do to my relationship. Could I live with someone who felt anything for me in the same way that I felt for her? Or possibly something that she didn't? But my thoughts were far different now. I couldn't find the courage to take that step and ask her, no matter how much she wanted it.</p> <p>I was exhausted, not by the weight of the world and my emotional commitment to her. But I was also a big girl and my world would fall apart if I didn't make it through the night. I would have to watch my daughter live her life without any kind of commitment.</p> <p>I was almost afraid to face her, but her tears kept trickling down her cheeks to hide the fact she was sobbing. I grabbed a pillow and wiped her face. Then I walked out the door, back to my empty house, in silence for a day or twoâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
