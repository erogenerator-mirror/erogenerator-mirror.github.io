I'm a big fan of my own and that's probably why I chose her; she's pretty and athletic, and she just seemed to work out. Still, she had great hips and a killer ass and she had great legs, which I'd guess are about as long but still nice-looking as hers.</p> <p>I just stared as she looked off to the side and looked in a corner of the room. She did indeed, look off to the side, and I saw what was going on. It was the guy with the beer keg.</p> <p>I didn't know what to do, even if she knew I was looking, so I left her to it. He's my type. He's tall, slim and about as athletic as I am, and he can be very intimidating if he takes his shirt off.</p> <p>He didn't have a real bulge from looking off to her, either; he just wasn't as large as I would have figured, but he was very nice looking, I must say, and didn't seem to be looking at her so much more than I was.</p> <p>I looked in our next room, as if I was going straight through the hall to where I was working the phone. The guy with the beer was now back and looked toward my room to make sure he didn't get too lucky. We still had a couple of minutes before the guy with his shirt on was going to start talking to her about something, but it was a good while.</p> <p>I think that it was just because of the way she was looking at him though, that I didn't get to see her for a while too. I had no idea what to say next. I was about to ask him what the hell was going on, when I heard her say "Hello", but then she said his next name and I think that she went to the other end of the hallway.</p> <p>I figured that she had just left, which would explain any trouble she could get into now with the next one.</p> <p>"Hello" she said again.</p> <p>It was obvious from the tone of her voice that she was looking at him, as her breathing was coming very quickly now.</p> <p>"I really can't tell you how happy I am to see you, " I finally managed to say.</p> <p>She was looking at me, a little apprehensively.</p> <p>"You're not going to answer me?" she asked.</p> <p>This was the biggest surprise I'd had in a long time. I should have suspected that if I really knew where she was, I'd have been able to find this room before she did, but what the hell, she was probably wondering who I was talking to and what her life would've been like if we ever had been alone together.</p> <p>"Of course there is." I said, "You're not really my type, and I know you've never had a girlfriend before I think."</p> <p>"A girl?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes" I said slowly. "A girl. We had some girl problems."</p> <p>I wasn't sure if I should have said "girl problems", because I didn't know she had an idea of how it was with other guys. In an area of our house, that she hadn't even known that she's gay.</p> <p>"A girl?" she asked again.</p> <p>"Well, my girl problems." I said slowly. "It's about time somebody told you what they were missing out on, and we don't have time now."</p> <p>She said nothing else but looked down, and then at me as if I wasn't even there, not even that she was looking at me.</p> <p>And then she just said "I can't tell you anything. Not a thing."</p> <p>"So, you aren't, uh, a girl?" I asked.</p> <p>This was getting really hot; in her condition, she would have had trouble staying calm. Was she even in the mood to tell me who she really was?</p> <p>"I'm not sure how to answer you." she said.</p> <p>"You don't know about yourself yet, but you've got the right girl's interest."</p> <p>She looked startled and didn't say anything so I continued. "Well, if you really want to know if I think you're really really good at it, I think you can just tell me your girl's name."</p> <p>"Oh, no" she replied. "Why don't you tell me yours? I don't think that would be very nice".</p> <p>She looked at me then, and really did mean it.</p> <p>"Well, I'm not sure what you mean, but it's OK. I'll just ask you to call me Jo."</p> <p>She looked surprised, but then she looked back up at me and I think that this girl really liked me.
