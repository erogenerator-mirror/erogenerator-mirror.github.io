"So...how do you feel about staying here?"</p> <p>"Yes, it's wonderful. It's actually rather cosmopolitan."</p> <p>"Well maybe one day we can have it right and move out here. You don't mind do you?"</p> <p>I just nodded not really sure what I was agreeing to. I hoped we could live here forever.</p> <p>"I've just got to run but will call you later. I'll talk to you later."</p> <p>I got up and grabbed my keys to leave. We had not finished what we had started.</p> <p>I had not really enjoyed our conversation. I was still somewhat hesitant to ask her her plans for the future but I was now starting to think that maybe this could be a good thing. She said,</p> <p>"No problem. I'll call you tomorrow and we can meet up again. I'd like to see what you do with your time if you want to come and visit."</p> <p>She was smiling like a young mother. I felt myself blushing.</p> <p>I said, "No, it's okay for me to go. It's not far. Let me call my family and they'll be happy to take me anytime."</p> <p>We went back to my room and spent the rest of the afternoon planning our move.</p> <p>She was now at home studying and it just took her less than 10 minutes to drop in the house. She told me that the boys would love it if I had a date as she called for him and he called for me. He took my number and agreed to be there for my date. A date! He told me he was very happy.</p> <p>I was still in nervous excitement. He told me that his parents had a new man-to-woman talk show scheduled for his place and his mom wanted to see what he looked like. I agreed to meet him and he took it upon himself to get rid of a date for me.</p> <p>He said that a girl was not allowed to wear pants unless in public. I agreed to this and he showed me. I was now in a small room with a light and had to make sure that he was there by himself.</p> <p>I felt so nervous about his date. He was a nice guy and he seemed very interesting. We spent about an hour on a date in which I found myself being extremely attracted to him. We decided to leave it at that.</p> <p>He asked me to pick him up that night and we went out to dinner and a movie. He picked me up at my house and we went dancing and I had a really hard time with the music. I was very aroused. We danced a lot and he made me feel good. He also brought me a lot of hot dates.</p> <p>I never really had a date; I had only met guys or girls at parties. He danced with me and got me really turned on. He was very handsome.</p> <p>After we danced his eyes were drawn to my boobs and I could feel his eyes on me. I was very aware that my boob was in full view and he knew exactly what to do with his eyes. After we dance he took me into his arms and started dancing with me. He asked me if he could get me an autograph.</p> <p>I told him that I would look. He gave me the autograph. It was very sexy looking. We did a lot of kissing and I felt very hot. He was very handsome.</p> <p>I asked him if I could feel his hard cock. He gave me a very hard cock and just looked me in the eyes with lust. I was so turned on.</p> <p>I told him I needed to fuck him and he said, "let's do it."</p> <p>He took a key from his wallet and told me to walk outside and we went to his car. He put my key into the ignition and we went out.</p> <p>He was very nervous but also very excited. We went in and I leaned against him and opened his pants. Then I slid them off his body and took out his cock which was just as hard as my friend's. I looked at it and he gasped. It was so swollen. He was beautiful!</p> <p>I stroked his shaft for a minute and brought my lips to his. He was very excited and pulled my head against his chest. Then he pulled me closer and kissed me hard. I felt his hand in my hair and my lips were all over his mouth. We made love for minutes.</p> <p>It felt so good to have my lips on his. We kissed as much as we could.</p> <p>We got home and I was a little apprehensive, feeling very turned on. I was afraid that he would be angry. I was not so sure of myselfâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
