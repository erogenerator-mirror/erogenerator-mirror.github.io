I’ve lost my baby and I had to be home for the wedding and the honeymoon.</p> <p>I was on my way back to the house myself. As I got on the highway it was a little weird for me to be wearing my jeans and a button down shirt as a bridesmaid. I could think of something else to wear, but I also had a dress rehearsal on, so I didn’t want to wear anything sexy. I got in and pulled out into the driveway and there wasn’t much to go after.</p> <p>I walked into the house, where I had set out my suitcase, and then looked around to see what sort of things I might need. I headed upstairs to freshen up and change for the wedding, which I had set up.</p> <p>In the bathroom I took my shower, and then slipped on a light blue strapless one that is a size too small. It’s the type that is easy to move through to sit on the shelf at the bottom of the mirror. Before I got out of the shower I took off the dress and put on my shoes. I put on the black dress with the hem down to three inches above the knee. I was going to give myself a little show for the front as I would be trying to make the front look sexy, but it felt funny being in front of my mom while wearing the dress I had left on for the day. Besides that, I like my mom more than a person and if the way she looked in the morning saw me dressed in the dress while standing in front of the mirror had turned her on, then I would not be surprised.</p> <p>I stepped out, my hair wet and my dress clinging to me. I started to put the dress on, and noticed that the zipper was a little crooked on the side of the dress. I picked up both the strapless dress and the bra and stepped into the front dress. I put the bra on with just the strapless, and then slipped a matching pair of panties on before putting the dress on.</p> <p>I did a quick check of the makeup and hair so that my hair wouldn’t be too heavy, but it wasn’t. I slipped into the dress and put on the shoes, before heading to my parent’s closet for the night.</p> <p>I knew it was a little after six as the wedding was still only a couple of hours away. So it was going to be another two hours before my parents were all seated. They made it look like we were all going to be there together.</p> <p>I took my bags downstairs and then got in the car and headed out the drive. It took me a bit of time to get to mom’s house but once I got to hers it didn’t take much to get there. It was a nice, somewhat seedy looking home that had a front yard and a nice looking front yard. The house reminded me of the house in movies and in my mind, the house that I had taken the night before.</p> <p>I walked into mom’s house from the top of the steps and found no one, just a few dishes that weren’t packed in the dish washer. I went to the bottom drawer and opened the drawer that contained all the things you would need for a honeymoon. The drawer also contained a variety of different panties.</p> <p>Once I found what I needed a moment later, I went back to moms bedroom to get my bag from the foot of the bed. My luggage was already in the dresser and I grabbed it to pick it up. I got down to my room and took my things into the bathroom.</p> <p>As I was checking out my luggage I noticed that my mother already had her back to me. She had her hand in her crotch and she was rubbing her pussy through the material of her dress.</p> <p>I walked over to her and put my arms around her, kissing her on the lips. I pulled her dress up so I could reach her tits with both hands and then moved my hands down so that each of my hands was wrapped around one of her ass. I moved one hand under her dress and pulled up her tight to me and squeezed her ass. "I missed you today daddy," she said, not even trying to pull away from me.</p> <p>"Honey, you know it. I’m home," I replied, trying to make light conversation.</p> <p>"I did too daddy. And when you go for the rest of the trip I’ll be naked around you."</p> <p>"You won’t. Your mother will see you without your dresses anymore." I was worried that she was going to take her dress off—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
