The two of us sat and smoked joints in silence, both of us feeling a bit sleepy. As we finished our joint our waiter asked, "Sir please, if you do not mind..."</p> <p>I looked at the handsome face that looked back at me and replied "Sure if I do not mind!" I took the bill and gave it to the man I had just met. He took it off of me and gave me another kiss and asked me to join him, I looked at him a bit puzzled and he winked at me. We sat in a nearby booth and he talked about his day as if he had known me all along and I felt a twinge in my pants. He had no idea whatsoever how I felt. I looked at him with a smile and said to him, "You are very handsome! I am not exactly sure what I would even think of your body, but maybe I would think that I have seen the best pair of jasmine covered pussies in the world!" I blushed, "And I am very much looking at you!" and laughed as he pulled the card out of my purse. As we both took our food, he handed me the credit card out his pocket and smiled like a kid who saw the next door street sign. I thanked him for inviting me to lunch, it was quite the change from the usual dull, bored lunch he usually had.</p> <p>When we got to our table, he ordered us to go to the park on the hill which is some distance away. We sat there in silence as we ate our sandwiches and laughed, finally we broke apart and headed home, he went to work for another hour or so and we agreed to meet again around 9pm. When we got home, I stripped off my clothes and jumped into the shower. I had been with a guy before and it usually felt very refreshing, I was getting turned on by the thought of being with a guy again. I thought nothing more of it and got my hair wet and brushed my hair in soft little movements to remove any tangles. The warm spray splashed across my body as I ran my hands over my body. I liked this feeling of finally having something to say to him that I wanted to do to each other but was hesitant to ask him. It was his time to make that decision, and it seemed that I really didn't want the encounter to be one where I had no choice.</p> <p>When I got out of the shower, he was sitting at the dining room table and I saw him looking at me for the first time that night, his eyebrows raised in surprise! "You like?" he asked. I could feel the nervousness from my earlier words, but it slowly eased as I felt my stomach tighten and suddenly felt like I had just met the man in the past. He was handsome! I was surprised by how attractive he looked, but was surprised too when he came up to me and hugged me, almost like he was waiting for something. I could feel the heat of his body through the thin wet robe and I felt my dick twitch in my pants. We had an awkward moment of silence after this moment of silent contact and his hands came up to mine with a smile on his face. He held me close to him and softly rubbed my shoulders and spoke in a voice that made my head spin.</p> <p>"My name is Tom and you are?"</p> <p>I said hesitantly, "I am Michael! I guess you just now have heard my name?"</p> <p>He nodded and said, "No idea!"</p> <p>I smiled nervously and said, "How do I look to you?"</p> <p>He nodded and grinned, "Well, as soon as my back got wet," he said, "Come on now!" and grabbed me and we hurried into the bedroom, I went to change into my clothes, I found a T-shirt that he had given me and pulled it on. He watched me while I changed in the mirror and I looked great dressed up with a nice dress that clung to me like a second skin. We made our way out and he sat down as soon as I came into view. He had changed into the same blue shirt, I put on a long white skirt with a low neckline that seemed to show a lot of cleavage when it came to my waist and I was wearing a pair of white heels. He grabbed me and I noticed that he also had changed into a T-shirt and some flip flop sandals. He sat down and looked at me for a moment and then his eyes ran over me looking up at me from time to time and he smiled as if he found something that he wanted and said, "So, my dears, do you think I would want to..."</p> <p>I smiled shyly at him and said, "I would think not!" I stood and walked towards him, "Please," Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
