I want to give you a massage."</p> <p>"I've never massaged a girl before."</p> <p>"Well, I'd be glad to give you a massage. It's not like I have any practice."</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess you're right, I thought they might be more professional."</p> <p>"Maybe they are. It's so peaceful."</p> <p>"Yeah, you need to relax. I'm just going to put a towel on my lap so you don't have to turn around."</p> <p>"No silly, I'm fine."</p> <p>He went to the bathroom and came back, handed me a towel and sat down on the bench.</p> <p>"You have on a nice dress. I like it."</p> <p>"It's okay. This feels a bit more professional."</p> <p>"You want me to start with a towel on your back?"</p> <p>"No, I want you to turn around."</p> <p>I do. He starts with the shoulders. He gets me so goose bumps appear. Then the back. The backside. He massages my buttocks, massaging my lower back. I'm so nervous and turned on, knowing I'm about to be fucked, but that he's just looking at my butt. He gets it all out before starting to press the towel on my lower legs. I guess he thinks it'll help me relax. He continues down to my butt and starts to massage my perineum. I feel it start to moisten and swell.</p> <p>"Wow," is all I can say.</p> <p>I hear a slight slurping sound. "Are you doing it?"</p> <p>"Um, it's okay."</p> <p>"You're fucking me, you're not making a sound," he says in between massaging my butt cheek.</p> <p>He turns me onto my back. I'm still holding my breasts. I feel the towel covering my upper body. He starts to rub my nipples. They feel good and his thumbs are rubbing in circles. He puts his other hand over top of my right breast. He lightly pinches both at the same time. I feel the towel moving as he rubs. I push my chest out to meet his touch. It feels good, better than the other way. His left hand continues moving up my stomach.</p> <p>"It's starting to feel good."</p> <p>"Um, I haven't made any progress here," I say.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, my touch is getting better."</p> <p>"Oh, okay. You don't have to do anything you don't want to. I'll just lay back like this and stretch."</p> <p>He moves my legs apart just a bit so there is room for his hands.</p> <p>"You can lean back more if you want to."</p> <p>"Thanks."</p> <p>I can't believe I said that. It was like the first time I said anything about my pussy or my butt. I was so nervous about what he was going to do. I felt like he was going to put his dick in me and really start with all the foreplay.</p> <p>He's now moving his hands up to my thighs and starts to rub them. He keeps himself still. He moves his thumbs up my legs. He gets them all the way up.</p> <p>"Why don't you get up a bit and lean back with your arms to your sides," he says to me.</p> <p>"That's good," I say.</p> <p>My heart's racing. He starts to work just one leg. I can feel it rubbing up and down. His thumbs working around my hole. I feel it twitching.</p> <p>"That's good," I say.</p> <p>"Are you sure you're okay?"</p> <p>"I'm fine."</p> <p>I feel the weight of his body sitting on my leg.</p> <p>"This is nice," he says, with his palms against my knees, almost like we are in a wrestling match.</p> <p>He puts his hands in my thighs and starts moving his thumbs back and forth. They're feeling incredible. He moves his hands up to my butt. He pulls my butt apart and works them back and forth. He gets himself lined up. I feel a finger run around my ass hole. I pull my back up until it slips in just a little. He slowly starts to run his hand up and down. He rubs the finger in little circles. I can feel the finger against my butt and the back of my butt hole. It's starting to feel good.</p> <p>"Can I just put it in?"</p> <p>"Yeah, that feels goodâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
