In a minute or two though, I want to taste you in your mouth."</p> <p>This new request made me more than a little nervous and a lot of questions were formed as he moved towards me, my arms sliding around him to try and hold him from falling. He stood back up and as I turned my head towards him, he slowly parted his lips and lightly dragged his tongue across them, savoring the taste. I parted my lips and slid them over his, and he gently put his hot, wet tongue into my mouth. He didn't move it away, but I could tell he wanted more. I returned the initiative and quickly placed the tip of my tongue on his, licking down and across his lips at the same moment. I could feel myself getting wetter as I felt another surge through his body. When he pulled away, I could tell he already had something in his mouth, he could barely get it out. I took that as a good sign and went back to what I had been waiting for, licking and kissing his lips and down to his neck, stopping here to lick his ear. He had a huge grin on his face as he finally opened his eyes and looked at me for a few moments before returning his attention to the task at hand. I put back to the ground floor kitchen and sat down on the couch, and just for a moment, we looked at each other as if we already knew the answer to that matter and just held each other as long as possible.</p> <p>I pulled his shirt over his head, and he quickly kicked off his boots and sat back down next to me. We sat in silence for a few moments and as his eyes began to fall into my lap, I quickly got off the couch as well. When our eyes met again, my heart was racing a hundred times a minute as I stared at him. He had a look of determination in his eyes and in a husky tone, I knew I was right to feel this way.</p> <p>"What do you have in mind?" I managed to breathe out.</p> <p>"I'm game if you are."</p> <p>I got up, pulled off my shirt, and stood there, my arms crossed over my chest and chest. I walked around me until I could kneel on the floor before him. He began to sit down on the couch and then moved forward so he could stand up. I followed him and slowly sat myself down on the opposite side of the couch next to him. "Stand up." he said softly. I complied, and then stood up again. When I was standing, he pulled down his pants and began to stand up as well. When he was standing upright, he took off his shoes and dropped them on the ground. His hands reached forward and began to unbuttoned my jeans and slipped them down over my hips. I stood up again as he removed his pants and let me sit down beside him.</p> <p>"Take off your shirt." he ordered. I leaned down and began to slide my shirt up and off. I looked at him to see the look of lust and pleasure on his face as he watched me strip. In a short time, I was standing in front of him in only my underwear and heels, my stomach fluttering as I slowly moved his pants down around his ankles. He lifted his hips slightly as I got down on my knees before him and began to pull his jeans all the way off. I slid my hands under his thighs but only got a glimpse of what I assumed would be a cock in his pants before he stood up and slid his briefs and pants off all together. I stood up, grabbed him by the hand, and led him back towards the kitchen. We sat down on the couch and he leaned back against the far side while I kissed him one more time before standing back up. He slowly took me by the hand and led me over to the kitchen table.</p> <p>"Take your pants off." he said again. I slowly unbuttoned my jeans and began to pull them off slowly, one by one. Once I had my pants on, he looked at me for a moment.</p> <p>"That's not going to do." he said. He began to take off his shirt and socks. I sat back down and began to get up on my knees, waiting for him to tell me where he wanted me to sit. When he didn't sit, I went back to sit on the corner of the table so I could get a good view. He put down his coffee and looked at me for a moment.</p> <p>"I like your legs." he said. I took my legs off and sat back down. He sat on one of the chairs and began to slowly remove his pants, pausing occasionally as we both could feel the anticipation of doing more than just removing his pants. Once they were off and he was wearing only his briefs, he pulled them down to hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
