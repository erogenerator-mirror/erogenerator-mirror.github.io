I needed to get off.</p> <p>"Ok, I'm ready now." I said in a rush.</p> <p>Naked, on all fours on my bed, my legs spread wide as I could, I turned and crawled over to him. He lay there for a few minutes, rubbing his hands softly over my body. It was so erotic. He started to stroke my breasts, and pinch hard nipples. I moaned from the attention and his slow methodical stroking. I could feel myself getting wet just from how turned on I was.</p> <p>He moved to my stomach. It felt so soft and felt so good. He ran a finger slowly, up between the cleft of my lips. With a deep moan, he pulled it back and moved it to my clit.</p> <p>"Oh god," I moaned at his soft touch. I lifted my hips so he could continue his teasing, and he circled over my little nub with his fingertip. I felt myself tingle as I had with Alex, wanting him. I looked down at his erection and reached for it. With a smile I licked it from head to base. I wanted more of what I had just received.</p> <p>"God you are so fucking wet," he told me as he rolled his fingers up my soaked crack. My orgasm was already building and building. Alex slipped a finger inside me as he continued to tease me. I pulled him into me with my hips.</p> <p>I felt a little bit of me juices, as his thick finger entered me. He pushed a second two fingers into me as I wrapped them around his shaft. I could feel him stretching me. He pumped his fingers in and out, as I pushed back into him. He began to fuck my pussy with his fingers, with my hands. I felt the tightness and friction increase.</p> <p>"Oh god," I screamed as my orgasm was building. He continued to finger me, as I rode out wave after wave in orgasm after wave. I felt my body flush red, and my knees were weak.</p> <p>"Don't stop," I moaned. "I want more."</p> <p>"Well," he smirked. "We probably could have another go with it!" he winked at me and moved between my legs.</p> <p>"Oh yes, please, please," I begged. "I need you inside me! I need you now! I need you right now!"</p> <p>"I can wait," he said with a playful smile. He put his hard cock back in me as he moved one hand down my front to stimulate my clit.</p> <p>"Oh please. You have to give me more," I begged. His fingers continued to play with me as he fucked me with his cock, as he licked me to another mind blowing orgasm.</p> <p>"Give me more," I was begging him, as my body began to convulse. "I want more!" I yelled.</p> <p>"Well," he said. "Here is how you repay me." He slowly licked over the end of his cock. Up and down, he teased but never took his fingers out of me as I convulsed in orgasm after orgasm.</p> <p>"Oh god, I want all of you," I screamed. He put his fingers in his mouth so I could taste myself again. I came again and again as he licked us clean. I felt like I was going to loose control. We lay still for a minute. He had his head on my stomach, and it felt so good to see his body close up to mine. I felt my breathing slow a little bit as I felt his fingers stroking me as he pulled away from me.</p> <p>He went over to me and put his head in my neck, but not on my side. He gently kissed it. He turned me over and lay me back. The sheet was covering me up. There was no other option in my mind. I laid there, and his cock was still in me. He wrapped his arm around me as one hand was stroking me. I could feel myself getting wet again, as I felt him getting hard again. He held me up as he slid the sheet off of me.</p> <p>There in his arms was his cock. It felt so good in me. As my hands and fingers stroked him, to feel him as he filled me just made me want him. I felt ready. I wanted to feel him inside of me. I wanted him to make love to me.</p> <p>I heard him moan at my touch. "Is this really what you wanted?" he asked. I just nodded. He began to gently massage my lower back. He rubbed my lower back and hips and ass, as his hand moved down further to my thighs. His fingers moved up and down my skin as his hand wentâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
