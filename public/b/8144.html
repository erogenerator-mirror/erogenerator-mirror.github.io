"He always said that I should be a good girl and not to be a slut." She ran into the back. "He said this was a nice place to raise a family and that I should do everything I could to make it, and then he laughed. And just then he came up with a new idea, and it was that we get together sometimes to get ourselves and others ready, just to check in on things, or we could watch TV together."</p> <p>"What kind of thing is it?" I asked, looking around. There was a table at one end of the house, with plenty of space for all of us.</p> <p>"You know exactly what I mean," the woman said. "I want you all to be comfortable. Your dad, your brother, you boys. I'll do anything I can to ensure it's all right for you all."</p> <p>"All right, Mom," my father said, coming up to me. He gave me an extra hug, then kissed my cheek. "We have everything we need to do today."</p> <p>"Yes sir," my mother said. She moved away, but she held out a hand to me. "My Dad, your father, it's all right. It's just...you can't keep a secret forever, can you?"</p> <p>My father nodded, as my mother said those words. I watched her move again, then I looked around the room. The room was furnished as it had been before, but I didn't know how it would be in the middle of the day, and at night, when Dad and his boys retired for the night, they would just go back and make love, but if the lights were off or the house would be empty, they would go to bed. In some places I even had the feeling that he might have sex before the lights came on. For other places, people would just be asleep when the lights came on. But somewhere in the middle of all this activity, I was feeling warm and alive again. And maybe that's why she did something that really had me feeling good, even when she didn't understand it.</p> <p>She took my hand, and led me to the table, which I had just moved onto. She got the table completely turned back, and then turned me around as she lowered her mouth towards my breasts. I couldn't believe how much I could feel her soft little mouth, but it didn't bother me. I leaned back against her, closed my eyes, and felt her lips and tongue work their magic on me and I felt my whole body come alive; like it never did the last time. My mother moved her mouth from my breasts down to my navel.</p> <p>Her mouth moved through it, taking my bellybutton into her mouth there, and then up and over it. She stopped and looked up at me. "Hmmm? Mmm?" She ran her tongue gently around my navel, then went back down, gently parting my pussy lips to look at me again. "Like what you see?" she asked.</p> <p>"Mmm...," I said, as she ran her tongue gently back and forth over my clit. That was all it took, and I was coming in her mouth. "Agh!" My hips jerked. "Ahh! Oh! Ah! Oh! Oh!" The sounds came out and I held onto all my strength to keep my hips still as my orgasm shook me. With my hands on the table, I looked deep into my mother's eyes.</p> <p>"That felt so good," she whispered. "Did you like it, Sweetie?" she asked, taking her hand from my thigh.</p> <p>"Yes!" I said, in her ear. "I...uhh...like it. I like it!"</p> <p>She grinned. "Hm-hmm. How 'bout we do that again sometime, like in the future?"</p> <p>"Definitely, Mom, definitely," I heard from her. "I've been ready to come for years...you might say, ever since I was a kid. Ever since you let your little boys have her..."</p> <p>"What?" she asked, raising her eyes. "You were in love with her, right?"</p> <p>"...Yes."</p> <p>"Then we'll have to make a lot of other plans," she said, and I could see she was smiling. "In the future," she added, "we'll go out every chance we get."</p> <p>"And you'll give me a hand?" my father asked, smiling at her.</p> <p>"No, sweetie," she said with a shrug. "I'm not a very experienced woman, and I don't do what boys are after, that's all." Then she grinned again. "Oh, you're getting old, Sweetheart," she said with a wry smile.
