I won't lie to you."</p> <p>I felt his body tense. He put his hands on my shoulder and pushed me forward. His chest was pressed against mine on the table, his face pressing into my neck. There was nothing he could do but hold me as he came.</p> <p>After a little more kissing, he pulled himself back and wiped the hair from my face and he turned me around. This time he laid face down with me. He held the cheeks of my butt in his hands. I felt his weight shift on top of me. He kissed my neck and his hands moved from my lower back to my hips and back again, then back down again. He pressed my bottom back against his cock and it slipped in between my cheeks and into my crack. I groaned at the sensation. He turned me around on the table again. He held my hips, which were pressed against my legs. He kissed my neck, which he held open for me. As he held on to my hips, I felt his erect penis sliding along my crevice. He pressed the head of his penis against my opening. It didn't want to penetrate. I took a deep breath, he smiled at me. And he pushed it in. It's so warm and hard.</p> <p>He held my hips at a comfortable angle. The tip of his penis went between my cheeks and through my crack. I felt empty. He kept pushing and moving. My body felt like jelly. My head hung with his mouth. I moaned loudly. With all his weight he pushed me forward. He kissed me again. And then he moved a bit. His penis seemed to slip inside my canal. I whimpered and his hands tightened on my hips. His head popped around my entrance. He was inside me. We both groaned loudly. I was glad for him, even though the idea of it was scary. I wanted him to fuck me. I wanted him to make love to me like that.</p> <p>He was very careful. He slipped the full length of his erection into me at first. He stopped there and made the most of the penetration. He kissed me again and pushed into a bit more. When he came forward again, I felt the pressure of my body against his. He kissed me a little more. I kissed him back. His penis slid a little deeper in my canal. It felt good to me as he filled me up. It was good for me too. I started moaning. His head was in the middle of my chest and his body pressed against me.</p> <p>"I love you," I whispered as I wrapped my arms around his back. The feeling was incredible. He held onto me again and kissed my neck.</p> <p>I turned and kissed his cheek. "I love you, too," I told him. He pushed his hips up and out. He put his hands under my butt and lifted me up. My legs wrapped around his body. Slowly, his penis pushed its way into my wet canal. This time, he slid into my depths without moving. I moaned, feeling his penis slide between my legs until it was completely inside my vagina. He lifted himself off me at the same time. This time instead of pushing himself in, he reached a hand over my mouth. I let him kiss me on my lips. After a few minutes, he pushed himself in a bit more. I gasped. He was still very slow with me. I was surprised because my body didn't quite reach this point. But when he pulled almost all the way out, it felt like he was going to pull back until his penis was completely out. But he kept the tip of his penis inside me until I moaned and opened my mouth again. I took his head in my mouth and he started thrusting. I loved it. The feeling between me and him was intense. The head of his penis was sooo soft and wet. He was fucking me with his penis. But he knew when to stop. He kept pushing his penis into me, and he knew when to take me.</p> <p>We were in a rhythm of his thrusting inside me. After a while, we stopped. I kissed his neck. He kept thrusting into me slowly. When he went slightly further, my body tightened some. He was thrusting harder now. He got a bit faster, and he was feeling me tighter around his penis. He held my hips in his hands as he thrust into me. He was almost pulling out of me completely. I wanted to tell him to hurry; he was so hard.</p> <p>I kissed him again and I was crying a little. I felt he orgasm inside me. And I wanted to feel him inside me at the same time. He started panting. He kissed me again. "I'm going to cum," he whispered.</p> <p>"Yes," I whispered back. "Cum inside me with meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
