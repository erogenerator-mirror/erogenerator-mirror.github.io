It's your turn now."</p> <p>"Ok babe." She got out of the shower and I took a step back. She was right on top of me, wrapping me up in her arms. Our mouths were just inches apart as we kissed a quick kiss.</p> <p>"I'll never forget this. I have to tell you I never imagined in a million years just how much this would change me. This is probably the last chance I'll get to do this with a man. It scares me but I can't say I don't feel what I've always felt but just now, we need to know who you can be after that first experience."</p> <p>She kissed me lightly on the lips and I kissed her back again, running my hands up and down her back as we laid there on the couch kissing.</p> <p>"I've been with you before, and it's definitely one of the best experiences of my life. I want you so much. Do you want me to tell you about what it's like? Will you give me a chance to meet your first real female partner?"</p> <p>I knew how to get her to talk, so I said, "Tell me what to do?"</p> <p>"Come inside me, babe." She whispered.</p> <p>I wrapped my arms around her and we kissed again, long passionate kisses, but not trying to rush it. My hands were trembling as I slowly lowered her to the floor.</p> <p>"I'm sorry. I can't believe I'm doing this. This can't be happening." She said softly.</p> <p>I knelt between her legs and put her feet on my shoulders. My heart raced as I moved closer to slip the tip of my cock to her wet lips. She wrapped her legs around me, her small hands cupping her breasts and she lifted her hips.</p> <p>"God, you are going to make me cum so hard!" she exclaimed.</p> <p>"Don't worry. I'll start and you can cum down when you're ready."</p> <p>I slowly pulled my hard cock into her and the head of it was still inside her. She started to raise her hips to me, but I quickly raised my mouth. My mouth opened like a flower and her lips came in contact with mine. We kissed again, and I slid my cock from her wetness and sank it to the hilt into her.</p> <p>My head came to a stop, as it hit bottom. I could feel her muscles squeezing me and it sent an electric jolt of pleasure straight to my balls. She squeezed me even more. We started to work our hips back and forth as I started to pick up the pace. I couldn't stop my cock from slipping in and out of her juicy pussy. She was so wet and so tight. When it was going in that I couldn't go any faster. I felt like I was in a constant stream. It was driving me over the edge.</p> <p>"Take me inside you," I begged a few minutes later.</p> <p>She wrapped her legs around me, and I leaned against her. I felt her hands slide up to my chest and hold my arms out to the side. Our hands had been busy as much as our hips were. She felt good to me. I kissed the top of her head, then the side and to her neck. All the while we were kissing it was as if our souls were moving a million miles. We were making love, not fucking, between the only two of us. If we didn't stop we'd make sure my cock never left her tight pussy.</p> <p>I didn't have to tell her when our bodies had just melted together and that I loved her. She'd just given me a real first experience to remember.</p> <p>We lay there together, kissing gently. I couldn't get up much higher than where I am right now. As we kissed again and gently began to kiss again, her hands rested on my chest and her pelvis started to raise in arousal. I wanted to feel her bottom and move up and down, but I had other plans for our relationship.</p> <p>My hands came up and I gently caressed her neck. Her back began to arch, thrusting her breasts toward me. I slowly moved my hands down her slender shoulders and cupped her perfect breasts. My hands rubbed on her nipples and as the feeling grew I moved down to her belly. My fingers began to make their way downward, my fingers brushed her bare skin while kissing her neckline, leaving their mark for once. Her whole body felt as smooth as silk...she was so sexy...I wanted nothing more than to be inside her.</p> <p>My hand was on her bottom now...my whole hand. I could feel her quivering as my hand rested on her body. I couldn't help myself....my entire body wanted to be touching my goddess. I couldn't believe how wet I was getting and how my erectionâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
