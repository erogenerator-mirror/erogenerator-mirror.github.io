"Sara."</p> <p>Sara didn't say anything. She watched his eyes and body. It was strange. That he wasn't angry or angry with her. That she would think she had to obey him. Like he asked.</p> <p>"So," he said and pulled her into his strong arms. "I have something to tell you, Sara."</p> <p>"Why?" she whispered. "Why do you need to know the rest of my story?"</p> <p>"If that's the way you want to tell it, then go ahead."</p> <p>"What?" she sighed. "I can't tell it to you."</p> <p>"Yes indeed." He didn't bother to look her over, instead looking straight ahead. "Tell me what happened when you went home last night."</p> <p>"I-I don't know?" Sara felt herself flushing. "What's going on?"</p> <p>In an ironic tone that she could never have imagined, he said, "It's really none of my business."</p> <p>Sara just stood there. The word "don't" hung between them.</p> <p>"Why do you need to know the rest of my story?" he said quietly. "It's better if you don't know and don't remember."</p> <p>"But," Sara stammered.</p> <p>She could hear his voice. It was deep and very matter-of-fact. He could almost hear her voice. "Because I want you to know. And I need to know."</p> <p>The expression on his face said, "It's alright. You don't even have to ask."</p> <p>Sara turned away from him and made for the door.</p> <p>He grabbed the bottom of her t-shirt and pulled it up and off. "We don't have to do this," he said with a touch of anger in his voice. "I want to do this because I trust you with my life."</p> <p>Sara didn't know what to say. She couldn't believe this man could love her so deeply. How could he? Who would understand? She had felt the same way as her own parents had done. If she told this man that she loved him now he would be sure to ask why he had kept it secret from her. She hadn't meant to get upset, but this man really did love her.</p> <p>"I love you and I love this room. So I guess this makes sense," he said as he pulled her through the curtain to sit at the edge of the bed and lean back.</p> <p>As he wrapped his arm around her and pulled her toward him so they were face to face, Sara said nothing. If she said anything, he would just take an angry face. She didn't want to be hurt.</p> <p>"What about yesterday," he said quietly.</p> <p>Sara hesitated, knowing she should have said something. She knew there were more questions he had to ask. She was scared, and angry all at once, but also very much aroused, and it excited her to think about him doing this to her. She wanted to know more.</p> <p>"I loved the way you talked to me before you got married. I wanted to know why you did it, why you treated me like a queen. Now I have to decide how I feel about this. What is it that you want?"</p> <p>Sara didn't know what to say. Did he see how angry she was? Did it turn him on? It wouldn't be just about sex. What if he asked about her job? But for now, she didn't know what to do. She didn't know how to get past her feelings for him. It would take time.</p> <p>"I know how this feels like," he said and took her hand. "It feels so wrong. And you could never know what it means to you that way. But it feels right. And maybe we can do something like this again and again and again. And we can share our feelings with each other, that is all." He pulled her close and kissed her passionately.</p> <p>They were both trembling. Sara knew that wasn't good. She was scared. She wanted to go the rest of the evening and find out what happened, but she didn't. He seemed all too sincere.</p> <p>"Sara" he said. "I don't just want you to know about it, I want to go ahead and tell you the whole story."</p> <p>Sara didn't know what to say. "I don't know," she said softly. "It's not too far."</p> <p>"Not too far? In that case, I don't see any reason not to," he said and took her hand again. "I wanted to tell you before you knew what you were missingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
