She thought to herself.</p> <p>'Who knew? It was so weird.' It had been one of those things that happened with sex and it really wasn't a good idea. We were fucking each and every day but she was going through a phase of sexual frustration and she hadn't been able to fully accept her new sexuality. Now that she had started working at the shop it was almost time for her to move out again. And I was worried that the next time I saw her she might feel uncomfortable or hesitant that she wasn't ready for sex.</p> <p>'You could just move in. You have a flat on your own at the end of the block.' I assured her.</p> <p>'I'm sorry but I just can't. I need space.' She said but it was too late. I had heard the words at the time but I wasn't sure if they were true or not. I knew that I wasn't in the right position but I didn't want her to think I meant anything to her. So a long and sleepless night was my only solution to this mess. I knew she wanted more but a part of me was feeling sorry for her and her new status in the company.</p> <p>'Why don't I take you into the next month?' I suggested and as she gave me that look I knew I would do it.</p> <p>I really had no experience in doing this but I knew this would get my career in gear, so I thought of a way to get her back.</p> <p>'I mean your boss. I'm sorry you have to have that big a job but you are welcome there, I just can't say it." She was giving me that look again.</p> <p>"I've heard of a few women who have taken you out for drinks and if you are anything like them I wouldn't mind."</p> <p>'I've come to realise now that it was a lot of money that got me to ask and you do that for those that you care about. It was an insurance policy though and I don't want it to come round to an awkward end." I told her.</p> <p>'No it doesn't and I'll give you the job, but I'm not sure I'm going to let you fuck in the shop.'</p> <p>I was surprised that her voice could be so commanding and direct and she hadn't even been in the shop when I had left but I was pleased that it seemed to me as if it was just from her.</p> <p>'I wouldn't mind fucking in the shop.' I thought to myself.</p> <p>'You can come in to get your coat if you like, but I'd like to see how you do.' I said not saying a word about the coat. She made no move to take it off and I was about to turn around to leave when she grabbed my arm again and dragged me to the bedroom.</p> <p>'Get out of those dirty clothes.' She told me in the tone that one of us knew meant no more.</p> <p>I put my shorts on the coat rack and then helped her pull my tee shirt on over them</p> <p>'I've given you plenty of chances before but I really think today will be no exception.' She was standing there with just her bra on. She threw the top down and her full breasts flopped out a good six inches and I still couldn't believe what I was seeing. I was really turned on at having a woman just a size smaller.</p> <p>'I think I can get you inside once we get into bed.' She said, leading me to the bedroom.</p> <p>'I think I'll go along with that.' I told her and she walked me out of the bar leaving me with a bulge through my jeans which I had pulled down. She had to be a 40 year old, but she was also attractive. She sat me on the bed and then sat on the edge.</p> <p>'Undo my bra, it's time for your lesson.' She said as she took her bra off. It seemed so casual, as if she was not in control and that I could do whatever I wanted. She put a good foot on the bed and parted the waist belt, then pulled her jeans all the way off and then turned around to get another pair on. It was then that I got the picture. She didn't have anything under her bra though and her breasts were beautiful with lovely hard brown nipples pointing sharply upwards. I had never seen her like this, I watched her slowly striping her clothes off over her head and the expression on her face as she turned to look at herself in the mirror. After she had gotten naked she turned towards me and then slowly peeled off the remaining layer of her clothing. She was now fully naked and I could see her nipples were pointing downwards against her skin which made it look as if it would make them all rise up again. She turned back roundâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
