The opening was thick, the girth and texture of him was enormous, and there was a tremendous pressure on her clit.</p> <p>"Please Mr. Wilson, I have never..." she looked up with pleading eyes.</p> <p>He kissed her and said: "I'm ready."</p> <p>"Please! Put it in me!"</p> <p>He pushed in more easily this time, and felt her cunt stretch around his cock. Her pussy seemed to grasp him, gripping him like one hungry hand.</p> <p>As the pressure of his body moved over her, her cunt clapped against him firmly, and her breasts began to shake with excitement. It was so strange to be in the middle of something so beautiful, it felt like a thousand tiny orgasms, and the feeling was exquisite, but it was almost as if she were cumming and cumming in slow motion. He pushed into her cunt in slow motion as her body convulsed all over him, a series of minor orgasms as each one seemed to rush closer to the surface and on the verge of crashing down on him. He felt as though he was falling to the floor, and she was lifting him up with the power of her orgasm all over again.</p> <p>He knew that they had to fuck hard somehow, and he could sense some urgency in her body now. He could feel the contractions of her cunt through his cock, she was clamping and releasing hard over and over again on him as an intense orgasm slammed through her. He looked at her face as her eyes widened out of control, her mouth opened in a silent scream as it felt as if it was coming from inside her whole body.</p> <p>He slowly moved his hips in sync with hers as each wave seemed to travel all the way up his body to his cock. Again, it seemed to rush along his body in slow motion, the contractions seeming to draw them farther forward then normal, their mutual pleasure seemed to be building up, slowly, inexorably. His mouth came open and he felt his head go limp as his weight settled on top of her.</p> <p>"Oh GOD!" he was startled when her body began to quiver. He felt as if he had gone from being a gentle lover to being one to be a giant of a man. He felt as if his entire being was being pulled outward and in on itself with every twitch and jerk. He began to kiss her face again as she began to come down, but his weight was taking over to lift her entirely off his cock, so that she could finally relax. Their tongues were intertwined, as they both let out a long sigh as they drifted off to sleep with the sounds of his cock slowly coming out of her cunt.</p> <p>The sunlight, bright against the heavy curtains, filled the room. He felt his cock going softer and smaller inside her now, his weight being forced upward. He knew he probably couldn't fuck her anymore, but after what he had given her he felt as though his cock had taken care of it. She was as tight as a well trained dog, he felt as if he could easily pound her in mid-air, and she was moaning constantly as her body reacted to his. He could feel that she was so aroused from their bodies slapping together that if she were to keep her arms around him this way, he feared that his cock would be too tender to take again, but her whole body seemed to take on the feel of it, it was as though it were taking control, just the sensation of a single cock touching her made her body respond even more, the muscles of her stomach squeezing hard on his cock, and it was all too much for him to withstand.</p> <p>They lay their bodies close together now, his cock still inside her, his arms still around her. He didn't know what he would do. He felt as though he might want to throw her on the floor and fuck her as if the first thing he had ever felt before, or ever did. His cock felt as though it might never be the same again, as if he would need to cum to do it. He could feel that he was going to explode inside if he didn't fuck her now.</p> <p>"Did you just cum Mr. Wilson?"</p> <p>"Uh huh!"</p> <p>"I am so fucking horny I couldn't help it Mr. Wilson, I couldn't help myself from being so damn turned on. You really have a beautiful cock, I can't imagine any woman would take it all that fast, I just wanted to touch you, I'm going to make love to you."</p> <p>"G...h...help me," he mumbled. "I...need...to pee," he managed to say before his cock began to fade.</p> <p>"Oh you can go then. I'll get you something to drink to help take your mind off your cock."</p> <p>He feltâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
