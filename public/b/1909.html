One of my favorite scenes, of course, was the girl tied to a long, thick, black leather strap which I had just finished tying up with several different knots to each nipple. I had her in the middle of the room and it was hard to stay focused at the scenes. I tied her upper arms, thighs, and belly with thick ropes and attached them to the rings in the ceiling above her. One of the ropes held the top of her head up and was fastened behind her neck as I continued to tease her with my hands and the fingers of my left hand. The other ropes went around her thigh and her belly, one going from her belly button up to her midsection. I didn't know if it was too much rope or not but I let it go. It looked like she was going to have an orgasm right there in front of everyone in the room. That was a big turning point for me. What if somebody walked in and found somebody tied up in front of me on the floor.</p> <p>It had the potential to be a lot more erotic or it could end in some very unpleasant situations. She couldn't stop her.</p> <p>After she came, I stood up and unbuttoned my pants and freed myself. She looked away for a second and then her eyes went back to what she was doing with her hands, which were still bound above her. The look had me hard, I was sure. It was a look I'd never get tired of seeing. Now they were there, in clear view of everyone but my hard, long cock. How could I keep my pants on in front of such a large crowd of people.</p> <p>Now she looked toward her wrist.</p> <p>"Don't touch me," I told her.</p> <p>"Don't you want to fuck me?" she asked and her eyes never left my rigid, swollen cock.</p> <p>"No. Not in front of everybody who saw me, just in front of you."</p> <p>"Can't I touch myself in front of all the people, too," she asked me.</p> <p>"You can touch yourself anywhere you want...just don't touch me."</p> <p>She smiled and came back to the task. She grabbed my hand and helped me to stand upright again. I think by the way she held it the first few moments it looked like she liked it because we soon had a rhythm going. She kept her eyes on my cock as she rubbed it through my pants. Her hips rotated slightly when she moved her legs apart and her arms jerked her belly and I felt the beginnings of a large orgasm coming again. She came again, but this time it was even bigger than the previous ones.</p> <p>Afterward, she asked if I enjoyed the bondage. I was surprised but my cock was still throbbing. She got off the sofa and went to her room and came out some minutes later dressed in an outfit I didn't see her wearing just before she came into the kitchen.</p> <p>It was a short, tight skirt, sleeveless, blouse, and jacket with a white button down collar and black bowtie on her. Her bare shoulders and arms showed as I noticed her braless boobs. I was mesmerized by her beauty.</p> <p>"Do you know this outfit you put on that first night?" she asked.</p> <p>I nodded and she continued.</p> <p>"I had to look for some place to go without clothes. In the meantime I'd like to see it more. Take me for a walk," she suggested.</p> <p>She went to a corner where there was a big swing-shaped swing just like the one I saw her wearing at the party. I followed her outside to a low walled door that we went through while watching the scene on the floor. We were in the back yard of the house.</p> <p>"This place doesn't have privacy at the front, but it does," I said. "It's a way to be close to everyone. We could look at each other and it would be too obvious, but if we were to walk outside at any time...we'd have a whole audience going back to the party."</p> <p>She smiled and nodded, putting her head on her hands and swinging her hips and letting me look.</p> <p>After two miles she came to a corner where I could see the light of the house and the lights from the windows.</p> <p>"I want to walk right through the room," she said. "In case you're wondering."</p> <p>"Do you want everyone walking in and then outside? No clothes or privacy here, at least that we know of. We'd be in good shape."</p> <p>"Perfectly," she said. "I like walking through a room naked.
