I was asleep a few seconds before she was ready to climb out of bed.</p> <p>We had a great party, the alcohol flowing and the party was fun, especially during the summer, when the guys got a bit older, and she got into heavy partying. As far as I knew, neither of us was dating, but I didn't really know her very well, so I just decided to get out of it. I started to think I'd been drunk enough for her. I'd met her at a party a couple times, and that's how it got started. We got to talking and it turned out to be something like that when it came to my girlfriend.</p> <p>My idea of getting together in person was one of my friends from college, Matt. He and I started talking a lot on the phone a few times, and I thought I had found her an ex at the bar. The girl at the party got the name, I was introduced as Tom, a friend of hers from college. I was trying to impress her, I was trying to make her feel good about herself, because as it turned out, she wasn't all that happy anymore.</p> <p>At first, she didn't like the guy but then he asked if she liked him.</p> <p>She told him, "I don't. I don't know why you'd do something like that."</p> <p>"A lot of girls like to. They like to have a guy they like. I just think it should be my turn to have a guy, so I don't say I'm looking for someone to fill that role. It's the guy, and I'm the girl."</p> <p>I just had no idea how to go about it. It might be my turn.</p> <p>That would work. I was going to try. It might even make me feel better. Maybe it would just make my mind go back to when things had been so bad back then. But then, he said, "I was thinking that you would find yourself a guy... like the other night, so I said we would meet. What do you think?"</p> <p>She didn't respond at first, but said, "Do you know what I think?"</p> <p>"Of course," I said, "I've seen that look in your eyes the last several months. I don't want to ruin it by suggesting it, but there's just something about you. I would just hope it was what you wanted. The way you look at me."</p> <p>"Why?" she whispered to me.</p> <p>"I just like how we look at each other," I said, "and if we like each other then we'd be cool." I could feel my heart beating faster. "We can have fun!" I could see that she was still nervous around her man, probably because she had said the wrong thing. "Just remember to be honest with each other about everything. Are we like friends or what?"</p> <p>"Oh Matt," she said, "no thanks, just friends. I'm not going to do anything you don't want me to." I saw her smile and she was happy about what that meant. We had been friends all of our lives.</p> <p>"Come on, let's get you cleaned up, and ready to go?"</p> <p>She didn't say anything about it, she just took my hand and began to walk towards the door. I followed her, admiring her round rear as we walked. It was the one reason I was dating her so soon. I just wanted to be with her. I was feeling like a teenager again after the troubles that had been going on in our lives. It was the first time I'd felt such guilt in a long while and here I was having a good time with the girl of my lifetime, and I had no regrets about the past... no feelings of guilt. I knew that I was going to give her the time of her life. And no, no regrets from a good-bye. No regrets on our part of what we had felt like for years. That was what had made us good friends during our college days.</p> <p>We got to the car after her shower and she was getting ready to go. She put on her jeans and a t-shirt and then her jacket as she went to the bathroom. When she was in the bathroom, she took a bath towel and wrapped it around her body, not that it bothered me.</p> <p>"You don't mind if I join you?" I asked her, "You have to wear a jacket."</p> <p>"No..." she said, "It's alright. I guess if that's the way you'd prefer to hang out with me, I guess thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
