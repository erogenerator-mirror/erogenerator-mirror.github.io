We'll have some dessert."</p> <p>The door clicked closed. I was so nervous that I could practically hear the click-click-click-click-click of the keycard going off while I watched Julia walk away. I stood there for a moment just listening to her speak in her normal cheerful tone. I tried to find out what her husband knew or suspected or where he had gone. The whole thing was so surreal. I really wanted to touch myself but for once I stopped myself and just stood back while still listening to Julia. The silence was deafening. With my cock so hard and wet I thought I might faint a bit.</p> <p>Julia finally went out the door. I wondered if she had forgotten there was a camera in there somewhere and had gone upstairs that night to use it to record audio in case I came home and caught her. I couldn't get over the complete situation. I was so embarrassed and yet so aroused; I could barely contain my excitement. I heard the door open and then close and the sound of her steps on the stairs. My breath was coming in short gasps.</p> <p>Julia was standing in front of the bathroom mirror with the door partially closed. She was washing off her face, combing her hair back with her hand. As a matter of fact, she was trying to get as much of her face and neck as possible into the mirror, while she looked in the mirror again. In her arms, she was holding the towel in front of her, brushing her hair down her neck. I could tell she had a slight smile on her lips as she combed her fingers through her hair.</p> <p>"Do you know where I went?"</p> <p>"Yes," I whispered. I wasn't sure if this was the right answer or not. If she didn't want to be caught, how did he react? I decided that if he was in a situation like this, he probably did know, even if the fact he didn't seem to mind at all. I waited for a few minutes and then decided to go upstairs and pretend to go to my room to jerk off like a teenager. I thought about how much I loved holding those tight handfuls of tissue between my fingers; how much I wanted to do so many things to the tissue. Even if Julia had been watching, I was sure I would have cum before she had even gotten the door closedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
