She responded. "You've done this before. You are so smart!" she said, not moving her eyes from my own.</p> <p>"Good. I like the variety." I said. "I like a variety. That's what we do." and then I was on my way towards Lauren who was already sitting there, legs crossed and staring in rapte as I finished dressing myself.</p> <p>"I'm sorry!" she said, as I turned to walk over and start putting my clothes on. "I hope you aren't mad at me! I think you're making a habit of watching me and..." she paused.</p> <p>"I don't blame you for being so beautiful!" I said. Looking down I saw the most intense smile that I've ever seen from her.</p> <p>"I liked that," she said. "You and I have done that before."</p> <p>I laughed. "I've been watching you for three days. I'm not sure you'd want to do it again." I laughed. "That's not what I meant!"</p> <p>"Oh yes you were saying." she said. "But I thought we should both go. I don't want to get caught." It was one of those conversations in which you just know that you're going to have to do something, which in fact, is very hard for a first time to do. "You can't be serious you know, about this place! We can't go. I am sure it's against everything I've ever wanted to do and I'm sure you've also never had this happen before."</p> <p>"No, we've done this before. But I don't want to stop now. If we do this we won't be doing this every day." my words seemed to make her sad and she took my hand in hers. "You've got every part of me that I could ever want!" she said softly.</p> <p>"What?" I asked. "What part was the most sensitive part of you?" I asked and she pulled me up to give me a long passionate kiss.</p> <p>"Oh! Your dick. I wanted yours that morning!" she said and I felt her fingers trail up and down my back, then she pulled my shirt down and undid my belt. She slid a finger into my slit and I was already excited. "Do you want to try to cum again?" she asked.</p> <p>"Sure!" I said. "How about if we do it one more time!" She reached into her purse and pulled out a condom and a condom package. "Then I'll be there!" she said as she slid the condom on and stepped on the bed to give me room to change places.</p> <p>I looked in her direction as she rolled the condom onto my now throbbing erection. "I'll come back and have you do something else later!" I said eagerly.</p> <p>She rolled the condom down over the tip of my penis and I watched as she stepped back down off the bed and took my hand. "Come on, time's up." she said softly as we walked towards the door.</p> <p>"You don't need anymore!" I said and we paused in front of the exit and she took my hand. "Come on," she said.</p> <p>We moved through the door of our apartment and as I watched as we walked, the light was starting to fade. I walked around behind she and she rested her hands on my chest as I reached out and slipped my finger into her. She moaned softly and closed her eyes. "This is nice!" she exclaimed. Taking my other hand, she took my cock and guided it into her waiting, sowined vagina.</p> <p>"Ah, yes!" I yelled as she started pounding on my own erection. "Oh, it feels good!" she exclaimed and her body shivered and my own hand was coated with her juice. "I'm cumming!" she said urgently.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah!" I shouted and she cried out, "Oh, my sweet god!" Her body shuddered as my erection shot load after load of spunk into her twitching pussy. I wrapped my arms around her body as we gasped for breath. The last pulse of my energy hit her as she collapsed on me with her arms locked behind me.</p> <p>I gently pulled my fingers from her body and she leaned her head back. "That felt...so...damn good!" she said as my own hands slid from her body to her hips.</p> <p>"I'm not sure that I'll go again," I said. "It might be the start!"</p> <p>"Well, it's not," she said as she gently rolled off of me. "Let's go get cleaned up and then I want to take you in my mouth!"</p> <p>"Oh, you don't have to have me in your mouth," I said, taking her hand. "I'll hold still a little longerâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
