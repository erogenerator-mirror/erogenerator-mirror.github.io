"She's not coming back," he said, opening the door for me. "What's she doing here?"</p> <p>"I don't know. She works at The Office."</p> <p>"You mean she'll be on her way to work."</p> <p>"Not for a while. She's staying over at my place. Why."</p> <p>"Well, you can sleep in the guest bedroom."</p> <p>"But— but, I don't want to leave her alone."</p> <p>Kurt shrugged. "I don't understand. I think she's tired. She had more than her fair share of boyfriends over the last couple of months and she's probably in trouble."</p> <p>He turned abruptly and looked at the door, then stopped, turned back, and looked at me. I was standing there, trying to calm myself. Not like it was going to solve anything.</p> <p>"You can stay. I think we can work something out," he said, and he turned away to answer the door.</p> <p>But I felt something inside, something like panic. I was suddenly afraid of what the bastard would think if he found out I had been talking to Kurt. If something went wrong, or if she was avoiding him for good, he'd figure it out, and we'd find something else to live with.</p> <p>But that fear was replaced with warmth that seemed to radiate through me. I stepped out into the foyer and took a deep breath. I walked across the foyer and into the living room where Kurt sat, reading a book. He looked up at me and smiled. He looked happy and content.</p> <p>"I've had some bad news," he said. "I heard you talk to Kurt some other time."</p> <p>"He told me it was a good idea to tell you," I said. "But now he's back in town. I mean, I really hope we'll be able to get married once Kurt and I get back. I don't want him to feel pressured when we do it; if he decides to have a child, the baby was probably not as big a deal!"</p> <p>"That's why you were so mad at him?"</p> <p>"Him?" I said. "If Kurt is going to have a kid, it's because there's a baby coming, after all. I can't wait for him to be over with and I can't let Kurt's baby be with someone else!" I looked at Kurt for a few moments, trying to process what I'd told him.</p> <p>"I'm not going to tell him anything about it, either, if you don't like. As much as I love you, Kurt and I love you more than anybody else in the world. It was just kind of an accident, I guess. You're my friend, your mom."</p> <p>"I love you, too."</p> <p>"But you should be happy that Kurt loves you this much. I wouldn't feel good about leaving you alone while he's gone." He took off his jacket, folded it and put it on the back of a chair. He stood and approached me. He was about five-feet, six inches tall, but not at all fat. His hair was straight and dark-brown and it fell over his dark brown eyes which were almost black.</p> <p>"Thanks for coming over," he said. "I know I'll always regret not telling you how much I love you."</p> <p>"My pleasure," I said. "Do you know the way back to my place? There's the stairs from the basement to the front door just in case."</p> <p>We walked along the first three steps, and he stopped and looked up at the large porch door. "Thank-you once again," he said, and we passed.</p> <p>When we got to the top of the steps, I turned and asked him "But I haven't really had any fun with Kurt and that he didn't really love you! What's his problem?"</p> <p>"He's no worse than his father. He's too shy. When I went to the office this morning to find out what happened, everyone in his office was laughing at me. I thought I was finally getting out of there! I was so embarrassed!" He laughed, but it was a quiet sound. A little harder than I'd intended, probably because the thought of him saying "Yes!" to his boss had made me feel more confident that I'd make it out on my own.</p> <p>I leaned over, reaching down and cupping his face in my hands and pulled him up to me. "Kurt loves you, too," I said. "I know I made him miserable for being able to have sex with your daughter so many years ago. And yes, I think he wants to continue to make out with me because of it. He doesn't really talk much about it, but we—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
