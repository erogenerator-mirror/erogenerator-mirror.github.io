He loved looking at this gorgeous blonde goddess; she reminded yet another of their previous encounter. She was also his mother, who had a pretty face, and long blonde hair, and seemed to look very much like his dad had.</p> <p>“Well, I did try to convince you to take the photos and maybe...” the man began, and she heard him draw in his breath. The next thing he knew, he was leaning over, lips brushing hers, and she felt him groan. Her mind drifted with his kiss. At first, he could not recall being kissed by anyone in the world, but as their lips parted, he felt a little guilt at being such a fool. Then something occurred to him that he could not explain. He could feel her tongue slipping past his lips, and he pulled her closer.</p> <p>Her body melted against him as they kissed, and their kiss was only the second time he had ever been with a woman. But that could be one of the reasons they seemed to be connected on such a level. It was the way they both looked at other people. It's what they thought about. He reached down under her skirt, and his cock throbbed as it rubbed against the silk of her panties. He felt his heart pounding in his chest, and his cock pulsed again as she ran her soft fingers along the ridge of his dick. He brought his hands up and cupped both of her breasts and felt her nipples start to stiffen for him again, as she reached up and pulled his face even closer to hers. He wanted to taste her mouth as he took her bra off.</p> <p>“I would say you got your bra to do this, but it’s not going to help much now, is it?” he asked, and she answered by reaching down and undoing the snap of his top. His shirt came off in the same fashion, and they were both bare under there. Her fingers found the knot at the waistband of his shorts and yanked it down slowly. She was not wearing any underwear or underwear tonight, as she had been saving the material away for later. She was a woman now, and she had taken care of him. They had just made love the first time, and he wanted her badly, and it felt so, so good. She kissed him again, and pulled her skirt down, but not all that far. He reached for her, and their kiss became a little more passionate as her hand went to him.</p> <p>She felt him, and moved her body against him so he felt every inch of her as she rubbed him. He felt her hand on him, and when she moved her head down and licked the tip of his cock she almost groaned. He had never felt anything like it, and he started to lose his self control.</p> <p>She knew she was making him crazy, as she pulled him up, and he felt her tongue licking his earlobe. He wanted to pull her over onto their bed, but thought it would be easier to just take her with his hand. He looked at her, and her face had lost that innocent look that he saw in their faces, and she looked sexy that way.</p> <p>“Don’t cum on your pants right now,” she said, and pulled his hands from him. She pulled him down on top of her, and he felt her tongue run along his lips. They both knew what was about to happen, but they also knew the risks. She was going to love him, and if they did wrong, they would end up in jail. But what if they liked it? Would she really like him, that much? He remembered how he had wondered about her, and what he was hoping that they would do would be as special to her as it was for him. He had never fantasized about seeing her with another woman, but he could still never live with her.</p> <p>He kissed her again, and when she broke the kiss she asked, “Have you had sex before?”</p> <p>He was still not sure if he wanted to tell her about his other feelings in the past like this, or just feel her pressing against her, but he told her it was a matter of time. They had not done anything.</p> <p>“I don’t think so,” she said, and pushed him out into the open. He watched her naked form from the balcony, and couldn’t resist taking her into his arms. They kissed, and she let him move his hands up along her back, and up to her breasts, where he cupped them in his hands. She put her head on his shoulder, and he cupped his hands under her bare breasts. As the two of them talked, the other—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
