"And we won't need a blanket. Maybe even get some new ones. And, of course, it will be our special night."</p> <p>"Are you sure you don't want to tell me how you have decided?"</p> <p>She looked over at Jason's face and saw that he had tears forming. "Jason, darling, I'm sure we're going to enjoy ourselves very much and do some wonderful things for each other," Amy said. "We can't wait to see how you do with your new friends."</p> <p>Amy had left it at that, but Jason knew that when he and Amanda had gotten home that her own son would be watching all the action of Amy and Jason going at it. And she could tell all that he wanted to do to her, all the time. Amanda looked on, smiling up at her and giving him a smile from ear to ear.</p> <p>"You know Jason," Amy began. "He will really love what is about to happen!"</p> <p>"Is he really going to fuck you, Amanda?"</p> <p>"Yes, honey. I know. That is why we all came tonight."</p> <p>"Well, Amanda, since Jason is going to give you a good fuck while I fuck him, and he really is good at it, he may even be the best lover and best fuck I ever had in my entire life!" Jason grinned. "The next time you are out with your friends, I want to be sure that Jason is a wonderful lover."</p> <p>"Jason, you really are very special, but remember what I said! I love every second of it!"</p> <p>"Amy will know. It's going to be a surprise for her."</p> <p>"I'm sure," Amy said.</p> <p>"Okay, I'll leave it at that," Jason said. "After I have some good sex with you in front of Amanda, I am not going to stop at just one." He was starting to get an idea of how he would go about giving Amanda his best fuck.</p> <p>"It feels so good to tell her that you are about to get a fucking from a man who is only too happy to make love to her all the time," Amanda said. "And I know, Jason, that you already have a lovely girlfriend who will go through the same ordeal.</p> <p>"And Jason?"</p> <p>"Yes?"</p> <p>"Would you fuck Amanda?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Good. Because all my pussy gets right now is Jason. Because I get what I came here to get!"</p> <p>"It's not just about his fucking."</p> <p>"Yes, it is, Jason, it is. I want to be sure that I won't be a problem. But after tonight I want to experience the pleasure I came and felt. And I want to do it to you tonight!"</p> <p>With that, she reached her hand down to Jason's dick and gently started rubbing and squeezing it ever so slowly. Jason was in heaven. "Oh, God, Amy, that feels so wonderful," he said. She was so good.</p> <p>Jason and Amanda started moving together slowly, slowly at first, but very quickly. They reached orgasm in a matter of minutes. Their voices were muffled by their kissing. They were getting closer to a common goal, and that was to go and have amazing sex at that end of the world. They started slowing down the action, but never stopped. As their orgasm subsided, they kissed over and over. And when they stopped kissing they began kissing in earnest. They went on for as long as possible, until they just couldn't hold it any longer and went all over the place.</p> <p>Finally, they got up, cleaned up in each other's arms, and went back to their bedroom to check out another movieâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
