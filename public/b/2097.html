The blade was glinting in the streetlight. Her eyes were drawn between a demon's face and the swordsman who was strangling her and his back.</p> <p>Her hand flew to her face, and it dropped an arm. She threw it away. Her eyes flicked between the sword and face again. This one was clearly a demon. He wore a wicked smile, but his hair was greasy and covered in grease. His skin was tinged with dust and blood. The blade had been drawn, and so he had used it for leverage. She pulled away from the fight and ran toward her companions.</p> <p>"This way," one of the men said in a hoarse voice.</p> <p>His voice was a mixture of pain and excitement. She looked at them both, one on both sides of her. She knew of her surroundings, but it was too dark to know for sure. There were too many questions.</p> <p>They led her down a wooden staircase that led to a large wooden hearth. It was small, but had a roof that was covered in green and yellow leaves. It was set back from a wall, but could be accessed by sliding dicks. There was a large, metal platform on which she could sit. She looked at the platform. It took care. It was small, but still very sturdy and sturdy.</p> <p>A few feet into the room was a large wooden table. The table was covered in green and yellow leaves. It had two huge metal rings in it, each about three feet off the ground.</p> <p>"Sit here," the man said. She hesitated.</p> <p>"Yes, sir, I will. Please, please, just let me go. Do you have a knife?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes, I have a knife. That is the only way you can kill those monsters without them killing you."</p> <p>He laughed. "But sir, that's not me. I was just going to tell you to get up and run. Don't you have a gun?"</p> <p>"No, I didn't have a gun," she said, shaking her head.</p> <p>"Then, I am not going to tell you to get up and run."</p> <p>She reached out her hands. There was something about his voice that sent shivers straight to her pussy. She felt excited and very scared. One of the other men stopped moving as the other man pulled back from her. She could see two sets of eyes at the sight of her. One pair seemed to be sizing up her body. And the demon was staring at her. She didn't know what to say. His eyes were wild. He could obviously watch her with his eyes. Then, he saw her face. She had a strange expression to her features. It was as if she was frightened or excited. And his erection was hard.</p> <p>"Take your top off, girl," the demon said again.</p> <p>She hesitated until the demon took her hands and led her over to the table. He reached up a hand and squeezed her breasts. She put her hands over her breasts and let him. Then, he reached down and began rubbing her pussy and rubbing her outer lips and clit.</p> <p>"Don't be scared," he said to the demon. "You won't be attacked here. And you can have a nice fuck, too."</p> <p>"Yes," the leader said. "I want to give a good service to you. Do you mind?"</p> <p>"No, not at all," the demon said. "You are free to go anywhere you want. You need not fear for the chance to live."</p> <p>With that, he turned and moved back toward his room. She continued to shake her head, and let it go. She couldn't move. She just wanted him to take her.</p> <p>She began to walk away from him. She walked up the staircase a few steps. After a couple of hundred steps, she stopped, still in her fear and fear of the demon. She turned and took a large step toward him. Then, she stopped again, still shaking from her fear and fear. She walked a few paces as her fear began to subside.</p> <p>When she reached the top of the stairs she stopped and turned away from the demon. Then, she walked down the stairs. There were no people in the street. She went to a small door at one end of the street. Inside, she pulled back the door key, swung her back door open, swung the back door around and closed it. Then, she turned away once again, and walked to the wall to climb out of the passage.</p> <p>Back up the stairs, she stopped once more. Her panic was rising again. She turned back around and walked toward the demon.
