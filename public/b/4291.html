His balls were small and tight in his tight pouch. He stroked his thick shaft with one hand as he stroked to feel the silky softness of the hair. He was breathing fast as he slid his fingers down over his sac and over his tight hole. All the time he kept looking into her beautiful eyes; she watched him intently. Her tongue ran along her upper lip as he moved just a millimeter lower. His tongue darted out as he licked up his pre-cum.</p> <p>She broke the kiss and licked her lips. She leaned back against the back of the sofa. Her body seemed to be glowing.</p> <p>She took his hand.</p> <p>“Come on, lover,” she said, “”Come to me.”</p> <p>Tom had been standing before her, naked except for his boxers. He wanted to get them off and make love. He had been nervous that she wouldn’t touch him just to be with her. He knew it would have embarrassed him but now it did. He’d made the decision. He wanted her. With him that much?</p> <p>In his hand, he held two long fingers as if he’d been holding a stick. He rubbed his middle finger as his other hand pressed firmly against his anus and slowly pushed into him, sliding deeper into his rectum. The tip of his finger made a popping sound as it slid out of his body. Her voice was soft and gentle in her words.</p> <p>“Tom,” she said, “let me get you in my mouth.” With that, she turned her body in the chair to face him. She leaned forward as they kissed. He kissed her. She pulled his shirt up and kissed his chest. She kissed him from his navel on his belly button, to his pubes. He felt the hairs of her hair tickle his skin as he kissed her and then he kissed and licked his way to her hot, wet flesh where she had started to lick her own juices as she sat there in front of him.</p> <p>He lay back on the sofa and waited with his head thrown back, his eyes closed in wanton bliss. She took his erect cock in her slender hands; he felt the smoothness. She stroked his cock for a moment, then looked intently at his glistening head. She opened her lips and gently took the tip inside. She took him completely inside, sucking on him in turn. His cock twitched as she did. Her tongue swirled around the sensitive glans. His legs spread wider and he started to move his hips against hers. She stopped her movements and kissed him again.</p> <p>Tom’s hand moved to her left breast. He squeezed it tenderly. Then he squeezed it a little harder. She had to hold his shaft with both hands. He felt that her nipple was swollen with a tightness and she liked that. His hand moved from her breast to her pussy. He rubbed her clit, pressing softly and feeling her pussy throbbing with her own desire. He slipped two fingers inside her. That she liked; she liked him inside her. He could feel the muscles tightening inside her. Just like with Sarah, she let him go. He moved his fingers around faster.</p> <p>She let his cock slide out. He knew he was in her. The sensation was intense but also thrilling at the same time. It was like he had entered an ocean. It was alive and floating in the air. He took his fingers free of her again and pushed in again, fucking his fingers with her. Then he pushed his fingers against her, inside her.</p> <p>“Come on, Tom,” she said. “Come fuck me.”</p> <p>Tom wanted to please her. He wanted that to be the part of their lovemaking they had both experienced.</p> <p>“I want you to fuck me.” She moaned as he started to move his fingers in and out.</p> <p>“Yes, Tom.”</p> <p>She lay back in the chair. He stood between her legs. He rubbed her thighs and hips as he watched her face. His cock was long, thick and hard. It was straining. She watched him as she took hold of his shaft with the hand supporting his shaft. She stroked his cock as he pushed his head into her. They both moaned together as he pushed inside her. She held his cock.</p> <p>She leaned forward to kiss him. He bent his knees to help her as he stood in the chair. His legs were around her shoulders; hers were around his waist. They moved together like the lovers they had been. He had his hand on her hip in the small of her back.
