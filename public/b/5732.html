"So you are going to fuck me so damn hard tonight?" She continued, "Then when I am done...you'll go to the bathroom and fuck me hard on the sink for all of eternity." She took her glass and stood up, "See, it is a little late to be saying 'fuck it', aren't we?"</p> <p>Kai's hands were working furiously between her legs, and she was making deep guttural noises that were the kind of sounds you make when you're having sex. She was so close...so very close! She was on the brink...she felt the beginnings of orgasm as her body started to quiver. Her hips began to rock...the muscles of her stomach began to ripple with its motion.</p> <p>She grabbed a handful of her beautiful hair and pulled her head back, the last of the breath left in her chest. She stared at her beautiful, sensual lover, her eyes misty as she looked into her eyes, "Fuck me," she moaned, as her tongue came out to trace her full lips from her brow and cheek to her collarbone and finally to her earlobe. She began to lick the tender skin around her ear and around her earlobe. The sounds of her mouth as it nibbled at her earlobe were driving her wild.</p> <p>Diana felt herself begin to explode. Her breathing came hard and faster and she felt her stomach quiver. She let out a long long moan as her climax was just beginning to overtake her. Her body went rigid as she let the waves start to subside. She was shaking almost uncontrollably.</p> <p>Kai knew that she had experienced something intense and she leaned in and kissed her lips. She tasted herself and felt very pleased that she could do that with such tenderness. She began to lick the inside of her legs and she began to caress the inside of her thighs with her hands.</p> <p>Diana leaned forward and grabbed hold of Kai's hips with both hands and slowly pulled herself towards her. She began to kiss and lick her way up her thigh. "Oh, Kai...what are you waiting for? Finish!" she smiled, "It's been such an exciting and long time, I want you inside me..."</p> <p>Kai didn't need to be told. She moved herself so that her face was just inches away from Kai's throbbing pussy and as quietly as she could, she began to dive her tongue within her.</p> <p>Diana began to tease her, running the tip of her tongue over the folds of skin on the outer folds, and then up again to the sensitive point at the top. She heard Kai's breathing get quicker, "Aaah...Kai...if you don't stop, I'm afraid...I'm losing it..." she cooed as she dove deeper, her tongue working frantically on her pussy as she felt waves of sensation washing over her.</p> <p>Diana's orgasm was so powerful that it seemed that she would never stop. She felt like she was going to explode and it seemed that it wouldn't happen this time. She kept herself there as long as she could.</p> <p>Kai let out a small cry and her back arched. She couldn't believe how wonderful this felt. She was lost...her body shuddered as an orgasm crashed over her. She pulled herself up to kiss her once again, "Oh, Kai...I never knew it...that..." She bit her lip, trying to control herself, "...this is amazing...keep doing that..."</p> <p>Diana knew she was doing more than just being able to orgasm; she was actively trying to prolong this.</p> <p>She heard Kai's breath deepen as she felt herself begin to lose her hold on her emotions again. She looked into her eyes. They seemed to glaze over as she smiled as the feeling of her climax slowly ebbed. "Don't you worry, Kai...I'll never let you go." She whispered to herself.</p> <p>Diana broke herself from their embrace and stood, looking down into Kai's eyes as she pulled her up so that she was face to face. Her eyes burned with passion. "I just feel so good right now; I want more than anything to make love with you..." she said with a grin.</p> <p>Kai looked at Diana, whose pussy was still soaking wet between her legs. It was obvious she had enjoyed herself as much as she had enjoyed Diana's. "A little later. I have to go to the bathroom to clean up." she whispered, "And while you're gone, could you maybe put in my top drawer and use the vibrator I took you through in there? Or can I get the vibrator out of it, just to see what it is made of?"</p> <p>Diana stood there thinking and pondering for a second.
