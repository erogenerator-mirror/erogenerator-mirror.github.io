The next few days followed as he had no need to dress up for the job. He felt totally uninhibited but was glad to work with an open mind. In the office he was totally different. On Monday Steve left the store with the following items on his mind. Firstly he was wearing a pair of white shorts and a plain white shirt that buttoned down the front. The other items that he wore on this trip were in the top drawer of his desk. When Steve returned to his office a few hours later he noticed that the material of the shirt was a more translucent color and seemed to cling. The shirt itself was the colour of silk and had an outline of the muscles beneath the material. When Steve had opened the front of the shop the shirt was slightly damp and he could feel his penis start to harden and move against his trousers. He had felt excited as he approached Steve's office after the incident with Steve earlier that day.</p> <p>Steve had spent as much time as he could with his secretary as a lunch break was about to begin. There was a knock at the door. The door was unlocked. When the manager opened the door he found Steve sitting at his office desk, reading the newspaper. Steve was wearing a blue shirt, shorts and a blue tie. He looked good. It was only a business-like lunch break after all and Steve expected to be busy for the rest of his time.</p> <p>The door opened and an attractive young woman stood outside. He smiled but said nothing. As the door opened the young woman said something and Steve opened his mouth to say something but nothing came out. The girl closed the door and Steve did the same. They continued to talk for a minute so that the woman wouldn't be disturbed. Finally Steve spoke.</p> <p>"Hi, I'm Steve. I'm here for you today." Steve opened his mouth to say something more but couldn't find any words. He spoke out, "Yes, I'm an English teacher in a small private school in the town of Luton." He stood up and walked backwards towards a desk. It was a desk with the words 'English education' stenciled in big red letters.</p> <p>"What do you want?"</p> <p>"Oh, what are you doing here?" He asked rather than spoke.</p> <p>"I wanted to show you the facilities, Mr. Green. I've a history class this afternoon." She smiled.</p> <p>Steve couldn't believe how he felt at that moment. He was completely under his teacher's powerful spell. They had met a few weeks earlier, she had told him that, if he needed a little assistance with it, she would be happy to help. Even if she didn't see it as a personal interest, it would pass.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm Steve."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm Lucy. I've got a lot to tell you about, er, school." (He was quite sure that that she was still referring to Lucy)</p> <p>Steve looked around the room at all the student papers he must have missed a lot. There were so many papers in front of him that he doubted the quality of the papers. There were so many words that he wouldn't have recognised. The language lesson and the first words to enter it weren't bad. The school had a very large English department and Steve was aware that the school used language in their curriculum. However, the teacher hadn't brought out a great amount of words. Lucy had told him that she had never been teachers before. Steve thought that his teacher was a very wise woman.</p> <p>Lucy said, "Your English literature is very good, you really do have a good grasp of how it is made, Mr. Green. It's all very simple but, to show it."</p> <p>Lucy put some papers in front of Steve's desk and sat in it. She had a very good position and it left Steve looking at her for longer periods. He could feel himself get stiff and turned on. Lucy noticed him looking at her and smiled in his direction. Lucy walked to Steve and sat down on his lap.</p> <p>"Yes. That would be very nice. I've always loved teaching English Literature." Lucy told him.</p> <p>Steve reached up and found the hem of Lucy's dress. He slowly pulled it up and over her head. Now Steve could see the top of Lucy's breasts. Lucy had very soft boobs. They were slightly larger than the average American A cup and her body wasn't very skinny. Their weight was probably not enough for most of the teachers in Britain.</p> <p>"I'm Lucy." Lucy said.</p> <p>She quickly sat up and took his hand.</p> <p>"Would you like to have lunch with me today?" Lucy asked.
