"So, would you like to fuck me or not?"</p> <p>I smiled at him. "Well, actually, I've wanted to fuck you ever since the first night of our wedding."</p> <p>"I'm glad that you enjoyed it," he grinned, "And, well, I'm not sure, but I did think that you weren't ready for that yet."</p> <p>"Mmm, well, you were right," I purred, "This is great, but I just don't think that I'm ready for this."</p> <p>"I know, I know," he said as his fingers tickled my nipples. "Well, you are," he added, "But, I think we can still make the most of that, so let me help you move your head over. Can you use your hand to rub some lubrication on my dick before you put it in you?"</p> <p>I did as he asked, moving my head to take his dick into my mouth, moving it in and out of my moist lips in an out-of-my-life motion. While not a very good use of mouth, not that it mattered in the slightest. I loved my dick doing what I was doing to it. A man like Tony didn't know that I was a man. Tony may have been a real-world stranger, but I was a man.</p> <p>With his shaft sliding into my mouth, I felt his head hit the back of my throat. I liked the way that he felt, like it was pushing on my throat, as he kept rubbing my nipples, while I continued sucking on his dick. After a few minutes of this, he raised my head back up, pulled my hair aside and asked me to take his dick out of my mouth.</p> <p>"I like that," I purred, "I like it when you keep me wanting to suck your cock, or, to fuck me."</p> <p>"Of course we can start out slow, sweetheart," he answered as he began stroking into my mouth. "I do this because it's the right time and place." He used slow movements in and out of my mouth, while his hand moved up and down my shaft. He used slow, firm strokes. "The feel of my dick in your mouth is so sensual, baby," he purred as his cock swelled in my mouth. "It's like this... I just know I can make you feel good... like this... but I don't feel anything. Don't feel anything." Tony added with a note of concern. "This feels good."</p> <p>"I like that," I purred as I cupped his balls in one hand.</p> <p>"I... like... that... too," he finished as he continued to pump his dick in and out of my mouth. A moment later, he removed his hand and I took his cock back in my head to stroke him as I began working to get his dick back to full erection. A minute later, he stopped me for a moment. "I need to see if it's working, sweetheart," he added. I looked again at his dick. It felt rock-hard as it stuck straight up in the air in front of my face. Tony reached down and pulled my chin up towards his hard dick. He pressed my face against his stiff dick, where it's head was rubbing my lips and chin. All of a sudden, he stopped.</p> <p>He stepped back, "If you want more, just ask. I won't hold back."</p> <p>"I want more, Tony."</p> <p>"I'll give you all that you want," he said, as he stepped back and released his dick from my lips. I felt his fingers pull my arms out towards the ceiling, to tie my hands behind my back. He wrapped my nipples tightly and pulled the ends of the rope off, making my breasts move back and forth. "Take off the rest of your blindfold."</p> <p>The man behind me had me turn around and was tying my hands to my sides, while he had me bend over against the bed, with my ass in his hands. I could feel his breath on my pussy as he teased my ass with his tongue and his fingers. A couple minutes passed with my nipples brushing against his face. Again, he stopped, but this time, I felt him push the head of his dick against my wet lips. As he pushed past them, I felt his dick pushing at my mouth again.</p> <p>"That's right," I heard in his voice. "That's what I want." His lips brushed mine just as his dick, now wet from my wet hole, parted and slid inside me. Once the head was inside me, I felt him press the rest of his way inside me. I could feel his shaft slide around my clit, which was swollen and throbbing from his excitement. He slid in and out, slowly, almost teasingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
