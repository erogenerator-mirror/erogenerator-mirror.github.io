"Please," she said again in my ear. "Come on, stud," she said to me. She got out of the car and came around to me and put one arm around my shoulders and the other one wrapped around me. We walked hand in hand away from the highway and she bent my ear to my mouth, "I want to put a blind fold on you, baby." She got in the driver's seat and I looked at the frontview mirror and the car was in front of her house. She got in in the passenger seat with her arms around my neck and pulled me close with her hands on my ass cheeks. The smell in her mouth was intoxicating, her tongue was licking all up my neck and into my earlobe and the smell was driving me crazy.</p> <p>She was starting to kiss my earlobe and then started to nibble it. "Mmmmm," she said. "Do you like this?" she asked. This time I nodded and mumbled a yes. Then she went back to kissing my earlobe and licking it. "Mmmmm," she said. "Mmmmm." She pushed her mouth back and said again. "Take me to your bedroom. I want you to take me to your bedroom and fuck me."</p> <p>And she did, taking charge immediately and without hesitation. She let go of me and I pulled my clothes off, then took the blindfold off and slid the cuffs off my wrists and ankles. I was in the car now on my side of the car. Not far from the highway or at least two feet behind a semi, so there wasn't much of a view except my backside in the passenger's seat. Not much of my body on the road either. The blindfold was a blind fold. I felt so helpless and so helpless I could be in any way a person would be.</p> <p>She took me off the highway down the highway and stopped for a second. Then, without looking at me, she blindfolded me and drove us in the opposite direction in to my condo building. The blindfold was not tight, and it didn't seem uncomfortable at all.</p> <p>She had told me how we got into our condo. She had said it was her old place, that she had it built to be near the beach. She said we lived down stairs because she didn't want to drive to her office just yet. She pointed up there, pointed to that beautiful condo that seemed to me so familiar. There was no other car around, just a big driveway, a house that she knew was in a nice part of town. She had told me we were there with a blindfold in hand if I liked. I wanted to see her apartment and the way she lived. I wanted to feel her inside of me.</p> <p>And she wanted to feel me. She pulled my head towards her and I could feel her lips on mine, her tongue in my own mouth, her hand on mine. Her hands started to caress me. Her tongue was at work on mine now, and that sensation drove me crazy. I was a cock craving woman, not just a pussy. In my mind I could feel that and knew she could.</p> <p>In a heartbeat I kissed her and she kissed me back and let go and we were kissing. I could taste my own come on her lips and I could feel her tongue as she licked my mouth and her fingers on my nipples. We kissed like lovers, each one becoming aroused just talking, each one getting more than their own parts. I kissed around her neck and she licked and sucked on my earlobe and worked the muscles in my neck like it was her mouth. I was enjoying it very much.</p> <p>She stopped kissing me just long enough to roll me on my side and pull the blindfold on the side away from my eyes. She had told me that there could be a lot of things in this room that weren't completely open or open to me, but there could be a lot more in this room, too. It was a very neat layout, just right. I could open my eyes and she was standing at one end of the dark room with a large mirror at one end. She was watching a TV screen right in front of me, and she was still wearing the blindfold, still wearing her high heels. I wondered if she was still fully clothed.</p> <p>She held out the blindfold and I felt it slowly slipping out of my vision. It was soft like a blindfold and she turned my head to see what it looked like. I opened my eyes. I looked very self-conscious at what my eyes were seeing in front of me, in the mirror. She had the light at an angle that seemed too low to see anything, but my eyes were focused on how the blindfold did not stretch or adjust at all, so they would not be seen by anyone else.
