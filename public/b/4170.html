The bitch had just been flirting with me and I knew my anger was going away. We had a long drive back home and the girls were just hanging out by the pool. It was getting to be quite late, and we had a really good time. I'm pretty sure I saw a little girl in her bikini come in to the house, but that is no big deal. The last I heard, I had a long, passionate, sweaty, and very wet kiss. She came to my place, but when she saw me walking toward us, she smiled and hugged me. This wasn't how I had expected it to go, but I liked it.</p> <p>As we broke off the kiss, we exchanged some small talk, just as if we were back on the job at the office.</p> <p>"So you're just coming back out to your family?" I asked. It was a stupid question, because we already knew it from the little girl in her bikini.</p> <p>"No sweetie. In fact, we're coming home and have a great time," she said. She didn't sound very happy, but I couldn't tell if she was mad at me for not taking her up on her offer to come out on the patio.</p> <p>"I'm glad you decided to come out to the patio," I said. She looked at me with a strange look on her face. "I wasn't looking to see if you were coming out to the patio," I said.</p> <p>She started to laugh. I was about to leave, but then I could see out of the corner of my eye that a woman had come out to the patio where we were standing. She was maybe five feet or so, short blonde hair, but very pretty. She had bright blue eyes that were as big as her head, and perky little B cup breasts. They were probably a C cup. Her skin was light. They were perky and tan but without any obvious sag. Her legs were long, and she was toned. Her butt was really nice.</p> <p>I could see that she had a big smile on her face, so I let go of her hand, reached down, and slid my hand from her waist up the inside of her left thigh to her sweet, smooth vagina. Her hips moved up a little, and I could feel the soft skin of her outer labia moving against my finger. I slipped my finger down, and slipped it between her outer lips. She was wet. She was so wet. I could feel it, and it tasted like she has a lot of juice. She gasped as I slipped my finger up inside her. She was so tight I could feel all the veins of her vagina as I fingered them. I could feel up the side of her neck, and across her cheek, where it brushed her earlobes. She didn't move as I rubbed her clit, and I could feel that it was like it got bigger each time. My fingertip slid in and out a couple of times, then up over her clit, pressing it lightly.</p> <p>She just stared back at me, mouth open, staring down at me, smiling a little. "Hi, lover," she said.</p> <p>I took her hand and pulled it back to the other side of my face. She hesitated a second.</p> <p>"Not yet," I said to her, "I can't believe I finally decided to come out here."</p> <p>In an instant, it clicked in my mind that it was a really sexy moment. I could see the surprise in her face, the surprise at seeing me come out here with her, and the lust in her eyes. She took my hand with both hands and brought it to her mouth, opening her lips in a sexy kiss. I felt a tingle in my body, I'm sure from the alcohol. It got even better looking when she parted her lips, letting out a sigh and a moan.</p> <p>Once again, I took her hand and led her to the patio, then lay her down on the lounger, then climbed on top of her, and slid my cock up and into her sopping wet pussy. She let out a moan as I started to fuck her. I had just gotten my first real look at her as a woman, and was very happy. She had a face made of porcelain, and I couldn't see how any other shape, shape, or texture could make her look. Her breasts were small, and so sexy to be seen. She had small nipples, and I took them between my thumb and forefinger. I pinched them lightly, feeling how nice they felt. I felt her hips going up into me, then felt the muscles along the length of my cock moving up and down. I moved my thumb around to rub my clit, feeling that the pressure was building deep within. I could imagine running my fingerâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
