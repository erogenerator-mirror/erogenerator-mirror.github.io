He then leaned over, placing his feet flat on the floor and moved his hand towards my mouth.</p> <p>My mouth watered as he reached up to place his hand in mine, my tongue already lapping his fingers. I looked up at him with lust in my eyes, my head falling back onto the bed. "Get on your knees, kitten." I felt him shift as the tip of his cock pressed against my pussy lips. I spread my legs a little, giving him an opening. He lowered his body. Taking his throbbing cock into my hand, I slowly guided him to the entrance of my pussy. I felt him slide himself into me. It hurt at first, but as he filled me, I closed my eyes and relaxed into him. I felt his hands on my hips as he drove himself into me. He paused, just as we finished, before pulling out and pressing back into me with an urgency I was soon meeting. We repeated this until both our pussies were aching with need and need to orgasm. He slowly pulled out and then slammed himself back into me, filling me as much as his cock was going in.</p> <p>"Come for me, lil' Kitty. Come for me with your hot little pussy." His voice carried through my senses with him. Just as I heard his voice, his fingers pulled my clit out of hiding. I moaned and came hard, a deep rumble vibrating through my body and down through my toes. Each orgasm pulsed through me and was met by his pounding in me. Every motion of his body brought his cock, balls and thighs into my pussy and held his cum deep within me. I heard him grunt and groan with every release. I felt a wave of euphoria and lust course through me and flow back into my body.</p> <p>After another minute, his cock pulled out of me and dropped off my body, his cum dripping out of me onto the sheets. I was still naked except for the white lace bra that I wore, my black heels still on the floor, and the black lace panties that I'd put on before falling to the ground. My legs were still spread as I lay on my stomach. He stood at the end of the bed, his cock still rock hard and ready to go. He crawled up the bed and lay down next me. His hands went to my thighs and he spread them apart. I laid my head on his chest, my fingers running through his chest hair. He shifted his hips and the tip of his cock pressed against my bare pussy lips. He pushed himself inside me. I could feel the weight of his body settle on top of me. "You are so beautiful, Kitty," he whispered. His mouth came to mine, kissing me tenderly. I could taste some of the remnants of our previous activities on his tongue as it left a trail of my own on his lips. Kissing was always nice, even after a long day of working as a waitress. "Do you trust me, little Kitty?" He whispered to me. The only reply, which I couldn't think of.</p> <p>He pulled himself out and then thrust into me again. I wrapped my legs about his waist as he thrust into me, his hands coming up from the side to cup my ass through the sheer mesh of the bra. Our bodies were locked together as he held himself deep within me, our tongues fighting in our mouths. I could feel the heat of his seed as it shot into my body. "God that felt good, sweetheart. I love you so much." I murmured to him, as we kissed. He wrapped his arms around me, holding me tight as he continued to gently thrust into me. Eventually, as we felt the need come back, our bodies slowed and then stopped. He lay there on top of me, his penis still inside me, resting. We just lay there, kissing, talking, whispering things that we couldn't say.</p> <p>When I had regained my breath and was still breathing, he kissed me on the lips in the middle. We stayed for a few minutes and then, before I could speak, he moved himself from me, his lips finding mine once again. He kissed me gently, but deeply, the feel of his body next to mine, his kisses, even my breath, all bringing to me that desire. He broke the embrace and laid beside me. I turned and nestled my head on his shoulder as I watched him. "You know what happens when I go the wrong way?" I asked, leaning onto my elbow, staring at the ceiling.</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"You're gonna get upset if you keep on getting upset when you're not used to being so good at what you do." I could see he was in a turmoil. He looked so much like his father.
