I'm old enough to go around being a kid."</p> <p>"Aww, you're such a little slut, but maybe when I get a little older you'll be more mature."</p> <p>I was shocked when he pulled me off the bed and pulled me up, dragging me with him after him. "Bitch," I said when he pushed me back into the bed. He kissed me again, a little more passionately than before and I moaned into his mouth.</p> <p>His hands gripped my ass, pulling me up so I was straddling his lap. His hands were all over me, stroking and caressing every inch of my skin. I was so turned on, I wanted him inside me. I pushed my chest into his and moaned again.</p> <p>I felt like a naughty animal, I was about to explode but he stopped me and lifted me off him. I thought his hand was going for my pussy but when a moment later he wrapped his hands around my hips and pulled me back onto his cock. I screamed as he sank inside. I was so turned on I didn't know what to do. I felt so full, so stretched, then I felt him reach the hilt. I didn't think he could slide it in that far but I took over. A deep moan came from my lips as I sat impaled on his cock.</p> <p>He started pounding my pussy. His hands pulled my thighs back toward my chest as he thrust himself in and out, almost back and forth. The thrusts hurt a little but the pain only added to the pleasure. He slowed down, letting me control the pace.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah," I said. He started pulling me further up and back down his pole in a circular motion. I could barely hold myself up now, my nipples and clit were on fire and I was on fire.</p> <p>"Fuck, babe." He moaned as he thrust down again. He was moving faster now.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah. You like how I feel, don't you?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes." His hands gripped my ass cheeks, pulling me down into him over and over again. My clit was throbbing, even through his cock.</p> <p>"Oh god, yes, yes." I said, lost in the feeling. I could feel myself tightening on his thrusting cock each time he buried himself completely in me.</p> <p>"How does that feel, baby?" he asked in a deep baritone.</p> <p>"Ah, so good," I moaned as I got closer to finishing. It felt like a wild orgasm building inside of me. I felt like I was going to explode.</p> <p>"Yes, fuck!" he said, grabbing my breasts and squeezing them, pulling my nipples until they ached. "Come for me," he said as he started thrusting faster, almost lifting me up.</p> <p>"I'm gonna," I said suddenly as my body tensed and started to quake. His thrusts kept pounding into me. Waves of pure pleasure were building. I leaned forward and put my body in a half crouch on the bed, lifting my pussy higher as he kept thrusting into me, taking more and more of his cock deeper inside me each time. My hips bounced and thrashed and squirmed and my head was shaking, moaning, and begging, all for him. I wanted to say anything to let him keep going like this but the words just flowed out.</p> <p>"Ah, fuck! Yes, fuck!" I let go. "I'm cumming, lover!" My body started to quiver. My lips were parted and I groaned as my body exploded around him. He kept thrusting into me, not stopping until I collapsed on the bed, on his lap, my body feeling so drained. He pulled out of my pussy, a wet smear on his pole.</p> <p>"You're too much, babe," I said as he helped me off of his lap. "Let me up."</p> <p>"You don't have to. I'm getting up from the bed, I left you this dress and that was so sexy," he said. He pulled me up into his arms and kissed me. "I guess you're ready to be more comfortable." I said as I got off the bed, put my dress and shoes back, brushed my hair, straightened myself, and stepped away, naked except for the heels.</p> <p>"You have a lot of good qualities," he said as he turned me around, lifted me into his arms and carried me into his bedroom.</p> <p>"I didn't think I needed any of that," I said as he laid me down on the bed, taking me the entire way down.
