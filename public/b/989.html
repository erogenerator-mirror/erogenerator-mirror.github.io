He put on his clothes, went to the kitchen and made for breakfast, his face on fire. "My god, you look like some of the most beautiful people in the world!" He took the bacon and eggs out of the fridge and set them in front of her and walked down the stairs at that point and started walking to the living room.</p> <p>"Wait, wait, that wasn't right." Rachel was still looking at him with pleading eyes.</p> <p>"We haven't even started. You are so pretty, you know, I just like the way your hair looks when you are angry."</p> <p>"Why don't you go and sit down?"</p> <p>So as far as he was concerned, she'd say "No." She was definitely looking forward to doing so now. "Don't I always?"</p> <p>"No, I mean come sit down." He sat down facing her and put an arm around her shoulders at that point. "I thought you wanted to talk about a couple of things." His hand dropped to his side and she quickly crossed her legs.</p> <p>"Oh... I'm pretty sure I do." Rachel had already put her drink down and was now taking a sip from the glass beside him.</p> <p>"Good, that's what I've started. I was going to talk about a couple of things first." He placed his hand on her knee and she moved closer to him at that point. "You've been acting strange lately, so I think now is the time to ask your opinion." He sat staring into her eyes a little more. "I know you've been upset about your divorce from Tony."</p> <p>She blushed a little and then looked away.</p> <p>"I am, but..." He pulled her closer to him and she sat with him leaning against him. He was looking at her almost like he thought she was trying to talk him into leaving again, but he didn't want to be rude, so he just took a breath and continued. "I was feeling a little guilty about you and I realized that we need to talk about how you feel about Tony a lot for a reason. I wanted to go over a few things with you and you seem to get a little uncomfortable at this end of everything."</p> <p>"Why on earth would I be uncomfortable around you?"</p> <p>"Well... I wanted to help you figure out what you were thinking and if that's what it takes to make you love him."</p> <p>"How is that supposed to make me love you?" She couldn't help but look at him again and she didn't move away anymore. "I don't get it! We can't just be friends! I mean I was hoping you and Tony could be a lot more... intimate than that, but I can't let that happen."</p> <p>"What can I say? It was my own feelings about the situation I found out about a long time ago. I felt so bad about you at the time because I would have been happy to have been able to help you."</p> <p>Rachel looked at him in shock and almost smiled. Her eyes were bright red and she could feel herself getting excited. Then she looked away again."Now, where were we? Oh, okay." She wasn't really looking away anymore. Her eye contact with him was still rather uncomfortable so she leaned back in his arms and put her hand on her own breast and gently stroked it through her top.</p> <p>"So... it's okay to love a nice guy."</p> <p>Rachel just smiled and looked at him a little bit closer. "I just thought if you were feeling guilty about all of this, that perhaps you would want to be with me."</p> <p>"Of course I do, I love you with all of my heart!" He pulled her closer to him and put his hand on her shoulder and slid it down. He put it on top of her skirt and she let out a very soft sigh at the touch of his hand.</p> <p>"I think this makes it less of a lot of pressure to have sex with Tony though, that it's not like anything is to be done in our relationship." He slid his hand from her shoulder down her arm and gently put it on the side of her breast while still sitting facing her. "It's just a matter of figuring out if we should go through with it or not."</p> <p>Rachel didn't need a second thought. She was going to be in control and he could just do as he liked with the rest of the night. It wasn't that she had any intention of having sex with him. No, it just had to be, if and just if he wanted to do anything about it. "Okay." She took another sip of her drink and put her hand on top of his and put an arm around it as they were sittingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
