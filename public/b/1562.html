"If you think you're going to keep your promise, just keep doing it."</p> <p>He nodded and ran a finger along my cheek and my jaw. I felt his hardness, pressing against me as he knelt right beside me. He rubbed the head of his cock against me as I pushed back to take him into my mouth. He groaned as I sucked him. I looked into his eyes and saw the love I must have for him.</p> <p>"We'll have plenty of time to do that in the morning" he smiled.</p> <p>He started moving in and out of my mouth, his fingers sliding through my hair. "I just want you to be with me more often, baby. I promise."</p> <p>I moved my hands to his hips to hold him close as he thrust in and out of my mouth. I wanted to feel him again.</p> <p>He groaned out "Oh god, please suck this cock, baby. It makes me so hard," then he pulled out of my mouth and turned me around, facing away from him. He wrapped his hand around the shaft, rubbing the head around my soaking pussy, the tip coming to rest against my ass hole.</p> <p>"You do know what the fuck is right and proper to suck a cock, don't you?" he demanded.</p> <p>"Do you want to fuck me in my ass?" I teased back, my hands running up and down his muscled thigh.</p> <p>"Oh god yes," he groaned as he pushed more into my ass. "I want you ass stretched around my cock, baby."</p> <p>"I want it all, as much as you want it."</p> <p>He pulled all but the head out, still smiling as he slowly pushed all the way back in. He took his hand off my ass and held his cock, rubbing the head up and down between my lips. I opened my legs more as he entered my soaked pussy.</p> <p>"Oh god, I love this, you're so wet..." he moaned.</p> <p>He started moving back and forth slowly in my ass, his eyes focused intently on me. I kept looking back as he kept thrusting into me, smiling at me, a look of pure lust on my face. It excited me to know that I wanted to be used.</p> <p>As my head banged against the wooden backboard as he pounded me, his cock grew harder and faster. I was getting close and I was sure it would not be long before I felt him release in my ass.</p> <p>"God, baby...so good," he moaned, continuing to fuck me in the ass for half an hour or so.</p> <p>We were both breathing hard as the tension left our bodies. He looked into my eyes when he finished. "Thank you....," he began.</p> <p>"I'm glad you enjoyed this, baby. I know this day could really get better!" I giggled, feeling the tingles between my legs.</p> <p>He stepped away from me, leaning against the headboard. He rubbed his cock against his stomach and balls, smearing more precum all over himself. I ran a soft finger along my lips as if I was tasting some kind of fruit, licking and savoring the flavor. "You do seem to really like my cum, it's actually really naughty tasting it. I don't know....," he said, looking down at our bodies, "I'm really hard to control now."</p> <p>"You're really hard for me, baby."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm really horny for your cock!" he told me. "I can't resist you!," he said, and he started to move against me again.</p> <p>"Do you want me to try it??" I asked.</p> <p>He shook his head. "You're in love with me now."</p> <p>"I want you in my ass, honey. I'm really into having you here," I told him.</p> <p>"I like that. Please, baby, I'll do anything," he said, trying to sound eager, but failing miserably.</p> <p>I moved into him, grinding my body against his as he put his hands on my hips. I could feel his cock hard against me and I pushed back against him.</p> <p>"Okay, I need you again. Can you get in me from behind?"</p> <p>I got off the bed, pulling all of my clothing off as he knelt before me. He turned me around and sat me down on the edge of the bed, lying on his back. He kissed me deeply.</p> <p>"I really enjoy being in that position. Your legs can stretch out, and your pussy can slide back and forth across my mouth without being in control?," heâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
