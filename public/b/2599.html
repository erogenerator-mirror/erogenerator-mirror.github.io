That will give you plenty of time to sort out your new life!"</p> <p>"I don't really have to do anything," she said sadly. "I guess I just wanted to get out of the house as soon as possible. I was scared that Mum would get upset and demand another trip; this whole thing isn't mine.</p> <p>When I got home that night I couldn't get around what had been going between Mum and I that night; I knew we were going to get along as if we hadn't been apart for years. It was the beginning of something that we never would have been able to have again and even though I had hoped that maybe we could have remained together afterwards I felt that our love wouldn't be enough to make up for the hurt we'd been through.</p> <p>I think it was because she was still a virgin and I had been planning to marry her for a long time; she'd always been a bit timid and reserved around me. It might be that she was a bit fearful about me being a cuckold but that would make the whole thing a bit easier if she were to believe that I wasn't the cuckold!"</p> <p>I felt that I'd made a big mistake but wasn't sure how much time had passed since she had said that; I just guessed that it was after a few days when she had taken up the idea of having our first sexual relationship without my permission. There was a lot of that coming to the end.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>When I met Emma at a supermarket one day she and I hadn't gone near each other in years. I have to admit that I like her but I also like the freedom that she has and the freedom to be a woman. It gives me the freedom to be a woman and I never get tired of being happy from being one.</p> <p>Our parents had told us that there would be no formalities about marriage between us so we were going to have to marry. There had been a lot of arguing, I had told my parents that mum wasn't going and would be leaving me and I'd also been told to take no notice of the 'married woman' at home. Well, that had ended shortly before mum had given my dad the news about her leaving. If I can live with what that had been I'll be fine with that mum, I thought.</p> <p>Mum had been married twice before Mum got caught in the wrong house so she and dad had got her to stay at mine. She had been the one to tell me that he was going to take a lover, a girl called Kate - it was the last time that she even mentioned it. To make matters worse they had been living in a bedroom while she and I were living together. The reason for that didn't really surprise me and she had tried to be nice and make him feel better, but that was mainly due to Mum's constant attempts to make the situation look like it was going smoothly between them.</p> <p>It was a nice couple of weeks before I was in love with a woman who was pregnant and Mum had told me all that it would take when it was all over and I was getting to be an old cuckold and getting a girlfriend.</p> <p>I guess that was part of what I wanted to do, to get it out of my system before things got out of hand. Anyway, I had been doing a lot of thinking about it and came to the conclusion that there was little in it for me to gain with the divorce, and that I'd probably be a cuckold forever. I just had to admit that I was still a real, healthy, and very happy being a female; I was not going to make it back out that way.</p> <p>My parents were also going to be in a celebratory celebration but I hadn't told them about that last time and I told them the time before that.</p> <p>I had a lot of work to do on the new house but also needed some good looking girls that might suit me. I was also getting serious about adding a new wardrobe so I was hoping that Mum's wardrobe and Mum's wardrobe would have been the same.</p> <p>If there were at least a couple of things that I wanted as a woman I was sure that Mum would agreeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
