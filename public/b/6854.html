Then when he was out the door, I headed for the door. He waited for my entrance. I was going to go and change, but he was just gone. He'd left for the airport. I went outside, got into my car and drove away, taking my time, not caring if someone had seen me there. I didn't want to get in any trouble.</p> <p>My car was out of commission until I was done. I didn't know where to go. There weren't any restaurants to be seen, so I got a cab downtown to get to the restaurant. There was no other traffic on there. Just as I was about to turn the corner, I had a surprise coming my way. I was looking into the mirror, and in my hands was two beautiful, long, dark nipples. It was so dark that one would have thought someone else was staring. I couldn't help myself, I wanted them to feel that way.</p> <p>"Well, I don't know. What is it? Are you a lesbian, maybe even bi-sexual?" I turned around to go, and I saw a guy that I had never seen before. "Excuse me, I think there's a mistake here." There was some confusion on his face, and I just looked at him as he looked at me. I really wanted to say something, but I didn't want him to think I was some kind of slut, and make me tell him about myself. He leaned towards me and kissed me tenderly. "I guess it's the first time we've had an experience like this. It is nice to have someone else in the room with us." He whispered in my ear. The idea of having someone else in the room with me, was pretty hot!</p> <p>Suddenly the cab door opened and a middle aged man entered and came to a stop beside me. He was a middle age man. A tall, pretty redhead, probably between 50 and 55. His hair came down almost to his waist and he had great hands. He just stood there, looking at me. For some reason, it didn't quite look right. I just looked at him without saying anything. That's when the real trouble started.</p> <p>"I see you haven't moved yet. It must be really hard for you, not to move." The redhead said. He turned to walk away but stopped and looked at me. "Look, this has nothing to do with you, I mean, I just didn't expect you to take some guy's place here and just... it makes me hot, you wouldn't believe how much I like you."</p> <p>He stepped forward, his eyes scanning me, not me. He got to his knees, right in front of my face. I started to say something, but I just stopped cold.</p> <p>"This guy is different. He doesn't look like you. If it doesn't make him look good, it's ok." He said. I was really starting to regret saying that, I had to be so honest with myself. "Go ahead, sit that little ass down and let's take turns being the one to get a cock shoved right up there. I'm pretty sure there's nothing that will fit here." I was so upset, I thought I was about to faint.</p> <p>He looked back and forth from me to the cab, then back again. "Would you get that seat up? I have to get up from sitting down, but the view from here is nice as this." He said motioning to his crotch.</p> <p>I couldn't believe what he had just said. I had to look away from the car and back at him. What had I gotten myself into? How could he make me want it? Why was I being such a bitch, for the last 3 months? I couldn't be sure I was feeling in the best frame of mind to even go out for lunch with him. He pulled off the line and I went back into the cab as quickly as I could. I knew I shouldn't be letting this man see me like this, but I just couldn't. I looked at him with tears in my eyes. He got back into his seat and looked at me the way a man's looks at a lady.</p> <p>I turned off of the driveway and walked out of there. "Well, I guess I had better stay right there, huh?" I said. I'm sure he just chuckled at my statement, and he leaned over and kissed me. "Don't be long." He said. I just nodded and ran back through the house into the guestroom. I went out into the hall and into my room. It was dark and I didn't know if he came out to see me. I could barely make out the darkness of my room from my window. I just kept staring at the pictureâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
