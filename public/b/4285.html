She laughed.</p> <p>"No...I mean...it's not a big deal..."</p> <p>"No, it's not that...it's just..."</p> <p>"What...what's in the bags?" I asked.</p> <p>"We don't do everything together." She said. She started to smile and I thought she was having a good time, even though I knew it was not just a little show.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, what have I done?" I asked her.</p> <p>"We haven't had a chance to talk about what I found out about him and how my mother felt about it all, what you and your mother were doing...I didn't expect anything to come of it." She said.</p> <p>I just sat there for a long moment contemplating what had just happened.</p> <p>"What in the world are you talking about?" I asked her.</p> <p>"He's just, you said it's not a big deal..." She replied, I couldn't hear the words clearly but it seemed like it was an order.</p> <p>I took a deep breath and started to sit up, "Look..." I started, "I never would have thought this. I don't know what it is we're talking about but I don't need to know. I'm really not trying to lead any other direction here."</p> <p>She grabbed my face and kissed me on the cheek, "Let me explain." She said and reached out to give me a hug. I stood up and we held each other close.</p> <p>"I have to tell you something...please don't try to be a tease, or anything. We'll just be friends and that's all." She said trying not to sound as if she were joking.</p> <p>"Sorry, I know I'm trying to sound innocent...but...it's just that...I've never...this stuff with you. No no no no no." I said.</p> <p>She hugged me gently and then looked down and said, "Oh...yes, I know it sounds like...that, but...but...".</p> <p>She turned to walk away, "I guess you're the one that's not...what happened here..."</p> <p>I just shook my head, "We've both enjoyed it. It's not like I've been doing anything with you. I can't be saying or doing anything. You're the only one and I'm happy to be with someone who understands the way I'm feeling."</p> <p>She walked out of the room with a smile on her face and I just sat there for a while, letting the feelings of a relationship that just happened wash over me. I thought about all the times we'd talked, how I could help our friend and not get in trouble with her and how we had talked about how she felt about him. Just being in such an environment with her and how we felt about each other just made me feel alive. I felt like I wanted to be closer to her and I didn't want to be alone.</p> <p>I was not able to concentrate on my own feelings for her and I wasn't able to focus on the feelings I was having for her. My body was betraying me and I was hoping for some physical contact that we would not be able to have. I felt like I was ready to give in to my inner thoughts about the events of the afternoon.</p> <p>I felt so guilty and lost that I had been so caught up in that moment and I felt really confused and vulnerable to her feelings. I started to get worried for the person who had just come over to see me, what was there to do? What was going to come now?</p> <p>It was getting dark and I had had a bath and got into bed, I was trying to sleep but my head was spinning and I was having trouble remembering. I decided to wake up. As I walked out of the bathroom and saw her standing in the door looking at me, there was someone behind me, I could feel it. I couldn't hear her or see a thing but I was sure it was someone. I slowly got out of bed and I heard the door close and heard the light click on as the light came on in the hallway.</p> <p>I tried to wake myself up but my thoughts were spinning wildly around all of the events of today that had taken place during the day and today in general. I was still confused about what happened with them today and I was having a hard time concentrating on what she was saying.</p> <p>I heard a loud groan as she approached me and then she said, "Hello...it's me."</p> <p>She sat next to me at the edgeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
