She muttered. She had no idea how this could possibly do anything or what this could be about. Maybe she ought to just tell the officer she didn't want to be arrested. The police could probably just put her up in a hotel. That felt so weird. How can someone be so trusting and open about trusting someone else?</p> <p>"But Miss...I don't know..." he stammered. "Would you really stop me if I said no?" He asked, hopefully. She looked up at him trying to gauge whether he was serious.</p> <p>"Hm?" She shook her head no. "I think we'll probably get away with it. I'm sure you know some men who'd like the chance to take a guy on a date. Maybe even just to get him to give you a handjob." The words sounded so crude, but there was no way of knowing what to say, in fact the idea of a guy sucking an officer's dick seemed like such an outrageous thing to her.</p> <p>He tried to pull her into a conversation. He had no idea how far she was ready to go, how badly she knew he wouldn't turn out like his ex would. Maybe she was a girl who wanted to be taken advantage of, so maybe this would just be a blowjob, it just felt so right.</p> <p>He could see her eyes narrow up from his dick through his shorts and she was starting to pant. Could she really be wanting to do this? The thought of sucking his cock made her seem so submissive. The idea of having to be used by this officer, a young boy to do what she wanted, was beginning to get to her.</p> <p>Well, he probably didn't want to be taken advantage of by a teenage girl. He had no objection to doing what seemed appropriate. The thought of getting someone so drunk to give him handjobs wasn't really a good way to start his career. Maybe this could just be a blowjob anyway, he decided. Maybe she was just curious and it made her want to do it, it didn't really mean he wanted to give it. Maybe he was just too young to know what a girl really wanted.</p> <p>He was having trouble not feeling too eager to take advantage of her, too.</p> <p>Still...why did this feel so strange to her? How could she feel that he really wanted to do this?</p> <p>"Sorry sir." She sighed. "I was just thinking." He thought she looked so young, so young maybe, so innocent. "Yes, of course this is fine." She managed to say. Still the thoughts of this old man who, in his imagination, she probably had just given him a handjob to make a little more money seemed so crazy. The thought of having to service the officer, to suck his cock, it seemed so ridiculous.</p> <p>"I'll call you when we get out of your station." He smiled down at her, her face was starting to get flushed. "Don't worry so much about being watched I'll take care of you while we're gone." He smiled. "Now you're not just thinking but you're also going to have to do what we say."</p> <p>"Oh sir, you don't know me." She looked down at him. "Oh, I'll try. Whatever happens at your hands is between the two of us. This should not be so bad, right sir?" She looked up at him.</p> <p>He felt a bit guilty. He wondered how he could be the first person in the world to ever do something this kind of strange. He felt like saying he was tired and had to go take care of an old man instead of some kid with a headache. A young girl, a drunk, a teacher, a teenager, the kind of thing the college student had just done and he was going and going and going till he had to stop again.</p> <p>But what if this was all the other men in the world who were the sort of students who were really only interested in helping people. There was no way of telling.</p> <p>"What if we take some of the responsibility for your job, as well." He thought about that, now that he thought he knew someone better. "Just you and me and the officer. That's what we have in mind. Just your name and the fact that I'm the officer on duty." He grinned. "But first, we must get back to this address. I don't have so many questions." He looked back up at the woman, as if looking for some direction to take her. He was really tempted to just try and get her in bed, to get her to go down on him some time soon. That way it wouldn't have to be this way.</p> <p>He thought that sounded good. He thought he had something, or she something, and he was just a boy getting a blowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
