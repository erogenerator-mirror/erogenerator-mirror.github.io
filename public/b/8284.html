He lay there quietly until they came back down, but quickly got back under the covers.</p> <p>"I need your help," she said softly and gently, "I've never been so afraid."</p> <p>"But it's okay; I don't think I'd have much of anything to do." he replied with a smile and she smiled back.</p> <p>Before she'd gotten out of bed he lay on his back, her head on his chest, and he held her, not wanting to let her go, not wanting to lose her. He felt her hand move down, the side of his thigh and then her hand was moving under the covers and slowly he felt her fingers touch his cock. She was looking up at him, and he raised his head looking at her. He took her hand, placing it over the tip of his cock, she squeezed his shaft lightly, making him cry out.</p> <p>"I want to take you in my mouth." she said as she stroked the length of him.</p> <p>His legs spread for her, and she lowered her lips around the head of his cock. "I never knew I could do this." she said as she tasted his pre-cum.</p> <p>"Me either." He laughed and stroked her hair, kissing her neck. "I'll never tell you how much I like the taste of your lips." she kissed him on the lips, and slid her tongue in his mouth and tasted him.</p> <p>He felt her slide down onto him slowly and felt her warm and wetness around him. He felt as if he might cum again with this simple act of lovemaking as she was. He pushed his hips upwards to meet her, he felt the head of his cock push into her when she moved, and he thought he might break as he cried out in pleasure when she slid completely down on him.</p> <p>"Oh no you don't." she cried out and he laughed.</p> <p>"You'll never have to worry about that, will you?" he asked softly.</p> <p>It hadn't dawned on him that he'd been holding her close the night before, and now he was pulling her down with him. She loved it and moved her hips, moving him in and out of her. He looked at her beautiful face as he felt himself filling her up again.</p> <p>He had no intention of stopping, not when he did this. He pulled her down onto him, feeling her body move as she moved. She loved him, he thought. He could feel her body move against him and he felt himself tighten inside. She held him close and felt him pump into her.</p> <p>"That's it Honey," he said, "I'm going to cum inside you."</p> <p>This little thing with lovemaking was fun to watch, and he thought how much he loved fucking. She began moving faster, rubbing herself against him more strongly. She felt him swell inside her and she knew that time was of the essence, the beginning of a truly awesome sexual relationship with another. He held her tight as he felt himself building and he felt himself exploding inside her. They rode him out quietly until it was over and he pulled his soft cock from her.</p> <p>He pulled her on top of him with the sheet and he kissed her lips as the tears started to run down his cheeks.</p> <p>"That was fantastic." he said softly as he held her. "I'm so glad we had this talk."</p> <p>"I know." she said, "You just made me the happiest person in the world."</p> <p>He pulled her close and kissed her, "I meant it when I said I wanted to stay here. If I were you, and if you were in love, it wouldn't have been a problem, would it?"</p> <p>She took his hand and looked at him. "Do you know what I would have done if you'd come with me?" she asked.</p> <p>"Not really." he laughed, "But it would be nice, right? How about it?"</p> <p>"So, can we get together again again?" she asked.</p> <p>"We've never had that much sex in one night" he said with a laugh. "So, that makes two of us!"</p> <p>"I've got the condoms, and I have the lube." she said looking at him. "We've never tried anything like that."</p> <p>"I'd like to experience that as well." he said seriously.</p> <p>She laughed, "Well how about we try?"</p> <p>"Okay, how about you try to get me to do anything you want you know?" he asked.</p> <p>"I don't usually do this." she smiled at him with the same smile he'd been looking at earlier.</p> <p>"I just thought that you could enjoyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
