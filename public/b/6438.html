This is about the best place I could have hoped..." He thought for a moment. "Are you ok?" He asked her, his voice trembling.</p> <p>"Yeah. Go for it but it will only be a minute," she replied.</p> <p>The moment seemed to take forever before, with a sudden, sharp, unexpected shift, the phone finally rang.</p> <p>"Hello," she said, looking away from me.</p> <p>"Um... um... hello. What can I do for you?" she asked.</p> <p>Her voice was timid in tone, and the uncertainty in the word had only left a small quivering smile.</p> <p>"I think we can put the boat off right here, and you will be fine, so I'll need to buy you some clothes. For me. I got you something on, right?"</p> <p>"Yes," she said, with genuine concern. She could hardly wait until the boat was gone. I would have to get my own clothes first. How am I going to pay you when I had to go to work?</p> <p>"It won't change the fact that we never got anything that I am certain you wouldn't like, as a matter of fact, I think I can help you with that," he said.</p> <p>His explanation, and the nervousness she felt, were driving her crazy.</p> <p>"Umm, if I take my shirt off, I guess I should get something on. Will that be a problem?" she asked.</p> <p>"No problem, dear. No problem at all," he said. "No, nothing is out of the ordinary, I guess. This is quite a lovely place to be standing," he said. When she had a firm grip on the chain he attached to it, he quickly pulled her hands aside and placed the clamps on her nipples.</p> <p>"What are you doing? That hurts."</p> <p>"I want to make you happy, and it will get even better for us," he responded. "I am going along with this anyway, so go with me." He started to walk away, holding his hand.</p> <p>"Wait. Stop, please. It hurts?" she asked.</p> <p>With his hand to her mouth, he pressed her back against it, forcing her onto the mattress. He was soon on top of her again, pressing his body down onto hers. He took his free hand, and slowly worked it in between her legs. By now it was his hand against her clit, which was hard with arousal. With his other hand, he unzipped his pants and pulled his already erect member out.</p> <p>"Oh, god, no," she said.</p> <p>"I know. It just hurt... for a moment."</p> <p>She felt his hand on the back of her head again. He had to push it in closer to her face. It felt like a long, delicious cock, with the veins running along the side. She shuddered as it pressed down on her lips. He was holding her as if she was his, and forcing himself in slowly, almost as if he wanted to get himself all the way inside.</p> <p>When the first inch became an inch she tried to pull back. Her lips were locked, trying to stop him. After a moment, she began to resist, but her struggles quickly turned into whimpers and moans, which only made him push another inch past.</p> <p>"That's good girl," he murmured. "You like it, don't you? You like having a cock in you, don't you?"</p> <p>She continued the resistance. But, even though she began to relax she never wanted it to stop. She wasn't sure if she would like it, she thought. She was sure that if he kept pushing, then she would never get this feeling again.</p> <p>He took his hand away, and as his hand came back with his cock head, she opened her eyes.</p> <p>"What the hell is wrong with me? Is this what men like?" she whispered.</p> <p>She knew that he was telling the truth. This was about him, and she was sure that she could be his, if he wanted to be. She let herself relax as he continued to push his cock into her mouth further.</p> <p>In all the years since she'd had sex with a guy, there had been a time when she had considered herself attractive, but never actually had someone else. Even with someone as inexperienced as John, she was still a first-year graduate of the class. But this man, who, at first glance, seemed to be so different from the boys that she'd had sex with. This cock she held in her hand, now pressing into her mouth, while she struggled with one hand, trying to pull his cock to her lips as she struggled in her bonds with her own freeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
