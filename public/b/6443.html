I followed in moments later.</p> <p>“Do you have any idea what I want to talk to you about?” I asked. “”Just in case we can only talk like this.”</p> <p>“Yeah, well,” she paused. “It’s time.” “I’m trying to talk about some things that I know you want to, and what I think you can give to my body.”</p> <p>“Do you even know what I want to do?” “No, I guess not.”</p> <p>“I want to see what it takes. I’ve been looking at everything that has happened in the past, and I don’t think I can wait any more.” She paused. “I could ask you anything personal. In fact, I want to do it right here. Do you want to meet me?”</p> <p>“Do you really want me to come for our second time?”</p> <p>“I do, but now is not the time. I’ve been wondering what your body feels like.”</p> <p>“Oh, that’s not an old answer.”</p> <p>“I know, but I do want it.”</p> <p>I’m a little afraid to try to give it to her, but I can.”</p> <p>She kissed me again, then asked, “Do you have a boyfriend, now you can tell me.”</p> <p>It was a new one.</p> <p>“No, but I like to hear you say it.”</p> <p>“But I thought we were going to do it every time we met.”</p> <p>“I know, but now I want us to have a private time together.”</p> <p>“Why do you want to come topless again?”</p> <p>“You’re just so wonderful to talk about.”</p> <p>Her face showed her happiness. “I could lie down on my side next to you and you could do most of the talking.”</p> <p>We lay like that, until I realized I had been holding a lot longer than I planned. She finally said, “You want to see my breasts for a while?”</p> <p>“Sure.”</p> <p>“I thought we could just watch.”</p> <p>“We can’t have that.”</p> <p>“I’ll keep that in mind if we need too.”</p> <p>About ten minutes after I had my answer, she rolled over and said, “OK, we can get a little comfortable now.” And she rolled to her back, but didn’t turn around. I was going to say something later, but I got an erection anyway.</p> <p>We lay there in the darkness, looking at each other. Her breast had a little pink nipple on the outside. I couldn’t believe how different it felt, even for me. I started tracing my fingers across her areola while she closed her eyes. When I got to the breast I took the nipple and gently rolled it around. Her eyes closed and she let out a little moan. I slowly moved the nipple around with my thumb on each breast then switched to the other nipple, rolling it along. She moaned a little louder. I gently licked the nipple, which got very hard. The soft skin on my face felt so soft against the smooth skin of her breast. I took her other nipple into my mouth to do the same. My hand gently traced one area or the other as she watched me. When I felt that we were both getting close to it, I switched to the other.</p> <p>“You are beautiful,” I said.</p> <p>“It’s a shame you don’t want to try to do everything you were suggesting,” she replied.</p> <p>“Sure, that should be no problem, but I can’t think of the last time you have been as soft as you are.”</p> <p>“I’m sorry, but do you have anything with that I can show you?”—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
