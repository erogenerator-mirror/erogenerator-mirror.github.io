You have no idea!"</p> <p>"I've been practicing a lot that's why I came up here tonight. I'm just having a bit of a fun for awhile since I haven't had any company in the last three weeks."</p> <p>"You had company? With some random stranger?"</p> <p>"You had me last night and while my pussy is sore like hell today he does. I'm sure he wanted to fuck me too which leads me to know all my secrets I guess."</p> <p>"If he wanted to fuck you he could have, I just didn't think about it."</p> <p>"Do you really think him trying to sleep in the same bed you slept with last week? Don't tell me he's done it more than once!"</p> <p>"Well I don't think that makes any sense because his cock felt too good when it was in me this morning! Does he do it more than once?"</p> <p>"Not every night but sometimes he does. He usually lasts about thirty seconds after he's in me, it feels like he just came in me for a minute."</p> <p>"Oh my gosh, you're kidding."</p> <p>I went over the same ground again and tried to think of a way to get it out of her if it came to naught in this town I would be the one calling the cops.</p> <p>"I know you're all pissed off but would you be willing to try?"</p> <p>"What?" Her reply was like a bolt out the door of a trap door.</p> <p>"It's not too strange I suppose it's just that I'm not sure if he's the right guy for you."</p> <p>There was a bit of silence after that. We waited a couple of minutes and started to talk again. I don't know what was said that night but I'm certain that it did nothing for her at all. It appeared that I was the only one of the group that was not happy with our idea but for some reason she didn't want to go along with it. I have to say that it felt good to be talked to like that after what we had done.</p> <p>"So I can ask you one more thing, is it something you'd rather have happen with someone else now that it's been over. Is it a one time thing?"</p> <p>"It might be but there's this one time. I don't feel guilty about it. I love him and I think he feels the same way but I've never asked him to do it because I don't think it would break him. He loves me too so much and I don't care what other guys think. I know that if I had asked him to do it I'd never have to go through with it."</p> <p>"What about those other guys you were with before? Do you know anyone who would willingly do it."</p> <p>"They're probably just as repulsed by it as the rest of us." He wasn't giving her a chance to answer which she didn't have until after he had finished his coffee.</p> <p>"Well you really want it all to stop because you know that I really hope you two were going to do it, right?"</p> <p>Now this was becoming a nightmare, I couldn't bring myself to do it. I was already telling her that I wanted to fuck her and that was the only thing between me and my destiny. She would never agree to have this sex thing, that wasn't the whole ball. I knew that it might work and that all the other guys would take it to heart and be a big piece of ass.</p> <p>"No, I love you but we really can't. We just need to talk about this."</p> <p>We hung out for four more pleasant days and then she went home about two weeks later.</p> <p>In the meantime I tried my damnedest to keep everything on the right track. I got myself settled into the job that I loved and even got a condo and a couple of people that I needed to meet again when I was ready. Then things started to click for the last time. The last thing you'd think is that some one were going to walk in on a one time thing.</p> <p>It had just been spring break and the next time they would be there they would be at the door looking different. What was the worst of all would be if they came home and saw her in the bedroom and they'd say nothing but they couldn't stop smiling and staring at her. They should walk right past me and say the same thing but no. No. That wouldn't happen. It had to go one way or another. Then we'd be alone together. I got it from my heart and my soul that she didn't want to do it or because of some other thing and now that it was over and they were going to be friends you had betterâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
