She was wearing a short white silk robe, which hung at her midriff to just barely cover her hips, but was wrapped half around her legs nicely. Her breasts looked good enough that for the first time I could imagine them spilling out over the top. "What do you think?"</p> <p>"You look fantastic."</p> <p>"Thanks, but this is getting out of hand."</p> <p>"It's my responsibility to ensure it's properly fitted."</p> <p>Without preamble, I gave her a big hug and then pulled her in toward me. "Gees, babe, I'm not really looking forward to this, not that you're the only one."</p> <p>She pressed herself between me and the fireplace and smiled sweetly at me. "I hope you understand, but right now I think we're both feeling a little warm."</p> <p>"I'm sure we are," I agreed. "But let's not take the heat up any higher, shall we?"</p> <p>She gave me another kiss before pulling away to turn and take me right by it, and without any fanfare, we were both on our knees on the sofa, looking up at the ceiling. "My feet are killing me," Anna said with a grin. "Please stand up."</p> <p>I did just as she asked and she took hold of both of my hands, and then helped me from the sofa. "Are you feeling pretty warm down there?" she asked softly.</p> <p>"I'm pretty damn good."</p> <p>"That's nice, but it can't last for long if you don't start feeling something."</p> <p>I looked up at us with a broad grin, and then stood to give her a peck on her neck. She rubbed my arms and then pulled the hem of my shirt up just a bit so that I could step it up and slide it off my forearms. She took one of my hands and led it straight to the waistband of her panties, which were straining to contain my cock.</p> <p>"And this?" Anna giggled, as she rubbed my dick through the fabric. "It's going to look amazing if we get lucky, but it's my turn first."</p> <p>So we both stood up in the middle of the room, and Anna leaned in to kiss me. I felt her tongue slide into the warmth of my mouth as fast as I felt it. Her lips tasted even better on my body, and for a second, I saw her in all her sultry beauty. I don't think I'd ever felt anything like it before. And I think she was the first who'd ever kissed me after I'd been with a total stranger. As hot as those lips pressed against mine, it was also much easier to imagine her tasting myself. That thought alone would take me to heaven.</p> <p>"I'm ready," Anna said as I lowered her down into the couch, turning to put her arms under her, and kissing her right there on the spot where her breasts met her rib cage. "I'm sure you will too. When we get to the first dance floor, I promise I'll have your dick in my hand all night."</p> <p>"I wish you wouldn't." Her hips were pumping with renewed vigor, which I already knew, and then we were doing everything we could to keep the conversation low as we both reached ecstasy. "I guess I can't wait now," she said between long breaths.</p> <p>"I can't either," I responded, not even knowing what the best answer would be.</p> <p>We kissed some more, and then lay her out on top of the sofa in her robe, and then lay her back in the classic sixty nine position, our legs overlapping between hers and our hands reaching out, and each hand caressing the other. The next song began, and as I was working my way into the rhythm, Anna's thighs rose to meet mine and then slowly began to part with my fingers as her hips pushed back and we met in the middle between each of our bodies with a sensual dance that both knew we couldn't slow down or not want to. There was just a hint of a smile on my face when Anna's eyes were closed, as she had done for me before. And as our kissing became more and more passionate, she began to moan more and more fervently, her lips and her voice strumming as her hips continued to thrust more and more urgently against mine, and then it appeared that, for the first time, this was the right song for Anna.</p> <p>She looked up at me as we continued to kiss. "I want to try everything with you," she said, and slid her tongue into my mouth.</p> <p>"And I want to try everything with you, too."</p> <p>Her eyes were still closed and her head was against my shoulders. "I'm in love with you. I can't waitâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
