That connection they both felt it in their bodies, and in time. That knowledge sent out a shiver that raced up and past his heart to his cock. He watched her, watching her eyes as she sat up and began to slowly crawl off the bed. His cock, already throbbing, was ready to explode. He watched her as she slowly pulled her panties off, and tossed them to the floor. She then stood slowly, her face downcast, her eyes closed. He grabbed his cock and started rubbing it slowly in his hand, his voice low in his throat, "I need you now," he moaned.</p> <p>As she turned and moved into the bathroom he entered. It seemed like an eternity since he would take a girl. She walked past him, almost running into the men's washroom and dropping her panties. Her eyes locked on his as she bent forward and slowly pulled her panties down. She pulled her panties down to her knees as she turned and began to slowly move towards her stall. His words were not lost on her as she heard him walk behind her, "you're wet!"</p> <p>"Fuck me, fuck me now!"</p> <p>Jade turned around and turned the shower on. She could see him entering the shower, his eyes closed as he started to wash himself. His eyes were still closed when she opened and shut the curtain and turned. His eyes didn't return her gaze as they took in her naked form. Her lips were moist inviting them, "Fuck me...!" she hissed. He did. He moved forward and she held onto his back. She pulled him on top of her and began to run her hands up and down his back, his legs gripping her hips, "honey, I need you here." He lifted up his face and looked in her eyes. His mouth was close to hers, but barely a touch, instead moving towards her mouth. She felt his tongue, licking, his lips, his mouth, and his tongue. His hands reached under her ass and lifted her as he slowly guided his cock into her. He looked down and saw her lips open a bit and her eyes as they looked out the side of the curtain, "hope you feel as good as you look," he whispered as his cock began to glide in to her. "Oh fuck!" he moaned as he slid into her.</p> <p>Jade wrapped her legs around his waist and her arms around his neck. His hands were on her shoulders, pressing down into her back, as he started to fuck her.</p> <p>The shower continued for about ten minutes, the water cascading down his body and soaking into them. She let go of his shoulder to reach for the shower curtain. "Turn it off," she said and quickly turned around, trying to turn out the water only to find it too hot. Her eyes opened as she felt his hands grip her waist and his cock slide out of her. She leaned in towards him as she held the curtain shut. Her body turned and turned, feeling the warmth of his body in hers. His mouth came down onto hers again, and she felt herself wanting him. Her hands moved around to grasp his chest and chest, pulling him towards her. His hands lifted her into the shower. She was ready for him to claim her when the water stopped and his lips brushed her lips. Jade was stunned as she could taste his mouth, feel him's hands and feel his cock as he took her into him... his hands sliding down her sides and then back up. "Oh god!" she moaned as his hands cupped her ass. The heat of his fingers found her wetness, felt the muscles contracting around his fingers. And she arched into his hands.</p> <p>Finally she felt him lifting her off the ground and standing. She turned around and grabbed his cock. She looked into his eyes as he wrapped his arms around her waist and pulled her down on the floor. With her legs wrapped around his waist and her feet resting on his shoulders, she could not see the look of lust on his face. She could see his desire... hers... for his cock, knowing as they moved down the stairs that it would be. For her. For her.</p> <p>She smiled up at him, her mouth close to his ear. "Fuck me" she said softly. As he leaned down to kiss herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
