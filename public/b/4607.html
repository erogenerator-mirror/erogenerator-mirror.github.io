You both laughed, and with that, he began caressing your body. His hands drifted up to your breasts and you felt his fingers pinching your nipples. You moaned, and your hand slid down his body. Your legs opened as he found your pussy. You moaned in pleasure as you felt his tongue on your clit then, he sucked it into his mouth and began tongue fucking your pussy. You were ready, almost screaming, you were almost there. He continued fucking you with his tongue until you felt him suck a finger into your pussy and, as his mouth left your clit, you screamed, "Fuck me!"</p> <p>With another quick move, he moved his body on top of yours. He was so close to your pussy again, but he pushed his hips forward, and in you came, right over his mouth. There was no need for any foreplay - after your first orgasm you had wanted his cock inside you and now it was almost in again.</p> <p>As you were gasping for breath, you said, "Thank you, that was..." then you froze, you didn't know what to say.</p> <p>"Oh, my god, did I really have to do that, for me..."</p> <p>"Yes, you did, and your reaction was very positive," he said with a smile. He moved to stand and you moved to him. He put his arms around her, and she slid down his body. You both groaned, as he was touching every inch of you.</p> <p>His arms went around you, and she began kissing him, and he moved closer. She leaned her face into his, and began to lick his lips. His hands cupping your ass, and pulling you close, he pulled you tighter against him. You moaned into his mouth. She kissed him, sucking his lip. He grabbed your ass again, pulling it off the sofa, and she slid his hand into her thong, while you were kissing him. He moved his kisses down your neck, and his hands found your breasts, tweaking your nipples. Your mouth found his chest and your nipples. He began to pinch your breast, pulling, lifting. You moaned into his mouth, and his hands slid up to your ass, and he pulled you closer against him and his cock. You knew what was about to happen and begged him to fuck you, to fill you, to fuck you with his cock. It took only a minute, but you came again and again, as you were on the pill.</p> <p>"My God, I think I've never ... anything like that ... ever happened to me. Oh my god, fuck me..." he whispered, before kissing you. You could taste yourself on his lips. You lifted your arms and wrapped them around him, holding him close. "It's not fair ..."</p> <p>He laughed, "I've tasted you too, but it is fair, isn't it?" With that, he kissed you again, and they fucked. You came over and over again, as he slid his cock into you. You began to cum again, and your juices covered his cock, thighs, and his balls. You screamed, and he came, and your arms and legs wrapped themselves, around him. You came one last time and collapsed on the sofa with him still inside you. "I knew I would have to fuck you the right way," he whispered, and you grinned, knowing that it was not a game you'd been playing. They both had an empty sofa, and were kissing each other, as they rested their heads back on either side.</p> <p>"I wish we could stay there. That was ..."</p> <p>"No, but let's get some sleepâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
