"Who's a 'Goddess of the sea?' How the hell is she going to be able to do this with her mind on the job? What the hell are you up to!?" Leanne hissed out in anger, she suddenly wanted to punch Lea in the face, but she had no chance of it as Leanne had the strength of fifteen stone under her. The first blow of the attack landed, hitting the back of Leanne's head and leaving a blood trail behind. The second blow came with force and with little more than a few cuts to her right cheek. Leanne fell to the ground in a sputtering heap.</p> <p>Zoe was already on her, pinning her down with one arm and restraining her right arm with one hand and squeezing a chunk of her shoulder. Her hand was a blur as it slammed into her side, causing a deep cut on her thigh. "Is that the name of your fucking brain of a weapon you've been carrying in the past?"</p> <p>Leanne blinked her eyes to clear them before he continued, "Is there no way you can be aware of the threat in your mind, but what do you mean by that?"</p> <p>"There was nothing to see," Zoe retorted, "And with your body in the way it might just as well have never surfaced, it wouldn't have been much of a threat." A glimmer of anger flashed in her eyes.</p> <p>Leanne looked up and was met with a cold stare from Leanne. "I was born with all that power in front of me," Zoe said, "You'll never know if we don't have powers in our heads, or if we don't exist anymore."</p> <p>"How about you?" Leanne shot back with the same determined gaze that had come over her in the past. Leanne nodded her head and gave a tired smile. "I guess we're ready to head home," Zoe smiled. "Good luck with your 'gift.' I can't guarantee if you'll ever actually get used to being the 'Goddess of the sea,' but if you have the energy to do anything about it, we're willing to wait. I'll just have to come back for more power. You can probably practice walking to practice how the energy works, which will make it easier to control."</p> <p>Leanne smiled as she looked at me. "I'm sure you can do that, I always do."</p> <p>Zoe looked over at me and raised an eyebrow. "And maybe you too?" Zoe asked playfully. Zoe nodded. "I guess we'll see. Don't do anything stupid now," she said.</p> <p>Leanne just looked up and shook her head, as if it was the most natural thing in the world to do. There was a flash of a smile that nearly brought tears to her eyes. "We had better stop now. The party is getting a little late," she said, rising.</p> <p>"Well it's all here, we'll be back," I told Leanne.</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess so, the guys will be back any second," Zoe agreed, "So I guess I better go take a shower."</p> <p>Leanne turned to Leanne. "No, stay here," she told her.</p> <p>Leanne turned her back to her. "I won't be back here for another eight hours," she said.</p> <p>"Don't forget about the keys to my apartment," Zoe said as she walked over to me. "If you ever need me."</p> <p>"Can you call them as quick as you can and tell me what's wrong?" Leanne asked back.</p> <p>"I'll have my lawyer contact her," Zoe told her as she gave Leanne a kiss.</p> <p>Zoe and Leanne left for home and I was left alone to take over this whole project. The only person I knew who knew exactly how the powers worked was Zoe. So it was just a matter of time between the two, then that's what I did.</p> <p>The rest of the week passed in a blur of pain and frustration. I decided that it was worth a try and walked out of there. The rest of the day dragged and my anger, frustration and disappointment were so intense that I was unable to concentrate. I felt like I was about to explode.</p> <p>Friday night found me sitting in the bar. Leanne came in, sat in the booth next to me. In my mind I felt like I should have been able to take her with my fists, but then I went home. Zoe was there with them. They were both naked and making out in her living room. All I did was stand and run after them, but I felt so foolish running away. I would never have been able to face Leanne, but she knew how to keep me from leaving.</p> <p>Leanne smiled at me.
