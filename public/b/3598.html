"Do you want to come all the way back here, now?"</p> <p>"I think I might."</p> <p>"But just in time, is that what you really wanted?" I inquired.</p> <p>"I thought you would say that," Emily conceded. "Now is probably something you will not want to do to the person you're married or have kids with. That would be a very poor choice of words."</p> <p>"Okay. You have my word." The words came to my mouth with a sudden clarity. "Emily, take your panties down right now, for God's sake," I suggested; my voice more authoritative than I meant to, perhaps the other part of my brain, too frightened to do anything but obey.</p> <p>"Why, of course I'll do that, but you're right. You're a good person, I mean Emily, and I don't think we can go back."</p> <p>"I don't think we can either; I've already committed and committed to it."</p> <p>"Well then, I'll just leave it to Emily."</p> <p>"No, wait. You'll just follow my lead," Emily agreed. She knew that her command over me would be met with some response, too. And in that moment I felt as though I trusted her as much as I had ever trusted anyone before. To have made the decision was the last thing I needed at all. "No, wait. Take your panties off, for God's sake."</p> <p>The answer to that invitation was simple enough. I put my fingers in the waistline of my panties, and, to my surprise, they slid to the floor. I had not worn any underwear on this trip, so when I touched it, the sensation was almost immediate. My pussy responded instantly, and my legs tightened as I rubbed my pussy. I pulled my panties aside to reveal only the barest hint of my cunt. I slid my fingers slowly along my outer lips, savoring the feeling of the fabric rubbing against my cunt in the tight, moist confines of my cunt.</p> <p>Now that things were different from the way I was accustomed to them, it was even more exciting for me to be exposing myself with nothing but the underwear to the outside world. I spread my legs a bit, just a bit to give myself a little extra cushioning. Emily continued to rub her fingers on the outside of the opening of my cunt, and I could feel my inner folds swelling with arousal, opening up more as I let my breathing deepen. Emily noticed this, and pressed her fingers harder between my inner lips, sliding her fingers along my opening and into my cunt. I moaned at the delicious feelings of that contact, and spread my legs even wider, welcoming it with equal fervor. Emily kept that up, making her way in and out of my cunt with almost two feet of fingering my cunt, at the same time. I could feel my cunt contracting and soaking my panties with my juices, and my stomach fluttering and my legs shivering. My mind was swimming in a sea of bliss.</p> <p>"You're absolutely right," Emily responded, her hands still working my cunt as she fingered it. "Oh, God, so close! Do it, Emily or I won't be able to walk home."</p> <p>I nodded in understanding, "yes, Emily, do it."</p> <p>After a moment, Emily pushed the fingers deep into my cunt and, after a brief pause, rotated them around, and then back to the front. I had to concentrate to catch my breath as Emily continued to massage the walls of my cunt with her fingers. Her tongue went in and out of my cunt, her tongue tasting me. Her lips, the sides of her mouth, and even my breasts, her tongue still licking my cunt.</p> <p>Emily, the only person besides our spouses I have met, seemed to know exactly what I liked, and how to please it. Without breaking stride, she continued stroking my cunt with her magic tongue, driving me toward orgasm. Her tongue was so long it tickled my flesh, and she continued to press against my clitoris with her nose, her face pressing into mine, her lips on my neck. Her body pressed her body down and ground against mine with every motion. Her nipples felt hard, and I could feel her body stiffen beneath me. When I moved my head toward the windshield, she turned her head to face my ear and gave a few quick gasps as though she enjoyed being on the receiving end.</p> <p>"I'm so close, I'm so close. Oh, Emily, yes!" I exclaimed. She didn't know that it was coming, but I had the distinct feeling that she was having the sameâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
