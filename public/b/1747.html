We met Fred, a small but good-looking young guy sitting and sitting at our booth. When we got back to the house, we went into the bathroom, changed and went to bed early.</p> <p>We talked about what we'd been up to, but Fred was too shy to say anything. I knew he worked a lot, so I assumed he probably hadn't given a lot of thought to what to wear when he went to bed. I got undressed, put on my robe and crawled into bed next to him. He turned to me and said, "Come over here," and he got into bed with me. He started kissing down my neck. I turned and laid my head back as he kissed down to my chest. I felt his hand under my gown and felt his hand moving down. I opened my legs so he could move under the covers. When he was done, he laid next to me and we kissed. He held my hand while he caressed up and down my arm. When he moved to my body, he was stroking me slowly.</p> <p>When he did move to my penis, I felt him take it in his hand and stroke it. It didn't take long before it was rock hard and I felt his mouth on my head. He kissed him hard and he kissed on down. When he got to my penis, he took it in his mouth and sucked on it. I was feeling great. I was getting turned on by what he was doing. After only a few minutes, I was getting ready to come. I didn't care, I just wanted something that I always liked. I could tell by his motions that he was trying, but it seemed to last for about half a minute when he stopped and his mouth on me went back to my penis.</p> <p>When his mouth left me, he pulled my panties down and got some lotion on his hand. He pushed it into my bottom and used his middle finger to probe me. He moved his finger in and out, stopping when it was well lubricated. Then he added a second finger and pushed it in. I was ready when I felt his fingers on my anus and he made sure they went in deep. He moved his fingers away and I felt him lube me up. He was a big man and I liked that with him. When his fingers were in me, he moved his thumb and thumb together and found my prostate. I felt it with his thumb as he moved his fingers in and out. I was getting very turned on knowing he wanted me to come in his mouth, but I didn't care, I was about to come.</p> <p>It seemed like it only a matter of seconds before I got to the point of no return. My hips pushed up against his fingers. At the same time, I felt his fingers pressing into both sides of my bottom, and I felt that feeling that comes with an orgasm. I could feel what I mean when I thought I heard him moan. It was a sign that my orgasm started and I came hard. That was great, especially when my hips pushed up into his hand when I was done.</p> <p>"Do you like that?" he asked.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Do I like that?"</p> <p>"Uh-huh....."</p> <p>"Have you ever gotten a blowjob?"</p> <p>"Well, uh, I guess not."</p> <p>"Well, uh, not that I'm trying to tell you this. I just want you to think I'm a good guy. But I want you to think of me as a man and not a child. Maybe once, when we were alone."</p> <p>I felt his breath on my neck in a way that told me he was trying to calm me down. He seemed to read my thoughts because he let go of me and said, "That's all right. No harm in trying." I felt more relaxed with him because I knew what he wanted, I just didn't know what he wanted.</p> <p>"You're right. But we better get that night a dream." He lifted his head and smiled, "Let's go and have dinner together."</p> <p>As I got up to go to the bathroom, he said, "Go slow. I'll be back in a little while."</p> <p>When I got back to the table, he was waiting for me with a glass of wine. I noticed that he seemed to have a bit of a hard-on and it looked like it was going to get larger.</p> <p>"Do you want me to get you another wine?" I asked him.</p> <p>"No, I'm fine. I'm just not used to wine."</p> <p>It was a bit of a shock when he came and sat down across from me. He reached over and sat downâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
