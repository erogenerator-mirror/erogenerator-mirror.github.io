I can't have any more of that now," she said, grinning, and giving me little kisses.</p> <p>That didn't really matter, as I lay there, as we talked, she reached out her hand and caressed my cheek. I kissed it lightly, and she sighed, then turned off the bed. I got up, stood at the door, and watched her. She looked like a cat. Beautiful and vulnerable. And, yet, so damned sexy, as the night faded into our sleep.</p> <p>"The night is young, sweetie," she said. "I think we'll have lots of time to spend in bed together."</p> <p>We climbed down and into bed together. She fell over into my arms, snuggling her face into my chest, my arm around her waist. We kissed softly and long, for the next hour. And, the time slipped away, and our kisses became more erotic. I caressed her, as she lay half on me, half on my stomach. I kissed her face, her brow, her ear - not on her face, but her earlobes - as I massaged her body.</p> <p>"You're so nice to me," she said in a half-giggle. "I don't know ... it's been so long for me, sweetie. It really is the only thing in my life anyone else ever does for me that feels this good."</p> <p>"Mmmmmm! It's the only thing in my life," I said.</p> <p>"But you always said it was only 'one thing' too - that you did it for more than just sex."</p> <p>"Oh, yes, honey," I answered.</p> <p>We kissed again, and her hand drifted onto my chest and started caressing me. I kissed my way down from her face to her mouth, and she moaned as I tongued her. When I reached down to her, she was already getting her first handjob. She moaned even louder, a small hoot as I sucked her nipple into my mouth.</p> <p>As her body began to respond, I turned onto my side and drew her on top of me. I had never been with a woman like this before. The sensations on my penis and nipples were amazing. As good as their mutual sex was, I don't think I'd ever been as turned on as this one - and I felt like I was going to orgasm soon. I didn't even mind at all after sucking her breasts, or having her roll over on top me. But, I was never going to last long, not with the excitement of two of the best-fucked women I'd ever fucked. She lifted herself off me, and put her arms around me. I felt her vagina wrap around my stiff cock, and she began moving slowly up and down. I couldn't hold back, as she rode me to the hilt, pushing her pussy down harder on me in response to the sensation. I began to feel my climax beginning in my balls, and then I filled her completely with my semen, as her own climax sent her body into convulsive jerks.</p> <p>They were the most memorable orgasms I had ever had in one session and I could not stop. I don't think I'd even gotten my cock all the way up to her cervix before my hips bucked against hers. She screamed into my neck, and collapsed on top of me. For all I knew we could have cum on any part of the way down there. We fell asleep together on the sheets.</p> <p>**********</p> <p>We woke early, with the early morning sun lighting the curtains. We lay there kissing and caressing each other. Then we got up, went to shower after our shower. We went to our respective rooms, and she dressed for work as I changed. As we got dressed, I admired her body again in the mirror.</p> <p>"You're looking really good, Holly," I said. "You're so sexy. You know that? And you can tell the kind of boy I look at when I'm horny, right?"</p> <p>"All girls are sexy, right?" she asked. "And I don't think I look at many boys as sexy as them."</p> <p>"I don't think any girl looked at 'them' as much as you do," I agreed, and we headed to work. We were both dressed in slacks today in business appropriate dresses. Since she wasn't going to run up the skirt of the skirt, I wore a sleeveless cotton summer dress, with the top buttons undone, as she wore a suit jacket. We sat down to share a cup of coffee at the coffee shop where we'd agreed to meet, and we started working.</p> <p>At quitting time, we saw the line out on the sidewalk to go down the street to the restaurant. We got a roomâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
