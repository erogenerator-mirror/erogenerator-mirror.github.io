"We are the 'two'. This is our lives."</p> <p>"I am sure you are right, Amanda," he said with his hand in hers.</p> <p>They spent a moment examining each other's nails before saying their goodbyes. "We are coming up with a beautiful plan to spend the weekend with you," he said as he kissed her hand and said, "If you wish, we can go out on the town on Saturday night." She smiled at the prospect. "Do you want me to pick you up at your apartment on Saturday, too?"</p> <p>It sounded like it would be a nice way to get on with his life. "I would like that very much," she said as she kissed him on the cheek. "Why don't we go pick up somewhere near the airport around 6:30? You can take me out to dinner, if you like, and have a long, relaxing evening."</p> <p>"I'll grab dinner at the airport around six," he said with a smile. "I'll also need to order room service tomorrow. Are you ready to go, by yourself?"</p> <p>She laughed. "I'm sure there will be plenty of room in there for you," she said to make sure she didn't have forgotten something.</p> <p>"As I tell you, yes, my bed is really all you need," he said with another smile.</p> <p>"And just keep the room full, okay?"</p> <p>"Yes, sir!"</p> <p>***</p> <p>Once on the plane, the four of them talked about their weekend and the plans they had. The four of them went to a local sushi restaurant and were seated in a secluded corner. Amanda had made a reservation for 6:00. It was a beautiful night and the restaurant was open. The four of them were having a very pleasant time, enjoying their sushi and talking as they always did. When Amanda felt like she was going to start something she stood and took a sip of wine as she took her seat. Before heading out into the night, she took off her bra. It was easy to hide her bra behind one of the large, plush cushioning in the middle of the cushions. Then she slowly unbuttoned her blouse. When she was bare-assed in the front seat, she took off the top button and slipped the jacket off. Turning sideways, she unzipped her skirt and let it drop. At the last minute, she sat back down with a sexy smile on her lips. Turning sideways again, she sat sideways and let her blouse drop to the floor. Then, as she sat back from the rear, she unbuttoned her shirt and unhooked her bra. Pulling it off as well, she tossed it to the side and slid the straps off her shoulders to take another sip of wine. After letting a sip of the wine, she again turned sideways, but now lay back.</p> <p>She didn't stop to consider it. She knew she could not stop this with her legs spread. She knew what she would do if he wanted her to. He did not. The fact that he wanted her to have this in mind made her feel like a desirable slut. In fact, it turned her on knowing he was going to be fucking her later tonight. She was not thinking clearly but knew the opportunity was there and the plan was to keep getting her horny before the night was over. She decided to take a sip. Slowly, she took a drink. When she had stopped, she leaned all the way forward and took her wine glass from the table. As she leaned against the cushion, her blouse draped, the buttons just barely holding it closed.</p> <p>As they drove to the restaurant, her nipples were visible through her blouse. She decided to get as drunk as she could but only in anticipation. The alcohol had also taken a lot of effect on her and she felt incredibly sexy as she drove. The thought of being with him, of being made love to, of him making love to her only fueled her lust. She could feel herself getting moist.</p> <p>As they drove, Amanda's mind wandered. She took in every detail as she parked up, then took her car keys out of the glove box and started to open the door for him. She slid her seat back a little and opened her car door. Stepping out of her red miniskirt, she slid across the carpet and headed into the restaurant.</p> <p>Amanda and her date were seated together in the booth with the waiter. His hands were up her back and she could feel his cool hands against her skin as they touched her. At first they had the conversation all planned out as he set the table. She didn't want him making love to her, just touching her. When he touched her, she jumped.</p> <p>"Do you want to stopâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
