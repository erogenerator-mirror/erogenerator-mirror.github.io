He told Mandy as he stood up and headed towards her.</p> <p>"No, not really." Mandy replied as she looked over at Josh.</p> <p>"You're not a model are you?" Mandy teased as she reached up and ran her hand over his bulge.</p> <p>Josh grabbed her hand and squeezed it firmly. "I was kidding. We haven't done anything yet." He told her as she grabbed her shirt.</p> <p>"Let me go to the bedroom and change." Mandy told him. "I'll be there in a second."</p> <p>After a second Josh took his camera out. "Ok, see you around." He told her as he left her house. She didn't have the heart to tell him she wasn't leaving again for fear it would make the shoot even hotter. There was no way her pussy would allow her to feel it or talk about it.</p> <p>Josh left the house and walked down the drive towards the studio. He wasn't sure why Mandy had agreed to take a chance on actually showing him her goods. He had always been a guy who liked to look too much and was only interested in a good looking woman to be the subject on the end of a shoot. And now that that was his reality he was just glad it wasn't going to be any fun, since it was definitely going to be fun. The truth was that Josh didn't know how he was going to handle the situation he had just created. He had a million thoughts running through his head. He really wanted to see Mandy in the flesh in all her glory. But what about Mandy? She was just his friend. What were the odds of a photo ever being set up with a guy that was into her, or not? Was Mandy even going to go through with it? It couldn't go on in real life, could it? And what about her? What if she said no? "Don't worry about it, we'll do it. We'll have a good time. Come again!" Josh told himself as he approached the house. When he got there he heard the light on in the bedroom.</p> <p>"Come on in Josh. I have another shoot to do." Mandy said cheerfully as Josh walked into the room. Mandy quickly got out of bed and walked straight over to Josh. She started to run her hands up and down his chest as they kissed. "Let's get this photo done." Mandy said as she kissed him again. Mandy ran her right hand up and down Josh's crotch. As they kissed Josh moved his hands slowly down her back until he reached her ass. Mandy pushed her body against Josh's to increase the contact with her, and Josh continued to run his hands over her ass and thighs. He wanted to feel how soft and firm her ass was. He was just thinking about that. As the kiss grew in intensity Josh continued to run his hands over her ass. He could feel her ass pressing hard against his already hardening cock for what had to be the first time in less than twelve hours. Mandy lifted her body off of Josh, breaking the kiss. She looked at the camera for a second wondering what Josh was thinking about. She smiled as she ran her hands down her body. She loved the feeling of Josh's hands on the small of her back.</p> <p>"Let's get you on your back Mandy" Josh said as he grabbed her and rolled over onto his back. Mandy quickly turned her body and straddled Josh's waist. Her hand slowly rubbed over Josh's throbbing cock and she lowered herself down on him. Josh's eyes were closed while he savored the feel of her pussy. They were definitely not the kind of couple that went the long way around. They were more like two horny teenagers who had just taken it to the next level. Mandy pushed herself down, taking his entire cock inside of her and moving herself up and down his shaft. He wrapped his hands around her hips to support himself. Mandy started to move her body faster now and Josh's arms went up around her. She looked over his body and smiled. "Nice! I know you like this." Mandy told him softly before continuing to move herself up and down his cock. Josh's moans were getting louder as she continued to ride him. She looked down at his face and watched it go back into focus. Josh's eyes were closed now but he was just enjoying her motions and she felt him getting closer to cumming. "Now! Cum with me!" She told him in a breathy voice. Josh's hips pushed up at her just a little harder as she rode him. Suddenly Josh came.</p> <p>"Uhmmm...Uhmmm." Mandy let out a huge sigh as she pushed herself down, feeling his warm cum flood her pussy and filling up her up with such a nice feeling. She feltâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
