Maybe that's a good sign. Maybe she was a little more open-minded than he thought. In any case, he felt it would make their relationship stronger.</p> <p>He continued to think about her as he brought her home that night. He hoped that he'd still be in college on the weekends and that they would be going out. He knew he would keep that in mind.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>"Oh, I'm so so sorrrl..." T-Bone's voice was choked as he finished his drink. He downed the whiskey in one long gulp. He was feeling good, too, with the alcohol. He looked up to the clock, saw the time, and smiled to himself. No charge. But now he was ready to get to sleep.</p> <p>She looked over to see him staring at the clock. He was still staring at the time. With her, he had been staring at his life—and this time was the time to enjoy her, or maybe, to leave. With her, he had been watching her, and it looked like she was enjoying him watching her!</p> <p>Then he noticed her staring at the clock, too. He was about thirty. He had to fight not to stare at her. The only thing on his mind was not to get his cock in her pants. Instead, he went to get up and go to the restroom.</p> <p>Travis didn't bother to knock. He had not expected her back there. He wondered if she would be there long before she saw the clock. The bathroom door swung open just wide enough to allow him to walk in. He turned to see her standing in the door, looking at it.</p> <p>"I'm sorry if I'm late, but I have to be at work in the morning." he told her.</p> <p>She smiled. "It's okay. I'm at work anyway. Why don't you just come back?" she added with a smile.</p> <p>She pulled him into the bathroom and closed the door.</p> <p>"I'm glad you're here," she said. "I'm not sure how I'm going to react if I get home later in the evening." Her voice was soft and kind.</p> <p>He felt as if he would burst out laughing. "Well, when I get home," he replied as he started to get out of her bathroom, "I would imagine that I could go through with the same thing you asked of me. I've never been more scared than at the prospect of the future."</p> <p>"Well, thank you for the offer," she told him as she got out of the shower and climbed into bed. "I am glad you decided to come, too."</p> <p>Travis fell asleep with her in his arms.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>"I'm back, man," she told the man sitting in his office chair. He looked up at her. He looked as if he were about to ask for an explanation, and she knew what that meant.</p> <p>"So you got lucky," he chuckled. "Got lucky that time between our classes."</p> <p>She started to walk into the room—slowly. "Well, I need to tell you, I was in a school classroom when I took my class. One day I decided I liked it better with a girl, or even, just a girl."</p> <p>The man gave a smirk. "Well, you know who's my teacher now."</p> <p>She walked up behind him, and placed her hands on his upper arms. "Mr. and Mrs. Kowalski," she whispered as she leaned in to give him a kiss on the cheek.</p> <p>"No. I don't think we should do that with him." She felt him shake his head at him, and she smiled.</p> <p>"You're just as weird as Mr. and Mrs. Kowalski was today," he said in his most serious voice. "Besides, I don't think we should..."</p> <p>"Well, we do have to go to your office," she said, cutting the man off. "But, why don't we get up to my office? It's empty."</p> <p>"Oh." He was relieved. This situation had happened before.</p> <p>Travis got up and followed her.</p> <p>"Mr. O'Hara, why aren't you at his office?"</p> <p>"That's where I'm supposed, Mr. O'Hara. How can I do that?"</p> <p>He shook her hand. "I'm sorry. It's alright. But I think you're trying to make the best of it, so I don't blame you if you get caught. Besides, you might want to sit down."</p> <p>Travis didn't know what to say until she moved her face a little closer, so she was almost next to Mr. O'H—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
