I said.</p> <p>"Hah! This is something that we all just can't do - in here!" he laughed.</p> <p>He grabbed the sides of my dress like reins, spun me around and sat in the tub, his body and mine on top of mine.</p> <p>"Are you gonna put on that black, lacey bra that you got?" he smiled, "it'll help hide your tits but you sure as hell won't have to worry about anyone taking the time to put a lot of effort into it!"</p> <p>I was breathing hard by then as my nipples started to harden and get harder.</p> <p>"Hmmmm yeah!" I groaned, I turned over and put my right hand over his right one and squeezed him lightly.</p> <p>He groaned and kissed me firmly as we both leaned in and started to kiss. He kissed me all the way up my face to my neck just as I opened my mouth to protest. He kept holding my waist and slowly stroked my hair and I got the impression that he was working towards seducing me. I got a little bit of a thrill as he kept kissing my neck as he slid a hand up under my bra and caressed my breasts. I started to say 'please' when he pulled me back and started to kiss me again. This time the head of his cock was under the water and I got a thrill from it. I felt it start to grow against my leg as he slid his hand under my skirt while he kissed me.</p> <p>He quickly lifted me, my skirt was still just barely above the water level, and sat me down in the tub. His mouth was on me again and he had a wicked grin on his face as he started to grind his hips, rubbing my clit. He had pulled my blouse open wide to show me my large, lacy black bra and suddenly I felt something brush his thigh.</p> <p>"Mmmmmmm, that's nice!" he whispered.</p> <p>He moved behind me and I felt him slip his hand under my bra strap and slip one hand under to touch my tits. I had closed my eyes for a second as he played, his arm under my tits to cup them, his thumb on my hardening nipples. I groaned and my pussy started to quiver as he slipped two fingers inside me.</p> <p>"Aaah!" I moaned, "don't stop!"</p> <p>"Your tits are so soft!" he said as he moved his fingers around inside me and started to pump the palm of his other hand against my clit. I shuddered from the touch and I could feel all my juices flowing down his fingers as he worked me over.</p> <p>"Come on! Fuck me, you bastards!" I begged, "Fuck me!"</p> <p>"I don't want anything from you!" he smiled.</p> <p>"I want you inside me!" I said as I pulled the water off his dick, "Fuck me!" I repeated.</p> <p>He pulled me onto my knees in the tub as I felt him spread me open and thrust himself inside me, he moved one hand to grab my blonde hair as he rammed himself into me and I could feel his hand grabbing my breast as he kept doing me. It was a strange sensation of his hands on my ass and his large cock, but it was turning me on more and more as I thought about how it would feel to have his weight on me - his weight - my weight on me. It felt fantastic as he took me while taking his time, his hand gripping my hair and pulling me back onto him. It felt as much as anything else as he pumped inside me and I was getting lost in the moment of it.</p> <p>"Jesus, that feels good!" I moaned as I came, it was like nothing I had ever experienced before. He grunted as he came and I felt it pulsing inside me, I could feel its warm release filling me and I could actually feel his big cock pulsing against my clit.</p> <p>It was a new experience for me too - being able to give a guy a blowjob at the same time as someone else. He held my head and started to fuck me like a fucking machine as I just laid there on the hot, wet floor of the tub, unable to move - in fact, my legs seemed to be shaking. He pulled out and turned me to face him.</p> <p>"Kiss me while I fuck you," he said as he kissed me.</p> <p>"No!" I gasped, "Kiss me!" I begged.</p> <p>"No?" he laughed, "you've got to admit it's not that easy!"</p> <p>"I don't want to kiss him!" I protested.</p> <p>"Good!" he said, a wicked smile on his face, "just hold on."</p> <p>I grabbed him by his shirt collar and pulled him closer to meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
