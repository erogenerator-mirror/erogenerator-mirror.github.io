Over. I was not finished, either. I got a little more comfortable with the position I was in, and was getting a little more aroused as my own excitement built, especially when I saw that her skirt had ridden up her legs some more than it had.</p> <p>I wanted to tease her, no, I wanted to drive her crazy. I wasn't going to pass up a blowjob in which we both wanted more.</p> <p>And that's exactly what happened. A little more stroking, and another lick, I moved down to her pussy, and moved my lips to capture her lips in my teeth, and started to suck it, my tongue flicking her clit as I did. This was a new position for me, but I guess I figured I could keep it up for a little longer. The girl had been very wet when she came, and I was happy to be giving her all the pleasure I could.</p> <p>She was squirming, hips in time with my mouth and tongue, hips moving to get more into the experience while her legs had an iron grip on my shoulders. But, there wasn't much more than the wetness. Her breath was heavy, and I had to give her a break from the action on her clit for just a moment to enjoy the feel of my lips on her.</p> <p>Then I felt her hands pull my head up and she said, "Fuck me with that thing you little shit. Fuck your little slut!"</p> <p>I was surprised that my cock was already hard, and getting really wet. I had gotten myself into the role. We had never done much roleplay before, but I guess I really didn't know what to expect. I was surprised to find that she was begging me.</p> <p>"Do it, you little cunt. Fuck my cock. Make me feel good."</p> <p>She was so wet and her words were slurred as I pushed my cock head into her. I had never done so for myself before in real life. But this was different. It was exciting, and it drove me crazy. I didn't know where this would end up, but I didn't really care anymore. My mouth, lips and tongue were doing all kinds of magic. I knew what to do.</p> <p>My mouth and tongue worked all over her while my dick worked her. Her hips were pumping up and down on my mouth, and she was moaning, and crying, and moving her body with every thrust and every withdrawal. I kept sucking and licking her pussy lips, trying to keep her on the brink for several minutes. At one point, as I was licking her clit, she moved her legs up and pushed my shoulders down. She started to fuck my face, and I was still looking up at her pussy when I felt her legs go to my ears. I was surprised to hear her say, "Fuck me, fuck me," so softly.</p> <p>I thought maybe she didn't mean it, but when she said that, she had made no other response to it. I felt her whole body move on top of me, her hot wet pussy all over my mouth, my beard, my cock. Her legs were in the way, so I was able to get my hands on each of her ass cheeks. I had a hand on each side of her little cunt, and it was so soft and yielding that I was surprised at the way her hips were shaking and moving, when I felt that first wave, she was moving me against my mouth. Her whole body was moving against me, and I had to do something to hold onto her.</p> <p>Finally, I couldn't hold on anymore. With a shudder, I started to cum. But when that happened, she took her lips off of my face, turned her head to look at me, and said to me with little tears in her eyes, "You're so good... you're my man, my husband. I want it every day. I don't want this to stop. Keep doing that, if you'll let me."</p> <p>She was smiling now. "I don't want this to stop either. Keep going."</p> <p>I had to, so she leaned forward and kissed me again. This time, I let her. She was still on top of me, still moving on me from time to time, which was nice. My last thing that morning, she asked me about that, and I realized it sounded like we were being sweet and caring. We both got very serious.</p> <p>She was crying out that it was over. I was so happy to be right there with her, feeling her pleasure, feeling her power over me, feeling the way she was making me feel, and loving it. I had loved it, but it had been almost too good to ever get back.</p> <p>She gave me a little smile and said, "No, please..."
