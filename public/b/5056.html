She turned and gave him a big smile and wiggled her butt at him giving a little wiggle. He walked over to her, gave her breast a big squeeze, and looked at her lips in surprise. "Oh, my. I thought you did too."</p> <p>Caitlyn ran her hands over his shoulders, down his arms and gave a smile. "The last time you were here, I did one of the most amazing, beautiful, loving massages." As the last sentence finished, she said, "Why don't you show me how good you can be. I know you like that."</p> <p>A wicked smile crossed his lips as he stood in front of her. Reaching out, he took her hand in his and raised it to her mouth. "I can guarantee you that I can get into most any number of different things that I want to be, but you will have to give me some lessons and let me do them, since you know I would never do what you were after." The tip of his nose moved up on her fingers to lightly tickle her upper lip. She leaned closer then, pressing her lips to his cheek. She ran her tongue lightly along the top of his cheek and then moved to his lips, where she pressed hers lightly together for a couple seconds. "Mmmmm. Mmmmm," she sighed at him. She pressed her lips back to his and closed her mouth. They kissed for a long minute, his tongue finding hers, touching and exploring in a fashion she had never experienced. She felt his hands slide up her sides to rest on her breasts. They were soft yet firm and he caressed her breasts in both hands. They felt like silk to his hands as he squeezed them gently and then he began to move from one to the other. She opened the robe she was wearing open and he leaned in to kiss her.</p> <p>"Are you ready for me?" he asked as he moved back from their kiss.</p> <p>Caitlyn pulled away quickly. "Honey, what kind of a boy would I be if I didn't know that you would give me lessons and let me come here to massage and maybe some other things? How old are you, anyway?"</p> <p>"I just turned 18 last month when I got home. I'm 21 now." He leaned closer as her hands moved down her body rubbing his hardening body. "I have all I need now, and you'll know what else to do with it." She smiled knowing it would only last a very few minutes, but she looked into his eyes as she leaned in and kissed him. His hands found small softness in her arms as his fingers caressed her small breasts. He knew she wanted to teach him how to give great massages, knowing he was the first guy to give her any body parts and yet he was the only virgin boy she wanted to teach.</p> <p>"Well, we wouldn't want to be outdone and you're a virgin. You don't have to be, but you sure as hell wouldn't be until I'm a boy or you're ready to start." He pulled his head back, breaking her kiss, and said, "I'd be honored to have the same chance as you do." She stepped back just as he said it, looking him over in amazement. His hair was a mop as it always was, but with just a few stray hairs in place, he was the same color as a newborn. His eyes were the same same shade of brown as his body, and her eyes moved from his chest to his face. He had a square jaw. She thought it looked like it might be a little bigger than she remembered. His cheeks were a shade darker, and had a little pink in those areas. His lips were very thin and he stood about 6'1", with light brown hair. She was amazed; he was so beautiful. He looked over at her, her eyes following his body, following it with every move she made. He just shook his head. He was still wearing his shirt with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows. "Well," she said looking him over. "I guess you know the drill," she said softly reaching up and turning his head back to her. When he didn't move, she moved closer so she could take him face to face. "And I guess I get what you mean about being ready to learn now. After all, I'm a boy." He looked in her eyes, seeing her eyes, then his, locked on to hers. He felt his own body tremble in her arms, but didn't have one of those quick, quick peeks that guys do. His lips closed onto hers slowly as he slipped an arm under her arm, bringing it away from her bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
