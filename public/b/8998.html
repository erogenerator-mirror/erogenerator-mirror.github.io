It will have me going for about forty years and then I will look my life over with my family, your parents and me. You'll get to see, love, that I was a very lucky guy. But, that's not all, my love - it will be more."</p> <p>That last phrase, which I loved very much, was one of her many, if not the single most, in her speech. And, she told me, if I were willing, I might get to see the photos. She said that we had some photos we wanted to take.</p> <p>We drove to a remote island I could take to the next island on the next trip.</p> <p>At a point I thought to ask about our trip. "What's the name of it?" I asked her.</p> <p>"It's called Island of Love and Love is where everyone, men, women, and children is coming and going. It's called Loveland." She grinned. "It is a wonderful adventure. It was my love, when I was young, which is when I became my daughter. I grew up in Paradise Cove and I loved it and I still like that island. It was my loving, for sure, as a young girl, but I wasn't a young girl. I had my choice. I chose to go for it. It was my choice to go for that. Then, I had my choice to go for a holiday. My parents went for something else, to see the sun. And, it was our decision to go for a holiday." She was thoughtful.</p> <p>A short while later, a small boat pulled up. Three people jumped out and went to it, all of them topless. In a way that I didn't like, I got a little upset. This time, when my father-in-law waved to us, he waved back. For some reason I felt an obligation to him. It was a long time back when he was as close to me as he was now. Now, he was my father-in-law.</p> <p>"I love you," he said. "We are going to Paradise Cove."</p> <p>"Thank you, father. I love you, too."</p> <p>"I need to get some work done. I want to get something to eat and maybe we can catch some sun. I feel like a lot of people back home are going to eat and have sunburned body. I'll be back in a few hours, to tell me what's going on. And, I want all my children to have a vacation of their own." His look of disappointment made me feel better. He had only been gone as long as I'd known him, maybe for a long, long time.</p> <p>"Dad, can I ask you something?"</p> <p>"Sure, honey. Anything."</p> <p>"Is there anything in particular I can do for you?"</p> <p>"Absolutely. What do you like to do?"</p> <p>"I like my body," she said, as she spread her legs wide. "I like to be the woman in charge."</p> <p>"Is that what you do in Paradise Cove?" He said in amazementâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
