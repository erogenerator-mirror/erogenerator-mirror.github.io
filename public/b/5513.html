"But I don't want a boyfriend anymore."</p> <p>"You didn't have one," Tina interrupted my speech. She took a sip of orange juice.</p> <p>"There's just so much at stake. I know I've got it bad," I said.</p> <p>"That's not true. We got a lot to look forward to, and I don't think it should continue until we're both out of college. There are lots of things I want to get done for another couple of years before settling down again," Tina said.</p> <p>We sat there listening to each other talking. All I could think about was what we could do to help each other out.</p> <p>"You know," Tina said. "If we could make it, I would really like to get back together with you."</p> <p>"Really? You are a sexier guy than I am. Are you kidding? Of course," I said. "We've been together forever, aren't we?"</p> <p>"Are you suggesting we try something sexual?" Tina asked. I nodded my agreement.</p> <p>"That's the first time someone is going to tell me that I'm a better lover than I am," I said. Tina looked shocked for only a couple of seconds, then smiled.</p> <p>"I didn't mean to say that," she said. "I think we're both happy."</p> <p>"Are your guys going to be pissed?" I asked.</p> <p>"My guys don't want that to go away any time soon. They're tired and stressed."</p> <p>"What do you mean?" I asked.</p> <p>"There's always a part of me that likes being with you. It's not just that you're good and kind to look after me. No, it's just that you're not a man that likes to date my girl. It turns me on to think about her, especially during sex."</p> <p>"That's what you guys talk about all the time. They're not interested in me anymore, just that we're not the typical guys that date the girl. I've found out that I still don't mind being with a girl whenever anyone wants to have an intimate relationship with her. So I guess we have some more work to do."</p> <p>"I'm not going to sleep with someone I'm attracted to every day," she said.</p> <p>"What are you saying?"</p> <p>"It's just sex, you know?"</p> <p>"And to see the guy you really care about with you hanging around with your boyfriend when you need someone?" I said.</p> <p>"We both know you guys are pretty and sexy. That's all I meant," she said. I nodded my agreement then smiled and smiled back.</p> <p>"Have you ever thought about me naked?" Tina asked. I hesitated for a minute, then nodded. "Well that's okay," she said. "Let's get naked."</p> <p>As soon as Tina was naked she climbed on the bed. I got out of my clothes in a second. Then we were kissing again. Tina held my manhood and rolled me on top of her. She spread her legs and said, "Do it." I positioned the head of my cock at the entrance of her pussy. She was wet, as I entered her a little ways. The feeling of her wet pussy wrapping around my cock and sliding down it was like nothing else before.</p> <p>To Tina, getting her pussy wrapped around my cock was like getting it to the end of her cock. It felt so good to feel the pressure of my cock. I kept fucking her.</p> <p>"I think I'm about to cum."</p> <p>"I don't mind that either," I told her. With my cock in her pussy I felt the end and she felt the rest.</p> <p>"I want you in me some more," she said as soon as she'd spoken. She was panting and breathing hard. I felt my orgasm rushing toward me. My cock was still inside her. My orgasm was approaching, but I needed a little more to make me cum.</p> <p>"Are you sure you're okay with that?" I asked.</p> <p>"I told you once before we were dating that I'd never want to cheat on my boyfriend," she said.</p> <p>"You have to be kidding!" I exclaimed. "This is it. I've got to do this. If we get a divorce, or even if I don't get a divorce, I'll still love you. We're both married to your boyfriend."</p> <p>"That's a good point," she said. "I don't want to have to hide from him. I'd still have to trust him. I'm not going to have to hide. If anything happens between us, it will be with someone else, not me." Then she smiled and nodded.
