She asked, feeling so foolish by how far I'd come. She really didn't know what to think.</p> <p>"I just know." I answered. "That's what you want?" Her eyes widened, and her voice went high-pitched.</p> <p>"That's what I wanted. That's exactly what I hoped you'd want." I answered her. "And it's what I hoped you'd want. And I'm not complaining. You can have me anytime you like."</p> <p>She hesitated a moment. "Okay. You said that you like to be a top, but the other thing you've always wanted, I suppose, is you want to have two men at once."</p> <p>"No," I answered quietly. "What makes you think I love two men at once is because there's really no other explanation that comes along. And if I'm not careful, I'd never be able to keep both of you."</p> <p>"So do you just accept that you want to be the best husband for your new husband?" She asked.</p> <p>"If that's what you want, I'll do it! And if it is not, then don't even think about it! I don't care! There is no other explanation for wanting two men at the same time. I have to accept that you'll have two men at once so I can't object!"</p> <p>"No, I wouldn't accept that." She said flatly. "I mean it. I can't accept that. I want it now, so don't even think of refusing me! And if that's what you want, then you won't be the one to complain."</p> <p>"Alright," I answered, trying to think of what to do.</p> <p>We drove the rest of the way home and went to bed, spooning, just trying to be as calm as we possibly could be. It would be much easier for all of us, right now. But I was still worried about not bringing up our past weekend adventure, and how she'd react to it after she recovered from being upset with me.</p> <p>*********</p> <p>After we got home and she went in to the restroom and freshened up, I went down to the kitchen to make a sandwich. She came in a few minutes later, and came out of the door and came around to sit on the couch beside me. I gave her a playful nudge.</p> <p>"Can we talk about that," I said, and we sat silently for a while and I saw her cheeks flush bright red when she realized what I'd said. She smiled in relief and got up and went back over to her chair and sat back down, while I was getting her a piece of sandwich to eat.</p> <p>"So, you were saying that you wanted more than two men?" She asked me.</p> <p>"Yeah, right." I answered, "but it won't be that. It's just a fantasy that I've had for a while now. That's why I agreed to have you with me." I paused to take another bite of my sandwich. "So, I just want to be your husband, and you'll do whatever I want! I just want to be there with you, and be there."</p> <p>She didn't need to answer or ask that. I knew that I was making her my partner - or my submissive - and I didn't expect her to be happy about it. But I still wasn't happy with the idea, and if we did this before, I did want to continue our adventure. It was worth it though.</p> <p>"So you want to try two men at once?" She asked me, looking up at me with an inquiring expression.</p> <p>"And if I'm the right man for my new man?" I answered.</p> <p>"Yes?" She said, smiling down between my legs, and looking at my penis. I watched her as she slowly took it into her hands and started stroking it up and down.</p> <p>"I really don't know..." I said, trying to get out the words. "...I wouldn't want to get to hurt you."</p> <p>"I know, Baby, I know you would want us to try it, so don't feel bad about not wanting it. But to do it, you've gotta have some sort of a chance." She continued stroking it until I was fully erect. "I just want you to know that there are certain things that you don't want to do."</p> <p>"What sort of things?" I asked. "Everything. The way I see it," I paused and looked at her, "you have to find out when you're ready. But it has to be tonight. Tonight you can find out if you really want to experience two men at the same time. Because I'm sure you're a pretty good judge of other women's needs. So, after tonight, if you have toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
