My jaw dropped open. She took half a step towards me, stopped, and again pressed her body against mine. I felt my own body start to quake as she slid the panties off one of her legs and held them in front of my face. "Kiss it," she ordered and I obliged. She lifted my hair-dress off of my head and kissed the back of my neck. I was in a state of bliss as she reached down between us and pulled her panties down and then off. "Do you know what that feels like? It's so, so wrong," she said and her fingers, now wet, wrapped together under mine as she pressed her naked body against mine, "so forbidden," and she kissed me deeply as she lifted my dress in the middle of the room.</p> <p>When she had me completely naked she stood there with her hands on her hips, she put her hands to her waist. "Now, come here." She pulled my chin towards her and tilted my face up to kiss me. I opened my mouth and extended my tongue out to her. "Ah, that's better," she laughed, "do me like that."</p> <p>With our mouths open I began to caress her breasts with my lips and tongue. Her hand moved down to her pussy and she stroked herself with one of her fingers. I reached between her legs to feel her, to try and feel the wetness I'd seen between her legs since my shower. She pulled me down to the floor where I sat on my ass and she began to finger herself. "Oh, there, there, yes, oh, God, you're going to love this, you know?" She giggled and slid two more fingers into me. "Oh, you're going to be good."</p> <p>She turned my face up to her and kissed me again. "Let's get out of here," she murmured.</p> <p>She grabbed me by the hand and led me, still naked, to the hallway outside the bathroom. We hurried, stumbling, stumbling, as we hurried into the other bathroom.</p> <p>It was quite dark as we entered the bathroom. The door was closed and we came together as she pushed me into the back of the doorway. "What's this?" she whispered into my ear. "Is this what you want? Is this what you need?"</p> <p>In response I kissed her and caressed her breasts from behind her. She pushed me up against the wall and pulled me into her. Our lips met and our hands roamed, exploring each other. She moved down until we were eye to eye again. Her lips were on the softness of my neck. I had no idea what she said to do, she was so sensual, so alive, so erotic.</p> <p>She dropped to her knees and continued downward, pausing to kiss her way down to my crotch. She stroked the soft lips and moved her tongue up the shaft of my cock. I'm not sure exactly what she wanted, but I figured it must have been in her mouth.</p> <p>She took me in her mouth and, without even thinking, plunged herself down on me. She was determined, I could tell. She had my whole cock in her mouth while I caressed her breasts from behind.</p> <p>I reached down and reached around her to caress her breasts in my hands and squeeze her nipples gently. She was a wonderful cocksucker. It felt so good. I've never been so excited in my life as I was as she sucked me and caressed my balls. When I came I had a wild thought and I pulled her off of me and got down on my knees.</p> <p>I took her by the hand and led her back into the bedroom. I laid her on the bed on her back and knelt between her legs, my face just inches from her pussy as I lifted her skirt and saw that lovely, soft bottom. I lowered my head and kissed and nibbled on her inner thighs. She lifted her legs and pulled them up toward her chest. When I kissed between her legs, she pulled herself against my nose and mouth and I knew I would be enjoying this, I knew it, I knew it, I heard it, I tasted it all, I knew it, I just knew she would be so sexy.</p> <p>When my tongue made contact with her pussy I had a sudden hard on. She hadn't even given me permission to touch her. I'd been so horny from watching her and now I wanted her for my own, just for my own pleasure.
