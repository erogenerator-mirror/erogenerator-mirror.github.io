Once out of sight of the house she turned right at the end of the street, then pulled right over. She looked around the car as she drove along, hoping that her husband would come in and see what she was doing.</p> <p>He couldn't find them, so she turned into the driveway. She got out and walked around the car again, but this time she turned and walked past the front door. They came to a halt at the door and saw the light go on from the kitchen. He reached over and took it from her hand, but she just stood there waiting for his answer. He stepped out and joined her in the kitchen.</p> <p>"Hi, honey," she said as he walked in, "what are we doing?"</p> <p>"Sit on the sofa," was his reply. He moved to his own sofa, and sat down next to his wife, taking all the time in the conversation between them to tell her the good news.</p> <p>As the conversation continued he continued to sit there until he was nearly asleep. Soon he was again asleep and they decided to go to bed. They both got up, went to the guest room, turned on the light and closed the door. He sat on the bed and she lay on the bed. After a few minutes they heard his breathing getting harder. He got up to go shower and they lay on the bed together as they finished their night.</p> <p>Saying that it was wonderful feeling him in her again, she said that it wasn't to happen again, and told him that there might not be anything left for him. It just felt so good and there was no need for any further questions.</p> <p>Afterwards they got dressed, went downstairs to eat breakfast and continue to talk about the day. After their breakfast they put on some more clothes and went into the front room, got a few bottles of wine, found their way to the garage and got in the Lexus.</p> <p>He was in the driver's seat and she was sitting cross-legged in front of him. He leaned in closer and asked, "Do you think you could show me how much of that stuff you just bought was worth doing another shopping trip with your husband?"</p> <p>"As in, you're going to just do it naked for a change, are you going to do the same for me?"</p> <p>He was silent for quite some time before he spoke up again. "Sure."</p> <p>"Well, I'm not exactly sure, but it would be a lot longer than just a quick flash across the street before you drove off on that drive, would it not?"</p> <p>"You would have to get naked too, just the way you're doing right now, honey."</p> <p>"Sure, I guess. I'll need to bring a blouse and bra."</p> <p>She started to undress for him, but stopped and just shook her head, leaving him standing in the garage with his arms at his sides. She took a good look at his body.</p> <p>"Is that what you are trying to come up with, Honey? A plan?" she asked.</p> <p>"What plan? I'm not completely naked for all you think."</p> <p>"Oh, that's not my point! I mean, I know you're only a little shy, but this is just a small step! Now take off your clothes."</p> <p>"But you'll have to help me!" he said.</p> <p>She gave him a shove and he fell out of the car about five feet from her. He grabbed at the buttons of her shirt, but had nowhere to go. His hands were already shaking in frustration and he could tell she was shaking. He couldn't tell if he was trying to get her to take the shirt off or not, but at least it seemed like she was reluctant to leave that to him anyway. He reached out toward her, grabbed the top button on her shirt and looked up into her eyes.</p> <p>She sat up slightly and lifted her arms toward him and they met at his chest. He reached out and lightly brushed his fingers over the side of her face and down her neck. She leaned her head back onto his chest and looked up at him. She didn't seem to make any move at all about moving, but when she did her eyes were full of passion.</p> <p>"Okay, honey," he said, "just go along with me."</p> <p>"Okay. I mean, I won't go too far, but you're still going to be naked for a while."</p> <p>He reached out and put his hand around her neck and pulled her toward him. He started kissing her neck and then continued down to her collarbone, licking each inch of her skin where his tongue could find it. He pulled her shirt up and she let himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
