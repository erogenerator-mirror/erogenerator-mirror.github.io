He says. "I know you'll love it." He continues to pump my pussy with his right hand. I am squirming around feeling his hand moving into me on the inside. I feel myself starting to shake from the excitement. I really don't like it. I want to make an impression. I want them to believe I am a slut now.</p> <p>I can feel the bed rock. I don't want them to know how I am feeling. I just need more. I know they can't see my shaking because the bed hasn't moved. "Please fuck me! Please fuck my tight pussy!" I scream.</p> <p>"Yes, this whore begs for it. She wants it." He says. He thrusts his hand deep into me and I feel myself being fucked. "You love it when you are my slut." he says. "Fuck me! Fill my whore pussy with your cum. Make me your whore!" and I scream. I start to feel my orgasm starting. I am cumming and I don't want them to know it. The bed is going rock hard. I feel like screaming but there's no one around except my husband.</p> <p>"Oh, Daddy! I love you so much!" I can feel him stiffen inside me. I feel his hot cum hitting the inside of me. I feel it flowing out of me. I feel all his hardness throb in me. I feel like someone has turned the water on. He thrusts harder and harder in me as I feel my orgasm start. I'm cumming and he feels me cumming on him. I feel his cock twitch deep in me a few more times as my orgasm subsides. He's still inside me as I finish cumming but I'm still cumming from him.</p> <p>"Oh, my little slut!" He says in between breathes. "That was so good."</p> <p>I feel myself finally start to relax and he withdraws. He lies down on me and hugs me to him. "Wow. That was fabulous!" I say.</p> <p>I'm thinking about what came over me and what I want in return for it. I'm not sure where it all got started. I think I finally agreed with my husband. I know that when it was over he had no intention of ever having sex again. "I hope. I still love you." I whisper.</p> <p>"Don't I get a say?" His lips brush my ear. I hear my husband laughing.</p> <p>"What about your panties? I'll be there with my cock in them for the rest of the afternoonâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
