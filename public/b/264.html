She smiled at him.</p> <p>"I'm feeling very comfortable." He felt her hand move to the front of his shorts and then up his leg to where she could feel him. "We, well," he started to say.</p> <p>"Let me." She whispered to him again.</p> <p>"I'm feeling very..." He paused as she touched him.</p> <p>"We have to be quiet." She whispered again. "I can't make out."</p> <p>He started to say something and then sighed. "I'm sorry." He whispered as she pulled her hands away and sat up to look at him again.</p> <p>"I feel really bad." She smiled at him again. "I don't want to make it worse." She said as she reached over to pull up the covers on her bed. "Let's just try sleep for now." She pulled it aside and he laid down. It was the worst mistake he'd ever made of thinking he could sleep anywhere himself. He could hear her in the darkness of her room but he could feel the covers on top of his head. She laid beside him and put her head on his shoulder.</p> <p>He wasn't sure if she could hear his heart racing in his ears. She was probably sound asleep but he thought he heard her breath. He turned his head and looked up at her beautiful face. "I can't tell if you want me to come here. I can't just lie here, you have to go back to sleep," he said softly. "If we're going to be alone we're going to have to wake up first. Do you think I could just wake you up later?"</p> <p>"Nope, you can't. We've been together too long. And we have a lot of things to work out." Her face turned to look at him and she started to smile. "You're my best friend and you have this huge house that I have to show you." Her smile went the rest of the way to be in that smile with her eyes. She got up from her bed and stood over him. "Come to sleep, baby."</p> <p>He tried to sleep as it was going on for hours. He felt like her boyfriend wasn't even in the room at this point and he was thinking that he knew that if he was out of touch he would die. He really didn't care that there was anyone else out there at this moment even if he was in his best friend's room. He didn't feel like that about Katie like she was, but he felt something about her like she wouldn't let him go any further. He really thought she was right for all that he had done, but he also knew that no one had ever really made him feel like he did. He felt so safe with her, to her, and to where she belonged, because he had never let anyone down in his life. He was the first and only reason she was able to take him outside of her room and not back into hers. He could feel the tears start to fall from between her eyes as he stared into hers. "I have to say that I wish you were here," he whispered as he buried his face in the crook of her neck.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I can't sleep." She whispered as she placed her hand on his neck.</p> <p>"Me too." He whispered back. He couldn't even think about it.</p> <p>"I can feel it. I know it is wrong how I feel... but I have to say I really am sorry." She said softly as she ran her fingers lightly against his hair. She reached for him and pulled him closer as they drifted off to sleep.</p> <p>Katys eyes closed as she drifted in and out, not really thinking. Her hand slowly stroked up and down his side as she felt him start to wake up. He looked over at her as she stroked him and kissed his cheek. He started to move his hips but stopped as she slowly stroked him from bottom to top.</p> <p>"Let me." She whispered back, so quietly it could have barely registered.</p> <p>He heard her moving off the bed and then the sound of him being thrown on out of the way. He looked over at her as she lay there on his back and smiled at him.</p> <p>"Let me." He whispered back as he slipped his hand under her shirt and over her stomach. The feel of her soft skin on his hand was like a warm blanket. In fact he was surprised and slightly scared for a moment, but he couldn't move on it any farther as he quickly removed her shorts and underwear with his fingers. She was as naked as him and his eyes were drawn back to her beautiful body as he felt his hard cock start to harden.</p> <p>He slowly stroked her as she moaned softly. "Let me make you feel better." His hands felt as soft as silk asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
