Don't question me. Just do whatever feels good for you."</p> <p>It was true, but he didn't need to. He loved her, in a way she could never, that love had been replaced by something else and had to end for him.</p> <p>"It's what you'll get from all of this," he said as he picked up his phone and dialled a number.</p> <p>"Mike, it's me," he managed to say before hanging up.</p> <p>"I know! You bastard!" Beth gurgled in fury.</p> <p>"Sorry darling, you must be mad. It's only a phone call but you couldn't answer it when it rang."</p> <p>"It's ok! I just wanted to make sure," she said as she put her phone away. "I really need to go," she added as she stood up and moved away from the table. She didn't want the call in the middle of his office.</p> <p>She looked down at her backside once more. The sight of her curvy bottom swaying from side to side told him that she was in desperate need of some stimulation. God! She was going to get into all of this again.</p> <p>As she approached the doorway to the hall, she could see her way was blocked. With a last look, she locked the door, then turned and walked back again. She had almost run into her boss. She didn't need to use the key to get her way out of the door, she needed to have her way with some of the men.</p> <p>Beth moved quickly and hurriedly through to John's office. He was talking directly to Dave.</p> <p>"John, I'm meeting Beth in the office."</p> <p>"Ok, can you make it to my office without knocking? I'm going to ring the bell and we'll have coffee for a change and talk."</p> <p>Beth was about to say something in return when Dave interrupted.</p> <p>"Beth, don't get so upset," he said as he held the door open for her. "This is my boss Mike, Dave's boss. Mike, do you want to come with me or wait a while? It's only a few minutes."</p> <p>Beth was about to reply but stopped herself. No! What would he think of her? The offer from Beth was outrageous but she needed to play along. How could she say no!</p> <p>"No, please don't be ridiculous. It will be a quickie, don't worry about it."</p> <p>Tentatively, she stepped away from him, letting him open the door before stepping into his hallway.</p> <p>"Yes, Mike, let me up before I break down again," she said sarcastically. She turned and gave him a hard look. "Please, we've been talking," she added, stepping behind him and closing the door.</p> <p>"You've been talking again, haven't you?" Mike asked as he followed her into the office.</p> <p>"I've been talking all night, so I've had a bit of a run over," she said as she sat back in her little cubicle with her back to him. "Well, I've had a bit of a run because of you," she added.</p> <p>Beth's eyes locked on Mike's which had just opened his coat and she was trying unsuccessfully to make conversation. He'd managed to look at most of her naked body from top to bottom, from neck to ankle.</p> <p>"I've seen you in more than just business attire," he said to her with a grin. "I've seen you naked."</p> <p>Beth's face went from anger to shock. "I wasn't expecting that! But I couldn't seem to ignore you. Not with our little game," she said as she stepped from the cubicle.</p> <p>Mike quickly followed in her wake. "Shit," he whispered, sitting back in his chair as though he'd caught something very unexpected.</p> <p>"No, come stay with me while I go get things ready." Mike said as he stood up.</p> <p>"Oh no, I meant I want a real fucking date!" Beth said as she stood on unsteady legs to follow him to his car.</p> <p>"No you don't," he said as he closed the door. "And no! You can't expect me to walk all the way to our meeting dressed like that. Not when you're going to put on a great show, just like you did with your husband," he added as he kissed her cheek. "I can't have you standing at your job looking like that in just your suit!"</p> <p>"I'm sorry," Beth said, feeling his eyes upon her as she turned to leave.</p> <p>"It's ok darling, I'mâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
