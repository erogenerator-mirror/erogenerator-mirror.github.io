"I want to catch up on what my roommate looks like."</p> <p>"You're the one who should do your own cooking..." offered Matt cheerily, his grin already starting to blossom.</p> <p>"Hey!" said Jocelyn as he pulled down his pants and shirt, "But you know where everything is!"</p> <p>"Alrighty then, I'll come and get her," he lied, "I'll grab a beer and we'll meet over at the bar, ok?"</p> <p>"Oi," they all chorused, "We'll see you later."</p> <p>"Yeah, later."</p> <p>"Ooh yeeesss..." said Jocelyn with a giggle, giving Matt a wink.</p> <p>"Don't worry, we'll be ready in plenty of time, y'know!" she said as she jumped up from her desk and quickly ran into her bedroom, her body still feeling the effects of the alcohol it had consumed tonight.</p> <p>"Good night, boys," came the reply.</p> <p>"Well now, what's the game plan?" asked Jocelyn as she headed to the fridge and started getting herself a beer. She poured herself a beer and looked around her room, checking out each room for clues as to which room she was on. It seemed to her that no one, or mostly not anyone was here. As she scanned all the available rooms, she began to feel a little awkward and wondered why people dressed as sluts. It seemed very strange and not at all how everyone dressed like she did, if the only reason they were wearing the clothes she was wearing, was to get lucky and find a nice guy to take advantage of with a few drinks, right?</p> <p>"Hoooh... oh, here it is!" she heard her roommate say as she walked in to the main room wearing a black spaghetti strapped tank top and an even filco skirt that flared out down to just above her knee. She also wore matching black hold up stockings and high heels.</p> <p>"Hooooo, ohh, hooo, haaaaammmm. That's amazing," moaned a bubbly female voice, "I bet I could make one of you guys jealous."</p> <p>It was her roommate Emily, wearing a cute little camisole that was cut high over her large tits and was just barely hiding her tiny waist. She wore a short pink sleeveless dress that was only just covering the tops of her bare legs and flared out just a bit from her midriff. The entire design was a bit sexy, but not for wearing a top that made her cleavage look too big just to show off those big fake tits. She wore a pair of pink platform sandals that looked as if they were painted on and had five inch heels, which made her long bare legs look even curvier. The hem of the short dress was just below her butt where her butt seemed stuck out, with the hem just barely to mid-thigh. The outfit was cut above that and clung to her like a glove. It made her look both sophisticated and sexy, like this outfit just made her feel sexy and sexy at the same time.</p> <p>"Wow Jocelyn, that's awesome, I can hardly go out to the bar alone tonight."</p> <p>"Yeah, I know. And maybe we'd better wait outside. I don't want to get any of the people here in the car sick!" she declared, "Maybe we should go just in the front parking area."</p> <p>"Yeah, yeah, I don't trust myself on that," Jocelyn said, her face turning deep shade of red. She had hoped that their night out might be a little more exciting, but her roommate thought it was going to be even more shocking in an alcohol-fueled frenzy that night.</p> <p>"Oh no, I want a whole new experience tonight," she added with a smile. "In fact, I was counting on someone to come up here to get more intimate soon!"</p> <p>"Yeah, you're just so fun to tease, and I always feel kind of wicked when it comes to sexy people, especially some of the guys who don't even know them..."</p> <p>Emily's eyes went wide, and she looked a little worried.</p> <p>"Oh, I don't know about that, maybe it's just you guys aren't all that good, that's not for you to take all those guys with you!" Jocelyn said as she took another swig of her beer before walking outside the room and towards the garage where she knew her roommate's car was parked. She quickly opened the garage door and hurried outside, still wearing the pink outfit with her blonde hair done up in pig tails, which were tied with the string around her head in a ponytail. She opened the passenger door while Jocelyn got in andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
