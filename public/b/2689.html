"But I don't have any idea where they are and how to find them."</p> <p>"I don't know anything about that," she answered, leaning over the bed as if looking for something. "I guess I got up early yesterday to do some work that I'd come by myself before anyone came through. I usually slept over there until midnight, or if I had a shift at a truck stop. I was tired when they closed the show."</p> <p>"I bet there was a truck stop to the left," he said, grinning. "I can just see where you got your money from, though."</p> <p>"No way, Tom. I got it for you from..."</p> <p>"That depends what you mean," he told her, looking as if he was going to argue. "The rest of the story. I got you your money when you got the truck. It would have been nice to have had it," he told her, looking at the clock.</p> <p>"You mean, it was you who paid the truck stop?" she asked hopefully. She leaned over the bed again, waiting for an answer, but didn't hear one.</p> <p>"Yep, it was," he told her. "But, if I'm not wrong, so too is it," he said with a laugh. "How long has that been going on?" he asked.</p> <p>"You're making me nervous," she told him in a whisper. "I've been married for twenty six years now and I've never dated, at least not romantically," she replied shyly.</p> <p>"I'll bet you've never had a cock in your ass," he teased her. "Now that you've started to have them, you're already going to have a cock," he informed her. Taking her arm in his, he guided her hand through the night. "There's nothing like a big beautiful cock," he told her. "There are a lot of cocksuckers out there, Tom. Most of them are into a whole lifestyle I guess," he said, laughing, as she squeezed his cock through his pants.</p> <p>"We should check out the rest of the show," he suggested. "That's where I'm taking you," he said, pulling her up the steps to the cab of the truck that he had driven away. "If you'd like to use the room, you and I can make love out here if you choose."</p> <p>"We don't have to be seen fucking in the truck," she said as she climbed into the passenger side of the truck. "I love it when a man pulls me out there and bends me over the passenger seat. Then, he does what he wants with me and I go around to the driver's side of the truck so he can see the show."</p> <p>"You're kidding!" Tom said, holding up his hand to stop her. "Why in heavens name would you do something like that? It makes me so uncomfortable."</p> <p>"That's the thing that I like about most of the men that I've had to look at. Most of them are too big or too young for my little girl pussy," she said with a smile. "I know it's against the rules, but it still gets me hot at the thought of all the cocks I've found to please me that way," she told him, squeezing his cock. "I always get wet just thinking about all the cocks that I've been with for a long time," she said, looking at the ceiling and laughing.</p> <p>"Not at all," Tom assured her. "I want you to know that I don't think that I am a pervert either, nor am I prejudiced. I just think that it makes me very happy to have a woman like you with me. After all, you're only twenty-one years old as I am, isn't that right?" he told her.</p> <p>"Why is that so important to you?" she asked, laughing, as she remembered what a pretty girl she had once was. "I would never make fun of you if you were my age or if I were still in my twenties," she told him. "But, I think that you're doing a pretty good job."</p> <p>"I'm very happy here in my own home with your permission," he answered, grinning. "I want to make love with you. I've wanted you for so long since..." he looked at his watch, "I've always wanted you."</p> <p>"It's okay, Tom. I can go into that office and do some work on my old truck and then come home and have a shower and eat supper," she told him. "I don't really have a lot of time to do anything else with it anyway."</p> <p>"I'm sure that I don't have any timeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
