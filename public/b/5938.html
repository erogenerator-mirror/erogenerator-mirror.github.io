He took a look at the body, and could just make out her large breasts encased in a deep v-neck sweater. The woman was wearing a navy-blue blouse that was open to reveal a deep cleavage between her breasts. Her skirt wasn't short, but it reached midway down her thighs. Her legs were bare except for the stockings that were barely extending her thighs.</p> <p>The man stared at her for a second, and she seemed to like it, the way he leered at her. The woman was about five feet and five pounds heavier than her wife, and her body was slim and curvy. Her tits were still large, but the nipples appeared to be quite large and were very firm. She had a bit of a paunch, which drew attention to her stomach and thighs, but the woman had the same paunch too. She was thin too, but her thighs and stomach were rounded and firm. They all wore the same light-blue sweater, and although it was thin, the woman wore thin blue pants that showed off a pair of firm buttocks and legs.</p> <p>Her dress was almost knee-length and came to the middle of her thighs. The dress flowed down her stomach and hips, and ended at mid-thigh, and the lower half of her leg was bare. Her feet were bare, too, and although her stockings were stockings the nylon was completely transparent. She looked almost as if she was naked, and this was a first.</p> <p>"Are you a woman?" she asked, not quite looking up from her magazine.</p> <p>"Yes, ma'am," the man said. "But I have a little more to add to it. I'm divorced, but the kids do live in New York, and I'm here for a vacation, but I can use the bathroom. My name is Dave. How can I help you?"</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sorry," the woman replied, "I don't really know the man on the other end, but I'm pretty sure we're alone. Where do you live?"</p> <p>"At a cabin in Virginia, on the other side of here." The man handed over his phone, and Dave's eyes followed the line of his fingers which were almost in the woman's view. He was only a couple of inches away, which wasn't unusual, but was the first thing on his mental list to appear at my door.</p> <p>"There's a bathroom between there, too. I can get you a key if you want. I can do some grocery shopping on my way home."</p> <p>"No, thank you," the woman said, "This is kind of nice. I don't usually do much for my friends, but it's been a while since I've been out of the house." She turned her attention to the man. "So, where do you live?"</p> <p>"In Virginia. I'm married, and I'm single. The only reason I'm out of the door is sometimes, as often as I can."</p> <p>"Is there any chance of getting me in a room with you, or do you have a friend to keep an eye on you?"</p> <p>"Well, I'm married too, I'm a senior on the engineering degree, and it doesn't take long to get a room."</p> <p>The woman turned and looked him over. The first thing she noticed were his glasses. She tried to concentrate on his eyes but felt herself begin to lose herself in them. He seemed to be a bit flustered, as if he were thinking about something important, and all the woman could do was look.</p> <p>"My name's Samantha. I'm a freshman in college at the University of Virginia, and I love my job." He was still smiling, but his eyes were now glued to her face.</p> <p>"Thanks, Samantha." Samantha was the woman's roommate. "My mom told me about your divorce, and she's been doing a lot of talking and putting up with a lot of the bullshit that goes with it."</p> <p>"What's wrong with her? I mean, the divorce started about a year ago." "Don't worry about it," Samantha said. "There's not much about it that I don't know, and you can just bet I've had a lot of practice doing that to guys."</p> <p>"That really is too much. I thought you were more serious about your family."</p> <p>"Well, I am. I just don't know exactly what my parents might have done if I divorced Dad. I don't have any children, and Dad isn't the dad they were expecting."</p> <p>"I guess Mom didn't expect you to be married, and if Dad had done a poor job of it, they probably wouldnâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
