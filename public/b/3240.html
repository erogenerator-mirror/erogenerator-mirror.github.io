"Have we been married long?" I asked.</p> <p>"Fourteen years."</p> <p>"That's a long time."</p> <p>"Too long."</p> <p>She gave me one of her deep smiles. "I'll make that decision for myself."</p> <p>"So, what do you need to have for Valentine?"</p> <p>"It's a date."</p> <p>"It's Valentine's Day? I thought it was Christmas, Valentine's Day."</p> <p>"It is. Do you know how sad it is not that it's just us? No, don't ask. That would be ridiculous, especially with me married and two girls in our lives."</p> <p>"Well, I don't know and, no, not with you, you're just a lovely little thing. It doesn't mean anything."</p> <p>"So, do you get the idea?"</p> <p>"I have to say no."</p> <p>"I know."</p> <p>"No, you don't," I said.</p> <p>"I'm serious. So, will I go to a movie?"</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"A theater where you're the only entertainment?"</p> <p>"No, no theater. I'd be bored."</p> <p>"So, you can go to a theater and spend Valentine's Day with your little sister?"</p> <p>"I'm serious," she said.</p> <p>"I'm going to have to ask you one more time."</p> <p>"That's all you need to do that."</p> <p>I stood up. "No, that's just too far. If you want to come over sometime in the future, I'd probably think you had another date of your own. Or you wouldn't have met me."</p> <p>"I don't want to be with a man like that. Not for some time yet."</p> <p>"Oh, don't worry, you don't."</p> <p>I walked out of the kitchen into the livingroom. Ellen took a deep breath, she looked at the sofa, then turned back toward me, and said, "I have to say, this is nice."</p> <p>"It's not a date," I told her.</p> <p>"That's not true either. We didn't go out, you didn't go out and you didn't go to movies with me."</p> <p>"Well, I didn't date anyone in particular either."</p> <p>She grinned, "I didn't know it would be such a big deal. It just happened."</p> <p>I laughed. "It was just too good to be true," I told her, "but you can change that one."</p> <p>"Thanks," she said and I saw her look at our date on the sofa.</p> <p>I got a hard on by the minute, thinking about what Ellen did to me that night and I made a mental note to watch TV on Saturday and do a similar.</p> <p>The day went by very slow for me. I had only had a couple of beers. Ellen and I had been going out for about a week and I was not looking forward to it.</p> <p>I tried to go out at Christmas, but, well, it was just too busy. She wanted to go shopping with her friends. She wanted me to buy something new for Valentine's Day, but I wanted to wait. This was my present after a very long and lonely vacation. I would have to wait until Ellen got home, if she wanted me to. The thought of being with her made me feel like such a young and immature male.</p> <p>I thought about how much I had wanted to go out with her and now she didn't want to see me. Maybe, just maybe we could make a date. Just maybe, I was the one to make the change she wanted. I was going to have to wait until Ellen got home Saturday afternoon to tell her that I was going to be with her. I had to tell her one more time that she had to pick up dinner, and then I had to go out on a date with her.</p> <p>I got home after work and had already finished having dinner with my parents and had been waiting for Ellen to make the choice, when she got home. It was after 6.30 and I thought I would wait for my parent's call and surprise Ellen. After all, the dinner was a big day and I would have to watch my parents.</p> <p>As we sat talking, she was still very happy to see me. She said, "I thought you would never be there."</p> <p>"I'll tell you when I get here."</p> <p>"Can't wait."</p> <p>"So, who is the other man at this party?"</p> <p>"You, Dad."</p> <p>"That would be Tom. He's very special."</p> <p>"He's got no problem with you being there."</p> <p>"How can you tell? He already knows."</p> <p>"Yes, he does.
