He was tall, built like a basketball player. He was in very good shape, just slightly over six feet tall, a slight roundness to his body in some places. He was wearing a pair of loose jeans that hung low on his hips. His shirt was thin enough to show off his muscular chest, and I saw her mouth drop open when he looked down at her.</p> <p>He pulled her in to a tight hug, kissing her forehead while doing so. I could feel her warmth. He stepped on a ladder and pulled her into his large, hard body, pressing up against her as he wrapped his arms around her.</p> <p>I knew I should be mad at them, but the feelings I was giving them as they held me were mind blowing. I stood in the shadow of the door as this was the first and only time I would ever have sex with someone new.</p> <p>He put his arms around her, but not with any feeling of intimacy. He held her firmly to him. She was still holding tightly to him, and I was sure she sensed me standing there with them. I couldn't move, I watched her face. She looked as if she were looking for the faintest trace of a smile to show she did indeed know that they had just given each other a night of pleasure.</p> <p>I pulled her in just to the side of us, her face so close to mine. I could smell the scent of her hair. She had on the scent of a woman who was just ready - and ready - to take her time. I would have let her, but I wanted to make sure the act as much as possible.</p> <p>I moved my face back and put my lips to hers, then kissed her, running my tongue slowly up her chin, then her neck, down her chest to her stomach moving ever so slowly back to the top of her breast.</p> <p>I heard her moan as I brought my lips down her stomach. I could see she was watching my every move - and then I slid down her stomach and down to her panties. She opened her eyes.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" She asked. "I told you to take them off."</p> <p>"Are you mad?" I asked, as I took each of her hips and moved her panties, sliding them down off of her and tossing them back to land on the bed.</p> <p>When I had them off, she was beautiful. I could see her dark, beautiful hair fall down around her. I took each of her toes in my hands, then the little brown ones, as I moved my face back across to hers to repeat the process. I looked at her lips to see her pink lips spread open. I moved forward, kissing the inside of her ear, then sliding over to her lips, which were still kissing in a similar manner.</p> <p>She closed her eyes again, allowing herself to move as if by instinct. With an opening, I slipped my tongue inside her mouth and could feel her sucking on it.</p> <p>She was responding more eagerly to our kiss, the way her hands were still around my face, now holding me close. Her arms were wrapping me tightly against her. One of her nails traced and then sank in the skin between my navel and chest, and as that finger ran down the line of my hip she pushed it into my body.</p> <p>She didn't waste any time, or say a word as she sucked on my tongue. It didn't matter. I broke our kiss and started my exploration of her body. Slowly licking up to her ear, my hands still wrapped around her. Her legs were spread wide and her hips pushed at the back of my head as I licked her to a few more points on either side of her neck.</p> <p>A slow moan escaped her lips as I kissed my way to the side of her neck once more. I pulled her closer to me. I slid my hand down and caressed her ass. She let out a small whimper as I caressed her. As I took my face away and started to move my head from side to side, I looked down at her.</p> <p>A look of sheer excitement and fear came over her face as she realized I was looking at her. I kissed her lips gently, and moved to her neck. I gently bit down on first one, then the other, kissing her lips and the tender flesh of her neck. I worked my way downward.</p> <p>I kissed down the side of her chest, letting my breasts brush the skin on her chest. She shuddered as she realized what I was going to do. I worked my hands to her sides, sliding up to her breasts, kneading her flesh, feeling her nipples grow to firm peaks. I rolled them between my thumb and forefinger in an almost teasing manner. She gasped and put her hands on my headâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
