She said smiling.</p> <p>"Ok but you have a little time." I said as I went over to my workstation and sat down in my chair.</p> <p>"You are right." She said as she came back in.</p> <p>"I am the worst and I know it, but we have to find a way. Please, can you come this weekend? I am on a business trip and there is really no way that will turn into a normal weekend."</p> <p>"I agree, but no I will leave right away."</p> <p>"Ok but you have to drive."</p> <p>"Sure but I have nowhere else I want to be and you are the last person on earth."</p> <p>"Deal, I'll try to be as fair as I can. See you Friday night." She said as she got up to leave.</p> <p>I went home and went nuts. A couple of drinks, a few glasses and then a shower and I knew I was going to have to take a break and go back.</p> <p>I got in bed and watched some mindless tv as I replayed the last 15 minutes of her kissing and touching. I came up with a million reasons to make it up to her tonight.</p> <p>I heard her come in and close the door and then I heard her voice say quietly "I am not the one."</p> <p>The first thing I did that got me into the closet was close myself on the bed. I took off her shoes and set them right on the end table and then slid back on my other side so that my head was facing away from me. This gave my face some space and not a lot to stare at right away.</p> <p>Next I took her shirt off and pulled it back over her head and I started to rub her stomach and her sides from her shoulders to her hips where my hands were resting softly.</p> <p>I heard her take in a deep breath and she said, "No, I cannot make love here in my apartment and get this wrong. So I am not going to just be sleeping here as a lover. You see this is just for a little fun, so I am going to make the best of it. This is for a little relief and maybe a bit of excitement."</p> <p>The last thing I really wanted to do was make her cry over something so I didn't say anything. I started to rub her legs and worked my way closer until I could smell the scent of her perfume.</p> <p>"No no no no." She said as she moved a leg behind my head. I kept rubbing her legs as I got closer to the object of love.</p> <p>"Honey, I am not going to be the only one." She said as she grabbed my hand in hers and pulled it away. "I love you too and just can't do anything."</p> <p>"Oh you two can't do anything right now." I said as I continued to rub her legs. I got a better idea and slid down to her feet and got onto her toes so that I could massage her foot to get her to relax.</p> <p>"We could change the sheets or something. That would be great." I said softly.</p> <p>"No wait." She said as she sat up. "It is going to be ok."</p> <p>I watched intently as she got up and turned the bathroom lights off but it didn't slow the lust that raced through my veins. I moved closer to her so that it was her that came out of the bathroom, naked and laying on her back so that I could get a better view.</p> <p>I started to rub her neck, shoulders and her back as I went to rub her arms. By the time I reached her elbows I already knew why I was taking such long and deep breathes. I rubbed her lower back gently, first gently and then with increasing pressure as I started to get more bold.</p> <p>I put my finger on the crack of her ass and then used my free hand to massage her ass cheeks. She let out small moans and I watched as her legs shook from her pleasure.</p> <p>I had worked up her legs and was rubbing her calves and thighs as I leaned over her and started to kiss her neck every now and then.</p> <p>"Oh honey, that feels so good." She said softly. I was now in between her legs and was rubbing her calves and then moving higher, moving my hands around her thighs and feeling her skin. I stopped at her knees and just looked again.</p> <p>I looked at her and said, "You can see that I am going to do this at the end. So just relax and enjoy." I kissed her as I moved further down her leg until I was on top of her.</p> <p>She looked at me and smiled as she felt my breath and smiled backâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
