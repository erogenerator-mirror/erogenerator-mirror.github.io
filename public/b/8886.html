When I finally pulled into the drive, I almost ran to the front entrance and rang the bell to let the girls in. "I've got to get out of here" I said, almost pleading, "I've got to find someone for me right now. I need someone to love and protect me."</p> <p>The girl in the car looked up at me briefly, then walked over and hugged me. "I don't think you'd be needing anyone right now, Mister, you just relax and enjoy your evening meal, okay, Honey?" She said. "How 'bout it, stud. You going to be my 'sick man' for the evening? I don't know, Jim. I'd hate to see you getting too excited. I think you would just have to hold out until you're sober enough to relax a little. You'll be all right."</p> <p>"Thanks, Mel, don't worry." I said. "I'm so glad you're here. I'm getting in a taxi right down there. Do you mind if we share yours here? I think we'll be safe with your coat and those nice warm jackets you wear when you're feeling frisky."</p> <p>Mel looked at me and said. "Jim, this is a pretty nice place. I'm sure you're not trying to steal girls away from me, I'm just looking forward to seeing you again."</p> <p>"Well, no. I'm just glad to have found someone to warm up to." And we headed across the drive towards my place. The cab opened just as Mel reached into her coat and pulled my driver's side door open to let my man out. She had been watching and smiling as I was getting out of the cab before we left and her eyes were sparkling as she took my hand to help me out of the cab. We embraced briefly, then she pulled back and looked me in the eyes and said, "Mister, if I could only see you up close for a few seconds. You look much healthier. I feel much better now!"</p> <p>"You're pretty amazing yourself, Mel. If I didn't know it, I'd be happy to share your coat with you." I said as I placed my jacket on the back seat with the other coats. "Your coat's so good for your man that the outside of it might catch fire if we get in a fight."</p> <p>"Oh, we will. Your jacket will do all the talking on your coat. I promise to behave." Mel said. "It's just hard to just stand back and watch you guys take off from the restaurant. Just take your time, Jim."</p> <p>She walked along behind me and watched as my coat fell to my ankles. It was a bit of a dress and I think it showed a bit too much cleavage. Mel knew I was about to get arrested for indecent exposure and I certainly didn't care as she led me through the lobby and up the walk. She led me into the bar right inside the restaurant. We got our coats and I paid a hefty fee of fifty bucks. Now for the first time in my life, I was about to stand on the other side of the bar being paid fifty bucks to have a drink with a friend of mine. The girl at the reception desk was doing a great job looking me over. All she had to do was smile and say hello and you might as well say hello to someone you already knew that person. Her smile never left her face at all as we headed out in the lobby. The first few people we passed seemed to be couples who had a few drinks too soon and then began to leave quickly towards the back. We kept going for another ten minutes or so as we went through the hotel lobby and toward our table. A few of the guys from the other tables near the door waved her on, but she waved back and said, "Thanks, Jim. These guys are going to love you." She stood up to take her coat from the front of her coat and we followed her out in our car. Her coat barely hung up at our feet. This car looked really nice, but for me, this was the most expensive car I ever owned.</p> <p>It drove around the streets for the rest of the evening. The only people we knew were about thirty-five or so and they were nice to talk to and enjoy their time together. Mel spent most of her time on the dance floor, not even being able to dance with the guy who had helped me into this hotel on the other hand. She danced for him in various states of undress at first, but mostâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
