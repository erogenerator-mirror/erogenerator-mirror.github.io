I move to the counter, looking her over for a minute, and suddenly I can't help myself, she's gorgeous. She seems to have more curves than I'd imagine on such short a frame, but even so I think she's dressed for the summer. My eyes quickly travel up to her eyes, I see their green, and for a split second I am reminded of the sight of her naked on our bed in the moonlight, I realize I've made quite a mental comparison, and it brings my eyes back to her face. I smile, and move the register out of their way for her to check.</p> <p>"So, it would seem we've finally gotten you settled, do you remember?" she asks the cashier. "Oh yeah, I was just about to call you a cab when the bell rung, but it sounded like a cab on this street."</p> <p>As she turns toward the other shop owners, she says "The bell rung" in her best southern drawl, and I watch as she moves behind one of the tables and bends over the counter. My eyes follow and register that sexy ass, and I try not to take my eyes off it when she bends over.</p> <p>This is going to be a fun nightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
