She felt that he was aware that nothing was going to stop the conversation from going back to their conversation but she was afraid to get too carried away. "I'm fine," she said. He didn't say anything else about it, so she thought it would be best to leave it at that. Instead, she reached down and undid the belt of her robe. It fell to the ground in a heap around her ankles, leaving her completely exposed to his scrutiny. He took it off completely and looked at it for a moment; then he looked down at her. "I thought we said I wouldn't be the first one wearing this when we got to being so private," he said.</p> <p>"That's right. It's just a gift." She giggled. That was the most erotic greeting they'd had in a long time. She turned around with her back to him and leaned forward to show off her gorgeous breasts that he was only too aware of from the corner of his eye. She was wearing nothing but a tiny piece of material between her legs. He'd been staring at her breasts for a long time, his hand unconsciously trying to reach out and touch them, to feel the contours of the silky material that covered their cleavage. It didn't help his hard-on, of course. He couldn't get close enough to feel it.</p> <p>"Let's get rid of your clothes so we can sit and admire the work," he suggested. She looked over her shoulder at him with pleading eyes, and he just nodded. She stepped out of her robe and reached behind her, unclasping her bra. "Are there any limits around this?" she asked.</p> <p>"There's no limit. I'd love to play but I'm afraid." She felt a little embarrassed. She liked his attention, a little. Plus, what was a couple hours if he couldn't keep himself entertained?</p> <p>"Okay,"she said as she slipped off her panties and stood before him, completely nude. Her breasts were a bit paler than the others—probably a sign that she wasn't used to being naked any longer. But she did have a small, puffy pussy that was shaved smooth and was a treat to see. A few days ago, she had waxed her toenails, and they always looked just like her husband's. Now she was bare, in fact, and showing off her gorgeous body to him just felt a little different. She looked down at herself, realizing that he would be able to see up the little bit of her body that it wasn't covered in, so much as to have an unimpeded view of her nakedness. She ran her fingers over her pussy-coated labia, making sure he was taking in everything, letting him be a part of it.</p> <p>"Mmmm...that's nice...if there's any limitations to your enjoyment, so long as you're discrete," she said, sliding a finger deep into her pussy. He looked at her.</p> <p>"I want to make you feel good. I want to make you feel good." That's not really all that the word is, isn't it? "I'm sure that if you were as open as you could get yourself," she added, sliding another finger in, "I think a lot more will come of it."</p> <p>"Oh, I think there's a lot." He reached out with his other hand and took off his pants. His erect penis bobbed in front of him.</p> <p>"Are you ready to slide your dick right into me?" she said as he slid his pants off, revealing his cock. "It looks just like a normal dick." He was still wearing his boxers, so he was surprised to see her reach underneath to grasp it at the base.</p> <p>"Well, I was hoping it would be this nice and big. I can guarantee that it'll feel a lot bigger than usual." He reached down and started stroking his cock, his eyes on hers. She took his cock in her hand and started running her hand up and down it—faster and faster at first, and when she moved her hand up and down, her eyes locked onto his. She was amazed. It's been so long since she's had some kind of penis. A penis-penis-penis-Penis and her hand-hand-penis. She was stroking her husband's very hard cock; he was still wearing his shorts. "Will you give it a rest for me?" she asked. She wanted him to see how long he could last. For once he was going to get pleasure in watching her play with herself and make him feel good. He smiled back at her and leaned forward, pulling his dick out of her grasp—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
