I just think you could give us a call if you wanted something of special significance to the story... and maybe that would be nice."</p> <p>After hearing the name I was not surprised. It was just something I had noticed that I had often heard from my past... in the future. I would tell him later, I could never live without that. He would like hearing about what I had, and I did want to bring it up.</p> <p>I sat silently as the story unfolded, and when it finished I got up and walked over, sat down beside him. "I'll tell you what happened, sweetheart, but I'm here the same time next week." I said. He sat there, still not able to take it all in. "Now, why don't you go back to your house and take that long bath and I'll make sure you are feeling better this morning, so you won't get any more headaches. And you can keep the pill so you're safe to have sex again... and I'll think about how much I love you." I put my arms around him as he sat there crying.</p> <p>He looked up at me and smiled. "I'd like that very much, you know..."</p> <p>"Me, too. It's no use having any secrets." I leaned over and kissed him and then he said, "See you around five."</p> <p>I turned to look out the window as I walked out of the house and towards my bed. My mind was spinning and I really didn't have to go to work until the next day. I had planned all of this, but the whole trip to the hospital and into town was way too much. But at five he was going to be there, and there'd be no reason to go home and be in bed for a long time.</p> <p>It occurred to me that I didn't want to tell my father and that I shouldn't have allowed it. But I didn't really want to. It was what I wanted to say to him... about him... all through dinner, but I was afraid the whole thing would never come up again. I took a seat on the bed, and leaned over to my little girl, "Oh, and Daddy? I'm sorry I didn't make it up to you."</p> <p>He looked surprised. "Me neither, sweetheart, but how could I help you?"</p> <p>"I'd do anything you asked of me," I said, "And I know you'll do anything you ask of me... everything... I just want to tell you how much you mean to me. How grateful I am to you... that you'll let me be near you. I'd do anything you wanted."</p> <p>"If it makes you feel all right," I said, "and I might, that is, if you do what you want... you have to make up your mind."</p> <p>He looked relieved. "If anyone is going to make me feel all right, I'd be proud."</p> <p>****</p> <p>I was getting ready for the day. When I came out of my bedroom in just my bra and panties, I pulled my hair back into a ponytail. As I walked across the hall, I couldn't help but notice how well I looked. I wasn't overly pretty, for God's sake. My face didn't look that girl next to me... my mouth was too small and my hair was a shade too long. My figure was toned... I didn't have to work to have that body, and my makeup was pretty much right: I wore it naturally, my nails always brushed up along my arms. My legs weren't particularly long, and I knew from seeing my own reflection in the mirror that my bottom wasn't that short and my breasts were well defined. As I walked towards my Daddy, I smiled a little bit self pityingly and said, "Hi Daddy..."</p> <p>He looked at me... he smiled weakly. "Hi sweetheart... How are you this morning?" He looked at me again and said, "Very happy today."</p> <p>"How about today?" I said quietly.</p> <p>"You mean today?" He looked puzzled. "I was kind of worried about whether you would like to have sex again."</p> <p>"Yes!" I said excitedly. "I mean, how could I let you? This can't get any better... I'm just so happy."</p> <p>"Don't worry, baby, this is what the story tells you." His answer was not anything sexual at all. He sat patiently on my bed as I slipped into my panties and bra.</p> <p>"What happened so long ago?" He stood in front of me and I took his big hands in mine.</p> <p>"I have no idea..." I said.</p> <p>"But we do have some information that weâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
