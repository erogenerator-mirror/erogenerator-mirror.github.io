I said. I felt embarrassed as he sat there looking out of the window.</p> <p>"Yeah, when I saw the pictures on your computer I know you had your panties under your clothes. It was exciting. Now I want you to be mine. It's your choice but I'd really like it if you'd let me make you come when I've got here."</p> <p>I was aghast. No way could this be happening. I couldn't let anyone know that I'd been having sex with the man of my dreams.</p> <p>"I-I don't know. I've never done anything like this," I stammered.</p> <p>"Well, that's no fun for you is it?" he joked. I'd gone from shyness to being excited like I hadn't since I was a kid. Now I was standing there with this man talking to me and not a single thing I could say to defend myself.</p> <p>"No, it's not that. I just don't want to be your girlfriend and not have you come. I'll never go for that. And you won't do it. I'll do it." I stood there in the car for a minute thinking all kinds of horrible things but all in the end I decided to go along with whatever he wanted.</p> <p>"I'll go with you." I said and grabbed the keys on the floor where I'd thrown my clothes earlier.</p> <p>"No! Don't go!" he replied but he gave me a quick push and I was out of the car and over to his house. As I got out of the car I was looking over my shoulder and he was staring at me with what I thought was hope but in fact was pretty much just lust. As I reached the door I could see he'd already stripped off his clothes and was stepping out of his boxers as I handed him my keys. He was smiling at me when he grabbed my panties and yanked them up my legs.</p> <p>"You don't have to do this." I said but I didn't really care. My pussy tingled when he pulled my panties up my legs and I was completely nude and exposed to anyone who cared to look. He tossed my panties on the floor then he grabbed his cock and guided it into me. The shock of this new sensation and his excitement made me scream a little.</p> <p>He held my legs around his shoulders as he began thrusting into me harder and faster. I looked over at him as he began to really get in the mood to fuck me. I had never done this before but I wasn't prepared for the intensity and excitement of this. He began to really pound into me and I was starting to wonder if I'd really be able to keep him away from me.</p> <p>By this time he was standing behind me, completely naked and enjoying the feel of my nakedness against him. I felt so powerless and yet so at the same time. The feeling of power had never really left me and it was as strong as it was exciting and exciting, he knew it. He leaned over and pulled some rope from the wall behind me and tied me to the bed. He was still thrusting into me and I just kept screaming. His cock was so fat it was pushing against me every time he drove it home.</p> <p>It was all I could do to maintain myself. My legs felt like they were going to buckle if he wasn't behind. He kept pounding into me hard and fast and I was really starting to shake.</p> <p>"Oh god, I'm starting to come. I'm coming! I'm coming inside you!"</p> <p>It wasn't the first time I'd came while making love to him. I'd even found a way to stay on my hands and knees without moving to either side. I'd also tried to keep my legs close together with just the tips of my feet. But it had been awhile to do it now.</p> <p>He continued to pound into me through my convulsions and my pussy became still. I was shaking from exertion and the shock of the sensations I had just taken and the shock of the orgasm I'd had only moments ago. I was going to come again. All he had to do was go back and finish the job. He lifted his eyes to meet mine as he thrust into me again and again. My pussy was soaking wet and the orgasm was starting to be replaced by ecstasy.</p> <p>"I'm coming," she said in a voice that said he may want to cum with me again.</p> <p>I wasn't hearing her voice at all though. This time I was just looking at her. He thrust in and out as his cum continued to pump out of his cock. I came all over the bed.</p> <p>He looked up at me but didn't say a word.
