He turned the music down then pulled her to him and he kissed her passionately. She took his head in her hands and pulled him to her again and kissed him deeper. He started moving his hands up and down her body, pulling her hips closer to him and massaging her butt with his. She ran both hands down his chest and felt his strong, muscular arms and chest. He stopped kissing her long enough to push her down on one of the tables.</p> <p>"That's it. Don't stop, don't ever stop touching me."</p> <p>She turned him inwards and kissed up the front of his shirt. Just to tease him and to get his attention, she unbuckled his belt and unzipped his pants.</p> <p>"You have an amazing cock," she said as she unbuttoned the pants and slowly pulled them down his legs.</p> <p>"You better stop. You know I'm going to take you for my personal trainer tonight. How do you think Mike would take it?" he said as his cock emerged from the fly of his briefs and stood at attention almost straight up against his stomach.</p> <p>"I would say it's very pretty. I'd like to put it in my mouth," she said as she reached between her own legs. She guided the tip of his cock to her opening and slowly pushed down onto him.</p> <p>He held on to her hips as he pulled her down onto him, trying to prolong the moment.</p> <p>"I'm going to give you a very, very special feeling tonight," she said as she looked at his expression. "Are you ready" she asked.</p> <p>He nodded. He could feel her pressing down on him until she was sitting atop his cock, holding the base in place. When he felt the weight of her weight on him, he started bucking his hips. She leaned forward to kiss him again, then moved to grab the waist band of his briefs. "Take them off," she ordered. He raised his hips to give her access. She pulled the band tight but released the waistband so it wouldn't leave a tenting in his briefs. She pulled the briefs down and over his cock. He could feel the pressure of her fingers around his hardness, slowly dragging their tips off his shaft. As soon as she had the briefs off, she leaned forward to lick his balls. The feeling of her tongue running through his nut sac and around his balls was electrifying. She licked them and then took each and then into her mouth. He lifted himself up to allow her to sit on top of him, then slid back down, taking his cock between his legs and pushing his thighs in to the middle of hers. They rocked against each other for a few minutes until the weight settled on his legs. Both of their breathing had quickened.</p> <p>"I think you've had enough," she said. "We both have. Just let me know when."</p> <p>He lay there with his eyes closed for a moment. He didn't move.</p> <p>"I think we both have," she said, smiling.</p> <p>She kissed his chest as his cock slid between their bodies. "I've never done that," she said with a smile.</p> <p>"Neither has I. But we both haven't," he said as he kissed her. "Let's do it all over again, ok."</p> <p>He rolled them and got up on his knees to do the same. He was amazed at just how sexy it was to have a person laying against her; they both were. He moved his hips and felt around until he found the right place for what he was looking for. He took her breasts in his hands and started flicking and massaging. She squealed. He stopped for a minute and then started working her nipples between his fingers. She lifted her hips off of the table to meet him. He could feel the moisture on her pussy as he moved.</p> <p>"That feels really good," she sighed.</p> <p>"Your nipples are as hard as rocks when you do that," he said with some amusement.</p> <p>He was able to get her to lie down on him and he moved to straddle her, his hands coming up over her stomach to her navel and on up to her breasts. He started in on her nipples, gently massaging them.</p> <p>"Don't just do it."</p> <p>He took both breasts into his large hands and used his tongue to circle her nipples. She closed her eyes in response. He flicked them with his tongue, then teased them into the tip of his tongue. He sucked her entire areola into his mouth and rolled it around with his tongue, circling, flicking, pinching. Moving up, he moved the sides of her breasts together so he could lick them both at the same time.
