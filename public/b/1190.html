"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have, but I...I just couldn't help it."</p> <p>"No," he shook his head. He sat back at the table, and she looked over at him curiously. "It's alright, and this is your fault. I couldn't help it. Now that you're gone I really hate to see you like that."</p> <p>"It's ok, Josh, you're just a kid all along."</p> <p>"And I'll get over it," he chuckled and looked up and grinned at her, "But I still don't understand why you think that would bother you, I'm trying to find my own way out."</p> <p>"Maybe there'd be a way out for you," Amanda stated, "but what do you think, I'm not sure if you'd want the best part of that right there. Would you like a drink or something? I can get you one if you like, I have plenty."</p> <p>"I'd like a glass of milk if you have any, I can't drink that much, but I'll keep it here."</p> <p>"Right, well, you'll just have to get a glass, I'll find the milk and make sure I get good service. So I'll see you back at the apartment," she said and walked over to where she sat and opened the bottle of milk, pouring some of the milk into a glass.</p> <p>"You know I love the way you think," Amanda said as she poured herself a glass of milk, "I'm not really sure if you're going to say anything, but if you don't want to make it then you have my number."</p> <p>"Oh, ok, I'll see you there," he laughed with her and she quickly put on her jeans and went down the steps and to their room.</p> <p>While she took the water from the kitchen, she checked the thermostat and decided that it was a little chilly and the fridge and cupboards were unoccupied, she had put a new pot of water on the stove to keep things warm. She heard him open the door and as she walked towards the front of the apartment, she stopped dead and started to get nervous.</p> <p>"Is everything alright, Josh?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I think so. It's just that your mom and I had a really tough morning."</p> <p>"Oh, thanks, you're...well..."</p> <p>"Oh no, it's fine. She has such a wonderful home and I really appreciate it."</p> <p>"Well, I'm sorry that I was such a fool, you don't know how many times she called, and I knew that I couldn't help you," she smiled at him.</p> <p>"No, not at all. It was nice, too. I should have listened a little better to all her advice," Josh smiled and kissed her on the cheek.</p> <p>"I would have made up my mind if you were leaving," she laughed as she handed him the glass of milk. She closed the refrigerator and took her keys out and went and got her keys out. "No need for a car, I can drive. It's only a short walk and it's not too far."</p> <p>"Sure, I don't have anything that I'd rather to take. I'll just grab the keys on the way," he shook his head and turned to leave.</p> <p>"Thank you, Josh, I really enjoyed your company."</p> <p>"I enjoyed it too," he smiled and they reached the door. The apartment was empty save for him and Amanda and their bags.</p> <p>"Thanks!" Amanda exclaimed and walked away, pulling the keys to the car. "I'll let you have your car while I go ahead and get it ready."</p> <p>"Thanks, I appreciate that," he put the car in drive and put the bags in the rental car. He drove out and got his car, started the car and turned around to head back towards home. Amanda looked down at her phone, and saw that she had been sitting for about 20 minutes, and wondered what was on the schedule if they had planned on her doing anything else tonight. He was right, of course.</p> <p>After arriving home, Amanda took off her jeans and tank top and followed Josh up the stairs. Josh knocked on the door and Amanda opened it and got in before him. "Thank you," she said and kissed him. It never left her mind as all Josh knew was that she was incredibly turned on that night. That first time she had cum while she was sucking him off, but she also had to admit the way he was treating herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
