I took a moment to savor the sensation of my hand gliding down my stomach and into my panties.</p> <p>Then I brought my hands under the elastic. Her hips and pussy were still gyrating as I slid all the way into her as far as I could. I felt how tight she was and that didn't last long. Once again, she pulled my hair and whispered how much it had turned her on and how much she loved the feeling of being taken roughly.</p> <p>“Oh my God you feel so fucking good” she breathed and kissed me again. It wasn’t long before she was grinding her pelvis into mine as she ground her pussy against my hand. Then the hand between us that had been playing with her clit was pulling me down on it again. As I had before there was no turning back this time. She was riding me like a bucking bronco. She was panting and moaning. She was breathing hard, I'm sure for a woman in her forties.</p> <p>“Oh God you feel so good,” she whispered between gasps of breath. I could feel my own orgasm building. Soon I had to take off a shoe and she turned around again. “We aren’t done.” She said as she removed her bra.</p> <p>I was amazed but still couldn't move, there was no stopping me. I sat up and then leaned in to her, our tongues met again as my hand dropped to her clit and it was out in the open. Her hips were going wild as our tongues danced around each other. She moved backwards and had me on my knees. I didn't go any farther. It had been years since my husband’s hands had touched my bare skin. I didn’t care anymore, all that mattered was my own desire.</p> <p>She rolled over with a groan. “Yes baby, yes oh yeah don’t stop” she continued until her back was in my belly. She was now on top of me, her hands were on my breasts, squeezing them. She had one hand working on the nipples and the other on my pussy, running her fingers across my labia gently. She kissed me with everything she had. As my hand fell to her pussy, I felt how wet she was. Her hips were grinding all the time so that my hand slid easily into her. “Oh honey, oh honey” she moaned then pushed down hard and let go, she exploded and came a second time, her cunt gripped my hand for a second then opened and then closed again.</p> <p>Her orgasm brought me over the edge too, and as she rode my palm, my orgasm exploded. I was cumming and cumming and she felt my climax shoot deep deep inside her belly. I was panting, trying to catch my breath as she rubbed my clit and my clit and my fingers as my whole body convulsed in another orgasm.</p> <p>I was finally conscious enough to look down at my naked body. It was like the moonlight had come back and I felt as gorgeous and sexy as I had always been.</p> <p>The whole thing only lasted an erotic hour just sitting there. My hair, my chest, my legs and everything else felt sordid in our embrace. When I recovered, it was time for the next part of the program. I took her by the hand and led her into the water. I told her what I had planned and she was in no way offended. As it was a late summer evening, the moonlight streamed in over and through the deck and the trees. Soon the water was heated.</p> <p>Once in the water, she sat back against the wall, as I had a chair next to my legs and we stood side-by-side. She looked so beautiful. I was getting close to her but I was also afraid of her reaction. She didn’t see my eyes.</p> <p>“No, don’t.” Her voice was a whisper, but I could tell that she had wanted me to, I was almost ready to tell her about the other night. She held out both hands and said something. Then she pulled me tightly against her, her arms hugged me hard all the way around me and again we kissed. It wasn’t a passionate kiss, it wasn’t like any kiss she ever had. It was tender and loving and wonderful. When she pulled away from our kiss, I got up and began to lead her out of the water.</p> <p>“I’m sorry babe but I think we’re done here.” my husband, John, yelled at her.</p> <p>“I know and I want to go to the house to spend the night.” I told her as I handed her my hand holding out mine—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
