I said to her.</p> <p>"Oh, that was a big help." she said as she lifted her head as if she too was going to sleep again. She looked like she was about to pass out again.</p> <p>"Yeah I have to get an extra shirt today." I said as I reached around and pulled on the one remaining shirt I didn't have on.</p> <p>"I thought it would be nice if you stayed." she said as she slipped her arm around my waist. And she didn't say you were leaving. When she spoke her voice had changed. It was deeper, and more husky, and more seductive. Like I had lost control of myself and had to put it out of my head before I blew it all to hell. I knew I didn't have any control in this relationship or what was in front of me. My thoughts and reactions to seeing her face made me feel guilty.</p> <p>I tried to get some sort of explanation out of her. "I don't feel guilty. It's just that I was just about to leave your house and go to the men's club you go to."</p> <p>"No you're not. My mind was somewhere else." she said as she gave me a weak smile and gave her hand a squeeze. I was having all kinds of thoughts about what she meant. I just knew I would keep my mouth to myself.</p> <p>Her hand left my body, and her hips were once more at my side as she pulled me to the couch and we sat there again.</p> <p>"So, do you want to stop talking and watch an old movie?" I asked, trying to give her some sort of reassurance.</p> <p>"Well it's just that, well, I haven't gotten a good enough look at it yet. So, if you wanna, um, go to it with me then maybe we can skip the main event, right?" she said, trying to push me back on the couch. It was obvious that she wanted to stay here. I didn't have anything else I would be interested in. I didn't even think about taking off. It had nothing to do with her.</p> <p>"Um, ok, sure, I would love to go with you." I said, relieved that I wouldn't have to come around in the middle of her. I really couldn't see myself spending any time in her company. I could feel that I just wanted a quick thing. So, even though I couldn't see her face I could be sure she wasn't telling the truth.</p> <p>"I don't have anywhere to go." she said.</p> <p>"You should." I said, taking one last look at her and then turning to get up on the couch. She quickly grabbed my hand and pulled me to her, sitting me between her and the armrest. I sat there for a moment in silence just trying to get some sort of explanation out of the situation.</p> <p>"So this is just a two way street, huh?" the voice in my head said. It seemed so normal and normal.</p> <p>"Not really. It can be good. And, I don't see where this is anything but okay." I said trying to look at the ceiling.</p> <p>"This is so easy for you to say." she said.</p> <p>"I'm just not sure this is what you mean." I said, not able to think of an argument I wanted to put on her shoulders.</p> <p>"No, it isn't. You want to do something about it." she said with a smile.</p> <p>"Well that's not fair." I said honestly.</p> <p>"I'll admit, sometimes I can be a little aggressive." she said as her hand slid off my leg and moved to my thigh. She began to rub my skin. It was hard to keep from moving my leg around as she rubbed. It seemed like our talk was pushing away the feelings I had. It was just so difficult to sit there with her soft hands as her hand worked me. It didn't seem like she was in any hurry to make a move on me or anything, though it was certainly tempting to do so.</p> <p>"Are you getting any ideas?" I said as she lifted her hand up and looked down at my hand. She got a naughty smile on her face when she did that. Maybe I should have said something with a little bit more confidence. I think she knew I wasn't buying that, though.</p> <p>"Yeah. I think I'm just getting more comfortable with our relationship." I said looking at her. The hand that rested on my thigh was moving up and down a little bit. She looked up at me and moved her hand from my thigh to her other.</p> <p>"Are you sure this is all you want from me?" she askedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
