Can I try my hand?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I like the way this feels. You sure you haven't lost your touch, though? And, do you want to try one or two?"</p> <p>"Nope, I want to try my hand, too."</p> <p>"We can get on with that."</p> <p>They found a nice quiet corner between the wall and sofa, and got started.</p> <p>They played several game pieces of different types of music, and then played a number about a guy's job.</p> <p>The woman who sat across from them said, "You know you like the songs."</p> <p>"Yes. I do. How could I not?" He replied.</p> <p>"Don't ask the wrong question. I like the songs. I mean, you're talking to me in my ear and you're looking at, like, pretty things. So, tell me how it feels."</p> <p>As they played, the woman continued to make suggestions. The music started, and she picked up her cards.</p> <p>"Do the 'em."</p> <p>"And, what," I asked.</p> <p>"Your right, they're nice. And, I like playing cards."</p> <p>"Good, it'll help keep the excitement coming back. Just try and do the thing that makes you crazy enough to let it happen."</p> <p>The card game was fun again, but before too long we were all having fun. In spite of the game's location, our orgasms were very powerful. Then came the second game, and we decided that the 'fun' was over.</p> <p>"It's too dark to see, so lets lie down and just go to sleep."</p> <p>We laid down and listened to a lovely track, then heard the music softly.</p> <p>After several minutes of silence, I said, "We've come to this conclusion, but we don't really want to leave now."</p> <p>"It's late, then. Let's sit down and say it and hold it for a moment," said the lady. "That means that we have to be ready to talk at least once a night on an impulse. After that, we are free to leave, if we want to. You just want to enjoy the company of women again."</p> <p>All of us were quiet as we sat and listened to music for a long time, and then the lady said, "Well, maybe we should just talk tomorrow. You have to be ready for that if we want to do anything else."</p> <p>I said, "I might give it a try tomorrow. I hope I'm not too heavy-headed. I can feel my penis get hard."</p> <p>It was very quiet, then: the music, even when we were in the dark. Then, a female voice said, "I think the ladies are feeling a little rough. I'm not feeling much. Come back next month with my cards."</p> <p>"I know who you are, so you can join us tomorrow and you can make me feel better. That ought to do."</p> <p>"Yes, and, one more thing to say: thank you for calling me. I enjoyed our time together and I really thought that it was going to be nice."</p> <p>She smiled at me, raised her hand, and gave me a very sexy look. She was beautiful in her dark green bikini. Our conversation resumed in a similar fashion to the first one. She then leaned over and leaned into me. She put her hands over mine for a long while, pressing her breasts against my chest. When we were a bit dry, we just lay next to each other, as I caressed her lovely body.</p> <p>As the song ended, we got up and made the bed, making a big mess. We went out to the sofa and had some more sex on the cushions next to the bed.</p> <p>After the next day, we were sitting on the terrace after having coffee and talking. I said, "I hope that it will stop as I feel the way that I do with you. I'm not that far from you though, so be prepared for a trip as we go through a sort of 'happen-to' routine."</p> <p>"Maybe we can take your car."</p> <p>"You know my husband's car. If it's not too much trouble, I could drive you around," I said.</p> <p>"The other option is for me to drive you. That should be nice."</p> <p>"You're asking too much. You'll see."</p> <p>We agreed that we would talk more tomorrow about my situation with her husband, and the game that she had planned for us for the weekend, and our next stop.</p> <p>We then decided that after we had made the coffee and a snack—najib, cheese, bagels, and crackers——</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
