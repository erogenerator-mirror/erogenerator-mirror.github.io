She hesitated. "I, er... er..." She turned over the papers in her hands. "This is all that you say," she said, as innocently as possible. "I was..."</p> <p>I leaned over the edge of the bed with one leg propped up to take another sip from my glass. "We're done," I said.</p> <p>"But..."</p> <p>"And? You?"</p> <p>"It's not you," she answered quickly, "not this."</p> <p>"But it's the past," She tried to move away. "I'm just a girl."</p> <p>"Yes. And you're a horny girl."</p> <p>She leaned in and began to lick her lips. "How do you know?" She asked.</p> <p>"Well, the thought of having you again filled me with desire," I confessed again. "When I saw you again, every nerve in my body went to end."</p> <p>"I wanted to make sure that you were ready," she continued, "not just with me."</p> <p>"I was," I said slowly. "So was your boyfriend."</p> <p>"He's not you," she said, with no apparent emotion. "He's a girl," she added, as she placed a hand atop my chest again.</p> <p>"He has been," I said, looking up, hoping she would finish, "and so does your father."</p> <p>"And, of course, your Father did," she said almost sadly, her eyes going through the same motions. "But there's more."</p> <p>"What?" I asked, "not more?"</p> <p>"What does your father think about you?" she said.</p> <p>"His father?" I questioned, my mind racing. "Did he?"</p> <p>"Maybe," she paused. "But I doubt it."</p> <p>"What did your father like?" I asked, trying to be direct as possible.</p> <p>"That your father will say yes," she stated very honestly. "You'll be too young to accept your decision."</p> <p>"Did your father agree," I asked.</p> <p>"He was only a man," she answered. "That was the idea. Even your father would say yes."</p> <p>"That is so hard to believe," I said, my voice trailing off. "I thought he loved me. Why didn't I believe him?"</p> <p>"Because he didn't love you in the same way," she replied, with a smile, placing her own glass on the bed next to mine. I reached up and touched it, watching her intently while she did so.</p> <p>The wine was warm, yet still a little bit sippy. She lowered her hand to her own wine glass and sipped at it, her head leaning up on her elbow, watching me intently.</p> <p>"Why don't you let him taste you," she suggested, the smile on her face becoming broader.</p> <p>I reached my own glass over mine and took a deep breath, swallowing it to hide what it tasted like. Slowly and deliberately, I reached out my hand, placing it against her cheek. I could smell the perfume of her hair and her body. I watched her as she slowly put her hand against my wrist so that it rested against the small of my back.</p> <p>"This would make a lot of difference," she said, her voice low. "How do you feel?"</p> <p>"Like I've finally come home. Like you really did," I agreed. "I like being home."</p> <p>"Is it hard to understand?" she asked, her hand continuing to caress my back. Her smile was still very much on her face and as she placed her head next to mine with her face buried in my neck. "What do you think?"</p> <p>"That is not what I'm thinking," I explained. "I'm very happy that you were able to let someone experience all that lust and passion. I wish that I had made the decision to let you experience your own sexual desires."</p> <p>Her mouth moved against the side of my neck and I turned the other way, turning my head from side to side to hide what had been said.</p> <p>"Maybe you couldn't have cared even if I had not." She breathed me out slowly and it was a soft sound which came from my heart. "Maybe I could have felt things a lot easier when I had decided to take a woman for myself to play out my fantasies."</p> <p>I felt a light touch on my head, gently pushing on it.</p> <p>"I think you are a very sexy girl," I said, turning my head to the side, still holding my wine in one hand.</p> <p>"I like you," she said softly.
