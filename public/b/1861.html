"After everything, I need a drink."</p> <p>He looked at me and I smiled back. "What did you have in mind for a vodka drink?"</p> <p>He thought about it for a few seconds then smiled. "A Vodka martini, a soda, and bourbon."</p> <p>We finished our drinks at the table and sat back down. "My name is Adam and this is my girlfriend Ann," I said. "Can I get you a refill?"</p> <p>He just smiled and said, "I'll be right back."</p> <p>"You can have a shot and drink. The drinks are on ice and the booze is chilled."</p> <p>His smile broadened and he stood up. "You're going to join me in a little celebration of being back home."</p> <p>Adam went from our table and into the restroom. I poured himself a vodka martini and sat down. It was a strange feeling to be back home after so long, especially with a person you loved and who was just starting to get back into dating. It felt nice to have a drink and go through my day like that. The thought of how much I missed being home came back as a sort of a reminder. I started to feel a little dizzy and tried to get my bearings. It was like taking a walk down memory lane again. We had been going pretty steady and this time I took a sip of the drink and noticed it was good. It tasted as good as it smelled. I kept the glass to the side and drank the glass again. A soft buzzing started and I felt myself get light headed. I tried to look back out the window but couldn't. I felt an odd little tickle in my stomach and my eyes opened up to see that everything around me was getting dark. Suddenly I heard a strange car door close and he was gone. Damn I didn't want to leave the house with him.</p> <p>I tried opening my eyes again but everything was blurry. I looked to the side and saw Adam's car in the garage. I looked back towards him and saw him still standing there drinking from his glass. The moon was starting to dip out and I noticed we were sitting on the loveseat again. He smiled at me and I blushed when he looked at me. "Hi", he said "I'm Dan. How've you been?"</p> <p>"Fine," I said nervously.</p> <p>He took a couple deep swigs of the drink then looked up at me. "This isn't so bad. Where are you headed the others?"</p> <p>"I'm heading to the hotel. I think I'm a little drunk," I said. "Can I get you anything?"</p> <p>"No thanks," he replied "I'll be fine. What was all that talk about going back home?"</p> <p>"Come on!" I said "We can talk about that later now."</p> <p>I gave him my hand but he said, "Let's go back to the party and get out of this stuffy house and forget about all the boring conversation. What do you want to drink?"</p> <p>I reached in and pulled out a vodka soda out of the fridge, a gin and tonic and then a glass of bourbon. The drinks looked nice but didn't really help me with the partying. He leaned over and gave me a big kiss. "It's really good to see you", he said as he handed me the glass of bourbon.</p> <p>We sat for a bit in silence as we tried taking in the stars. Then I said to him, "You said you had to go back home to see your fiancée for a while."</p> <p>"I didn't want to go," he replied "but she is kind of going to be too busy for him to see her for a few days."</p> <p>In a very matter-of-fact tone I said, "Why didn't you get back home to have dinner with her?"</p> <p>He looked as if he wanted to tell me something but hesitated. "That's hard to do without you there", he replied "She will understand."</p> <p>He just smiled and said that it was ok. "Ok, I'll go," I said.</p> <p>I gave him a look and then got up to get his drink. Again he looked so damn sexy coming over to me as I was pouring half of his drink for him. I noticed he was looking at my chest and down towards my legs. "What are you looking at? You look beautiful."</p> <p>I just laughed and replied "Are you trying to get me drunk?"</p> <p>"Of course not" and he laughed as well.</p> <p>We sipped our drinks, drank each another drink then sat back down. It was an awkward moment as he looked me up and down, trying to assess what size of woman I was in relation to my build and how big I was—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
