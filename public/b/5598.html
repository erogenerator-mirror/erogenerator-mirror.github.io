I whispered.</p> <p>"I think I do too." She said.</p> <p>I lifted her onto the couch again and we kissed. This is new to both of us and feeling her with me excited me. I slid down her body kissing as I went, kissing her throat, her collarbone, her nipples, her tits. Then I moved down, my tongue exploring the insides of her tits. I suckled one while my fingers continued exploring inside of her pussy, finding her clit and pressing gently. She was already hot and wet as my tongue worked her clit. I continued to do that until she was breathing in little gasps and moaning, and then I moved on to licking and sucking her sweet tasting pussy. I had her squirm more, but I didn't stop, nor stop there. I kept on, teasing and fucking her with my tongue. Her head was bouncing off the couch with each lick. The sound of her moans and her whined turned me on more and I continued to lick her until I could feel her tremble with a big orgasm.</p> <p>We lay there looking at each other for nearly half an hour, neither of us wanting to move. Finally we got up and dressed, and kissed again before heading for the bedroom. My wife lay on the bed and I climbed on in front of her. We kissed for about twenty seconds. There was a pause between ourselves that got followed with an excited and lustful look. Then we began kissing again and caressing each other. We rolled around together again, until we were on our sides and holding each other. I was pressing her back, sliding my hand between her legs, rubbing her clit and sliding a finger inside her hot wet pussy. I loved the feel of her wetness against my fingers, especially the taste of her sweet juices, which only enhanced the feeling. I slid a finger inside her, slowly and moved it around as I moved it in and out. I was amazed and turned on by the thought that my tongue and fingers could be anything more. She lay back against me as I kept on doing this thing. I put my tongue down on her cunt again and licked her, paying attention to her clit. While I was doing this she began moving her hips a little, and I could see her clit harden right under my tongue. She was pushing her body against me and it was just a moment. I had seen the look in her eyes when she looked down at me; she was cumming again. I licked her again and then she grabbed my head, pushing me away gently. I was sitting up and she had this look of hunger and lust in her eyes. She had to have what I had to give and that was what I wanted.</p> <p>We kissed again. "Are you ready to take our relationship to new heights with those kisses?"</p> <p>"You know I'm definitely ready," she panted.</p> <p>"Then I can do what I would like." She replied.</p> <p>"Goodâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
