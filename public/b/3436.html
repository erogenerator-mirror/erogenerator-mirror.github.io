Here I am on holiday, about to go away. But I can't stop thinking about it. I know that I am attractive but this was not only a chance encounter but a real good experience. Just looking at her made me feel all tingly inside. She was so beautiful and I felt like I could take all night if I wanted. I knew I would never do it but I just can't do it. I feel as if I do not want to but I can't shake the idea of taking something as personal as her in another way.</p> <p>We are standing next to each other. She turns me in the air and then kisses me again. It seems as if she is ready to get on with the holiday but I could not help myself from responding by slipping my hand down from the table and between her legs. We were standing there holding hands holding each other's hands. I look her in the eye and kiss her. I then reach down to put my hand on her leg, feeling the skin of her inner thigh. It feels different to rub myself. She pulls away from me again and looks at me in the eye. I look back at the paper copy. She is still looking at me. I take the paper in my hand and start leafing through it. I don't know when her eyes stop on me. It felt like time stopped.</p> <p>When I look up at her she smiles and asks "How is it?" I look back at the paper.</p> <p>"I don't know if I should answer or if we should leave now."</p> <p>"But we are in the country. There is no-one outside the door to hear us."</p> <p>This question is making me feel guilty. She is standing in the doorway of the door wearing a very sexy outfit. I just had to ask her how to act so she wouldn't answer me. I think she can tell I was trying to keep things at the moment from my mind.</p> <p>"Would you stop that right now?" she asks.</p> <p>"No. Stop thinking." I look at her again and she smiles again. I pull a book off the shelf and continue leafing.</p> <p>She turns away from me and takes my hand on the way to the door. Once there she stops me.</p> <p>"I want you inside of me right now," she says breathlessly. "Put me down."</p> <p>She takes my hand and lays me down on the bed. She quickly puts her clothes over me. I look down at hers which she is wearing.</p> <p>"I do like it," she says. "You make me feel warm."</p> <p>"What is it you would like me to do while we are here?" she asks.</p> <p>"You'll see," I say. "But it is best then."</p> <p>"You already told me you had a boyfriend", she says, giving me another look at her beautiful tits. She continues to sit there on the bed and looking at me while she continues to play with my body. Then she turns on the lamp on the night stand next to the bed.</p> <p>"Why don't you move your knees for me", she says with a big smile.</p> <p>"Why don't you lie down on the bed and let me do that for you?" she asks.</p> <p>I lie down on the bed and she kneels on the floor with her legs open. She is a beautiful sight. She is so pretty. I can't help myself but look at her while she plays with my body some more.</p> <p>"Take off your shirt".</p> <p>She takes off her shirt and lays it on top of my jeans.</p> <p>"Take your shoes off," she says.</p> <p>"No-no clothes", I say.</p> <p>"No! Let me see you", she says.</p> <p>She takes off her shorts first, letting them fall to the floor. She starts to take off her bra, not that she really thinks it was necessary, but I can tell by the look on her face that it is very important for her to get naked first. Once she goes off the bra she takes it and throws it onto the bed. She has a nice tight bottom that I am dying to touch. I try to imagine what would it feel like in my hand. I can see the outline of her labia with a clear focus from where I am kneeling. My hand moves in slow motion over her skin. I have never been so turned on before.</p> <p>She takes her shirt off and I take off my clothes, too. Once I am completely undressed she looks at me.</p> <p>"I have got to have you now", she says.</p> <p>I turn around and take a step back and hold her in my arms. We kiss. I caress her hair and her neck and sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
