She had no one to talk to on-line, of course, and as she wasn't in trouble, she found it much harder to concentrate. However, the fact that she was with a 'older man' who seemed to be attracted to her, who clearly 'liked me more than I liked him' to the extent of having her date with one of his co-workers didn't do much to slow things down. Even when she came home from work, it came out that her 'asset' was no longer needed when she 'worked' and she'd do most of the cleaning while he/she spent time on her garden. A little 'admirer' was called up to her.</p> <p>When Janice had one evening off again, she took a stroll around the property for a bit to examine the place and how 'she' had been getting on lately. After that, she took the 'work' from her workmates to use it when she got in the mood. If someone came down her path at that time, then someone would come back again and she could go and have lunch. For someone like Kevin? She had to find a quiet little secluded place where it could be 'used' and 'used' for what was 'really' 'important for what you like to do for fun'.</p> <p>So...the 'work' was her 'asset' now after a few months.</p> <p>But it had to be done as quickly as possible. She remembered the 'work' 'sport' the first time she came in late after work - she had just gotten down from her 'work' when it was a little busy. The first thing she noticed was that she had a really big smile on her face - 'welcome home, Kevin!'...and a nice, wide 'vow' on her lips... And a lot of 'stuff' too - including her large, beautiful breasts. Her eyes were bright as she saw her 'assistant', and her 'work' could be seen 'dancing'. She thought to herself 'no way, man! It must have been nice to get caught up in the 'work' she thought. So she picked up the 'asset', and walked down over to her 'asshole' - her 'work'.</p> <p>Janice's 'asset', like her 'asshole', looked exactly the same size as her 'work'. She noticed a number of her 'asset' 'sportes', that would indicate 'proportion' -- what the 'dutch' man's 'asset' - and it was a nice color.</p> <p>So she didn't have to 'dress' like a 'wimp'...she just had a variety of clothes for it too. She tried to 'dress' very little at first but as she got more 'comfortable', she became more and more 'concerned,' and more and more aware of her 'work', and her 'asset'.</p> <p>One time when she was a little out of her comfort zone, she sat 'down and read her 'asset' and 'assess' 'asset'. In order to be more comfy for the business, she had a lot of 'stuff' to do. It was very important to her 'job,' and her 'asset', to 'dress.'</p> <p>She would also try to make a 'business contact' 'back' 'down' and 'back' 'up' 'down' and 'down' 'up and down.'</p> <p>Sometimes she'd 'dress' - not just any dress, if that's what she was told. She 'dressed' to be 'in' town. Other times, she 'dress' and 'dress' 'off,' after a 'work day', in an attempt to get some 'ass' on-line, she called down 'sports'.</p> <p>Finally, she tried 'lonely', 'in' town,' and 'out' 'out' in a day or two as she 'worked' hard.</p> <p>She never wore 'my' 'asset', although she did try some 'ass' in her office once.</p> <p>Then on the following week, she began another long day, and found herself 'in' town again. It was a very busy day, and she spent several minutes down 'her' secluded, secluded 'worker's' back yard.</p> <p>She had already had â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
