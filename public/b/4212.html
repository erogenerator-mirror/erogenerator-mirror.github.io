That may be what happened, but that's not what I'm trying to say here. That I have no excuse for my actions."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, Jake. I was just worried about you. When we started talking, it was almost like we were talking about you. So I guess it's not surprising if you feel the same way about me."</p> <p>"I think that's a good thing."</p> <p>"Yeah. You're not the only one."</p> <p>"Thank you, Jake, I think this is going to be a good day. It's been really strange since we talked to you."</p> <p>"You made it even more interesting?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess I did."</p> <p>****</p> <p>I pulled back from our date to look over her shoulder. She was watching me intently as we walked back toward our table.</p> <p>"Is everything clear?"</p> <p>"Yes, just like it was during the break so to speak. Everything is clear, including you."</p> <p>"And you're okay?"</p> <p>"Everything's okay... and there's really nothing to worry about, I'm sure. Are you and I going to be friends?"</p> <p>He leaned over to me. I could feel the heat of his hand on me.</p> <p>"I think so. I mean, I do feel a little weird about it, but yeah, we're friends."</p> <p>She sat quietly in front of him for a few minutes, looking a little bit pensive. She pulled the two napkins out from her purse, and gently wiped me off with it. As she did, I felt a jolt go through my body. Just as I did, I felt the beginnings of an erection that threatened to push it right through the fabric of my pants.</p> <p>I looked over to her, hoping she would smile at it, but she didn't.</p> <p>"So what're you going to do?"</p> <p>"I thought we'd start by calling a cab."</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"I can't pay the driver, but it would be a decent tip anyway."</p> <p>"So there are no other options?"</p> <p>"There's just too many things with you. And besides, if you're going to stay with me, I'd be inclined to consider it right."</p> <p>"Do you have to?"</p> <p>"No. I have to. You're going to be mine just like I planned, no questions asked. It's the closest thing to what you already are. If we had a chance to get away from here before your first date, if it didn't cause your problems, we can go again."</p> <p>"I'm willing, I'll do whatever you say."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>I turned back to her and continued taking notes.</p> <p>"We talked. You didn't fight with me at all. I think I understand. Let's see, you've been through a lot together, so I would think you did something. There was a lot to talk about. I really think you and I can get along better now."</p> <p>"Yeah. I mean it. You've already talked a lot about it. Let's just cut to the chase."</p> <p>I let my arm slip from around her shoulders. The feeling was amazing.</p> <p>She looked down at me.</p> <p>"This isn't going to be easy, so that's not going to happen if we don't make any decisions fast right away."</p> <p>"Okay. Can we go home tomorrow?"</p> <p>"Why? I thought you were going to the museum?"</p> <p>"Why'd you think that? There are some nice things you could do there. I have an art collection."</p> <p>"But I'll have to pay for that."</p> <p>She smiled.</p> <p>"Well, it's a date. I'll drive. I've got work to do, and the cab won't be here till tomorrow morning."</p> <p>"That's nice of you, but we better get going. That's going to take forever."</p> <p>"That'll be fine, we can do it by my car."</p> <p>"Okay, let's go."</p> <p>The cab driver waved as we got in.</p> <p>"Let's try again."</p> <p>****</p> <p>I pulled over to the side of the road when I saw him. She looked surprised that I wasn't pulling away, but that she hadn't expected me to be this quick about it. We got out and walked toward his truck, both getting a good look at it.</p> <p>I had a quick look around to make sure the other cab wasn't there.
