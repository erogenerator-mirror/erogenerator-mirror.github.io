I dunno. Is all that going to be just that, I mean, is it going to be just that, or what?"</p> <p>"Well, I don't know, I guess... I guess we'll find out. If it's like that I might actually really be doing it."</p> <p>I just stared at her, a little incredulous that, I mean, if it's what she was doing, I must really be a pervert for not just wanting to know what the real deal is!</p> <p>"Well, like I said, don't do it."</p> <p>She got really red now, and I mean really really red, and kind of giggled too, but then got quiet. I didn't know what to say or what to think. I guess she knew it wasn't going on, and so she just sort of let it go.</p> <p>"I guess I'll just have to think it through."</p> <p>And I did think it through, but I didn't really ask her how or what, really, I was going to ask again. Just that, and just think the idea of doing that, in our house, in our marriage, or whatever it would probably be like.</p> <p>"That's great, we don't have to do stuff like that." I said.</p> <p>"Yeah, I know."</p> <p>"I guess I really do need to, you know, to figure out which thing that's going on with the other one, because I mean, I kind of have feelings like that for you, too."</p> <p>"And you love me, right?"</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>"Well, what we're doing here, and what I have with your husband, doesn't really feel like you're doing anything with him, or anything. It's just going to be different."</p> <p>"Huh?" she asked, kind of surprised.</p> <p>"Well, the way I feel right now, I want this to work for one reason, for the other, but mostly for your husband. Is that okay, baby?"</p> <p>"I guess." She said, and then, and only then and really with me, "This is great. We should do it again soon, maybe. Just to see if it really does work for you."</p> <p>"Baby, will you let me give you a little more? You know I'm still trying to figure this thing out."I said with a smile.</p> <p>"Mmm, sure, I suppose I will."</p> <p>And then she said with a smile, "And so do we, I mean!"</p> <p>*</p> <p>It was on Saturday morning. We were both up, we got both breakfast, but only so it would be okay, but we also got to talk about how we'd have a great sex and let her decide to do it with me, if she decided that's better, and she did, and we talked about it and we had a great good, and there was even more to see, but I still got to think about how good she would make me feel.</p> <p>And then, just as I was thinking things out, just as we both had been thinking and talking to each other, and with each other, I finally got up the courage to ask her what she was thinking about.</p> <p>"Do I love you?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Yes, I think so," she said.</p> <p>"So, tell me then." And I wanted to know.</p> <p>"Yes, and I think we both, if you will, would like to have sex with each other, if you did with me."</p> <p>"I'll do that, I mean, I guess so, but... and it is really... so great."</p> <p>We talked a little more as we brought food to the table, and then our conversation turned to how I'd feel about it. We talked for a long time, I think we got through it all. It just was an endless conversation.</p> <p>I didn't mind hearing from her in person, and hearing her tell me how much she loved me just as much as she loved to tell me how much she really loved me, and I knew that, like how I knew for sure that she loved me because I knew so, but it also helped us know that our loving was still more than just sexual or just some sort of physical attraction as we're still learning to live together, and what about you, was going on between you?</p> <p>And I knew that the way she'd told me about being with you was her way of telling me, so I did ask about yours. "I do have it with you, too," I said. "How about with you as well?"</p> <p>"That's very nice."</p> <p>"It's nothing like that.
