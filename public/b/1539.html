"I want to see you scream as loud as you want for as long as you can until you stop fighting me." She took his fingers out of her pussy and pushed a finger into her mouth as she turned around.</p> <p>"I think I need to ask you something," he said.</p> <p>"Sure! What's it?" she said. She kissed him hungrily before getting down on all fours on the floor. She looked back at him over her shoulder, her hair brushing against her ass.</p> <p>"You want to play on?"</p> <p>"If it's okay with you, I mean!" she said. "Would you like me to do this?"</p> <p>Steve looked up into her eyes, and she looked back at him, eyes questioning. He nodded and she smiled back, looking back down. His jaw dropped. Slowly her eyes took in the rest of his body. She saw that the bulge in his pants was making him tingle and she turned back to kneel. She looked up at him and grinned, running one hand up his belly, stopping by his shirt. Her other hand reached into his pants, which still hadn't completely come off. He lifted his hips towards her as she pulled down his pants. The head of his cock poked out between his boxers. It was almost like it was there. She could feel it through the thin fabric even through the jeans.</p> <p>"God, those pants are a bit tight for me," Steve said. She grabbed them with one hand as she opened his pants. Her hand felt heavy on it, holding it while she tugged the pants down over his member. Finally his boxers came to the point where they had to go all the way down to his ankles. She knelt there staring at his manhood. Her hands gently rubbed the length and girth of it as she stared at it. Her mouth was watering just looking at it. She looked back up at him again and he was smiling. He didn't stop smiling.</p> <p>"You can keep this," she said and reached up to feel it with her other hand. It wasn't as thick as Steve's, but it was almost twice as long. It wasn't too thick, but it was thick enough that it looked as though it were going to tear her in half. Steve couldn't really see how she got there, but he knew the sensation as she gently ran her fingers over his length. Her fingers were wrapped around his shaft and it was just the right length for her to wrap her fingers around. As she was doing this, she had her hands on her knees and she was staring up at him and smiling again. She smiled back at him, her lips parted as she bit her bottom lip.</p> <p>His hand came up over her as she kept her gaze staring up at him, looking up at his smiling face. He grabbed her hips and pulled them towards him. She leaned in as he positioned his cock between her legs. She didn't think she could even wrap her fingers around this thing. It was just so long, compared to Steve, although she thought it was around the midway point. They stood there watching each other, Steve gently rubbing her ass cheeks, gently rubbing the top and sides of her pussy. She was moaning now, feeling his fingers in her pussy. She pushed back against his hands, feeling the friction between her hands and Steve's tip.</p> <p>Steve reached over and pulled her over to the front of him and pulled her closer against himself. He kissed her as his tongue entered her mouth, pushing her against him. He brought her hands up to rest on his head as he took her into his body. He felt her hands pull his hair into her mouth and he pulled on it gently as she moaned into his mouth, her body tightening again as he entered her.</p> <p>He grabbed her hips and pushed himself as deeply into her as he could. He heard her breathing get harsher as she began to moan louder and begin to rock back against him. She let out a loud moan as her back arched and she pressed harder onto his tip as his lips left her mouth to go on to her neck. He took her throat in his fingers as he pushed her chest towards him as he kissed her. She began to scream his name before she pushed back onto him.</p> <p>She was still moaning as she pushed away from him. She reached out and placed her hands on the small of her back, pulling herself up and away from his body. His lips covered hers as they both moaned, her hands moving down back towards her ass. He broke the kiss, breathing heavily as he looked into her eyes. She looked back up at him, biting her bottom lip as she rubbed her ass against his groin and began to circle the tip of his penis with her fingers. She looked back at him again and grinned as she felt him beginâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
