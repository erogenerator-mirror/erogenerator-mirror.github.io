I'm sorry about that. I'm so sorry. I don't want to do that again... I'll think about it in the morning as long as I can."</p> <p>"Yes, you can, Chris. Just give me a minute to clean up and call me and I'll go to bed."</p> <p>They lay in each others arms for the longest time. They were both exhausted from their exertions. Chris's had turned to a dark purple shade of blue as he laid there with his eyes closed in complete relaxation, his cock still standing proudly at full height. She slid one arm down across his chest and gently kissed first his nipple, then the side of his neck and ear, then his chin. She felt him move and her hand moved back toward his cock, pulling him to his feet to stand there between her legs.</p> <p>"I love you, Chris. I'll see you again tomorrow."</p> <p>After a light kiss, the two lovers walked hand in hand on unsteady legs back to their bedroom where they lay on top, cuddling each other in bed.</p> <p>"I love you!" She told him in the dark.</p> <p>The next morning he showered and dressed and she went to the kitchen to grab another cup of coffee. As she came back in she could see he was still fast asleep. She smiled. He had a very content look on his face, one of those days when you can have the whole world to yourself when you are in that mood. She made a toast in her own little cup and a cup of coffee and he just stood there and drank it.</p> <p>It was an absolutely delightful day. They spent it in nothing but the warm loving embrace they had been exchanging after their lovemaking. Finally they slept naked in each other's arms, each having a very contented look on their faces. Chris looked so contently in her eyes she felt a special connection to her beloved.</p> <p>They awoke early, having gone shopping that morning. She had a couple of more bags of clothes to put back where they had left them and they drove back to his place to pick them up. After about ten minutes he had a very light breakfast and they went over to start her dinner.</p> <p>Chris had cooked the salad yesterday, which he had sliced and was mixing up. It really was fantastic! The veggies were perfectly seasoned and as he sat eating he looked at her.</p> <p>"I didn't realize how much you liked to watch people having so much fun and not worry about being judged. Not that I don't love you for that, but I do feel like it sometimes needs some adjustment."</p> <p>"You have no idea," she replied. "I love it. I have to agree with your assessment."</p> <p>They sat talking in the family room sipping their coffee. He said he hadn't realized how the dinner had gone since the beginning of their relationship. They were both amazed by their relationship, and he knew he could share all of their lives.</p> <p>"We didn't even think of how it would turn out," she said. "We were both surprised and just accepted what we felt we meant when we were trying to have as much fun as possible."</p> <p>"Oh Chris, I'm so glad!" She said and leaned over to kiss him. It was so soft and gentle, like they had been lovers forever. She could feel the desire rising inside her, and knew she couldn't deny him just a few moments longer.</p> <p>She broke their embrace and moved over to the end table where she took his hand and said. "I have a surprise for you if you'll let me."</p> <p>"If you really can't make it, that's okay. I'm starving!"</p> <p>"Just one more, please."</p> <p>She sat beside him on the sofa, and kissed him. He could smell her, her perfume... she had a sweet smell. He put his arm around her as she snuggled into his chest and said.</p> <p>"I love you so much!"</p> <p>She got up and stood, turning around to face the door. She leaned her head forward and said. "See you tomorrow Chris. Just the two of us."</p> <p>Chris looked toward the door and heard her speak.</p> <p>"It's almost time, Chris," she said. "I'm going to go take a bath, then go to bed."</p> <p>Chris followed her in to the bathroom and she turned on the hot water as she asked if he would like a glass of morning tea?</p> <p>He smiled and said. "Sounds great. But where does your surprise come in?"</p> <p>"I thought itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
