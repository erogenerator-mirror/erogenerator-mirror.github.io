Not that first year of freshman year just didn't fit the way it did.</p> <p>"Well, I guess it does," I lied.</p> <p>The next day she asked me to give her a massage, and as I looked down at her, the look on my face let me know that she knew the truth. She smiled and walked over, wrapped her arms around my waist, and kissed me softly on the lips.</p> <p>"You're beautiful," I said and it was the truth.</p> <p>With this closeness, we fell onto the massage table, which I laid on the floor, as she lay her head on my lap.</p> <p>"I want to give you a special treat," she whispered.</p> <p>With that, she slid the robe off my shoulders and it fell to the floor, revealing my tanned torso and hard chest.</p> <p>"Your skin is so incredible. I want to have a long time before I can do this."</p> <p>"Me, too," I said with a smile.</p> <p>"Can we?" she asked.</p> <p>With that I stood up, and we looked each other in the eye, and I began to slowly unbutton the shorts that she was to join me in. We pulled each other's clothes off, and she stood nude in front of me, her hips swaying gently, her hair cascading over her shoulders and down her back, while I gently caressed her face and chest.</p> <p>"Oh, God, you feel so good," she replied.</p> <p>"You look so gorgeous," I whispered.</p> <p>"I know, I know. But you must have felt the same way. Do you really really want me?"</p> <p>"Yes," I breathed. It was a confession, but at the same time, feeling her body moving next to mine in the room that was just a few floor below the table set me at a new level of excitement.</p> <p>"Do you want to do this now?"</p> <p>"Yes, now," I whispered, knowing from this point that we were both nervous, and not very sure at first. To this I could only agree.</p> <p>We lay down together on the massage table again. It was cold, and my naked body felt cool against her warm skin. She kissed a path from my lips down my chin to my neck, her mouth sucking on it and then kissing her way up the middle of my chest. Her hands were already on my chest, and she was gently massaging my already stiff nipples.</p> <p>"I have been waiting for this for so long," she smiled in the darkness.</p> <p>We kissed gently, our tongues touching each others and caressing each others in a way to a deep and passionate passion. She moaned, and I moaned in the darkness as well, our mouths moving over each other's lips, her tongue licking my mouth, and then probing mine.</p> <p>"How long is a while?" she asked, breathless.</p> <p>"It's a while," I whispered.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes, I'm sure," I replied.</p> <p>"Ok, then lay back and enjoy," she ordered.</p> <p>She stood next to the table, and I lay down on it.</p> <p>She straddled me and kissed her way up my stomach, leaving light little kisses on my chest. Her naked breasts brushed my thighs, and I moaned as I felt one at my lips and her hard nipple poke against my skin.</p> <p>"That feels so good," I told her.</p> <p>She didn't need any encouragement. Her right hand slid down my stomach until it was resting on my hard cock. My hips thrust involuntarily, pushing her fingers back and forth against it. Her hand felt so good, and she was the expert massage-maker so many other women in my life had been.</p> <p>She was still sitting on my lap, and her lips just inches from my cock when it became apparent to me that she wanted to continue.</p> <p>I could see her pussy right before my eyes, and this time was no different. Our eyes were locked together on my hard cock, and I felt her moist pussy lips on the head as she lifted herself up and down, rubbing her clit with my cock. My hands, still on her breasts, moved over to her hips and held her, moving her down. We lay facing each other, and our bodies began to rock as we rubbed each others genitals in sync, rubbing and stroking, trying to bring us the ultimate release.</p> <p>"I want this to last," she whispered.</p> <p>We began to go at it again, and thisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
