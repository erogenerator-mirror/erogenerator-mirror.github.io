He knew he wasn't too good with women, so he kept it short. But just in case, there was lots of talk about women in the same way. And it was pretty obvious what he meant. Then they met up another hot tub and had a fun time.</p> <p>He had a couple of more beers as he watched her get laid while he was getting a beer. She said, "So, you got laid tonight? Or did you just have your fun, like at my house?" He told her, "You were the hottest thing to go in the pool." He went inside and watched her for a bit, feeling the wetness of her crotch. She had the kind of look that would have made any man jealous, and it made his cock swell. He told her, "So you guys have been here a while now, so do you want to tell me more about the hot tub conversation?"</p> <p>She laughed, and said, "Come on, don't be mean, I can't tell if you're serious or not. You know how it goes when you have the girl in your bed, now I'm just the horny guy, OK? Let's just talk."</p> <p>He was a bit more aggressive with the rest of the time, because she seemed to be so nice and sweet to him. But she didn't want him to get upset with her as she always seemed to be with guys. She started talking about how the hot tub was turning her on (and, she said, "It also makes you horny and it's no different because you got it, "), and how they always were able to get a great view of her when she went to the same place with them when they came down. She was always showing off and making them even more horny. She would tell if they were going too far now, and that she wanted to be naked and let them touch her all over. She wasn't shy around it though, he could see right in her eyes she was horny so she wouldn't resist him.</p> <p>Once when they were in the corner of the hot tub she asked him, "Do you think this is a good idea? And is it worth going back to my place?"</p> <p>She was surprised that he was so forthright with her, and he started laughing so hard that her face actually got wet. He said, "No, I'm not like that, I'm not like that at all. It's just like you've got to do everything for yourself and then come back to me, like this, with me. And I get a free ride home tonight. It's just like you said. And since you like me all that much, I guess it's all right to take your clothes off and join us. I wouldn't worry in case you get cold."</p> <p>She said, "OK! But I really want to do this." She was really starting to feel the heat and wetness of those things, which was a wonderful combination. She started taking off her little bikini top, and he reached down and pulled it off her arms completely. He pulled her up to him, and she was so wet. He then pulled her around so that she was facing him, and with one leg on each side of him he raised them above his head as she moved them back and forth, her bare tits now hanging on either side of him. She could feel the fullness of him now, and he was so thick that with a little help he could be even more than she could have hoped for. She leaned forward for a bit, and then just moved her hands to the sides of his head, guiding his hands to her breasts as he began licking and suckling and nibbling on the nipples.</p> <p>She leaned forward again, and when their bodies were close enough that she could reach him from up this way she grabbed his erection and led him by it into one of the side beds. When her arms went around his neck she had him all the way in her mouth, and he grabbed her hips as they started pumping their hips together. She couldn't do it, she had to be inside her, but that was all she could do. His cock seemed to grow even more and she felt the veins in his shaft as they got into her, and as they both felt her mouth getting wetter and her lips started to cling to his cock, her hand dropped down and started to jerk and squeeze his balls.</p> <p>She wanted to get off so bad, all she could do was moan and moan. As she was saying, "Oh, Oh, Oh," she had an orgasm, and he did too, feeling her vagina spasm and grip his cock as he was pushing into her, his cock spurting cum deep in her mouth. They both moaned their pleasure and as soon as he was done he pulled her off him, andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
