"You could be a doctor. I could get a doctor if I didn't like your sex."</p> <p>"You wouldn't want doctor to be my doctor," I say.</p> <p>"Oh yes, I would, as long as I got him nice and horny."</p> <p>I'm wondering if she will suck my dick for me today. Not that I wasn't hornier than I was today, at least compared to today, I'll admit it, and the thought doesn't do it for me at all. I wonder if she really would let me fuck her again tonight. Then I know that I wouldn't even like it, let alone let it happen, let alone have sex with a beautiful woman again. Maybe that'd be fun. Maybe it wasn't fun. Maybe she wants it to happen again. Maybe I wanted it to happen again. What am I thinking?</p> <p>So I'm hoping she doesn't want to suck my dick again tonight. She just wants me to jack off in the shower. Maybe she is sucking her boyfriend's dick instead.</p> <p>I hear her going to bed.</p> <p>The next time I see her, she doesn't want to look at me because she wants to see me nude. She goes to bed naked and leaves me to jack off in my own room. I've never seen her nude before. Maybe after fucking someone, she'll decide that she wants to have sex again.</p> <p>I start the shower now and walk in as if I didn't see her. I start the water and she says, "It's not going to take that long to get out."</p> <p>I start in and get into the shower. I'm just taking my time with her. I just keep thinking about the blowjob that she gave me tonight. Maybe I'll let her suck my dick again and we'll just skip it. If I can just get her horny again, I'll wait until tomorrow to jack off, though. I just hold her naked in my arms, kissing her. I hold her and we kiss, a long, tender kiss.</p> <p>After a long, nice, gentle kiss and a little fondling of her body, I let her go.</p> <p>I do it again, this time in the shower. She is going to get turned on again but I don't mind. There's still something so strange about her mouth on my dick. I start to feel a little uncomfortable with all this, but I think that it's more exciting to be with a stranger.</p> <p>I don't mind the mouth on my dick. I love the way she licks my dick with her lips. She's not doing it too hard, she's making me want her.</p> <p>She's giving me head.</p> <p>I turn the shower on, take my shower gel and start to lather her up from head to toe. I'm trying to wash her with the water. While I run my soapy hands over her beautiful body, feeling her skin, her breasts, her ass, her legs, my hands feel more alluring and exciting. They feel more sexy than she ever does, even after fucking her and I know she's not a virgin anymore. Maybe she really is a virgin as she never had any sex in her life, other than just blowjobs. Maybe I'm doing this in a porn movie theater or something, to get a feel for her. I've never felt this way about anyone. The way she looks at me and smiles. She's sexy as hell. It's weird not to feel like this with her. But I feel weird too. More strange than ever before.</p> <p>"What's your name?"</p> <p>"Am I Ami," she says. "I'm Ami."</p> <p>"I'm Joe," I say feeling somewhat sheepish. "How about you Ami?"</p> <p>Just as I am, she's getting turned on again. "Ami," she says. "Can you come get me, Joe? I don't know what I want to do."</p> <p>"Sure Ami, I'll do it with Joe." And I really don't mind. We should keep going this way for her. In fact, I think we should do this more. That way she feels comfortable again.</p> <p>I grab the gel and start to wash her. I wash her back and her sides, all the way down. When I'm done, she's smiling and getting horny again. I think we have a pretty good chance at going to bed. I'll just be out of the shower a while then. Now I'm going to let her feel my dick again.</p> <p>As I was rubbing the gel over her body, she asks if I'll help her wash her. I agree that we can wash that off if it'll help.
