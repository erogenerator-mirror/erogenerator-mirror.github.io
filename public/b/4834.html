He tried to remember his lines, the symbols. The knife was smooth and sharp, the cut was smooth and quick. With her mouth still closed he reached to kiss her, he knew the sensation. He kissed her again, the warmth coming to him as he pressed his body to hers. He could feel his cock press to her thigh as he kissed her.</p> <p>She pushed herself back with her arms against his chest and then she pulled him forward. He slipped the knife down a small slit, the blood pooled in her belly button, and as he continued to kiss her his hand crept up her torso and cupped her breast. She moaned as his hand covered her aching nipple. He rubbed the softness between his fingers and then slid them between the softness between her legs. His finger slid effortlessly between her lips, finding her opening. Both of their hands sought to bring each other a moan from their lips and their lips.</p> <p>"I want it so much," she moaned. "Yes I want you in me, in my mouth" she continued. "Yes, my tongue in your mouth. Oh you make me so wet" she begged.</p> <p>He had to think of something else to say, and he stopped kissing her. He ran a hand through her hair and took a grip on the nape of her neck. "I have something nice for you to try," his voice was so soft, it almost made her melt and leave. He kissed her neck and she felt so hot, so alive. He pulled gently on her nubs, dragging the hard piece between her lips and she gasped at the cool touch. He smiled as she writhed in his arms.</p> <p>"No, no," she gasped in a barely audible whisper.</p> <p>"What did I do, what did I think I should do?" he replied. Her response was almost instant. Her head dropped down and she took his shaft in her mouth. The roughness of his flesh sent a shiver through her and it felt so good. She slid her lips slowly down over his length and she could feel it as if trying to go deeper, but there was no relief. She reached under with her other hand and touched his balls. They felt soft and warm, but there was an even softer, smoother texture.</p> <p>"I wanted to take them, to take them in my mouth," she whispered in his ear. It had been weeks since she had sucked him, he hadn't been able to remember. He would have to think about that, he thought as he kissed her throat. He moved one hand from her head and ran the fingers through her curls. He could see her head moving up and down. He gently squeezed and rubbed her scalp as he sucked on her neck. She moaned in his ear.</p> <p>"Do it" she breathed. "Please, give it to me. Oh please. You're making me beg."</p> <p>He slid a hand under her nightie and rubbed her nipple gently. "Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yes, yes, yes."</p> <p>He stopped, he hesitated, he had just given her a taste of what she wanted, what he had fantasized and the things he had come to enjoy. He knew that she was a sensitive person, and as far as he was concerned he was in charge of things. He kissed her as he continued. As their kisses grew more intense, the kiss became more passionate. His mouth moved to the nape of her neck. His hands slid up to cup her breasts and his lips touched the tip of her nipple. Her mouth hungrily kissed him as her hips met his with one last plunge before the two bodies had ended.</p> <p>When she felt him enter her she screamed in her mouth. He was so huge, so hard. He filled her completely and it didn't feel uncomfortable, it felt beautiful. It was as if her whole body was in the moment; she had never felt pleasure at the same time before, and she knew that she now knew what she wanted. She wanted him in her.</p> <p>She heard him groan as he ground into her. Their groans were loud, and she wondered just how loud they moaned. She tried to concentrate on the movement of her body to give him all the sensation. But she was also acutely aware of the sound of their lips smacking and her back arched as he began to go faster and faster inside. She wanted to tell him to stop, to make him stop, to do something, anything but it felt so good. She had felt the urgency building to a peak. It was almost physical as she felt the hotness spread through her body. She wanted this.</p> <p>It hurt, the stinging pain of the sharp blade. She held on to him with all her might and held his body in her arms. Her hands went aroundâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
