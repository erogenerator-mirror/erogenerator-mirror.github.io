He grinned at me, "I'm in a hurry, I want to give me my first girl for the day!"</p> <p>"OK, here it is. I want you to take your clothes off and we'll meet back here at 8:00 for lunch. If you still want me, go ahead and dress and then meet me at the corner by the elevator, I'll pick you up at 6:00."</p> <p>A few minutes later, after a last lingering kiss on my cheek and a hug, the elevator doors opened and we headed down to the lobby. This time there was no one at the reception desk. At 7:00 we both walked in to the elevator, I was a little nervous and had a brief moment of panic when we left the elevator at a small table. "OK, you can go in first. Come on, come with me."</p> <p>As we got into the elevator, I looked around and realized we had a couple more floors to go, so after a short struggle I got on the elevator and the door opened for us. As we made our way to the ground floor, I watched the guys checking out my ass and my dress. When we came to room 224, there were two guys waiting outside.</p> <p>"You're on your own, guys, you don't get in until after 9:00, and we'll let you pass." I told them and they got back in the elevator and followed me back down the corridor to the lobby.</p> <p>"Well, are you guys all set?"</p> <p>"Just go." One of the guys chimed in, "You're lucky she's on the elevator with us, otherwise you'd never get inside."</p> <p>"I'm not so sure."</p> <p>"Good for her, if she gets in before we leave, there will be a couple guys in with her."</p> <p>Just then another door opened, and both guys walked in right along with me. They walked around the corner and into the room and closed the door to the room, leaving us alone.</p> <p>"Can I get you something to drink?" I said, and he nodded. I walked over to the bar, got a Coke from the end table, and walked back to the elevator and pressed the button the three elevators had assigned to the second floor.</p> <p>After several moments I decided it was time for me to get to the restaurant and had gone into the lobby, when the elevator operator said I had 5 minutes. "Is the restaurant open?" I asked.</p> <p>"Only a couple of rooms, but it's all open up. There is a couch and a chair right behind it."</p> <p>"I've already seen the place outside, but the parking lot is so far back from the elevator, it's a little ways out."</p> <p>"You're right, we're not staying the night. Why don't we sit here, maybe a second?"</p> <p>We walked back toward the bar which was set up to serve a dozen or so tables, and the men took off their clothes. There had to be 15 guys and me, and I couldn't get into the bar without getting one of the guys a beer.</p> <p>The guys kept me at bay for a few more minutes, but I just wanted to get a good fuck before I left. As time went on, the guys got more daring, taking off their clothes as quickly as they could. Suddenly a guy took my shorts off, and I felt myself get excited again. He held my hands and led me from the bar over to the couch, where I sat down on the back with my shorts next to me.</p> <p>The guy took off my shirt and I put it on the ground. He then straddled my hips and rubbed some spit on his finger and pushed it into my ass. "Are you ready?" he asked me. I nodded and he stuck his finger in to the knuckle. He then pulled it out again and put it in my mouth. "Are you ready to get fucked?" I nodded again, then he pushed his hard cock into my pussy and began fucking me, not really pulling out before he came. The guy was going so fast there were so many cock to be put in me. I came a couple more times before he took his cock out and turned me around. I put my feet on the couch and leaned against it. He held my legs apart and began fucking me, which was a perfect fuck position. As he started coming, a guy got off the couch and pulled out his cock and gave it to his partner. At that point, as they each took a shot at my cunt, they took off their underwear to get a piece of my ass. At 7:00, we had another two drinks.</p> <p>It was 11:00 PM in the morning when we got back to the hotelâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
