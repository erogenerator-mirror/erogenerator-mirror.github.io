I was also wondering if it mattered if she had done this for anyone else. This thought was causing my pulse quicken and my pussy to go crazy and I could feel my juices running down my crack.</p> <p>"Hey baby." she said as she leaned in and kissed me on the lips. I could taste my juices on her lips and she opened her mouth wide for a moment and we shared our tongues before she said: "I am going to go take a shower."</p> <p>All I could think was it would be a great time to stop at her favorite bar, and eat some lunch and walk around a bit. I finished dressing quickly, but left for home. I could still see her from the corner of my eye though and I could see how wet my panties were making me. She asked me again how I felt, and I told her that I liked it.</p> <p>"Did you taste them in her mouth honey, I want to taste yours now."</p> <p>"What did you think I liked?"</p> <p>"I liked that you did and I would never want to lose you again."</p> <p>We were done eating and she said she wanted to go back to her place and put on some clothes which she didn't seem to be going to wear. I followed her, we walked toward her bedroom where my panties were still on their way to her door. I think we even stopped to kiss her briefly but didn't make any sexual overtures as it just felt wrong. She sat down on the edge of the bed and I started to undress and then she was on her knees in only her bra and panties. I slid them off and got a whiff of myself again, it was exciting to even smell me like that and I knew she would love me. We were both just about to go back to her bedroom when a shadow fell across us making me squirm.</p> <p>"Sorry, what is your name?" I asked, and she smiled and said it was my name. I felt a finger tracing up my leg and then across my panties before she pressed into me and rubbed it inside. She rubbed it in circles and I moaned at how intense it was. I pushed her hand away but she pushed in even more pushing my panties to the side and then up under my panties and rubbed me with just her other hand.</p> <p>"Take your panties off honey," she said.</p> <p>I turned so I could do it slowly and after the first few seconds she let it go in my panties and put it back on as we continued to kiss. Our hands explored each other as we were so intimately close together. I pulled her face to mine and kissed her deeply and when we broke our embrace I said: "Let me take them off."</p> <p>"Sure honey, lets get back to my place."</p> <p>We left her bedroom and went to her living room where my panties sat waiting for us. We returned to the living room were both already back in the thongs, but just barely. I saw both her looking at herself in her window again. One leg had her panties off the top part of the sofa and the other was still holding the panties up under the table. There was her back to her window with nothing else on. I just stood there looking at her for a second while I was wondering what to do next. She turned to me, and I saw the look in her eyes telling me she was ready for me.</p> <p>She turned back but still wore the panties I had taken off her the night before. They still looked good on her and seemed to cover her more completely so she went back to looking at herself in the mirror in front of her.</p> <p>"Honey, what do you think?"</p> <p>"Honey you look... you really look sexy. Why don't you wear your panties again? It makes me wet to see you doing it like that."</p> <p>"Do you think you would like to see me do it now, or did you want me to come home today."</p> <p>"You can't mean I want you to come home right now honey."</p> <p>"Baby you are my girl, that is part of what you can do for me right now."</p> <p>"I want you to go right now!"</p> <p>With that she ran her fingers through her pubes, ran a finger between her labia and then dipped a finger inside her. She looked at me again in the mirror and said: "I want you to take your panties off now with the next turn."</p> <p>I slowly walked to her as she was still standing facing the window looking out the windows into the night. She sat down on the sofa and spread her legs wide. I pulled her panties to her thighs and then quickly removed them. I had them on next to me by now and they only covered her lower lips leaving her pussyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
