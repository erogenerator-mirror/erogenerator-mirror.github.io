You'll get me pregnant" and she paused to look up and find my eyes. "I'm sorry! What about your job? I thought you said that you would never cheat on me!" she added.</p> <p>"I'm just a kid." I said a bit sheepishly.</p> <p>"You better be! I have my own thing!" she said as she went back over to her desk.</p> <p>"No one will be there!" I assured her.</p> <p>"I don't believe you!" she said.</p> <p>"No! I don't believe anything! Are you still seeing anyone?"</p> <p>"Yes!" she replied.</p> <p>"Oh!" was all I heard.</p> <p>"That's my sweetheart." she gave me a kiss. I had the sudden sense of guilt as I watched as her lips parted and our mouths collided. It wasn't kissing for the sex but I didn't like that. It was more just a friendly embrace. She wasn't my girl anymore. I kissed her back.</p> <p>"This is what you wanted all these years. You would give me what I wanted!" I was so happy to hear from her.</p> <p>"I am still having trouble keeping my emotions in check." I tried to put her out of my head.</p> <p>"No! You are the best lover in my life! We both know that. The fact that you would willingly give up everything just shows it too." she sounded like she was just trying to convince herself. I looked away but my eyes weren't getting the satisfaction. It was an expression that I could no longer control. I leaned my shoulder against the wall so I couldn't see the movement of my eyes.</p> <p>"I am sorry. I thought that I was the only male at my school but it doesn't matter. I just want to be with you and you are right! I'm a man now!" she took a step back and looked at me.</p> <p>"You are a beautiful young man." We laughed as she walked towards me.</p> <p>"I'm serious!" I looked at her and hugged her. Her hug had nothing to do with our feelings and we were just friends at that moment.</p> <p>"And as much as I love to hang out with you, I also love my husband." She spoke her voice was soft and she was so beautiful in my arms. She was the most perfect and desirable and desirable woman I had ever met. I felt like a teenager and she didn't even notice.</p> <p>She broke our embrace and walked towards the door. I followed her as she took the key from the lock of her office door.</p> <p>"I need to make a phone call or something."</p> <p>"No, baby. We will be back in a minute and be naked!" I didn't want to argue with her.</p> <p>I looked out the door as she walked to the door. She was looking out the front window again now. I looked down and saw a slight smile on her face as she looked at me. I turned to go back to my desk;</p> <p>"Oh! Did you just put it on?" she asked.</p> <p>"No. Did you say 'do it in his bed'. Are you serious?"</p> <p>"Yes! He had to go! I am so lucky to have a man that I could turn down every other chance at sex!" she said as she hugged her husband goodbye and walked out to her car.</p> <p>***</p> <p>"What can I do for you," I asked as we drove towards my house a couple miles ahead of a town.</p> <p>"Please don't be silly!" was all she replied.</p> <p>"Yes! It's okay! I'm sure what your going to do will be just perfect!" I tried to show her the things I'd always want to do.</p> <p>"It is a little thing! But it's so important!" She kissed me deeply.</p> <p>"And a lot of you. Just get some of those things out of your heads."</p> <p>"You know, a little bit about this 'big thing' is you haven't done it since the day you saw me at your school?"</p> <p>"No! No! Please don't talk like that. It's just something! I can help you."</p> <p>"Oh! You can help me!" she said with her hand on my thigh. I took a step back to allow her to do all the talking. I'd even been a little worried about how we looked at each other that day. She didn't seem to mind. She gave me a warm and loving smile.</p> <p>"Now I really need to work something out! I can help you with some projects."</p> <p>"Oh! What could you do? You just made me horny! I would love to help you!"</p> <p>"Well! You can helpâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
