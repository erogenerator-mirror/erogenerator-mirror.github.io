It took her a moment to recover, as the sun shone brightly on her. She was glad it was dark out, as she felt her nipples hardening against the softness of the sheet. She ran her fingers down her front, caressing her pussy lips. He had cum already, just lying there. She slid down the bed until she was kneeling over him. She smiled, thinking he felt the same. He leaned to kiss her. She slid forward, taking his swollen cock between her teeth, slowly pulling his thick shaft back into her mouth. She heard him groan. Her mouth caressed him as she slid back and forth, taking him in deeply. She held him deep, feeling him throbbing inside her. She slid her hand to his ass, pushing between his cheeks and into his crack.</p> <p>"Oh, my god, you're so fucking hot," he said, with a low growl.</p> <p>"I was afraid I was going to lose my balance," she replied, "but, I guess you were right."</p> <p>She was in charge now. She stroked him, feeling him grow even more. She slid back, and then forward again, faster and harder than before. He seemed to cum twice more, and she found herself smiling into his eyes. She couldn't believe how powerful and powerful he was, but, with every nerve ending in her body working to drive her crazy, she wanted to cum. She pulled away from him, looking down on her hand job. She saw herself in the full-length mirror on the closet door. She stood, and moved over to stand next to him. He reached up, and took her.</p> <p>"Let's give your pussy a kiss," he said in the husky, husky voice.</p> <p>"Oh yeah," she replied. She bent over, and he pushed into her. She closed her eyes, and sighed.</p> <p>"You feel so good," he said. She opened her eyes. He was taking charge again too. He felt her body go tense as her pussy squeezed inside. She felt a rush of excitement. He pushed inside her, deeper.</p> <p>"Are you okay?" he asked again, with a slow smile.</p> <p>"Mmm hmm hmmm," she replied with a soft laugh. He was so excited. He looked up toward the ceiling next to her. He kissed her, one hand on her hip, his other fondling her breasts. She moaned.</p> <p>"Now, let's get that tongue out of the way," he said. He kissed her again, and then slid off the bed, still on all fours. She pulled her legs apart, giving him room to get between them. He slowly slid forward, taking her clit between his lips once again. He slid them together, sucking and licking as he moved. She moaned. When he put her legs over his shoulder, he slid himself inside her, reaching her clit with his tongue in a hard, swirling motion.</p> <p>At last, after fucking for what seemed to her like hours, his cock was hard and throbbing inside her. She was ready to explode. He slid into her, lifting her legs up as he went, as he slid in and out of her. She let them fall forward, and felt him reach his fingers behind her hips. She wrapped her legs tightly, pulling him deep into her.</p> <p>"Oh, God, yes," she said as he entered her. He could feel what she meant as her clit started throbbing. He continued pumping into her, her pussy clasping him so tightly. He reached further, rubbing her clit with his thumb as he pushed himself hard enough inside her to stroke her G-spot. She couldn't help it. He reached around, grabbing her breasts. She grabbed him, reaching with her fingers to wrap them tightly around his shoulder. They were locked together, as he thrust and pumped into her. He could feel her body going crazy.</p> <p>"Fuck me!" she cried out, and he knew what she wanted. He reached his orgasm. "Ughhhh!" he yelled. He thrust two fingers in and out of her pussy. "Oh, god, ohhh...." he said, letting himself finish. He leaned back on his arms, exhausted and completely satisfied.</p> <p>"That was fun. But, let's never do this again," she said, with a grin.</p> <p>"Well, there are a few things we haven't tried yet." He paused, rubbing himself off, and she climbed off the bed. "I'm going to wash that sheet," she said.</p> <p>"Wait. Just for a brief moment. I didn't expect you to take so long."</p> <p>"I already knew that," she said, and he felt her head.</p> <p>"It looks like you really enjoyed getting a show," he said.</p> <p>"Hâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
