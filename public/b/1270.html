When she started to straddle his thighs, he groaned as she did.</p> <p>Karen sucked on his nipples and it sent a surge through his body, making the sensations between his legs more intense than usual,</p> <p>"Yes." He said huskily. Karen didn't tease him as she licked up to the sensitive nubs, which made him groan and push upward. Karen licked, first right then left then right, making the pleasure building between his legs radiate and intensify.</p> <p>"Ohhh!" he cried out.</p> <p>Karen sucked and nibbled softly on his nipples before she kissed the tip of his erection, just above the head. He jerked in surprise.</p> <p>"Karen!" he groaned.</p> <p>She lifted her mouth slightly off his throbbing member. "I thought you liked it," she whispered, "Do you?" She asked with a mischievous grin.</p> <p>He nodded yes, but still didn't answer her.</p> <p>"I was wondering...if I could do to your thing what your doing here," she teased. She rose up and moved over him, then moved to straddle him. She slowly lowered herself onto him as she kissed him deeply. Their kiss was like magic and every nerve in his body fired with desire.</p> <p>Mina lifted her hips from him and began a slow rocking action. He groaned as she drove him harder. The tip of his member teased her G-spot and she could feel it throb between their bodies.</p> <p>"Fuck," he groaned, "I don't think I'm ready for that yet."</p> <p>"Don't you worry," she said, "I think we're ready just as we'll ever be."</p> <p>Before he could respond, her lips left his.</p> <p>"What does that mean?" he asked.</p> <p>"Nothing," she answered immediately.</p> <p>"Come on, I know. Here," with that she slid her body up just a bit and her hips rolled forward, "I know exactly what you want."</p> <p>The passion in her voice was clear.</p> <p>Karen kissed him and her hips began to roll as her hands pulled down on his thighs to raise her body until she was sitting astride him.</p> <p>"Mmm," she murmured into his mouth. She kissed him again and he felt her body relax and part with just the tip of his penis in it.</p> <p>She stopped with just his head in her. She slid back off him and he closed his eyes just in time to see the first wave of orgasm sweep over her. Her head was lowered and he felt her muscles clenching around him and he couldn't hold back any longer. "Oh Karen," he cried out. She smiled and kissed him before riding him hard. His hands clenched hers tightly in his hands.</p> <p>"Oh, Karen," he whispered.</p> <p>After an interval in which he lost count of his orgasms, Karen rose up and sat on him again. She kissed him again and he rolled her to lie on his back with his hands on her breasts.</p> <p>"Mmm," he moaned.</p> <p>"Mmm," Karen responded with a smile. He ran his hands through her hair. He loved the feel of her silky soft body. They had kissed many times before, or more of the same if they had one, but neither of them felt safe enough to indulge their passion.</p> <p>Mina climbed off him and moved over her, facing him.</p> <p>"I want you to fuck me," she whispered.</p> <p>"I've been ready for weeks," he teased.</p> <p>He looked down at her and realized he didn't know how much longer he was going to stand the rest of his dayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
