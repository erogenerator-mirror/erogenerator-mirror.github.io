If it doesn't get my head around this, I won't be able to hold my own orgasm. I may even lose it without it."</p> <p>Her eyes went wide and she nearly panted. It took her a while for her to calm down, but when she did, she smiled and nodded. "Maybe I won't."</p> <p>He nodded too. "I don't want to spoil the surprise," he said.</p> <p>"It's all on the front," she said. "I'll just have to hope I stay in bed."</p> <p>*****</p> <p>She wasn't sure why she was standing there, but something told her she needed to go talk to someone. Then, something that felt like a warning of some kind.</p> <p>She started to walk away with him when he said, "Stay, okay?"</p> <p>She turned and was caught between him and the building she was trying to leave. She wanted so desperately to call him back to her, and for him to come back and put his arms around her and kiss her on the cheek, but she knew better. They both knew she was going to cry.</p> <p>When he said, "I'd really like you to stay like this," he pulled her to him and kissed her lips. "You look so amazing right now, and I wish I could do this to you."</p> <p>It wasn't a question. She knew she had to answer him. He'd told her that he wanted to kiss her so badly and she'd been disappointed when she wouldn't feel the same. But the question was whether she wanted him. When he reached up and pulled her to him, she couldn't help but kiss him with her eyes. She felt that way. They were just kissing. It was like the first kiss of the day, and the first time a lot of the feelings they'd had for each other had dissipated.</p> <p>As he pushed her back onto the couch, she looked down at him in amazement, and his eyes told her that he was really thinking about something. When they sat down again, he looked at her with his big, deep-blue eyes and said, "I want to taste you..."</p> <p>She looked deep into his eyes and could tell by the way he was looking at her that whatever was said in his mind that he wanted to do it.</p> <p>A tingling in her stomach told her something else was happening. It could be possible he was feeling guilty or he was feeling aroused or even worse. It couldn't be, she was sure. But when he pushed her skirt up and saw that her legs were parted and he wanted to taste her, she felt she could do anything to him. She felt the same way.</p> <p>"How did you know what I wanted?" she asked him.</p> <p>"I could tell."</p> <p>"I don't know."</p> <p>He pulled up her skirt just enough that she couldn't see what he was looking at. "I'm glad that we've both finally got that worked up."</p> <p>"Me too."</p> <p>He pulled her legs apart and he felt himself grow harder even while he could still see her. In the back of his mind, in his heart, in his head, he knew he would come just looking at her.</p> <p>"When do you think I'm gonna eat you?" he asked. She thought back to her own words:</p> <p>"My first time with a man...I thought you'd kill me," she paused, but she still didn't know how to answer him. She couldn't. "I'm sorry," she said.</p> <p>He kissed her gently and then he said, "This whole afternoon, your whole day, your entire day...maybe you can give me pleasure like I'm giving you now."</p> <p>She was confused but she felt safe just leaning into him, holding him close to her and smelling his hair. He put his lips against her ear and nibbled her lightly. "There will always be a taste of you in your mouth if ever you like," he explained.</p> <p>She didn't know how to feel about that. She knew there was a chance he wasn't just making up some sort of game to see who might have the power to make her cry. And he was doing that. She still couldn't bring herself to think about it. All she could do was hold onto his shoulders and wonder.</p> <p>When he stood up and said, "You're still trembling so I thought I'd give you a little bit of relief," he put both of his hands around her from behind and caressed her neck.</p> <p>She felt her body relax and she smiled up at his eyes. "So much fun to have," she said. She felt her heart rate go up even more. She didn't know how to describe itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
