We have to get you some proper clothes."</p> <p>She nodded, biting her bottom lip softly. "Yeah. Okay. No strings. I'm good."</p> <p>He took her in his arms again with a sigh and squeezed her affectionately. "Aww, you're so nice and strong, you look wonderful, like a princess."</p> <p>"Thanks, sweetie. It's only going to get better."</p> <p>He gave her a kiss on the forehead and then turned around to put his hands on the steering wheel. "I can say, a lot worse than you."</p> <p>"No! Not at all." She pulled out the back of the cab, leaning against the doorframe with her palms planted on the window. Her heart raced, and her stomach clenched.</p> <p>He gave her a half-smile and took her hand in his, kissing it. "See. You can't be bad, just so sweet and gentle, so young, and everything, if you don't have too."</p> <p>"I don't think I have too," she agreed, putting her hands on his shoulders. "And I don't want to," she added, moving her fingers down his chest, feeling the soft muscle move beneath. Her heart raced and her head spun with desire for him. "You're so... hot."</p> <p>"Oh, yeah," he said with a smile, kissing her palm again. "You can still get me for a few days, you'll see."</p> <p>She laughed nervously. "You're a lot more handsome than that," she said, lifting her chin, her cheeks pinkening at the thought. "We haven't done anything yet, but it's been great."</p> <p>"Well, we have." He looked up at her. "I just wish I could help you with something."</p> <p>She shook her head as she took a deep breath, smiling up at him. "I don't have a lot of room on the couch."</p> <p>"Nonsense," he drawled, running a finger across her cheek. He leaned over, and kissed her on the lips. "You're all I need," he said. "I won't be able to look at you with my mouth full of your wonderful womanly curves until you're done. But, just for that, I think I'd love to take you on the sofa and have you curl up onto my lap."</p> <p>She grinned. "Oh, you don't have to say anything."</p> <p>He put his arms tight around her. "I know."</p> <p>She reached up and ran her fingers through his hair, pressing against his shoulder. "I know, silly," she whispered, kissing him on the cheek. He leaned his chin down to give her a kiss, and then let go. "But right now, my heart's in the right place," he said, turning back.</p> <p>She watched him, enjoying the heat of his lips and the softness of his voice. It made her heart jump but she kept her own smile in check, trying to get things moving. He moved over and sat down on the couch beside her. She leaned over and kissed him on the mouth, and then leaned back down, putting her hands on his thighs.</p> <p>He smiled at her and kissed her again, his hands stroking her thighs, feeling the softness of her skin. Then, he ran his fingertips up to the top of her panties. When they reached the button at the top, he paused a moment, pulling her closer. She took his hand and pressed it against her crotch. Their eyes met, and she watched him, as he moved his mouth over her lips. She closed her eyes and bit her lip.</p> <p>He let her kiss him, feeling her press against his fingers. She felt his cock growing against her belly, and she felt the softness of his lips against hers. Her pussy started to moisten, and he ran his thumb against her. When she opened her eyes again, she smiled, her body quivering.</p> <p>She opened her eyes again to look at him. "I'm starving," she said, running her fingertip underneath his chin. "I need to run." She leaned over and kissed him again, feeling the tingle of her juices against her flesh, then stood up, pulling him with her. He put his arms around her waist, pulling her against him. Their warm bodies felt wonderful pressed against one another.</p> <p>She slid a hand down the line of his chest, finding the zip of his zipper with her fingers. She unbuttoned it and slid her hand inside, feeling for his hardness, feeling the softness of his skin beneath her hand.
