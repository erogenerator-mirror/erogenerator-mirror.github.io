I could hear her moan in ecstasy when I did the same for her. I let my middle finger slide down her slit, searching for her clit and finding it, pressing lightly on it gently then slipping just a little farther in, slowly rotating my fingers as I did so. I began to move my finger faster now, pushing it slowly past her tight pussy lips, the tip rubbing the sensitive clit in little circles, then back to pressing on it lightly again and again. I could tell that she was getting close. I pressed another two fingers inside her then spread them open. Her fingers locked themselves together, squeezing them tightly, almost as if she were afraid to let them separate further. I pressed it again, then pushed it inside again. Again, slowly, but ever in a steady rhythm until I had her legs spread wide and were stroking her whole pussy for me. I slid my fingers out from her pussy and found that she was really wet, soaked, and slippery, as always. I slid two fingers in just a little, then drew them back out and went back in. Again, slowly... slowly. Then two fingers slid over her clitoris, circling it very lightly, then slipping a little more inside, just a little way in. I could hear her breath go deep and quick with anticipation. The pressure of her pussy against my fingers was driving me towards my own orgasm. I could feel myself getting closer. I wanted her cum all over my hand with an incredible pleasure. I wanted to be inside her so bad I could taste it. I wanted to feel her cum all over my hand.</p> <p>I continued to tease her, sliding in just a little, then pulling out to caress her clit a little. I slid two fingers back all the way in again, circling her clitoris a little more. Then I pressed them both at the same time as my tongue licked her pussy, again slipping around her whole pussy. My tongue followed the path my fingers had just taken to her clit, licking along it, probing. When I came up she came, just as I had. I felt her shudder and heard her scream out. Her orgasm seemed to last a long time, but still, it seemed like time went in quick, but not too fast. When it finally ended she just lay there next to me on the bed, spent.</p> <p>We lay there, her head on my chest, me laying in the sheets. She seemed asleep as I lay there in her soft curves. But there was a small part of me that wanted to sleep, dream, all the things we had done togetherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
