Maybe you've made it to the top, too? Let's just say that you're one of the best at it. That could be the reason for my coming to New York... to meet my new husband."</p> <p>"So that's why it took me a while making arrangements, wasn't it?" She laughed. "Now that the heat in my pussy has kicked down, I have this lovely guy."</p> <p>"What?" I asked, incredulously. "And why is it so great for you?"</p> <p>"I wanted to know why you weren't going to be able to take my proposal to your new life as your friend!" she laughed.</p> <p>Her face reddened. "I'm sorry, but yes, I really wanted to hear it."</p> <p>"And you want me too," I replied, "and I really don't want to do that..."</p> <p>"No, it's alright. There's just something... I know you wanted to and I just needed to know your opinion." She paused, then turned to face me, a small smile tugging at the corners of her face. "What do you think?"</p> <p>"It's very complicated," I said, "but yes... and I'd be honoured to say that I would like for you to try."</p> <p>"Good," She said with a smile. "I'll just have to let me finish explaining it and ask him what he thinks if I'm wrong... He'll get the message."</p> <p>She laughed, then stood and we walked out to our cars. She handed me a card and said "See you in the morning at exactly eight."</p> <p>"What? Why?"</p> <p>"I just need to take a bit of time to sort things out. I'll see you tomorrow morning in New York."</p> <p>I was confused again. "Who else is going to be helping me move?" "I'm sure that's not a problem. You'll just have to wait to be settled then. We both know that's not going to happen." She kissed me.</p> <p>"You're not going to need an escort when you graduate?" I laughed.</p> <p>"Nope, I'll just take one at a party instead." She said, then turned and left.</p> <p>As we walked home I contemplated how my relationship with her might go. She was intelligent and fun to be with, but it didn't make all the difference between what I could and couldn't say. She was also incredibly pretty. I loved her to bits and I wondered if maybe there was some sort of chemistry going on that wasn't there between us.</p> <p>The End - Prologue</p> <p>Note to reader: This story involves the story of my fiancée and me living in the same world that my ex-wife is living now. So my stories are much like the ones from my high school past life and the ones in the future of my relationship with our new friend in NY. My real name is Alexia, with all my friends as well as myself on the internet. Alexia and I met several months before moving away from our high school and she was one of my first real girlfriends when I was in my first year in America. While I enjoyed a lot of the other girls at my school who were very pretty, Alexia was the exception. She was also my first real boyfriend and, while I didn't mind spending time with her in the city (I had to get an apartment) we decided that, after six years of dating, a change might be the best thing. I felt that it was just a matter of time before it was time for a break.</p> <p>On my birthday my sister Anna was taking me shopping after the holiday, asking if I would like to see my dad's farm in town. The first thing she pulled from the shelf was a yellow card. She had left a note on the outside the door but I didn't even notice that the label was black.</p> <p>"Thanks, Daddy" she said. I knew that I was lucky in many ways to have a loving father. She was happy to be home and happy to be a member of the world, a part of a more unique and unique world. She told me that she had been with other men in the past and that she had very few regrets.</p> <p>I was so excited and excited that I thought I heard my sister calling me on the phone from her house. "I was worried you might get sick," she had assured me on one of many occasions. "Now, can I come pick you up? I'm at your house and you're having some errands. We need to be in bed together." She had giggled, then added, "And I hope you don't mind; I told you that I would be in the middle and the kids were sleeping on—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
