Her hands were warm. My cock was rock hard. I tried to touch her hair and said, "Bella, this is embarrassing. I can't. I'm not gay."</p> <p>She pulled her head back. I took her face in my hands. She looked me in the eyes and I said, "Bella, I think you know what you're doing but it's wrong." She put her arms around me and hugged against me, pushing away for a moment. I think my heart stopped. Then, in a whisper, she said, "I've wanted you for a long time so I want to take care of this... this thing with you."</p> <p>She unzipped my pants and gently, not too gently, pulled my semi-erect cock out. Then, with slow, deliberate movements she wrapped her soft, beautiful fingers around it and began masturbating it slowly.</p> <p>I could hardly take it. I hadn't had a man since in college and I was so excited it felt like my heart had stopped, and my breath was coming in ragged gasps.</p> <p>"Bella, we can't!" I managed to say. I had to get closer.</p> <p>"Yes, baby, we can."</p> <p>Now she had her free hand and began running it through my hair. Then she kissed the side of my neck, and then she took my entire length deeply into her hot, wet mouth. Her lips were so soft there that I thought I'd never stop. Her tongue darted over me with incredible skill and I think I might have cried for the whole time, even stopping just long enough to say, "God, yes."</p> <p>I reached down and took her chin in my other hand. I looked into her eyes and said, "Bella, I want to cum so fucking bad. Please."</p> <p>She put her head back down and I felt her teeth graze my neck as I felt her begin to moan around me. I held her tightly, as far at the moment as I could, and then pressed against her and began shooting spurt after spurt into her mouth.</p> <p>She kissed me long and deep. Then, she pulled back and said, "I'm going to clean you up."</p> <p>Her hand fell away. "Mmmmm, yes, mmmmm," she moaned, "That's nice."</p> <p>Bella was still straddling me and licking her lips. Then, with her hand still over mine, she slowly, sensually moved her mouth downward. For the next few moments I watched the action as her soft hair drifted between us, my half swollen cock, slipping back between her legs, then following closely behind and up toward her pussy.</p> <p>I can't believe how gorgeous and beautiful she was. I don't even know if it could get any better, but it did. And she was. It felt as if my entire soul had just been sucked away by her eyes and body, through her skin and into her mouth. And as she worked on me, I felt a little twinge of guilt and thought, "I've gone too far."</p> <p>She pulled me toward her, and as her legs went around me and we pressed, my cock was inside of her, and I felt myself being filled like never before, and she could barely move as I began to stroke in and out of her. I was overwhelmed with pleasure, and I realized I was almost as full as that first time with Jennifer. She was as much of a woman as she was a man, as she was of her own volition.</p> <p>Bella took the full length of me that night. She leaned forward, and I could feel her hands on my chest. She began to rock her hips against me and I could feel the pressure of her fingers in my hair. My mind began to make sense again. I was with someone, and they wanted me to be hers. We were both with her!</p> <p>I was so overwhelmed by my feelings and feeling me inside of her, that I hardly noticed that in the back of my mind, that she had stopped moving and stopped moaning. We lay there for a moment, as my consciousness felt as if it was coming back, and then she began to move again, so slowly, so seductively.</p> <p>Then, as I felt myself building toward a full-blown orgasm, I told her, "Bella, this is not a good time."</p> <p>"Well, my god, you're not going to leave me?"</p> <p>"Bella darling, I think I want that to be the first time you've ever allowed somebody to touch your pussy and lick it." My mind registered that and we began to move faster, more urgently.</p> <p>Bella had raised her feet up onto the sides of the couch. They left her legsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
