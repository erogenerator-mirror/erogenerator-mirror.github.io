But a lot. Some of the times, I have been a bit more of a handful. A little more." He paused and looked around, finding the rest of his clothing from home and laying them on the floor.</p> <p>"This is more than I should take." he said, sitting up.</p> <p>"That's better, than it would feel in here, with all that water." I said, stepping into the shower and starting to step in, not wanting to get any water on me. Sam's eyes followed me, and a smile slid across his face. I started to turn around, but he quickly pushed me back down before I could really turn around.</p> <p>"Don't." He said quietly, and I felt his arms tighten around me and his body press against mine. He began to kiss me, one hand working my breast. I put my hands on his chest, squeezing it as he worked me over. His tongue slowly made its way into my mouth, exploring it, teasing me. I wrapped my legs around him, pulling my lips away from him.</p> <p>I wrapped my arms around Sam, feeling him shift position on the shower floor for me. He gently held onto me as he entered me, and moaned as he slipped inside of me.</p> <p>He leaned in and gave me a long, deep, lustful kiss as he started to move within me. I pushed my tongue against his and moaned as he started to move inside me.</p> <p>"Sam." I breathed, pulling away slightly to look at him through heavy breaths. "I want you to be me." I groaned, reaching up to capture his hand and pushing the other up to my breast.</p> <p>He looked at me for a moment, and then began to pick up the pace as a shiver rippled down his spine. He grabbed and squeezed at my legs, drawing them to him as he drove into me faster.</p> <p>"Sam. Oh, Sam." I said as he leaned down to kiss me again.</p> <p>He groaned, and pulled himself from my body. I moaned as the water poured over us at the same time. Feeling my body tense up, I put my hand on his chest to hold onto. He groaned out loud and pressed himself against me, pulling himself out slightly and then shoving himself back in. After a few minutes, I began to push myself toward him, and he groaned out loud in response. I pulled his body tighter against mine and we continued to make love as we watched each other fuck me over and over.</p> <p>Finally, I felt the first waves of pleasure wash over me and I moaned a bit as I felt his cock throbbing inside of me. He groaned out, then kissed me gently on the lips.</p> <p>"I'm gonna come soon, sweetheart. Are you still ready to fuck?" He asked.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm very ready, Sam." I said, smiling. He smiled back, and kissed my breast. "Please." I said as he picked up his pace, his cock slipping faster within me.</p> <p>I wrapped my legs around him, and pulled him into me to drive it as deep as he could go. He groaned, and I felt myself reaching my limit as my insides clamped around him in time with the pulsating pulse of his cock. He leaned into me as he started to come, and I could feel his weight on top of me, his body pressing against my, his arms wrapping around me, his lips on my neck as I felt him shiver and tighten. I felt his cock contract as he shot inside me, and I felt myself shake and quiver around him. He kissed me, pushing against me as he did so, and I felt his heart beat against me until he finally pulled away, letting go of my hands.</p> <p>He kissed me again and then, he slid out of me, turning me so that the water was running away from us and letting the hot spray hit both of us. He stood up, turning us so we were facing the wall and wrapping his arms around me from behind. I smiled against my hair, and he smiled at me. He gently bent me over the end of the shower, and pushed his cock back into me, causing both of us to groan.</p> <p>Once my back was against the tile wall, he turned to me and reached his arm around me to put his hands on my breasts. He pulled me upright so that I was leaning on his back and started to move within me. His hands left my breasts, and I reached up to pull his face close to me as I felt his lips kiss along my jawline again as I felt his cock sliding into me.</p> <p>He leaned into me, his hips making it hard to hold onto him. I felt his hands cup the sidesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
