Finally, he let go of her legs and sat back as he regained the control over his limbs again. She felt like a rag doll, naked, but still so very helpless; and he was right; her body belonged to him, and she was in the middle of one very intense orgasm. She was so close; a small, soft sob escaped her lips as she watched him reach down and pinch and tug on each of her nipples as she lay there, her body quivering, her breathing uneven.</p> <p>He turned her chair around just enough, but still in front of his table. He sat her back down on her seat, facing her, one foot on the floor, the other dangling from the other. He leaned over her, his cock still in her pussy, and wrapped his arms around her. She was still breathing rapidly.</p> <p>He kissed her on her neck.</p> <p>"Shhh, baby," he whispers in her ear. "Just lay there, and enjoy it. You got off so strong tonight, and you got me all hard again... just lay there, okay?"</p> <p>Her trembling thighs were still trembling. She could not move... she couldn't move. She just lay there, completely naked and vulnerable, and he just lay there, kissing her neck.</p> <p>He reached one hand behind her back and gently pushed her face down onto the table. Slowly, he ran a finger along her anus. It started at her ass, and spread over her pussy. Then he ran his finger around her labia, pushing and spreading the lips. Once again, she was still breathing heavily but still very still. She felt as though she could have died and gone to heaven.</p> <p>He leaned over her, still sitting on the seat. He wrapped his arms around her and slowly moved her body backward, pressing her back until they were touching her chest. Her naked shoulders and arms were almost touching her knees. She felt a warm, soft, tender hand on her, massaging her back, moving it down and then toward her breasts. When they encountered each other, she jumped from the touch. It was not as gentle as he would want it to be, but it felt different, almost like a touch of fire. She felt his fingertips and fingers on her nipples and her body tensed and relaxed. This time, she felt it as a touch all the way down to her clitoris.</p> <p>She felt a finger slowly trace along her slit, circling around her opening on the first try.</p> <p>"Oh, my baby," he murmured into her ear. "You have a beautiful clit. It's lovely."</p> <p>He slid two fingers inside her, then began slowly moving them in and out. When he found that she was wet, he pushed just enough to work her clit, and at last it was in her hands.</p> <p>He leaned forward, placing his head next to hers as he kept pumping her with his fingers, kissing her mouth. He kissed her eyelids, moving back down to her other lip. His fingers felt her, too. He was in charge, now. He kissed and softly kissed her neck and her lips and neck again and again. She could see his cock, still rock-hard, now pressing into her stomach, now touching her stomach. He rubbed her clitoris, moving his hips, as one of his fingers slid in and out and around. It was wonderful to his fingers.</p> <p>He moved his cock closer to her, but remained silent. She felt it, but her eyes and her body told her nothing. She began moving her hips towards him and felt his cock, feeling the hardness and weight, the heat and stiffness. Now, it was her turn to open her legs completely, moving one to him. Now his cock would fit perfectly inside her.</p> <p>He reached down with both hands, one in each hand. His fingers found their way into her pussy, and he began to move his hips in small circles. She moaned her appreciation and began moving her hips again. Now he moved his hips against hers rhythmically as he began to massage her clitoris and push and pull on it with his fingers. His cock was still rock hard, and it could never go down. He moved his hips back and forth quickly, grinding his hardness into her, the head of it against her belly.</p> <p>His hand was still inside her, and he was breathing hard.</p> <p>"Are you ready for me, baby?" he asked. She was breathing raggedly and her body was shaking.</p> <p>"Oh GOD, I am -- SO ready," she whispered. "I want -- I NEED this," she moaned, almost out of breath, now and tears were streaming down her face. "Oh God, Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
