I hadn't been able to put it in my mouth, and that made her happy. In turn, this lovely woman had wrapped her hand around my shaft just a short while ago, and now she was slowly stroking it gently.</p> <p>I knew she felt guilty about the fact that she'd done that with me, and what a turn- on it had been for her to see me cum, and I knew I hadn't been able to let go. "God, it's so wonderful," she said dreamily.</p> <p>"Thank you," I said. I began to pant, and she laughed, putting my hand on her breast.</p> <p>"Thank you for what, baby?" she asked, and I smiled. "It's never so good, even on the first day, isn't it? No, it's so good. Why, why does it feel so wonderful, doesn't it? We've just had so many orgasms, and it's never felt so wonderful for me. Oh, yes, baby, it feels wonderful. It's never felt better, and now we've done it right."</p> <p>"It certainly does, baby. I've never felt so good ever. We never did it that way to one another, so I wouldn't say it was ever a 'wrong' thing to do with each other."</p> <p>"Oh, so now, you now?"</p> <p>She looked at me as if she was about to speak. The expression on her face made it clear that no words were necessary.</p> <p>"Don't stop," I said.</p> <p>"It's okay," she said, taking me inside her, moving her hips to get me as deep as she could go. She reached down and began rubbing her clit, and I could tell her other hand was working her own.</p> <p>"God, yes, don't stop. Fuck me, baby, fuck me," she gasped. "Oh, yes, baby....."</p> <p>To my astonishment, she came in a shuddering rush. I didn't know if it was an orgasm of pure pleasure, but I knew I'd cum. I was right on the edge.</p> <p>"Oh, God, yes, baby, I'm cumming, darling. I'm cumming, I'm cumming."</p> <p>She just grinned up at me and said, "I love you, baby, you're so sweetâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
