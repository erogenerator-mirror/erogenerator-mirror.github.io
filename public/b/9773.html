We had sex once but that had been a clumsy affair. Maybe it was my time for me to assert myself by being in control of her, to enjoy her body and to enjoy her mind and soul without feeling I had to be in control. With my fingers gently caressing her inner thighs, my head nestled on her hip, I heard her gasp as my tongue darted out, parting her outer lips and making it's way to her clitoris. She felt so sensuous and so beautiful, and the more aroused I got on this end of her, the more I loved her and the more I worshipped her. I made love to her body with renewed affection and determination, and her eyes widened as her fingers slid inside me to find that I had been working harder to drive myself even further home. Her hand was no longer working my cock, but it was not slow in its movements. She was pushing against my face, urging me to drive her more and more quickly than ever before.</p> <p>Suddenly she came and my body went rigid, the sensations driving through me with such intensity as I thought I would burst. I held to her, feeling her warmth, her softness, and the feeling of her hand in my chest pressing me hard against the wall. All my thoughts of control and submission fled away from me, I just felt so content.</p> <p>Her hand slid down to find my dick again and I found myself pulling on my own hand to force it out as her fingers joined their own on my throbbing cock.

When she took the tip in her mouth, my body jerked, my whole being stiffening as she slid my length between her lips and let the head linger between them to gather it's essence. The effect she had to be having on me was very arousing and I felt as I had never been with a woman before, although I had been with lots of women before.</p> <p>It was like watching a film where the man took his wife to orgasm after orgasm. Every thrust, like a battering ram from a battering ram, was met with a moan from me as her hand cupped my balls in my sack, and her tongue laved my head in a way that sent me over the edge, just as my own finger made a motion with the tip of my finger that brought our bodies together in orgasm once again. We lay quietly for a few minutes, enjoying the sensation that our touch had on one another and trying to come to terms with what had just happened.</p> <p>"You're still hard." She whispered. "You're still turned." She smiled to herself as she ran her fingertips around my dick, it began to rise on its own. "Would you like to have a piece of that?" She asked. It was clear that she was referring to my cock as it, too, had become stiff again.</p> <p>"I will," I murmured. "As soon as we get home."</p> <p>She gave me a quick peck on the lips, then a smile, then turned on her side and lay down on her back. "I have to take charge as well," she said.
