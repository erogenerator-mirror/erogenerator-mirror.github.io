She bends over over him, showing her sweet pussy and sweet tight ass, the red lips open and pouting.</p> <p>"Do you like it?" she giggles then bites her lip a minute before she puts her ass back down.</p> <p>"No but I am going to like it."</p> <p>Her pussy glistens and her anus a deep red, the tight hole is clenching so tight around his massive shaft. It doesn't hurt, just makes her hotter. She puts her heels on his ass to rub his big cock through her.</p> <p>He lifts his hips to make it easier but he's almost too big to take so he grins when she rubs her pussy up the length of him. She is making him crazy, he wants to drive his cock into her in the same motion she's doing to herself but she still pulls away a little then places her heels on his ass to spread him open.</p> <p>She's teasing his cock and clit with her fingers so he starts to drive back then pushes again.</p> <p>"Harder."</p> <p>She smiles then takes him completely into her mouth. She pushes down on him.</p> <p>"Yes. Oh, yes, suck me. Suck it. Oh my god."</p> <p>The words hit his brain. His cockhead is hitting the back of her throat. That's so good for her, for him, not her husband. She gags hard so he pushes his cock in. This feels so good. No. No. A moan escapes her throat.</p> <p>"I love your cock in me," she says before pushing back onto him.</p> <p>"Yeah," he groans as she pulls away.</p> <p>Laughing a bit she pushes herself back onto him. Her legs are shaking.</p> <p>"I need you in me, baby."</p> <p>His head turns a corner. He wants to just take her in this way in the ass but he knows she is so wild that she will get hurt. It's part of her life and he couldn't get over how much he loved it.</p> <p>"I love you, I love you," she says then kisses him and slides his cock from her mouth.</p> <p>It was only going to be the second time that I came in her ass. But first I thought I would be in there. The thought had never crossed my mind.</p> <p>I wonder will it hurt. Maybe I'm just doing this to make her mine then it will be over. But maybe she's thinking of me but not me. Just him. I wonder if we will have an audience.</p> <p>"Is that ok, it could even hurt a little?" he wonders if her husband's cock feels good in her ass. "Would you really like to stick your cock in me?</p> <p>She's never going to be a bad thing, she has already done this a million times and she will do it again but no. I never have.</p> <p>I want what she wants, I need it.</p> <p>I want to fuck my ass.</p> <p>"Oh god yes. I want you in me."</p> <p>She climbs off of him but leaves on her heels. Her tits are swollen and her nipples are puffy from her excitement. Her ass hole is red raw from the spanking she received. Her skin is sweaty and her pussy is all pink and tender. And a part of her wants to get some of that but she can't really. Her mind is already wandering and wanting more.</p> <p>"Oh I want you," she says moving from him to lie down on the pillows. "I want your cock in me."</p> <p>"Do you want me?" he asks as he kneels in front of her. He wants her to do it but he's nervous. Part of him is scared but the other part is excited by the possibilities. A part of him is afraid to admit his fears so he reaches forward with his fingers. He feels her hand on his wrist. This is better. It makes it easier and a part of the fantasy's excitement.</p> <p>"Yes," he tells her.</p> <p>"Yes. Right."</p> <p>The fingers touch her nipple then she moans a moan.</p> <p>"Oh, you do that so well," she says looking down. "I love it."</p> <p>"You do that," he says.</p> <p>"I love it." She rubs her nipple against his palm.</p> <p>"Yeah," he says.</p> <p>"It soo good."</p> <p>"We have much more in common than just sex," he thinks. "We have a lot in common." The thought fills his head. That is true.
