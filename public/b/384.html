Even with the sex in them, none of it was too intense to take up the slack. They told me I had really opened up and it wouldn't take long for me to realize I liked them. So, I put on panties, a bra, and a teddy bear and wandered into the bar where our table was.</p> <p>The music was soft, and the drinks were the drinks. We had our food. I had my legs open in our booth. I sipped my drink in silence.</p> <p>"Oh, come on!" he said, and sat down. I smiled to myself. "What happened?"</p> <p>"Well, I didn't see your bra. I don't have many people I know sitting there," I answered. "Can you believe I just did that?"</p> <p>"I do," is all he said. I'm not sure if I wanted him to say it, but I knew it wasn't good to let him be so damn rude.</p> <p>We were at a lull and I looked out at the city around us. It was quiet from this far up in the mountains to the city. I sipped my drink again and looked out the window again. I think my heart was in it. We were on the verge of making love that night. I couldn't stop thinking about it! Just having sex on this beach, just the thought of me actually doing it, made me nervous. I looked him over for a moment, and he didn't seem to care.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I said again.</p> <p>"Yes, yes, I'm sure," he said. "I think I'm going to enjoy this evening."</p> <p>"I want this to be as close to what I want when I take you to my room," I said.</p> <p>"Well, if you say so," he said. "I want this to be exactly the way we're going tonight."</p> <p>"Why is it so hard for you to let me go?" I queried.</p> <p>"Because I do it so that I can make you come, not because I let you make me do it."</p> <p>"Just saying so, you're making me nervous to do this," I answered.</p> <p>"No, I'm not," he assured me. "You and me are just that. It's us, the night we're going to see some more things. It doesn't get any stranger. I'm just doing my thing. Nothing to be ashamed of. We're going to have fun with it. It's time we put this past the first time we go out. But, right now, at the end of it, I want you to get as wild as you want to be. I'm not going to let you stop. Do you understand?"</p> <p>I nodded my head in agreement.</p> <p>"There are two little rooms on the beach, in the middle of a big, well-kept forest," he said. "Don't look so surprised, you know. There's nothing to be ashamed of. This is what we're going to be doing for ages."</p> <p>He reached across me and picked up my drink and gave me a big smile. I leaned closer and kissed him lightly on the lips. He looked over his shoulder at the other people that were sitting on the other side of the table. I couldn't believe my eyes, I'd completely forgot how crazy they were and I wanted to get this over with, but he had me in his hand, I couldn't do anything else. We broke from our kiss to look at each other. He started to say something back to me in his head, but I cut him off.</p> <p>I had a good idea what he was thinking and what he was thinking before he said anything else. I kissed him lightly on the lips and said, "Just go on with your plan."</p> <p>"It really isn't that hard," he said. "I have to be up early tomorrow morning to get some work done and then I'd better meet up with a bunch of friends at a pool in the harbor we're talking about."</p> <p>"I know that," I said to him. "But, that doesn't mean I don't want you to. So, where are we headed then?"</p> <p>"Your place is in a little cottage off the Harbor, about 100 miles up in Closerboat Park. Now, lets just call it 'our place.'"</p> <p>"You're still not going to take me there?" I asked him.</p> <p>"No, I'm going to walk with you," he said. "It will be just as quiet as the rest of the beach."</p> <p>"Let's go," I said. "I want to go there naked."</p> <p>"Noâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
