I chuckled. "There ain't a damn thing you can do about it. Maybe we'll talk more while I enjoy our fun."</p> <p>"Just remember, it's probably in the past. There may be a new life ahead," he said with a sad smile. "I'll try to come up with something when and if we can think of anything. Now, where were we," he said and smiled. "No, I am not here."</p> <p>I grinned, "No, you are. Just sit there and enjoy the ride while we can talk more, too."</p> <p>"I have to say, you're a most delightful ride," he said, not looking at me as he opened the door.</p> <p>I stopped him and took him in my arms. He seemed to be surprised at the contact of our bodies together and I let him wrap his arms around me and we stood there kissing and touching as we explored the softness and warmth of the other's body. When his hands began to run up and down my backside, I could feel the heat of his body against mine. We stood side by side not looking at one another, enjoying the feel of the other's body when it was exposed to us, as it was now. My hands wandered all over his body, from his shoulders and ribs to his hips and back, feeling each of his muscles, not so much the one on his ass, but the one on his waist, just the right one and one-eights, which was almost as smooth as the rest of him in the softness of his suit as it was hard yet smooth, just the right height for my fingers to find it.</p> <p>When he broke free of our kiss and looked out the window to see the time, I felt that my mouth was watering. I guess that meant that I'd gotten a little too carried away while we had been making the trip to this cottage the way his body felt at that moment. I tried again to look at him as he stood facing the window, watching the traffic and the passing of the cars along the road. I knew that he was looking back at us with obvious excitement and I smiled inwardly as I stood there with my lips so close to his ear that I could feel the pulse of his neck. His arms had been around me and he was caressing me with one hand, as he did it when we were making love. I looked out the window and saw that the houses along the road were full and people were moving. The street lights behind us were flashing, giving enough of a flash to leave the world outside and we could hear the occasional, "Whoops!" and "Mmmmmmm."</p> <p>"That's it," I whispered as my hands stopped fondling his buns and my thighs parted a little more. "Move your knees just a little," I urged, letting his body slip up against mine and his hand slip out from under me and to find my crotch. I felt his hand cup my warm, panty-covered labia and then slide down and around behind it, touching and feeling the moist heat of my most private place against his bare hand.</p> <p>"Oh, that's nice," I sighed as I felt his fingers move into me and enter me, just a bit further. "You're a quick learner," I added as the heat of his hand increased. "I've never made love in the way that I imagined this would be," I said a little louder as I felt myself growing hot and wet and wet against his hand. "Your cock is in me," I said.</p> <p>"And I'm hard as a rock," he smiled at me as he continued to fondle me, the touch of his hands on the flesh of my inner thighs sending little shivers up and down my body and making it tingle. Then my head was thrown back and I could feel him slowly begin to work his fingers faster between my legs. He had worked my body from top to bottom and it felt so good, yet the heat of his touch was more intense than the other.</p> <p>I saw that the houses across the road seemed even emptier as the people on them passed by, and I could tell that he was feeling much the same. Even when our hands came together a little faster and our hips thrust a little harder, our motions were a little shorter. I felt that I was in the midst of a major lovemaking session, and I was not even trying to imagine what was going on. I had thought it to be a gentle exploration of my inner private regions by a man, yet he was doing things to me I had not imagined. One part of me wanted nothing more than to make love to him, while the other part seemedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
