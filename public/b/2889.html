And I don't want to cause the whole town any bother with me."</p> <p>"What do I have to do with any help you might wish to give us, Mr. Matson? I cannot afford to lose my job."</p> <p>"I understand that, but I need you to find someone to fill in the time you have left. I will be gone almost from this office when I go back Monday and there will be no one else there working.</p> <p>"I believe I said more than I could possibly do but I still wish I could be able to make it work out. So I am willing to offer the company you want to help you with in addition to the free office space you already have."</p> <p>He stared at her for a very long moment. "You are a good-looking young lady. I have to tell you that will never happen again."</p> <p>"Well, I have a proposition for you. I will be opening my own accounting firm on Monday and will be running an estimate through that. If we can meet, I will get us a meeting place for all our expenses from our office and we can get this done before Friday. If we don't get the meeting place before Friday, I don't think I will need your money again."</p> <p>"That might be possible if we meet now, but I really do need to get home. I will still be there working tomorrow. When I leave I will bring a copy of the notice I would send out by tomorrow morning.</p> <p>I will be sure to make sure that everything is in order and will have you on it as quickly as I can get it."</p> <p>"That is a good offer. I have to be back in mid-day. I have to go back before this town closes tonight. If I get in early I might have to stay in the office until noon. We can call the office on my cell now and I will call you from there." She leaned over and gave him a quick kiss.</p> <p>"When I leave, just let me know how things are going and tell me that I can come back early."</p> <p>"I will get the message when I get back."</p> <p>She went back to her desk and put away her things. Once she did she went over to her home office. She sat back down and leaned on her desk. She closed her eyes and thought about the possibilities of this new arrangement going forward. With the new money and the chance to move in she could afford this.</p> <p>She got up and got ready for work. She checked everything she could to make sure that it came straight to her. She had a date set up with her new boss in the morning and she wanted to wait. She knew she could get a new job at least before the end of the month.</p> <p>By that time her lunch break was finally over. She had a lot to do before she would be able to call him. As she stood at the door she realized she had only a couple minutes until her date started to take place. She would have to wait until he went away that time.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Monday was more of the same. In addition to work he was getting very little. He was not going to spend his money.</p> <p>When he got to work on Monday he found a couple of hours off but none of them were to take place until he got off work. His next appointment was going to be at seven:30. He found a place to park a couple blocks away so he would not be in any traffic to get to it. The day progressed as he knew it would.</p> <p>He got a call from his boss about two hours before his time. He called his secretary. When she answered she said, "Hi."</p> <p>"What's wrong?"</p> <p>"I need to talk to you about what I need from our company. You are not needed to be there until after the meeting. I am sorry, but I need to talk with someone about this.</p> <p>"I need to tell you I need to be there for six."</p> <p>"Can you come to my office again next Saturday?"</p> <p>"I will be there."</p> <p>"Thank you, but what time are you looking at it?"</p> <p>"I will pick you up at six."</p> <p>"I am looking forward to meeting you. Do you have a place by your office?"</p> <p>"I have a booth at the back of the building. I can park it over there and park it here." He gave her the address.</p> <p>The conversation was cordial despite its abruptness. There was no doubt he would meet his new boss and she would be his secretary. The decision to go to her and introduce him as her boss wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
