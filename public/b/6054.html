"Thank you."</p> <p>After a final kiss, he pulled her back to him, and with a final squeeze on her ass and a final tug on her shirt, he led the way to the exit. He followed her into the garage. He parked his car and opened the door for her. She was on her knees and bent at the waist. He led her back to his house.</p> <p>He pulled her up inside the door. "Good girl," he said, and he kissed her again before opening the door. He led her into the other room where another queen-sized bed sat. He unzipped his pants and pulled them and his boxers off before lying on it and propping his upper body over it. As soon as she was properly situated, he moved overtop of her back and positioned himself between her legs. He pushed his cock into her pussy, and the head easily entered her.</p> <p>The room was quiet except for the sound, and the wet sound of his cock sliding in and out. He held her legs apart, and he slid his cock into her mouth, which seemed to get harder and wetter as she got more comfortable. He was close now. "Suck me, sweetheart," he whispered, and he pulled out of her mouth, which was still dripping with her juices. He pushed her knees back to her shoulders.</p> <p>She felt his legs against her thighs. He began fucking her ass with his cock, making her grunt and arch her back. "Fuck that feels good," he said. He fucked her ass, his balls resting on the top of her thighs, the sound of his hard cock plunging in and out of her ass filling the room. He moved his cock deeper inside her, and she felt another orgasm, and his pelvis was bouncing against her cheeks as he fucked her.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum," he said, and he pulled his cock from her ass, and she felt empty.</p> <p>"I want you to cum on my mouth, baby," she said, and she turned and opened her mouth, and he shot cum in her face and over her mouth. He kept his cock in her mouth, jerking off, and his seed was thick and sticky. He moved so that it went all over her face, breasts, and hair in thick white ropes. He pulled from her mouth her panties, and she spread her legs. He lifted her up so that he could have her ass, facing into the other room. He placed one finger on her pussy, and she opened. He moved between her legs. She pushed him to the floor and straddled him, her feet on the floor, her legs spread as wide as they could go.</p> <p>He felt her pussy on his face. He kissed her. "It's my turn now, sweetheart." He pulled her to the edge of the bed and rubbed his cock against her pussy lips. He ran it up and down her slit, pushing inside her. He pulled back, making the head pop out. He pushed back in, and he looked at her face for a moment. "You look so sexy like this."</p> <p>"Do you like that?" she asked.</p> <p>"It's wonderful," and he began fucking her again.</p> <p>She had come close to cumming, but she still held it off. Her pussy was wet, and she spread her legs to feel how good it was. Suddenly she remembered something. The phone rang. "Oh, shit." She reached for the receiver, but he pushed her fingers off while he thrust into her pussy.</p> <p>"It's my husband." She heard the phone in the other room. "He, hello, hon."</p> <p>"Oh, crap. Oh, shit. I'm really sorry. I, umm," the sound of his voice caught in his throat as he took his cock out of her mouth. "I just, umm, I just, I forgot my cell."</p> <p>Tears ran down her cheeks. "My husband." She reached for the phone. It was his mother. She called to tell him what was going on and to be at her house at 6:30. She hung up the phone and leaned back against the bed, her legs crossed, legs bent at the knees. "I had a dream last night, you know?"</p> <p>"No, sweetheart, you were not dreaming. I just woke up, feeling you and my husband at the same time."</p> <p>She reached into her purse, and she handed the phone to him. "I can hear my husband, speaking to his secretary. He says he had a meeting to go to. Maybe he'll meet me in the lobby."</p> <p>"Sweetheart, it's your son's secretary. I'm just going to go to the bathroom right nowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
