"Fuck!"</p> <p>"That was so fucking good!"</p> <p>"Oh, God! Don't move," I groaned, desperately needing to feel him inside me.</p> <p>I needed some more, I wanted him inside me. But he wouldn't take that, not until he felt me trembling with desire, ready to be completely filled. He had to be ready to take me, too.</p> <p>"God, Kate. Your cunt is amazing," he whispered in my ear. "It feels so hot, so wet. You're making me so horny."</p> <p>And just when I felt as if I ought to die of thirst, he was reaching up to push his hands down inside my tank top.</p> <p>"Shit, Kate," I moaned, "you've got a little part of your body I should be fucking, too."</p> <p>My nipples had hardened even more, poking up through my cotton top. I had no idea what he was holding, but it was as if he had pulled the elastic out of the leg of my shorts. Instead, his hand brushed against them and I squealed in delight.</p> <p>"God, Kate, you're turning me on," he groaned, looking at my nipples poking through the tight tank top. I realized his hand had been inside, as well. His finger was pushing deep into my hole. I almost jumped, but managed to keep my balance. His hand was still rubbing my nipples, though he had moved to the legband of my shorts. He had undone it, then, and there was nothing to impede him while he fisted me.</p> <p>"Kate," I whimpered. "You have got to stop."</p> <p>"No, not yet," he whispered again, "it's time to fuck."</p> <p>It was like his fingers were stroking my clit, moving it up and down. The sensation was electrifying.</p> <p>"Please," I begged, unable to talk at all as the combination of that hot, thick finger inside me and his thumb on my nipple sent waves of sensation running through me. "Please."</p> <p>His other hand snaked around to the other side of me and took over, slipping under mine to begin rubbing my pussy lips. As he played with my lips, I felt the warmth of his thumb spreading my lips apart. As much as I hated the humiliation of saying this, the sensations were driving me crazy. My whole body quivered, but he had never looked at me like that. He was so gorgeous, and the way he looked at me as he fucked me was beyond anything I could imagine. And there it was, in his hand, just inches from my wet pussy. I couldn't believe I was actually saying this, but I wanted to hear it.</p> <p>"Please," I whimpered.</p> <p>"Please what," he chuckled, "please put your fingers inside me, please fuck me."</p> <p>"God, God," I moaned. "Please put your fingers inside there?"</p> <p>There was no hesitation in his words from last night--his fingers were not only inside my hot hole, but also exploring the folds, teasing me, preparing my body for the pleasures of his cock. "God, Kate, this is a good place. I can't imagine any better place. Fuck yourself on my fingers."</p> <p>"Oh, God, God," I moaned, and he had me at the point where he thought I couldn't take any more. He stroked my lips, teased me, made little circles on each side of them until I thought I was going to explode. Then he pushed the top button of my shorts and slid inside. A second finger inside me, and a third. My body began to quake in ecstasy, but his fingers on my slit and the thumb on my clit only served to heighten my already incredible levels of pleasure. I was whimpering. I was panting. The walls of my pussy clenched around his fingers, gripping them so tightly that I didn't think I would be able to withstand it all. He had the tightest, softest grip on my clit, and suddenly I felt it.</p> <p>I cried out.</p> <p>"Don't stop," I cried, trying to pull him up against the wall.</p> <p>My lips were dry and plump, but his touch was like nothing I had ever felt.</p> <p>My body shook as if I had just come, and the orgasm seemed to last forever. I couldn't tell how many times it went on, though—probably fifteen or twenty at most, but it was like an eternity. Sometimes, my cries would come out louder and more shrill, and the more I wanted him to move inside me, wringing the last few drops of my climax out of me.</p> <p>But—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
