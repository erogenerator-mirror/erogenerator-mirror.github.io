Leave it alone,” he said, putting it in his pocket and taking it to the shower.</p> <p>“Fine,” she said, as she followed suit, “But don’t use anything else to wash with.”</p> <p>I got out of the shower, and began to dry myself off, when she turned on the shower.</p> <p>“No, please, stay out of the water. I just want to get out of these clothes. I can’t take it any farther.” The water on her gorgeous body did nothing to ease her sadness. Her nipples hardened, and she shuddered. She quickly pulled her sweatshirt over her head, and turned around. She stood tall and sexy as hell.</p> <p>“What do you think? Is that good enough?” she said as she grabbed my cock and began to stroke me. She felt so good. She turned and bent over the tub. I moved behind her and slipped my rock hard cock into her warm and wet pussy. I began to fuck her as she took turns sucking the head of my cock.</p> <p>“Oh yeah baby, make me scream so good.”</p> <p>She had me close to coming, so she pulled off my cock and spun around to get my cock into her mouth. She sucked me deep and deep, then took all of me down to the root. This time she kept my entire length in her mouth until I was ready to erupt. I held back, trying to prolong the pleasure for as long as possible.</p> <p>“Don’t go,” my wife said between sucking, “don’t come just yet.”</p> <p>I pulled away from her mouth and kissed her on the lips, then moved my mouth to one of the other’s. We continued kissing and touching at the same time.</p> <p>We finally finished, then climbed out and got dressed.</p> <p>“Are you okay?” I asked once we were dressed.</p> <p>“Ohhh,” she said, “I’m fine. I can’t believe I let you do that to me. I didn’t really mean that, really. You know, the sex that you have with me isn’t real.”</p> <p>“It isn’t?”</p> <p>“Ohhhhh, I was hoping I could convince you to do more. That was fantastic. I never realized it would be that good until we finished.”</p> <p>“Well, that was great, but you didn’t get me hard again. That’s the biggest turn on of all. I’ve been wanting to do it to you for a while. If it was a turn on, how would you feel doing it to me? How would you feel while I did things to you?”</p> <p>“We sure are going to do it again,” she said, “If it makes you happy. I mean, if you’re willing.”</p> <p>I just laughed, and continued to do my thing with my wife, “No, we’re going home. But if it is something you like, we’ll go out and do it somewhere else. But don’t you dare ever cum in my mouth until we have sex. I just want to make you happy.”</p> <p>“I won’t even think about that,” she said.</p> <p>“Just be sure to take me home when we get back. We got off good, but if you ever want some, you know who to call.”</p> <p>The following day arrived and she greeted me in the doorway, “We got a surprise.”</p> <p>“Hmmmm,” I said, “What’s that?”</p> <p>“I want you to meet a friend. You need to do a little more than just meet friends. She is so cute, and she says she will be your next lover.”</p> <p>“Don’t do that to me. She’s married too, you know.”</p> <p>“Well you’re welcome to go with her, if you want. In fact, you can have it anytime you want. I’ll call you in the morning, and let you know about her. She is going to be gone for six weeks. She has the time of her life. You will love her. She’ll do what ever you tell her.”</p> <p>“Now are you going to be good for me?”</p> <p>“Yes.”—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
