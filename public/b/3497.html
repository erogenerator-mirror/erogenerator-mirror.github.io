She wasn't quite sure how long it would take. Finally, she spoke again, trying to speak to herself. "Ok, I guess. I'll go back and forth over it a little more. Let's see if I can take some of the pain. I can't move too much." Now, I think you might get the idea. If you do that, I'll go back to work for a bit." I'm only saying this because I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but she really didn't seem to care.</p> <p>We agreed not to press any further. Finally, I got up the nerve to ask about any new equipment. "I've got some more of those."</p> <p>We went back to the office and I saw that the woman had been standing, looking down the corridor, trying to see something. Once we got back to the office, she finally stood up and turned to face me. "Sorry," she said. She was looking around her office, not at me. "I'm so not looking to work. It's my boyfriend and it's not going to happen again... you're not looking to work either... I guess I'll just stay home and play with myself." She was shaking.</p> <p>"That's... what?" I asked.</p> <p>"It just really does nothing for me... I'm a woman, I just don't have the confidence that guys do. I guess it's more of an impulse to... let them feel this way... and that's kind of what some women do with their men. It's just sort of happened to my boyfriend. I tried for a long time."</p> <p>"Who?"</p> <p>"Well, it's not like you guys have a thing for him... It's just... not like you like it, but... let's just admit it was the biggest turn on for me!"</p> <p>"You mean...?"</p> <p>"Yeah!... I'm just really open to the idea... it's just, you know... it's just so embarrassing to see my boyfriend with another woman!"</p> <p>I was stunned. She was obviously thinking too hard about it. "That's totally out of line, honey! I wasn't talking about sex... I just mean... it's just... a very nice guy... and to put up with his 'toys' and 'games' for so long is... well... a real turn off."</p> <p>"Well, if it's too much for you, I'll just tell you to, and you can just let me know about anything you care about!" But my brain was saying something, and her speech was being very hesitant.</p> <p>"You don't have to do anything, I guess... I don't want to sound like I..."</p> <p>"Ohhh! No! of course I don't want anything; just the same as you. I'm just saying let you know, you don't have to tell anyone!"</p> <p>"I... uh..."</p> <p>"You mean..."</p> <p>"Yeah, of course!"</p> <p>She was trying to sort it out. I guess to find some way of dealing with her. But it was hard. She was looking at me like she was going to say something, maybe ask me about it, but she just couldn't... I guess it's hard sometimes to talk to someone you don't like... especially when you don't know what to say to them?"</p> <p>"It's just... it's just hard, really hard..."</p> <p>"Yeah," she said and we moved to the next level of the conference room. We had been listening a lot, just to say that we were glad to finally be moving on. "I'm just saying that it's kinda personal!"</p> <p>"There is nothing to be sorry for," I reminded her.</p> <p>"Well, I do have a boyfriend... and you have a brother in law... and all... and she's my fiancé..." she was crying again.</p> <p>"I'm so sorry," I said.</p> <p>"Well, not exactly... I have a lot of questions I need to be asked, and..."</p> <p>"OK," I said, trying to calm my situation. There was plenty of time to do that. I really didn't want to get into it.</p> <p>She started to stand up and then paused. "I'm sorry, I really have to go!" She started to walk out, but I reached for her hand. "I just wanted to say thank you for what you've done for me... and for you!"</p> <p>"You didn't need to thank me. I think you did more for me than I thought possible, and that was because of everything you said today. I have to say, I enjoyed listening to some of my questions! I've really enjoyed listening to you talk about your experiences for the first time, and I think I could use some practice!"</p> <p>"OK—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
