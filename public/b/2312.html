Please forgive me, this is so embarrassing!" he stammered.</p> <p>"Let me get you something to drink, sir." She said, handing him the drink. "I'll wait for the bus in the next carriage".</p> <p>She sat down on the floor beside him. "Now, how about a quickie now?" she asked.</p> <p>"A quickie? No, this is about being respectful and caring and caring and... oh... um, being sure that you're okay." He said nervously.</p> <p>"My place?" she asked, her voice sounding much too calm.</p> <p>"Yes, Miss. There's no need for you to be naked in the corridor, if you don't want to." He sounded very unsure about this.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm fine with it sir. I think that everyone's aware of my nudity. It's OK." She answered, her voice very calm and almost nonchalant.</p> <p>"Thank you. I'm just a little embarrassed. Let me get my trousers off and I'll take an aspirin." he said, almost apologetically.</p> <p>She pulled on his trousers quickly, removing them and his boxers and leaving them around his ankles, revealing his hard, throbbing penis. Her hand touched his penis and made it twitch in her hand.</p> <p>"This is so silly. I'm not supposed to touch anyone, especially you. You shouldn't be naked, this is my office! Please, don't be so bold!" He pleaded.</p> <p>She smiled and took his penis in her hand in her soft hand. He gasped when he felt that gentle touch. He started to relax as she worked the head of his penis with some effort. He sighed and closed his eyes.</p> <p>"That's it... I don't want you to cum!" she cooed. "Just let it lie there, it's all right now. It'll be OK with me."</p> <p>She rubbed the full head, her thumb on the underside, massaging the skin there. She was obviously enjoying himself, he could feel his penis responding and responding to the hand on it. "Oh, that's nice." he said softly, trying to catch his breath.</p> <p>"And how come you can't touch me down there, I don't have to feel you? It's OK." she said, looking at him intently. "This is what you were talking about!" She said firmly, squeezing him very close to her, her warm hand rubbing his entire soft skin.</p> <p>"Yes, Miss." he said, barely audible and not understanding exactly how this might be affecting him.</p> <p>"I feel good, too, and you do feel very good, sir. Please keep squeezing me, it feels really good." She responded gently.</p> <p>"I should certainly help you, Miss," he said with a smile. Her hand was still on top of his.</p> <p>She smiled back and said, "This is a lot bigger than I thought Sir. Maybe I should just let a little more, like let you feel my breasts?" she said, pulling him down on top of her.</p> <p>He didn't know what to do but as she moved them apart he felt free to move lower until he felt her breast rubbing his erection.</p> <p>"Oh yes, that feels real good!" he said.</p> <p>She squeezed him gently and said, "And you are so hard and warm!"</p> <p>"It's a nice soft touch, Miss." He replied. He couldn't believe it, but this woman seemed to want him to take charge.</p> <p>She let him lower his mouth on hers. As he neared his target they met in a deep, passionate kiss. She took control, opening her mouth wider and parting her lips slightly in response to his lips. Her tongue gently probed with his and he let out a moan. He took control.</p> <p>"Oh, my!" he said, breaking their kiss for air. He opened his mouth and let her tongue caress his own. He lapped her tongue and licked her teeth, then his lips to her lower lip, teasing her. She was responding to his efforts more eagerly than he had previously suspected.</p> <p>"Please, let me do this for you, sir." She said, smiling at him.</p> <p>"You don't have to do that!" he said. "I mean, I'm really sensitive right now! I think you're very pretty and very lovely and..."</p> <p>"Let me, just... let me do this to you. I like this!" she said, moving lower to kiss his cheek and then his lips again. She had a lovely tongue to tease him with. His penis was rock hard and throbbing.</p> <p>She smiled at himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
