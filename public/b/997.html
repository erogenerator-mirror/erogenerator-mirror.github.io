"I'm not going to go and leave the house either."</p> <p>"I'm sure it'll take me less than 20-30 minutes to get back in there, and I don't think you will either," he smiled.</p> <p>"Oh my god," I said to myself, "What do I do now?" I thought, he'd probably already moved back to where he stood sitting, but if he didn't know this is my house I doubt anyone would question it. So, instead, I leaned closer to him and put one of my arms around his neck, leaned forward, and put my cheek right on top of his. Then, gently pressing my lips to his, I kissed the corner of his mouth which sent a chill through his body which only increased my excitement. Once in a while, I could feel his cock grow under his pants, it felt so sexy to be laying in his arms and being pressed up against some other guy. It seemed to get the biggest surprise for me.</p> <p>"That was so nice," we said as we once again leaned together.</p> <p>"Yeah, it was," he said. "But maybe we need to get a bathroom first...I don't think I even remember the last time I've been in one." As we spoke the words, I let my fingertips slide over the top of his pants.</p> <p>"Well, let's not waste those," I said smiling at him knowingly as I felt his cock through his pants, not so much because of anything the way he was sitting but more because of the way he was sitting, leaning back and leaning his head back. He was so tall, we really were sitting in his chair, and it kind of felt like a couch for me, but we both had our arms around the other and I loved it.</p> <p>"Well, we sure did have some fun." He said a bit shyly as he looked from me to my own cock that was beginning to get hard again despite the fact that my panties were soaked in anticipation of how it would be to finally make love with another guy.</p> <p>"Oh yeah, it was soooo cool," I said with a smile. "I always wanted to, you know, kiss a guy."</p> <p>"Yeah, well, it's only fair that you get to kiss and suck a guy too."</p> <p>"You wouldn't."</p> <p>"I wouldn't what?" he asked, obviously not knowing what to say.</p> <p>"Well, if it wasn't our first time, I guess it shouldn't be anything you don't want to do. So, let's leave those on for now." So of course, we did, and the only way off is to take a shower. We got out of bed and went to the bathroom, he stepped in first while I took the other. At first, he couldn't get the water temperature right because of his water temperature, because he was still sitting in this strange chair. However, I think he was excited because his cock was swelling again. So, I led him to the shower and we stood in the shower as the warm steam filled our area. We both got extremely turned on as we started to rub each other up and down; we were so turned on just standing there. His hard cock was now protruding out between our bodies as he began to soap up my breasts, one by my left and then the other. As I let his hands continue to rub all over me, I was so turned on by the fact that our hands were almost touching each other now. We were both so horny though, but were still enjoying the opportunity to touch the other.</p> <p>He kissed me hard, and I started to kiss back...and it felt so good, just standing in the shower with him, one of his hands now in mine; the other behind me; cupping my breast from behind. His other hand had now explored my ass from my thigh to my hips and back again, and I was so turned on by his touches. I knew that it wouldn't be long at all for us to reach the goal we had set.</p> <p>"Oh, god, yes...that feels so good," I cried out as I wrapped my arms around his neck and brought our mouths closer together once again, our tongues meeting briefly with only one last time.</p> <p>"Don't worry," he whispered, "You won't get to fuck me until you feel how hard it's making me."</p> <p>"Oh yes, that's exactly what I'd like to do," I said. "I think now is a good timeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
