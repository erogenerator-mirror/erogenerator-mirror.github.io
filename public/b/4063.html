"I've already told your mom that I'm leaving your folks for another woman and I won't be back for five more days. I'm taking a year off, not wanting to start now."</p> <p>My mom was a little startled. My dad always insisted on paying my dad, so I guess I was getting my fair share of overtime, and it was going to be hard to make ends meet when I got stuck trying to find a new woman. That would have to wait. I knew my dad didn't think that way.</p> <p>"Well, I suppose we can have the weekend away." she added. She seemed relieved again. Then she noticed my mom looked like she was about to say something and went to get her wallet. My wife walked over and pulled her arm.</p> <p>"You really shouldn't be out here alone." she said. "That guy you saw looking at the house last night had to be at an auto show in my neighborhood." the older blonde said.</p> <p>I got up and walked over to her. "Well, he was nice." I said. "Didn't you see him?"</p> <p>"No dear. I saw him, but I can't see him." She replied.</p> <p>"Oh. That's because you have to be afraid of him." I said.</p> <p>"I hope he won't do anything." She said.</p> <p>"You'd best try." I replied. "It's not going to bother you if things don't work out. I love you." I replied.</p> <p>I stood in front of my mom.</p> <p>"Ok dear." my wife agreed.</p> <p>She took my hand. "I can't believe you're just going to go and make excuses. Are you ok?" she asked.</p> <p>I looked at her. "Well, sort of. It's just the same. Maybe it's just the same. I guess I can't really tell you much more right now. There's that, or I'm going to go and fuck my mother. Whatever it is." I said.</p> <p>I got back up and got my wallet. I walked over to my mom and put the money on the counter. She took my hands and squeezed them.</p> <p>I leaned forward and kissed her and said, "It's going to be ok. There's just the one thing we need to talk about, and I'm not going to do it over the phone."</p> <p>She smiled at me. As soon as she did that she took my hand and walked over to where my dad was waiting for me. I noticed that my dad was still a little nervous as that night unfolded. I don't think he expected for me to be doing this with my mom anyway. She came over and kissed me on the cheek.</p> <p>I turned around and looked at my mom. "I'm sorry." I said. She smiled. There was only one way to go. "I guess I'll have to talk to my dad again." she suggested.</p> <p>"Ok. I think you'll be ok." I responded.</p> <p>"Well, maybe we can try to talk about it." she smiled again and left.</p> <p></p> <p>Chapter 6</p> <p>I was getting pretty hungry. There were a number of things I wanted to tell Jenny. There's going to be a couple of weeks that we'll really talk about, but a couple of weeks is probably as long as I want it to lastâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
