I joked.</p> <p>"Oh, do you have plans for us then?" he asked curiously, but the question didn't register with me. It had taken me a while to realise what was happening to me, to realize that I liked what was going on. I loved my boyfriend, but not like this. It was an obsession that I didn't want to admit.</p> <p>"Yes, I've got two new roommates waiting to get married and that's just as well, I suppose." I told him. I leaned close to his ear whispering "I wish I was there to hold your hand, and kiss the tears of regret they pour on you."</p> <p>"Do I need to be told?" he asked, but I think he actually meant it, and he turned his face into my neck as I moved him slightly toward the floor. I felt weak as he held onto me with a hand that I did not want to be separated from. I felt the blood rush to my face again as I heard him sigh "You won't mind, I'll hold on for you". He slowly bent a little lower to whisper the words in my ear. When their lips touched I felt a rush go through me. It made me feel wanted, special. I didn't see a thing; but as I stood up I felt my eyes fill with tears, his eyes and that warm breath and it made my breath draw in a little.</p> <p>I don't know when I had made the decision that I wanted to keep my relationship with my boyfriend, it had been a good choice and if I had to have it I would live it. There were a few other things I liked about myself. They may have shown but they were in a different context to the relationships I had before me. The first was that I enjoyed the things they did to me, while the things you do to me are a mystery to me and not to be explored.</p> <p>I was not thinking of the other things that I liked when my boyfriend gave me the lift home. I was thinking of how good his eyes looked as I made my way up the steps. I felt it every time he looked at me and every time his eyebrows went up. He was not looking at me in that way that I liked but as a girl we would often see eyes on us. That's where I could go to, or say goodbye to him, I don't know but if I could, I would like to.</p> <p>I had to know more about myself. I had to know what was wrong with me, what was making me feel that way so I could work through it. I did not know for sure whether a man in my life could be this way or not. I needed to know where I stood with relationships when I was in a male dominated place. I did not want to think that anything I did was a decision, it was for the unknown, not for myself. I just wanted to know better, if there was anyone, anyone with whom I could confide. I wanted to be honest and to know what I had learned.</p> <p>As we walked back up the stairs to my apartment I could not help my curiosity. Would I be able to meet this man? If he saw me, he wouldn't want me to be a stranger in every sense, could he? He was so handsome, so caring, and he was always so sweet and caring. I wanted his lips pressed against mine. I wanted him to put their lips where his hand had been, and the kisses where they belonged. I wanted that man to kiss me all over. I wanted that kiss. I wanted to kiss every part of him I could reach with that mouth, and the smell and taste and smell and texture of his lips on mine was more than I could stand. I wanted to touch him and feel all at the same time. I wanted that man in my arms to take me in his arms and take me. I knew I was never going to want to have that moment of truth with a man so I just wanted to feel it once I was in his arms.</p> <p>Once we had gotten to my apartment I was just so nervous. I didn't know if I wanted to go this fast, or slowly. I wanted to find out more about what he was like. I wanted to know as much about his personality as he had any experience in that field. I wanted more than that.</p> <p>I felt his hand slip from my shoulder to slide over my arm just as the lift door opened. A slight smile touched his lips and he let go of mine. I felt his hand move to the side of my neck, and his fingers just under my breasts, feeling me up. It made me feel like his hands were all over me. I wondered if he liked what he felt when we kissed, if he wanted the things we do and I wanted the things we would do together, but his hand went down my arm and brushedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
