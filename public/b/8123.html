It's been a while," she said.</p> <p>"No...I mean...I know you're going to have to see the doctor, but it'll be okay."</p> <p>"Okay," she replied. "But I have to tell you, you've got a lot to think about. I'm sorry I can't stay here with you, but I love talking to you," she said. She stood up, turned around and started to walk away. "Come on you, honey. We'll talk some more about it at dinner. If you want to keep your end of our deal." With that, she turned and headed back down the road.</p> <p>As soon as she turned the corner, I got out of my car, walked to the door, and leaned against the door with my head down and palms sweating, thinking, "What the fuck? What the fuck am I doing?"</p> <p>I felt more confused, but it didn't really concern me the least. My wife of thirty years was my best friend and friend's girlfriend. But I hadn't considered the implications of it.</p> <p>When I opened the door and saw her standing only a few feet away, I let out a long laugh and said, "What is wrong with you? You're making a huge mistake."</p> <p>Before I could finish, she continued to look at me, so I reached out and grabbed her again and held her in my arms.</p> <p>"Honey," I said firmly. "I don't think that's the time or the place or the place. What the fuck do you think I'm doing here? If you let me go now, I'll never say anything like this again, okay? I promise. You need to be honest with me and open up to me. Otherwise I may hurt you and you might never feel so comfortable again."</p> <p>"Oh, Jesus," she said in a voice that was barely more than a whisper. I felt like I was going to throw up. I wanted to take my time.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she said, "I really am, but I just feel so ashamed of myself."</p> <p>"Honey, trust me. It's true. If you can't trust me, then I'm not sure I understand. But trust me anyway. I won't make you do anything you don't want to do if you don't want to."</p> <p>She looked a bit worried now, and I was getting worried myself.</p> <p>"Honey, don't worry. I understand what you're going through. I just want to make it special for both of us. It will come down to that. Okay?"</p> <p>"Okay," she said, "And I promise I'll never feel embarrassed. Okay?"</p> <p>I pulled her to me and we kissed at the doorstep and embraced in the front door. For an instant I couldn't believe it, I was hugging my best friend, kissing her the way she loved. I loved it too. As I pulled back, I felt a strong, positive, and very real and profound feeling.</p> <p>"I love you, too," she said, "but I've been thinking, for a while, that somehow I might need to stop being jealous and to put a damper on my feelings. I might have feelings for you and you might be attracted to me, but if we just give a little more thinking to some one else, I think we'll find that we can actually...get closer, maybe even to be able to get away from each other."</p> <p>She smiled into my eyes and replied, "Okay. Okay. That's one of the things I'm sure of right now."</p> <p>"Honey?" she said, "are you okay?</p> <p>"I'm going to get out of that stuff and walk back to my car and I have some things to tell you. I got some things from my doctor."</p> <p>"Okay" we both said at the same time, and then I went and had a quick shower to finish my business.</p> <p>"Honey, I've been thinking all day. Maybe I should go and get some lunch in before I talk to people."</p> <p>We hadn't heard from her for a while, and I knew she had to go anyway.</p> <p>After getting a big lunch on the way home, I called my buddy Bill, who happened to be my best friend's boss and fellow co-worker, and told him all about what I had just asked her about. Bill was very excited. I told him all about how she had felt, what she said when she found that she couldn't say no to me because I had been so close to her, even after all these years.</p> <p>When I was done, I called and said I'd be over in an hour. We were talking more about my "surprised" she had come into our roomâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
