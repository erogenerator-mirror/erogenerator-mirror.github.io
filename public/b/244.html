"Don't forget to finish cooking," I said, and turned to leave.</p> <p>I was halfway to the door, when I heard it.</p> <p>"I'm doing the same thing tomorrow, I can't tell you how much!" Mary yelled. "You should go! It's the first day of the new year," she said, and stomped off to leave.</p> <p>I closed the door, went to the TV and turned off my TV. Then I grabbed a coffee and went off to work.</p> <p>After a week of that, I was glad to be home. The house was empty except for me; I had a key to my house and was out for a long day.</p> <p>Walking across the street at 3:05, my cell phone went off. It was a text from Mary.</p> <p>"Honey, I'm going to get out of town and start a job tomorrow. Are you coming with me or not?" she wrote.</p> <p>"I'll be here. Are you coming home?"</p> <p>"Yep."</p> <p>I took my suitcase and my bag. My home office was on an opposite side of the house and it had a guest bedroom. The guest bedroom was on the other side of the house from the master bedroom to my office. The guest bedroom had a large bath with a Jacuzzi tub and shower. I thought it was pretty neat, and hoped it would be mine when I left town for good.</p> <p>I got my suitcase out of the trunk and made my way to my house. I knocked with a smile. I was just getting ready to start a new job; I might just be in town a week and a half.</p> <p>My cell phone rang and I answered.</p> <p>It was Mary.</p> <p>"What's your schedule doing?" she asked, almost innocently.</p> <p>"Just getting ready to leave. So do you want to go to lunch again tonight?" I asked.</p> <p>"Sure. What time and where?"</p> <p>"2:00," I typed back.</p> <p>"Can you drop off my overnight bag at the store please?"</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>"Can I pick you up first at 2:00?</p> <p>"I'll wait for you at the door."</p> <p>"Good night."</p> <p>I heard my wife say, "Good night." I then put my suitcase in the truck and followed her to the garage door. Mary opened the garage door and the door behind me. I pulled out as Mary stepped outside. I noticed a man's gray, button-down shirt over his dark, tanned torso. He had his left arm around his partner's waist. Both women stood in the doorway to the garage. I noticed I hadn't seen my wife's bra and panties. The man had his right hand between the woman's legs. I could not see her face clearly, but she had her eyes on him looking at her.</p> <p>I pulled into the parking garage and Mary and the woman stepped into the car. I was sure to watch as they got out of the car and then got in and buckled into their seats.</p> <p>I opened the passenger door and watched as my two women and the man got out of the truck. Mary handed me my suitcase and headed to the door, and when she opened it, they both followed her. I followed them to the back of the garage. The man opened Mary's door for her and she stepped forward. I went to the passenger side and got in. The couple got in the truck and started it.</p> <p>I watched with anticipation as they backed out, backed out of the garage, and headed to the store.</p> <p>"We'll be by your house at 2:00, right?" I typed.</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>"Oh, and I still have to get ready."</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>Mary handed me the bag. I put my hand right into hers. She responded. I pulled away and walked her as she turned off the truck. She was shaking and I started the truck.</p> <p>"No problem," I typed, "I'll be right here."</p> <p>Mary got out of the cab, ran into the house, and then I followed right in. We walked to the front door.</p> <p>We walked to the door, opened it, and stepped inside. Mary pulled me into the kitchen, where she kissed me passionately. "Good night," she said, and then kissed her way out of the kitchen.</p> <p>"Good morning," I typed, "Good morning."</p> <p>I turned into the kitchen and entered the bedroom. I could see the light was on, because I am sure you could see my hands moving around slowly, as I undressed.
