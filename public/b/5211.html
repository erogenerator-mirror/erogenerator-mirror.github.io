She said, a little hurt, I had just fucked my daughter and now just a little girl was touching my dick with the head and I'd lost control.</p> <p>"Yeah... I'm better at it than my sister does."</p> <p>"She was always good with hers." She added, with a wry smile.</p> <p>"She's a little... a little... slut." I said, the words coming out, they were not what I was hoping to say.</p> <p>"Oh... I see." She said, a smile breaking through the misery in her voice</p> <p>"Is she... is she a good cocksucker?" I asked, in disbelief. The thought of my daughter playing with my dick had turned me on just as much as her saying something similar, I wasn't sure if it was me, but it did feel nice. I wasn't going to push the issue, my daughter was my daughter.</p> <p>"Oh... I don't know. It's been her whole life and... well you know." She said as she reached out and took my dick in her hand. "I can give one hell of a blow job, not to mention a pussy that you're lucky enough to have."</p> <p>"Ah... um... she's different. She's a sweet girl that I've always liked but..." I trailed off, and my erection was getting harder all the time.</p> <p>"She just got a great job here." She said, holding my dick, squeezing firmly.</p> <p>"Can you take a guess at the girls she's done? I mean..."</p> <p>"No, I mean... I guess she did good, but this is her first one." She said, pulling back so that my dick slid out of her hand.</p> <p>"I think she's got a pretty good start on it, don't you think?" I asked, not sure how to answer that. Should I go and see if that was true or not?</p> <p>"Yeah, she was really good, you have no idea, but... what? Did you have something else in mind?</p> <p>"It's really good, but I'm not sure if I should be telling you."</p> <p>"Why not? Are you in a bad mood? We don't have anything going on in the way of a good or bad marriage, I get it. I'm not saying that we should do this, but I could see that you probably felt you needed to change things." She said, rubbing my cock, a bit of drool slipping from her mouth onto my head.</p> <p>"Yeah, well my sister, she's really good, and if you didn't have a lot to drink she'd probably be fine with doing that." I said, trying to be supportive.</p> <p>"Really? Well, she never asks so I won't let you say you don't want to, I never make the habit of getting mixed up with someone like this." She said, looking up at me and smiling.</p> <p>"Well... I mean... maybe if we went there and you're not so uptight about it..." I said, pulling back on my pants, turning to get out of line, "I'm sure that you're not too worried about it, we can talk a little."</p> <p>"Yeah... well, if you're not uptight about it just tell me." She said, still smiling.</p> <p>"No, no... I mean, ok... I'm not uptight... I don't usually get out of my own way."</p> <p>"I'm very aware... I didn't mean anything by it." She said, but her eyes were serious, not asking permission.</p> <p>"Yeah... but... if you keep worrying about it." I said.</p> <p>"I'll keep my mouth shut, no need to worry." She replied, turning back to the customer.</p> <p>"So. What's your name?" I asked, giving her a friendly look.</p> <p>"Jillian." She said, leaning over to give me a quick kiss on the cheek.</p> <p>"Jillian." I said, and gave her a friendly kiss on the mouth again.</p> <p>"So. How have you been? The usual?" She asked, standing up, walking over to her register.</p> <p>"Fine, fine." I answered, putting my hands on the counter, and looked back to see what I meant. If she asked to see the number, it would be J-8, and if she really wanted to see the numbers... I liked it when she went into detail about the sales figures.</p> <p>"I hear that you're a girl now, but how are things?" She asked. I hadn't met Jillian yet, I wasn't going to say she was a girl either.</p> <p>"We're different." I answered, putting my hand on the counterâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
