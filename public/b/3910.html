I couldn't help it as I saw a girl come in just before classes were over. She stood up, waved at me and headed to the other end of the room, where a good looking blond guy would be sitting. She walked back over to the seat in front of me, which was already packed, and sat down, motioning for me to sit down. I did and she turned to the guy sitting next to her. "Hi," she said as she leaned to me and shook my hand. "And you look good too," she said as she looked me over from head to toe. This girl did look good and it was nice to get out of my skin after a day of hard work.</p> <p>"Thanks for inviting me out on my own today," I replied.</p> <p>"Well its alright. You can hang out in the back in just the right spot if you'd like to," she replied. I nodded my assent to the plan of mine and headed off to the back corner of the building and into my room. As I got to my door, which I opened without even thinking about it, I thought to myself that it had to be the best day yet as I was still in a funk.</p> <p>I got undressed and laid on my bed waiting for the evening to unfold. After about 10 minutes of just laying on my bed trying to make myself feel better, I heard the door open and a loud yell. I got up and quickly went to the door to see what the scream was all about.</p> <p>"What were you thinking?" a voice said as a hand went to my mouth, shushed it and said "Its alright if you're fine." The hand was shaken and not at all like I had expected. I looked down and there was a long string of saliva that hung down from the corner of the hand. I quickly put my palm over the spit covering it and got the spit off the spit in my hand. I continued to rub my spit into my hand and felt the hand loosen in my grip. The hand didn't budge at first and after a while, I pulled the hand away from my face and then moved it back down to my stomach.</p> <p>"I said it's alright, don't worry" I heard the teacher say the last thing I heard before I closed my eyes and threw my hands up in the air. "I know what it's like to be in situations like this," I heard the teacher say. "And I have some experience with this type of thing. This would seem too easy for me but, I promise, I'm not exactly a professional."</p> <p>"So, are you going to tell me to fuck off or is it just going to take a few more minutes?" I heard a voice say before I closed my eyes again. "Just let me see what I should do about this," she said as she pulled my hand to her lips and kissed the skin on the back of my hand. "So, what do I need to do?" she finished.</p> <p>"You'll just have to make do. I'll let you know in about 10 minutes. I'm at least 20 minutes away from my school so I just need to be able to look at you so I'm sure you've already seen most of me," I said as the teacher smiled and pushed my hand to her lips. "See?" she said with a smile as she kissed the skin on my hand. "Just think about it all you want," she said as she pulled my hand down to her mouth which she kissed just inches away from my hand.</p> <p>Before she could continue kissing my hand and I said, "Ok. I'll think about it," and I felt her lips kiss and suck on the skin on the back of my hand. My hands were rubbing my body as I was laying on my bed and couldn't help but smile. I heard a voice say "See? I think you've seen everything, huh?" the teacher said and closed my hand over her lips.</p> <p>"Ok. Here is what I am going to do then", she said and kissed my hand. "I'm going to tell you to start going back to that spot right now," she ordered softly as she kissed my hand again. "If you don't want me to take control of this situation that you should stop immediately. Just relax because you have already done what I asked. Then, we'll see if I'm able to get you to do what I asked. But before you go back here again, I don't want you to stay there like I asked, as it's going to be a lot more awkward for you. I want you to find that spot and follow the instructions," she said gently as she kissed my hand again.
