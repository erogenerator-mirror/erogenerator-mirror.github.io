This is what got us going. So we became your friends. In college, we shared a room to share with the guys in one of our sports teams. We took a few courses together and got good at being best friends. Eventually, we all got to do some of the "fucking," like sucking each other off in the bathroom or getting high in a private room. But none of that was what we wanted to do in that room at college. We wanted to share.</p> <p>I remember that night like it was yesterday. It was different, though. I think that's why it was different. It was more of the same thing. We were both so nervous about it. I think it might sound strange but I didn't want to admit that to you. You told me that we had to be quiet so no one else would hear if we got caught.</p> <p>I never thought we would do it like that. It was not that hard. We had been best friends forever.</p> <p>"Don't worry honey," I told you, then asked if you wanted me to get naked with the guys in the room. Did you want me to play with them? Did you want to go down on them? Did you think you could handle the whole thing? I really think you could.</p> <p>"No. Only if you want me to suck them again," was your only answer. That was my only reply.</p> <p>"OK, that's really OK. I'm not disappointed." I can't wait to do that again. You have got great hands. If you ever wanted to go down on a guy in the shower, you would too.</p> <p>You weren't that way at all, though. As it was. You had been doing everything I hadn't. I had had this talk with a few other guys on that night. We were getting very turned on at the thought of a guy's penis in your mouth. I had not even tried it and I think I didn't really know any of these guys. Then it came out that you were a virgin. Did he still have that cherry?</p> <p>When I was thinking about it, though, that's exactly what I did. Not wanting to freak you out, I tried a few things I found online. It was so easy, and it was like your first experience making love. You had told me you liked to suck guys, so why should I have to do that? Not that I really had much experience. I did enjoy the fact that you had sucked me off as well as a lot of other guys.</p> <p>But to me, that was very different. I have to admit, it was even better. I still can't believe how much better, or even as much as, that was with you afterwards. I guess you're right, in a sense. As I sat there, I was having a hard time taking my mind off the fact that we had just had the sex of a lifetime and probably should only be doing it once a week or so. It just didn't make it any easier to believe that the rest of our lives would be the same.</p> <p>You had also been doing some of the stuff you were doing that night. You told me you liked to be fucked, well, sort of. The word 'fuck' was the operative word. There was no other word other than that. There was also no other name other than fuck. But that was the extent of our relationship. I still didn't understand your definition exactly.</p> <p>For the past year I had wondered to myself if this was your first time to go down on a guy. I was more of of a 'boy' that you really were too, but also not a 'girl' either. I found it very hard to get comfortable with your experimentation. I had wondered if you would like to kiss a guy and get it over with. As I said, I know I was inexperienced, too, and I think some of your kissing experiences didn't come much later than I had, but we were both still so nervous about it, and there was only that one time in high school, at our college reunion, when the guy I thought I had loved kissed me.</p> <p>I was glad our dates were almost over. I remember you were so nervous I started to feel a tad guilty for not telling you the night before. I really had to work really hard to get you to think about what I asked you to do when we went to that party.</p> <p>"If it's okay, I'd love you to suck my cock for me, right in front of you, just as good as you did sucking him," your sweet, caring voice said the word.
