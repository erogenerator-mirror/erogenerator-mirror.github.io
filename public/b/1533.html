She replied with a small smirk as she looked around the small bedroom of the house with her hands. The walls, the ceiling and ceiling panels were all still lit up, even though her husband was probably passed out and passed out with his eyes closed. The bed was set up, and the walls were all covered in soft pink rose petals and a large rose head. The small bathroom was set up as well, full of sinks and a toilet, and a shower area with a large bath tub and a nice big stone tubtub full of water and hot tubs that she loved, and her husband was sleeping on the bed. The bathroom door was opened just a crack, and she could just see the bathroom light coming from the open door and the tub she was in. It was just like her childhood.</p> <p>"Mmm, what's this?" She said with a smile as she looked down at himself, and he was looking at it a little different.</p> <p>"Oh, just my birthday present." With that, the smile disappeared from her face and she turned to look at him again. "I got this for you." With that, she pulled him down on the bed. "Now it's my turn." She pulled his hand to her stomach, and began to pull her pants down. She started to do a little dance, as she pushed his hand down to her pussy. His fingers moved easily between her legs as her pants went around her ankles. He pulled it off, leaving himself standing above her, holding his hand and guiding it over her pussy. His hand moved up and around, stroking and caressing her as she pushed it against her pussy. His dick was standing straight out, hard and straight at the same time, throbbing with energy. Her skin was still damp from her orgasm, and her hands had been holding onto his thighs as she looked up at him. It had become clear that this was the part of her that was more aggressive in her fantasies and never wanted to stop. She pushed him back on his back, grabbed his dick and slowly slid herself onto it. They both let out simultaneous moans as she slid up and down on him.</p> <p>"God, you're bigger than your father, and he was an inch longer long and fat that I would give almost any one of these fantasies of mine." She had not had sex with a man the way this was feeling to her. And she was not disappointed. It almost felt like that was how it had made her feel just a few weeks or so before. "What a stud." She had said in her most seductive voice, and felt herself beginning to ride him on the edge. "I want your father to do as well." He was still moaning as she began to pick up speed. She moved her hands from his thighs up and onto his ass as she pulled herself up and down on his dick. His hand rested just below her breasts and he squeezed her nipples as his hips thrust himself upwards to meet her down stroke. He grabbed her by the back of her head, and pushed it down into her shoulder blade.</p> <p>"Yes, baby.... Oh God...." He let out a bit of a breath as she pulled on him.</p> <p>"Yeah, baby, yes, that's.... Oh yeah..." She said back to him, as she began to really move on him with her hands. She felt very intense pleasure that rushed into her as her hands came to the level of her breasts. Her whole body was shaking out of control as she pushed herself as hard and as far up on his dick as she could go. He grabbed her breasts with his hands as his hips thrust up to meet her down stroke. The sounds of their bodies slapping against each other could be heard by just the soft sound of their skin hitting. Their bodies were coming to climax again and again. He looked up at her face, and she was really enjoying herself now. Her mouth was half open, and she was staring in ecstasy. He grabbed her breasts with his hands, and began to squeeze as hard as he possibly could. Her breasts began to throb and roll in his hands as she continued to move up and down on his cock. She leaned in to kiss him again and he held onto her tight. She felt his hot kisses all over her face, neck, arms and shoulders. She moaned as this man, her husband had only known her once now, but she could tell from the moans and movements on his cock that he was starting to also.</p> <p>"Baby..." Her husband whispered to her, "I want you.... Let's go on for the night." She knew he was referring to her having another climax with him, and she knew her husband was just about to have one himself. He smiled at her. "We should get you cleaned up before we go on."</p> <p>"That's ok, baby," She said back to him, "I want to feel a dick in my pussyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
