I've got such a thing. I can't help it!"</p> <p>My voice quivered, my breathing quickening. I watched his eyes, as if looking at a picture in their reflection. His tongue flicked from his upper lip down to his lower lip, which he slowly and lightly brushed with the tip, causing him to moan slightly.</p> <p>"So.. are we...?"</p> <p>"Almost done with my story. Do you want to hear it?"</p> <p>"I'd love to hear it." He slid his hands around to the base of the tree, where he gripped it hard, his fingertips digging into the flesh. His eyes closed briefly, his mouth opening and closing to a soundless gasp. He released it again, holding his breath as he did so. It took a minute before his arms relaxed in preparation for something more. His fingertips continued to glide up and down, almost touching, until the tip of his index finger rested against the tip of his cock. His eyes opened and a lazy smile appeared. "You're the man that said it."</p> <p>"That's for sure. But you just said the right thing." His eyes returned to the tree, and he began to move his hand once again. As he moved his finger down his cock, he closed his eyes. A moment later, he was at the base, just at his eyes. He took hold of it, and slowly slid his fingers up and down, causing him to moan. The sensation was just too good, and the mere touch was enough to bring him back to the peak. He closed his eyes as he continued to move his finger up and down, in rhythm to his other hand.</p> <p>As he became more intense in the movements of his hand, it was almost as if, as if, there was no other place he wanted to be. He wanted her, and there was no other place he wanted her to be. Even when he thought of her as a young girl, it was like they were meant only for each other. The thought made him groan and he began to massage himself against his own finger.</p> <p>"Yesss...that feels so good...yes...yes..."</p> <p>His own hand became more demanding as his hips swayed, rubbing against it. His finger began to speed up, and he knew he wouldn't last much longer. His hips began to buck as his hand sped up so rapidly in its motion, his grip tightening in his fist.</p> <p>"Ohhhh...I'm going to come...ohhh yesssss...I'm gonna come...yessssssss...that's it...yes...there you...yessss...just like that." He let his hips grind back against the tree, but held onto his balls to stave off his release. He was amazed how powerful his hand was, yet he knew how good it was for him also. The fact that he was almost done, caused him to want more and more...to let go. He let his hips rock more violently, grinding against the tree.</p> <p>"I'm still coming...Yessss...ohhhhh yessss..." He began to arch his back, and his ass pushed in against the tree, trying to give them both what they wanted.</p> <p>"Yesssssss." He felt his whole body tighten, and knew he was about to come. He let his hips remain still, fighting the urge to move as his dick began to spurt the thick, hot sperm against the tree's bark. It didn't take much more at all before he felt his legs starting to shake as his hand was nearly completely pulled out from the base of his cock, and his arms gave out. He fell on his butt, gasping for air, letting the orgasm that had taken him as far away, as it could.</p> <p>The wind knocked over him as he collapsed against the tree, as far away as he would go, as the moon cast it's shadow across the ground. He opened his eyes, looking down at his body, his hand gripping the tree.</p> <p>"That was amazing." He looked up at him and slowly started to move his own hand. His eyes were still closed; he didn't see how he could have possibly held his self there for so long anyway. He felt his own fingers curl back in their own position. His hand began to move faster again, and he thought he heard an occasional sound of pleasure coming from somewhere. He watched the moon move away from the tree's branches, and the soft glow of the moon cast its light upon his body.</p> <p>"You're amazing..."</p> <p>"Uh huh huh." He lifted his body upright, his arm still gripping the tree. His body trembled as he began to run his fingersâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
