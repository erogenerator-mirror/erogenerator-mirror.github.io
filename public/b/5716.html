Maybe the night is a little off tonight.”</p> <p>“Maybe, I’ll see you in the morning.”</p> <p>“We’ll talk about it, okay,” her face changed into a huge grin.</p> <p>I turned and headed my way. They had already gone to bed. It took me at least twenty minutes to find them. We shook hands, made small talk, and headed out.</p> <p>I started in the door. “I’ll let you know about the new rule.”</p> <p>It’s one of the hardest rules ever. I looked around, then said, “There is no reason to have you walk through it.” I walked quickly out to my truck with my arm across my chest and my face just inches from hers.</p> <p>“Do you need to talk to anyone about this?” She was looking at me. “I think it is better this way than you can get out of it.” She was staring right at me as I pulled away. She was the last one there tonight. If anyone showed up, they were dead.</p> <p>I took a little control over the situation, and started the truck. She looked around a little nervously at her friends. “Honey, we’re fine tonight.” She said softly. He only smiled a little sheepishly at me.</p> <p>We headed to the hotel in silence. I went into the room as she walked upstairs. As I entered, she threw herself at me and our arms went around each other. We kissed deeply as our hands roamed wildly. We broke our embrace long enough to strip off each other’s clothes, and then we were on our knees, kissing my way down her body.</p> <p>When I reached her pussy, she opened that pussy as much as I could. I began by sucking her clit. I’m not particularly good at eating pussy, but she was so hot that her pussy was dripping already. My dick was so hard that it hurt as I tried to position it at her entrance. She seemed to get even more in the mood because as much as I wanted to pound her, I knew she wasn’t going to stop me.</p> <p>She pushed me away and pushed me over against the bed. I lay there on my back as she bent over and began kissing her way down my body. Again, I was very nervous. Her hands were on either side of my hips as she moved her body closer to my dick. Slowly, she went down her tongue reaching the base of my dick as I tried to thrust in her throat. When she got there, she moved her mouth up to the tip of my dick, and began to lick. “Oh, this is nice.” I said.</p> <p>“My mouth needs more room.” She said as she moved down one more time, taking my cock almost into her mouth, and then took me back in. She took her time, slowly, deliberately. When I could’t take it anymore, I raised my hips in time with her movements. She took my dick back into her mouth and stroked me with her hand.</p> <p>She worked to bring me closer and closer to the edge while never letting me come. She was driving me crazy, and my mouth was dry. I had to be on the brink of coming as hard as I’d ever been in my life. My dick was as hard as nails, and her mouth was taking me deeper and deeper into her.</p> <p>I couldn’t hold it any more and began to come so hard, and I began to buck and buck. She tried to keep my dick buried, but only succeeded in making me squirt my load into her mouth and on her face. She let me finish, and then licked my dick a few more times. She rose up and began licking her fingers clean as she sat down on my chest. She kissed my lips and licked them while I still lay there holding her.</p> <p>I rolled over and kissed her again. We separated, and I said, “Thank you.” To which she just smiled and said, “I love you, and thank you, too.” She kissed her way down my body until she got to my dick. Before looking back up at me, she began to lick the tip of it, which sent my dick into overdrive.</p> <p>Her tongue danced around the tip for a half an hour until my dick was throbbing.</p> <p>She stood up on the bed and crawled—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
