I put my hands on her hips and gently rocked her back against me as we kissed. I held and stroked her naked flesh as we embraced and my cock pressed against hers as it had been pressing against the inside of the small of her back.</p> <p>We kissed for many minutes and I could feel her beginning to quiver. I whispered for her to "give me a show here." As she lowered herself onto the back of the sofa I looked down at her as she slowly slid her leg underneath mine. My cock was beginning to press against the inside of her leg, making an obvious point of getting harder and making us both moan.</p> <p>She lifted herself off the sofa to let it drop back to rest between her legs. She spread them wide and I could see the pink cleft of her womanhood as she began a slow rocking motion. Her body started to quiver as she started to cum and I was feeling her muscles begin to spasm as well. She continued to ride me slowly but rhythmically until she calmed down and we were just kissing again.</p> <p>"Wow, we are not done yet. You must have thought we were just kissing and you were really excited about our experience but we had no intention of having intercourse until we were completely satisfied."</p> <p>"Mmmm that was incredible. I never thought about it that way before. Please do more to me with your tongue or finger if you think we should. Maybe I should just try to suck your cock now."</p> <p>"That sounds good to me. But I have other plans."</p> <p>She smiled and pulled her robe over her head. She reached back and ran her fingers through her hair as she undressed herself. I got the idea and put the movie into the DVD player. It was still too dark when she climbed back onto the sofa. I got up and stood between her legs to place my cock in her. She took a step back just for the fuck and I pushed forward and slid into her.</p> <p>It had been three years since anyone had taken me into their body and yet she just seemed so right. It was better than sex with any of the guys. We fucked slowly. I was trying to be as gentle as possible. I knew I couldn't go on forever but just as I had been with Mike, I knew time would run out. She wrapped her arms around me and we kissed before I told her to get off the sofa before I had another accident.</p> <p>In the back of my brain I wondered if she knew she was in an unfamiliar part of the world and that she shouldn't feel too weird. That was all the guilt I needed to realize the whole situation had changed. Now that she had experienced sex with a stranger, she was ready and willing to have any and all kind of sexual experience. It was like a moment in time that had nothing to do with our relationship but had everything to do with the sex she had known with Mike. I felt her shudder as the thought came to me. We fucked, we fucked, I told her that I was ready and ready to cum any time now.</p> <p>I felt cum begin to rise in my balls and she was going to cum with me. Then I felt the contraction and pulsation as the semen began to rise and surge from my balls. The feeling was indescribable. As I began to pull out of her I said, "I am about to cum. It's OK to cum if you want but not to do it in front of everyone."</p> <p>"OK. But hurry and fuck me, I am so wet and ready." We fucked like two teenagers in the woods, taking our sweet time in getting off. In the end I felt the tension begin to subside and I got off her and she got up slowly and walked naked over to the dresser. When she returned I was still holding her. I had no idea what she was going to do next.</p> <p>She looked around the room and asked, "Aren't there any vibrators in there?" The first thing I thought was "no. Why would she want vibrators there?"</p> <p>"There are no more surprises. As long as there can be ones in here, there are no more surprises."</p> <p>"OK."</p> <p>She took a box and opened it. Inside the box was a variety of different types of vibrators. I wondered if this was what was going to happen. Then I knew. What did she want me to do on this night. She said to "accidentally" pick up another vibrator. She brought it over and I went to pick up a new one. She took a good hold on my shoulders to stabilize herself as she lowered herself onto me so that she was fully impaled. The feeling of my cock being inside her was indescribable. I could have died with this being the first time aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
