I said. The girl got up off my lap and straddled the bench between us. "God, I was really sorry that thing hit me." The poor girl was still sitting with her hands covering her face. She gave me a little more to hold onto. She looked at me and said something in between sips of beer. The guy looked at me and said something, I think he tried to tell me something else. I just looked at him.</p> <p>Then again, I wasn't sure what was happening here. There was just a little bit of a spark in the moment, I wasn't sure which was more scary the fact that she seemed a whole lot closer to me than earlier before.</p> <p>The girl said something else and we all shook our heads. I think the other three were all confused at that point. The other two girl's faces seemed to say something else too. Then the third girl stood up, looking around the room at us. There was one other big smile on her face when she saw how serious the other girls were being. Then another one of the girls came over. "Hey guys, I'm Becky. I'm not sure this could work, but I have to say that we're willing to offer you guys...or at the very least me." The other three girls all grinned. "What if they don't understand what's going on?" I said. The other girl stood her ground, "We all know you two think you're mad at me, but you look like you really need this."</p> <p>We agreed to their offer. They walked over to us and the guy stood up. Becky took him by the hand and they came over to the table in the front.</p> <p>"We can talk more about it later, OK?"</p> <p>"Sure. I really want to get out of here before it becomes too serious."</p> <p>The girl said something else to the other girl's face and they walked off the stage. The whole room was full of other guys in the hallways, and it looked to be mostly empty so they just walked past.</p> <p>"You guys were asking me how I could do this?" A tall guy said.</p> <p>"Well, I think you already had a lot of questions about our deal."</p> <p>"Well, you could ask me if I could, we really can't turn you down." The girl laughed."</p> <p>"Sorry, I was just so excited. I've been waiting for it, I just don't think that it would be right. I mean, it just feels like the last couple of weeks of a relationship that I've been with people I really kind of felt like I could be something really bad. If they didn't like me, maybe I got stuck in a situation that would make me feel weird."</p> <p>The guy said, "Well, I'm not so sure, but it seems kind of cool that you're trying to do this."</p> <p>"We're not sure why we're doing this, it hasn't even begun yet."</p> <p>The girl, who had not yet seen the guy, was standing behind him and smiling a big wet smile and I could see she was still smiling.</p> <p>"So you guys like the idea of us going down on you, can you give me the answer?"</p> <p>"Well...Yeah, I guess we're both kind of up for it."</p> <p>The guy said something else and we all looked at him.</p> <p>"Are you guys okay with this? I mean, I know we could have...um...um...uh..." He put his head back in his hands and sighed. Then he said something, a big laugh came from his lips. The girls all laughed at that also, a very long laugh came from the guy.</p> <p>"Come on, what happens here stays here, so are you guys okay with all of us just doing this?" He asked.</p> <p>We all shook our head no, but we were all still smiling and the guy shook his head. We all started walking toward the line of people standing at the next exit. There were people all around us now, and we stopped at the bottom of the long line. Becky got a few feet down a guy in a skirt stood up and began talking.</p> <p>"So, what's your name?" Becky asked.</p> <p>"I don't know, I guess I just know you."</p> <p>"Do you mean that you're my...uh..boyfriend?"</p> <p>"Well, I don't think that's really what I meant."</p> <p>The guy's face was still smiling. Becky said something else to the guy behind him. The whole line of guys got louder, a few of the girls were getting closer. I think about fifteen guys got close enough to get closer to the guy sitting down. I saw a couple of girls were getting closer, and they were rubbing their faces on his back.
