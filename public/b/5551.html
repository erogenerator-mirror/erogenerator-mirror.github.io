I teased.</p> <p>"I'm glad I haven't been found out," she smiled back, her fingers gently playing with my cock. "I didn't think it was possible, but I've always wanted to find out."</p> <p>When my face flushed, she looked down and smiled at me through the mirror in front of her. "Well, I'm glad that it happened," she said with a smile, then turned again and began to undress.</p> <p>I got the sense from the tone of her voice and the way she seemed to be smiling at me, and I began to feel a stirring in my shorts.</p> <p>"I guess you're right, I had a crush on you when I first met you," she said as she undid her bra, pulling it out of her pants. "I was just teasing you," she added as she stood there in front of me, just as naked as she was.</p> <p>Her breasts looked amazing. They were perky and perfectly formed: full and round, not saggy like the rest of her - they just seemed to take on all the right forms as she stood there, looking sexy. She smiled and reached out her arms and pulled me toward her. My hands slowly drifted up to her boobs, first kneading first, then squeezing.</p> <p>"Oh, I love you," I said, as I gave her cleavage a gentle squeeze.</p> <p>"And I love you, too," she replied. "Just not as much as a boyfriend, right?"</p> <p>I laughed. "I guess we have all the time in the world then," I joked.</p> <p>We stood there in the dark staring at each other as our hands groped each other's bodies, touching and running over each other. She was definitely on the thinner side of a C cup - I'm not sure about the C-cup, but that seemed to help with the softness.</p> <p>I broke the embrace and dropped to my knees in front of her, placing my hands in the small of her back. I leaned forward and lightly kissed her exposed neck. Her hands started to roam my hair as her body relaxed and she purred with pleasure.</p> <p>"Oh, that's so nice," I softly moaned as my lips finally made contact with the skin just under the strap of her bra.</p> <p>She jumped a bit, but not too much. I kissed and licked the skin that had just been exposed, as my hands worked their way up and down her body. Her nipples seemed to get a little hard, and I could tell that she was enjoying it as she pulled me into her.</p> <p>"Oh," she whispered softly and ran her fingers through my hair as I gently tugged and sucked on her skin.</p> <p>I knew the effect this would have on her. Her nipples began to harden and I continued to gently nibble and kiss them as I pressed her body into mine. Our kiss grew more passionate and my mouth went from her neck to her earlobe. We kissed like that for a while until I finally kissed my way down her body until I was between her legs.</p> <p>"What, am I not going to be able to kiss you after tonight?" I asked, as she grabbed the back of my head and pushed it toward her.</p> <p>"I'm just having a little fun!" she said, as she thrust her pelvis up into my face. Her pussy was wet from the kissing, and I licked around for almost a minute before I pushed my tongue inside her. It was so warm and wet, and tasted really good: tangy and slightly sour at the same time. I could feel her lips quivering with pleasure, as she finally pushed me back onto my back and jumped up on top of me.</p> <p>"Ooh, are you sure you've never done that before, John?" she teased.</p> <p>"I'm sure as hell not complaining," I said as I placed my arms around her, feeling her warmth and weight against my bare chest.</p> <p>She smiled and sat down and kissed my lips again, this time pressing her thigh into my crotch. "Now I know why you never did it with me before," she said.</p> <p>"It's just that I knew we wouldn't be able to let go that easily," I replied. "Don't try to figure out how to stop it."</p> <p>She smiled again and leaned into me, her breasts hanging in my face while they lay against my cheeks. "Why not? It's been so long since we got to do that?" she said with a smile. "I'd love it if I could have you to myself any time."</p> <p>She slid her body down mine until she was straddling my thighs and then kissed me. I could taste my own arousal on herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
