She wanted to take off right then, so I did, and we went off the freeway. As we reached the freeway, we made a bit of a detour, before we drove on a right turn. The left turn gave a hint to what her destination point was for us. We had plenty of time to make my mind up before she got off.</p> <p>"So this is your dream? What was behind that cabin?" she asked</p> <p>"Well the reason really is that my dad is off somewhere and we thought we should come by and take advantage of the moment. But after I turned this off, did you know my parents have the cabin up near here?" she asked.</p> <p>"I can see them all over," and so we pulled up to the front of the house. "I just needed to know where she went because the cabin at the end of the garage leads into the back yard as far as the lake."</p> <p>"Oh! She's in the middle of this house!" she gasped. "She never leaves the lake," she said.</p> <p>"Then we'll find her," I said. "Why don't we get the truck pulled in and move the ladder up to the truck bed? We'll just put the truck back where it was. We'll have to walk up in back and pull out and pull in. Hopefully it could be just a little closer by the fire escape by the way."</p> <p>We walked in front of the cabin, to get the ladder. The ladder had been in the truck bed all the way up, when the ladder pulled into it, I saw that all the way. By that point, I was in the cab and she climbed right inside.</p> <p>She got out a few seconds later. She told me where she wanted me to climb from and take off in one of the back yards. That way it wouldn't be so awkward, she added.</p> <p>"The first time my dad was away from the house, she would come over to mine and spend a couple of hours exploring my body. I was the first one that would do that, it was only a matter of time before, I'm sure." She put her right arm around mine and pulled me into a hug.</p> <p>"Well now that we have some privacy for ourselves, and this time doesn't have anyone's eyes on us, how about giving me a quickie before we leave before it gets too late? What do you say?"</p> <p>We turned to look at each other again.</p> <p>"That sounds like fun," I responded. "We should do it."</p> <p>She leaned in to give me a kiss, "So are you ready?"</p> <p>"I think so," I answered.</p> <p>"We go into town and get a nice lunch and then we will talk," she answered, "if you're interested?"</p> <p>"Sure," I answered, "I'm game."</p> <p>I went back into the bedroom so she could get a good look and see where we went. When I turned around, she was standing in front of me. She was beautiful. She looked around for a moment then sat down, pulled her top off and straddled me. I reached forward and held her lovely breast in my hand, while I took a nipple in my mouth. She was wet. She took my head in her hands and guided my mouth away from her breast.</p> <p>"So now we have a good view of the back yard and the back door. Can we go back there or should we go in first?"</p> <p>"It looks like you like what you are seeing," I answered.</p> <p>"Well," she said, "we may have to go in first and then later I have to see everything. I don't care if we both just walk out from the house. We can check out at the house and see what happens or if we go back with them."</p> <p>She was right.</p> <p>I had not gone topless in front of her, but we found out how much fun the back yard and the end of the house can be. They had me go into the back patio where we could look out over the lake for a while before we went back inside. She came out with me in tow in about two minutes. We went back inside and got the ladder out.</p> <p>"What do you say?" She asked.</p> <p>"I think we should both stay there for a while," I said. "Just to be sure we stay on the other side of the pool."</p> <p>I walked her to the side of the patio, with me standing beside her. I kissed her, as she pulled back. We could have just looked out over the lake, but we didn't. This was a good opportunity to keep her naked for a while, and enjoy my cock inside her. I kissed her again, this time longer, and she opened her mouth for me.
