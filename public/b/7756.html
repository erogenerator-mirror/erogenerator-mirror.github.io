"Tell me to stop."</p> <p>"Ohhh....goddddddddd...." My voice had lost the timbre I knew it could have at that moment. "Please stop baby. I'm so close please."</p> <p>The tip of the toy had started to push itself into a certain area of my pussy while my hand continued to work the dildo in and out of my pussy. I was starting to come when I felt the tip go around and slip between my lips. I looked down to see the toy as I worked it into my pussy. The little ridges of bumps and bumps of the toy were causing a slight but perceptible shiver of my body. All the time the toy's movements pushed my body into the dildo, forcing my hips forward even more.</p> <p>The toy that I was working into me began to hum softly as my hips started undulating. The toy would go a bit deeper inside of me with each thrust. Each thrust was like pushing back just a bit. My hips were doing things in counterpoint with the toy that I didn't know were possible. Then the toy stopped. I looked down to see the dildo all the way inside of me.</p> <p>"Baby please can't you stop." I pulled my hand away from my sex and turned it around on the desk. The dildo slowly began to move back and forth on its own.</p> <p>"Don't tell me what to do you dumb slut."</p> <p>"I don't do tricks you bastard." I tried to move the dildo back to it's normal pace. It didn't stop moving. Once the toy had stopped thrusting I looked up at it. "God....please let me have it....."</p> <p>"OK." I turned my hips from side to side. "Hmmm...damn, this is fun."</p> <p>I leaned my head back and closed my eyes. The toy had slipped all the way out. The dildo was now standing up off of its own accord. It had started to spin and my body was writhing around it at an incredible pace. I had taken the toy out of me and was now looking at it. I couldn't believe how it had slid so easily inside of it's own design. The little ridges and bumps of the dildo were now moving around me like little vibrators. The thing was just a little bigger than my average penis, and it was still very hard.</p> <p>I slowly reached up and began pinching each nipple. "Please.....I can't......noooo...." I whimpered.</p> <p>The toy had paused a minute ago now. This time it started to slide out again. "Please." My voice caught in my throat. I pushed away from the desk and began to undo the buttons and blouse of my suit jacket. It fell open and I could feel my warm bare breasts pressed against the cool desk. It went down to my ankles. I lifted them straight up into the air and began to run my hands up my legs.</p> <p>My skirt fell to the ground and I turned to face the desk. It was a skirt with a snap closure at each side. I picked it up and pulled it across my hips and tossed it off to the side. I then brought both hands around to the front of my body. The skirt was long and flowed loosely along the front. "You are really going to get a birthday massage."</p> <p>I tossed the skirt across the desk and stood up from it. My hands began to run all over my body. My hands went up my stomach and over my breasts. I felt the little bumps that were starting to form at my sides and down my sides when I reached around and began to stroke them. It had been so long since any man had touched me like this. It felt so good. I lowered my hands down my body.</p> <p>"Are you ready?" The dildo had stopped moving and I didn't try to bring it back to it's own motion.</p> <p>"Oh no, do you like this?"</p> <p>I had turned around the desk and was now on it's back. I had a straight back arching as if I was being pulled down. The desk was cold, but it was starting to feel good in my hands. I had my eyes closed and I could feel hands on my ass cheeks and pussy. "It has to be your husband who gave it to me today. I can't let you forget it."</p> <p>I looked over my shoulder at the guy from the gym. "He gave it to me today." The guy was working on his muscles. The man had a huge grin on his face.</p> <p>"Oh yes he didn't give me the massage that you did. I was so nervous before coming down." I watched as he turned his head and smiled at me. "You really have it on good." The man had taken his hands off his stomach.
