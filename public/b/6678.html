She tried to relax until he slipped the head inside her and then tried to push herself down onto him. At first she tried to force his cock all the way inside her body, but it took a while until after some effort, she managed to get herself completely down on it. His hands were on his shoulders, his hands were now on her ass, lifting her off the sand. He held his position and slowly let her sit back again. The whole process again had taken less than 10 seconds, but she was completely in his control when her entire body started to respond once more, to twitch and to jump from excitement even though the orgasm had been intense.</p> <p>When she had recovered from the orgasm, she had just sat there, and she could feel every inch of him inside her. It was all she could do to keep from moaning as he lifted her so that she was sitting on him, her ass against the shore of the cove, his hands supporting her weight.</p> <p>"Oh, Mike, that was great."</p> <p>"I think you just earned your reward," he said, smiling at her, his eyes twinkling as he felt her body start to tremble again.</p> <p>"Oh, Mike, that was wonderful," she whispered.</p> <p>"It was a reward, wasn't it?"</p> <p>She nodded as she leaned forward, and she could feel his hands tighten all over her. She started slowly, and it felt like a dream, like if he squeezed her breasts and pinched her nipples, if he touched her clit, if he put an index finger inside her, if he finger fucked her mouth or her pussy. When he put his fingers inside her, she came, even harder; she felt as if her body was trying to control her brain and her mind.</p> <p>When she had been able to take her own first orgasm, she stood up and quickly stood up onto the small ledge she'd laid out, feeling as if she was actually being carried over another planet. She tried to pull herself up to sit completely onto his cock, but he held her there and she was powerless, just sitting there on the shore, in his arms, just completely on fire again. She felt herself start to sweat again as her breasts moved up and down with her heartbeat. When she had recovered enough, she was only able to move a bit more, with the last of her body.</p> <p>Then she could feel her hands go to her crotch again.</p> <p>"What is wrong with me?" she called out in a pout.</p> <p>"You aren't even ready to use a condom, little sister."</p> <p>"But the condom," she begged, "I'm on the pill."</p> <p>"That's okay, dear," he said, "I'll take care of you. Now just lie there and let me do all the work, okay?"</p> <p>He began to work his hands all over her body again, touching everywhere. Her own breasts were squashed against his chest and her clit was rubbing against him, still a part of her mind that was not her body was trying to control her body. The way he was holding her, his whole body, his hands, his whole being pressed against her again and again, made her feel like she could be a part of every movement from him. The way his mouth was moving in little circles around her nipple when she arched her back.</p> <p>He moved one hand to her clit, caressing it with his finger. Then he ran his hand up her thigh.</p> <p>"There," he said, "all covered."</p> <p>He moved his hand around to her belly, under her breasts and up, then came to rest on her mouth again. When she didn't turn away, he let his fingers rest on her lips.</p> <p>"Good girl, just hold still," he said, and she felt her mouth open slightly. "Open as wide as you can." Her body was in the same position as once, but suddenly, her mouth had gone wider as his middle finger entered her.</p> <p>It hurt, because her muscles were in a vice, trying to hold his finger inside herself, but once her hips began to move and push herself against his hand, she relaxed.</p> <p>"Just relax," he said, and he began to move his finger slightly inside her, in and out. She thought she heard a groan, something like, "Oh God, Mike, that's good," but it was completely her imagination. Her lips stretched out and her mouth closed around his finger in a sucking "mmm," pattern. Then she could feel her hips moving, trying to keep him inside her as she was pushed backward, into his finger.</p> <p>She was afraid it wasn't going to work, but, when she opened her mouth, it opened backâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
