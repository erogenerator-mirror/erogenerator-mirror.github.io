I asked, confused.</p> <p>"Not quite." She stated, still looking away from me but with a smile. "Last night was kind of awkward."</p> <p>"That should be." She seemed to relax a little.</p> <p>"I just don't like that you are so obviously turned on." I said as firmly. "And besides, I've been horny when we're together." She laughed nervously, obviously thinking about what I was likely to do later tonight.</p> <p>"You don't have to be embarrassed if you want to stay mad at me." She seemed like she was a little defensive, as if I had told her to fuck off.</p> <p>"Well if you do, I think I owe you a little something." She leaned closer to me and kissed me lightly on the lips. "It's only fair that you get to taste yourself, too!" She said, making a halfhearted attempt at sucking my lips between her thumb and forefinger. It didn't last very long.</p> <p>"You better stop before you make me." She warned, but smiled knowing as well as I did that if she kept this up I was going to make her cum. "Come on, we've got all night!" She stood up and pulled me up. "Make sure the sheets are clean." She smiled as she walked to the bathroom where she cleaned up. I left, thinking that I owed her a kiss.</p> <p>I woke up the next day feeling very horny and couldn't wait for the weekend to come. It also took way too much willpower to bring my laptop so my thoughts of tonight weren't that obvious to me but it wasn't all that bad. It didn't take long to get in the shower and put on the porn video (with hot little brunette, obviously). I came out to the living room wearing a new pair of boxers and t-shirt and a pair of basketball shorts. I'm pretty sure I was going to be naked by dinner time or even if I did eat.</p> <p>I made my way to the kitchen table and stopped in front of the microwave. The screen showed the video I was watching for and I felt like I was going to cum right there. The screen then showed a picture of an older woman with medium sized breasts sitting on a kitchen bench. She was looking directly at the camera and rubbing a pair of large breasts through the cups of her bra. I looked at the clock. It was 3:40! Not what I thought it could be but I tried to stay horny as this video had started! So I did. I wanted desperately to finish up the video and then bring both of us to orgasm together but I didn't dare. I finally finished the video and went back to the kitchen for breakfast and a quick bite for my cereal. It was very, very late and I went back to my own apartment (which was just a few meters from where we were sitting.) And got dressed, then sat on a futon at night, thinking of what might happen later.</p> <p>That Saturday was just coming to an end for me. Our date night seemed to finally come. The thought of this evening finally approaching made me crazy. However, it seemed to be going my way. I was excited, aroused and really excited about the night.</p> <p>It was around 10:00 when I made my way over to Anna's house. I was wearing a blue low cut tank top with a white button down shirt and black slacks and my eyes were glued to her. I knocked once, to say it was a good time to stop. Anna, as always seemed a little apprehensive and even a little bit concerned, but then smiled and smiled and knocked on my house once again.</p> <p>She opened the front door and greeted me. "Hi, Steve." She held out her hand and we shook. I was already feeling horny but I held back more than I thought I would. "Good to see you, Anna."</p> <p>"Nice to see you too, Steve. Come on in!" She led the way into her house. The first door on the right was hers. I hadn't seen it yet but I thought we were in her family room. She pulled the door open and we both froze. The room had all the normal furniture: a queen-size, matching dresser, a couple of chairs and a couple of tables and a large coffee table. "We had a great weekend!" Anna explained.</p> <p>"Yeah, I did, I really did." I told her.</p> <p>"Thanks, sweetie! I really enjoyed the company, and the whole time!" She hugged me. We held each other close and for a bit we just stood there. I felt her breasts pressed against my chest. For a little minute we just stepped around and I just held her. We talked a little about the movie and the time that we had beenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
