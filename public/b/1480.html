I don't want to be your slut. You can have me if you want."</p> <p>He leaned back on the couch, and looked at her. He smiled a bit, but something was different now. This was a person, not a force force. He knew himself better. "You want to be fucked?" he said. "You want me." He wasn't just an image in her mind, "I could just do that."</p> <p>"I don't want that," she said.</p> <p>"Why? Have you thought about it? Do you want to feel me inside of you?" he said. She had been pretty worked up about him ever since her parents had taken him to a party, and hadn't had to see what that thing inside her mother's clothes did to him. "If you want that, I can just do."</p> <p>She didn't want this. She wanted him.</p> <p>And she didn't know how to make it happen. She wanted nothing more at that moment than for him to take her, use her, and leave. But that's what she was here for. Just to get fucked.</p> <p>He moved over her and pressed himself between her legs, her legs automatically parting to accommodate him. She took him in and put her hands on his shoulders, and looked up at him. He leaned back and just looked at her. This had already been the most intense, and she'd been aching for this, but she found herself in a new place. This was her time for just being with him, with wanting to know he was inside of her. It was his time for just having this to do with her.</p> <p>She looked him in the eye. And said, "Take me."</p> <p>He nodded and pulled his boxers off. He grabbed her, and pulled her down to him, wrapping his arms around her as much and as passionately as he could. His mouth found her neck as she wrapped her legs around him, drawing him into her. His own hips thrust up into her, his hardness pressing against her.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want this?" he said, as he put his mouth on her lips.</p> <p>She opened her mouth in response, his tongue thrusting back in, as though he had entered her mouth. He thrust his hips up and pulled back again. "More," she said. He smiled a little. "That's my good girl," he said as he bent and took her nipples between his teeth, and twisted them. He was already hard as hard could be, even though he was completely inside her. He felt like he needed to take some time before he finally came over to fuck her, since she felt so good after so many minutes.</p> <p>His hips thrust upwards, and he felt something inside her. Something that drove him wild, and pushed him closer to an orgasm. His eyes locked onto hers. She was ready. She felt him pull back, and then lunge forward impaling her as his tongue touched hers. She tasted herself on his tongue, her body being pushed out by their thrusts. "I'm coming," she heard herself say.</p> <p>She felt him thrust into her as far as possible, and he took his mouth off of her to speak. "I'm coming," he said, "here I come." He thrust into her violently, her legs and arms holding him down, as the first of his orgasm washed over him.</p> <p>He continued thrusting, as the third of its waves subsided, and then they slowed. She still had both her arms around him as he slowly withdrew. She held her arms around his waist, as she felt a small amount of moisture on her legs. He lifted himself slightly up off of her. Her legs were open, her arms. He had lifted one foot so it was against his hip, and then took his hand and placed it on her leg and rubbed in small circles. There was no way he could actually take both the leg and her ankle into his hands. She had her legs tied to his hips completely, almost as though trying to move her legs to keep him away from her.</p> <p>He moved into her, and again he took her hands and placed them on the armrest of the couch.</p> <p>"Now I'm going to fuck you," he said as he moved his hips back and forth, as if he was fucking her brains out.</p> <p>"Fuck me..." she said, in response. She knew that's what she wanted now. "My cunt."</p> <p>"Yeah," he said, and then paused. He saw a glimmer come in her eyes, a look that said he was on her way, whether thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
