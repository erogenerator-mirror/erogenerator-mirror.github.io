"Excuse me," he said.</p> <p>"No, I must not." There was an air of finality, of sadness - like he was giving it up, and letting go of her.</p> <p>"No. That's not true. I just want to see you," he said, but I didn't want to see him, "It's not right and it won't be right," he said.</p> <p>"But, I want to see you," she said, trying to convince herself.</p> <p>"No, that's not true. That can't be true." There was a hint of a smile.</p> <p>The man was standing there with his hand out, but his eyes were closed. He kept his eyes closed, but I wasn't able to see, but it looked like he had a hand around one of his legs, a finger inside his pants.</p> <p>"Please, can I go get dressed?" she begged. There was a slight quaver to her voice, and, like before, her tone went as if she was upset, and this time it was as if she was trying to keep it, try and fight it. There was a hint of anger and disgust in her voice. I guess I could have played the part of the sympathetic, sympathetic.</p> <p>The man seemed to be having the time of his life, and he probably did, too, although my guess was, based on the expression on his face, he was doing him a big disservice, although he surely knew he had to be in his mid-40's for this. He had no idea that a man half his age was a woman his age, but what I would have bet my life that it must be illegal, that he might be, had I had never met Miss.</p> <p>"Of course, you can. It makes no difference. We can stay."</p> <p>"What about our husbands? What about our children?"</p> <p>"If you're not ready," he said, "they can stay with you. If you're ready, they can play with you."</p> <p>"Well, at least if I'm ready, they won't have to stay." She looked down at herself. "What the hell? What kind of men are they? You would be right, they won't have to stay with me. At least, I wouldn't have to."</p> <p>At first he was smiling at her, but then, he leaned over and reached around her neck, pulling her to him as he reached between her tits. His hand was right below her chin. "That's it," he said to her.</p> <p>She didn't resist, so I suppose by now, he knew it was up to her, he just couldn't. She didn't have her bra on, and the blouse was not unbuttoned, either. In fact, my view must have been down her blouse, because suddenly I was staring at her naked breasts. They were small, but just the tiniest, and were soft and pink. The nipple, if anything, was larger than the one she had left behind.</p> <p>She didn't resist. As I watched, she took his hand, and placed his fingers inside her bra. For some reason I knew that this was a trick, that one of the bra's were going to be open, and I wasn't going to be able to resist. My face flushed red even as I imagined them pushing themselves together, rubbing at her clit, her ass, her pussy, her ass crack. And at this very moment there is something I wanted.</p> <p>I wanted to see her nipple pushed between his fingers, and I wanted to touch it. I wanted to taste her. I wanted to suck it, to lick it. If she was like the boys, she wasn't going to have to wear a bra. She would just have to let him feel her boobs like he had to. What is wrong with me?</p> <p>Suddenly, his fingers were inside her bra. She didn't try to stop them, she didn't try to stop him. I was mesmerized, stunned and mesmerized, at the same time.</p> <p>"Are you all right?" he asked.</p> <p>"I don't think so." At this point I had already figured out that, despite what others might think, she wasn't going to object to him touching her tits like that. I knew. I had already figured out what a breast felt like.</p> <p>"What about you - what do you think that makes you want me?"</p> <p>In response she didn't say anything. Instead, she just let him feel her. She didn't feel, she didn't see anything she knew. I imagined my legs being spread, her pussy beingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
