We walked to the front door and as we did we kissed as we entered the garage. "Let's go upstairs, shall we?" I whispered.</p> <p>"Yes, I'll fix my hair," she smiled. "But no peeking." With that she turned and left.</p> <p>"What a sweetheart," I mused to myself. I didn't think I'd ever have to see her again, but it had been so long since we last saw each other. After we kissed and the lights came back on, we went up to our room, undressed and fell onto the bed. I don't know what brought that up; maybe she got scared that we were going to do something that hurt our relationship, or maybe she wanted to be alone with me and needed the space, which I hoped to give her.</p> <p>She wasn't too tired after all. She came into our bed a minute later, lay down with us and we shared a wonderful, passionate embrace. "That was very sweet, Nick," she said.</p> <p>"It's probably the most beautiful thing I've ever felt."</p> <p>"Thank you, you're the best. Did you sleep well?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes," I smiled.</p> <p>"Good," she smiled. "I need a shower," she laughed.</p> <p>"It's a great idea," I grinned as I got out of bed to go get it myself.</p> <p>"Mmm, yes. I'll shower in the master bedroom. Want me to join you?" she asked after a moment.</p> <p>"You were right. You'll have to put on something special for when you're ready to do that."</p> <p>"I'll be ready. Come on, I'm going to be down in a little while. Take off your clothes and grab a shower. I'll join you after I shower."</p> <p>"Sounds great," I smiled before I went out the door. By the time the water ran cold, I was hard and ready to go. It had been awhile since I'd been with a woman like this and even longer since I'd been naked as I had to get to work.</p> <p>She was a long time coming when I finally emerged from our shower. I was just in my towel when she came out of her room. "Wow, you're gorgeous when you're wet," I grinned.</p> <p>"Thanks, Nick, You're the best," she smiled.</p> <p>"Let's hurry and see just how much I'm really good at taking showers," I answered.</p> <p>I don't know why it had to end; we had just broken up. I think it's because I had some wild sex with her, and I couldn't stop thinking about it when I felt so sad. That feeling was multiplied fivefold when that crazy idea of her coming to see me naked, or even seeing me naked came into a whole new place. I think I kind of lost my cool at that moment, because I wasn't sure what to say to her, so I just looked at her as she was stepping into the shower.</p> <p>I could see her eyes move down to my body, and that look said everything to me. Her eyes moved over my entire body, as if they were looking for all the world like a magnet. They lingered on my cock, which was already semi-hard, which made me want to be able to grab it and stroke it. She looked into my eyes, then gave me a quick peck on the cheek. I moved her shower curtain back, stepped out, and grabbed the luffa soap and got out of the shower.</p> <p>"You can wash all of me with that soap," I grinned.</p> <p>"Are you crazy, Nick?"</p> <p>"I couldn't get over what you gave me."</p> <p>"I don't know what you give me, but no shower like that," she laughed. "I think it's time we go back to bed to finish what we started."</p> <p>"I can't wait," I smiled.</p> <p>"I want you to so bad, but don't we have a deal for now?" she asked as she reached for the shampoo. I moved under the shower to wash away the soap. "We can fix that right here in the bedroom."</p> <p>We got under the stream of water and our bodies were pressed against each other as our heads moved so our lips were almost touching. It was slow, languid and wet. It didn't last long, however. She grabbed the sides of the shower and held me while she lifted herself so that my arms were wrapped around her. She kissed me softly as we stood under the water, then we slowly undressed each other. First of all I kissed her deeply while I used the soap to scrub her breasts and body, then I knelt on the floor so I could get to her. She didn't resist when Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
