They are more important anyway. It's just the thought of making money like we use those dollars."</p> <p>"So I could pay them?"</p> <p>I thought about that for a moment. "I don't know. It's just that..."</p> <p>"Just what?"</p> <p>I looked at her, and she smiled as if to say, "You don't understand."</p> <p>"I understand," I said. "All you have to do is look at the money and it'll be ours. You have to do it. It's a beautiful thought, isn't it?"</p> <p>She nodded her head in acceptance as she looked off.</p> <p>"There's no better way to start a business."</p> <p>She leaned over and kissed me before looking back up at me. There was a small twinkle in her eye, and I leaned over and gave her a peck on the lips.</p> <p>"What?" she asked.</p> <p>"Just try it," I told her with a grin. "I'm sure I can figure out the best thing you could think of."</p> <p>"I can do that. Okay?"</p> <p>"Yes. I'm sure you'll find it interesting."</p> <p>"Okay, I'll try. Bye."</p> <p>"Bye." Then she smiled and I heard her head pop off the bed, and I stood up and followed her down the hallway until we got to the first door - the bedroom. She knocked on the door once, and almost immediately someone opened the door, giving me a wave and peck on the cheek.</p> <p>"Come in," I said, "and you," I said, and we both got naked in front of the couch, then turned around.</p> <p>"Honey, I was wondering if you were going to do it with him?" she asked.</p> <p>"Honey, I'm not sure I'm going to do it with Mike."</p> <p>So it was done, but not just yet.</p> <p>"Okay...I'm going to watch the video."</p> <p>I pulled my hard cock out of my boxers, and she opened her mouth and I got my camera out and began taking pictures. She had a small cock, about eight inches, not too thick, and it was rock hard. The tip of her tongue was licking the underside of my balls. I reached out and spread her legs. I got on camera, and she turned around and positioned herself.</p> <p>"Do you want me to suck it, or do you want to use..."</p> <p>I just stood there, holding up the camera, while she took out a condom and began to slowly slide it into her own pussy. It was tight, but she soon adjusted, and finally she was taking me in with no pain. She had a great pussy. She closed her eyes and threw her head back. It felt so good to be inside of her like this. I was so fucking hard. I grabbed some lube from my bedside table and put some on my cock. It felt so fucking good as I slid into her. It was as she had remembered that when she was getting fucked. This was no time to be thinking about when she had a new husband and a new baby. What she wanted was a man, a man who could make her cum. And it felt so fucking good as I worked into her. And she was loving it, too.</p> <p>I came in her, shooting my cum up into her, and she kept it all in the condom, taking it all out and putting in on the camera. Then she was ready to ride with me again. I was ready for her, but she didn't have any more.</p> <p>"No, we don't have time for this."</p> <p>"Oh yeah? Well then, I guess I better go find Mike. That'll make him come in my mouth."</p> <p>"No, never mind about that, okay?"</p> <p>"But no fucking, I'll just..."</p> <p>"I don't care. It was hot."</p> <p>"Then go find him."</p> <p>I went over to my bed, and she was lying on her back, watching me.</p> <p>"Get under that and do it," she said. I moved up and got underneath her on her stomach, and knelt there. I could see her legs spread as I got between them. I had to lean over a little so I got the head of my cock in front of her pussy, and slowly rubbed it up, feeling it's length.
