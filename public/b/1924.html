The card continued its trip down as I slid it off her soft pink shoulder and then gently touched the hard bone under her arm.</p> <p>“You are a good girl…” I whispered lightly in her ear.</p> <p>I watched as I turned her and pulled her back in the reclining position and moved myself up her body, positioning I straddled her body taking a deep deep breath letting my hand go to her stomach.</p> <p>“Does he take video”? I asked quietly watching her as she watched my hand begin to caress the hard bone under her arm.</p> <p>“He does…but no he does” she whispered watching as I began to slowly stroke the hair on her chest.</p> <p>When I reached the skin under my hand I felt for the hard bone under my palm, feeling the small pad there I knew he wasn’t hard at all “I know he is… I love watching you” I said quietly to her as my finger ran lightly along the hair. My breath quickened in my chest as my hand began to explore her. She lifted her knees to the mattress and brought them up to me lifting them up allowing her legs to swing back and forth.</p> <p>“Marry him…” she finally whispered moving her head to look me in the eyes.</p> <p>I shook my head no, no way then moved a finger over the hair I could smell her essence on my finger. My cock responded, pressing out against my sweat pants, it felt bigger then it should feel. She took a step back and looked up at me.</p> <p>“Do you think…” she said running her eyes over my body. “Maybe you should let me know…” I whispered touching her cheek.</p> <p>"Or you can come to my room…” I nodded, her eyes moved from my body to look at me, “Or you can come tomorrow…” my hand moved over her body running through her hair lightly touching her face.</p> <p>“Or maybe I should call your father and let you know how he feels after that day.” I told her.</p> <p>The doorbell rang ringing as she walked to the door, her long legs crossed, her small butt swaying slightly as she moved to answer the door. As her hand reached for the bell, I watched her eyes move to it I could see the lust in her face.</p> <p>“I think I better leave you alone,” I whispered moving to the door, opening with her hand shaking slightly. Just as I stepped through the door she walked towards me dropping her head to kiss me as I reached out, her hand wrapping in mine and pulling my face back, her mouth moved quickly over mine tasting her own essence in my mouth.</p> <p>My hands holding her body, pulling back as my fingers touched her hair, I could feel her body tremble slightly on my hand. Our tongues dancing as I whispered soft things in her ear. “Are you sure you like to come here,” I whispered, my other hand moving over her body and squeezing her cheek.</p> <p>I could see the desire in her eyes.</p> <p>We walked towards the bedroom, her body swaying as our bodies moved together as we closed the door behind us, I could feel the passion in her heart again as she took my hand and led my hand up her thigh. As I pressed up her thigh my other arm pushed up her stomach moving with the curve of her body as I slowly dragged my fingers down over her body to her belly. I could feel her shaking as I brought my hand back up her body to touch her lightly between her legs again. “Are you ready to feel my cock inside you” I whispered touching the small mound just above her womanhood with my finger, as her body held still my finger made contact with the moist mound.</p> <p>“I can’t,” she whispered lifting her ass to bring herself closer to my finger, “if you’ll just sit where you are” as her body sat on my finger. I could feel it on my finger sliding over her swollen—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
