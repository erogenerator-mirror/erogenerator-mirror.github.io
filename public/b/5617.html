How come?"</p> <p>"I'll ask. I'm just curious."</p> <p>"Have you..." Sarah blushed</p> <p>"No, not at all."</p> <p>"Really? That's strange."</p> <p>"Well, when we were younger, we would sit next to each other on the swings and talk. Do you know a couple of them that don't have swings?"</p> <p>"I've heard that."</p> <p>"Okay. We sometimes watch the other's walk by."</p> <p>"I have. It helps me with the school. There are swingers and swingers walk in the old wood store, but it's very discreet."</p> <p>"Have you seen the people on the swings before?"</p> <p>"No. They come a lot but it isn't that big."</p> <p>"Yes, the school has a couple of them. We've even seen them on the porch, or go down the street after school."</p> <p>"Maybe," Sarah said. "Can you tell me about them? How did they get in?"</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>Sarah went to the bookcase and found a couple of books and a brief story and a sketch pad and started working. It was about a woman standing on the path, watching her neighbor walk by. It was a rather tame story and she felt a bit uncomfortable going further. But she couldn't help herself from going and getting a better look at her neighbor on the swing.</p> <p>Sarah went back to the bookcase in less than half an hour. She had a lot of work to do, but she kept going and she even finished the story before she could. Sarah was really enjoying herself and felt good. She stopped at the last one that she thought she would not finish. It was a little long, about the second part of a scene. She felt that she had to complete it, even if the story got too rushed. But Sarah kept doing it anyway. As she worked, Sarah looked at some of the people on the swings and she found out that she had a couple of girls. One had her arm around her friend as the rest of the group was walking by. Sarah thought that she should tell them to go away, but she decided to wait. She wanted them to be happy. And she liked being the center of attention. There were a couple of women in the swing, two others on the other one, but Sarah had seen them before and they were the ones that caught Sarah's eye. And so to keep them interested enough, Sarah took a piece of wood into town in to have lunch. She found a quiet table in the next room, got a glass of water and got herself a cup of tea for the walk back to the house. As she sat there, she thought about the girl in the swing across the way, and her friend. She also wondered if she could get some help from them, and just if they would go for it. She would be surprised if she couldn't help herself. Sarah finished her tea and went into the bookcase. She didn't bother changing at the bottom of the rack, but pulled out her notebook and a pen. She took some notes on how to write a couple of lines she read, picked up a pen, and then started writing. A few minutes passed, with her thoughts going back to the swing. Then she heard someone coming in the door of which she had just been standing. It was the first girl she had ever come to know well. It was the one in the swing. She had been going to come over to her neighbor for the last couple of days. That one had been there about twelve hours before and had not seen her. Sarah had told him that she was there just to see him, and had not come because she did not want to interrupt his work.</p> <p>"Sarah! There you are."</p> <p>"Uh, hi. Do you have someone to talk to?"</p> <p>"Nope. I'm here visiting my wife here. Would you like to come in? I'm really sorry about stopping by for a drink."</p> <p>"Sure. I would love to, but we just met. You could come in."</p> <p>"Okay. Is there somewhere we can talk, Sarah?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes. I don't mind if you can have a drink. I don't think it would hurt to have a drink. I just don't drink very often."</p> <p>"Nonsense, you drink just fine." Sarah reached down and brushed a stray hair from Sarah's face to look at the woman on the swing. "Would you mind if I join you?"</p> <p>Sarah took her glass of wine from the table, turned itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
