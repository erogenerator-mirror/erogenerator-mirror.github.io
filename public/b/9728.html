She couldn't see him, just listen to the music. She couldn't hear anything from him but his voice just moments before. Was this what he wanted? Did he know this was what he wanted? He had the nerve to tell her that he couldn't go with her to see Dr. Morgan. That would be a lie, and it'd break her heart, and make her heart sing. She felt so awful. How could he do that to her? And then to her? How could he expect her to listen to him?</p> <p>"Why would you even want to see me?" she whispered, looking down, not at him anymore.</p> <p>"I just want you to listen, and do what you always do," he said evenly, looking at her. He could tell the tone was changing, and he liked it. Why should she do that to him?</p> <p>"Just say so," he said softly. "I won't say anything."</p> <p>"Fine. But, I want you to listen, and do it with the love you always do."</p> <p>"I don't... I won't," he said again, looking back at her.</p> <p>"That was the promise you made, wasn't it?"</p> <p>He shrugged and looked up. She knew he couldn't see her, he just knew whatever she said to him it was true.</p> <p>"I would listen to whatever doctor in the world tells me to listen," she said in a small way. "And, I know this is all part of your plan of getting me to give in and let you use me. And, if it happens again, then I think I'll just wait and see what happens."</p> <p>He shrugged once more and looked back at her. He felt his face become hot, and a strange feeling in his stomach. He hated his stomach, and he hated how he felt in this moment. He hated the idea of not going through with this. That maybe he could make sure he did not do the things that he just had and get to watch someone else do them.</p> <p>"Alright, fine. Just go." She stepped to him, putting her hand out to stop him.</p> <p>"But I don't want to." That seemed to ease the feeling of guilt, and he was relieved just to have at least tried.</p> <p>"You're right," she sighed. "It isn't this way."</p> <p>He reached his hands out to her, feeling her arms.</p> <p>"I'm willing to go along with this because." He took her hand and felt the curve of her biceps. He liked how it felt, and how it looked. He didn't like it that she was going to be this cold and he felt bad for her. "And this," he said, and saw her shiver. "It's not just you."</p> <p>She smiled sweetly.</p> <p>"Just go." She turned away from him, walking to the door.</p> <p>"Wait," he murmured. "Okay, I'll talk to you later, okay?"</p> <p>"Of course," she said, smiling.</p> <p>She shut the door and walked back to him, wrapping him in her arms. He could feel the warmth of her body, feel her heart beating against his. She felt so good. He didn't know when the moment was over, but he knew at that moment it was. They didn't even know each other until, and that's why they were in his car on the way to the doctor's. They were on the way there together.</p> <p>"I'm so sorry," he murmured against her hair.</p> <p>"It's ok, sweetie."</p> <p>She rubbed his back as they walked back to the car. She wondered if he was getting the feeling that she would be doing just that. She wondered if she could possibly get to like the way he smelled. She wondered to herself if she could, how she could possibly like to feel it.</p> <p>He turned towards her as he said, "We didn't agree on those rules, but you did say you wanted to see me again," he smiled. "It's okay for you to take the lead, but not too much of a lead when you want to push yourself, and go out for long walks with a stranger if you think you're not ready to do that. And if you want to give yourself a chance, and make this a good relationship, I want to ask you to go on a date with me."</p> <p>She stopped walking and looked at him with a question in her eyes.</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Really." He smiled, and pulled her into his lap, her hips rubbing against him.
