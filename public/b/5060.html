I felt a hand in the pocket of my jeans, pulling my shirt out of my jeans. I turned, and saw a gorgeous face. It was her.</p> <p>"I think we should go inside, before you turn into a hussy."</p> <p>"A hussy?!? Why the hell are you calling me??"</p> <p>I had no comeback. My arms were still around her. She was now reaching up to my face and gently stroking it with her hands.</p> <p>"I just want to talk to you, honey," I managed, "We will have a few more beers."</p> <p>"We?" she asked in her sexy voice.</p> <p>"Yeah," I responded.</p> <p>"How about the bathroom?" I added.</p> <p>"I just thought you might want to go ahead."</p> <p>"Nope, I want it back in there," I told her.</p> <p>"So, tell me about it. How's the water coming? We've been here a day too long."</p> <p>"I'm not quite sure yet," I lied.</p> <p>"Maybe we better go. I have to run in a few more minutes."</p> <p>I got a beer from the cooler. As I walked past her, I bent to give her a kiss. Her lips and tongue greeted me. I stepped back but she was walking away from me.</p> <p>"Is that a guy's cock in your mouth?" she asked.</p> <p>Well, at least the guy had some. It was at least seven inches and thick.</p> <p>"Yes, it's a guy's cock," I told her.</p> <p>"Well, maybe we'll see you again, tomorrow."</p> <p>"I want to stay here in here forever."</p> <p>"I do too. I want more beer with this."</p> <p>After a couple more beers we walked back into the bar. We continued to converse with each other for the past two hours, with her flirting a lot with me, and my cock always straining against my jeans and shorts. Eventually, we were able to get her to open the restaurant door and step out. As she walked past me, I handed her her towel, "Just in," she smiled, and walked away down the hallway. Within minutes one of the staff was sitting down at the bar. I couldn't help but stare at her shapely naked ass as she walked by. I looked at her tits as she walked past me, then turned and smiled at her. She was smiling too, I couldn't help but feel my cock start to pulse.</p> <p>As we neared the counter, she called me, "I need another beer."</p> <p>I sat down and waited for it. While she was sitting down, she took a small glass and a small amount of the wine. She handed one to me and raised her glass for one final toast to me.</p> <p>"To being with you," she said.</p> <p>This time she was speaking in the sweetest way, I had to smile to hear her say it.</p> <p>As I started to drink, I heard sounds of her coming. I looked at her as she sat there. She was looking at me, her big blues eyes staring into mine. The wine was doing wonders for my nerves.</p> <p>As she started talking again, I had to admit she was a really sexy woman. She was also so beautiful. She was wearing a pair of loose fitting jeans but I could see her panties through them. She was standing near me, leaning against the counter a few feet away, the bottle in her hand. This was perfect. The two of us, sitting on one of the tables, I was watching her talk, I was watching her sexy body and her talking.</p> <p>I have to say that my cock had started to grow a little as I watched her talking. I had my hands behind me, playing with myself as we talked and I could hear the sounds of her talking.</p> <p>As she said all this, she leaned forward with her hands on the counter, her tits pressed against the wooden surface. Her body was almost completely exposed, although I could make out a bit of a bulge between her legs. I could tell that she was feeling really horny as well.</p> <p>The bottle was running a little to slow. As she finished talking, I started to rub my cock with one hand.</p> <p>"So, what do you want to see?" she asked as she leaned in to kiss me.</p> <p>"I'll have to ask you about that," I responded.</p> <p>"No, we are going to see about that. And we will have another beer," she said and walked away to a shelf in the bar. As she walked away, I could feel my prick slowly growing harder.</p> <p>I looked back. She was on her knees at the edge of the bar, and had one of her hands on the counter. I started to lick her tits and put my lips on her nipples as I continued to suck.</p> <p>"Godâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
