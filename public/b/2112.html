"Take me home. I can't do that anymore."</p> <p>"Are you begging? Or pleading?"</p> <p>"Please! You raped me!" she cried. "I'm not going to be free. I'm not going to be able to control myself!"</p> <p>She was being tortured by the tears running down her cheeks. The only thing that could escape her was his fingers sliding into the wet hair of her pussy. Her thighs spread easily as his fingers moved closer to her center. She closed her eyes and let herself go. Her hips tried to open but his hands held her still when she became desperate. She felt his fingers slide inside of her, moving slowly in and out.</p> <p>"Please . . . oh yes!" she cried. "Oh god, yes!"</p> <p>She felt so wet and open inside. He knew that he could easily get her off like this if he was good—and even more than he was now. He moved and his fingers pushed slowly deeper into her depths. He was going to make her come when he touched her G-spot.</p> <p>"Yes, I've been waiting too long for this, sweetie," his lips were on her earlobe and he nuzzled close to her ear again. "You're so beautiful," he said. "I love every part of your body on end."</p> <p>She could only moan his name and let her head loll back as the first of her climaxes approached.</p> <p>"Do you want to come, sweetie? Does your Master love you?" he whispered.</p> <p>"Oh god yes!" she sighed, her hips pumping into his hand, her body quaking and shaking, her hands clawing at the carpet as the waves crashed to its surface.</p> <p>"Look at your Master. Watch, little one," he murmured. "Watch as he takes you to his delight."</p> <p>She shook and writhed as his long fingers began to stroke the tender spot that always made her orgasm such a powerful one. She tried to hold back as the orgasm began to build in her body. As it did his voice was as if it had come from far away.</p> <p>"Your Master loves you. When we all come together, he will come over. You must be a beautiful gift to him."</p> <p>He was right. She was indeed a gift to him. The orgasm that her body had just been on had been so powerful that it had taken on a life of its own.</p> <p>He had wanted more. He needed more. And he was going to get it. It was a need that he could not deny. There was so much there that he needed to fill with himself. It would take a lot to get her to come again.</p> <p>His words and her reactions had fueled his desire and he continued to watch the trembling of her body and the flush of the crest of her body.</p> <p>He continued to watch her face as her heart quickened. She reached out and grabbed at his hand. Her body moved, lifting up and down in response to the sensations he sent into her by his fingers.</p> <p>He slid away from her body. Her hips rolled as her body was pushed to the edge of yet another climax. She pulled at him, forcing him to stop.</p> <p>"Stay. Stay," she whispered. "Make it last."</p> <p>He pulled his fingers out of her slick channel and she felt empty, completely at his mercy.</p> <p>In his hand he held a tube of lube. It made a nice, clear lube on the end of his fingers. When she heard the sound of his fingers beginning to move again and the sound of his voice and her own body, she relaxed again.</p> <p>He used the tip of his finger to press the slick substance against her entrance. Then he slowly pressed it in, inch by inch. When the tip finally touched the very core of her being, she gave another cry of bliss and pushed up hard towards him.</p> <p>He felt the tension in her arms. When her hips lifted again, he felt the tremble that rose up and down her body. There was a moment of hesitation before she pushed her hips backward. When she began the movements she used his finger to pull herself down until the tip found the opening of her cunt. She pulled down hard on him and almost immediately felt the sensation of his cockhead pushing past the outer ring of her pussy lips.</p> <p>"Oh yes," her voice was breathy. "Oh, you're so deep."</p> <p>"Your Master loves me," he whispered. "And he knows you're wet."</p> <p>"You can do anything you want to me," she moaned. "Anything at all."</p> <p>"Anything?"</p> <p>She thought she heard a smile. "Anything. I'll do anything. Anything."</p> <p>"Anything?" she whispered.
