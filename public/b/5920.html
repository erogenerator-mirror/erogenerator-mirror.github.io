The house filled with shadows as we entered into the hallway. His eyes were glued to me, as I came out into the hallway. He stopped walking as he stood still to give me a big smile as he came to the top of the stairs and stood behind me. He started slowly.</p> <p>"Mmmm it will be my pleasure, my beauty," he purred.</p> <p>I turned to face him. He leaned down slowly and ran his hands over my upper arms while reaching his lips to mine. I didn't mind because his touch was exquisite. I slowly returned the kiss to him. He grabbed my ass and squeezed as he continued to grind against me. He pulled me roughly against his body as his tongue thrust into my mouth. His hands wandered to my tits and squeezed them. I felt my nipples harden under his hands as he squeezed and pulled them, stretching them even more. I started arching my back to meet his fingers and was rewarded by one of his large hands lifting me up, to wrap around my waist.</p> <p>My face felt hot and flush. My breathing quickened and my body ached, as was he. He leaned further down and grabbed my ass and squeezed it as he pushed his pelvis into me. I wrapped my legs around his waist. His bulge rubbed against my clit from his jeans against my ass. He continued to kiss me, as our bodies mashed together.</p> <p>A knock at the door startled us both. My stomach started to knot. I slowly backed off, only to find my legs were still wrapped around him. He moved slowly back to the bedroom door and opened it. He looked at my face as I turned, and saw him standing before me. My mouth gaped wide.</p> <p>"You too!" He said with a smile as he walked towards me. I couldn't find words so I just leaned forward and kissed him. That kiss was incredible - if a little bit slow. He pulled my shirt away, so I wore a lacy pink bra. He was rubbing my nipples through the fabric of my shirt. He leaned down and kissed me again.</p> <p>"What a surprise!" He murmured huskily.</p> <p>He turned me and pushed me face down, so the tip of his cock was between my legs. His other hand slipped underneath me.</p> <p>"Oh - you're so horny," he murmured into my mouth. His lips were so warm and wet; I almost came while his dick touched my wetness. He let one hand roam down my back and gripped my hips. He pulled me back against him as he pushed me back against the door with both his hands. I could feel the excitement in his body and the excitement in his eyes, as I felt how much he would enjoy having me there naked. I could feel his dick twitch against my lips as he pressed his body harder against me. He began to drive his hips against me.</p> <p>"God - you're so hot," he grunted. I wrapped my legs tight around his waist as his thick cock slid into me. I moaned as he slid deep inside me. I moaned again as his hands moved from my waist and came around to my breasts, cupping them. He squeezed them lightly and began to squeeze them, at the same time thrusting in and out of me. "Oh - you are so fucking hot." He said between pants and groans.</p> <p>"Yes - yes - yes - yes - yes," I moaned back as my pussy began to swell even more around him. His grip on my breasts tightened - one hand reached into my skirt. He rubbed my panties and they were wet against my clit. "You're so wet," he said a lustful laugh. His hips pushed slowly and steadily into me.</p> <p>"Mmmm. I need you," I groaned.</p> <p>His fingers slid up my body and rubbed my clit. "You feel so fucking hot, and so fucking hot," he said. He pushed his fingers inside me and began to rub my g-spot. He pulled my skirt completely off me - no underwear - as he sat on the bed. He rolled me from my elbows to my knees, and then pulled me to his waist before sliding inside me again. I felt his weight on top of me. My legs still encircled him. His hands left my boobs again as he pushed me up. His hand came up my shirt to play with my nipple.</p> <p>"Oh! My - god - you- you fuck - you're making - me - cum!" I groaned loudly as my legs were pulled up around him as his dick slid deep inside me. It was almost as if he was inside me - deep and fast.
