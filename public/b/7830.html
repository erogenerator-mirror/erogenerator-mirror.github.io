My new friends were gone by that point and we all sat there in a kind of awkward silence. I made as little noise as I could for as long as I could and finally sat myself in the kitchen table where my husband worked. There were dishes in the center and he couldn't get to them fast enough.</p> <p>"Well...I guess you two are done," he said. "I've already cleaned up the dishes."</p> <p>"Yeah...my husband won't be home until late," I said. "Did you want to come?"</p> <p>"Maybe I would," he said. "But you're leaving soon, right?"</p> <p>"Yes!" I said and grabbed his hand.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Chapter 2</p> <p>My phone chimed while we walked to the door, the one that had been open just a couple of weeks before. I glanced at the display then, trying my best to look nonchalant and tried not to sound like a whore.</p> <p>"Hello?" he said.</p> <p>"It's me, baby," I managed to say. "How the hell did you get my number?"</p> <p>He grinned, gave me the phone and then handed it to a friend who had it waiting with a picture of me and Dave. They were obviously on their way to the airport. The friend pointed to the one from last night.</p> <p>"I could show you a little bit," he said, his voice rich and husky.</p> <p>I was just looking with my eyes when I saw something else. There was a second picture.</p> <p>"Oh, I...I didn't tell you your number...but I...I don't know...that's...I don't know. Did you think..."</p> <p>"Yeah, I knew, right? I'd have thought you..."</p> <p>I put my hand on his shoulder and stopped him. I looked over at my husband.</p> <p>"Baby...I..." I said and gave him a look.</p> <p>"You wanna tell me?" he said.</p> <p>"Oh yeah...I want to tell you."</p> <p>"OK." I sat back. I couldn't believe what I had heard.</p> <p>"Oh, you mean I'm your wife?" the friend of one of the guys asked.</p> <p>"Yeah," I said.</p> <p>"But who the hell is the other one?"</p> <p>"Oh there's your husband. We're just looking."</p> <p>The man smiled at that. "Yeah, she's the one that sent you the picture. You'll like it."</p> <p>"It's...Oh!"</p> <p>That brought a laugh.</p> <p>"They're a couple. This guy wants her to be his girlfriend, right? So this girl from the night they broke up...she told him that she felt jealous when he came over, so she's decided to give him a chance."</p> <p>I nodded and looked at the screen. Dave's face was clearly visible.</p> <p>"I don't know if...but I'm glad. Maybe it is time for me to get a little payback? Maybe..."</p> <p>He turned to look at me.</p> <p>"You're probably wondering about the two of them...but you know what...I don't care," he said and started to walk out.</p> <p>"What do you mean?" I asked after he had closed the door.</p> <p>"I mean all she does is give him the once-over," I said.</p> <p>"But...but she'll be leaving tomorrow."</p> <p>"But where will she go?"</p> <p>"Well, she said that she had something important to do, so we are going to pick her up and then go. You and I will be there, right?</p> <p>"Right," he said.</p> <p>"Oh, that's so nice of her to do that for me. She must have done this before. You and I have always loved her, and I wanted to give her the once-over. I just assumed she really wanted to give me this chance, but seeing the look on your face has me wondering. But we'll be there real early tomorrow, won't we?"</p> <p>With that I got up and walked towards him. I hugged him tight. "I love you!" I said and gave him a quick kiss.</p> <p>"I know," he said. "And I love you."</p> <p>"Me too," I smiled.</p> <p>We hugged. "I'm going to go to bed now, I'm tired."</p> <p>"OK."</p> <p>"No, no, I really am too. I just need to get some sleep."</p> <p>"Don't leave me the fuck alone!" Dave yelled.</p> <p>"O.K."</p> <p>It was a good thing he didn't know that, because the next morning I woke up groggy and cranky. I was sore as well and I was feeling a little frustrated about a lot of things. On top of that, I had just had a very strange dream.</p> <p>I got up early and went down to the kitchen, where everythingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
