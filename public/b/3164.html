A bit of an adventure in itself, she thought. Not in the same bed, but in the same room. He was still at that party the last year or so, talking to his friends and drinking a lot. And he'd been very happy and had a new girl friend to date.</p> <p>In her younger days, she used to be attracted to boys. Now she didn't realize how deeply she'd fallen in love with them. She always thought it was because she'd never seen anyone else really look at her, but right now she was thinking more and more like his girl friend at all times, which left the idea of him feeling more free.</p> <p>She decided that when sex with other people for the first time should be fun, but she couldn't let it stop now. She'd never even touched another man - that didn't mean that she loved him, but she knew she'd be missing that a lot.</p> <p>She'd be lying to herself, but there was another thought in her mind. She felt her pussy suddenly tingle again, or was that just her imagination? Maybe the heat from her pussy made her horny again. It certainly was in fact, and her pussy was starting to throb - it seemed to be throbbing and wanting to be touched.</p> <p>She felt her heart hammering as she thought about him touching her. She hoped she'd get to touch him again. To see what he looked like under these clothes. If he'd have a beard, she'd be ready to put it on for him.</p> <p>She'd try to see what he looked like and try not to embarrass her in front of strangers or the party full of guys. That wouldn't work.</p> <p>She'd get on her knees on the couch. She'd lick his asshole again. That always ended up in the best oral sex, her favorite kind. Maybe she'd try to do it again sometime. Maybe she'd think about all the times that she'd gotten him off and wanted to try it.</p> <p>That could wait for the night. Maybe she wouldn't.</p> <p>She lay in bed that night, fantasizing about a new boy. She felt her pussy twitch and her skin on her stomach. She wanted to touch herself again. She wanted to be able to look at him again and taste his cum.</p> <p>She wondered if he'd do it again.</p> <p>She knew he loved anal so it wouldn't be a good idea to do it with him first - but she never really thought that would be what it went for. She was afraid that he'd end up thinking of her when he was alone in his apartment.</p> <p>She hoped she'd do it again. Maybe next time.</p> <p>--</p> <p>It might be a while before he came home to her, but maybe it would still be fun. It was late in the evening. She sat up in bed, her eyes looking out at the night sky. Her dreams were filled with him - his sexy body in her bed as she slept beside him. Her heart thumped. She was getting close again. She needed to get out of here. She was so worked up.</p> <p>--</p> <p>"Hello, sleepyhead. It's time you got laid."</p> <p>She turned, the night wind blowing through the bedroom curtain. She was wearing tight, yellow, sleeveless, bikini. It was a skimpy little white number with spaghetti straps. The bottom section held a matching yellow mesh. The top was just a thin triangle of fabric barely covering her nipples. Her large breasts sat high on her chest. It's effect was to draw attention to her hard nipples and make them look bigger and puffy.</p> <p>"Hi, honey. I hope you're not worried about me getting in bed with you. I thought we could have more fun."</p> <p>"You're not going to just snuggle up to me, are you? We've gone out to the car for a few minutes."</p> <p>"No we haven't. I love the way you're always thinking of a boy when I'm around and I really don't mind. But since you're a girl you really can't really do that. Can you?"</p> <p>"I guess so. I never thought about going topless. But I guess it's the only way to make me feel good. So if you don't go any further then it won't count as a little guy. Ok honey?"</p> <p>"I guess so. I don't have a problem if you do that."</p> <p>"I was planning on wearing your top again but since you're not in a rush and I'm supposed to make an early night I thought I'd go with a simple blouse and nothing else."</p> <p>"Well I guess you could do that. You just wear that white blouse all night."</p> <p>"You're not going to feel that bad about this if I wear it.
