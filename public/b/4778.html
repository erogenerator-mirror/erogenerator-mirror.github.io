Now you know what the best and only thing I ever did was because you showed up, you are my friend” she answered in her most seductive accent. I just stared at her, my eyes fixed on her chest. She began to talk to me. It wasn’t words, of course I couldn’t hear her, her accent and all, it was just a whisper that she spoke to me on the phone.</p> <p>“Hey, sweetie, what are you doing calling me? It’s just me” she said, with another whisper.</p> <p>She was a few inches away from me now, her eyes so far that my view was up her beautiful shirt, her head close to where she was talking. I could just make out the light of her eyes, I can see every outline of her features, the way she looked, her face. I was still trying to figure out what she was doing. I couldn’t believe what I was doing. She was now talking to me on the phone, but her voice sounded like it came from two miles away.</p> <p>I could do nothing but start to relax and listen.” It was like she said.</p> <p>I guess I was a little startled, I had no idea that I was hearing her speak to me that way. After a moment she looked up at me, a quick look across the faces of everyone she knew that day, I noticed that someone had stopped staring at her as he was talking to her. I tried not to look too much at her however. For a moment I felt that I was caught and I started to panic a bit. Then she turned and looked at me.</p> <p>“Hey sweetie, how are you?” she said in her normal voice.</p> <p>I kept my face straight, I was trying to look friendly and I think that she was trying not to think too much as well. But the truth of the matter was that I wasn’t at all what she had called me. I was sitting at the bar, getting us each a drink. After I had downed mine she came over and sat down on my lap. She seemed to be in a daze, I looked down and saw her head turn in my side. I took in the lovely sight from her hair, down her shoulders, and on down her back. Her neck was so beautiful, so thin, her shoulders were so tight, as was the rest of her.</p> <p>“Hey, it’s cold I thought you were cold” she spoke softly. Her voice was sexy and seductive, I was trying to hide in my head and just look around at the other people in the bar with them.</p> <p>She sat there with her head on my chest. Her hand came over to sit on my shoulder. I held her with my free arm and we sat there talking for a bit, I didn’t know how long I was watching her, but we were probably having a good time with these other people all of a sudden. I didn’t want to talk as she spoke to me, I was concentrating on her talking to me, but I couldn’t stay away. She finally broke the silence after a few moments.</p> <p>“I’m sorry I didn’t mean to keep talking” I said, not realizing what I was saying.</p> <p>“You are not a little girl anymore, you are a little princess” she smiled. “But you know what, just go with it, I don’t care anymore…I have a feeling you are going to be a very good girl.”</p> <p>She said it so softly, like she just loved the sound of it. She leaned forward and kissed me on the cheek. She moved out of my arms and sat back down beside me. We didn’t move from that position we sat, she leaned back into me with her head on my chest again. After a moment she took a sip of her drink and spoke again.</p> <p>“Do you remember my name as a child?”</p> <p>I nodded and she continued.</p> <p>“Do you remember when I was a baby?” I nodded a little harder.</p> <p>“We had such big trees. Mom would take me back then” she said slowly, the tone of her voice was very soft.</p> <p>“Yes... that’s right, I’m your daddy” she said.</p> <p>I noticed that she had put on her shorts, and had removed her shirt, showing a little of her belly. Her arms were still covering them, but she started to unbutton my shirt.</p> <p>“Can I go see if we can go swimming later, daddy?”—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
