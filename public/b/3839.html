I replied, turning away suddenly and rushing into my office to grab one of my spare copies of the document it was all I could think of.</p> <p>As I entered the copy room I looked back over my shoulder hoping to see my wife or brother-in-law doing the same. The day seemed to have taken a different direction in its actions toward me and I was thankful for that; it had taken the right direction as well.</p> <p>On the desk stood my brother-in-law, his shirt off and his arms about his head, looking at various papers and he was still very obviously very turned on by what had just happened, his eyes moving from one photo to the next, his breathing deep and labored at times.</p> <p>"Hey."</p> <p>"Yeah?"</p> <p>"I know how much I enjoyed it." I said giving a slight smile, "You really did something nice last night, didn't you?"</p> <p>"Yeah. I had you all to myself." He replied with a sigh, "I guess I forgot about the other thing."</p> <p>"Uh-hu." I laughed, "I can't help but think what it would be exactly if your brother and I got naked together again and we were both naked and doing the dirty."</p> <p>"I could definitely get used to it." He said, his head hanging to one side, still looking the same as ever. He looked like a complete sexual animal, one being more aware of that side of him at once. He looked a little younger at the end of that statement, and I was sure I was right. After a few moments, he reached over the desk to get a photo and stood it on the computer's keyboard. "Come on, lets go."</p> <p>There was little doubt he was still very horny too. After a few minutes of that he turned his attention to my computer as well, leaving her on the desk for now. I closed the file and took out my own papers to head home.</p> <p>"So tell me about Sam's story." I said turning back and looking at her. I wanted to know what she thought about the way he had been acting toward her. I wanted to get it out and give her a reason for why. I was really afraid she would freak out if I started making a big ass of myself.</p> <p>"I don't think I should tell my story." She said, but there was no need to, I suppose I could understand her desire at first.</p> <p>She had been listening to what my friend had been doing this evening since yesterday, or should I say, since the beginning of the week.</p> <p>"Do tell." I said standing up, walking over to a box of old books. She looked over at me and raised her eyebrows in confusion, then looking back down at the ground she reached out her hand and started pulling at the top of one of my boots. It had been a few days since I had last felt her hands roaming over my legs, and here they were now. It didn't help to feel her hands on me though. I just turned back around to face her and she was already kneeling down in front of me, both of them looking up at me expectantly from the floor.</p> <p>"Uh?"</p> <p>I started moving the boot away from her hand for a few seconds and then took another look at her face. She looked as if she were expecting something, which really wasn't a very difficult thing to do. She still looked shocked by what she had just done, but it wasn't enough that you can deny a stranger that things happen. She still looked frightened, but that didn't stop it, not at the least. I decided to do something different now rather than waiting for her to be a bit more of a player.</p> <p>I got up and came back over to her, my hands cupping her face before she knew what was going on and then pulling her closer. She looked up at me, her eyes wide.</p> <p>"I don't want to be a spectator." I said in a quiet matter of fact tone, "I guess we have nothing to lose anyway." I stepped back a bit more and pulled the other boot away from her body, then taking one step back again; I put my hands on her shoulders and stood there. "I'm a spectator here." I said, a little laugh in my voice. She looked up at me with a questioning look.</p> <p>"How do you know that?"</p> <p>"Oh, I just know. I know what Sam would do or say, and I just don't want to make you feel uncomfortable or anything. If you want to leave that part of your life, you should really at least try getting back to it. It has been long enough, I guess."</p> <p>"Yeah, whatever. Let me get dressed and we can go." She said softly.</p> <p>"No, you must wait for me thereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
