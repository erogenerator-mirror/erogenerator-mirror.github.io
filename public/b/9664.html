I was now having the time of my life and she seemed to like doing the same. I had had my fill of the action, although that was of course, not the whole thing. I was getting very little satisfaction from it during the next bout.</p> <p>Just the thought of my wife's vagina had me aroused, and I began to move on top of her with increasing speed. I just loved her, her body and what it could do.</p> <p>After several minutes of this she came in several more orgasms and then I felt that warm sensation deep in my balls again as she cried out for me to fuck her faster. I did as she asked and soon had my hot juices spewing on to her vagina as I continued to push forward. She continued to rub her vagina up against my cock as I pumped away and soon we both had another climax.</p> <p>I lay on top of her for a long moment and then rolled off as we both felt the weight of our weight on our bodies. I could make out her head on the pillow and her beautiful face as I got up, kissed her on the cheek and we both got up. We went to the bathroom and showered the rest of the night as it was our last night together. We left the hotel the following morning. We went to breakfast before driving to a nearby restaurant for some food. We were sitting at the table when, as we were eating, she handed me the card that we had used yesterday and went inside when we finished our meal.</p> <p>We met in our room that afternoon after lunch. We both felt as if we were living separate lives, our love being expressed and our sexuality communicated in the flesh.</p> <p>Later in the afternoon, as we were finishing our lunch and my erection began to go down, as the afternoon sun began to warm the room, I had her skirt and panties removed and my fingers exploring her vagina. It was now very wet with our love making and she took them off of me with a smile, but she continued to play with my erection.</p> <p>We went back to the room and I turned off the lights for them. We lay down and started kissing and touching each other. We could sense every movement as we touched, kissed and petted each other.</p> <p>Just then we came together in a very strong passion that we could scarcely control.</p> <p>We were in ecstasy as she lay next to me and me in her arms. I looked into her eyes as we kissed and we were lost in that kiss until she turned her head and said, "Shall we try now? I have some new toys to pleasure."</p> <p>To my surprise, just then, we were brought back to reality by several loud sounds of the door to the room turning and we both jumped up and ran over to that door. In a moment, the door opened and we saw Mrs. C. at the door.</p> <p>"Oh, my god! Is that you, Sarah, and Jason?" said Mrs. C. in such a way as if it had been in the past. "Oh my god, is this the two of you and me?"</p> <p>I could feel Mrs. C.'s eyes upon us, and we both burst into laughter as she pulled Sarah into a hug.</p> <p>"It never ceased to amaze me how a woman can have a second opinion, Jason! Why do you ever have to do such a thing?" I wondered aloud as the tears began to fall down my face.</p> <p>"Sarah, I don't know how to tell you this, but I think it is for the best. I could only go along with her reasoning so that we can both have a new experience together." Sarah said to Sarah, "He is a darling guy, sweetheart and he is also a bit of a pain in the ass. And yet, that's what this is all about."</p> <p>She pulled me into a hug, "Honey, this is not a matter of just getting acquainted. I have always been aware of how it is different when we love each other and that is still very new to me. And yes, I am quite comfortable letting the two of you fuck each other at least once in a while."</p> <p>Sarah went on to say, "There could be a difference between your love for me and his lust for you."</p> <p>"Sarah," I said softly, "you are a very beautiful person, and I love you very much for what you have done to ourâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
