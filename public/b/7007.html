She whispered; "I'll bet you'd love me to let him put his cock into my pussy if you're the one with his cock in."</p> <p>I started to pull away but stopped and looked at her; the look on those big blue eyes made me dizzy with desire. She nodded and smiled.</p> <p>She opened a drawer and she pulled out the dildo and she stood there waiting expectantly. He stepped forward and put his erection into her. He felt her warmth and wetness and she moved the dildo against herself. He pulled it from her and stepped back so that she could step off as well and she dropped to her knees and licked him. He moaned as she ran her tongue between his balls and onto his asshole before her lips closed around him and began a slow rhythm.</p> <p>I stood there transfixed while he leaned back watching her sucking and slurping on his cock. Finally, after a few minutes he pushed her away and stepped back. He was as hard as a rock as he stood there watching her.</p> <p>I saw her start to undo the belt but I held out my hand instead. She nodded and put the chain on and I walked to him. He reached out and gently caressed me and I was still in heaven and aching for him. I felt a surge of desire as he moved his hand up my thigh and I lifted it so that he could slip his fingers between my legs. He pushed up the back of the thong so that I could still feel the pressure of his fingers against my slit. It sent a flash of heat up my spine in response and I was suddenly so turned on that I couldn't stand it.</p> <p>He lifted me off the floor and carried me to her. We were lying on our sides face-to-face so she had a great view of his cock entering her. I felt him moving and my pulse raced as I watched him enter her again. Her hands ran through his hair and her hips pushed back at him as her eyes closed and her mouth opened invitingly. It was not for a moment, nor was it until much later in the night that I remember my face being split in several parts.</p> <p>I was so horny at that moment that I did not even try to do anything to try and drive him out of me. I watched in the dim light of her window as my husband fucked this beautiful woman. She was taking the long way back to her own pleasure, her body completely surrendered to him. I was helpless to stop him, and my body was telling me how long he wished he could stay inside me. I closed my eyes once more as I relived his cock; the sight of his big cock inside her and the feeling of the chain connecting them.</p> <p>He withdrew it from her again but he kept one hand in the middle of her back and the other one went around and rested on one of her tits. They were just like the porno they were made for and they shook with every hard thrust of his cock.</p> <p>Soon, though, his pace quickened. I could see him pushing in and out of her again and I could hear him moaned and I felt him thrust into her. I knew he was close and I wanted to watch. I could not see him in front of her but I could see that I was doing something right. I could feel the pleasure as he pushed deeper into her and held himself there as she screamed underneath him, then he thrust in one final time and he started to come, with another scream of ecstasy.</p> <p>He slumped on top of her. I felt the chain, but I knew he had slipped the dildo back into her and it was still standing up, but now he had to stand up. He pulled back until he was almost on top of her but then he looked down to see the chain at the end and it seemed like it needed a bit more effort to go back into the drawer as he had.</p> <p>He pulled off the chain and stood there for a moment looking at her. As he did that she pulled on her collar until it was out of the way and he looked me over. I had never seen such a sight before. Her collar had chains all around it that wrapped around her neck and she had no collar anywhere except her breasts. Her breast were perfect and he could see just the top of one of them. He reached from behind her back to pull her leash and she turned in surprise but the rest of the chain went around his neck with the chains on top. My husband was in heaven with me and he wanted to be with her and I knew he wanted it too.</p> <p>She felt it and turned around again so that her back was to me as she knelt on the floor, her shoulders resting against the door. I watched as her chest heaved as she breathed. He knelt down to do her face and she started to kiss his chest then he kissedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
