I was going to find my escape so I could run to safety. That's where we were headed.</p> <p>I stopped, turned, looked away, and ran as fast as I could. I saw stars, and felt myself getting weaker. I was starting to collapse, but I continued to run, and found myself standing in the middle of the parking lot, just five feet from the school.</p> <p>"God I'm exhausted," I said, collapsing backward into a sitting position on a bench. This time I wouldn't have to stand up to continue, but I did.</p> <p>I sat on the bench, took a breath, and opened my eyes. There was a young girl standing in the doorway, staring at me. Her hair was messed and smeared. Her eyes were still wide, but they seemed to be blinking as she caught sight of me.</p> <p>"Oh, hi sweetie," she said, staring up at me, still not making eye contact, "I saw you coming home, so I got off the elevator. I don't think I know if you have an extra key for that.</p> <p>"Thank you," I said, hoping that would be the end of the conversation, but I wouldn't have said it just yet. I was also hoping that she hadn't seen me come inside.</p> <p>She was looking at me again. I'm not sure what she saw, but whatever it was I could tell that it had caused a bit of a ruckus.</p> <p>"What'd you think of me?" she asked. I didn't know what she was looking at, but I didn't really care.</p> <p>"I think you're a really sweet girl," I said, trying to sound upbeat, but my voice still sounded strained, "I've really been looking forward to playing with you."</p> <p>"Really?" she asked, "I've heard a lot of girls like you, and it's nice to hear them liking you. I've heard a lot of girls say that they want to try girls, and you know how girls are never willing to let them try girls. That's not true!"</p> <p>I looked down. I had gotten lost in her gaze again, and it was affecting me. And then my eyes went wide again. I didn't mean to come back that fast.</p> <p>"What's wrong?" she asked, obviously concerned, but looking up, "I thought you came looking for me."</p> <p>The thought of talking like that with this girl made me smile. She was obviously upset at the way things were turning out. But I'd have to take it to heart once and for all. So I looked up again and saw her looking as well.</p> <p>"I don't know what I thought coming home early, but I came home early to find you sitting in front of the TV with another girl," I explained. We both laughed, but I think she didn't mind at all, maybe she hadn't realized that she didn't look in the way to get a good look.</p> <p>"How could you come home early?" she asked.</p> <p>I smiled. At least she knew that there was someone home, and she was looking up to get something from the kitchen. I nodded, still smiling.</p> <p>"I'm not home because of the game," I said, "I'm home because I'm here because I was really tired out earlier, and I woke up early to do some homework for finals when I'd gone to bed. That's why I woke up early and came to the living room to find you sitting on the couch in jeans and a t-shirt, and a smile on your face," I said, smiling again, "and I found your hand there already."</p> <p>She smiled at me. Then it got weird. I had a feeling she was staring at me but she couldn't have, because she was still looking up, because she was still looking up!</p> <p>"Well," I said, "I saw you come in and see this but you were probably lost in the crowd. So you didn't catch me. Sorry. I'm usually pretty good at knowing what shows to listen to. But I always kind of think to myself, "if you have a crush on me, come on get it on with me," and then that doesn't sound so bad. But I wasn't expecting anyone. I'm sure you can tell that I know, but it doesn't matter."</p> <p>After a moment I changed my train of thought. I felt better.</p> <p>"I'm still mad at you," I said, "I told you how much I like you, and you think I'm a nice guy, so I told you that I've never really been into the dating scene. So I've never been with a man since I came here.
