You know that?" she said.</p> <p>He nodded at that. In truth, she was quite impressed with what they had done to her. She had always loved that so much. Not that the whole experience was that of a gangbang, but she liked to do it for him whenever and however he wanted. She couldn't say that for a long time after being turned loose, but she wasn't complaining.</p> <p>"You think? Would you like to take me on a trip like this with my husband?" she queried.</p> <p>"Hmmmm. A whole trip like this?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes. Just for you."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>It didn't take long. He climbed on the bed and sat down on the edge. She straddling his lap, lowering herself onto him. Her hands were on his shoulders as she leaned her head back on his shoulder. He wrapped his arms around her waist. They both kissed just as passionately as they had just before they got into the shower. She felt her lips being nibbled on. She was soooo wet and slippery. She could feel his hands caressing her ass. He was so strong. Soon he was licking and probing her pussy with the tip of his tongue. It didn't take long at all for her to climax again. He felt her quiver on his face. He slowly moved into her again. Their kissing was like the first one they'd had all night.</p> <p>She knew that he couldn't last too long because he started rubbing her through her orgasm. He was so soft as he slid up into her. She wrapped her legs around his waist as he stroked her against him, rubbing her from her knees to her neck. Her breasts were hanging there, her nipples erect. They were beautiful. He had to have a mouth on them, she was moaning. They got hotter as they felt each other. It was heaven.</p> <p>"Oh, baby. I haven't had a good cock in a long time. I've missed this." He was getting into it now and had a bit trouble breathing. As long as he kept stroking her, he didn't want to come yet. She wrapped her arms around his neck, kissing him so passionately.</p> <p>"I want to do you right now. I want to feel that lovely cock of yours inside of me."</p> <p>"Anything for you." came from him and they really didn't talk much as they rocked and kissed. She didn't remember it. But that night at the hotel, before the night started, when she was a little more open to the sexual activities, and when the other two guys fucked her, she remembered it too.</p> <p>After kissing and fucking for over an hour, she realized that she was completely on display in the shower and she was very excited. She felt his cock as hard as granite, rubbing against her through the thin material of the towel. She reached down and took her hands away from him as he held her. He kissed her neck again, his hands now exploring everywhere within reach of his tongue. She spread her legs willingly on the outside of the towel as he was stroking her so wonderfully.</p> <p>He took his cock away from her and slowly slid all the way down until he bottomed out inside of her. He was so very happy for her when he was in the limo. It felt marvelous. He fucked her slowly now, loving the way she was moaning and writhing beneath him. She was so tight. He was getting close and he wanted to come quickly. He wanted to feel her come when he was inside her with his load. He wanted to make her feel like she'd had a million orgasms already. He wanted to make her feel like she'd had hundreds. She was tight and it felt incredible, she was wet, she was ready, she wanted him to make her come time after time. His cock was throbbing hard and ready.</p> <p>"Oh. Yeah. That's it baby, come with me. Come with me. Fill me up."</p> <p>Her words were lost to his thrusting. She was lost and not even sure if she was still moving as her body responded immediately. She was like a wild woman riding a bucking bronco. He knew it wouldn't be long before he made her lose control again. He lifted her off the ground and carried her to the bed. She was still on her back, legs spread and legs up in the air. He could not believe how tight she felt under his hands, her pussy tight around him. It was like she was waiting to make herself come again. She felt him stroking her, making his last few strokes.</p> <p>"Oh. Oh. That's so good."</p> <p>She felt his hands on her inner thighs squeezing them as he stroked her and pumped into her. He knew that she should be doing somethingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
