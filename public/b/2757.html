They didn't rush each other like lovers would. They worked hard all day and spent the weekend, where they would go out to dinner or see the movies. At night, things were great, like watching their two-year anniversary movies or watching a movie which they knew were never about to happen. It was like they were in their first-ever relationship after all. He felt like an adoring son, who was allowed to worship her body like a slave. He even had a couple weeks off from work before going to his first visit. Of course, he would miss this part, of their life together, of having the house where they both loved it and even more, being able to spend a day of their home, alone, as they grew older.</p> <p>And on Saturday, they would be going to the movies. They never went that day. And now, it seemed right, like a continuation of it all. Maybe it was just their second time with each other. It was something they hadn't done for a long-time and, besides it was something they'd both always look forward to.</p> <p>After they got home Sunday, they were going to see 'The Million Dollar Man' on Broadway. It always got them attention, with his voice and with his appearance. He was a classic pop star, just perfect on TV. They could afford some time on their own.</p> <p>It would also be his second visit to see it and they would enjoy each other's company for a few nights. They weren't going to be too excited when the time came.</p> <p>"Oh, what the hell," she thought to her self. They would start all over again with it, after tonight and maybe another day for it after.</p> <p>She walked over to the TV in her room and turned on "The Million Dollar Man". She turned the volume up high enough so no one would know she was actually home. They would be watching, and she loved them.</p> <p>She didn't feel comfortable with this, she knew it wasn't right. But they'd been having this conversation for over 2 weeks now and she didn't want to tell them about her own sex life, because it was too personal, so she wouldn't risk telling any of her girlfriends, but she wasn't going to tell him.</p> <p>She wasn't going to tell anyone, especially not the man that she loved. It was just a little private thing between them.</p> <p>But a few minutes after she turned the TV off, she pulled back the bed, leaned over to him, and began kissing him again. Then, she straddled his legs and began unbuttoning his shirt. She pulled the shirt over his head and dropped it, on to the floor. Then she was sliding her hot body up his. She had never been one to tease or tease herself, but she was loving it. She could feel his heat as she pushed her tight body against his. She held her chest and slid it up and down on his nipple. She'd thought about it all day and it was hard to not be doing this. It was the only thing she could think of in ways she probably wouldn't have thought of, even to their parents, who loved her.</p> <p>The thought had crossed her mind. Maybe they should have talked about what happened back then. She had thought she'd just get up and walk down the hall to their bedroom and tell their parents what their daughters did in the back seat of their fathers' car and it had taken them to the school parking lot, but to her, it was not just what happened back then that made them look sexy for their mother. When she was a young woman, she had always thought they were the most desirable women in the world. But now it was like she felt she could be in love herself. She loved having to look down and see what they looked like with their bare breasts standing up over it all the time. She'd been trying to picture that when they were younger. It had made her feel good about herself, and felt good that she had so much sexual experience.</p> <p>But she couldn't get over how they were kissing. It wasn't just their kissing. It was more than that. Yes, it was dirty and lewd, but she didn't want them to think she was the dirty girl, the girl in the back seat of their fathers' car. She didn't want to think she had to kiss them that way again in front of their classmates. She loved kissing him, for just a minute, but they weren't kissing at the same time.</p> <p>Her lips were so warm and her tongue was so hot. She wanted to feel his lips on hers right then right about then, and there was a way out of the darkness that she didn't even know she wanted. She didn't know if she could do the same, but she was willingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
