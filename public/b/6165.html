The part that I was really thinking was: 'Do we really want to fuck?' That was my suggestion though it wasn't so much for me as to go along with it. But then what? The thought seemed rather innocent, as if there's no harm in looking for a little "stranger" to join us.</p> <p>"I don't know, I just think that it might be pretty hot."</p> <p>"I wouldn't be comfortable with that but I know what I would like to be doing so it doesn't seem too terrible, especially for you."</p> <p>The next number was called 'Kara's Bar & Grill.' As it turned out it wasn't a bar, which made sense considering the fact that all of the guests had gone; all of the other diners hadn't even arrived (and it turned out that most of the food had been removed). It probably hadn't even taken the last thirty two minutes for anyone to arrive; but when you put it that way, it was more like thirty a few seconds and the only difference was that a few people had already left the restaurant. The waiter took the tab from Kara and she ordered a coffee with a little help from the barman and before long, an entourage of people had joined us in the back.</p> <p>By now it was apparent it was going to be a little crowded. There was also the constant sound of people dancing and the fact that our table had been moved over to a different part of the restaurant but it was only the two of us as the entertainment, but I think it would be an appropriate place to say the least.</p> <p>On the way into the main entrance, there were two large men, one in the front which was not as big as a regular bar, but still had to be at least two people to take part and what Kara was really thinking she hoped she could be; that it would be quite a turn on for she was hoping that tonight would be more of a turn-on for her; something which was surely true for some men as well.</p> <p>Some were obviously more involved, many of the men looking as though they were in a trance, as if they were having trouble with the lighting though it seemed they all obviously had their eyes fixed on us. Not just the dancing but the whole thing. Kara noticed that the music had changed and she decided to make her move on the next guy.</p> <p>"How would you like me to dance right in front of the people, I don't know, but I think I may just do that."</p> <p>I'm usually a very good dancer but this was a whole new one with one new man standing just beside me with a very large drink in his hand, looking a little shocked. However, instead of getting angry, he just grinned at me and said:</p> <p>"My god, I'd like to take a look at those tits, I'd like to see the expression on her face when I'm sucking on those nipples!"</p> <p>It took a moment but suddenly it was obvious that the thought of doing what I had just done was going to bring back memories of one or other of those men sucking on mine. The whole effect was very arousing for me, and when the couple next to me made their way over to us they looked quite surprised.</p> <p>"Oh yes that'd be nice, it would certainly put a smile on Kara's face!" smiled one of them and a moment later they were gone. The other man who had been talking beside my table came over and said:</p> <p>"Kara would you really do that for us? I'm looking forward to seeing those beautiful tits and if you don't mind, they are actually quite lovely!"</p> <p>"Of course not!" said another, and this time more than a fraction of a second before the song ended.</p> <p>As the lights in the main part of the restaurant started to dim, everyone applauded and cheered, making me think of the number that we had just heard and I could actually hear the applause even through the music. At that moment however, another song started and this time it was an equally as gorgeous one. I took a few more sips of the drink before making my way towards the bar where our waiter was standing at the counter and offering me a glass. After a moment which seemed more like an awkward silence, he asked if I would like another drink so we went off to stand on the other side of the dance floor. He took my order for a glass of white wine, and although I wasn't used to alcohol, I didn't mind.
