I wanted to wear a sexy nightie that I knew I would not be embarrassed about. I picked up my panties from the pile and put them in my shorts and top on, just in case the guys from the party kept looking in my direction and came over.</p> <p>I was surprised to see them there so early. I always thought I was pretty much a little more than I had before, but that changed after we finished lunch, and I was so grateful for the opportunity to find some underwear that hadn't been in my hand in years. I put on a very light pink lacey bra with just a hint of lace covering my breasts and a little lace edge around the waistband of the bikini panties.</p> <p>I went into the living room in my bra and top to find the guys in line in the back, and they were just sitting there. I didn't know if I should get dressed up, and wondered if I should bring a change of clothes, but then I heard, "Your turn." Before I could make the decision, the guys stepped out to the line, and I felt a big hand reach around my back and grab a handful of my hair, pulling me against the line of guys. One of the men behind me got a handful of hair and pulled my neck back as he pulled my hair, causing my hair to fall forward. I didn't know what to do, and turned to get my panties caught the men's eye. I had a couple of short flashes of that bra and panties being torn in half, so I just grabbed the panties with my other hand to show everybody I was bare beneath the soft layers of fabric.</p> <p>"See anything you like, honey?" I felt some eyes on me and a few in the background who were watching me in more than just a skirt.</p> <p>"Oh, I do, you look amazing," I heard one of the guys say, and I saw a smile come to his lips. "Are you a little slut?"</p> <p>He said that word out loud with such arrogance that I almost jumped it.</p> <p>"What's that mean?" I asked.</p> <p>"Say it," he said, and he pushed my skirt up around my hips, revealing those sexy panties. I felt his hands slide under her panties, brushing past her smooth skin with the tips of his fingers, all the way up to a point just below her clit. He gave my hips a push that resulted in the material of her panties pulling tight over her pussy, and another few moments of his fingers massaging her pussy lips before pulling them away from her body. I felt his fingers pressing against her hole, and I saw her moan in a mix of pleasure and pain.</p> <p>"Do you feel what you're doing to yourself?" I heard him say as he pushed a second finger into her.</p> <p>"Oh, god, I'm so turned on," I heard myself say. "I don't think I can take any more."</p> <p>"You can't get enough?"</p> <p>She didn't answer me; instead she just smiled and gave me a quick kiss. I saw her turn around, her blouse falling to her shoulders, and then she gave her backside a little wiggle and her pants fell from her hips, exposing the top of her panties to the crowd.</p> <p>"Your turn," I heard a man say. "Are you still a virgin?"</p> <p>I heard another guy say the same thing, but then the man's words had me squirming in my seat. I could feel a hand grabbing my backside roughly, holding me there with his strong hand on my backside, then his fingers rubbing down.</p> <p>"You've got to try not to get too excited," one of the guys said, as his hand pushed into her panties, grabbing her ass.</p> <p>I heard my wife answer this by lifting herself on her elbows and putting her feet on the sides of his chair, exposing her completely to the crowd, and then lifting her hips to offer him some help in the process. With her face at the level of his groin, her panties still in his hand, and her breasts now hanging out of her bra, my face was still in her panties, and her lips parted. I heard her moanâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
