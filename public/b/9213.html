Because I'm not so sure my performance will show that I have something so special to show." she whispered seductively.</p> <p>"Nope, I'm not going to watch anything tonight, but only have a few more to teach you," he said, "You've done an incredible job."</p> <p>"I can't believe I agreed to let this happen. I'm so scared." she said softly.</p> <p>He continued to caress her breasts, his fingers slowly trailing the sides of it, teasing the nipples with his fingernails, before taking them out and rubbing his hands against them, "Then I thought you might prefer having my tongue in your pussy. I knew you had a special pussy, I bet you could really make it feel better than mine."</p> <p>She didn't care that this was the first time she'd shown anyone else what was really on her mind. She just loved the way he touched her breasts. It was as if he understood how this felt about her. Even if she hadn't agreed to this, she didn't want to do this. She needed him. She wanted his cock in her, her pussy, even her ass right then and there, but it was still very much a surprise. She still felt like a virgin when they started, and now she felt her virginity taken away, not that she really had.</p> <p>In a moment he picked her up, and she wrapped her legs around his waist as they laid on the chaise lounge, his erection pointing upward. It was now her turn to sit on him, he thrust himself up into her from an angle, her back coming to rest against his chest as he held her close. The only barrier remaining was the small strip of cloth that covered her pussy.</p> <p>Just seeing her face while she sat on his cock was like seeing a rare treat. It was the most beautiful sight to see.</p> <p>After he got up he sat her upright on him, then he bent down to kiss her, "Mari I am going to make you feel good. Now just relax, it is not the first time, and I'm sure it will be just as good again."</p> <p>With that he started the slow torture that was a first time for most of the girls of school, the first time he'd ever been with anyone. And it was an extremely special first time. He pushed himself up into her and pressed his hips down, sliding deeper into her.</p> <p>He reached back, grabbed her hips, and slowly pulled out of her. He continued to thrust back into her. Soon he was sliding almost out again, then back into her, filling her completely.</p> <p>Finally after several minutes he leaned his weight down onto her and kissed her lips, "You'll want to feel loved again," he growled into her ear.</p> <p>Mari was amazed for a moment when she heard that.</p> <p>"Oh my, that was amazing. If only the boys you sent to college could do that. I can't believe they'd ever do that," she whispered, in a small, unsure voice.</p> <p>"It is what it is, and you're special, and it sounds like you enjoyed yourself," he responded, as he started to thrust back into her again.</p> <p>"No, it's not what you think. There's more." she whispered with her lip caught between her teeth as he thrust into her again and again.</p> <p>It wasn't long before he pulled his hands away from her hips, and used them to bring her toward the other side of the chaise, as he sat on the edge of the chaise chair.</p> <p>"How are you thinking?" he asked as he sat her back down on the chaise.</p> <p>"I'm a virgin too, but I'm afraid of what I'll get if I disappoint you," she said as she leaned back to spread her legs. "How am I going to know if you're going to make me do that? What if he thinks it's a bad idea or is it even really bad? If I disappoint you we'll go crazy, and I will be sorry," she explained as she wrapped her arms around her legs in an effort to prevent it from happening, "and I'll know that if it turns me on."</p> <p>"You have no idea what it's like having you do that too." he replied with a chuckle.</p> <p>He had now moved off of the small piece in the lounge, his fingers running down her sides and underneath the table clothâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
