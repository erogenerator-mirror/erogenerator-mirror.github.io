I could taste the salty pre-cum from his dick and I liked doing this just as much as the other way around. I was pleased with the fact that my lips were stretched around his shaft and it didn't take long for him to be fully hard. I was also pleased to find that my own dick, which was starting to leak, was still very erect by that point.</p> <p>I pulled off and quickly got onto my knees in front of him, my dick bobbing out of the pool of juices that had collected on the end of his dick. He reached down and spread my cheeks for me, allowing me better access as he took each of my cheeks back in his small hands.</p> <p>"Your asshole is amazing, but I think I could have it any time I wanted", he said as he ran his right hand over my hole and inserted two of his fingers into my hole.</p> <p>"Yeah, if I ever wanted to I wanted to keep it that way."</p> <p>"You got it", I grinned at him, and lowered my mouth down onto his dick once again.</p> <p>He slid in easily and moaned, then I moaned with him and slid down over his shaft, which he put on my face. He held the back of my head and thrust me down on his dick, which was thicker than my previous dick, which he began to fuck my mouth, shoving it completely in and out between us.</p> <p>As I was sucking on him my hands found another place, and as I began to fondle his balls and rub my own cock, he began moaning, which I found a little arousing. I tried to push my face back down but he held my head, and instead, he began to fuck my face faster, which brought me to the edge. I felt that warm feeling inside me, that moment when my orgasm hits me in waves, with a loud grunt, I came, my body spasming and jerking.</p> <p>He slid out of me and laid on the concrete, pulling me into his arms. He told me, "That was amazing!!! I've come to get laid!"</p> <p>"Yeah," I grinned, "I thought about it just now, but I didn't want to stop."</p> <p>"Yeah, I understand." He replied.</p> <p>We kissed some more, then got dressed and drove home to our respective homes. We decided to go to his house and fuck for a couple hours before he decided to go to work in the morning, before he had to go to bed. We got ready to go and he grabbed my hands, and led me by the hand to the door. He opened it then and invited me in and we went to our own rooms.</p> <p>He quickly put his pants back on and went over to his closet, and pulled a couple things out. We kissed then we got into the bed. "I'm going to teach you just how I know how to make a woman feel good", he said as he put his finger to my mouth.</p> <p>"Good idea", I replied, kissing him passionately as he brought his dick back to life.</p> <p>We were still in bed before I was able to return his kiss, and we fell back onto the bed, still entwined. I felt so sexy and so wanted.</p> <p>He started to tell me how to make him feel good.</p> <p>"I've been waiting for this day for quite a while now."</p> <p>"So much for your first time", I chuckled, "you need a little practice."</p> <p>"Ah, maybe some more practice, but I need you more than just a couple days. You're going to make me cum in about 15 minutes or so with you rubbing my dick," he replied, "But I'm sure you've thought of that."</p> <p>He rolled over and put me on my back, and lifted me into the air.</p> <p>"I'm ready to be fucked, and you're ready to be fucked", he said as he pushed his cock inside me. I started to moan and I looked up at him at the top of my lungs.</p> <p>"You'll have to sit and watch me do this", he said.</p> <p>He then sat down on the bed I was on and got down behind me, placing his hands on both sides of my hips. He started to fuck me with little humping movements, making sure to hit my hole on each motion. I then began to feel something that I couldn't quite put my finger on, so I looked up at him, eyes shut on him, as he continued to thrust his cock inside me.</p> <p>He looked into my eyes as he did this, but it was hard to tell exactly what he was doing with his eyesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
