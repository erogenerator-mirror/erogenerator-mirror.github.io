I said with a huge smile.</p> <p>'Really? What's that got to do with anything?' he asked, smiling back at me. We kissed. We tasted each other. I was tasting the alcohol on him and I was also feeling a little turned on by it. It was exciting yet I wanted this to end badly not that I cared because I'd do anything for him and then I'd leave.</p> <p>We broke the kiss and I looked straight into Tim's eyes and spoke quietly as if I was talking myself.</p> <p>'I never intended to do anything like this with you.' I said, looking him straight in the eye. He just looked at me, his breathing a little more normal.</p> <p>'I don't understand.' he said.</p> <p>'Well I've been here for a while and we've really hit it off... and that's part of it.' I said, 'so tonight I'm leaving.'</p> <p>I got up and headed for the kitchen. As I was moving back with him Tim looked at me and said 'Are you sure?'</p> <p>I looked at him. 'Yeah, I'm sure. It's part of me and I'm not afraid now but I don't think I will be.' He reached over and pulled me towards bed and into his arms. He kissed me and then we fell asleep, spooning as well as spooning and eventually spooning on his bed.</p> <p>**************************</p> <p>I woke up a little before 8.30am, very groggy and really groaning a little. I was still in Tims arms in between the two of us. Eventually I got up and stumbled out of the bed and went and into the kitchen. As I got nearer the front door I saw it was still open, Tim had his arm round me. We both went inside. I sat at the kitchen table. Tim was sitting on the stool. His arm was round me again and his hand was resting on my knee. It was an odd position not normal for a mother and son. That's what I was feeling. I looked at Tim and said 'Sorry, I can't really get up now, I'm starting to get light headed.'</p> <p>'Oh.' He mumbled. I tried to sound as if it was just a 'Morning sickness' but was feeling much better. We started talking. I was still feeling quite groggy and I asked him what he was going to do when I woke up.</p> <p>'No, I've got to go to the pub and have breakfast. Do you want to eat?' he looked thoughtful for a moment then nodded. He got up and went for a shower.</p> <p>Tim watched me the whole time. He looked at me and said 'Have a good day?'</p> <p>I nodded.</p> <p>'And what about...?' I asked him.</p> <p>'Well, I'm sort of busy right now,' he replied. 'It's just us again. I'm trying to sort something out.'</p> <p>'There's nothing out there is there? What are you worrying about?' I asked him.</p> <p>His eyes widened, 'No, don't worry, I don't have anything.'</p> <p>'Doing anything?' I said, laughing.</p> <p>'Well, well, you have got to check that things are okay and everything is... well sort of right?'</p> <p>I nodded and Tim went to the toilet, leaving me to finish breakfast.</p> <p>Tim then came into the kitchen, got up and walked off. 'So you've made up your mind?' he said.</p> <p>I looked at him as if wondering if he was going to say anything. I looked at Tim as a sort of signal.</p> <p>'Okay, you've made up your mind, you can talk to me.'</p> <p>'Why?' he asked. He'd already picked his jacket or was in his pyjamas with his shirt off. I liked where this was going. I could feel my body responding to where Tim was. I couldn't quite believe what had happened. I wondered if all women were like that. Was I becoming attracted to Tim as much as I wanted to be?</p> <p>Tim went on to his front of the table and started speaking. 'Okay, I think you can come up with a few ideas,' he said. 'First we need to get you to come and talk about what happened. And secondly," he looked into my eyes "there are ways to get yourself together again.' He gave a slight shrug. 'I mean your whole sexuality is in a kind of a vacuum. You think about men and what it's like to be a woman. You want to be loved. How'd it be with a woman? And then you can help each other. How'd you doâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
