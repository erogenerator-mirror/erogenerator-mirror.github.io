We were in a taxi on the way into York, in a restaurant at the Ritz. The restaurant was just around the corner from the hotel on the other side of the city. The staff had been very attentive to us and even took our orders which was a bit unusual since no one else was in the room.</p> <p>We sat at a table near the window and a waiter approached the table with his menu. The waiter approached the hotel just as the bellman came out of his room. The hotel was a very modern building, which was a bit large on one side but looked more like the city. The waiter approached with the menu and then the waiter returned, he was just in a suit but I could see him looking at us. He left the menus on the window and then returned with the waiter. He turned towards me and looked at the menu then at the man in the suit, the young man in our hotel.</p> <p>The young man gave the man two menus from a menu he had set out on the table with us. He turned and looked at the young man and then back at the waiter and smiled. From his expression, the young man had a little devil grin too. The waiter handed the menus back to the young man who was walking over to the young man with the two menus waiting. The waiter left and the waiter went to our table. The young man looked at the menu then back at the young man. He opened his mouth an looked at the menu then closed his mouth. The young man stared wide-eyed and then the young man opened his mouth and the waiter put the two menus on the table. Then he reached in the bill and made a small deposit into the hotel room. The young man looked at the waiter then looked at the menu as he took two more menus from the waiter. He then turned towards the young man. The young man looked at him and gave him a look of shock as he smiled. The waiter then reached out his hand and the young man took the two menus.</p> <p>The young man then leaned over and gave us a quick kiss. His kiss was long and passionate with a hint of taste to it. The waiter then turned to follow us. As the waiter followed us inside the restaurant he turned to face us. The young man looked around the room. Then he looked around at what he saw. I was sitting at the table. I had chosen to wear a skirt, which was short enough so that I could sit comfortably comfortably while sitting. The skirt was just a short white shirt tied at the waist. I was sitting with my legs wide apart. The waiter came close to me and I just smiled at him. The waiter then leaned down and kissed me lightly on my lips. I kissed the young man's lips gently and then he stood up. As was about to leave the room the waiter handed us two champagne glasses. He leaned down and kissed me again. He then reached up and brushed his thumb across my ear and I felt a soft and very pleasant wet sensation. I leaned forward and was very aware of the young man behind me. He rubbed the tip of his thumb up and down across my slit. The sensation was like an electric jolt of pleasure.</p> <p>Then the young man whispered into my ear, "You are very beautiful." He said with a softness to his voice.</p> <p>I turned around on the table and the young man leaned forward. His hands were on my knees and his hot breath on my face. He then slid the straps of my blouse from my shoulders and slowly began to slide the fabric of my blouse down. The young man looked at me and then slid his hand up the back of my blouse slowly. My eyes were closed but they widened when I felt the young man's fingertips slip over my bra strap. He then moved the straps off and then moved his hands back to take my blouse completely off. His hands were now resting on my breasts.</p> <p>He whispered, "Are you ready for more?"</p> <p>I just smiled as the young man rubbed and gently tweaked my nipples as his hand slowly worked it's way down along my stomach and around the top of my skirt. After he got the top of the skirt completely off he started to undo his shirt. I looked at him with closed eyes and then leaned forward slightly. Then the young man pulled his shirt up and off. He laid the shirt on the chair and then grabbed my hand and placed it on his lap. I squeezed and slid my hand over his bulge which began to slowly rise at my touch.</p> <p>The young man slipped his hand out of the waistband of his pants and slid his hands down and felt my thighs and bottom. He looked back up at me and then down at my hand which was still moving up and down through his briefs. The young man slid his hand up my legs and pushed the leg of my skirt up so that it was bunchedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
