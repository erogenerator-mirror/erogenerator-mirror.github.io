You are so sweet, how about we get some food in you? I'm starving"</p> <p>"Aaaaaagghhh" she shouted pushing her chest out against me with a grin, "that's better. I'll get some more of that food. We will see how you feel, you'll have to tell me."</p> <p>I followed her out of the kitchen and into the living room. "Do you believe in destiny?" she yelled over the rushing, pounding sound of the rain outside.</p> <p>"Yeah," I said, and she smiled.</p> <p>"But, I don't know about some one else, but, this is only the first day in my life. I'm already so excited and scared I might have to die."</p> <p>"Well come on then, don't just stand there" I shouted, "join me on the couch."</p> <p>She turned and ran into the bedroom with me following almost a mile in every direction. When we entered the living room she stopped, grabbed me by the wrist and led me to the couch with her leading me off into a small corner. She gave me this stern look.</p> <p>"Now go to the front and sit in the middle," she said and then sat on the couch as I sat down in the middle of it. "Lay down on your stomach," she said and I did as I was instructed. She then went to the night stand and came back and selected a black silk robe, "Lay your head back and relax, I'll get the chair ready to put it on now so you can enjoy the view from the back when you are ready." She went back into the kitchen and returned with some towels and some pillows and said nothing further. I lay face down on the pillows as she went to the bathroom. While she was gone, I thought of everything and I began to feel excited. I heard the door open and closed behind her. I was about to say something when I heard the noise of the bathroom toilet flush.</p> <p>"Howdy sweetheart," she called over the pounding sound of the rain outside, "you know what will happen, don't you? You will go out with me tonight."</p> <p>She came back to me and sat down on my stomach facing my feet.</p> <p>"I've been planning how to introduce you to Mr. Johnson, Mr. Anderson, but I don't think that will work yet."</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"Well, he is about 35 and very well built, he has that big round muscle bound look. The hair on his head is much longer than that of most men." She lifted my chin with her hands and brought my face toward hers. Her bright green eyes looked into mine.</p> <p>"Do you like what you see?" she said softly, and then pulled back a little.</p> <p>"Not all of it, but a nice few on me."</p> <p>"Oh, and what's this I hear about Mr. Anderson being a good judge of strength and stamina?"</p> <p>I looked over at her and she smiled.</p> <p>"Well, I'm sure he's strong for his age, but he is also very well-endowed. So, I'm guessing you will be able to tell that he really is that good." I felt her hand gently resting on the top of my head. It was warm and firm.</p> <p>"I'll try Mr. Anderson, but I have a question," she said with a little giggle. It was not one of fear like I experienced from her earlier. "What are you going to wear?" she asked softly. I felt her slide over me and then her thighs on my head as she pressed down very gently.</p> <p>"What do you mean?" I asked again.</p> <p>"Oh, how about I take you someplace where you can just be comfortable without being bothered? So you can really give him time to prepare you. I'll let you try some clothes that you are not allowed to wear, but I'll make sure that he isn't disappointed before putting them on you."</p> <p>"I don't know..." I started to say, but she raised my face up to look into her eyes.</p> <p>"You will have to tell me when you are ready, so you know what you have to wait for me when I am ready for you to be a good girl. I want you to try some of the outfits that you have tried on, especially the little black ones with the long sleeves, and see how they look on you, then if you are interested let me know." She put her arms around my body and slowly lifted up my shirt. I felt the robe fall to the side as she reached up and put her handsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
