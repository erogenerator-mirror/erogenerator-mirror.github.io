She let out and a sigh.</p> <p>"Don't stop," I cried.</p> <p>She didn't stop and her fingers stayed on top of me, working and rubbing the shaft as if it were a real cock. Her tongue went below that shaft. I felt her hot body as it rubbed up against mine.</p> <p>"I can't believe this," she said. I knew she would stop right now. And neither could I.</p> <p>"Fuck, this is amazing!" I sighed.</p> <p>"I know, I know," she replied.</p> <p>I was still working hard and she just watched me. I had to move my hips a mile a minute. It got so big that she had to stop for a minute.</p> <p>"I didn't mean to do it," she said, but her pussy kept rubbing my cock as she laughed.</p> <p>It was really good. Her hands made contact with my body. It was like her body was trying to get more pleasure from rubbing it against me. It felt good. God, I was about to come. My head was in heaven. It took all of my strength to resist.</p> <p>"I don't understand," she said.</p> <p>"I think I can make the next position work," I said. The look on her face spoke volumes.</p> <p>She stood up and bent over on the bed to pick something up.</p> <p>The panties came off easily. They didn't come off and the panties were soaked.</p> <p>I couldn't believe what was happening.</p> <p>She turned around and sat on the bed, her eyes looked at me and her hands still on my shaft. I was standing up and my cock came out of her pussy, it bounced as it was brought right up to her face.</p> <p>"What are you..." she started.</p> <p>"I want you," I said.</p> <p>She looked up at me and smiled.</p> <p>"You already said that," she said.</p> <p>I smiled and said, "What about the rest of it," then smiled at her and said, "I mean right now." I looked down as I slowly started fucking her.</p> <p>She started looking at me with her face and smiled before she said, "Oh, I like what you're doing. I feel so relaxed."</p> <p>I was stroking into her at medium speed. I had not planned to go any faster, but it felt good. Her pussy was so tight.</p> <p>The only other thing I could do was make a little noise as it fucked me. I was trying to concentrate on everything going on in the room and not on the moans from her.</p> <p>As I got to the edge so she could look at me I leaned forward to give her kiss.</p> <p>"Wow," she said. It was kind of nice to see me happy and that really made my cock feel good.</p> <p>"I'm going crazy," I said.</p> <p>"I know," she said in a serious way.</p> <p>"I like that," I said.</p> <p>"I can make this feel even better," she said.</p> <p>"I'm trying," I said. I was trying too hard not to move my hips, but her hands were working on my cock with more strength. I saw her lips wrapped around my shaft while she started working her lips up and down it. I was about to have another orgasm and not to be let up.</p> <p>"I'm so close," I said.</p> <p>She looked up and gave me a smile at the same time I got that final moan she had since that day.</p> <p>"Oh, right there," I said.</p> <p>She started to work even harder and faster. The pace was so good to feel.</p> <p>"I can't hold it much longer," I said.</p> <p>"I can feel you coming!" she said.</p> <p>"I can't, I'm not going to last much," I said.</p> <p>"I know," she said.</p> <p>"Oh," I said, "come on, right there."</p> <p>"I can't, wait!" I said.</p> <p>The feeling of her wet pussy on my cock was better than anything I could have imagined. But she stopped suddenly when she felt the pressure and the speed change. I saw her eyes close but my eyes said that I was hurting her.</p> <p>"Sorry," I said.</p> <p>"No worries," she said.</p> <p>She stood off me and got on all fours on the bed. She put her head down so she was looking at me while she fingered her pussy.</p> <p>I got off the bed, walked behind her and then my cock entered her pussy. It was still throbbing and getting bigger.</p> <p>"Just a moment," I said to her.</p> <p>I took off her panties and got into position near her buttâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
