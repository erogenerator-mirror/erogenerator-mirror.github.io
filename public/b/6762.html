"Let's give it a try." I said finally.</p> <p>"I'll do anything you want," she said softly as we looked at each other then she started to unbutton my shirt pulling it off of me. She unclasped my bra, letting my breasts fall free.</p> <p>She caressed my breasts in those slow, steady motions. Her fingers slid around the stiff nipples and she moved down to caress them with her thumbs. Then she slid her lips down my chest to the navel. Her tongue flicked out to lick my belly button then worked it in an inch away from the top. My knees were shaking.</p> <p>"Ohh...do you think I have enough...?" I moaned.</p> <p>"I think so." She said then she moved her head back up my body to my face. Her warm, smooth lips brushed my cheek and she kissed my lips with a soft but passionate passion. She kissed me firmly and her tongue ran around my mouth, the tip pushing against my lower lip until it opened to her and it began to slip into my mouth. Her hands came through my arms again as my arms lifted to pull her against me.</p> <p>My breasts were soft and warm and as I pulled her in tighter, my nipples hardened in excitement. She reached up and caressed my shoulders and then dropped her hands down to my hips. She began to pull my shirt off of me, tossing it aside.</p> <p>We embraced once again, kissing the same way we did when we were a little younger. I lifted one of her breasts in my hand and it was so soft and soft and I was thrilled to be able to feel her body on mine. I ran my tongue down her throat and across her puckered nipple when I got to it.</p> <p>"Oh God, baby," I gasped against her. We made soft kisses and she took her nipple into her mouth and lightly sucked on it.</p> <p>I moved my body against hers with greater urgency, my nipples rubbing along her rib cage. Our clothes were sliding and sliding along each other until it made a sort of rasping noise. I lifted my feet and we rolled along on the bed before pulling my body up onto hers. Our mouths and tongues were back here together again, fighting for supremacy and I thought I had won the first fight. That's when Carrie rolled us onto our sides, and we snuggled deeper into each others arms.</p> <p>The kissing and rubbing and flicking around on my nipples became more fierce and we moaned and sighed against each other. We both felt it, just the feeling I would soon forget if I tried to keep it up. I could feel her hot breath upon my breasts and I could even feel her tongue licking in a different place the first time. Then she started to kiss around and around my navel. She had to kiss there. As she did mine my body slid against hers and we rubbed and pressed against each other until we were a tangle of breasts and nipples.</p> <p>As our tongues rolled and danced together, sucking and licking at each other she ran her hands all the way down to my hips where she grabbed them forcefully. My ass rolled on her as far as she would let me.</p> <p>Her hips shifted and I felt them press against my thighs as she rose her body up to meet me. Her hot, moist love muscle slipped against mine and as her tongue continued to dance, as she slid up and down on my body, as her pussy ground against mine and as her arms wrapped around me she felt my bare breast crushed against her.</p> <p>I leaned back as I broke the kiss and said, "I think we should stop the kiss."</p> <p>"Oh no," Carrie said. She slid onto her side, spooning our bodies and I moved up so my breasts were hanging over her as she leaned in close to kiss me.</p> <p>"I'm gonna...I want you to do it," I said as our lips met.</p> <p>"Are you sure? Because I...I am more than ready."</p> <p>I rolled onto my side taking her arms off and then slid my body up so our heads were nearly touching. I looked into her eyes and I lowered my lips across hers. Our lips were soft and I could feel the heat of our tongues and bodies. I drew her lips to mine and we licked and sucked against each other for a while until her arms went around my waist and I felt them slide down to the waist of her pants. We felt those as she lifted them. We had never felt them or even heard of them. They were a little large and felt really good to the fingers of our hands. Carrie's hands went inside mine and we pulled them up until we had them tightly in our palms. Then we started to slide them slowly up her body, stopping just long enough to slide her shirt back down and we looked at each other as she slowly slid her hands off of myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
