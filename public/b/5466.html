I felt his body stiffen. Then, still, he stopped fingering himself. He didn't seem very embarrassed or ashamed, but just seemed so damned vulnerable.</p> <p>He asked, "Do you feel bad about what happened?"</p> <p>"Not really, but we're not the first two guys we've been with."</p> <p>"What did happen?"</p> <p>"I told you I was an exhibitionist last night. I didn't expect it to happen this way."</p> <p>I reached over and ran my hand through his hair. "You wouldn't mind at all if we went out some night?"</p> <p>He shook his head. "I don't want to get all dressed up and go out and look like I'm on the prowl, so tomorrow would be okay but next week, if we can arrange to go somewhere, I think we can do that."</p> <p>"So it's okay for me to be naked the first time?"</p> <p>"Sure it is."</p> <p>"If that isn't the reason, then I'm the perfect exhibitionist."</p> <p>"It'll be fun. If I take you too long I will turn you away and you will start to look a little funny."</p> <p>"Do you want to be naked with me, or do you want to go somewhere after this?" "Let's go somewhere."</p> <p>"The place is open," he said.</p> <p>"It is," I said. My body relaxed for the first time in months, then I looked at him and asked, "Does that mean I need to put on a skirt?"</p> <p>"Definitely."</p> <p>I sat there for a moment and contemplated the situation that had occurred to me last night. I thought if I had sex with some man, then I certainly wouldn't have to wear something. Yet that isn't the sort of thing as an exhibitionist is. I had sex with a man last night, and the thought of it made me feel a certain amount of guilty. I didn't feel like I had much control over my body, but there are a few things I do, and I know I would like to let this go any time soon. I decided I was ready for him to go.</p> <p>I went toward him. His erection was poking out from his jeans. I pulled the zipper tab down and saw a bulge. I moved toward him and sat astride him, rubbing my pussy lightly against his thigh and stomach. "I don't want to be an exhibitionist so soon."</p> <p>His hand moved toward the waistband of my dress and his fingers grazed my pussy. I leaned back against him and felt a hand go underneath the dress, and then up between my legs. I was ready, but not wet yet, so he rubbed me and soon I was moaning. I pushed my lips up against his mouth and he kissed me, then pulled off my panties. I felt him put his finger against the outside of my pussy, then his middle finger slide in. I gasped. His finger made a circle on my clit and he kept it that way for a minute. I was so wet it was actually painful, and he started to move his middle finger in and out of me slowly. When I started to like that, he did circles several times and started to slowly speed up.</p> <p>"Put a rubber on."</p> <p>I rolled over onto my back. I had wanted to get on top before in our relationship, to get him to go in deeper and touch my inner most feelings and feelings I might normally experience while we were in bed. I was a bit worried that he might get carried away and hurt me, but he didn't, and this was all his business. I started to pull my dress up and as I did so, he started kissing my inner thighs and when his mouth reached my pussy, I felt it grow wetter and I moaned softly. He opened up a button on my dress and slipped his tongue out and I felt the inside of it slide into my pussy, while I continued to rub myself and I felt his tongue touch the outside of my leg at the edge. I turned my head and looked at him and he nodded.</p> <p>I wanted to take his face in my hands and pull him up against me, but I couldn't move. He looked so vulnerable. But then as I was looking him in the eye, I just smiled, turned around and lay on my back on the bed and pulled him up on top of me. I spread my legs slightly and he slipped in between them. He stopped, kissed my inner thighs, and started to slide himself in and out against my swollen lips. He moved his hand between my legs and began to rub me from behind. Every so often he would touch my hole and make circular motions along the crevice and he would suck and lick my clit some to makeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
