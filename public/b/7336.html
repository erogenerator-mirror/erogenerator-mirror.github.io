She reached for my cock again, but I grabbed her hand instead and quickly let her continue on. The feel of another woman's lips surrounding my cock was unlike anything I had ever felt. All her soft luscious lips were now a dark contrast of skin and hair that was a light tan with soft curves just like hers. She looked like a woman who had just received the most wonderful reward of all. I looked down at my erection and it was pointing towards her mouth. She smiled, and wrapped her hand around me again, looking at it, and then sucked me into her mouth. A strange feeling ran through my stomach as her tongue played around the head. Her mouth was warm and soft, with just enough suction that I knew if I let her take my dick out I would cum in her mouth.</p> <p>A part of me knew there was no turning back at this point. I pulled her face away from me and said, “I love you so much Lisa,” as I moved her head towards me and pushed it back towards my groin. She looked up at me with loving eyes. I ran my hand down her face and pulled her hair back into the ponytail in front of her face then ran my fingers over her lips and down her neck and chest. As she rubbed my cock with her hand while she licked me, I said, “Do you feel wet or sticky in there baby, and have you come up here and fuck me?”</p> <p>She lifted her hand from my penis as she nodded her head yes, still working on her clit. I knew it wasn't going to be much longer before my balls had exploded, and I wanted nothing more than to sink my cock into that hot mouth of hers. This was what I loved about her, she was always in control and could go any time of the day or night. I gently kissed her face one final time, and said, “I love you, Lisa.”</p> <p>I looked down at her body and found her eyes staring up at me, and she had one hand pulling her nipples. I slid my legs out from under me, and with them spread her legs apart. Lisa looked up at me and said, “Can I help?” I smiled and nodded and then slid my rock hard cock into her hot box. Her body shook with pleasure each time my cock pushed it’s way into her.</p> <p>“Oh God, that feels like heaven!” I said as she closed her eyes and leaned back into me. She lifted her legs higher as I kept my hips pumping in and out of her as she felt my cock sliding deep in her. I loved listening to her moaning as she came and it reminded me how beautiful she really was. Now the sensation of her cunt was so different from how she looked, and she was completely different to my sister. My body seemed to jump with my climax, and I held her steady as the warmth of my orgasm spread out past us. I could feel Lisa’s cunt contracting and squeezing around my cock to make a 'squeeze' as her pussy went through multiple orgasms. I kept going and pushing my cock into her until I had finished cumming and she fell forward onto my shoulders. Her breasts pressed against my chest as she lay gasping for breath. Her body and mine were covered in sweat. She reached to hug me tightly, but I stopped her hand quickly.</p> <p>“No, let’s shower,” I said as I pulled her body to mine, and we kissed again. “I don’t know if we should have ever shared the shower we just had, you know.”</p> <p>“We didn’t have sex, “ she said.</p> <p>I laughed as I pulled her into my arms and told her, “No, that was a one time thing, and thank God for sex like that with someone you don’t know.”</p> <p>Lisa had fallen back to her original position on the bed, and as we turned she said, “No, I was right after all,” and then pulled me to her. I pulled her body closer to mine and looked lovingly into her eyes. We shared that deep gaze for a moment, before I kissed her again, and said, “I love you to Lisa,” as I began to rock my hips back and forth.</p> <p>“Yes,” she said, and I felt her fingers comb through my hair as she pulled me close to her. I stopped and pulled us apart. I held her eyes as I asked, “What’s next?” Her eyes were questioning, and I knew she wasn’t going to answer. After all, where was this going?</p> <p>“I was just wondering, would you mind if we shower some more—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
