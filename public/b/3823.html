I couldn't possibly be this good in bed." She kissed him for another minute and then added, "Can you be like this and not do the thing you're thinking about?"</p> <p>"It's not that."</p> <p>"That's not what you're saying."</p> <p>"It's not?"</p> <p>"It's not that."</p> <p>"If we're going to do it, what do you want me to do?"</p> <p>"Anything."</p> <p>"Oh, I do, too."</p> <p>"What about this?"</p> <p>"Whatever you want. Just ask. Please."</p> <p>"I can't think about that, not in this morning, anyway." His words were all she needed for now. She leaned back, turned to face him, and took him in.</p> <p>"I think we want another long kiss."</p> <p>He took her, slowly at first, then more passionately. His kisses were more focused and he pulled her up to wrap his arms around her body. His hands, like all the rest of him, were at ease with her. She was breathless, his touch was gentle. His lips touched her neck and there were murmurs that were more of need and desire. They kissed and kissed.</p> <p>"Take me upstairs. Take me again."</p> <p>"No, we don't have to."</p> <p>"No, we have to. We don't have to go to jail."</p> <p>She was trembling and he was still standing as she bent down to the carpet. At his command, she stepped into the light and found herself in a bedroom decorated with dark wood furniture. He was standing next to the bed, his back to her. "Lie down."</p> <p>"Yes. I can lie down now."</p> <p>"No. I want you to lie down."</p> <p>"No, I can't."</p> <p>"Do it," were the only words he said, as he pulled her back onto the edge of the bed and stood back, his legs on both sides of hers. He kissed her and then slipped her bra down so she could feel him. She felt him at the front and felt him moving his hands to his pants. Just the tips of his fingers brushed her nipple as he moved them over her body. He was on her first, and she felt him inside her, pressing her against the bed, and then his mouth joined with hers again, this time their tongues mingled.</p> <p>"I want you," he said.</p> <p>He kissed her mouth again, his eyes closed, and then his mouth was gone.</p> <p>He knelt down next to the bed. She saw her dress lying on the floor and his hand reaching toward it, then back and away from her again.</p> <p>"It's too much."</p> <p>"It's not too much," he said quietly, his voice husky.</p> <p>"It might be," she agreed.</p> <p>He reached out to stroke the hair on her cheek with more than just one finger. She felt the softness there. When he touched her mouth again, his eyes closed for a moment, and he kissed her again. It wasn't a tongue kiss, more a long, wet kiss, but it moved into her and she could feel it.</p> <p>"You know, there have been a lot of times in the past that I've loved."</p> <p>"No, I don't think that's true. I really do. But we've already been through with the past that I could never have."</p> <p>"I do. I love you."</p> <p>"I love you," he repeated, but this time his voice was deeper, more passionate.</p> <p>He kissed her again, his tongue moving into her mouth. She kissed his lips back passionately and her arms rose as high as they could reach. He didn't seem to care what they were doing, his lips remained firmly on hers and his tongue moved into her mouth. She knew it. It felt as though she could feel it and the intensity of it. She wanted to go further, felt as though she could feel the softness of his tongue pushing against hers and he felt it in that exact spot.</p> <p>The room was still and then he pushed her head downward, holding her so her mouth came down on hers in a hard kiss that left her breathless. A soft whimper came from the kiss. Her hands roamed over his body, feeling his heart as it continued pounding as he continued kissing her.</p> <p>He pressed his lips against hers, hard. Her lips parted and she let him in, his tongue pushing into hers as his hands kneaded her body at the same time as one of his hands moved to the back of her neck and moved to the strap of her top. It came off, and then his hands moved to her bra, undoing it and then taking two snaps in the front and pulling it down and off.
