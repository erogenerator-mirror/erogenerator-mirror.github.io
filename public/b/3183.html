As the conversation grew more passionate, I noticed that there was a knock at the front desk telling us that someone was there with someone we could meet up at. I went to the door and when I opened it there was a tall, dark haired, blue eyed black man at the front desk. He smiled and extended his hand as I let him into my house. I said hello to him and he walked up the stairs to the second floor. I closed the door and turned and looked at him. He had a handsome face, great smile and brown eyes and dark hair that was spiked in places. He was wearing blue jean shorts and a brown v-neck shirt. I took his arm and slowly drew him to me. He took a step forward and began to take me in his arms and kiss me again as we embraced. It was a passionate kiss and I melted. He pulled away from me and with a questioning look, but didn't say anything. He went to the front of the shop and came back with a bag and showed it to me. I turned and took it from him. I got a big smile on my face. Then the black man walked back and turned and said something to me in a foreign accent. I turned my attention back to the black man behind me. They continued talking and laughing and I found myself lost in the depths of this deep sexual gaze. Suddenly, their eyes met and I could see something in them. Something about that dark eyes. I was taken aback by the sight of those eyes. The black man looked me over from head to toe at my body and then to the black man. The two of them went into the bedroom they had just come in from. I was left standing there. The black man went to the closet and returned with a black t-shirt and a pair of black skinny jeans. The black man helped me into the outfit while the black man finished dressing me in white tennis shoes and a white hoodie. He helped me put my hair up and zipped me up. He grabbed me by the hand and led me out of the house. The black man helped me out of his house and back into the street. We drove away from the police station and made our way back across the street and past the local police station building. My heart was racing and my pussy was wet and my clit was on fire. I was trying to hold it in check until the next day and had no idea of what I was getting myself into.</p> <p>We drove to the Black man's house. The black man opened the door and led me in. I walked in to find three people standing around talking with some of the people I had seen. I walked past one of them and took in the room. It was a nice house and looked very nice in the early morning. There was a table of two chairs sitting around a table that looked to be just inside the house. On the table was a plate of hot dogs, a few bags of chips and a coffee mug. The black man led me to a table next to the hot dogs. I looked around the table and saw a couple of men sitting at a table. They were talking to one another with the woman in a white tee shirt and the black man. The black man sat down at the table next to me but I didn't notice him sitting next to the woman. I looked down and noticed my shirt was unbuttoned and my nipples were poking out the top of my tee shirt. When I looked up at the black man and saw his hard cock pushing against the front of his jeans, I got that look in my eye which caused my pussy to start throbbing again. The black man took over and the two of them had me sit down.</p> <p>The black man cleared his throat and he looked at me and smiled as I looked up at him. We both looked at him through big eyes and knew what was coming. He motioned to one of the guys sitting there to come over and sat down. He brought the coffee mug to my lips and gently removed my lips with the tip of his tongue. When I opened my mouth to suck in a sip of my hot coffee, a light, warm tongue touched my lips. I tried to think about what was coming next and just sat there. I closed my lips around his tongue and sucked in a little. While his tongue danced around in my mouth, he gently pushed his way into my mouth and let his tongue touch mine which felt good. He began to kiss me with a passion I had never felt. At the same time our lips were together and my tongue was flicking out against his for all it was worth. The black man returned to my lips and slipped his tongue between them. The taste of my mouth was different than he expected and I really started to enjoy it. The two men were taking turns sucking my tongue but neither could quite feel the other's tongue and so they just kept kissing and sucking my tongueâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
