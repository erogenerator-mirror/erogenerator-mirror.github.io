"I'll tell you later. Right now, I need your help, my friend."</p> <p>And with that, the man vanished, disappearing through the doorway, into the hall.</p> <p>She was left alone with her thoughts, for she was almost positive the two men were gone.</p> <p>She sighed and sat back on her chair.</p> <p>She wondered how her day had gone so well. She had gotten to know her friends a bit better. The man had brought their meals and drinks, and she enjoyed talking to them. She did so well because she wasn't sure exactly who or why she was attracted to the man, or just to the fact that her friends could be so obviously dangerous.</p> <p>She shook her head as she picked up her glass and took a sip.</p> <p>He'd been her first lover in that very instant and now he was gone.</p> <p>She knew her face had turned red and she fought down a flash of pain. She should have known at that very moment that he was right. She should have put the fear of God into her voice, told him to move his lips.</p> <p>And she did so, though she did not make it obvious. She took another sip.</p> <p>But he hadn't.</p> <p>His hands weren't still, but he had removed them from her arms, and he had reached forward to clasp her face. He had been in danger of being torn from her, torn back to the side when they had kissed and felt and taken so close and safe.</p> <p>She shook her head, but didn't let out a sound. It was too late.</p> <p>"We're going out." She promised, and he released her quickly. She turned to the door, but he was gone.</p> <p>She heard a door open in the hallway. She heard his voice clearly.</p> <p>She shook once again.</p> <p>Shaking with fear and fear.</p> <p>"She doesn't know what she's in for." He told her.</p> <p>"I'm sure she gets it, as soon as I finish my glass."</p> <p>"But you're only 19." He whispered.</p> <p>"I'm not even 21." She said angrily.</p> <p>"I can't believe you!" He protested.</p> <p>"We can't leave you that way. Besides, you look like your first date, with a man that is."</p> <p>She sighed deeply and sat down again. This time, though, she let it go. The tension of having another man leave wasn't that bad.</p> <p>"All right, here it...I'm 21 now." She said, not looking up from her plate.</p> <p>"Yes," He said firmly. "But you can't leave. It will just hurt you even more, when you get older. Your friends will be your friends. And I'm sure they all love you in the meantime."</p> <p>She nodded, unable to take the heat in the room anymore. She was still in shock from seeing him just leave. She didn't want to leave him.</p> <p>"So, where do we go from here?" she asked, with a nervous look on her face. She looked up and saw he was dressed. He still had on his mask, as she had noted before. He had changed too, as his hands had moved up and he was holding his drink in two hands.</p> <p>Shaking her head, she tried to speak, but found something difficult to say.</p> <p>"I want you." He told her. "I love you."</p> <p>She nodded to herself, letting her eyes well up with tears.</p> <p>"Just...for now?" She asked, hopefully.</p> <p>"It'll pass. I will leave you alone once you're done. You'll get to see me before you leave. We can go out and get some dinner. How does that sound?"</p> <p>She nodded to herself. "Ok, so, where will we go from here?" she asked.</p> <p>The question shocked him, but he told it to her anyway.</p> <p>"We can go to a club." He told her.</p> <p>She shook her head. "I can't believe that you are asking me to run away. I haven't gotten that chance yet."</p> <p>She wasn't very convincing.</p> <p>"You may not like it that many times, but you have to say it. Tell me you love me. I want to see it." He told her, in his best boy voice. "Tell me you still love me." He said again, with more confidence this time.</p> <p>He saw her eyes light up in response, and sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
