"I... um, well... I..."</p> <p>"You have a very nice and tight pussy, Kate."</p> <p>"Thank you, and I am used to the attention, just not as well..."</p> <p>Jenny stopped herself. "Sorry. But I do like it that my husband likes it that way."</p> <p>"That's good." She blushed again and took another drink from her soda. "But I've only been with a woman ever once." I laughed.</p> <p>"You'll still get lucky."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Really." She took another deep breath with the same slow pace.</p> <p>"I'm not quite... I'm not sure what to say."</p> <p>Jenny laughed again. "Don't worry, we'll get past that."</p> <p>"But I do like being with other women and...and seeing them naked..." Jenny paused and thought. "No, I really don't think I'm ready for that... I'm not sure I'm ready for that?"</p> <p>Jenny pulled back so she could take another drink of her tea. "You're not a virgin."</p> <p>"No, I'm not." I shrugged my shoulders. "I've only kissed a couple of girls and never... and... well. What would it go for?"</p> <p>"I don't think I know."</p> <p>"Come on, Kate." I took another sip of my tea, and added one more drop of her tea. "You said you thought girls were different, so I guess they're different than a man is different from a woman."</p> <p>"Yeah, I just thought it was sexy. The way he touches me, they're so close!" Jenny took another drink as if to take in the whole conversation, but then stopped and began to laugh.</p> <p>"I think I'm a lesbian."</p> <p>"Do you want to know, Kate?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Well I want to know. Do you think I've really got a pretty face?" I laughed.</p> <p>She laughed out loud and shrugged her shoulders. "I think you're cute. When I saw you at that swim meet, I was shocked."</p> <p>"Really?" I asked. "What happened?"</p> <p>"Well, you were like six feet tall and you had these amazing breasts." She laughed again. "I mean, they're not really big really; kind of small. You were almost too skinny in that suit. But the way your skin was so smooth... you kept your legs apart just for balance." She took another drink from her glass and handed me hers. I took hers.</p> <p>"Kate, where did you get these?"</p> <p>"I bought some new lingerie when I was fifteen."</p> <p>"Wow." I raised my eyebrows. "What's a lingerie store like?"</p> <p>""It's the sexiest sex shops around."</p> <p>"I know. Some days I could do this all day." She blushed. "My panties are even more beautiful than they were in that suit."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>Jenny smiled. "Of course they are! And I bought a few pairs of lacey French panties for school and..."</p> <p>"Shopping?" I laughed. "Just lingerie? No way. I'd just wear it like this, if you didn't want to try it on..."</p> <p>"No, I didn't, but it's fun to find one of those on the net." Jenny's eyes got big. "I bought this little baby doll last night for your mommy after I had to go into town for her appointment."</p> <p>"Oh my gosh. So many things to do!" I looked around. "Just like that little thing that she used to wear... you know... in those tight... oh... oh... tight little things... all these tiny sexy little things." Jenny's voice was hushed. "Well, those things aren't anything to be ashamed of or ashamed of. And my friend in high school really got into the lingerie style. She wore lingerie so many times it didn't seem natural to wear lingerie. You know, I used to call her the Mommy's Panty-Head and stuff. When I met her, she was wearing a dress the same way as..." I looked around the shop. "It's really cool. She liked to wear it for me! She said if she got a chance to wear it to some of the party dances I would wear a skirt."</p> <p>"Hey, it's not my business, honey. I mean a lot of guys like to look at girls." Jenny had her hands in the pockets of her suit and was staring at me with big brown eyes.</p> <p>I laughed.
