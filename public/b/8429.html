Her hand slid down the front of my jeans to where it lay atop my erection. I couldn't help it.</p> <p>"I've always wanted to do this. Do you like it?" she stated.</p> <p>"Oh yeah, that would be great."</p> <p>Her fingers wrapped around my shaft and she began her ministrations.</p> <p>"Oh god. I need this," she moaned.</p> <p>She pulled up her dress and I felt my panties get soaked as she took them off. She lay back again and began to rub her wet pussy lips. I began to feel my own juices as my pussy started to ache to my lover's fingers. My breath coming to my throat. I was ready.</p> <p>"Do you want this?" she asked.</p> <p>"Oh god, oh fuck yes."</p> <p>She laid there and rubbed her puffy lips with her tongue as her body began to shake. I couldn't help myself. I lay myself down between her legs. I began to lick her pussy lips and the wetness they were covered in.</p> <p>"Oh...oh god....oh god," I moaned.</p> <p>"Take a second," she stated as she lay there.</p> <p>I got up and sat on the edge of the bed beside her. Slowly I moved my face lower until I was hovering in line to her pussy. I began to lick her from the top of her pussy to just under her navel. I felt her hand grasp the flesh between my fingers.</p> <p>"Oh shit," she groaned.</p> <p>I licked up and down her wet slit as my tongue moved over her clit. I looked at her as she sat there and watched me. I began to kiss my way from her pussy to her stomach and stomach button. Licking in circles around her navel. When I arrived at her clit she began to tremble. Her body began to convulse. The sound of her breathing quickening.</p> <p>When I felt her body begin to relax I placed the tip of my mouth on her clit and gently suckled it. I sucked hard until I felt her quiver.</p> <p>"Oh...oh my god," she gasped.</p> <p>I then reached up and began to play with all her body parts with my hands. She spread her legs open apart and grabbed my head between her legs.</p> <p>"You don't have to do anything," she said.</p> <p>I continued to tease her by kissing all over her pussy as she slowly grinded her hips.</p> <p>"Oh you feel nice," her voiced said.</p> <p>I began kissing all across her entire pussy with long strokes as my fingers massaged her clit.</p> <p>"Oh god, oh yes," she moaned.</p> <p>I then leaned back and looked up at her through a dazed eyes.</p> <p>"You are so beautiful," I whispered.</p> <p>She reached down and grabbed my erection and smiled as my tongue began to stroke its length.</p> <p>"You taste good," I said.</p> <p>"Your dick tastes great too," she stated.</p> <p>"I love your taste," I cooed.</p> <p>She smiled at me and looked at the clock.</p> <p>"We better hurry because I want to have an orgasm before we get married," she stated.</p> <p>"I understand, so you think it will be okay?" I asked.</p> <p>I looked up at her and nodded my approval.</p> <p>"I'm sure a lot will happen during our life. I know some people are going to say something about it."</p> <p>"I'm sure you will. It's up to you. I'll take care of things now," I stated.</p> <p>"Good, that means you will go on to something. I'll see you tonight," she stated.</p> <p>I rose from between her legs and got dressed quickly and walked down the hallway towards the front door. I could hear her breathing as she got dressed and when she opened the door I took my phone to send her a message.</p> <p>"I'd better be on my way. I'll see you tonight," she said.</p> <p>She closed the door, grabbed her dress and began to walk to her car with me right in the background. We began kissing again. She then stood in front of me, with her dress up.</p> <p>"You're going to make me wet," she stated.</p> <p>"I think you may already be wetâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
