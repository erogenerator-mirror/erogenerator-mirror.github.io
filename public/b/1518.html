I took out my cell phone and called the operator. Since he was right where I wanted to be, I hung up. The phone rang three times. I called the number and after twenty rings it was answered. I had to chuckle to myself that I had been so caught up in the moment that I lost track of the time.</p> <p>After a pause the number seemed to be going on another four minutes. I thought, "I hope he didn't think they would do me any damage." The phone went to voicemail. Then I heard a dial tone with a reply. I picked up the phone. It was one of those calls you always just go and ring the other operator, and you get the other woman to do the same thing. So if anyone were to ever try to call again, I had the number and I was happy to comply...and I got my ass out of there. After four rings I had the operator back in the bathroom and told him that I had to get back to the airport to collect my belongings and leave. He hung up the phone and said, "We have another hour or so. I'll pick you up in the morning." After hanging up the phone I grabbed my bag and I ran for the bathroom to change clothes. After changing I walked the three minutes to my gate. I could feel my skirt rubbing along the inside my thighs like a tent pole. I turned the corner of the gate and there he was...a man dressed like a young man in fatigues and a pair of combat boots.</p> <p>He said, "I'm Mike...that's my friend Mike."</p> <p>I said, "That's right...it's me." As I came up to him. He shook my hand lightly and then he grabbed a handful of my hair and yanked at it before letting go. We walked hand in hand. The guy was an average height about 6'4" and had brown hair, brown eyes, and brown eyes like most Marines from the Middle East. I could swear he looked like he was ten years older than him. I shook up his hand. He told me my name was Amy and that I was the last person he would ever want to be friends with.</p> <p>He walked me to my gate and he was holding my arm with one arm, and the other arm, both of us holding the side of our breasts together. I thought the little bit of a fight might seem funny right then but I took it anyway. After making sure that we walked inside my gate and that we were a few steps away from it I looked into Mike's eyes and I could see how scared I had still be for his safety. So for the last year I had been terrified to have a guy hold hands with me in some motel room and he didn't. Not even close.</p> <p>I said, "You're leaving your wife with me."</p> <p>He smiled and said, "If you are going to tell her that, well let's go."</p> <p>"I am not going to tell her," I said, "I'm leaving. I don't want her to worry."</p> <p>Then I saw a smile on his face that made my heart jump when his eyes suddenly went to my cleavage and my breasts. I reached under my shirt and grabbed my breasts and held them up. Mike put his hands on my arms and squeezed my breasts. He pinched and twisted at my nipples and when I tried to stop him, he just said, "Oh God, you are too hot."</p> <p>Once in the car I tried to pull the top down and get out of it but he said I must stay in it...he could take it all off if I wanted, he just wouldn't let me. Then it made me feel weird to see him holding my boobs. He took off his combat boots and jeans and started taking off my shirt. As he pulled off my bra, he gave my nipples a quick pinch. I couldn't wait to feel, feel, play with them. I didn't care that I would never get to play with them. The only two buttons that had to go were the middle ones for my jeans and also my underwear. The entire top half of my body was exposed. I couldn't help but be turned on. He took off my shoes, socks, and then my panties. I stepped out of them. I wanted to run at his strength and my own before I did it again.</p> <p>After he got off my pants he removed his underwear and tossed them on the floor. I stared as he took my shirt off. I took that off too and took off my bra. I felt his fingers caressing my naked breasts and his soft lips on the nipples. His cock was hard in his jeans. He looked down at me and said, "Look, you're so much more attractive that you are hidingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
