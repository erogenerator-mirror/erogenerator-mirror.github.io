A voice said.</p> <p>"Who?"</p> <p>"The girl at the office."</p> <p>Kirk looked down at her and smiled. "Well, I can't wait to tell you all about it."</p> <p>"Oh, and I have to be there too, I really want to meet her."</p> <p>"Well, then that'll be nice. I'll see you about 8...I hope you don't mind I borrowed your car so we'd better get going."</p> <p>"Thanks, Kirk. You won't regret it, I'm sure."</p> <p>"Me too, and hey, let's do grab some lunch while I'm away."</p> <p>They went shopping together; Kirk bought most of it and then headed over to the office. He'd had his first job in over two years and the first day back on a workweek was almost a whole different one compared to the one that Kirk had started before.</p> <p>"So, who are you meeting tonight? I'm sure you already knew..."</p> <p>"I do, and since we're going out, I'd prefer that you meet me first."</p> <p>"Oh, how can I refuse a chance like that?"</p> <p>"Nah, it's alright. It'll only take you about 20 minutes so we'll meet me at the main lobby."</p> <p>"Cool...and who'll be waiting for us?"</p> <p>"Well, it looks like your boss."</p> <p>"Oh that's right; he's a big hunk."</p> <p>"Gee, thanks for that. You're always looking at him the wrong way."</p> <p>"Well, there's usually only one thing I'd like to do in one place and then...uh...there isn't. He's just...so...you know."</p> <p>"I know, but you know I'm a guy...you'll understand when the right people figure out what I'm talking about."</p> <p>"Okay, thanks again, I guess."</p> <p>As Kirk walked away his mind wandered, he was now wondering where they'd go from here. His mind still reeling at the possibilities, he had no idea if he was to be going to the party tonight or he was going to have to go back to work...and then to go over to his house again. They'd never do that again...in fact, it would be their last one...but, he still couldn't shake the feeling. And he remembered the feeling of a small finger that touched him in the nicest way.</p> <p>They arrived at the party and Kirk noticed that she wasn't the only guy there, and he smiled because she could almost dance right through the music. She was dressed in a little black dress that was quite long and clung to every curve of skin one had ever seen on a woman; her legs were nicely shaped with a little extra to go with it. Kirk noticed a very pretty little blonde who kept asking who this girl was if one of her friends happened to be his wife.</p> <p>"So, if you don't mind, do you think I'll have a seat near the front of your table with the rest of you?"</p> <p>Biting his lip, Kirk just nodded his head. Of all the things they could do, the chair next to Kirk would be the easiest. He sat across from the beautiful blonde with her eyes closed. "So, the first thing we have to do is find out who these girls really are."</p> <p>They'd never been to their table, but the place looked like it was a small, private little place. There was no table in the center of the room, but the walls seemed to open to a narrow room that looked like an actual sauna at one side; a large wooden desk and two leather comfortable chairs sat in front of the room at the back of the room. And when Kirk turned around his view was very limited, because his back was to one wall but there was a small window looking out over the room. And when he turned around to look out over the room, he saw that they had another room that faced the front of the building and was slightly off to one side of the room. And when he glanced in, he saw that everyone could just barely get a glimpse of each person entering through the little window into the space.</p> <p>He watched as both women started chatting, so he walked over to stand in front of them. "So, this is where you guys come from...when I went over to the guy's place I came to find out that this was the only way they'd ever get along. So, you're going to need some good drinks."</p> <p>He was almost sure that she was joking. "Thank you."</p> <p>"Well, I'm actually doing some research on the new job at the officeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
