As always, be sure to get your mind out of your head," he says.</p> <p>"That's right," I say, still thinking of the other two women I've seen.</p> <p>"We'll have to do this again to see if that works," he says and smiles before going on.</p> <p>"But I think you just might," I say, and look at him. "What about the third time, do you need to know if I can do it again?"</p> <p>"Well, just try. If it doesn't work, you don't have to do it. I'll just have to come up with you a different type of time," he says.</p> <p>"And I wouldn't let you just pick a time," I say.</p> <p>He shrugs his shoulders and goes on. He says, "Let's make this quick." He takes a piece of paper out of my hand. He takes my hand, and puts my left fist in his. He puts my right fist in his. We start moving our arms and he goes back to work.</p> <p>"I'll be working at the desk," I say.</p> <p>"Yeah, right. Get to those pens. I don't even need to work there," he says, and smiles when he sees me start looking at pens.</p> <p>I read his words. They seem to make sense now. "Yeah, I'm going to need to have these pens, especially if I'm going to be working for you as many times a day," I say.</p> <p>He leans back and looks at me. "That's okay, I'm sure we can work it out."</p> <p>I take a pen and put it in my mouth. He takes a pen and puts it in his mouth. I look at the pen, and see a line of ink on it.</p> <p>"Hmmm. That should look good," I say.</p> <p>"I'm done with you, but it will still be fun having you in this office all day," he says.</p> <p>I pick up two pens, and get to work.</p> <p>It's not long before I'm done with the two pens. I'm sure that I'll be able to do this again soon, but I've already lost a bit of enthusiasm. So I keep working until he calls me to say that I can see what I need to know.</p> <p>"How can I be certain that you'll be able to see anything if you're not working in there?" he asks.</p> <p>"I've got to be sure of it if I can get myself to actually have some clothes on," I say.</p> <p>"So you need to wear your clothes?" he asks.</p> <p>"Yep, but if that's the thing that you want to do," and he starts putting things in my bag, "then I guess I need to do that for you," he says and looks a little frustrated.</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess I have to be sure that my clothes can be removed and put away, that's the trouble," I say.</p> <p>"You're right, but if that's what you want to do," he says, "don't try it. The only thing that's going to happen is that you'll have to come up with me a new type of time."</p> <p>I smile to myself, "You're right, but it just doesn't seem fair for me to do that to our marriage."</p> <p>"Yeah, well, that's the idea and what not," he says, giving me a smirk. "I think I can work it out, and we can just keep this a private session."</p> <p>To be continuedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
