"You came like a wild horse."</p> <p>The orgasm had been long, and he was still hard, so he asked, "Are you close to cumming again?"</p> <p>"I'm not quite ready yet." I responded, as I slid up over him, taking him inside me again.</p> <p>"That was nice so far, baby, but I want to go and find you." I told him, and as I climbed off the bed, he pulled the covers over us both, and I slipped on my robe, which only left a few loose strands of hair to cover my breasts.</p> <p>On his way to the bathroom, Michael got me a clean bathrobe, which I laid out on the bed. He also returned a bit later to the room, as he slipped into his robe. I felt something cold and wet on my breast – I hadn't noticed before, but now I was aware. Before he could speak, I slipped into the robe and closed the belt. It was only seconds later that my hand slipped down to cover him. He was still dressed, but had stopped pulling on his robe and was in the process of lifting it off his shoulders, when a warm, wet sensation was running down from between his legs. I could imagine a large, stiff rod, sliding under that robe, and slowly disappearing into my body the next time we were alone.</p> <p>He slipped out of the room, as I tried to think or explain to him what had happened. He came back in a second or two, but he was still wearing his clothes. I slipped off my robe, and with a mischievous grin, turned toward him just as he was turning away from me.</p> <p>"You know," I said coyly, "I had to do that with him because he's so nice. I really like him."</p> <p>Michael's response surprised me. He took both of my hands and pulled me down to the bed. We both pulled the covers down and both fell to the middle of it. Our nipples were hard, as we both had no idea what was going on. My hands were exploring the area between his legs. As I leaned in to kiss his chest, one of his hands dropped to my knee. I started to lift my skirt, and he slid his finger along the inside of the warm flesh, and along the moist lips of my pussy.</p> <p>I rolled to the side so he could kiss me, which he did. His tongue slid in between my lips. He slid his finger back and found my hard bud, sliding it in and out. Our tongues caressed each other; he pulled the bottom of my shirt up and then pushed his tongue in deep. While my own tongue was doing what it did best, mine was doing the same to his. We were both lost in the moment as I slowly slid down his body. His hand dropped to one of my knees and slid the one covering mine aside. As the backs of my thighs touched them, I moaned. I felt his fingers on mine, and I was afraid to move. Then his tongue started sliding down my stomach, only to pause as he reached the top of my thighs just touching the thin fabric of my panties. Then he slide his fingertip forward, and I didn't resist for anything.</p> <p>"Oh, Michael. I...Oh" I stammered, as he slid his finger under the fabric, then up my slit.</p> <p>"It's okay. He's good," he told me. "Just keep kissing me and enjoy yourself," he said as he slid his finger up again.</p> <p>I couldn't think straight, but I did. My thighs opened wide, as if in invitation. My lips opened in anticipation of those fingers, as his tongue and fingers moved into new territory. I felt the moisture that had coated them, as his tongue slipped out and started working it all around my pussy entrance. I could feel the heat, and the excitement of my body. The hand on my shoulder slid down to my breast, where he stroked my nipple while the other hand cupped my breast. My hand pulled his finger in and out, and I moaned his name.</p> <p>When he started rubbing the bottom of my lips with his fingertip, I felt the heat. The wetness there was even warmer. I tried to relax the muscles around me, as I closed my eyes. A finger from my other hand slid slowly between my lips, and slipped quickly inside me. I moaned as his finger filled me up. He stopped there, as he slipped it back out, just as I had the first time!</p> <p>As his finger slid slowly in and out, I heard myself moan each time. His finger tip caressed just against my clitoris for a fraction of an inch, only enough to—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
