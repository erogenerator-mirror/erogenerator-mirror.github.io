She was so sexy I didn't want to move. She moved up one more time and I reached out again for her. I was so close I could feel her breathing. I started to pull her up but she stopped me. She just smiled as she got her legs off of mine and moved back down to sit beside me...we kissed. My hands explored her upper body.</p> <p>She lay there for a second and opened her arms and legs a little bit more. I couldn't look at her and just lay there in her arms. She moved her arms around my shoulders and I could feel her soft warmth. I turned on to my side with one arm round her, and held her while my other hand played softly on her leg. I kissed her lips again and then again in the same gentle way. I couldn't think of a word that I liked better. As I kissed the tip of her ear where it pointed and her neck I saw her smiling.</p> <p>"This is what it's like," she laughed.</p> <p>I rolled over and lifted her a little.</p> <p>"What, are you ready to carry on playing with me?"</p> <p>"I wanted to."</p> <p>"You didn't," she said and I could tell her smile was not to be denied.</p> <p>"If you want me, play with me."</p> <p>"Are you sure you don't want a little more foreplay?"</p> <p>She smiled again and kissed me. "I've been with a woman before. Most are sore and a bit on the rough side. It depends on the man. I don't usually like sex with just one person but I always have a lot more sex...if I can have sex with all three at once."</p> <p>I got her close and kissed her again and began to massage her breasts again. I ran my finger along the nipple and she giggled and took it between her thumb and index finger, and began to roll it. I got a little bit more of it between my thumb and finger and she made a little squeal. I was getting good at bringing her to ecstasy and she began to writhe her hips slowly.</p> <p>"I can come back," she said and it sounded almost like an apology.</p> <p>I had no intention of it. I wanted to enjoy what it was like. Her breasts felt so full and so soft and I could imagine them lying in my hands for me long days in the sunlight. I was really hoping that she would want the same.</p> <p>"You aren't too sore," I said and she turned towards me very seductively.</p> <p>I didn't have to think too much. "Yes," I agreed with her in a tone that was just a little naughty.</p> <p>She lay down on top of me and we started to make out again. I could feel her soft breasts on my bare chest and I loved the feel of her large areoles poking at my skin. I felt her hard nipples rubbing against me and I was glad she had a nice body. As we kissed, my hand moved down her belly to stroke one of her buttocks and she moaned in delight. I kissed her ear and ran my tongue and lips along the back of her ear and then back to her ear.</p> <p>I could feel her heart beating in her throat as she lay on top of me, her breasts pressed into my chest. I caressed her behind through the flimsy material of the negligee. Her legs were spread wide for me and her sex was just inches away from me.</p> <p>I kissed the outside of one of her legs so I could get a good look at it. I kissed the back of her knee then and ran my tongue along the top of it. She moaned a little more and moved her body from side to side. I moved the leg I had been playing with to the side so I could get better access to her sex. Her sex was just a bit hairy so I ran my tongue up and down her slit in a way that I hoped she liked.</p> <p>She moved her legs wider and started to move her hips to meet me. I was about to move back a little when I remembered why I couldn't really do any of this with my husband. I wanted to kiss everything in between...my hands were going crazy exploring her body. I felt her tremble slightly as my tongue began to lick the inside of her thighs.</p> <p>"Oh John," she moaned as I slid down the bed a little bit more.</p> <p>"Oh, I've never done this...but like, in my dreams it's all I can do."</p> <p>"What dreams?" she laughed and moved her hips so I could continue without a lot of pressure.</p> <p>"To be with you, that's like fucking."</p> <p>"That's soâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
