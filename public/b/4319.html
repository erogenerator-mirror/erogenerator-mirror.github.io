My body began to heave while my hands began to tremble. My heart pounded a mile-a-minute, my ears strained to hear my cries. I couldn't hold back any longer. My body shuddered as it shook through my orgasm; I came so hard my skin felt raw, yet my mind was screaming at me for release.</p> <p>When I regained control over my body, I grabbed the vibrator, flipped it on, and rubbed it through my pussy.</p> <p>"Oh...my...God!" I repeated over and over.</p> <p>The vibrations were driving me insane! I knew I had to use it.</p> <p>But I needed a moment to recover, for what I thought was too much had changed in me. I opened my eyes and gazed up at him. My eyes were heavy with lust and lust, as were my heart beat. He watched as I slid the vibrator up and over my clit and slowly began to slide it back and forth. It was driving me insane and I knew it wouldn't take long for me to climax.</p> <p>I was panting and trembling as I slipped the vibrator between my legs, rubbing against my opening while I continued to play with my pussy.</p> <p>He knelt up and held the vibrator against my vagina. I closed my eyes and let out the first of several breaths while I played with my pussy; I wanted to savor every second, every inch of his strong body.</p> <p>I felt his hand rest on my stomach, his fingers lightly stroking my body as his hand slid up my body to rest against my neck, my lips, my tits.</p> <p>He brought me in for a kiss, long and deep that I could feel the vibrations all throughout my body. He pulled my hips to him with his fingers to meet it, holding me tightly in his arms while the vibrations vibrated my body! He held me just for a minute, I could feel each beat of his heart inside me. He brought me back by pulling my hips to him, his cock against my thigh, and our mouths met in a heated passion of need. I felt our tongues touch and the vibrations of the vibrator sent goosebumps throughout my body.</p> <p>He broke our kiss, leaned back to remove his finger from my body and then traced my nipple with it. My nipples were like little erasures, his touch sent the electricity up along my body. He continued playing with my nipples, and then he took it between his thumb and forefinger to gently massage and squeeze them between his fingers while he continued his tongue exploring my mouth. His fingers moved and explored with featherlight touches to my lips, my chin, the neck, my breasts, and everywhere between, but in my pussy.</p> <p>He kept moving my lips with his mouth, sucking, and nibbling at them. He pushed my tongue into his mouth to feel it as much as I did. That had to be one of the most erotic feeling a girl can have in her younger years. He sucked my tongue into his mouth and I tried to hold his hard cock in my hand, but I could not. I had found pleasure in my brother and that was enough for me.</p> <p>It was the first moment I had ever experienced a female lover other than his, his hands and fingers had never touched me so intimately, his tongue licking and probing for my body. His hands were as loving as his mouth and fingers could be, exploring my body with every inch of their exploring, exploring. I moaned as it became apparent that it was time for me to get him off, to take him inside, to taste his hard cock, and to see how it felt in my hands.</p> <p>He removed his fingers from my lips and I whimpered with need. Then he moved to my tits again, gently kneaded and squeezed them with his hand. His hands moved upward and finally found my nipples. He tweaked and rubbed them in between his fingers, while his fingers continued to stroke and squeeze my body.</p> <p>The first touch sent an electrifying sensation rocketing throughout my entire body, my toes curled, and a small shudder went through my chest. My hands moved to the back of his head and my fingers tugged it in between his mouth and ear. We held our mouths locked together, mouths opening and closing rhythmically. Our tongues explored each other's mouths while he played with my body. In between his kisses, I could feel his teeth sink into my flesh, causing goosebumps to rise on my skin.</p> <p>His hands moved back to my tits and he used them to massage them both at once. My nipples were extremely sensitive and he was giving them the attention I needed to give my whole body. I could hear the sounds of his fingers inside me, and then my body tensed and a wave of pleasure swept through my bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
