Why don't you go see the doctor now? How is his cock doing?"</p> <p>"It looks different."</p> <p>"It has a much better head to me."</p> <p>"I'm going see him for coffee."</p> <p>"Let me call you while I'm away." he smiled.</p> <p>"I'd better." and I finished my shower.</p> <p>I ran down the stairs and yelled for the first and only girl I had seen on the phone to come in. She came in and kissed me on the side of my mouth.</p> <p>"That was nice." and she dropped the phone down on the counter.</p> <p>"Thank you, my name is Sarah and I have a new boyfriend. We've just been here for a couple of months now. I will call her and let her know."</p> <p>"I can't believe how you have already told him already that you love him. That you have already slept with his dad."</p> <p>"That's no problem. I feel guilty about what we did."</p> <p>"Is that his dad you're talking about? Not some jerk?"</p> <p>"He was my first boyfriend and my first lover. I didn't want to leave before we had a chance to make a proper commitment."</p> <p>"I suppose you've had your fun, and I am ready to get back to work."</p> <p>"Don't talk like that, I like talking about my experiences. Tell me what you think."</p> <p>"Your first girlfriend is actually better than I imagined."</p> <p>"You are so right. I wish you could take me back home without me hating you."</p> <p>"It's fine. I don't hate you, I just like to experience more of you. There is something about you that gives me the feeling of control, confidence is just right."</p> <p>"Your confidence is my confidence?"</p> <p>"Yes, and there's nothing that I wouldn't do to make you happy. Just remember what happens with me when you're in love with someone."</p> <p>"I already have my doubts about that. I just feel like I'm floating in a bubble somewhere on the surface of the ocean."</p> <p>"It makes me feel good to know that."</p> <p>Before she could answer, the doorbell rang. I went inside with Sarah, and took off my clothes. When my clothes were off, I was again standing on the balcony looking out over the ocean. The sun was still shining in the bay at high noon. Sarah told me to come out to the patio as she walked quickly toward the door.</p> <p>I got down and walked up to the patio. The man from the kitchen was standing there with a coffee cup in his hand toasting a new cup. I could hear him drinking from it.</p> <p>"You didn't expect to catch them did you?"</p> <p>"You're so beautiful."</p> <p>I put my arms around Sarah as we stood there talking. When we finished our cup, we got up and walked back to the patio. I told her about the new boyfriend. She told me that she had to work late tonight because they had a meeting in an hour.</p> <p>"That sounds great. I can't wait until it's your next visit alone and let's go to the bedroom for our first time."</p> <p>"How about tonight?"</p> <p>"If my next time will bring me something to eat, we can take lunch somewhere."</p> <p>"I'm ready, let's go." she said.</p> <p>When we got back into the bedroom, we had made love on the bed, lying next to each other on the bed sheets. I had had the most wonderful night with Sarah, and I hoped that she would do the same for me, and that we could be as close as we want to be. I had made the most beautiful bed for us to love together that night.</p> <p>Chapter Four</p> <p>"I'm glad that you didn't bring flowers." she said. "I hate them, and I am so glad that we are going to live together. Now we know how to make our first year even better. You are such an understanding lover."</p> <p>"Honey, I would never take anything for granted."</p> <p>"I know. This is our first year together and I am so pleased with myself that I am going to be the first to tell you how great it is."</p> <p>"Thank you. I feel a lot better at that point."</p> <p>"You areâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
