Our kisses were slow and gentle, but the heat in the room was so raw!</p> <p>"Mornin!" I murmured against her cheek.</p> <p>"Huh?" She said, her hand moving behind my head to press me tighter against her.</p> <p>"I wanna kiss you," I said, as a slow trickle of my own arousal escaped from within herself. I kissed her hard, my tongue tangling and pressing in with her own. "I know," I murmured, my lips leaving hers with a flick of my tongue.</p> <p>My heart pounded as Kelis' tongue made its way over mine. I could feel my cock jerk and harden as our kiss heated us both. My hands stroked her back, down under her tank top, and then back up to her bare chest. Kelis' hands were in my hair, pulling, her own fingers combing through my hair as she brought mine back to her. It was more than I could say for us, the kiss was more complete.</p> <p>"You," I murmured against her lips, "are so damn hot for me," I said, my voice tumbling with lust and desire. "We shouldn't be doing this," I whispered, breaking the kiss and looking at her. "But how can two people that don't know each other be doing this if they want to be together?"</p> <p>Keri was startled, as any number of emotions I thought she may have been feeling earlier were suddenly there in her body language. Before her, she had said, "Not unless you want me too!" But then, the look in her eyes said the same thing I had heard in her words when I whispered, "I wish we could be together,"</p> <p>"I want it too," she murmured, "but we can't do anything about it."</p> <p>Keri grabbed a blanket from an unoccupied desk in the bedroom, the covers pulled over the edge of the bed. I stripped off my shirt again, but now we both climbed into the bed naked and we embraced again, my arms and legs wrapping her in my embrace. I kissed her throat and shoulder, nuzzling her soft skin and then moving to her neck, kissing down to her collar bones where her small but firm breasts lay soft and proud. My lips followed her chest up, kissing her skin as I went.</p> <p>Keri drew the blanket over her, then lay back on the bed, pulling me to her. We kissed again, our tongues dancing in each other's mouths, our hands exploring with desire. Kelis' legs crossed behind my back, her arms wrapped around me. As I kissed her, Kelis pulled her knees up to her chest and opened herself to me. As kisses resumed, my hands roamed over her breasts and her body. I rolled her nipples between my thumb and forefinger, and my fingers were soon moving along her cleavage to her breasts.</p> <p>As our kisses slowly broke off, Kelis lifted her shirt over her head, throwing it on the bed. Her bra was a lacy, see-through yellow lace set which, if she had tried it on, would have obscured her nipples. My hands reached back to unhook the bra, then I moved to join Kelis on the bed.</p> <p>Keri drew my face from her breasts to look me in the eye as I slipped the bra off, tossing it on the pile on the chair. "You shouldn't kiss me," she said, her voice trembling with desire. Before Kelis could answer, Kelis reached over and put her fingers to my lips, urging me to pull myself even closer to her.</p> <p>I slid my right hand down Kelis' body, feeling the skin of her flat belly as I went. I traced the outline of her mound with my fingers, following her skin, down to where my fingertips touched the top of her lips. Kelis squirmed, almost pulling me in with her body.</p> <p>My hand stroked one of her breasts, feeling the hardness of her nipple, the texture of it, the firmness and the texture. It made her squirm and moan and her nipples puckered and hardened against my fingers. After a moment, Kelis's eyes closed as she arched her back, her body arching upwards to meet my hand. Her moans were becoming more intense and her breath coming in short gasps. I let my fingers toy in her body, gently caressing her skin.</p> <p>"Ah," she sighed, "You have such hands," she whispered, "That feels so nice." She shuddered slightly. "Suck," she said softly.</p> <p>I slid my hand down from her breast, finding her already wet and eager pussy. It was smooth and wet, and as I rubbed her, it came alive in her. I pushed the tips of two fingers intoâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
