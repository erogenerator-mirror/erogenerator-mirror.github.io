With some trepidation, I crept out and stood by the window to stare upon the city lights. Just then, the sound of a car coming brought me back to earth. I opened the curtains and peered through the glass into the night before closing and locking the door. I took a quick look around, and realized I could have walked around the house unnoticed because there was no one around all night. If a house was locked, I could have left, but my fear of being caught at this time was too great. I was in an unfamiliar neighborhood and the moon was still out and the shadows fell to the street. I closed up the bedroom window and quickly made my way downstairs and across to the back of the house. I crept up to the door and pulled it open, the light from the street coming through the windows reflecting off the night.</p> <p>As I approached the front steps, I was greeted by a young man wearing only a towel and wearing very tiny shorts. His long dark hair hung down his back. As he reached the steps, he turned his head toward me. I quickly looked away and walked toward him. Suddenly, I knew my luck was in my hands. With one of his feet planted on the first step, he reached up and pulled his towel away from his body. He was completely naked! I had seen many men, even in magazines and I was in no condition to notice them. His penis was long and thick. I looked back toward the front driveway as he pulled the fabric around himself.</p> <p>I could see a large amount of his pubic hair. His penis and balls were tightly confined in his towel. He was very muscular from all his exercise, and it appeared he was in pretty bad shape because his legs and feet were askew. His large nipples and areolas were erect from the exposure to the cool night. I could feel a wetness beginning to flow down my body. I wanted to reach over and touch myself right there, but decided that I should leave it alone.</p> <p>We had only just started talking so I told him about my plan for breaking in as many people as possible. I went on to tell him about the first time I got lucky enough to sneak onto the back steps naked and watch the night get in the window. My initial shock had passed quickly as the excitement of having the young man naked in my house filled me with excitement. I knew this was wrong, but the taboo of it turned me on much more than I had expected. As I sat down on the front step and started to climb down, I realized that my own penis was already beginning to erect. I watched helplessly as his eyes opened to the full moonlight shining in through the windows. I looked back at the path toward my house as I continued to unbutton my shorts. His eyes were on me as I slowly slid the zipper down. I sat naked across from him in the moonlight, my small penis now pointing straight up toward him. I felt so sexy standing naked by the window, just as I had been doing many times over the years.</p> <p>As I stood there letting him look over at me, my own penis continued to get even harder. With an excited look on my face, I reached out with my hands and grabbed his penis. He had it by the base, so my thumb and forefinger were easily able to spread the pre-cum at the tip of his penis. His eyes went wide as a thought struck me. He hadn't done anything to arouse himself with a naked man, but, then again, we had never gone any further than that. Still, it was something we did often.</p> <p>His eyes returned my gaze, and the look of arousal in his eyes. He asked, "Is there something you'd like to do?"</p> <p>This was not my intention at all as I quickly turned and hurried out to the back yard. I had no idea which way I wanted to go, but was determined to go at all costs. I quickly reached over to the railing and pulled myself up and through the house. Even though the night's light was out and only the night sky illuminated me as I approached the steps. He quickly followed me down the steps without looking ahead. We began to walk at a slowly pace toward my house. We were only about 2 blocks away from my house when I again looked up at the street. As I stood there, watching the moon shining down on us, my hands instinctively reached inside of my pants and began to rub my naked upper thigh softly. I tried to keep my face neutral and just stare down as his hands traveled up my inner thigh towards my cock. He stroked my erection and ran his hand all over my erection. My cock and balls began to move from side to side, as his hand rubbed and massaged them. My breathing was coming in rapid little pants. We could both feel our heart pounding in time to our strokesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
