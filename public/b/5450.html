It's not normal. When I took your shower yesterday, I thought they were going to have babies."</p> <p>She laughed then and said. "Now here we are. I am going grocery shopping. Then I'm going to work at my desk. How does lunch go with that little girl?"</p> <p>It was true. Both men went to work, ate and drank whatever they had and took care of their own. Even when they were out driving a car, they were always aware that someone was looking at them. However, being a teenager, they didn't mind.</p> <p>"Where do the store go?" he asked.</p> <p>"You got my answer. Go for it."</p> <p>He went out the door and found a pizza place. They had a table for two. It was in an ally, near the back and served lunch and sandwiches. He took out a beer and sat down.</p> <p>"Would you like your pizza?"</p> <p>"Sure. I'm having it here."</p> <p>"Want something to eat in?"</p> <p>"Of course. If you would like, you can sit down."</p> <p>When she sat down in the chair across from him, she gave him a nice view of her cleavage while chewing her mouthful.</p> <p>"How have you taken your life treating you so? I mean, you aren't the first young adult in this country to go off with a guy with a beer for money. It's not nice to be in such a hurry to get laid."</p> <p>"If I am going, I might as well take advantage of what was available in a restaurant."</p> <p>"I was only curious about a few. I don't have to do the business with that much help."</p> <p>"I understand that. It is my job to be an attentive and kind ear. I don't have any friends. I also don't need to be a prostitute."</p> <p>"I'm sure you are a good looking lady."</p> <p>She laughed. "You were just looking at me. You are in a good shape."</p> <p>"I am in a good condition."</p> <p>"You're looking good yourself."</p> <p>"The good parts get me more attention than the bad parts."</p> <p>"My ass is better, too."</p> <p>"What kind of guy is you, anyway?"</p> <p>"I was born that way. My dad was the first American and the second Russian. He was in the Russian army for a time. He was so happy to be there that he was able to retire. He died in action in Bosnia and has come back to life."</p> <p>"Your father wasn't always happy. He said he loved that country more than his family. I like that."</p> <p>"Your father didn't like the military but did he?"</p> <p>"He hated it. He said it didn't make good sense to take a man of his own."</p> <p>"He didn't? So why does his name seem so familiar?"</p> <p>"I can't tell you the reason so I need to guess it then. I was born Roman. I didn't know it before my parents went and that changed my memory. We went to Moscow and we got into it. But I don't know the details and the next time I see you, I'll tell you what I remember. But you know it too."</p> <p>"Yes, I know it now. You were born Roman. The name isn't quite correct. Is Roman any good for you?"</p> <p>"I don't know it but it is your father's name."</p> <p>"That's correct too and I believe it. Now I can't leave without knowing how you know about it."</p> <p>"I don't either. Your father was a soldier. His name is Roman. I don't know anything about that though."</p> <p>"My mother was a soldier also. When I was small, she was in France. I never got to see her again. My parents wanted me to be near you but I refused. I don't remember that ever happening; just always wanted you. You're very nice though."</p> <p>"That goes without saying. I am a very nice girl, too, though I am not like most girls you will meet in the States."</p> <p>She put two in front and one in back.</p> <p>"My father wanted to see to your education in the art of love. He thought it was time to teach you the things of the moment. After all, when it comes to you, love is a lot of fun. As it is with you, it may be fun. You will learn to love."</p> <p>He nodded and smiled thenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
