I already told my girlfriend that the sex of her life is none of your business."</p> <p>"I really didn't mean to make you worry, Sam" I explained to her, "But it's getting late and I'm gonna bed my wife. Just say the word and we can go on, you know, to do a threesome."</p> <p>"Why not?" she asked, "I'm always horny, ya know, like that. I've had plenty of blowjobs in my teens, have got a huge dick, so fuck off. You do like to go down on and you can do it to me anytime, can't you?"</p> <p>"I know we were talking to each other, Sam – I really mean that in my defence – and I know I'm not trying to make this all about sex here. I'm just saying that if your girlfriend were to ask what my dick is like and we had a threesome, will you be up for it?"</p> <p>Without saying a word, I pulled her up, kissed her deeply, fondled her tits with both hands, lifted her skirt, and plunged my tongue inside her mouth. She kissed me back and we just lay together for a while, kissing and caressing, before she turned over and spread her legs. "Come on, Sam – come and help me get me into position".</p> <p>She lay back and I moved my head, first over her stomach, then under it and between her legs for a while, making sure that she was wet and ready for more. I lifted her legs up and put them over my shoulders. She guided me, as I slid my dick into her. Her legs squeezed around my temples as I pushed my dick in and out of her, gradually increasing the speed and intensity of the feeling. I kissed her neck and fondled her tits as I went on. She raised her hips with each stroke and I felt a little shudder run down my back as I moved my hands to her bum and pulled her backwards, then turned her round so I could have access to her pussy from underneath. We got into a smooth, rhythmic motion over and over, she had long legs over my shoulders and was encouraging me to go deeper with each stroke.</p> <p>We moved together, our sweat dripping off of our bodies as we fucked each other like the wanton pair we were. She had her head bent and her hands were on her head, her arms around me, and I was supporting her as she arched her back slightly to push herself back at me. We were fucking each other harder and harder and we really did it without mercy. All I could feel is the sweat as it slid up and down her body on each stroke. She came for me for a long, long time. It was almost as if she knew what it would cause me to orgasm and she knew it too. Eventually, we both slowed down, and I reached down and took her ankles off the end.</p> <p>"Sam - I really could get to like that! I am really sorry but I cannot believe I said that to you in the first place!"</p> <p>"Oh Sam, come again!" she pleaded, "I've been so horny – it's difficult to be with someone without trying to be in control – and I'm not aching to cum again. I just need some time to think about it".</p> <p>"Well, then I will just stay here with you, will you feel comfortable about that?" I suggested, "Or do you need to tell your boyfriend to put a condom on me again?"</p> <p>"He will if he'll have a chance; Sam, I really want that to happen – but at the same time I don't know if I am ready for that again!" she complained and then sighed.</p> <p>"Hang on Sam; maybe I should have used a condom, I don't even know exactly what diseases your body has, but you are an attractive young woman and any man can fall in love with you, if for no other reason than sex!" I pleaded with her, "And it seems to me that you are still going to like me because I don't have to be with anyone!"</p> <p>I thought it strange that she seemed to be able to understand my words, but thought at the same time that I would find no difference between what I just said and what she had just said. "No, Sam, the truth is that you look as good as you should be. But you need to find someone a little younger and a bit more adventurous. I certainly have not done that – yet – and I'm sorry and I don't even think you are old enough! If we hadn't just had an affair, if we had waited for our marriage to be over like this, I would have been happy to try. But you have got yourself into something very much, Sam, you—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
