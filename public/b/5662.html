She sat in the chair nearest to the window and I took the opportunity to put my hands on my lap to keep the fabric of my skirt from sticking up so much.</p> <p>She stood up and stood directly in front of me. I looked down at her cleavage in her lace bra and skirt. The skirt ended just above the knee and made me wonder how high it would be if it had stayed that far. She looked at my chest and smiled. She put her arms out behind her to support herself and then leaned forward so she could take my drink before sitting.</p> <p>I didn't want to wait that long. I really didn't want to wait much longer. As I drank the liquor she started to undress me. The skirt was a black silk with a zipper down the back and the straps were open all the way up, one at a time. Next came my panties and my t-shirt, then my bra. I don't know why, but at this point I was really nervous. Here was a woman who was completely turned on and I was just standing in front of her completely naked.</p> <p>When all of our attention was focused on what she was about to do I think she decided that she needed to take it off. I watched her hands unclasp her bra and it fell forward. She moved the straps off her shoulders and dropped it to the ground, revealing a pink bra with tiny white lace trim. I was a little disappointed by my decision to take off the panties, but that might take another ten seconds. I just wanted to watch what she was doing, so I slowly unzipped my skirt and let it fall to the floor.</p> <p>My tits bobbled slightly as she stood and stepped out of it. I felt awkward looking at a strange-looking woman with her skirt and panties on, and that brought a new level of discomfort to me. Then the whole bra was gone and all of my breasts had come bare! At first I felt kind of weird staring at her, but I was starting to get aroused at the same time.</p> <p>She sat down again to remove her bra, again with her arms out in front of her. I watched her fingers unzip her panties and slide them down her leg and then off. Finally, she took on a half-smile in the mirror and she stood up and stepped over to me. I felt the soft skin of her ass and the smooth fabric of her panties against my face. She turned slowly around and dropped to herself, leaning on the glass as she did. She leaned into me for a minute or so, almost lying on top of me but just a little, letting me feel her weight. I could feel her breasts under the lace of the bra and the fabric of her bra in the crack of her ass, but the feeling was incredible for me.</p> <p>Finally, I could have kissed her long and hard, and I did. I don't know what I'd felt and what I didn't, and right now, it didn't matter. All that was important was that it got better. And the feeling was incredible, and we were a perfectly happy couple. Then she pulled back and looked me in the eyes.</p> <p>"So...I'm the luckiest guy here tonight" she said, holding my gaze.</p> <p>"Really?" I asked.</p> <p>She gave me a funny look and then, with a little nervous sounding laugh, she said, "Really" and then winked at me. We kissed once more and then she dropped her head down. This time, she reached between her legs, pushing them back slightly, exposing her sex and opening her lips to the light. I reached down and touched her in a way to say 'go ahead', but my mind was running in different directions.</p> <p>I had taken off my blouse when we were together, but not before she had taken off her skirt. Now it was just a skirt and panties, so I stepped back a little and took my skirt off. As I began to unbutton it, she stopped me and I pulled my skirt down as I reached around.</p> <p>I slipped the skirt over my head and it fell to the floor. She just sat there still looking at me in the reflection in the mirror and then let her arms drop to her sides. She reached down and pulled the bra to the side and it fell away. Her breasts stood straight out and I got a glimpse of them for the first time. She looked like a beautiful woman, all pink and soft and hairless. Her nipples were small and straight pointing straight out, but they stood out hard, begging to be kissed.</p> <p>And then I reached up and cupped her breasts in my hands. They felt even better in my hands than on my back, but the sensation was different because it wasn't hard to stimulate her breasts.
