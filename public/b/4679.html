"I'm kind of wet from our kissing."</p> <p>She leaned forward to lick the tip at the end of it. When she reached the hole, she moved it along the inside of her mouth. "Mmm," she mumbled around it, "and I love kissing your dick." She opened her mouth to take him in and then released it as she began bobbing up and down in response to the sensations.</p> <p>A knock sounded at the door and Sam yelled, "Come on in."</p> <p>A woman came in, and she noticed Sam's hardon sticking out of Sam's gym shorts, but the rest of it made her a bit uncomfortable. She tried to get the door open so she could speak to Sam, but nothing was going on.</p> <p>Sam's voice broke the tension. "Come in and I'll get a glass of wine you drink to help relieve the tension."</p> <p>The woman walked through the doorway. She was wearing a t-shirt, but it still left little to the imagination. She was not tall, but she looked like a runway model. Her short brown hair was tied up in a ponytail and her hazel eyes had a look of confidence that looked familiar somehow.</p> <p>Looking back at Sam, she nodded and walked toward her. He was standing in one of the side booths at the bar. He was wearing a black shirt that almost looked like an office. His hair was styled back, and he had the same look on his face as his girlfriend had. He was not wearing a shirt either.</p> <p>"You seem tense," she said, looking at Sam. "Have you been working out?"</p> <p>"The gym's not my thing."</p> <p>"Yeah, maybe," Sam said with a laugh. "We're just like you, not as athletes, and I thought you had a really good body."</p> <p>He leaned in close to her and began to brush the side of her face with his lips. She shivered from his touch and he brought his hands to rest on her hips, his hands sliding down the outside of them as he rubbed her thighs. He looked down. When his eyes met hers, her pupils were wide and her face looked dreamy.</p> <p>The idea of how the day had gone so far was exciting. Sam's hands slid up to her waist in a gesture that sent the message to her. She felt wetness between her legs and knew that he was aware.</p> <p>"I thought we could move to the corner of the room," he drawled. "Let I take the other one."</p> <p>Sam's hands moved from her hips to her back and then pulled her to him. It felt as if she melted into him. His mouth moved down her neck. He nipped her earlobe. She let out a soft moan, but it didn't do much to get her mind off of the situation. The smell of her perfume hit him from the corner of his nose. She could feel his erection pressing into her.</p> <p>"I'm going to suck you off before we go into the bedroom," Sam whispered to her as he stood close enough to kiss her.</p> <p>She felt like he was on fire. His hand squeezed her ass while he kissed her as he squeezed her tits. She was getting moist. There were no underwear in sight. His kisses had her so turned on when she had the door open and the light turned off that it was going out the window. When a man in a T-shirt and sweat pants entered the room, the shock of realization made her realize that she had made the whole thing up.</p> <p>"Sam, honey, are you okay?"</p> <p>Sensation from his breath caused her mouth to open, so he kissed that, too. When his lips pressed against her neck, she tilted forward, her hands reaching into his pants for his cock. They kissed long and hot against each other's lips. She could feel how hard his dick was. Her nipples stiffened in her bra. It felt as if there were a bolt of lightening at the base of her spine. They broke the kiss. She turned to face him and pulled his mouth back roughly to her own for a deep, tongue-swirling kiss. Their tongues danced together, and then separated.</p> <p>Sam pulled back and grinned. "I think I'm going to have a run in the hotel," he said with a devilish grin that made her laugh.</p> <p>"Okay," she replied, "maybe later? Let's go grab something to eat and hit the beach." She moved out of his arms after taking the opportunity to slip her robe around her as she walked to the hallway in the nude.</p> <p>The moment that she opened the door to enter their room she gave him a look that said she expected him to say, â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
