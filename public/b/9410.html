There's nothing that I wouldn't want to do to you." Mom said.</p> <p>I looked over at Mom and could see her face getting redder and redder as the excitement was building in her.</p> <p>"Are you still going with Steve?" she asked.</p> <p>"No, I'm with Brad. He's a good friend of mine and we're pretty good friends." Mom said.</p> <p>"I'm glad we can be friends. I told you that I am very unhappy with Mom and I'll be there to help out with anything she has to do." I said, not wanting to sound bad like Mom and not wanting to appear bad in front of her family.</p> <p>"Steve, I don't know what has gotten into you and it's not just what Mom has done to me but also what she asked me to do for her. We have to get on with our lives." she panted.</p> <p>The entire day went by much as Mom was trying to convince me not to hang out with Brad. I was happy to find that Mom was trying very hard. If I was being totally honest with myself and if she was doing the right thing Mom was doing that would be a positive factor in my life.</p> <p>The afternoon passed and I was having a great day with my two ladies as I sipped a beer. I went over and sat down with my mom and then headed back to the game room.</p> <p>"Ok, so you want to talk about your mom and me going over the past few days since you lost her. You don't want to talk about now, do you? Ok, so what now?" I asked.</p> <p>"Well, I'm curious as to why Mom went so long to say goodbye today," she said.</p> <p>"I'm not that concerned about what my mom did with Steve, honey," I said, not really realizing that I was thinking what sounded good to me and not what she asked me to do.</p> <p>"Mom, do you miss him?" I asked.</p> <p>"No, I don't understand how he can go on," she sighed.</p> <p>"If I am honest with myself, I think he's a lucky young guy to have one man like you in his life," I said.</p> <p>"Do you miss talking to your girl friends?" she asked.</p> <p>"No, they don't want to talk to me but I am looking for that kind of comfort. When I was in school it was easy for me to say hello to other girls and to see if I could talk to a girl," I said.</p> <p>"Mom, I'm just saying you should get over yourself if you like. If it helps you, it will make your life easier and all will be good." I said.</p> <p>"Do you think that's fair that I ask Steve for something that we wouldn't even ask him?" she asked.</p> <p>"You already made that very clear, honey. Just go in and ask him." I said, knowing that she'd do what I asked for her.</p> <p>"I will, and I will, honey. I was afraid he might be interested in what I had to say about him, you know." she said.</p> <p>"You're sure?" I asked knowing that Mom was willing to talk to Steve about anything.</p> <p>"Yes, I'm sure." she chuckled.</p> <p>My next question to ask her seemed to get her to take her son upstairs with her for a walk and talk.</p> <p>"Mom, don't tell Steve anything," I said. "Don't worry about him."</p> <p>"I'm sure he won't tell anyone. Just go with what you want. What happens in this house stays in this home," she said, "and I know just the girl friends that you would like to have if you had that kind of trust. I think Steve's very likely to approve everything that you have planned for our wedding. You don't know everything about Steve from what she told me. So you just go for it. She will never know." I said.</p> <p>That would probably be an excellent advice to take, as I know Steve would love to go with Mom to get what we wanted.</p> <p>I drove Mom back to town and parked next to Brad's old pickup. It was our usual Saturday and they both took it to the park. I pulled up in front of the park and she pulled into the drive way.</p> <p>"I have been driving back here this morning and I know that Brad has been spending some time in the garden and that his parents might come down for lunch. I'm sure they will be pleased to meet up with usâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
