She leaned back against his chest. He could feel a little warmth creeping up the outside of his thighs as he sat there, wondering what she was thinking. He had not intended to feel that way. He had, after all, never felt anything but her hands on him. This time perhaps, if no one happened, he would have no regrets about it. Just the thought of it, however, was not his strong preference.</p> <p>There was, however, an unexpected feeling of excitement, of course, in being touched when he sat there, with his hand on and feeling up her, while his body was pressed up against her. He could feel his breath quicken, and heard his heart thump. He didn't know what to do. He glanced down at her body to see that she was holding hers against him.</p> <p>She was not looking directly at him, but rather, she was looking at a long dark black furred eye, just above her pussy, the one that he had first felt touching him, a moment before, just before, he wanted to let himself cum, but that he knew that no way would make it happen. She sat there with one leg draped across his legs. He could feel her warm and moist pussy slide up and down his cock while she held him there, his hand on her right breast, his heart thumping hard against her breast the whole time. Her breath was coming in quick little gasps.</p> <p>She leaned up against the front of the car, and suddenly reached her hand over from behind him on to the top of his left thigh, and ran the finger up his cock. He jumped and jumped again. The feeling was incredible. He almost came right then with a jerk.</p> <p>Her hand slowly reached his dick, and ran her finger over the head to get it covered again and again. He jerked again. The whole time she was stroking herself. He was going to lose it. She did this a few more times, until he was moaning and quivering. Finally, she let him slip out of her.</p> <p>He stood up and staggered out of the hot tub. She was still on her side facing him, facing the car. He saw something shining on her face and realized that she was stroking his dick through the water. It was huge, and it was almost purple.</p> <p>"You're big," she said, giggled, looking up at him. "Don't tell me that you aren't getting your dick sucked."</p> <p>He laughed a little. "I'm not, but..."</p> <p>"Oh, no?" she said, licking her lips. "I don't care what my body tells me. You've got the best, thickest cock that has ever gone down on me. God, it's so big. It's the size of my finger and is, well, I've got to have it!"</p> <p>He stood there for a moment, listening to her talk. He wasn't sure what she was saying, but he knew what he thought of it. She had a mouth like a whore's. He figured that she was a whore. She might have had his entire dick, in one hand. He didn't think she'd use that word.</p> <p>She turned to get out of the hot tub, and he stood there wondering why he could just stand there, and she had turned towards him, like he did. She was facing the car, but was still holding onto his cock, which was half out of water, half hanging down. She reached back and squeezed it, leaned over and grabbed his big hanging dick. "Don't let it slip away!" she panted. She turned back.</p> <p>"I guess so. I want it all."</p> <p>She gave it a couple pumps. It seemed as if it was getting larger, and then suddenly she stopped.</p> <p>"It looks like you may have had me completely to yourself, though." She laughed a little, then turned and took his dick back in her hand now, stroking it slowly. "Come on. You don't have to come, if you don't want to." She leaned in and kissed him. He could taste his own cum in the kiss and feel himself responding. She put his dick back in her mouth, and he could feel himself start to move, wanting to come.</p> <p>"Wait, what?" he said.</p> <p>She pushed her mouth down to the end of his dick, making it slip out. "Wait. I want to do something else!"</p> <p>He could not believe how she asked that. That's all it seemed to be, because she sat up on the end of his shaft and ran the tip over her breasts up and down her belly, then moved her body down until his dick was almost at her pussy. When she was there, she put the tip inside her, and she rocked forward. He could see herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
