"But I'll still call her."</p> <p>"You won't get away with that," I said. "After all, you're a little late."</p> <p>With that, Mike started pushing a cock into my mouth.</p> <p>"Oh, God, yes," I hissed under my breath.</p> <p>Mike started ramming it down my throat while I sucked on his balls. It was hard, but I got to work. It didn't take long. He was thrusting wildly now and I could hear him groaning. Then, he pushed his cock out of my mouth and sprayed his semen all over my face, neck & tits. It was warm and thick on my skin. It felt gooey. I was breathing hard.</p> <p>Mike pulled his cock out of my mouth and zipped back up.</p> <p>"How long will you be?" I asked.</p> <p>"A little while," he said. He took his clothes back on. "I have to go to the bathroom."</p> <p>"Will you call me?"</p> <p>"I think so. I think it would really be a lot nicer."</p> <p>"I'd like to call you, Mike."</p> <p>Mike got dressed and got back into his car and I heard the driver door shut. Then I heard something and the car started up again. Mike came back in the car and shut the door. He pulled his shorts back on.</p> <p>"What was that?" I asked.</p> <p>"The condom."</p> <p>"You can't have a condom! You can't even have that in a room!"</p> <p>"Oh, well, yeah, sure," said Mike, walking over to his truck. He opened my door, got in his car and began driving while I fidgeted and put my hand on my mound. I was too afraid to touch my vagina, as if it would come in contact with him. A minute or so later we arrived in Santa Monica and Mike pulled into the garage. "What's so terrible about that neighborhood?" I asked him. "It's not like New Jersey," he said, turning the truck towards the house. As he drove out of the garage, he pulled me off my seat. He pulled me to him and kissed me quickly, running his fingers through my hair. He pulled away when I put my hand on his thigh.</p> <p>"I just can't bear for you to go out to dinner with Mike." After a couple of minutes, he had pulled a blanket out of the back seat and was putting it over me.</p> <p>"Don't worry about it," I said. "I'll be fine for a couple of hours."</p> <p>"You don't even have to go, you know," he said. "You don't have to meet everyone here."</p> <p>"Are you fucking kidding me?"</p> <p>"No," he said matter-of-factly. "All my employees are in the building."</p> <p>I got a big smile and sat there like a frightened rabbit. I got up and put on my dress while he drove to the restaurant. As soon as I got inside, he had pulled off his tie and his shirt came off. I wanted to kiss him, but there was nothing in the world I wanted to do right then.</p> <p>"Mike," I said.</p> <p>Mike just grinned at me. He looked back and started stroking my hair. "All my employees," he said. "All my employees will be naked and doing the work."</p> <p>"God help me," I said, looking at the ceiling. "I'll be your sex slave and be your sex slave forever."</p> <p>He looked at me. I think he started to laugh.</p> <p>"No!" I said, and then stopped him before he could continue. "No sex today. Not today."</p> <p>He just patted me on the shoulder and drove off. I got off the truck and went inside. The receptionist, with her arm around Sharon, was busy cleaning the counter. Mike came in and told us about the dinner. We talked about the neighborhood, the neighborhood, Sharon's house, mine and my own house. I found out they had a new pool which they use occasionally all over the house. After dinner, they invited us in for the evening's entertainment. Mike asked if we would take their swimming suits off. I didn't have anything in my bag.</p> <p>After I had showered, I was lying on the bed with my eyes closed when Mike came over. He was standing in the doorway. As soon as he saw me, I started to open them again, but Mike grabbed my wrists.</p> <p>"No!" I cried. "Please don't."</p> <p>He held them together and then stepped close to my side to take me in his arms. After about five seconds, he leaned his head on my shoulder and we kissed. Our tongues movedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
