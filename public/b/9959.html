She pressed against me, her hand sliding down further under my towel to cup my cock. She brought it up and pressed her nipple into my lips. "I'm ready." I kissed, sucked and kissed her. I ran my hand up her thigh and she spread a bit. At the base of her thighs, her hand moved my way up to cup her breasts. I was looking down to see her nipple harden, the first nipple of her body. I took her nipple in my mouth, and sucked one while stroking her other. "It feels like you're ready to have me..." I ran my hand from one nipple, down her body to her hip. Her hips lifted up and she pulled me down on her.</p> <p>I put both hands on her, her back arched, her full breasts pushed into my face. I let my lips leave hers and traced her nipple with my tongue until it was a deep red. A few fingers slid the strap of her bra aside so they could rub over her nipple, but I pulled away so I was cupping her breast with one hand.</p> <p>"I can't...," she began.</p> <p>"Shh," I finished, but then moved to lay on top of her as she grabbed the edges of our towels. "I said you could do it, honey."</p> <p>"But there's no time or..."</p> <p>I looked at her. Her face was flushed, but her eyes were bright with excitement and excitement. I lay back on of her and she moved down, her body moving close to mine. I took her nipples between my fingers and took them between my lips.</p> <p>"Mmmm, honey, that feels good," she said.</p> <p>"I'm glad I don't have to do this every day," I assured her, and rolled over. "But I do have to do this. Let me lie on top of you."</p> <p>"I'm hungry." I leaned over and kissed her. Her arms wrapped around me, and we fell on the blanket. My hands worked up and down her body over her wetness until I had the sheet and blankets all wet, and we lay in each other arms for a short time.</p> <p>"I want us to do this some more," she said. "But not every time. Tonight, I want us to really make love. Right now." Her hand found the outline of my cock, and I moaned softly into her mouth. "I don't want you to think of it as being just you two sharing the moment."</p> <p>"I'm yours, my beautiful young goddess," I smiled as I kissed her, and pulled her close to me. "Ohhh, I want you so badly." She ran a hand through my hair, then back down to my cock and brought it to her.</p> <p>"Come on," she moaned, so as a reward for having pleasured me so thoroughly and so soon, I wanted to see her in the most intimate of moments. "Take off those pants," I ordered, turning to the side.</p> <p>"Oh no, not right now." She slid her hands down to her hips as I raised one knee to slide off. She stepped out of them, then moved her leg over to get between mine. She had to pull the sheet up over my hips to keep from getting my cock wet. "What are you wearing?" she giggled. "I mean, what is it?"</p> <p>"A bikini. Why?"</p> <p>"Just because you're gorgeous? You look so fucking sexy, when you are." I reached down to pull off the top. But it had to go because we were both naked now. I felt her hand on my cock, feeling like it was the center of my universe. "Just lie back, okay?"</p> <p>I lay in bed with her breasts on my chest and watched her face. Her eyes closed, her lips curled into a smile. Then she was asleep, leaving a large wet spot in the sheet that quickly slid down my body.</p> <p>I knew I was not going do this, and I knew I couldn't stop myself. It wouldn't be right if I did something like this. I had never done this in my life. I had never even thought about doing this, and now I wanted to do it so badly. I was getting off on it. If I didn't do this by going to a sex club I wouldn't be able to stop thinking about it again. It was all I saw, the look on the faces of the men and women, and I wondered what a few would do if the other men or women had the opportunity.</p> <p>It took me a moment to figure out what I was about to do, but I was quickly at that exact moment. I turned on my side to look at Amber. She was looking back at me.
