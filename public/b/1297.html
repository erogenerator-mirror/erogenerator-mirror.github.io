I was beginning to wonder if you'd show."</p> <p>We both gave a little laugh. We started undressing. We were both in our bathing suits when I turned around to face the tree. I felt my face blush as the cool air hit it. I looked back at my sister as I undressed. She looked a little apprehensive about what was to come, but that didn't bother me. We didn't speak for a bit, but my heart began to pound. We heard someone run in the other directions, and then I heard the front door open. We froze. The girl was standing in front of the door at the same time that I was. I was terrified, but also excited, knowing there was no going back.</p> <p>"I'm sorry!"</p> <p>I jumped up and ran for the door. I heard her open and close the door behind me. Then I saw her run back into the house, down the stairs, and then out of vision. I felt my hands tremble and my heart beat like it was beating out of my chest. Her arms were wrapped around me and her breathing was hard. She began to say something, but it was so soft and innocent. All I could think about was how good it felt to be with her. I had no idea how long she had stood there, except that she had stopped when she spotted me. Without realizing it though, I had let her run back into the house, and I had followed her.</p> <p>It wasn't long before we were lying on the bed wrapped in each other's arms. I was on top of her, my weight on her, and felt myself getting hard. What had I let myself do? How could I have been so stupid? Was this what happens when you fall in love? I wanted desperately to lie there forever, but then I felt a strange pleasure run through me. She wasn't as much like my sister. She was a little bit on the petite side. But with her she'd only had her small 34C breasts. When you're in love, you lose the size of your breasts. Her body looked even more amazing than I remembered. I let my self be drawn to her chest, and I felt the same pleasure when I had run my hands over her stomach. I had been so focused on her, that I hadn't realized the effect my hands had on her. It made her feel so good, and I could still feel myself moving from her heart to her breasts. Her breathing was so quick and shallow, my breath on her lips.</p> <p>My fingers traced a path slowly up her body until I reached her mouth. I was surprised at how warm and inviting it was. I could feel myself harden and rise to her, and she was as nervous as I was. I felt the warmth of her body on mine, her breathing getting faster, and her lips pressed against mine as our arms tightened around each other. I finally broke the kiss with a laugh as I pulled away to look at her. It was as if we'd never had that much time to ourselves. Her eyes went wide and she smiled.</p> <p>"You're not doing anything, are you?"</p> <p>"Oh no! You're doing great, but I'm afraid." She laughed nervously. "I want to make love to you bad. We don't have to do anything if you don't want to. I just wanted to do this, that's all."</p> <p>I kissed her again as I held her tight. We lay in each other's embrace for a long time. Nothing else mattered to me. The last time we made love was more than twelve days ago. We had been making love for almost six hours before I finally said I wanted to try something.</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>I could feel a rush of excitement build inside me. This time I wanted nothing more than to make love with my sister. I wanted her to make the same kind of love that I had for the past couple days. I knew it would feel as good as the last time.</p> <p>"I want to."</p> <p>I lay her down on the bed. She got up on her hands and knees. I couldn't stop myself though. I leaned down and began kissing her neck. I could feel her body respond. I kissed her ears and neck. I could smell and smell her skin as I kissed her. I kissed down her neck, and down over her shoulders to her breasts. The nipples were hard, and I pulled on them gently with my lips. The areolas were pink and puffy. I opened my fingers and began to flick the nipples with my tongue. She let out a moan, feeling pleasure run down my body, and down my spine. I continued to suck on her nipples as I pushed one breast into my mouth.
