The buttons came down easily; she started with the top buttons. When she was done, she slid his shirt off along with shoes. He kicked off his shoes as she started to pull his pants down. Then she reached in his pants and pulled some panties down as he raised himself off the couch and stepped out of them. She looked at his face and knew he was nervous.</p> <p>"It's not funny," she said as she reached her hand over and gave his dick a squeeze. His penis started to grow as she grabbed it. He didn't have the full length of him, but the thickness made up for it. She squeezed his balls and pulled down on them. This caused him to moan. She looked down and his dick was bigger than he could ever remember. She let go of it and started to stroke it. His head and the little bit of her lips, which she was holding behind his balls, were wrapped tightly around his shaft. He was almost there.</p> <p>"Ah! My, my," Mike said with a moan. She continued to stroke him. She put more force behind her hand as she did. His eyes closed as he neared climax. She removed her hand and sat up. Looking like she was taking a breath, she put both hands back on his erection and began to stroke.</p> <p>"Please," Mike said quietly. "I've never... I want to make love to you." He didn't understand why she was stroking him and he knew she was trying to keep from letting go. She continued to stroke him and he was about to cum, when he felt a warmth travel through his body. He started to buck his hips off the couch so hard she'd have trouble keeping up. She continued to stroke him until her grip on his shaft had completely gone. He was spent and had nothing left. She looked at him and saw a small smile on his face.</p> <p>"I guess I don't have to," she said softly. "I want that back." She got up off of her knees and kneeled in front of him.</p> <p>"You're right," he agreed. "Let's not leave this room for the rest of the night. If you want to get naked again, then we can go." She smiled and stood up. Mike stood as well. She smiled and kissed him.</p> <p>"I'm not done. I want you to put your penis into me," she said. As she reached for him, he got his cock out of his pants. He placed the head of his penis between her soft lips, which were now wet with her semen. He put his hands on her waist and pushed himself deeper into her. She lifted herself up slightly and moaned softly again. He pushed harder which had the feeling of having something inside her. Mike's penis sank into her and she was completely empty.</p> <p>"It's beautiful," she whispered. She put her arms around his neck and kissed him. As their tongues danced over each others, they started to move slowly. Mike's hips moved to her every movement. He was sliding his penis in and out of her slowly.</p> <p>"Please make love to me, Mike," she begged. Their bodies matched each other. They were as one. It was beautiful. It was not going to be long before they would be one.</p> <p>"I want you to come on my face," she whispered. With each of his upward thrusts of her hips, her chin and lips would touch him. He could feel her body heat as his skin slid over her tongue. He could even feel her clit. Her juices were gathering on his cock. She was moving faster and faster. She screamed loudly as her body shook uncontrollably. He could feel her juices flowing over his penis, and she pushed his body hard into hers as her orgasm washed over her. His shaft started to spurt hot cum into her pussy. He could even feel her cervix when she came hard. They came close together and looked into each other's eyes. He smiled and reached out and gave her a hug.</p> <p>"You're beautiful," he whispered as he bent over and kissed her cheek. She turned her head and kissed it as they rolled over, her legs over his and he was still inside her. They lay together for sometime, looking at each other. It was the most intimate time of their lives. After what had just happened they did kiss one last time, but he said nothing. They lay there, his arms around her. Finally, Mike went to get up and she said</p> <p>"Would you... would you stay?" she asked. He knew what she wanted and was glad she'd ask for it.</p> <p>"I'd stay what?"</p> <p>"If you want me to stay," she replied. He looked at her sadly.
