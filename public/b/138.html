This is your time"</p> <p>He smiled, a light, very gentle smile, then said, "I'll be back."</p> <p>It was now that the second time for me to get my hands and face fucked, I noticed his hands were now outstretched and I could actually feel my tits. They felt real heavy. He must be able to feel my nipples through the thin fabric! I was afraid to remove them; and I don't think it would hurt, but they felt real hard and a bit like a rock. I wasn't sure, but I think he noticed because he lowered his head, kissing my ear, and whispered, "Go on and get your arms and legs in that stirrup. When you are ready, we will get you situated."</p> <p>I didn't need to be asked twice, although I had to stretch my legs up as I got into the stirrup, then he was on the ground again. "When I get that down, you have to spread your legs." He commanded me. I did as he said. As I did, I saw my pussy juices start, and the little white spot appeared in the background of my juices on the floor next. "What?" I asked.</p> <p>He said, "I said you had to spread your legs."</p> <p>"Yes, I spread them. I think that's what I want to talk about."</p> <p>"Yes, it is. But first, I want you to sit in this chair. You are to be on your back and you are only to do this when I say to you to," he said. And I could tell that he meant it just as much as I did. I don't know if I could do it, but I could feel a certain excitement inside me and I knew that I would do it as I was bound or on display. Besides, this is one of those "I'm tied " things; and they really felt sexy, but it was humiliating.</p> <p>As I sat on my back, he said, "Are you having a good time?"</p> <p>"Yes, I'm good! It's kind of a nice feeling doing this. I'm so relaxed now, I think we can take it one day at a time. I feel like nothing else in the entire afternoon, or so I've been told by others."</p> <p>"I'll bet you are." He smiled. "I'm the one who is here now."</p> <p>"You are, huh?"</p> <p>"Well, not all guys are that way. A while ago, I was tied to a table. One leg was tied, which pulled it up so I could lean on it, which left the other leg pulled down on the other side."</p> <p>"Is your ass that big?"</p> <p>"Yes." I looked at him. "My ass is just for you. I have always been afraid it would be bigger than my whole body."</p> <p>"Can I touch it?"</p> <p>"Of course you can," I laughed.</p> <p>We were in no hurry to get his cock and balls inside of me. As I said, he was kind of a big dude, and a very strong guy... a "man" with an impressive length, and a size I could actually describe (in about 2 minutes).</p> <p>We were just getting into the "I-can't-believe-it-in-you" stuff when he said, "OK. There isn't any lubricant in this dress, so you need to get on your stomach."</p> <p>"Don't worry about the condom, I won't." I said with a smile.</p> <p>"No underwear?"</p> <p>"No, just this dress." When he was done, I opened the door, stepped inside, and we were back at his table, where we finished up and had lunch.</p> <p>My first session was, again, very sexy. His hands were roaming all over my back and, as we sat in the chairs (or at his table) again, the other patrons seemed to like it, too. I could feel his hands moving on my body, on my legs. When he rubbed my ass through the dress I could tell it was "really horny".</p> <p>I had this desire to touch him and touch him. To have his hands there, on my crotch, with just the slightest pressure on my clit, could really get me going! I don't think he ever touched my clit in a sexual way. But I really wanted to.</p> <p>We finished lunch, then he was going to go home. We were both so ready to enjoy the experience I was surprised he was still up, though. "Are you coming home with me?" I asked.</p> <p>"Oh, I suppose you'd be OK with that."</p> <p>I said, "I might have a few questions; what was I to do before getting all tied upâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
