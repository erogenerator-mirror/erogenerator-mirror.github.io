I kissed my inner thighs. I kissed the little triangle at the top of the thigh, and gently licked it. I could smell the arousal.</p> <p>I parted my legs wide and ran warm oil all the way up each thigh, up one leg to the knee and thighs, before returning to my breasts. I spread the oil over both my breasts. My nipples were so hard. So sensitive. So sensitive. My pussy was now so wet. I wanted more. I slowly slid the thin straps of my skimpy bra down my arms. I could feel it on my hand, and felt it was soaked through my knickers.</p> <p>I removed them. I could feel a drop of my juices running out of me. My fingers ran through my bush. I ran my fingers through my curls and through my crack. I closed my eyes and imagined his tongue fucking my cunt. My fingers lightly trailed their fingers down past my arse and down the crack, back up to my clit. I touched it, running my fingertips over the skin, then moving down again. I slid down on to the bed and lay flat on my back.</p> <p>I felt his hands on my body. He rubbed the oil onto my tits, across them and across my nipples. He licked them, I could feel they were burning. He slid one hand down between my thighs. I felt his finger glide over my pussy lips, pushing against my clitoris. He moved it back and forth, feeling my wetness. He slid a third finger into me. I pushed with my hips and held him against me as his finger pumped in and out of me.</p> <p>I arched my back a little as he pushed his finger in and out. He slowly started to massage my clit as his fingers continued to rub it.</p> <p>Suddenly he pulled his fingers away. With a quick movement he flipped me onto my stomach. He pulled my hair back, so the top lay back, exposing me to him. I could feel every movement of his hand as he did this, his fingers running through my hair.</p> <p>He kissed the end of my ear. Again, I could feel him breathing on it, his breath warm on me.</p> <p>"Are you ready to do this?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Are you ready, to do this?" he said as he kissed my cheek.</p> <p>I lifted my leg to allow him to move between my thighs. I was so wet. I could feel the heat of my pussy spread across the cheeks of my arse as his fingers found my pussy. I lifted my hips until I could feel his fingers probing. I could hear his breath as he found my clit. I felt the pleasure of having him touch me there. I had to come. I started to move my hips a little. As much as it sounded strange to me now, I was so excited that I was starting to feel myself coming.</p> <p>Suddenly he stopped. With great regret, he pushed his fingers away. I heard him draw on a couple of swipes of his tongue on the bottom of my clit, before moving his fingers to my arse again. His fingers, his fingers that had just pushed into me, replaced his tongue. Slowly he pushed a finger, then a second, into my arse. He pushed. Then pushed once more. With his hands on my shoulders, he pushed harder, thrust himself in deeper and harder.</p> <p>I felt completely out of control.</p> <p>I felt his hard cock against me. I had my hand around it. I needed it.</p> <p>I felt him move his hips from between my thighs. I felt pressure in my arse as he thrust his cock in and out me as I felt it sliding against my lips. I lifted myself a little. I wanted him to touch me there. Wanted him to see my pussy cumming.</p> <p>I held my lips apart, feeling his cock rub and press against me. But he didn't. It was too much. Too much. I didn't want him to see me, not until I knew, that it was OK with him. And then I had the first of many, many new orgasms. Suddenly it was so intense, so wonderful. I came just as he came inside me, again and again.</p> <p>When he slid out of me, I felt his cum run out of me, onto the sheets. I was in a fog of ecstasy. Slowly he lowered himself on the bed beside me.</p> <p>"My cock?" he asked.</p> <p>I didn't answer. I just lay there, still feeling the heat of his cock. I needed more. His fingers gently ran over my clit. It was burning again.</p> <p>"Do you want it again?" he asked. "Do you want to fuck you again?"</p> <p>Withâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
