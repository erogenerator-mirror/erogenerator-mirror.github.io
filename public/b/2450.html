He slid his right hand up to the front of me and cupped my right breast. It felt wonderful. I didn't know how or even think I would feel about that but I knew I liked it. I liked it a lot. It just made everything that much more exciting.</p> <p>As I sat there watching him, I could see his left hand sliding up from my leg toward my pussy. When he was close enough to me he slipped a finger into me and started to slide it in and out. He was making little circles around my clit all the time.</p> <p>I really liked it too, I just sat back and enjoyed him doing so. At first I wasn't sure exactly what he was doing but then I was really turned on. It was almost as if he was making love to me, he was really making love his lips and tongue were on my breasts. After a while I really wished I could be with him too, but my desire wasn't there anymore. I just wanted to enjoy sex with him.</p> <p>I don't know if it was the alcohol or if he noticed, but I didn't care. In fact, I really wanted to take things to a new level. I don't think he even knew I was even there, let alone that I was there, even if he did.</p> <p>After a while I just had to take something, anything in the world, out of the equation. So there I sat, half naked, in his lap, his hand still making little circles around my pussy and his lips still taking the shape of one nipple as he sucked on the other. I wasn't sure how far he might be willing to take things. I mean he did, he had one knee up on the chair when he sat down but he was still leaning down so his mouth was covering the one ear. He was kissing one of my ears and gently biting it. He even used his teeth to gently nibble on and pull on my hair every now and again. It was the most erotic thing I had ever seen.</p> <p>It also surprised me a little too as it occurred to me that I was totally out of control and out of control of my entire body. I could feel the orgasm rising within me again as my head was pulled back even more.</p> <p>Then it was like he took over kissing and biting my ear, I wanted to try to get away but that didn't happen, it just came on me and there I was, naked on the bar, kissing one man, holding the other hand on my leg, the one just inside my pussy and, I realized, his lips all over my body. I wanted to do it but the situation was so crazy-hot. I wanted it to end but this was all too real, too real. After it happened so suddenly to me and was almost an afterthought, all of a sudden I was there again.</p> <p>When I started to cum from the power of what he had felt, of watching all of this, I did just that. I really didn't care it was almost as if I was doing it without even knowing what was going on. It was so hot in and yet so wrong. I just went with it, I just didn't care.</p> <p>I didn't even think that the person watching had come to see what I was doing, it just happened.</p> <p>Eventually the whole thing ended. But by then I had stopped it all. I was more than happy. I was so happy and yet I think I had been so turned off. I had never felt so loved before.</p> <p>After getting a bit of a chance to get even more of what had just happened I went to him saying, "Thanks, that was really very nice, you weren't so rough with me." I was still naked and still horny, but I really wasn't at that point. I was still so in tune with what was going on, how crazy was it? In my mind I started to picture our little game on all levels as it seemed.</p> <p>We talked all this while talking and he would go in to finish his drink. I had finished mine as well as the ones he had been passing around to himself but it was always just as I had downed mine the first time.</p> <p>"I think you might want to take a little nap, you might feel some of us might wake you up, after you slept so long I'm afraid that you are going to have a hard time."</p> <p>"Actually it is a pretty difficult habit," I said while I looked up at him.</p> <p>"That's fine, I think you'll have a very good time."</p> <p>"Thank you," I replied. I really didn't want to but just sat there while he put on another one.
