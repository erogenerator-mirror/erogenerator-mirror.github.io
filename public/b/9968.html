"Are you still upset about it?"</p> <p>"If you were, I would not have come!"</p> <p>I laughed, "I have had sex with one woman before, and I never loved her for what happened before."</p> <p>"Well that was not what I am going to do, John," she said, her voice full of sadness. "Don't worry about it."</p> <p>I smiled at her and went to take my turn at giving her a hand job.</p> <p>She looked down at my hand and looked up at me. "John, what made me want to go to a strip club and have sex with a man?"</p> <p>"You have to believe me," I said, "I would never do it. I just don't want to go into it with you and talk about it about. Let's just say I don't want to get into trouble while I'm working my own business, okay?"</p> <p>"That's fine with me. I am glad you are not going to. I just have to make sure you understand what is being done here."</p> <p>"Yes," I said, "that was my idea."</p> <p>Her response was more than I expected. She sat back in her chair and leaned over to me and kissed me. Her tongue slipped into my mouth and mine met hers with a growing urgency that she would soon understand in my own mind. Her hand snaked up my thigh and found my cock. She stroked it under the water and I was already beginning to swell. My cock was now at full staff when we broke the kiss. She grabbed my cock under the water and began stroking it. I looked over to her and the pleasure on my face was evident. She looked down and then looked up at me until the head of my cock was pointing directly in her face.</p> <p>She kissed the head of my cock, "Now it is my turn," she said.</p> <p>She opened her mouth and took my cock head into her mouth. She ran the crown between her lips, teasing the rim with her tongue. She had taken me all the way in and just held me there. Her tongue worked on the underside of my cock, lapping at my glans like a tiny kitten. I looked over at her and she was lying back on her chair, her arms above her head. Her head was turned to the side and her lips were parted and moving slightly as she watched me and I looked over to see her waiting as I took a drink of water. Her head was slowly tilted back and I could see the top of her head moving with each of my thrusts. It was one of the most erotic things I had ever witnessed.</p> <p>We had been watching each other for weeks now and knew that it would not last. A part of me thought it would be best if we had another drink first so we could continue this way. So I had. I had another reason to be here. I wanted her to be happy, with a man, so to speak.</p> <p>The look on her face when she saw my cock head was one of pure passion and desire. She had only dreamed of it for months and now it was about to happen. I wanted so badly to see if she was feeling happy or if this was about to start and she would soon tell me that she was going to let me feel her body inside this time.</p> <p>She moved her arms and reached down between her legs. I moved over to join her and as we kissed, I put one hand on her hip, the other on her pussy. As we kissed, I caressed the lips of her pussy with my fingers which caused her to squirm. I brought one finger to the opening of her pussy and found that she had been wet already. I inserted a finger and she spread her lips with her hand, allowing me more access. I slid the tip of my middle finger into the wetness and it slid in without a problem. I held my finger there and she felt me pushing her pussy walls apart. Our kisses became more urgent and she wrapped her legs around my leg and began humping me.</p> <p>I pulled my finger out and felt a rush of wetness as she squirted juice over my hand. I had never tasted that as fresh or as strong in all my life. I wanted to taste every drop. I pushed my hand out to the side of her body and looked into her eyes as she lay face up on the seat. Her lips were pursed and her eyes were half closed. I lowered my head to her and kissed her lips, her cheeks, her chin. I kissed her lips and then let my tongue dart into her mouth. She responded and I sucked on her tongue. Our kisses continued as I reached to my pants and fumbled for my hard dick. By the time I felt the pre-cum moisten my finger, we had brought ourselves to orgasm together. We kissed again more quickly andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
