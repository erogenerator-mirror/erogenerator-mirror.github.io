He sat down. He had a beer in one hand and his friends, his friends, his friends, took theirs and the others. They looked over at her.</p> <p>"Are you?" he looked her over.</p> <p>"Oh yes! I have been trying to make up to myself for a long time!"</p> <p>"You're beautiful, sweetheart," he was smiling. He had a drink in his hand and he reached for it. She watched it, still feeling a bit of panic. He handed it to her and she took a sip. She smiled at him, took a sip and placed it in her mouth. He smiled down at her, and then reached one of his bottles of beer in his other hand. She looked at the bottle of water in his hand and at the beer on the night stand that looked like a small glass. "I've got it."</p> <p>She walked out of the restaurant and down the hallway to her apartment. She knew it was time to let herself go again. She needed to just let herself go. She closed the door and went to her bedroom. She pulled the nightstand out and sat on her bed. She went down on her knees and took off her shoes and then went over to her nightstand. She took a deep breath to go back to her purse and check her phone. She was just about to go back to her apartment when she heard the door.</p> <p>"Hey," he said. He was standing there looking at her. He took a sip of beer and smiled at her. "Hey, how's it going?"</p> <p>"I'm good," he smiled. "We're gonna make this up to you."</p> <p>"How?"</p> <p>"Hey, I'll take a shower."</p> <p>"Okay. You'll join me if you want."</p> <p>"Okay," she said. She looked down at her feet and thought for a minute. "Will this count as joining or will I go alone?"</p> <p>He sighed. "You're mine now, and you'll do whatever I tell you. Do whatever I tell you."</p> <p>"Okay," she said. Her hands dropped to her blouse and her hand slipped under the flimsy shirt. She reached into her little white bra and found the nipple and she let her hand feel around it. Her mind went blank. "Ohhh. Ohhh" began to seep from her lips. She heard him inhale. She smiled as her mind was in an erotic state.</p> <p>He reached out, lifted her bra and her shirt, tossed it onto the bed, and then pulled off her panties. The cool air on her bare skin sent shivers through her body. She knew that he would find it pretty, her little pussy already wet with anticipation. He lifted her legs up and apart and she felt a trickle of something at the lips of her wet cunt. Her eyes went wide at the feeling of pleasure.</p> <p>His cock was hard in his pants and he wanted to make sure she saw it. He climbed up onto the bed and she felt it press between her legs. She felt him move between her legs as she looked down. His cock was hard and she saw the little tip where he touched her. She felt it press against her lips. "Mmmmm," she said. She looked at him, he was staring down at her. There was no turning back now. Her eyes were as wide as she could open them. He had both hands on her thighs as he looked down at her. His cock, his hard cock pushing against her lips. And he was smiling. She felt his breath on her face.</p> <p>"Let me taste you, too," he said. As soon as she turned her head, her mouth opened and he slid his cock between her lips. She felt it pushing against her throat and then she felt him pushing through her lips. She turned her head toward him and he was there. She felt the head of his cock bump against her teeth and then slide in. she looked into his eyes, saw the expression of lust and determination in his face. "Yes," she almost hissed. She looked up at him as he held her in his arms. He pushed more of his cock into her mouth and she almost gagged until he pulled it free of her mouth and held it there between her lips.</p> <p>She felt his hands come around her hips and come to her breasts. He slid one of her bra straps off and held the cup to her chest. They stared at each other. Her nipples were erect and he cupped a breast in both hands and rolled them around. He looked at her face as he held her in his arms. She felt herself becoming aroused again, his naked body next to her and her breastsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
