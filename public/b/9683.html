She was wearing a dark blue dress cut just below her crotch and short sleeves but with a pretty plunging neckline, the top one very low-cut and not at all see-through.</p> <p>"You remember that story about how you found out how pretty I looked all summer long at the beach?"</p> <p>"Of course! I told you!" I agreed but still had an uneasy feeling. "I do remember it. I liked it then!"</p> <p>The next day, they decided to go to the beach as usual. That evening, they went to dinner alone and had dinner. They were talking and laughing like old friends. It was pretty nice, actually.</p> <p>When they were about halfway through their meal, I asked, "Any plans for the wedding, honey?" It had begun. I was afraid that my best friend would be angry.</p> <p>She just said "I'm not much of a party goer."</p> <p>"Well, at least it's no wedding yet!"</p> <p>"Oh, no. It's not that. The day isn't a big time for our planning, but for us it has possibilities. It is a lot of work. We just need time."</p> <p>I was surprised. I knew that she was joking but still, I wasn't sure. I guess that I hadn't been paying attention because she started to tell me more about how much fun she and her husband had been going on in their home town over the years. She had married him because they wanted to help his family for a long time that he couldn't afford and they wanted to get married. In the past, she had tried to convince them to go to work in their town but they had refused and would have quit, so she had decided to stay.</p> <p>She had been dating some other guy and had decided to stay too. That is why she was talking about this, I thought.</p> <p>We had agreed that we would just go on the phone and take the day off and go out for dinner, so she made a suggestion. "I want to talk to your friend and get to know her better," she said. "She is about two years older than you and has very beautiful legs. I want to try out being with you to get a feel for how much she wants to do with you and you might decide she shouldn't be interested in women!"</p> <p>The conversation continued in that way for the next few minutes, till we had finished our meal. We said our good-byes and said our goodbyes again and she said, "Well that went better than I could have imagined."</p> <p>That evening, they said good-bye and we sat around the table for the rest of the evening. I was really starting to like her, and she seemed genuinely happy about that.</p> <p>The next day, they got very nice presents and gifts and things I couldn't bring home, so I said good-bye to them and we went our separate ways that night, at last. They were great friends.</p> <p>The next two weeks passed without any major event or event.</p> <p>She didn't tell me anything about the wedding, though. She just kept telling me all about it. She said that it was something that she felt that she wanted to do. The next week, I got a package with a card and it said, "Meet me at my house for a drink. Take what you think you will need and then give me your best friend."</p> <p>A few days later the package had arrived. It had a picture of an incredibly beautiful blonde, from above. She looked incredible. She had on this very tight little dress that showed off her curves perfectly. The back showed off the top of her butt but also her butt was so tight that if you got close enough to it, you could just see the top of her butt crack. Her panties were very tight and were clearly outlined against her ass but her panties were also very see-through. The next picture had me looking closely at her pussy in the panties but even though it was the pink color of her panties, there was a dark triangle between her legs so that you could see all the pink lips. She gave me the look of a horny school teacher, and I said something about wanting to eat her pussy, but she laughed and said that it would be a lot more fun to get me to do it. I got a big kick out of her saying what was mine, and it had certainly not been wasted.</p> <p>I showed up to her house a half hour later and just as I was about to open the box but before I got out, she turned and said just to say good-bye, and she had already been so into her little game that she had forgotten. She pulled off her panties, just as sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
