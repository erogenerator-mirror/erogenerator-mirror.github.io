Why not with you?”</p> <p>“I’m looking to get more comfortable.”</p> <p>“You’ll have to work out,” she stated emphatically. “You’re not coming to any gym. Take it easy while you see what you can do.”</p> <p>He had to admit, it made him feel good, to be able to keep this in his life and to enjoy it. Her advice and concern about their life together made his whole life seem like a new and exciting adventure. He knew he had been fortunate tonight but he never expected things to escalate far from his expectations. He felt like she was making him feel important. It wasn’t lost on him that she was beautiful.</p> <p>A week later, the day of the pool party had arrived. He remembered the events in detail. He remembered sitting in his truck driving out of there to go swimming. He remembered all manner of different swimming events with different people, in the car. He remembers having to walk with his hand over his eye to get out. He remembered having to make a couple of small adjustments in the mirrors to catch something. He remembers the people from the school who attended the party and his friend Jim who was there. He remembered some of the women who arrived together wearing t-shirts and bathing suits. He remembers one lady saying she would have a fit and then a look around. He remembers all sorts of small talk, like he had done with his last girlfriend. He remembered the first time he looked at some of the girls his own age and felt like he had done something good. He remembered some of the guys saying, “Hey, take her, take her, don’t you dare look at her all.” Well that was how it ended up. Jim and his friend Dave would get into the back yard all the time. When they did, they would make fun of the woman's body and make wild, crude comments.</p> <p>When he got it, he and the other men were just as much a part of the fun he and his buddies did. He had even been a part of the joke around the pool. As he had seen so many times before, he loved the attention he was getting. He did have a little bit of trouble seeing all of the faces the other guys got. There was always a crowd and usually it ended with him grabbing hold of one of the girls or two that were near the entrance or just staring at one of the guys sitting around.</p> <p>Now that he was home and his new place was ready, his day began the same way. He had to try not to look like he was having a good time of it. Most of the girls left just to go see their friends. The guys he had hooked up with didn’t seem too interested in him. The group he was in was a group. Maybe they would be friends. They didn’t seem to have a lot of time to socialize with the other girls. That seemed kind of odd. They went on out after all. As for the group he seemed to have a thing of the group thing. Sure there were a few people he and his other guys had screwed or tried to screw, it wasn’t like they weren’t interested in getting into his pants. But it seemed like it would be all he had. All he really wanted is some pussy and a chance to go out and have a good time. And, he was sure that if it wasn’t for his friendship with his buddies it wouldn’t be this way. He did try to feel comfortable around all four of his friends, but he was surprised to feel a little like he was cheating on his wife. The group thing always seemed to work the same way.</p> <p>The day finally came and things went off to school. He got his classes out. This was going to be fun. There was no more waiting in the classroom for him as his mom was already doing her lunch break. He got up early and started his day, getting ready. He dressed in a casual jean and t-shirt and went to work. He really liked to work out. His body was a little chubbier than in last weekend, but he still looked great. After going for an hour I went to bed. When I got home I stripped down and climbed into bed with my girlfriend.
