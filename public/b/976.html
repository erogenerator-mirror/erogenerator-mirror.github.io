I leaned over, put my hands on the back of her head and started working my dick between her soft lips, fucking her face. Her lips were hot, so inviting. The tip of my dick bumped right at the back of her throat. "No," she said, holding on to the shaft with her hand, her throat pulsing around my big cock. I pulled my hips back and then pushed further, forcing the entire thing down her throat. "Ummmm," she groaned through her tightly clenched lips again. I felt her throat clench and then loosen around my shaft. Her tongue licked along the underside as I pulled my dick out. "Fuck," I moaned when I finally released her head. I looked down at her face, dripping with my come and saliva. She looked up at me, eyes glazed. "I can't believe I just did that."</p> <p>"I know," I admitted. "It's all I could think about all morning." With another smile, I lifted her body off the couch and threw her on the couch, on her stomach and lifted her legs to the couch. I walked around the chair and sat down, my dick pointing at her pussy.</p> <p>"You have a gorgeous pussy, baby," I said, licking through it and looking back at it. She groaned, "Damn. You're hard again already? I want it hard again." I lowered myself down to her. I could smell her arousal. Her pussy was already swollen and hot and wet. She grabbed my dick and aimed it at the opening. I felt her muscles bunch and squeeze it as I slowly pushed it into her.</p> <p>"Ohhh. Ohhh, yes," she said. I slowly pushed. I felt her vagina expand slightly as I worked the first two inches in. My cock pressed against her cervix with each push. Her eyes went wide and then shut again. "You okay?" she asked. After what seemed a timeless moment of hesitation, "You okay?" I was so turned on that I almost wanted to say yes. I felt my cock head stretch her pussy open more, just leaving it in. "Fuuuuck yeah," she moaned. Slowly I worked the remaining inches in, and out, then back in, in and out. I was getting close. I started to fuck her with long strokes at a slow pace. She looked so beautiful on the couch like that. It made me realize how beautiful she actually looked at that moment. I reached out and took a handful of her hair in my hand, gently guiding it up and away from her neck. I wanted to keep it there, holding on to her, not touching her. She looked so beautiful as she lay there. "Is this what you wanted, huh?" I said to her. "Oh yeah," she replied. I kissed her back. It made her all the more gorgeous, I think. I kept my hands on her hips. "This feels good," I said.</p> <p>"You're so big," she said, still working her pussy up and down with her hands. Again, she was making it all the more sexy to hear. I pulled my cock out, making her gasp. I leaned over and gave her a quick kiss, and then stepped back, my dick dripping with her juice on the armrest, "Come on." We both got off the back of the couch and ran towards the bedroom.</p> <p>Once inside, I threw her onto the bed. Her eyes widened when she saw what I was doing. "No. You're not allowed to undress me yet," I said. I crawled forward until my head was between her legs. I spread her again, this time looking at her pussy. "There, that doesn't bother you, does it? You have a beautiful pussy," I continued. I looked her in her eyes again. Then I started licking slowly around her pussy lips. Her lips were already hard. Her skin was salty, like a mix of perspiration and her own come. The flavor of a woman's arousal was all over her face and in her mouth. I started tongue fucking her again. When I felt like I was getting close, I slipped one finger inside her and felt for her g-spot. I knew how to push it. It was hard to feel for myself, but I found that I could just slide one finger out of her, as it was still slippery from licking her, and replace it with my cock. "Yes," she said, "Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh my god." I felt her muscles grabbing my finger, then her pelvis lifting it up and down against my tongue. Her clit was swollen. It was swollen too. "Oh my god," she repeated, repeating over and over again. I could feel her body quiveringâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
