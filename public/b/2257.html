"Maybe you can help me find my clothes."</p> <p>I was silent for a moment, trying to catch my breath. "Help me find my clothes," the words echoed through me, almost as if they were being whispered in my ears.</p> <p>When I finally stood up she pulled me back towards her. I grabbed her hips and brought one of her legs up to rest on my shoulder, letting it drop off mine as they embraced, her head pressed against my chest as they rubbed their bodies against each other.</p> <p>As our breasts pressed together I moved one of my hands to her hip, moving her over to lay her down in the bed, and pulling her towards herself so that I could lay beside her. She turned her head to kiss my chest before sliding down my body, her mouth on my cock as her lips slid down my crotch to wrap around the head of my cock. She kissed the base to the head, her tongue sliding along the underside of my shaft, before she took my balls into her mouth, sucking them gently and running her tongue up the underside of that shaft.</p> <p>"Baby, I can't wait any longer."</p> <p>She squeezed my balls in her fingers, her head bobbing gently up and down as her mouth slid down my shaft. I could feel my cock throbbing within her mouth as her nose bumped up against me. I leaned against her as she slid my cock back into her mouth, my back arching until it was on the brink. Just before I grabbed her hair I felt that familiar pressure inside of me. And it got even stronger as her mouth made up for the last half hour of this trip. My entire body went red as her tongue swirled around the head of my cock, her hands sliding up from my balls to rub the shaft up and down with quick up and down motions, her little fists brushing against the underside of myself as she went faster.</p> <p>Her mouth never stopped bobbing, the head coming up only far enough to cover the head of my cock in saliva as her tongue teased there way back down the long shaft. My whole body was quivering as her tongue kept playing with the head, sending shivers through my body as I felt the end of my cock swell within her mouth. I felt her mouth tightening once again around my cock as she started to swallow; her mouth working over my head before her mouth would open and she would suck the head back into her as her mouth filled with spit. My hips lifted up off the bed as her tongue and hands worked over me, moving from my balls toward the head of my cock as her hand massaged the spongy shaft. I reached for her hair as I felt the first spurt hit the back of her throat; the cum exploding against the roof of her mouth as she did everything to try to keep up and swallow my whole load. I couldn't believe how wet her entire body was as she swallowed it, my cock still swollen as I could feel the contractions through my body as I came down the long road.</p> <p>As my orgasm subsided she pulled her mouth off of my cock, my cock glistening with her spit as she ran up my stomach, kissing me on the lips before she climbed off of the bed.</p> <p>"That was amazing," she told me as she ran a finger along the head of her cock. "I feel like a pro."</p> <p>I smiled up at her and pulled her to me for a kiss. We pulled away from each other, her head still pressed against my chest as my finger started tracing the outline of her lips. "I don't know what came over me," I told her. "I thought this would be really sweet once I got your shirt off."</p> <p>"And I thought this would be a very good thing," she replied before we broke from our kissing. "Now get into bed before your parents wake up."</p> <p>As we turned over I ran my hands slowly towards my dick as she did the same. Her eyes widened when she saw the head and her smile disappeared.</p> <p>"So what did you think?" I asked her as I slowly moved my hand down the side of her body.</p> <p>"I can't wait to see you on time, but since we just won the final game tomorrow it will be only Friday," she said lightly as my hand made its way down her body. "As far as my dad is concerned this is the last game."</p> <p>"Well, at least we have a free weekend."</p> <p>Her eyes flicked to my crotch and she smiled. "I'm sure we can figure something out. It's all part of the weekend fun."</p> <p>With that she rolled onto her back spreading her legs and beckoning our hips closer to hers. I moved one of my hands down her body and her hip, her fingers tracing soft circles on me as she sat upright onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
