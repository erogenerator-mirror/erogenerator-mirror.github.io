She asked.</p> <p>"I didn't say anything about her. I told her that I hadn't said anything about... what she had been doing. So she asked me if... well... I told you I wasn't sure what the answer to that is."</p> <p>"Did you say anything to her about how... how well endowed you were?" She asked curiously.</p> <p>"Well, I was always trying to tell her about... her boobs, especially how big they were... And... how soft and warm they were. But then I had to try and guess... which ones were the most impressive. She had to see if... "</p> <p>She suddenly stopped, blushing as she looked down, then suddenly blushed again as she saw that I was staring at her... she was blushing, and her eyes blazed with excitement as she stared at me. Suddenly, I felt aroused, but I didn't say anything.</p> <p>"Is... is there something else you need?" She asked.</p> <p>"There is," I replied.</p> <p>"But..."</p> <p>I didn't say anything, not for some reason, but for some reason, it seemed important to speak. So I asked her to come over and lean over against the wall of the bath and touch her tits. She had to turn away to do that because she didn't think I could be angry, if I ever did.</p> <p>Well, after a long time, it came to pass, I got up and walked by her, and sat on the bath, with a strong hand.</p> <p>"You know... there was no one else's mom... you know what I mean? Well, there is one girl's mom. And I found the name on her dress. It looked real, even though at different times when it was not... I'm sure she is older, but she was still my mother and she was my friend in all things..."</p> <p>I saw something flash in her eyes and then she looked away from me and tried to hold the other girls breasts, but of course they were completely different. She tried to put them into each other's hands, but even with that, she was not very strong, not strong enough. I couldn't understand my own reaction. I decided to get the courage to speak up.</p> <p>"Mom, tell me a story about her."</p> <p>"Of course, honey... I'll tell you anything anyway. It's just... I don't want you to be afraid."</p> <p>"I won't go out and get drunk either... I don't want the girls in my class to laugh at me... so... "</p> <p>"Good! So you can do what you want... "</p> <p>"I want to fuck you, Mom... But..."</p> <p>"Yes! Yes, do what you want! We are very good friends, sweetheart!"</p> <p>I was very tempted to say no, but then my conscience, which had been a bad thing for a long time, saw that I really wanted to show her how much love I love her and to please her as she pleases me. I decided to tell her how much I love her and will please her with my life, while I still remember my feelings in her past. I took one more thought away.</p> <p>"Can I make love to your body, Mom?" I asked, as if this was a question that can be asked of a child.</p> <p>"Yes! I love you!" she said, a tear forming in her eyes, as I saw her face turn red with emotion.</p> <p>She was blushing, but somehow she had put more confidence in her voice.</p> <p>"Can I touch your vagina?" I asked as innocently and as politely as if I meant it, as if I wanted to show her just how special a woman can be. For some time I just held her, feeling the soft warmth of her body in my hands. All these years since the last time I had sex with her, it was only after she had been pregnant with me.</p> <p>She nodded yes. I moved my head around and then slowly moved her hands on my breast. When she was done, I moved my lips to hers, and kissed her, hard and for a long moment. Then, while we were still standing, I moved my mouth down her body and started to lick her stomach. She moaned and moved her hips a little, but did not push me away. My lips came back to her belly and I kissed around her navel, and kissed under it again, slowly. She moaned again. I pushed on her belly with my hands and the soft fabric of her pajamas made it easier, as to get better access for my kisses.
