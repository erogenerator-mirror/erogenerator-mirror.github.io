Each forward push felt so good... her hand found its way to her cunt again and she began to gently rub herself, spreading the juice she could feel from her slit to her fingers. Soon she slipped two fingers insider her, moving them in and out fast and rubbing at the very tip of her finger, stroking her clit each and every pass... she could feel the walls of her little pussy contracting as she fingered herself, her pussy spasming with each pull. She could feel the orgasm building in her belly... her fingers were pumping in and out in quick short bursts, her muscles tightening up on her own fingers. She was going to come soon... But one of her hands wasn't enough... she needed the other one... she brought it up to her face and felt how wet her hand was, taking the lubrication with it.

Slowly she moved her head down and licked the juices from her palm, smiling that this was almost over... she turned around and licked her palm of cum, smiling as she knew her job was soon to be very, very done.</p> <p>She got up and dressed, her pussy still throbbing from her orgasms and the pressure in her thighs. She was pleased with her handiwork and hoped this would be a quickie. She walked out of the room and got her bag and walked over to the bed, finding her bag of clothes and slipping a small pair of panties under them. She closed the door behind her and walked out, feeling her tits brush against the cool air as she walked. She knew she was going to make an early start. She closed the door and walked to her car, finding it was only about a block away.</p> <p>She sat on her car for a few more minutes, enjoying the feeling of her panties... remembering the feel in her pussy she had been through this evening. It had been really good... even if now it was a little weird to think about itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
