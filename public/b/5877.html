We were no longer going to be able to communicate. I had been more concerned about finding something to do with Jennifer and getting back to a normal life. At first this was more of an issue with us than with each other. Now the conversation had become so much more about life as it had been before. She and I talked about how well we were doing now, and how things were between us. She said that we were a lot closer than we ever had been before.</p> <p>"I am so happy for you," she said. "I'm really happy for you, too. I don't know how we can ever manage to keep it this way. You're going to need it when we start having a baby. It is too complicated."</p> <p>"But it will be different when you start," I said.</p> <p>"Oh yes," she said, "I've decided that now is the right time. Please let it be different just the same. What do you think?"</p> <p>We kissed and then I asked, "Jennifer, I really want to tell Brian now. That I have been in love with him all my life. I want to tell him before we are married." I was really nervous. I didn't want anything that she could say that was going to spoil our sex life. Then I realized that there was nothing going to make us stay that way.</p> <p>"I'm not your bride," she said. "I am not Brian. I'm not having sex with him."</p> <p>"But I love you," I told her, knowing that what she wanted now would be different with her than it had been with me.</p> <p>"And I love you, too," she said and kissed me. I kissed her back, and for the first time in years I felt truly happy. I could not imagine having loved this person for the rest of my life! I was completely confused. I had never thought of Jennifer in a sexual way before. I guess she got all I could handle from our discussion of sex. This was all new to me, but I wanted to have more with my lover.</p> <p>We kissed again this time, and then I said, "I'm going to take my turn and do something with you. I don't want you thinking that I didn't do anything sexual and just because I had enjoyed what you did. I would love to do the same for you as Brian did for me so I will do something with you instead of just telling you this." We kissed again and this time I could feel Jennifer's breath on my body.</p> <p>"I want us to do this together," she said. "I know it sounds silly, but I have never been with other men. I have never even been with another man before. I'm not ready. But that's the way it is and we are ready. As long as it starts something new for us."</p> <p>"That's so sweet of you," I said and kissed her again.</p> <p>"I was hoping you'd want to do that," she said, and moved herself down to kiss me. "I couldn't help but think of that man and I have never been able to be intimate with another man." We kissed again, and then we broke apart.</p> <p>"Let's try again," Jennifer said and started rubbing her body again. "Let's go to bed."</p> <p>I watched in total amazement as Jennifer climbed onto the bed and turned toward me. Then she got up and got in beside me and sat down on the edge of the bed. She grabbed my hand and pulled me down to join her. She kissed me and then looked at me and asked, "Do you want to do that again? You can have me right now."</p> <p>"Yes," I said.</p> <p>"I can't," she said. "I can't."</p> <p>Jennifer rolled onto her back and spread her legs apart. "Come here, Darling," she said and took my hand and put it on top of her vagina. I ran my hand around her lips, feeling for her clit, and found it. I could smell her excitement. I ran my finger down and over her lips and saw that she was wet.</p> <p>"I'm ready," she said and moved so that my finger was between her lips. "I want you in me. Do me." I pushed my finger further and found her clit. "I can't let you do this with Brian," she said softly.</p> <p>"I've never done it before," I said. How could I? And I certainly did not want her to tell me that. I had to keep it to myself. I did not want it to be an accident, either.</p> <p>"Do it with me," she encouraged. "I want you to feel how tight I am.
