"I have wanted to do that for so long, you know."</p> <p>"I know but that's not the point. I want to make us more comfortable."</p> <p>"That would be nice," Dan said.</p> <p>And she giggled.</p> <p>"How about the coffee?" she asked as she rose to her feet. Dan sat back as she went to take the seat next to him. "How about a cup of coffee? This isn't a hotel room but just an excellent retreat for two couples."</p> <p>Dan just gaped at her and looked from her to his glass of coffee to her.</p> <p>"A coffee? That sounds wonderful!" He stood up, took his glass of coffee from her, brought it toward her. She took a sip and smiled. "Very nice, just a touch of sugar. And a few more of those pills that I gave you yesterday. Are they effective?"</p> <p>"No, they don't," she said with a look of disgust. "They work, but they are dangerous to the brain. Do that more often."</p> <p>"I'll think about it." He sat back on the chair and sipped his coffee watching her.</p> <p>"That's a good idea. Do some more and the pills will kick in so I can start drinking again."</p> <p>"You don't need to do that," Dan said, smiling. "Just think about that. You were so concerned about being with me earlier today, I'm pretty sure that you didn't have that much to drink."</p> <p>"That's true. I had my body just reacting."</p> <p>Dan looked at her again, "So, the sex and the love is good?"</p> <p>"Yeah. It's good. Really, really good. Actually it's pretty good, isn't it?" she said laughing. "I just didn't know about sex until well into my honeymoon. Now I understand why you like to be with me sometimes."</p> <p>"Don't worry," he said. "A little something called the drug called oxytocin is just what it's called. It's kind of like your love, though of course you have to be a little more careful. I just can't have you becoming attached to me."</p> <p>"A little and it's fun, I guess." She reached up to brush the corner of her mouth with her thumb, putting her finger there.</p> <p>"But I can't make a good girlfriend after that."</p> <p>"It would be fun to have a strong boyfriend who wasn't attached to you forever."</p> <p>Dan sighed. The woman had really just been a lovely woman. Maybe he would be able to go to work this morning and let her be with him for lunch? There was just no sense in putting that right now. "That shouldn't be a problem. I'm going to be so tired when I get home."</p> <p>"Of course you won't," she said. "It shouldn't be a problem. I've got my own room tonight. It's just around the corner from the hotel. Come on. We don't have to be late."</p> <p>She squeezed her arms around him and kissed him on the cheek. Dan kissed her on the lips but his eyes were locked to hers. "I'll be so lucky you're really happy," he whispered.</p> <p>"I am, especially when I'm with you," she replied, looking up at the ceiling.</p> <p>Dan returned her stare. "Me too."</p> <p>"Well, let's have a nice dinner when we get home. I have something to tell you, too."</p> <p>"That sounds nice," he said.</p> <p>"But you aren't quite right on that score."</p> <p>"Do you really think I should think about it?" Dan grinned. "I'm just not sure that I could be that man enough to make a good girlfriend."</p> <p>"Not if we don't have something else, at least not yet."</p> <p>Dan grinned and hugged her. "What's that about?" he asked.</p> <p>"My ex, the woman who helped me with my first date last week, doesn't like me at all."</p> <p>Dan laughed, "Are you sure that I'm OK with this?"</p> <p>"Probably, Dan. You seem like a reasonable guy."</p> <p>"But you're pretty darn nice yourself."</p> <p>"Oh yes."</p> <p>"And you are a very lucky guy," she whispered, kissing his neck.</p> <p>They shared quiet smiles and then Dan stood. "OK, I'll take a shower now. Just take your shoes off and throw anything away in the corner. I just want you toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
