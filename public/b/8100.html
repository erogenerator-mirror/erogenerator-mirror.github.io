The living room area on the other side was spotless now and I didn't believe I could see. Then I went back and sat down. There was nothing to do but relax and to think over the last few years, and what good would it do?</p> <p>Chapter 5</p> <p>When I stepped in to the living room I saw that it was very dark! What if Tim's mom and dad were up? What if I had a key? What if all this was just a misunderstanding? I thought that what we were doing was wrong, but it seemed to have been for someone else's pleasure, and then the two of us would be alone.</p> <p>I felt guilty and ashamed at this all. Why would I feel guilty when my own son and wife were in my home with their family? We've had one-sided relationships for years. Sure some things, like last week were a bit more than best friends, but it was nothing more than a friendly and friendly conversation and if I hadn't already had those feelings by now I would never have thought of even trying it again.</p> <p>I looked out the window and saw that it was dark again. Then I saw someone moving around and the sound got louder so I followed it too. I stood at the end of my lounge and listened, which only made me giggle a little, the way the sound seemed to echo in the large room. Then the door opened and I knew what I had to do next, and I knew I must not make the slightest sound. But this way I knew that I must not just go and get that old dress that I just packed, but that I must go and wear it for Tim, and wear the one that I saw him wearing the first time I saw him out there. I put it on; it slid in smoothly and I didn't bother with underwear, just as my brother always did on visits to see me when he had school. I was sure it would do that; I was sure they were going to fuck anyway, didn't they? I had just seen my brother's dick, I don't have that kind of dick and I guess I must be in love.</p> <p>When I walked into the living room I was relieved to see the TV on though, and the glow from it made me even more nervous. The sight of my new dress made me tremble, and as I looked and heard it come across my bedroom floor it was obvious that it was something that Tim would never wear again. I could feel my cheeks burning red with embarrassment as I waited.</p> <p>When the lights went on I thought Tim must have gone upstairs by now when he looked up towards the room. Then I saw him walk from behind the door. As he turned to face me he seemed to start to open the door again, before he turned back around and I knew that the rest of his world had just become even more indistinct. "Come on, put the dress on, we're almost home, do it," I had no idea that he would be coming here.</p> <p>Just as suddenly they were moving out of my room again, and by then the first of all the dresses left me a little unsettled. Tim knew that I knew what to wear, and that it was OK for him to do the same thing now that he had come here. I could feel my cheeks burning with shame as I waited for him, his eyes as cold as cold ice with a look of worry on his face.</p> <p>Then I heard footsteps in the hallway, and when I thought everything was OK, I moved down to the corner of my room and sat down, my heart beating hard in my chest. I heard footsteps behind me and then the door opened and Tim stepped back into the hallway. It was a couple of minutes' walk, but they didn't speak, and I felt very uncomfortable in his presence.</p> <p>I heard the door close, the lock click behind me and then I heard the lock being removed, Tim's breath catching against my ear in a series of huffs I couldn't quite make out. When the door opened again I could feel my cheeks burning with embarrassment, as my own hands were now in the pockets of my new dress, a deep flush of arousal creeping over me, and I could feel my own cock growing against the outside of the dress of my clothes, my own breath coming in short panting breaths. I could feel the tautness of my clothes and the heat of my skin as the dress slid down my arms and fell to the floor. The skirt was a bit shorter than the dress and had a wide hem. I didn't know what it was that Tim had on or what it was that I was wearing and I wondered to myself if it would be okay. But instead of going ahead and giving up I just sat there, frozen in time, unable to move at all.</p> <p>After a moment or twoâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
