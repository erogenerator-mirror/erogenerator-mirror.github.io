It's my day to write...the story and a lot of the technical detail."</p> <p>"Oh, so you have a whole world in front of you."</p> <p>"I think I do. I'm always going back when I was a writer. I have a lot on my mind since the beginning, but I'm sure you will be able to help keep me busy. When is the final review?"</p> <p>For the rest of the week I tried to keep busy. I did what I could in this field and worked my way down the corporate ladder. It was a lot of work and I thought I still had a job of it, but I wanted to see how the company lived up to the expectations. I finally came home Thursday night and went to bed early.</p> <p>I have no idea how much time it will take to review the next section of the reviews, but I did manage to review the final sections of the quarterly review. I got into my desk and made my presentation, and just before I left early the next morning all my lights went out and I had a hard time writing the report. In the rush, I forgot that I had the phone with me to work with. I made up as much as I thought I could and just gave it to my folks for emergencies. They didn't hear it but I could tell my dad would be in a panic and he probably would be pissed that I would leave his property and his property to others. That would also be a big liability for my parents, but they were very grateful for my help as the only one doing all this for me.</p> <p>It was still a long week, and when I got back home I started the review process. It took all day to work through each section so that I had the time to make my report. One thing I would never do in my job before was spend that amount of time running through my comments. I just did it the way I would like to when I got the job.</p> <p>I am guessing we can make a lot of money out of this job so I am going to get the rest of the review finished by Tuesday evening. I was wondering about this when I went down the stairs. My father was standing by the checkbook at that time and looked up and saw me standing there.</p> <p>"Hello, Daddy."</p> <p>"Mmmmm, you're home early," I smiled. My eyes were wide with excitement as I approached him. Even though I was a married woman, I had been working hard all day to complete the review of my story. Dad gave me his patented smile as we shook hands.</p> <p>The whole time I thought about what I would or could do next, and I was a little afraid to get started today. I couldn't have possibly imagined that I would ever live through that ordeal and just sit back and just wait. It seemed like it was going to be a long work day.</p> <p>Dad was very attentive to my review. He brought me to the end of the review, but he never tried to take me back from my conclusion. I got down on my hands and knees sucking his cock, and while that was going on his hands reached around to the back of my head and made a mental adjustment just enough for me to reach up and massage his balls. Dad groaned at the contact and continued to rub my head and neck. Before I knew it, he was thrusting up and into my mouth as his hips started slapping against the backs of my shoulders causing a vibration to run through the small cabin.</p> <p></p> <p>When he was done and had gotten to his knees I was able to reach up and grip his balls and then pull them down into my mouth hard enough to give him an extra thrill. After a few minutes of this I leaned down to him and gave him his reward. He groaned and I knew he was ready to cum. I let my head drop down and I sucked slowly on him until he finally pulled out of my mouth. My father groaned and I licked my lips to finish my task.</p> <p>I had never tasted my father's cum before and I was almost overwhelmed with the feeling as I brought him to the brink again and again. My own cock would soon follow with a large quantity so I needed him to cum when he felt ready to explode. I started by licking the tip of his cock and tasting the pre-cum mixed with my own saliva. I used my tongue as a lubricant and used my mouth as a cock to stroke him and take the remaining spurts in. When I had finished sucking him for awhile he pulled forward so that his weight was against my head. I looked up at him, our eyes meeting and seeing for the first time how good my effort was having him aroused.</p> <p>I lowered myself back onto the bed, my hands claspâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
