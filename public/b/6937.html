He asked.</p> <p>"What do you think?"</p> <p>"I don't really know...the house is pretty...a whole other story."</p> <p>"I've seen better." she said as she held the door open.</p> <p>"Well I don't want to be seen out of the house, but...." He started before he finished.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Well, you know how you are my boss now? Well I guess I'll have to get started here."</p> <p>"So you've been having sex here?" He asked.</p> <p>"You remember that girl at the club?"</p> <p>"I sure did. She was a good looking lady."</p> <p>"Oh, ok." He said.</p> <p>"No, that's not what I've been doing right now."</p> <p>"You've been fucking her? That's strange," he said.</p> <p>"No...that's not what I mean."</p> <p>"Then why you were fucking her?"</p> <p>"Oh! Well, this is hard to explain. I guess I'm just going to have to start by cleaning this place up and cleaning the house myself."</p> <p>"Ok," she smiled. "I guess I'll take care of my business right now that was quite some cleaning," she said as she reached down and rubbed her thighs together.</p> <p>"Oh, and I'll do my business here," he said.</p> <p>"That's great!" she smiled.</p> <p>"You are a beautiful woman. I can't believe you're married to a beautiful woman."</p> <p>"I'm not married! It's just that..... You know...."</p> <p>"But we've been having phone sex all weekend you know."</p> <p>"Yeah...."</p> <p>"Well, I'm not saying what we do has to stop anytime soon," she laughed. "But I am kind of curious."</p> <p>"I can handle that," he said as he came around to her door.</p> <p>"Oh, I feel sorta funny asking you like this. Do you have any idea what sort of a thing they do?"</p> <p>"What kind of a thing?"</p> <p>"Well, when you were doing sex....Well, one of them might have one of those vibrators on while they were fucking......and I'll tell you something. I liked it when they went from fucking me to fucking me.....well, when I was fucking you I started to go a little crazy. I would try to keep them in a daze at first, but I got hot and I started thinking about what it would be like to be with someone....and to have sex.... with someone who I might not know."</p> <p>"So what else might you want to know?"</p> <p>"How do you know that woman that I was with before?" he asked.</p> <p>"I think she fucked me the first time I saw her. She must have been in the same club with you?"</p> <p>"My friend was. The woman that I told you about was my boss. She was a bit older then I was anyway...."</p> <p>"Well, you're right. Well, she and I got together a couple times and we did some really good things with those vibrators. She was pretty good too."</p> <p>"You mean......" He started to ask.</p> <p>"Yes..... She had a big one. And it was way bigger then mine."</p> <p>"Well, you can take care of hers too if you want." he laughed.</p> <p>"Well, it's not just a vibrator. This woman.....She.....I don't know...."</p> <p>"We might help with that."</p> <p>"You bet we will" he said with a smile.</p> <p>"I'm going to get started cleaning this place," she said. "But, if you think you could help me, I'll ask my husband."</p> <p>"OK," he smiled. "I'll do what I can."</p> <p>"I hope I can......" He started.</p> <p>"You know you can," she said. "I'll have a drink....with you."</p> <p>"That sounds like fun. And if I could, I would come home with you so you can fuck me right off," he smiled.</p> <p>"Oh yes," she smiled. "Now lets get cleaned up." she said and she opened the door and walked over to her desk.</p> <p>She started to get up and go to the sink, but he stopped her.</p> <p>"Wait," he said. "I think we need to shower first," he whispered.</p> <p>"Of course I will......what was it that woman did to you?" she asked, smiling.</p> <p>"Her name's Monica...."</p> <p>"Who's Monica?"</p> <p>"The stripper....". he said as he smiledâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
