They had become close, even though he was not my father. I remember that my mother was never more than a step or two behind Mom even when we moved in, but I never really thought of them as anything, even though they were certainly close. Now that they were old enough to be my mother and even as old as my mother was, they still made me feel attractive in a way, and that is what it was, no mistaking what turned me on the most.</p> <p>"You're such a beautiful woman, Mrs. Thomas."</p> <p>He leaned her shoulders down to me, his lips meeting mine. It was just the moment we shared. His lips left mine, brushing kisses on my lips as the air escaped me, and just felt like there was electricity flowing between us. I pulled back slightly as his lips left mine, but he pushed on me with his finger to take my lips once again.</p> <p>I moaned into his mouth, and felt a little wetness in there, so I knew that he felt it. He reached into the pocket of his jacket, and pulled out a key ring, and slipped it into the loop on the back of my blouse.</p> <p>I pulled up my arms, and put them behind my head, leaning back against the mirror as his body pushed against mine, feeling his man tool pushing against me again. He pulled off of me, pulling his shirt over his head as he came to the door. He slipped the ring back into the pocket, and grabbed my shoulders as he opened the door, taking me in his arms as he led me out to the sidewalk. It was cold at first as we walked, and he had put on a ski mask, making it difficult for anyone else to see us.</p> <p>"Thank you, Mrs. Thomas," he said, as we pulled into the parking lot at the edge of town. "You're looking beautiful this evening, my dear."</p> <p>"Thank you, sir," was all I could say, feeling my breasts press against him with every step.</p> <p>"I'm not so sure it would work tonight, Mr. Thomas," he said as we got out of the cab. "I'm afraid you're going to have to buy more food, so you might not appreciate the difference."</p> <p>"It'll still be cold out there," I said. "But I can see where you fit inside of me. I wish we could get a cab to my car, sir."</p> <p>"You are most welcome," he said with a chuckle.</p> <p>I was glad that we were in public, as we looked back at the street where we had parked. I noticed several people who were standing and talking outside, and the only one I think I recognized was that guy who ran the stop sign. He was sitting in a car that had his arm around a man I had just met a short time ago. I took my arm out from around the wheel, and he grabbed me around the waist. He pushed me to the seat, and sat in front of me, pulling me up so my back hit the window. With one hand on my knee, he rubbed my thigh until I was wet, which made me move my legs apart slightly. When he pulled away, I was already getting more wet when my lips parted just a little.</p> <p>It was my first time, but for the most part I had been getting enough cock and pussy for the past weeks. My pussy was actually on fire, the muscles of my thighs were contracting around my hand, and I had to brace myself against the mirror behind me, which made it even more difficult for the man sitting next to him. I didn't worry about being able to see him, my only concern was if he saw how wet I felt.</p> <p>He leaned over and started to kiss me, while his other hand went to her skirt. "Shall I pull it off, Mrs. Thomas?"</p> <p>"No," I said, smiling up at him. "I want you to be inside me, in my pussy, not the other way around." I pulled my blouse up for him, revealing my breasts to him as I had my blouse off.</p> <p>"I'm glad to see that you're willing, my dear," he said, pulling his hand out from under her skirt. "We really do need to get a room."</p> <p>He pulled me to my feet, and I immediately went into his bathroom. I quickly washed my mouth and chin and the rest of my body, so as not to have to explain what I had done to him. I turned on him as he looked down at me, and he had a quizzical look on his face.</p> <p>"Don't worry, sir," I said, taking my hand from his lap and putting it on top of his.
