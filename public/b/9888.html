I'm just so proud of you."</p> <p>"I am proud of you," she said as she leaned forward and kissed me. "We've been so busy with the kids, and with the work we've been doing for Daddy, and even more, since last summer. I can't thank you enough for everything."</p> <p>I couldn't even reply. That beautiful, tender young girl was about to make love to me, and the mere thought made me ache.</p> <p>But it wasn't just the feel of her soft lips against my own that I was enjoying that much. I'd never felt anything so good or so right in my entire life. This was the dream, the dream of an adult. I was looking up and seeing her, her beautiful, sweet, angelic face looking into mine, her eyes, her lips, her voice. I felt that love and desire that only a woman can ever feel. She made me feel as good as she made me feel.</p> <p>To say I was breathless was an understatement. My hands slid down her back, to her firm round bottom, where my first thoughts had been to make her wear such tight jeans. My right hand slid to her lower back, where I held her and squeezed her firm warm cheeks.</p> <p>"I know you want me to stop," she whispered, "and I want to, but it's been so long and we should make the most of this. I promise, Baby."</p> <p>And I did. I gently turned her, and lay her back on the pillow, her head on my lap. She didn't say a word, just looked so happy, and so happy. The look of her beautiful face, the sound of her laughing, the feel of her naked body, all of it, all of this was magical. I reached down to her legs, which she lifted, then laid them bare in the middle of the bed. I took both of her hands in mine, and placed them atop my breasts. As she looked at me, then took both breasts in her hands, I placed my right hand on her right hand, and her left on my left, and together, we placed them atop my breasts. With one hand, we held her hands; her hands were soft, her fingers were strong, and so warm, but, I still, there was a tenderness to her touch that made me ache with a feeling of wanting more.</p> <p>It was like the dream, the dream of a sexy girl making love to me. My hands moved on her, touching her as tender, as lovingly as I could. My fingers squeezed, caressed, teased her soft skin. And as my head bent, I brought my mouth to meet her soft lips again. Her hand took mine, and pressed my lips down onto hers. I kissed her just long enough to savor the feel of her lips inside my mouth, to savor the taste of her lips, her kiss. And then the lips were moving down my neck. And when they came to rest against my breasts, I felt the kiss begin anew.</p> <p>It was sweet and tender, a gentle caress against my skin. As her fingers continued their dance of love, I brought her up to me, and kissed her. It went like this for a long time, slow and passionate. It was almost a loving, caressing dance. She seemed to relish my lips on hers, and let it happen all. And after a while I could feel my love for her starting to build. I wasn't sure I could take it any longer. I turned my head to the side, and started to suckle her cheek, her earlobe, and her neck, then her shoulder, my tongue licking the curve where her neck met her upper chest. Her legs, which were resting upon them, were spread and inviting. I moved down further to start on her left breast, only to end up between her breasts again.</p> <p>She reached behind her neck and clasped her hands behind my head. This brought me closer. I raised one of her breasts to my mouth, and started to rub it with the tip of my tongue. She arched her back and let out a small gasp as I sucked on her nipple to the point it was hard and standing straight out. I slid my lips over her breast, and gently bit down, sending electrical ripples throughout her body. The feeling of her skin in my mouth was incredible. I felt as though I could drink her entire breast into my mouth, but I wanted more. I slid my mouth more down, down to her nipple, and started to caress it with the tip of my tongue and lightly nibbling it with my lips.</p> <p>With my mouth covering her breast I began to circle her nipple with my tongue.
