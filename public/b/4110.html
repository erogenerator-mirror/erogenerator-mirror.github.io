It was a cock filling her pussy that was about to be pumped into her. She had never had a cock of any kind but her husband in her body before. It felt good, but not as good as a real penis.</p> <p>He pushed in and out of her, and as the rhythm picked up, he drove his penis in and out of her pussy over and over. She loved it, just as much as she loved the penis she was being penetrated with. The feelings of his hot cock pressing into the inside of her pussy created a tingling. It was a warmth that flowed into her. The sensation was indescribable. She felt like she was getting close to a climax when she felt him pulling out, he flipped over and shoved it back in, but did not stop sliding the penis in and out of her body.</p> <p>She felt him stiffen and heard him moan and then he exploded. He shot load after load into her vagina, filling her up, as though it was her lover's cock not his hands. It felt so warm and wonderful to love him again. She could barely move before he kissed her and pulled out of her.</p> <p>"I'm so tired," she murmured.</p> <p>"You're so sexy," she heard a voice say. "I love you."</p> <p>"You're so beautiful," he added.</p> <p>She sat up and he picked her up, carried her to the edge of the bed, and laid her down, kissing her all the way. They kissed for what seemed like forever. He wanted to be with her forever. But was there anything else?</p> <p>"You're too beautiful to be with a man," he said, pushing her down so that she was lying on the bed. He climbed on the opposite side of her, and they sat there kissing, his cock still buried in her pussy. As they kissed, she felt his penis begin to press against her anus. It felt so good, feeling that he was about to take her ass. It was what her husband did to her, he didn't do it for her.</p> <p>"Are you ready?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes," she whispered.</p> <p>She felt him press forward and slowly the head of his penis slowly penetrated her. He paused, and then began to ease his penis into her. She felt him pushing his way inside her anus until the knob of his cock was against both of her entrances. Then he began to sink the organ into her.</p> <p>Allie gasped as he penetrated and it made her feel so full. This felt different. It felt like someone was fucking her, the sensation of his penis in her ass was almost indescribable. It almost seemed that she was fucking him instead of his own cock.</p> <p>"Oh!" she gasped.</p> <p>He was moving inside her, her anus was being stretched by him. Her pussy was throbbing and she felt his penis slide effortlessly in and out of her. She was in heaven.</p> <p>"Are you ready?" he whispered.</p> <p>She felt himself start to slide more easily, and then felt him bottom out in her rectum. He kissed her and then got on it.</p> <p>There was no pain. He continued to slide in and out until she reached her first orgasm of the night. She began to move her hips against his, rubbing her pussy over his erection. She felt him stiffen and stiffen and then she felt him release his semen into her. It felt as though they both finished the night at the same time.</p> <p>They lay there for a couple of minutes talking as he pulled his penis out of her butt. She had a thought, and felt it running through her mind. "You are so beautiful," she said.</p> <p>"It was not such a beautiful thing to have your lover make love to you like that," he responded. "I couldn't believe how good it felt to have sex with you."</p> <p>She felt him move off of her and then roll on his side. "I love you," he whispered.</p> <p>"You're my best," she said and then she rolled to his side, spooning against him. "I'm never getting tired of you."</p> <p>"I don't know about that," he said, stroking her hair. "I was never going to fuck you again."</p> <p>"Neither was I," she said.</p> <p>"That's very true, but the thought hasn't crossed my mind," he said.</p> <p>"There will always be a part of me that wants to take you here again and do you to me as much as I want," she said. "The other part of me is more curious, more curious than wanting."</p> <p>"What have I gotten myself into?" he thought.
