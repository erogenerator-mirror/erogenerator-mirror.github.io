My daughter has been busy lately ... she should be home by tomorrow."</p> <p>There is no way she could think of when she will be home, but I don't remember it now.</p> <p>"I'll see you tomorrow? I'm sure you have a surprise."</p> <p>Yes, her husband will be home soon."</p> <p>A very different experience than last night. A woman and a man. This woman knows her husband and has no feelings for him. However it isn't like a woman would feel. It's like living and breathing life with a man. At some point he'll realize he should do something with a woman. He'll move on.</p> <p>A woman doesn't like men that much. Not so much as a married woman who enjoys being dominated and humiliated. Some woman would give anything and love anything she's given. Most would be reluctant to relinquish her right to the power of a strong man. A woman who wants to be dominated, humiliated, degraded, used.</p> <p>I look around the room. The room is lit with candles. The table is covered with a rich burgundy cloth. Every one is in a good mood.</p> <p>What is this thing about a good time with a man? That must be happening to me, but not to the man doing the man. I find myself thinking back to the past and wonder what it is like being made to like this woman. If I have the right to be dominated over another woman, I might as well just enjoy myself and take what it feels and doesn't matter.</p> <p>"I'm so glad I met you." I walk to the door.</p> <p>"Of course, we can't get together again. But I've had quite a few of those. I had hoped to get together with you again, but then I was afraid I'd hurt you. You're so beautiful, so special..." She starts to stand. I put my arm around her and turn her around. "You can't hurt anyone."</p> <p>"If you say so." Her lips are warm, soft and inviting. "What brings you here?" She's nervous and a bit apprehensive. The fear of what will happen soon starts to make her feel more desirable and desirable.</p> <p>"It's difficult for sure. I'm not the sort that wants to be forced into something I'd let myself do. I've been married to such a cruel man that I want to be able to be with a woman. I've never given in to the need to be dominated in any way. It's a little too personal for me." "You've never been like that?"</p> <p>"We met when I was in high school. I just never thought of it like that. The fear of making my own choices... the helpless and the submission. I'm used to it and I guess that's why I love to be dominated."</p> <p>Her words are a relief, not just because she's finally realized that I'm not the kind of man that she had imagined and has just had the best time of her life in a sense of having finally accepted what she'd been so desperately searching to get away from. I can't help feeling that she finally realizes what's behind all the things she's been denying herself.</p> <p>"I've felt it yourself." She looks at me and takes a deep breath. "I've always been the kind of woman that wanted to be a woman. To be what you have." Her eyes look up at me. "I never thought of it this way before, but it's what I've always been and I am determined to become the type of woman that is."</p> <p>"I'm glad you told me earlier," I say, "I guess I was a little taken aback by just how much that was true. I really wanted to kiss you, but it would probably have been rude for you to do so before we could even go on this date."</p> <p>"Oh, yes, this is a date and I'm not going to ask you to stop," she tells me. "I am going to go put on a nice shirt and I'll be right back."</p> <p>"You're not going to wear clothes, are you?"</p> <p>"Nope."</p> <p>"You'll come back looking good, sexy and attractive, and not afraid."</p> <p>"I guess." She's flushed, and it makes me wonder if she thinks it was my eyes or my eyes that was making her blush.</p> <p>She returns, carrying a tray with a few glasses of wine. I wonder if she's a little too drunk for her own good. She has a couple of glasses.</p> <p>"Are you ready to move on to some dessert?" she asks, "You need to decide what you're going to do to me, tonight, the next time you're with your family, I suppose."</p> <p>I look at her.
