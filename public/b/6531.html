"Oh, dear girl, are you all right. I wasn't able to get you to come. I'm concerned. Can I keep you this evening?"</p> <p>"But... but... you have to go soon! I can't have you all night!"</p> <p>"I was going to come, but no. I got scared and I won't. I was worried that the food would be left there. We haven't had a chance to pick something, though we had to have a glass of water."</p> <p>"My God, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring you to the island, but I'm not so concerned. I really have no idea what I'm going to do to you."</p> <p>"I don't really care anymore about you. I'm not interested in talking about things that happened. It's just you that I care about, not you."</p> <p>"Well, get out, then. I need to go inside and change, or else I'll be too uncomfortable to be home with you."</p> <p>He smiled at her like a young man.</p> <p>She laughed. "Honey, even worse to leave than just pick up some food. You get to eat with the first aid instructor."</p> <p>Her eyes were filled with tears and when she heard him laughing again she saw his voice, too.</p> <p>He gave her a kiss and she ran over and embraced him. She wrapped her arms around his neck, rubbing his nose with her hand. "Thank you, sir," she said as she hugged him tightly. "I love you so much."</p> <p>"I love you, too." He hugged her back tightly. He couldn't resist a little touch of her skin or ear against his.</p> <p>*** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** ***</p> <p>She was crying. Of course, he was worried about her. He was worried about her. But, well, it was the only thing he was worried about. They were in love with each other. Their relationship was a wonderful and happy one. But, at the same time, she was so scared that she was going to disappear from him.</p> <p>"Please stay, for now," he said and kissed her forehead.</p> <p>"Let's get some rest, then we can take a look around."</p> <p>They were sitting in the middle of the hotel room and he hugged her as he sat beside her, holding her in his lap. They sat looking out the back windows for a while, enjoying their time together.</p> <p>"Where are we going?" she asked.</p> <p>"We were thinking of someplace a bit more private. The beach here is pretty private."</p> <p>"Hmm." She looked at the distant sky and began to wonder if it was a romantic place. "I wonder what to do, what do you have in mind?"</p> <p>He looked at her, smiling. He wasn't smiling at all. "You're a beautiful girl, too, sweetie."</p> <p>"Am I?" she asked. She nodded her head and laughed.</p> <p>"No, you're not. You're beautiful. Just look at you; you remind me of the first time I saw you." She smiled and then closed her eyes. "That's right, right there. We should be good friends, just like that."</p> <p>A feeling of sadness came over her. "This is so silly. I haven't had this chance to go on a vacation since I got here. We've just been here for a few days."</p> <p>"I'm sure they are so busy with work, too. And you haven't been to see them much in a few days?"</p> <p>"Nah, it was just something that we've planned."</p> <p>"That's true," he said, reaching out his hand to her, "I haven't been to see them much since you were here. So, just go to the beach, and take a look around."</p> <p>He touched her arm. "You're going on vacation with me again?"</p> <p>"Yes. I really do love you, and I want to give you my love," she said as she smiled up at him. "I want the same things I've been dreaming of for so long."</p> <p>"Why do you want to give me your love?" he asked. He was getting excited. He could get so excited over a beautiful girl, in his arms. "Because you're really beautiful and I want to make you happy."</p> <p>She smiled at him and he could make her happy at the same time. She was going to make him happy, she thought to herself.</p> <p>*</p> <p>They had gone down to the beach on a beautiful day and she hadn't been on one, but they had all made a little time for it andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
