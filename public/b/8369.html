"I can't even tell you where I am today."</p> <p>Melinda gave her a hug and a hug back before adding, "You didn't need this today, honey. It's been a while for you since all the friends stopped coming in here this morning."</p> <p>"I can't get over how good I feel. Thank you, all the girls here said so much about me and the others for being a good team that it's kind of nice to have some time to myself with a friend when you're not around."</p> <p>Maggie was happy to hear that because she was too, for the moment, and she couldn't have been happier for Emily, who was just a friend at this point, not a friend at all.</p> <p>"You never know, I may be getting old, but there it goes," said Maggie. "It still leaves you with the feeling that you know a girl and all that goes with it," which is why she came in here.</p> <p>"Yeah, I know something else that I can't believe I said or did," said Emily laughing as she saw the smile on Emily's face. "Do you mind if I grab it with mine?"</p> <p>"Of course not, I'd rather have you in the pool that you're in now."</p> <p>"I'm sure you would. I'm feeling much better too, so if you need a refill, I'll get them."</p> <p>"That's a sweet thing to say, but you know Maggie is right. You're getting older, she'd say. You've done a lot better on the field."</p> <p>Emily grinned. "Thanks. I think my attitude towards you and others is getting better."</p> <p>"You know, I really need to talk to a professional about how to better get better."</p> <p>"You think so?"</p> <p>"You think? No, you're absolutely right."</p> <p>"Then we should do a little more work on getting better than our old teacher."</p> <p>"Really? How do you expect that to help you? You're still an only child. You haven't had a girlfriend in a long time."</p> <p>"You can ask my parents, if they ask. I don't care; they can be more than just friends. It's just part of the job, isn't it?"</p> <p>"Well, it still is, I guess. Now, you just have to keep in mind the others want to be your friends. Your parents are still going on vacation with you. You might even enjoy that, too. That's going to help you keep more free time."</p> <p>"That's the thing I'm getting to. I should probably get in the pool."</p> <p>"You know," said Emily with a laugh, "it's really cute to talk."</p> <p>"Yes, it is. I was just joking with you. I never really considered letting you in as a friend, I mean, if you were with others, then I think this would help." She grinned at Maggie and added, "You know, you and I aren't exactly all that different."</p> <p>"I'm sorry," replied Maggie who smiled up at the older woman. "Do you need to get out of here, or something?"</p> <p>"Well, we've got time and I don't want to spend it feeling as if my future is boundless." "We really can't have that," said Emily as she started to get out of the pool.</p> <p>When it was time to go back to the house, Maggie made her way back to their room. Emily was right about her parents asking for free time. The only thing she did was sit and wait for their return from their vacation.</p> <p>When it was time for Maggie's first visit, she was delighted to see that Emma looked like she had gotten away from her for a while and she really appreciated that she hadn't. The younger girl was wearing a short, tight, white tank top that showed off her nice, wide, but nicely shaped, breasts and the matching white bra that didn't even come close to covering her beautiful, pink nipples. When she looked at her watch she had to admit that she had got a little earlier than expected.</p> <p>Even more astonishing to Maggie was that her daughter had gotten out of the pool, while the two beautiful younger women were now sitting on the couch in her room. Her mother's eyes lit up when she saw the other young woman and she thought she knew where to look. She also couldn't wait to see what the other girls looked like, and she couldn't wait to have one of her friends.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>As Emily got back to the dormitory that evening, she was glad that her parents did not know how she got there nor could they tell that she had been in town on a professional tour.
