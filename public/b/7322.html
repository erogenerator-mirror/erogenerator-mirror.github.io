I knew that, although we had never actually discussed it before, there would never be any physical change if I didn't respond immediately to her request. The difference between a man and a woman is that, while a man has to do it once for his pleasure and an equally skilled man has to do it once for his pleasure. It is more complicated, and even more frustrating. I nodded and smiled at her. I was also excited.</p> <p>"Well, what would you like you two do?"</p> <p>I smiled at her and said, "I think that if you're sure, that this is okay with you."</p> <p>She looked at me for a few seconds in a daze, then said, "I think you're right. Come on, I'll walk you to the door."</p> <p>I nodded, followed her up to our room, put on shorts and a tank top, she kissed me and went across the hallway back towards our room. "Where are we going?" she asked.</p> <p>"I'm not sure yet," I chuckled. "When we're done you can't decide. So I'll let you choose when you get back here."</p> <p>"Okay," she said. "Let's get that shower going."</p> <p>I couldn't understand what she was talking about, but I decided to ignore it and try to get back to sleep.</p> <p>*** *** *** ***</p> <p>In the shower, I turned on the water, and we soaped ourselves up. "Mmmm," she giggled when our hands began fondling and running over each other's flesh. I leaned down and kissed her, then kissed my way down her neck. I reached out and ran my fingers up and down her inner thighs.</p> <p>"That tickles," she giggled.</p> <p>I looked up and her eyes were closed, her head on my shoulder. I reached up a hand and massaged her breast through her bra, then slid it back down to her belly. I massaged the cloth for a while, causing it to tickle her nipples. She reached behind and unclipped her bra, pulling it off of me. She let it drop with her shirt on its way off.</p> <p>"You're going to have to pay me back for that," I smiled and continued. I got up and quickly took off my own clothes. In a flash I was kneeling in front of her, taking off her panties. I pulled her legs apart so that my mouth could do its magic. As I tasted her with my tongue, and rubbed it against her lips. I rubbed my fingers up and down her slit, getting wetter and wetter with each passing. When I was ready I stood up next to her. "Do us," I said, and she reached for me. I stepped back.</p> <p>"Not yet," I said, looking back towards her, "I want to watch what you do first." I stepped over so that her head could continue to play with my nipples. She sucked hard on me, biting it gently with her teeth. It made me want to come very soon. I leaned down and kissed her, holding the back of her head as I started to kiss her. I reached one hand down between her legs, and began rubbing her lips. She moved her legs apart to give me better access to her center as we continued kissing.</p> <p>I lowered my face down to her breasts, then down further, rubbing her inner thigh with more pressure and more pressure. When I reached the base of her breast I started to lick the tip of her nipple, lightly pressing it with my lips. It was already hard, and after being teased for so long I could smell the aroma of her arousal and see her pussy juice on her panty covered lips. "That's it," she gasped as I took her nipple between my lips and sucked a bit until it was hard enough I could slide one of my fingers inside of her, pulling her lips apart like a rubber band.</p> <p>I turned around so that her pussy was facing away from me. I leaned into her, my hands on either side of her hips. My breasts were pressing heavily into her as I leaned down, kissing her neck, shoulders, and all of her upper arms. I began kissing her breasts again, but I wanted her mouth to have a kiss. My kisses continued down her stomach until I got close to her treasure. I slid my tongue out and lightly grazed her lips while I held myself with one arm. I slowly licked her lips and tasted her juices all around them until I got so that I had to kiss her pussy through her panty.</p> <p>"Oh," she moaned in between kisses. She kept her legs parted so that I could continue pleasuring her. "You're still hard," she said between kisses.</p> <p>Stillâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
