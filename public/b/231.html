His finger had traced the outline of her pussy lips, and it brushed across her clit. She moaned, pressing her hips against his cock.</p> <p>"I could do that some more," she giggled. "So could that?"</p> <p>And he did, and she gasped. He pushed her hips against him, moving his cock inside her, feeling the heat as they began to move together.</p> <p>They were completely lost in their passion now, neither taking their eyes from each other, their bodies moving as one in a timeless rhythm, feeling that wave rising, the swell inside them, and then the rush. She squeezed him with her pussy as she pushed into him, the sound of their wet squishing making them both groan.</p> <p>She pushed against him with her hips, and her ass cheeks clenched. He held still as their bodies ground against each other, and she bit her lip to keep from making a sound.</p> <p>Then she began to move her hips against him, the wetness of her lips on his cock making them both slick and slippery. He moaned, and her pussy gripped him tightly, as her finger began to circle his nipple.</p> <p>"Mmm, like that," she said, pressing against him, looking at him with those eyes, that face, and she began to buck her hips against him. "Mmm," she grunted, and her thighs pressed his ass.</p> <p>And he moved his hands under her, onto her ass, squeezing. He squeezed her ass, and it was all he could do to not lean forward on her, to bend his body, let himself slide under her and into her warmth.</p> <p>She rocked her hips against him, grinding into him with a slow rhythm that was almost too gentle. He could tell she was close, too, and he pulled her against him, pushing deeper into her.</p> <p>Finally, he pushed her onto her back, her head up, her eyes closed, her tongue lolling. He pushed her legs apart, his cock throbbing inside her, so she could feel it.</p> <p>Then he pushed into her again, sliding past the warmth of her pussy up to her clit, rubbing her.</p> <p>"Oh, Chris," she gasped. "It's so sensitive to you." She shuddered as he touched her, and he smiled. "I know you'll feel like this. You'll be hot, and tight. Like velvet, hot and ready to take me, I promise."</p> <p>She leaned her head back onto his shoulder, her arms going up to encircle his neck, her tongue going into his ear as he slid into her. "I love the way it feels when you do that," she whispered. "I love you, and I want you to fuck me, you know that. Please?"</p> <p>Chris rolled his hips, slowly slipping his cock into her pussy. He moved his hips back again, and pulled out just a little, the head of his cock barely making contact with her pussy lips, until he reached his hand around to massage her clit, and then he gently began to stroke her. His cock rubbed her g-spot as his thumb rubbed her nipples, sending little tingles inside her that grew with every stroke.</p> <p>Her tongue slid out of her mouth to lick his ear, the vibrations of her moan sending another surge to his cock. "Oh, yeah," she murmured, her hips slowly bucking against him. "That's good, that's nice. Let me feel you throb inside me when you come...oh, you're going to come in me, aren't you?"</p> <p>"You want me to come, baby? You want me to come?" He watched her intently through his eyes, trying to keep his breathing steady. "Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yes, please...oh, yes," she gasped. "Yes, I want you to come inside me. And come on my body, Chris."</p> <p>"How's that?" he asked slowly. Her hips moved in little thrusts that seemed to add to their connection, each one sending an electric charge through their bodies. "What do you want?"</p> <p>"Oh," she said, almost in a whisper, and she began to pant, her voice thick with lust. "God, I want you to come in me. I want you to fuck me. Don't stop, don't stop."</p> <p>He pressed against her, slowly slipping from her, his cock sliding out as he slid into her again, then she groaned deeply, eyes half-closed with desire, and she reached down between her legs to rub herself. "Oh, babe, I love the way you do that, you fucker, I love you, Chris." She put her hands on her knees, then pushed them together to hold herself up whileâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
