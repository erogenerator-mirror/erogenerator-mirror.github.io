It's very beautiful here, Sir. I live alone."</p> <p>I put the phone down and we looked at each other for a minute. I was the one that didn't want to be alone right now. I was being nice to her and I think she liked it.</p> <p>"What would you like to do tonight?"</p> <p>"I know a great little diner called 'The Dog', in town. I have a wonderful little table."</p> <p>"That'll be about the time you make your date."</p> <p>She asked if I had any special reason I didn't want her to see me. I told her it's not necessary and I'd go get her.</p> <p>"Do you know much about the food?"</p> <p>"No, just what I like."</p> <p>"It smells so good."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Yes, really. It's the best thing to have in our town. What are you thinking about?"</p> <p>"I've never had anything so good. I'm just thinking about how much I miss mom."</p> <p>"Oh, I see. Let's get out of here and have a nice long soak before you get to bed."</p> <p>She went back into her bedroom, closed the door, and I sat in the living room and watched TV for a while. I was just enjoying the scenery.</p> <p>When I got back to the living room, I found mom waiting for me with an extra towel wrapped around her head. I sat down on the couch with her. She took my hand and we sat there until the movie was over. Mom said the same about me. I think I've lost my best friend to being a little slut of a boy.</p> <p>I had a good time, but, unfortunately, things were so wrong and it didn't seem right at all. I told her that I'd have to go in to work in an hour on Thursday and we'd better get going and get back to her or I was going to fuck her senseless in the middle of her office parking lot. I didn't say a word, but I knew.</p> <p>At least, that's what it felt like to me.</p> <p>As she drove back, she said that it was wonderful but, she would probably be back home by evening if I was so lucky. I told her that would be my best decision but I was going to be honest.</p> <p>"Mom, I really want to marry you. I want you in my life forever."</p> <p>"I know, I know. There should always be an opportunity for an opportunity for you to be a man to be with. I don't know anything better on this than that."</p> <p>"Thank you, Mom."</p> <p>"Honey, I can't let you make your life decisions by being a good boy. You don't deserve that much."</p> <p>"Mom, you're a great mother. If I ever see you in the office again, I promise I'll be happy to see you."</p> <p>"Honey, if I ever catch you looking at my breasts, you'll be a walking, talk show in my office. You're such a sweet boy."</p> <p>"I'll keep my eyes on you the whole time."</p> <p>When we got back to the apartment, I kissed mom twice and took her home. She got herself a sandwich out of her purse, we ate and then I headed to my room to get ready. It was a weird time. When she showed up and looked like she was going to be in the mood, she looked so amazing that I nearly walked right up to her. She grabbed me by the hand told me we had to have a quickie so that she could feel the rest of me before she left.</p> <p>"When will you be back for dinner, Daddy?"</p> <p>"If you're still feeling that way, we'll get there in about an hour. Take your time, but do what you're told."</p> <p>When I came home, my dick was like steel rod from this point. I walked in the door and my dick jumped to attention in record time. I pulled mom into me and just held her. Her body felt so soft. I kissed her passionately and said, "I'm going to be a very busy boy in the future." She smiled and said that she sure felt like the role model she was supposed to play with me.</p> <p>"Do you want me to leave you alone in your room or is that going to take forever?"</p> <p>"I think we should move to the bed."</p> <p>"I'll be up soon."</p> <p>I watched mom go out the door and then I went to my study as I put on my suit.
