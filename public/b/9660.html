She continued to stare straight ahead. Then with another sigh, she began to walk across a darkened area. It was a fairly quiet area, with small trees to the back and a path that would draw you down to a river.</p> <p>She walked through a small clearing, and looked around. She was still wearing the jeans and t-shirt she had worn out the night she had spent in her bed, and she had a pair of white shoes on, and she had some socks around one of her feet. She knew her hair was braided back and down, but she was still wearing the sweatshirt. She saw that a tree nearby had a small flat piece of wood hanging loose on it, and she reached out and touched a piece of wood, which had a strange green and blue glow. Then she turned her head to check the path.</p> <p>A path that went through a gap in what looked like a pond, and then up onto something on the other side. The path ended in a small building and a large brick building built out of an old log that must have supported the river for the last several miles.</p> <p>She leaned forward to turn on the light above the cabin as the wind came up on the bank. The wind was warm, and the smell of pine and wood filled the cabin. She was a bit surprised by how clean and inviting it looked, and how comfortable it felt to be standing outside. She felt her nipples getting harder under her bra as she thought of the possibilities of being out in a warm evening.</p> <p>At the back of the cabin and outside she saw a few people sitting on the porch and walking around and around the front of the house out onto the back. She watched as the people walked around and talked to one another. She saw an older blonde woman sitting in the same chair as the brunette, and they seemed to be arguing back and forth on something. She felt herself getting turned on by all of this.</p> <p>The blond woman smiled at her and then motioned to someone behind her.</p> <p>"Hello, I'm Tracey." The woman said to the blonde woman.</p> <p>Tracey walked over to the taller blonde woman.</p> <p>"Do you ever watch movies with your friends?" Tracey asked her.</p> <p>"No, not really. We just watch movies. It's more for fun." Carla responded as she held out her hand to the tall woman.</p> <p>Carla felt butterflies in her stomach as she reached out her hand. To her surprise one of the women holding Tracey's hand moved closer to Tracey. The woman's fingers touched Tracey's neck as she leaned close to Tracey.</p> <p>"Well, I haven't really. There's some good stuff, and there's a bit of porn, but that doesn't really interest me at all." Tracey said.</p> <p>The woman leaned in and kissed Tracey on the cheek.</p> <p>"Have you ever been to a strip club, before?" The woman asked softly as she lightly brushed her fingers over Tracey's cheeks and ears.</p> <p>"Well... yeah, once." Tracey replied honestly. "I didn't really get that far of an opportunity." The woman continued as she pulled Tracey closer.</p> <p>"Does it bother you?" The woman asked Tracey.</p> <p>"No. Not really. I mean it's a little exciting to be a woman and to go from being attracted to a woman to being a woman to be attracted to a man." Tracey responded.</p> <p>"Have you ever had an experience like this before?" The woman asked Tracey as she lightly ran her fingers down Tracey's neck, across her collarbone, and down her chest.</p> <p>"No." Tracey replied, still trying to hide the arousal that she was feeling.</p> <p>"Do you ever look forward to another lesbian experience, like, when other women look on the internet or see a naked woman?" Tracey's tongue licked her full lips.</p> <p>"Hahaha..." The woman said with a bit of a laugh.</p> <p>"Don't get too wrapped up about it." The woman said smiling and looking Tracey up and down. "Do you mind if I take you with me and help you with the camera?"</p> <p>Tracey looked at the woman with a bit of trepidation in her eyes, looking around for her. She felt the woman's hands gently caressing her chest and stomach as she felt fingers caressing her breasts, pinching the nipples.</p> <p>"Don't go anywhere." The woman said with a smile. "We'll finish filming soon and start watching some of your videos."</p> <p>The woman helped Tracey up off the porch.</p> <p>"You're not done are you?" The woman asked Tracey again with a mischievousâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
