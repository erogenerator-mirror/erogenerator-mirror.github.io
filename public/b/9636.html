I'd longed to do it for her, but was afraid it would spoil the atmosphere. I didn't have a boyfriend of my own! But the feeling of her tongue on her lips made me come. My stomach tensed with pleasure as my cock exploded in her mouth and then I pulled back and my cum covered the insides of her cheeks as she licked her lips. She smiled at that. When I'd been a man in the past, I'd had girlfriends who'd done that, but I'd never expected an experienced woman to lick me clean as a result. Then there's the girl next door, the one who had been a virgin. That was how I'd wanted her and the feeling of her tongue around my cock had driven me wild...</p> <p>Now, I was going to be a monk, and to be honest, I really didn't think I'd be able to keep my cock straight, with her lips around it all the way. But she had done it...</p> <p>"Are you in the tub?"</p> <p>I smiled with my cock at her. "Yep, baby. It's nice and steaming. You're gorgeous and your hair is so silky and soft."</p> <p>"Thanks," she replied with a sigh. "But I'm gonna take a shower first, though. I'm gonna be a while."</p> <p>It took me a few moments to realize she wasn't going to be a minute. But I let it pass and took the first shower in town. It was a nice, relaxing affair with some hot tub time, some nice steamy sex. I think the whole evening was spent in love with her eyes, her body, her pussy. We finished our bath and I felt relaxed enough to put my jeans on and slip on a pair of loose fitting sweats. She'd been right, I was a lot stronger than I thought.</p> <p>She stood up when I finished rinsing my hair. "Wow. You have an unbelievable stamina for a novice."</p> <p>"Why am I a novice?" I asked with a smile.</p> <p>"It's an amazing skill you learn in school," she said, smiling up at me. That smile, I knew, would melt me, just like it's done every day. It's just as magical. "Come on. Let's go find the other girls and go somewhere for a while."</p> <p>I followed her to the pool. There was hardly anyone there, just the two joggers in the grass. I walked to the group and sat down on one of the benches and looked around us. I was feeling better than I had in probably a long time. "I can't believe I'm doing this. I really didn't expect anyone to come like that."</p> <p>"Neither did I," said the blonde at my side. "What's so special about you, Jeff? Even after being around so much...how did you ever meet that hot young girl?"</p> <p>"I'd thought she only had eyes for her husband?" I asked. That had never bothered me before. "We don't have any children. Isn't that surprising? I would have had to be very careful, and you were always around."</p> <p>I couldn't tell what the blonde's comment was, but I had to admit I sort of liked it. Her husband was a lucky man as well. She was a hot looking woman and had a great body... "Yeah, I'd have had to be VERY careful about being seen with anything less than a bikini top on..."</p> <p>I smiled. When a girl was your type, you'd never think something so incredible would be a thing. "You have good taste in women."</p> <p>"Maybe," she said slyly. "But it's time for you to make a decision again. Who might you be?"</p> <p>"That depends on what you're thinking. I mean, this is pretty...interesting. What's this all about?"</p> <p>"You're still young, right? We won't push this, will we?" There was a coy tone in her voice. There might be a lot of other reasons to make her approach this way, but that was fine with me. After all, I was her friend's husband and she was my neighbor, so why should I try to be the one to make the biggest decision?"</p> <p>"I guess," I said, but I don't think I wanted to. Somehow I didn't think she'd be able to resist me.</p> <p>"Well, you'd better come up to the house tomorrow night. I'll be there with my new friends, and I've got plans."</p> <p>"You mean, you're going to invite them to dinner?"</p> <p>"Well, that just might work..." she seemed to have the courage to play the part of host. "Besides, you're pretty decent looking, you know?"</p> <p>I smiled as Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
