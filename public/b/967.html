He didn't sound thrilled or excited. He felt a chill run through his body at the prospect.</p> <p>Dana let out a quick gasp. She felt her heart begin to pound in her chest, and her pulse begin to race as she envisioned her husband's thick cock buried inside the soft warmth of her sex. And then with another long gasp she turned and began to strip off her clothes while looking at Mike, who was grinning from ear to ear.</p> <p>"Is this right?," she asked him in a husky voice. It felt as if she was shaking and trembling. He simply nodded enthusiastically while watching her. She saw the look of approval in his eyes and a wave of fear and guilt, as if he didn't like what he saw.</p> <p>"Mike. I don't know how to do this," she said. She felt her face turning a deep red. She was so nervous for him to just do this to her so easy, but she had to know it was going to be an amazing experience. If she didn't do exactly as he had expected, he might not want to do this. And then she realized that he could be shocked, disgusted with her, hurt. She could feel the conflict in herself. She didn't want to do this. This is what she had to try, what she didn't want to do.</p> <p>"Okay," he said, "why don't we stop here first?"</p> <p>"Okay," she said before taking a step closer to the stranger. She leaned forward and kissed him on the mouth. Mike's lips tightened momentarily, then they parted. Her lips lingered lightly on his for a moment before quickly pulling away.</p> <p>"That wasn't right," he said. Even though he had kissed her before, he was not accustomed to such aggressive behavior. But she didn't seem to know what bothered him. She was acting so much more submissive to him at this point than he had been.</p> <p>"I guess it's okay," she said, and then pulled away. She looked over her shoulder as though she were going to get it as easily as if she'd said, "but it's not what everyone does." She didn't feel like she was ready to let that man leave the building yet—she was sure.</p> <p>"I think you better go," he said. He stood up and began to turn toward the door.</p> <p>"No Mike, let him go," she said, and then stopped him. She stood in silent support as he took a step forward, and then began walking toward her. His hands were shaking in his hands, but he was determined. He held out his hand as well. Dana grabbed his hand as well, and then pulled him toward him so she could kiss him again. She held him around the waist as they kissed, and then turned to walk away, before following him through the door.</p> <p>Mike was a gentleman, he thought, but he couldn't help feeling conflicted. Part of him wanted to take full control. But he couldn't see how it would help things. He thought about how he felt about his wife, and then suddenly stopped himself. If she were so eager to please him, why would she want to do this to him?</p> <p>For once, Mike didn't want to put a stop to this. He didn't know if he could trust himself to stop Dana from leaving him. If he had his doubts in that, he'd tell her she had to quit. But there was a very real likelihood that this might make her feel even worse about herself, even if she were more hesitant to go through with it. If she were going to stay, she had to quit this once and for all.</p> <p>"Okay, okay," he said, and turned toward his wife. "I'll be on my best behavior," he said.</p> <p>Dana stood there in indecency for a moment, but quickly put her arms up around his neck and hugged him. He smiled at her in appreciation.</p> <p>"Are we going to talk about this?" she asked.</p> <p>"Maybe," he said.</p> <p>"Why are you doing this?" she asked him.</p> <p>"Because we're both adults, and I can decide not to leave," he said.</p> <p>"And I really can't tell you why," she said.</p> <p>"Because it would be wrong, Dana," he said. Then they both turned, and walked back toward the hotel.</p> <p>As they walked past the door, they stopped and hugged one another briefly and then stood looking at one another for a long moment. It had never felt so much like this with Mike before. He couldn't help but wonder how much of that he was making up for. He had been caught up in this world before. She had never felt so completely—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
