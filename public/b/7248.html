This is all you can do to stop it happening as my tongue finds its way to the area behind your balls, and it is the most erotic thing I has ever felt. And I love your balls. And yours is as beautiful as it was before.</p> <p>In just what you want, it is as wonderful as you want. I can still feel the warmness of your sperm in my mouth, and the sweet taste of you as you pump into my mouth. Each time you feel yourself getting close you push against me until you cannot take anymore. When you are done you give a quiet scream and collapse onto the bed.</p> <p>After a very long time you open your eyes, and we kiss once more, before we fall asleep in each other's arms.</p> <p>The clock on the bedside table shows 4:30 am. You are up and up sleeping on your side with your arm across my breasts, and with a pillow around your chest. I lay in bed and you feel sleepy once more. I am the first to awake. I want to tell you something. You tell me yes, and you move closer, and I move closer until we are spooning. It is so nice, so natural and so wonderful, you are so warm and wonderful, and the way you move with me and feel the love and warmth you feel between us is the most wonderful experience both of us together.</p> <p>You whisper to me “what in the hell made you do all this?” I smile and kiss the top of your lips lightly, while reaching over and start kissing and caressing your back as one hand goes south and takes another place between your legs.</p> <p>As if in a dream, I hear it. Your soft sigh as your hand is inside your panties, and a finger sliding into your pussy. I stop and reach up and kiss you softly. I lay close to you, my arm cradling your back as my hand moves down to your breasts. With the other hand I touch yours, and gently pinch your nipples as you continue to explore your body.</p> <p>I move my mouth onto yours, and our tongues entwine for a moment. You have your hand between us cupping my breast, and I can feel that wonderful wetness between your legs, and you can feel my fingers sliding into you. You have another moan, and your hips start bucking. Your lips are on my neck now, and your breast on mine.</p> <p>I move my hand down to cup you, and your legs wrap themselves around me as we roll together in a sensual rhythm with both our hips moving in unison. You have your eyes closed and your lips are slightly parted, but you move them in time with every gentle thrust of my fingers.</p> <p>You reach over and start to slide down your body, leaving just your head on the pillow again, so I just move a bit so you are facing it. And I kiss you softly so as not to wake you, as your lips part for me, and my tongue starts to playfully touch a little bit of your lips. Then with the tip of my tongue I start to stroke the lip of your pussy, which has now been shaved completely bare. There is an intake of breath, and then another moan, as you are now stroking that same pussy that had just been a part of our pleasure.</p> <p>When you feel my tongue on your clit, you move your hips a bit, and then a few more inches just enough to let me know you want more. I slide two fingers into a warm vagina as my tongue starts flicking your clit, still caressing only your lips, feeling the softness as I slide them in and out of your hole. Your pussy starts to leak more of your juices. “Mmmm .. babyyy .... ohhhhh ... yeahhh....”</p> <p>Just as you are reaching orgasm, you can feel me move my face away from your pussy and move my mouth. I have moved out from under you and my tongue is now licking your slit from bottom to top tasting your own juices. Your hips rock in a long shudder that you know is going to be loud to wake your neighbors.</p> <p>Your hand starts to move with your hand, and I feel that exquisite moment where you can feel your release almost as if on a cue that’s just started to spread from your pussy to your lips. Your orgasm has your mouth open and you almost scream. As you arch upwards, your fingers thrust in and out of your vagina, I put my two fingers back in your lips, and I slide up to slide in first one and then two fingers to slowly start out. When I slide my hand out I lick the juices that you have continued to slowly drip on the bed. I move my face back down to you kissing you softly, tasting all of—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
