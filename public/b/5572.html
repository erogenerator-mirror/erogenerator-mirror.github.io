"I think you'd do anything to hear it, to know it's about."</p> <p>"I mean the very least," I added. "Are you comfortable with me calling you, not about the fucking?"</p> <p>"And speaking from experience, I think I won't even be tempted to call you," she said. "I'll just call you," she said with a shrug. I knew what she was getting at and that I should be happy. I could tell by how she sounded that she was serious by the way she sounded.</p> <p>"But I have two questions," she said, looking at me carefully and hesitatingly. "Two questions," she asked, with a nod.</p> <p>"Okay," was my reply. "Which were?"</p> <p>She shrugged and looked down at her shoes and crossed her arms over her chest.</p> <p>"I want you to fuck me when we're back here," she said, "and I want you to fuck me like this right here. Just say, okay? If you don't feel comfortable fucking me, then no fucking."</p> <p>I was surprised by the last offer from her. She had been a perfect little sex toy and it was clear that she wanted nothing more.</p> <p>"And what will it be?" I asked. "Do we have a deal?"</p> <p>"You know," she said with emphasis, "that you won't feel any better being on her lap than when we're on the bed. If we're back here where we're going to start with you on her legs. When you get down on your hands and knees. If you're down on your knees now. Or on all fours. Or in any other position you desire."</p> <p>"And what's your wish and what's yours," I asked. I smiled at her and she smiled back.</p> <p>"First thing will happen," she said, "if we're all here at the exact same time. You'll need to get on your knees. Then you have to wait until we all settle into position. I want you to keep your ass to the side. Got it?"</p> <p>She nodded and I moved forward and knelt down in front of her. I lifted her right foot and put it on the carpet on the carpet near her feet. Then I used my left hand to grab her ass and pull her to me. She reached down and spread her ass cheeks open for me. The sight of her little asshole right there right at the edge of the carpet was almost too much to bear and I took my time.</p> <p>"Okay," she said, "I think it's time. I'm still a virgin. And it won't be that easy. I'm not a faggot. I can't go to a school full of gay boys and have a fucking erection."</p> <p>"Yes you can and you're sure not going to be any bigger than I am," I said. "You're a virgin. And if you want me on my knees in front of you, you let me take over."</p> <p>She looked over at me and a little smile creased her lips. "Yes. Yes," she agreed. I moved forward and slid my hard cock back into her as she spread. She took me deep like that, which didn't quite feel right, then pulled back a little, so I was sliding back out of her and then back in again. I reached around and grabbed her tits and squeezed them. I heard her sigh and move her hand around on the carpet to reach back and touch her pussy. She took her hand away when I started to slide in and out of her and I could feel her fingers on her clit as I slid in and out of her. Her breath was ragged as I picked up speed and intensity. My hand was rubbing her pussy almost continuously now, as well as her breasts. I felt her muscles bunching and tightening inside, like she was trying to squeeze the life out of me. She was trying to push back against me so I thrust forward more forcefully and I felt her body tense around me. I pulled her hand and pressed harder against the fabric of her panties, so her legs wrapped around me. Then I felt her pussy ripple and tighten around my cock as she came.</p> <p>"Sorry," she whimpered, looking over at me through half shut eyelids. I smiled.</p> <p>"Your fault," I replied. "Your fault. You're just making matters worse." I pulled back just a little and quickly grabbed her right ankle and twisted it upward and onto her side. As soon as she was twisted, she grabbed me and pressed herself against me. We were fucking in the living room and it was going on outside. I felt her leg rise off the carpet and it was enough to push me over the edge.</p> <p>We pulled apart immediately as she pushed herselfâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
