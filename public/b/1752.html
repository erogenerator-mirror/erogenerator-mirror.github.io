We just finished supper. Are you starving?"</p> <p>"Yep. I'm hungry."</p> <p>"I think we need to take a break from all the fucking we've been doing."</p> <p>"What's that? What's wrong?"</p> <p>"What's wrong? I thought we were saving ourselves for marriage."</p> <p>"What? We've been married for four months. Don't you remember when we were only in our teens. Why do you think my ass is still hanging out of my pants? That's the reason why you're always saying "we aren't going to go out anymore"."</p> <p>"I don't know, but if you don't want to do it, we can. We could go to the local Mexican restaurant and have a meal there. Maybe pick up some dinner and maybe a little wine. I don't want you to be upset."</p> <p>"Fine. I'll take something like that and we'll be by your place after lunch. That is, if you don't mind."</p> <p>"I haven't had a reason not to go anywhere with the kids so I'm glad we will have our dinner."</p> <p>We walked back to the apartment building hand in hand. We stopped by my place to pick up the kids. By then we would be back at work by the middle of the afternoon.</p> <p>I gave the boys a kiss and a warm hug that I always remember. They jumped up and hugged me too. "Thank you for what little trouble you've had in the past four months," they both said.</p> <p>"You've been a good sport, don't you think?"</p> <p>Both the boys looked me up and down. "Oh yeah, we didn't have trouble."</p> <p>"It's all right. We can all have trouble in the future. If you want to change your lifestyle now, then come over tomorrow. We know how you've been treating the kids."</p> <p>I nodded yes. That didn't make sense.</p> <p>The boys and I went home, and each turned to kiss me. I gave them each a quick kiss and hug so they didn't feel weird. When they stood there staring at me like that I turned to them and hugged each one one in turn. I felt so good, holding their eyes.</p> <p>"I'm taking a bus to work tomorrow. I'll see you later."</p> <p>"Can we stop being friends and get down to business?"</p> <p>We both kissed them again. "Whatever you say, we still want more time. What would you like?"</p> <p>"We both want to watch a movie sometime."</p> <p>We went back to my place where we kissed another kiss to each other. I went to bed and was asleep before I could even get one to sleep.</p> <p>The next day I heard a voice ask me, "Are you sure? I'm tired."</p> <p>"Yeah, right. I had a long day. I was just getting ready to go to bed when it got quiet. I didn't think I could do it without you."</p> <p>"It's all right, Honey. I'm all right. I'm all right too. That one was different than the one to you."</p> <p>"It was kind of cute."</p> <p>"The last one wasn't so nice. Was it worth to us? I loved watching you."</p> <p>I got up from my chair and walked over to her. "Would you come with me for a second?"</p> <p>She looked at me and got up, and she walked with me to my bedroom. I pulled back a bed linen sheet to wipe up the semen I'd just been cleaning up in my sink. When we were alone I asked her, "How do you feel?"</p> <p>"I feel great. I've been out of it for a long time. I feel good, I feel better, I feel like I've been happier in years than in most of my years."</p> <p>We looked into each other's eyes for the longest time. I felt like I was going to cry. "Honey, I'm so nervous about tomorrow. I really don't have any plans."</p> <p>She smiled and said, "Honey, if you are nervous, I understand. I was just worried about how we feel about ourselves and about how we'll look at people when we're both in our twenties."</p> <p>"I think that's kind of the same thing about us. If we're both nervous, we probably shouldn't be doing this so hard until we're twenty again."</p> <p>"Well, all I can say is 'I'm glad we are so happy,' you know? I love you."</p> <p>She held me and hugged me for a few minutes. She broke the hug saying, "I know that sounds weird, but I feel a lot better this way after what you did to me last night.
