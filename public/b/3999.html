The wall behind me shamed my senses. There was no longer anything to worry about. I was completely aware of my surroundings and my position. I was on the floor and my legs were spread widely out in front of me. I was lying completely flat. It felt like I was a thousand years old, but I just couldn't tell. I could feel the warmth of someone on my back. I could hear a soft chime then a very loud sound of metal clacking. I heard one of many voices shouting something.</p> <p>"I'm gonna tear your fucking balls off!"</p> <p>"I'm going to cum!"</p> <p>"Here they come!"</p> <p>"I'm going to fill your fucking ass up with my hot jizz!"</p> <p>After awhile the voice of the voice was replaced by a male voice that could only be my son! I couldn't believe what I was hearing! Was this just a nightmare? What kind of freak was I in and was I dreaming!</p> <p>I heard a sound like a gunshot and I looked up, almost as if my head had been grabbed and pulled back by some invisible hand. I started to run towards where I was coming so that I wouldn't wake up my son. As I got to the door of my house there was a loud banging sound and a hand clapped over my mouth to shut it up! I looked over my shoulder.</p> <p>"Shhhh, this is important! Keep cool and come back to me."</p> <p>"I'm tired, mom. I'm not sure I can do this."</p> <p>I heard the noise the same tone that came when I was tired on the job and it had the same effect on me. I turned to face my son. His body looked completely different, more lean and muscular. I could only guess that he was around twenty-five and I could only guess at what they looked like.</p> <p>"Let me go. I'm tired!"</p> <p>I turned me body around facing him. My hands were tied above my head, but I didn't care. I had my arms and legs tied to the other end of the bed frame. He looked at me with a questioning look.</p> <p>"What the fuck is going on here?" He had to raise his head a little and his facial expression could just about be described as shocked. No! He didn't have to know any of this!</p> <p>I walked closer to him and placed my hands on his cheeks. I pressed a little harder on him to get his attention.</p> <p>"What are you doing here, dad? I told you not to leave."</p> <p>"I'm not going to leave now! If you don't let me go I'll just let myself out." His voice was starting to get a little shaky and he was almost panting as I looked through at him. His eyes were red and his forehead was trembling with the strain of standing the way I did.</p> <p>"Do you have any idea where you are and why you and your sister are leaving?"</p> <p>"What's your concern?"</p> <p>"I'm going to have to explain everything to you and I don't want to lose my mother again."</p> <p>"I have no idea where we are going, but I'm not moving out of here."</p> <p>"I think you should do exactly as I say. But do what I say and when I say. I'm going to show you the house and make love to you one last time."</p> <p>"Please, dad! I'm still tired and I don't know what's going to happen. I just need to know that I'm safe here."</p> <p>"That's what I thought but now I really need you to do me a big favor." It would have made sense without asking and it did. I walked him over to the window and leaned him onto his back. I leaned in to kiss him on his lips before I began moving down his body. I could see he was trembling and his eyes were squeezed tight. He tried to pull away but before he could pull away I stuck his legs in the air and tied them to the corners of the bed frame with more rope. "Stay still," I ordered him. He shook his head yes until I had attached his feet to the bed frame. When I was satisfied he had a pretty good hold of his legs I sat back in the chair and looked at him. He was a small man, slightly built, but much smaller in stature. His eyes were a clear brown and his hair was cut into long and straight. There was nothing about him that had any resemblance to me that I knew about. As he looked at me I saw the fear fill his eyes. A part of me felt sorry for him.</p> <p>"I'll teach you a lesson, dear," I saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
