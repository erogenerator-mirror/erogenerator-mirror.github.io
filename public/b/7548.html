I'll see." She said smiling to get the message in the wrong direction again. "I just need to make sure I'm on my way home from work tomorrow. I have a class early next week if that's alright." She reached her hand up over his arm. It felt good to be caressing that one, and he felt so much stronger still. He didn't care though; he just knew that that was better than his dreams. He wasn't sure what had gotten into her before he had fallen asleep, but he didn't want to think anymore. He really did not know what had happened to her. She had never been afraid, she liked him, she wanted him. She was his, and she wasn't a force to be afraid about. He realized that he didn't know what had gotten into her, what had gotten him into this world, and he was certain that she could never be his. He had felt so much for her, it was unbelievable. He was certain that this was going to be a long and beautiful relationship with no regrets, no regrets no worries - for the rest of their lives and in their hearts as they would get there.</p> <p>Her hand drifted over his arm. It felt good to be touching something else. She moved his hand up and began to stroke her other. Her hand was cool against his palm. He couldn't tell if she was cold to him, or if it was the heat of their bodies that was making her warmer, but neither option seemed to make much difference. He was glad that she had gone to the hospital, but if it went to he would still be here. He wanted to stay in that warmth, but he also wanted to go home now.</p> <p>He closed his eyes and thought that all was going to be ok.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>"How was class?" Kelly asked with a smile on her face as she reached back and pulled a towel from the rack. She smiled at the question that had sprung from her mouth. Her face was full of determination and determination. Her eyes took on a new light as she watched him standing there in full gear. She knew that she would be going to get more than she bargained for if she didn't have a plan.</p> <p>"It was fine. Just a bit of a shock was the last thing we thought about after dinner. The class was great though." He said as he looked his friend in the eyes.</p> <p>"I was impressed." She said with a grin. "Just like you, I'd say."</p> <p>"Oh, good. It was just an introduction as to why I wanted to be with you and how I was trying to get some answers to my homework." He gave her a smile that he knew she loved. "I've been reading, and I hope you'll enjoy it."</p> <p>"Ok, so just what's to get started?" she asked as she walked to him. Again, she had had a lot of practice in her time, but what she had been reading in her sleep seemed like it had nothing to do with the whole world. She wanted to make sure that he appreciated that when she had gone to sleep last night, that the world had moved on. She knew that he was going to fall asleep now, too, so she walked past him and sat down on the couch in front of him.</p> <p>He looked back into her beautiful eyes and asked the question that he had known to be the same question every relationship that she had had.</p> <p>"What do I know? What's to talk about?" he asked.</p> <p>She just smiled at him as she began to strip off her blouse. He smiled as well, his hand still in his pocket watching her undress. She slowly undid her pants, pulling them down so that they just fell to the floor. Next she pulled her blouse up over her head. He just sat there for a moment, breathing heavy, trying to ignore how excited he had become. Her bra did nothing to stop his heart beating any faster, but she reached around to her back and undid the clasp, letting it slide down.</p> <p>Kelly turned around to walk towards him, but she was in front of him now. It looked like she had just finished stripping off her skirt. With one button undone she walked back over and sat down on the couch. He took in the sight of her as he got closer. His hands were now trembling as he lifted his chair out from the couch and sat down to watch as her naked body came in to view. She smiled so sweetly once she was done.</p> <p>"Wow," he said, "What're you wearing?"</p> <p>She moved towards him and took his hands as he got up from his chair. "I'm going to make some coffee..." she said as she got up from the couch and walked towards the kitchenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
