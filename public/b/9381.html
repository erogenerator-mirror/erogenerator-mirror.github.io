She traced circles on her own nipple. He closed his eyes, and with his own fingers, he pinched her nipple. His thumb pressed lightly on her nipple. She squeezed on it, and she felt the blood throbbing in her breast. He squeezed harder on her other nipple, and then let her nipple go. The little bud felt sore and cold in both places. She couldn’t tell whether he just wanted more, or whether she was going to make this impossible. Either way, the pressure from his hand against her tit made her think that he was just going to get lost in the sensations of her. She wanted them to go back to normal.</p> <p>It was difficult to tell if his fingers were still aching from squeezing her, or whether he might be enjoying her reactions to having her nipple manipulated. Her head fell back onto his shoulder. He leaned forward and wrapped his arm around her, keeping her trapped there. Her hand went from her breast to his waist, and then she slipped her hand around his cock. She could feel it and her hand was hard and hot. She didn’t think he could get harder in the dark, but she had never felt anything like it before. It felt wonderful! The sensation was heightened by having her fingers on his cock. He shifted further down on the bed, and her fingers found his balls. His cock seemed to be longer than she had seen it or felt, but the thickness and size amazed her. She couldn't take her eyes off it, and she was fascinated as it twitched with each beat of his heart. She felt him stir and her fingers went back to the top of his cock. She cupped his balls in her hand as his cock twitched between her fingers. The sensation of her hand on his dick made him shudder. She couldn’t believe how much he turned her on. The thrill of his cock between her fingers was making her pussy ache. She moved her lips down his abdomen, then over the hairs. She got closer to his navel, kissing it, and breathing warm breath. She could feel his belly moving as her kisses moved up his stomach. She could feel the hairs on one side of his pubic hair, and could feel him shaking his head as she kissed them, and she had a strange feeling of pleasure knowing that he hadn’t even touched her pussy – yet. She felt warm, wet, and very sexy.</p> <p>His head lay back on the mattress, and she could see that his cock was shiny with her saliva and his pre cum. She leaned back on her thighs. She spread her legs and started rubbing both cocks over her lips. She put two fingers in her mouth and started to suck them. She closed her eyes and tasted herself on his skin. She was completely overcome with desire. She kept on masturbating them, and felt him tremble at each stroke of the two fingers on her lips. She was almost ready to orgasm herself, and she didn’t want him to stop.</p> <p>She pushed a third finger in her mouth, and he took in a deep breath at her touch. His breath started to come in rapid puffs. He was trembling.</p> <p>“God, baby, I’m so close.” He cried out, “I’m coming, I’m coming, take me, please take me, “</p> <p>She pulled the fingers from her lips and licked it, then she licked him again, slowly. She kissed his cock once more and then he was coming back down on Earth. He was still going, but his breaths were coming in short bursts. Then he was done. He started to sit up and get off the bed, but then his hand went to his stomach.</p> <p>“No, let me, let me lay down,” he said as he lay down on the bed.</p> <p>He kissed her for a moment before asking if she was ready to go again. She just smiled and asked what to do.</p> <p>He got up on his knees and rolled the bedsheet over her. Then he got on his left side and got in the middle next to her. His cock rested by her pussy again, and his head was just to her ass. He moved a pillow under her hips and put the pillow so it pressed against her pussy. He kissed her forehead, and then she felt him licking her. She felt his tongue on her neck, then she felt it all over her shoulders.</p> <p>He didn’t move on her breasts, but the touch between her legs was gentle but the gentle was enough. His kisses were more on the back of her neck than on her shoulders. She started to roll her body on the bed. He held her left arm with one hand, then his arm went to her waist—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
