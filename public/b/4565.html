I looked out the window and saw that everyone was flying on the plane. At a point on the runway there were over 40 seats in the back and we were sitting directly in front of the crowd from the back.</p> <p>"Wow," I said. "Is this where we landed?"</p> <p>"Yep," said Janet, who was a senior in accounting at the university. "But these seats in the front are empty. The plane is moving and I will fly into the air with you."</p> <p>We had been going for ten minutes when I was finally able to find the right seat and had my eyes adjusted to the altitude. At first, I wasn't sure if the plane was really moving and when it did, Janet came to me and placed her hands on my shoulders.</p> <p>"What are you doing," she asked.</p> <p>"Just relaxing and enjoying the flight," I answered, as we took another taxi to the airport.</p> <p>"Are you nervous?" she asked again.</p> <p>"Not at all," I answered. "But my stomach feels tight. It's almost as if I'm not used to being alive."</p> <p>"You're doing pretty well for yourself," she said, "but if you like your flight to be, don't make it uncomfortable."</p> <p>"It's a little uncomfortable," I replied, not sounding too bad.</p> <p>With that, she leaned over and passionately kissed me. The kiss was so sensual and sweet that I felt as if my whole body was going to combust. When our lips finally parted, she leaned back and looked me in the eyes.</p> <p>"I love to kiss," she said, "and I want to do so many things with you. I would love to do it for the rest of your life."</p> <p>And with that, she smiled and smiled at me. The entire plane began to move, moving in what was supposed to be a straight line to an end and then continuing through the runway.</p> <p>It was a very beautiful sight to see, and I quickly realized that we hadn't even been flying for two hours before this whole thing started as a fantasy. I was in no rush to get to the airport or to board the plane and I was still in a state of euphoric bliss.</p> <p>Janet quickly got out of the plane as it headed into the runway to land. I was also left alone in the dark, enjoying the wonderful feeling of being alone for a moment or two, but knowing I was about to take it all in.</p> <p>"Are you in the airport?" Janet asked as she came back to me.</p> <p>"No," I answered as I took her hand and followed her to the gate.</p> <p>As we walked through the airport and stepped outside the terminal, Janet asked me for permission to take her suitcase. When she finished, she reached into her bag and pulled a small box out of it.</p> <p>"I don't know where you're taking me, but at least you bought me a plane," she said, looking at it. "It's from a friend."</p> <p>It was a very nice airplane. I took her bag into a large room and she walked out to the car a few inches behind me. It took me a moment to realize that we had been in a public plane before. I was surprised at the amount of excitement and excitement and I couldn't tell if Janet felt the same.</p> <p>In the short time we were in the car, Janet started to change and turned away from me and pulled her short skirt up. As it happened, it was her turn to put her hands on the wheel and lift her skirt up. From my vantage point, I could see that she was still wearing her tiny undergarment and as Janet lifted her skirt even higher, I could see that the small amount of bare flesh that had not appeared to me earlier was now exposed.</p> <p>"Wow," was all that I could say as Janet moved her hands to her side and pushed her skirt high across her waist and then dropped her skirt back down.</p> <p>I had trouble not staring at her and feeling guilty for looking at her like that. But the look I received was also incredibly sexy.</p> <p>When Janet sat down, the skirt flipped up a bit and there in front of me, still bare, was Janet's naked sex. I watched with amazement as she lifted her legs over the arms of the seat while her hand slid down to her vagina.</p> <p>"My God," I heard Janet say. "I never got a chance like this beforeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
