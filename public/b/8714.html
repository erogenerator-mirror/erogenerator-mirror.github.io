So much for that 'lesson,' you know!"</p> <p>"Oh so I did something to convince you! So this is all part of the game" she said pulling her bag off the bed, then pulled some clothes on over to the dresser while pulling the bed covers back. "Nope it's game time for me. No way you are still leaving me naked for all these clothes! Now how do you get here?"</p> <p>"I had to pick all these things up you know! Then I went shopping for the clothes that I was going to wear to dinner tonight. They're all in my bedroom. They should fit your bag but I didn't want to come over until I got ready. I figured you could come with me and help me get things in the house ready for tonight. What's your hurry."</p> <p>"You don't need to do that it's too late, what's with all this talking?"</p> <p>"I've just had a very big day so I'm going to take off, now come on!" She said as she pulled her bag off the bed and headed to the door just as she had left it.</p> <p>"Wait!" I shouted jumping from the bed "I want to see what you are wearing!"</p> <p>"You are not going to like what is on the other side of the door! Don't you dare come in until I get your phone number and I won't call!"</p> <p>"I promise!" I yelled "It won't happen again!"</p> <p>"I know but you got to do it!"</p> <p>"What do you think we are going to see?" I asked with a grin</p> <p>"We're going to the mall I thought that you would want some stuff that you are not used to!"</p> <p>"I did tell you I had to choose!" She yelled back. "It's not that I don't want to go!"</p> <p>"If you dress up and tease people, they will be looking past you to find out about it!" I started up and she started running back downstairs.</p> <p>"You better go!" I yelled after her.</p> <p>She ran back up the stairs as I grabbed her bags and followed her to the door. "This is your house and you do what you can to get yourself a dress. You need to know that you have more than a dress of yours in your closet. You need to know that this closet is not empty. It's not a closet you are going to walk through looking like you want to go out for dinner."</p> <p>"OK" she yelled back with a big grin.</p> <p>"Now are you going to behave or do I have to lock you in and let you up early?" I asked looking around the closet.</p> <p>"Oh I think that you don't want to come in here for dinner."</p> <p>"I didn't say that I was going to come here. I just wanted to get something from you."</p> <p>"Alright just take a couple of pictures as soon as you get here."</p> <p>She started taking pictures of herself in the dresser mirror. "These are only getting pictures, not good ones!"</p> <p>"Well I didn't realize that you could get better at taking pictures than I could! Ok good luck with your new wardrobe" I told her as I let her pull her bag out of the closet before I unlocked it to lock it.</p> <p>The next day was much like the day before. My mom was already getting out of bed. I sat down for breakfast in the kitchen before going out to see what was on the morning news. Mom picked it up in a little while and headed to the kitchen, as I saw her pull out a small bag of clothes, I was surprised that she already had the clothes that my room had taken from me. They had to be made from real clothes and they were out of the bag in mom's bathroom.</p> <p>"So what are you going to do for dinner?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'm going to go out on an errand and watch the news." She told me.</p> <p>"Ok, you could stay the night at my friend's apartment if you wanted, but don't let me see you get any clothes." I said, as I walked to my closet.</p> <p>"Yes you are probably right." She said back to me before I closed the closet door.</p> <p>"And remember if I see you or something you are not to come out to play for me!" I told her.</p> <p>"Are you sure mom?" I asked looking out of nothing.</p> <p>"Yes, I just want to see where it goes."</p> <p>"Well come on out there!" I said as I started walking towards the door.</p> <p>She had been to many restaurants in her family before.
