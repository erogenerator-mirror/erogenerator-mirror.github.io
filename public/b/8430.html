But this was different, I was a virgin, but now I was excited.</p> <p>I wanted to make him cum with me so badly.</p> <p>But I knew I couldn't, at least not tonight. I wanted him to give me his cum, like I'd never had even half of it before, not even after I'd been with someone else.</p> <p>What was I thinking?</p> <p>But I did want to have him make me cum with him!</p> <p>I turned round to meet his lips and found them locked with mine. We were soon tongue kissing, his tongue probing at my mouth and my hands finding his hard cock, which had obviously grown quite hard from just a few seconds previously.</p> <p>We made out, one of us kissing harder for a long time, his mouth pressing hard and his warm breath on my face. I could hear his breathing get deeper and heavier and he groaned softly against my mouth. My lips were so sore and sore from the pounding in my head and I was trying to stay as still as possible while we made out, but in truth, my head was getting dizzy.</p> <p>We broke our kiss, both of us so wet and slick now, and he pulled me up, dragging me along with him to the bed. It didn't take him long to get comfortable on it while I lay on my back, legs in the air, my knees bent.</p> <p>He knelt between my legs and I could barely keep still in my anticipation. He quickly moved his mouth to one of my nipples and kissed it, flicking the tip, as he held it between his teeth. I groaned softly when I felt him run his tongue across it.</p> <p>He moved back up, dragging the tip over my pussy lips as he moved, slowly and deliberately, pausing after each stroke to lick my clit, which he had rolled over before entering me. I shuddered as I felt the first waves of my orgasm build up, but he slowed, moving up over me so that I couldn't feel his cock even in my sopping wet cunt.</p> <p>But now, his lips kissed mine again, taking a chance that he could nibble at them, and gently I moaned into his mouth as he slipped a little down to take me in.</p> <p>He kissed my left nipple, then, moving to my right nipple, he slipped his tongue into my cleavage, sliding his hot mouth down over my nipple and making me shudder again as my mind flashed back and forth, back and forth from one tit to the other.</p> <p>He kissed and bit both of my nipples, making my body shiver with excitement as if it had never had these sensations before. Then, taking my nipple gently in his teeth, he sucked it in, rolling it between his teeth and his tongue, the way I would do to him.</p> <p>He rolled the nipple with his tongue, while his teeth were pinching it slightly, his fingers were sliding down over my clit as he pressed his mouth to the other. I was having trouble breathing and feeling the tension growing in my stomach.</p> <p>I was moaning softly but he must have sensed it, because he suddenly moved, and pulled me close to him, not that his cock had been even that long, but his hands slipped down over where my thighs met and he pulled me into the space between his legs so that I was completely out of control. His face was at the height of mine, looking down over my shoulder and down at my face, as he continued to kiss and lick my tits.</p> <p>He pulled my legs up and apart, and ran his palm over my pussy and all round, before dipping inside me again to find my clit again. His tongue flicked in and out of my mouth as we kissed, the movement taking his breath away as his tongue found its way into my mouth as much as it felt it.</p> <p>His finger slid back down and under the leg of my panties to my pussy, where it found my clitoris, and he started to play it in a slow, circular motion, his palm sliding into my pussy while he finger-fucked me.</p> <p>"Oh, God, please," I moaned into his mouth, pulling him closer, so that the whole of our bodies were now touching.</p> <p>"Please what?" he repeated, licking the tip of my tongue as he said that.</p> <p>"Please... fuck me."</p> <p>"I'll fuck you, I'll fuck you now." He grinned, leaning down to kiss me again as he started plunging his finger in and out of my pussy, going asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
