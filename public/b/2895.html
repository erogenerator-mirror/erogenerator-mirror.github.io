"We were just starting. Not enough, but you know what it's like after you've been with her, I just wanted to give you something special to share. It's like the old saying, 'If you can't share, then you can't have'. So I don't even know why we're doing this, but what can we do to share it?</p> <p>"Yes, the reason we've done it is because of what you've told me about yourself," she said, "and I want you to know now that I'm not just some pervert or some little geek that's going to fuck every girl he takes home with him. I know that you've come to me and I'm not just some whore, but I want you to know who I really are. I want you to know that if you ever get into any trouble, you'll have to talk with me, and if you come to me, if ever you get into anything between us, just ask. I understand that now that you know about the rules, but that's good too." She kissed each of my lips, then kissed me.</p> <p>"You were just so eager, honey. You were so hot and the last time I saw you had you all over your car driving away. You were so good, so hot, it was like you had gone everywhere at once," she said, kissing me again and moving her hands over my chest, "It was like you were an athlete, and it was like you'd been to a school event. You were amazing. The hardest thing was not being able to drive and not be able to walk." Her fingers began tweaking my cock through my jeans.</p> <p>"Yeah," I said, looking over at her, "and that was what the next rule is, right?" I laughed softly. I turned my head and pulled her down to my kiss again. She had a pained expression on her face. I felt her nipples hardening, then pressing into my chest as we both turned our faces away from each other. She broke our embrace, and looked at me expectantly.</p> <p>"The rules we have to do when we start... are for each to be able to share a few things with the other. If you choose not to, then you won't get to drive with me again tonight."</p> <p>I had always wondered what the other people's opinions were if I had come to the house. Now, I was wondering what she would do if I had stayed the night. "There's always tomorrow," I said in my best imitation of Karen's voice.</p> <p>"And I can drive you home by myself," she replied after a moment of hesitation. "I can't see you and you can't see me."</p> <p>I smiled and rolled my eyes. "I don't care how you drive, you know what I mean?"</p> <p>"I'm serious," she said without looking at me. "I'm not mad because I'd rather you didn't stay late and drive, but I was going to call you and I can't talk with you now because I'm going to call, and I don't want to explain, and I don't want you crying in my ear or in my hair. Even though I've known you for a week, we need to talk. The game is starting anyway, so do you want to come watch?" My cock was growing as she said it.</p> <p>"Ok, but I'm not sure I'm going to watch, but I can see you're okay with it," I replied. "Why don't we stay in the living room? If you want to watch, I'll sit at my desk while you watch, and if you want to come join us, you still can watch. We don't have to get dressed before you watch. Just ask me, it will be hard to explain why you're standing there at my place and watching us right now."</p> <p>"Ok," she replied, "I'll start the game. Just make yourself comfortable. You're not allowed to go before bedtime."</p> <p>"I'll just sit, since I don't have to keep telling you how I feel," I said seriously, and walked to the stairs, stopping to look back into the living room and smile.</p> <p>She leaned back on my couch and looked to see if I had noticed. I didn't. The TV was on but I hadn't looked at it.</p> <p>"Ok," she said slowly, "I know it's going to make it hard, but I'm curious about a lot of things. I see the world isn't your world. Like you're not a celebrity to me, but you are. Like I said, I'm like you."</p> <p>"I see," I said as I got to my feet.</p> <p>"So you love me, and I guess you're afraid thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
