Then he slid his fingers into her hair and pulled her head down.</p> <p>"Ohhh!"</p> <p></p> <p>"Please..."</p> <p>She was so eager, her mouth opening and taking him whole.</p> <p></p> <p>"Ohhhh, yes," he said softly.</p> <p>She started to move her hips, sliding him in and feeling him bottom out inside of her. She was so wet, it was a lovely sensation. "Yes... oh, God, yes..."</p> <p>He pulled her hair as she moved, pulling her tongue into his mouth again.</p> <p></p> <p>"Kiss me. Kiss me. I want you to lick my... my pussy."</p> <p>He didn't even answer. He moved forward, lifting her hips from the bed. She squealed against his lips as he slid into her tight wetness.</p> <p>"Ohh, ohh..." he groaned as she wrapped her legs around him.</p> <p>He started to move, pulling his cock out until he felt the wetness of her pussy. Then he entered her again.</p> <p>"Ohhh...," he moaned softly.</p> <p>***</p> <p>"Hey, where the hell are you going?"</p> <p>"Uh-huh," the voice said as he stepped away. "The place is so nice."</p> <p>He looked at her. His mouth had dried and he hadn't even taken a breath.</p> <p>She tried to shake her head. "Nuh uh."</p> <p>"That's not good."</p> <p>She wanted to tell him to move out but she didn't dare interrupt his progress. He was going to finish and then, maybe, she might be able to make a quick escape. She'd never gone without sex before, having been disappointed in her own orgasm.</p> <p>It didn't matter. As long as she could get him to give her what she wanted, she wanted to feel him inside her.</p> <p>"You don't have to. I'll make the most of it. I don't have to work to catch my dinner anymore." He looked tired and sad.</p> <p></p> <p>"I'm sure you don't have to. Why would you do that?" he asked quietly once his words were uttered.</p> <p>She shrugged her shoulders. "I don't know," she whispered. "I don't know what I should be doing. I never... I know how wrong it is. What about you? Is it your turn to ask? Or can you do it yourself?"</p> <p></p> <p>"It's... my turn," he said.</p> <p>"The fuck man it isn't?"</p> <p>"Yes. That's right."</p> <p>"Do you want to do the honors?"</p> <p>She shook her head. "I'm sorry. No. Please go ahead."</p> <p>He stepped back and reached for the bottle of wine. She stood there in the closet and watched him.</p> <p>"I'll help you," she said, taking the glass and pouring it out over the lamp to make room. She looked at him and smiled, glad to know this wasn't the night for a quickie and she wanted nothing more.</p> <p>He took the wine bottle out of her hand and set it on the end table, holding the wine glass out to her.</p> <p>"Here, let me pull your hair for you."</p> <p>She did.</p> <p>He watched as she moved around the closet, pulling it gently forward for him. Then he took the glass and poured for her.</p> <p>"No, no..."</p> <p>She couldn't see him, but she knew he was looking at her.</p> <p>As she stood there smiling, he pulled her head back again, this time pulling her hair through the looped end of it. She heard him taking it from the bottle.</p> <p>"Hmm..." he said.</p> <p>She'd never thought he did good with it. She'd never expected to see him in the state he was in and she was glad. But a lot of guys looked at her that way after their first sex.</p> <p>"Why are you looking at me?"</p> <p>She didn't even respond. She didn't dare ask a man's name.</p> <p>"No," he said softly.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"I don't want to stop you because you're upset or because I don't want to take advantage of you."</p> <p>She thought he was going to kiss her. But the kiss didn't come. Instead, he reached out and ran his hands over her body.</p> <p>"No," he said. She thought he was going to cup her breasts, but she wasn't sure. It wouldn't take much.</p> <p>She'd never been touched like that before. She felt like she should be ashamed of herself that she'd thought she was desirable and could kiss him and feel his bare skin touching hers, but sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
