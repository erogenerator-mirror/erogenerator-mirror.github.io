As it is with me, I have always been pretty independent as a girl and I guess I was different from most girls. This was something I didn't understand until I met my first lover at my university. I have no idea how he had the courage or courage to tell me that he had been a virgin, but what I don't count on is that it was not easy, not entirely.</p> <p>My first experience was with a girl from the previous night. What I didn't understand was what the girl had to do with my first time so I had no idea how to relate to her for real. I guess you could say I was just not ready for a relationship; at least with any particular girl. The girl was pretty shy and, I would guess, in her own right she had a small frame with medium size breasts and, most attractive of all, was in between wearing a bra to conceal them. I had always known her tits were a problem when she was wearing a bra, but now I could understand why she wore a bra to hide them and she made it clear that she wasn't interested in a boyfriend. (Don't ask what happened between the two. I'd have to admit that she had a crush on me for two years; it was the first real relationship I had with anybody, apart from my dad, of course, until I left him.) One night, when I was out with friends I saw this girl at a bar and one was talking to a man. To keep it interesting for a while I asked some of the girls down the road if she liked guys and some of them said yes, and, one at a time, told me how she thought they liked guys.</p> <p>One night, while we were on a date, she invited me into what she called a 'party', and I asked to go with her. We ended up in the bedroom and I was drunk enough to keep us apart. It turned out to be a very special night, and the next morning she was pregnant. (There was no way she was going to get pregnant)</p> <p>My first experience with a girl was when she went to pick up some guy at a bar. I'm not a fan of the guys, but I had some experience when I met him. He seemed to be a good guy, not too out of the traditional place in the city. There was the usual guy stuff, but it wasn't particularly exciting for me; I'm not a fan of the guys.</p> <p>After we left his apartment, he came over for a drink. We were standing in the doorway and I saw what an amazing person the guy must truly be. I must have been pretty buzzed or something because I just stared at him. I don't know how much of the drink I was carrying was really what he saw, but there was more than I realized.</p> <p>I told him how beautiful he was and asked if he wanted to go somewhere more private. He did, because he said 'what about my car'? But first we had to have a drink, so we went to my parents' bedroom. It was a huge suite, and my parents were so kind to let us do this in a private room, if you know what I mean.</p> <p>After we finished, we got more buzzed and he gave me a real big compliment about the body. He just walked to me, leaned in and kissed me. He took his hand and wrapped around my waist and started to move me towards him, and I pushed him away. "That was very nice of you to kiss me", I said. "I want one." When he gave me another, I leaned in and let him put his hands on my breasts before I broke away from him. When he kissed me this time I kissed him back, but then he had to go to the bathroom.</p> <p>I wasn't surprised. (That was part of the reason I had this idea about a date. It seems, if I do something that does not seem like what you want to do then there are a great many men to pick up at a second date.) I think he liked it too and I know he thought it was very kind, so I just let it go, but I think he still wanted a repeat performance. I felt very strange kissing him like that, but he didn't mind because he said that I was a very sexy girl.</p> <p>His cock was hard, and, as part of the invitation, he reached down and started to stroke it in front of me, so I went to him, and, when I was standing beside him, we both felt me.</p> <p>"That is really sexy," I said, smiling at him. "That's exactly what I really wanted, to kissâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
