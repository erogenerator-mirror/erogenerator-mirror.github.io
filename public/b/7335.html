My first reaction to her statement was that she meant that there was no telling what would develop, and that she could get fired. As was often the case, however, in the end she had a point. I did make an appointment to interview with a company attorney in a couple of minutes.</p> <p>About an hour later, I was waiting in my hotel room to call Julie to come to my office on Tuesday afternoon. When she arrived at my office we greeted each other like we had only known each other less and less. By the time she began to leave my office, she was standing directly in front me. "This is Dr. Morgan," she explained, "and please call me Marcia." She continued as though she didn't know who I was. "I'd like to talk with you about a few things before I leave tonight, but unfortunately my assistant is already in town. I hope you're not disappointed?"</p> <p>"Not at all, in fact I'm flattered. I think you've done a remarkable job, Julie." I took her hand and we both walked through the large hall into the outer area of my office. She sat down in my chair, leaned back, and spread her long legs and smiled as I sat down in front of her. "Julie, we're about to go into an all-out talk." She smiled up at me, "As in talk about the best ways we can share a good time?" She raised her eyebrows in questioning. "Oh yes, I'd like to discuss my marriage with some personal friends," I smiled. "Good afternoon, Marcia." "Good afternoon, Julie." I said, "I'll be watching where your eyes are going. I hope you realize that this is just a fling, and that you're obviously not in the mood to try and seduce me or my husband." "Marcia, Marcia," I responded, "this is just between us, not to do anything that would embarrass the three of us." "I agree, Marcia, I'm not in the mood to screw anything but the guy who happens to be in my bed and what happens between my bed and your bed is between me and your man. And what happens between me and your man is between him and me. I'm happy if it works out that way, so I hope you have fun."</p> <p>I continued to smile and said, "I also will be watching over all the young people you would be going to marry, so watch out if I call them before hand." "Great," she laughed "I'll make an announcement later. I need to get back to work, but you are welcome to hang out with me tonight. I hope that doesn't bother you for me to ask."</p> <p>"Marcia you're very kind, but your husband would think the same if he found out that you were engaged to another man"</p> <p>"And he's sure not going to stop you from going back to him?" and with that she got up, walked over to me, and put her arms around my neck. This was exactly the moment I felt like a predator, and could have had her at any time. In fact I was already starting to get very aroused just by looking at her. Her green eyes, long raven black hair that I loved to hold in my mouth and her beautiful lips and wonderfully soft, gentle touch. We started to kiss each other like the lovers we were. I could feel her hard nipples pressing against my chest. We broke our wet kiss and stood in front of each other for just a moment. Marcia's face was flushed and her breathing fast and shallow. I could see in her eyes that she was thinking very hard, not that it really mattered.</p> <p>As we continued to kiss it didn't seem that there was any longer. We finally broke our clinch. A tear ran down her cheek and I saw a smirk on her face. It was only when she opened her eyes that she reached down to my crotch and started to work on my shorts.</p> <p>"I've been dreaming of this moment since the other day," said Marcia, "all day, Marcia. I was afraid that if I came just looking at you I wouldn't get what I want. Just because I was in your office, I was afraid that you wouldn't be interested in me, no matter how much I enjoyed your attention. And you seem to think I'm a kind of sexy creature, don't you?" Marcia's hand was squeezing my cock and she could feel its hardness through my pants. I could feel my own excitement build and I tried to will myself back down and say, "You seem to be the only one that wants to beâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
