Your breasts are so nice. You're such a girl. I mean when I saw you at the airport this morning I always thought you were just as sexy as your brother."</p> <p>I was so glad I had decided to wear a blouse under the jeans, if the weather didn't turn out to be cold. With my husband's advice, I'd never wear any of the things she'd worn a couple of days prior. I liked his suggestions though, even at the expense of what little underwear I usually wore. I knew that it would be uncomfortable, I still had a few things to lose. Still, I guess I enjoyed my husband's suggestions, especially the way he treated me the day before.</p> <p>I put my arms around him and kissed him. "Don't worry honey, I'll behave after you leave tomorrow," he said and I hugged him tighter. It seemed like we'd only just made love some time ago and I didn't want to waste even one moment. But before he left I looked at me as if I was still waiting.</p> <p>"Are you sure you're still hungry? What you're wearing is so wrong," I said to him.</p> <p>"Oh no. This is perfect. I can't believe you picked a perfect dress for me to wear. It's so elegant."</p> <p>"Thank you kind sir," I said, "I thought it wouldn't hurt. I hope you like your new dresses."</p> <p>I made sure that my blouse was in place to show just a little of my breasts but left one button undone. The hem of the blouse was well above the knee. It didn't have much leg, just enough for my husband to get a close look at if he wanted. Of course, he didn't want to, the way he was looking at my. I looked better dressed than most and I had an image to fill in. I also wore something else. I knew I had on a pair of panties, and it made me feel a little self conscious. I don't really know how long I had it on when I went to the store. I didn't want to make it too obvious that I was completely naked under it, so I left them off and I had on a pair that were a little more conservative than the other one.</p> <p>I'd been hoping he was interested because it was fun to wear things like that, even if they were pretty short. I knew that he would have his hands all over me. But right now I wasn't sure if I was in trouble at dinner or if I was ready to have sex. But that thought wasn't important, I had enjoyed this as much as he had. As he walked toward me he asked, "So, are they a good size? Are they as fit as they look?"</p> <p>"Yes," I said, "although they're a little smaller than what I wear to the office here."</p> <p>"They look wonderful," he said as he held my hands to my waist. "I just like it when I walk and they are really nice legs. How about you?"</p> <p>I couldn't stop myself from smiling. "They're quite fine. The skirt looks great. And they do look a lot better on you than I could wear to a dinner party."</p> <p>He moved to a point where I could look at him to see where it was he was looking at. "There's something about a pretty girl that makes you want to do something adventurous," he said. "Is there?"</p> <p>"Yes, there is," I said as my head moved to his shoulder.</p> <p>"Have you ever really had sex before?" he asked.</p> <p>"No," I replied without thinking. "I don't know what it'd be like to do anything wild like that. I just want to do whatever I can to spice it up." I had never been that forward with a man before. If it was anything like what he was asking me, I liked it.</p> <p>"I can tell," he said. "I'll let you show me something tonight if it's not too difficult." It wasn't as if he had any sexual agenda, just that it seemed odd. He hadn't been with a married woman when he told me he would be bringing a girl home tonight. I wasn't sure if I wanted to go through with this. Maybe just a bit more playtime. We hadn't actually done anything like this before.</p> <p>"No, I won't," I replied. "I'm not quite ready for that yet, but I would love to try it. But now I just want to feel your hands all over me."</p> <p>As he led me to the bedroom he asked, "Would you like to feel my hand on you before we do this?"</p> <p>"No, really. I've never actually done anything like that, let aloneâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
