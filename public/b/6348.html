I repeated, my fingers already working furiously on my clit. "If you don't want me to fuck you I can just get up. I'm not going to hurt you."</p> <p>As I moved the toy from my pussy, it slipped out with a wet sound. I let go of my hair, now needing the friction as I walked to the sink to wash my hands. I had to pause, though, to put my hands on the counter. "You can't use up all the time in the world, you know," Anna said coldly, "and I will let it go."</p> <p>My head went back as I ran my hands over my breasts and began pinching my nipples. My hips squirmed slightly as I moved the toy to my clit. The vibrations from being in such a confined space was making me incredibly horny. I ran a hand down under my own breasts, playing with my nipples. Anna's voice echoed in my mind, but I couldn't hear where she was coming from. She was talking to me, or else I would have never thought that she could talk with a vibrator, let alone talk to me.</p> <p>As I stood up, my hands covered my sex, and I turned around. My legs ached from being so tightly clamped and stretched, but I found no relief and simply went to my dresser to pick out the vibrator, to take it out and bring it home. It was at that first moment that I finally realized that the best fuck of my entire life was about to be with Anna.</p> <p>With only moments to wait, I felt the dildo press against my pussy. It was slick, probably from some preparation, but not very thick either. If only the dildo got me to cum from just the slight nudge it was putting before I got on the first time. I could already feel myself becoming wetter and wetter as I continued playing with my breasts, letting loose of the toy and slipping an exploratory finger into my pussy. With one push of a finger, Anna shoved the toy inside of me. The combination of pleasure and pain was enough to keep going until it was half way inside me.</p> <p>My pussy walls gripped the toy even tighter. I leaned onto the edge of the tub and spread my legs slightly. Anna stood up behind me, her body pressed against my backside. She pushed the strap-on against me, rubbing it against the folds of my pussy. The sound of the dildo vibrating against the softness of my pussy made me buck against her, and I could feel her own breasts mashing up against my back. One of Anna's hands left my breast and slid down between my legs until she pressed down hard on my clit.</p> <p>"Oh fuck," I breathed in short bursts. The tension in my body had grown to a knot I never felt before. I was going to tell Anna to stop, because she would and she would hurt me, but it just wouldn't do.</p> <p>"What are you doing back there?" Anna asked, lifting up her hips to press a finger against my asshole. My hips were jerking upwards, and the dildo was moving inside me. I tried to moan, but my muffled cry was lost on the muffled sound of the shower water. And with all the force of a jackhammer, Anna suddenly slammed the last remaining inch of the toy into my pussy. "UUUNNHHH," I moaned, my back arching hard against Anna's hands and my body quivering and jerky. Her hips moved quickly and firmly against my ass as she came, causing me to push my ass back against hers as well.</p> <p>When we finished ourselves up, we wrapped our arms around each other, gently drying each other off. Anna stood before me, just staring at me. She turned and looked away from me as she looked around the room at the wall again. "You did a fantastic job tonight," she said.</p> <p>I felt guilty. If only she would've stayed the night. I felt guilty.</p> <p>I could still feel the pressure of the vibrator on my pussy, it's softness and friction was still there. As I stood up, Anna grabbed me from behind and lifted me to her, letting me wrap myself around her waist. Her hands found my breasts and she squeezed them. "So do you like my vibrator," she asked once I was standing.</p> <p>"It's fun," I smiled and pulled her hair. "But you know what I want to do with yours?"</p> <p>"As long as you keep doing that," she said, lifting me up until my nipples were at the edge of the tub. "Just remember to turn your head." I did as Anna asked, turning my head so she could place my mouth at my breasts. I let my mouth drop and began gently sucking first one, then the other, of her breasts, her nipples stillâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
