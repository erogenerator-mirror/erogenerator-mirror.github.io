I could use some help and coffee if you could. I'll see you in the morning, ok?"</p> <p>"Ok, by the way, how was work, darling?" I couldn't believe that she wanted to know about my sex life.</p> <p>"Good, I had such a great time getting rid of all those bad things I was carrying around and then it was a bit of a chore to just walk through the place and not see the sex scenes."</p> <p>"I just bet you are enjoying it. I can tell," I said with a wink.</p> <p>She giggled and kissed me one more time.</p> <p>"So, you want to do it again?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yep, I could probably get it up again in the morning but I have to call you, dear."</p> <p>"I'm sorry but I can't. I'm so excited right now, I can't hold it together any longer. I have to get back to work."</p> <p>I kissed her long and deep before I turned her around. I looked her closely one last time while she knelt in my lap. She looked up at me, "You are such a sweetie. I love you."</p> <p>"I love you too."</p> <p>She kissed me on the nose.</p> <p>"Now, I just want to make love to you again."</p> <p>I took a step back and grabbed her by the hand and dragged her back towards the bedroom. I pushed the door open and we stood in the middle of the room looking at each other. I knew she was just waiting for me after what we did at the end, and now she was ready. I started to unfasten her blouse when she looked up at me with fear and lust in her eyes.</p> <p>She stopped me. "You're right. Take it off."</p> <p>I undid her bra and it fell to the ground. I looked at her eyes and smiled. She had a beautiful, sweet smile.</p> <p>"Are you sure? You'll love it if you let me make love to you."</p> <p>"Let me make love to you?"</p> <p>"Yes, I want you to make love with me."</p> <p>"Ok, I promise I won't let you down. If you want it, let me give it." She gave me a big hug.</p> <p>My dick almost exploded at the thought of being buried between her legs and fucking her. "My god, you really are amazing."</p> <p>She started to undress herself. I watched her body as she removed all her clothes. She pulled off her panties, revealing a trimmed, neatly trimmed bush. She turned around to me. Our relationship was becoming a bit unusual, but we had been good friends that grew up together. I think she wanted me to know that her body was perfect. She was beautiful and fit. We both thought it was natural that we would be attracted to each other. She had a body that a man could die for.</p> <p>"You are wonderful, sweetheart."</p> <p>She kissed me on the cheek, smiled at me then bent down to take my already hard cock in her mouth. I started to feel the stirrings in my body as she sucked me off. It felt wonderful having her mouth on my cock. Her tongue was swirling around it like she wanted to tease me. It felt so good feeling her lips around it like it was a tiny cock. She let go of me once I was about half-way down her throat. She looked up at me. She opened her eyes and saw me looking at her with a lust in mine. I pulled her back up and kissed her deeply again. With our naked bodies pressed together, with our naked lips pressed together, our soft breasts pressed tightly together, my cock was pulsating in her mouth. She kissed me again and we just stood there kissing and rubbing our naked bodies against each other.</p> <p>"Oh, you know, you're too delicious to go back to work today," she said as she broke the kiss.</p> <p>"Oh, maybe, I don't know. Maybe we should. It would be a shame to have to leave so early and be late."</p> <p>"You can be my boss," she said and pushed her body back against mine once more.</p> <p>"I'm sure I can manage," I replied with a smile.</p> <p>Without her saying anything, I went about taking her clothes off again. I undid her bra which fell to the ground, she had perfect breasts, a little smaller than mine, perhaps C-cups, very full and firm. She sat back down again. Her body glowed in the room lights.
