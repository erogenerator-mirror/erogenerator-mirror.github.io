It was probably sometime around midnight, but it certainly didn't sound very long, like it always started before we fell asleep, and then started again. My first thought was that I must have fallen asleep because it was only after I was awake. The second thought came later as a thought on her part, not so loud and clear as she should be... The thought caused the last bit of the dream to come. I'm not sure that she ever remembers a dream like that, she might have it a hundred times. It made my mouth water to know that it would be her. Of course if there's even a chance that I ever dreamed it she may be my wife or my daughter. I don't know though if I know what it is. Perhaps that's her personality that makes her sexy. For sure I've seen her naked and I'm pretty sure of it.</p> <p>I'd rather that the subject was forgotten. It wasn't something that I really wanted to do, but the thought of her naked body in my hands caused me to start to feel a stir. A stirring that I never really felt in my life. I could see myself with my hands, which were now starting to move faster than my mind and trying to imagine what it would be like. It was a strange but enjoyable feeling, although when I thought about her naked body I was getting a slight erection, the feeling got so intense that I had to go to the bathroom or something to relieve myself.</p> <p>It was at this moment that she stopped, so the dream changed. It was after 2:30 in the morning and she came back to bed and sat there quietly for a few minutes. Then she took a blanket off to put between us and we snuggled together. She was wearing a robe and she seemed so relaxed and comfortable. The thought that she was already naked with me was all that would make it anything else, the very thought made me stir.</p> <p>I started to talk and she said, "You'll have to get me out of this robe."</p> <p>I could barely respond with the thought of being with my naked wife naked in bed. It was too much. I couldn't take that anymore. I had to have her. I took her in my arms and started to kiss her as I slipped my hand down to her naked body to feel her body with my arms. Her breathing was quick and shallow. I kissed her and my face felt the heat emanating from her. I moved my hand down her body to her pubic area and she responded with a start. I was about to push it down but she lifted her leg, leaving it on the bed and put it on the floor as she pulled my hand to her. All of a sudden I felt her lips on mine. I couldn't believe what I did next. My wife had her hand on my cock and I started to caress it with her hand. My hand slipped into her robe and there it was. It was a woman's hand on mine, she had her hands on my cock under the robe and it seemed to send a shock from the feel of her touching it. It seemed like an age before the feeling of her hand returned. As I explored the outline of her nipples with my fingers my hand slipped under the robe and touched her bare breast. I felt her nipple harden and move as her breathing deepened until she whispered, "I can't take that," and pulled my arm tighter around her torso. I could feel her pussy as I moved my fingers between her legs and that caused her to tense up. She was breathing heavy and I knew that she was still aching from waking up from her dream. My hand had slipped into her robe and I realized that she was also very turned on. With my fingers sliding into her pussy I was surprised and wet in my hand. She held my hand still, but I could feel her body tighten around me. I could feel the wetness of her and the warmth of her body as she held me in her arms and her breathing increased.</p> <p>Her hand on mine felt wonderful, she was obviously ready and my hand slid up and down her thighs. She had me now. All the rest of the night was gone. All that was left was the feeling, then her eyes started to open and she kissed me again and said, "I want to," and moved my fingers from her pussy to her clit. I stroked it gently and she started to rub back and forth on mine.</p> <p>"You sure know how to use your mouth."</p> <p>She looked at me with a big smile and pulled herself from me.</p> <p>After a moment I started to feel dizzy again, I was really tired now. I hadn't wanted to do that to Linda, it was too late. I could feel her fingers moving on my own as she moved her body between my legs, her fingers were now stroking my cock very gently. I could feel the heat of her bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
