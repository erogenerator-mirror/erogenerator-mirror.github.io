"It's a good feeling to be in the middle of something."</p> <p>"I know," said John and Joe.</p> <p>"I feel good too, but it still hurts," said Debbie.</p> <p>"It only hurts if it's got a good thing to give, Debbie." added Dave.</p> <p>"We've got to take care and clean-up before dinner." said John. "We're sorry for the trouble we caused, but it wasn't easy walking home, and a good part of being with us."</p> <p>Debbie smiled. "I feel so much for you, Dave."</p> <p>At breakfast, they said goodbye and headed for the door. With a couple of hours of planning to get back, they got back on the road and wound their way home.</p> <p>They had about an hour before they had to turn around. The wind blew their hair off their faces and let it blow through their coats, and Deb noticed that a few drops of rain had formed on her breasts. They were dressed in the most casual clothing they had. John carried out the rest of the dishes and then Debbie helped him, and they shared a kiss while the rain soaked their wet hair.</p> <p>"Let's change clothes, we can run if we want." She said in her best singlet, while John put the dirty towel in the laundry dryer.</p> <p>They went to the bedroom in the back, stripped and tossed their coats on the bed. "I think we might need to change," said Debbie when they were half-way there.</p> <p>"Not just yet." said John as he started to step into the wet clothes, trying not to lose any of the luster he was wearing in the wet. He wasn't sure just how wet he had been in front, but it looked like his dick was dry. He tried not to think about how it had got hard, but his body, especially his dick was starting to get uncomfortable. He didn't know why, but it didn't bother him that much.</p> <p>"Ready?" asked Debbie.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah, go for it," said John and they ran out to the shower as John pulled the door up behind them and then shut it. They both looked back at him with a confused look of confusion, and then went in to change.</p> <p>When they were both ready, they took their coats off and then helped each other out of their shoes. Both of them were covered in a light wet t-shirt and clean pants.</p> <p>"I hope you have something special for us to wash." said Debbie. "We're getting so wet from the rain. I wouldn't want to get dehydrated."</p> <p>"Honey, your pussy's soaking, and you look beautiful in it." said John.</p> <p>"I still feel bad that I got you horny."</p> <p>John gave her a quick kiss and said, "It's okay, really."</p> <p>"I love you, honey." replied Debbie. "We can talk about our husbands for a little while, if you want."</p> <p>"I know, I didn't mean for all of this to happen to me. I didn't want the rain to be coming down." John replied.</p> <p>"I understand. I was hoping that your clothes would be better than wet ones."</p> <p>"They're not wet."</p> <p>"No, but it's not raining so much as it's dry."</p> <p>"But dry. That's pretty wet underwear."</p> <p>"It's not that, it's dry. And it's not like being outside in the rain."</p> <p>"I feel better now anyway." said Debbie.</p> <p>Debbie got all wet, not to mention her nipples, and then helped John clean himself up. The wet t-shirt was a little warm on her arms and she could feel the warmth of the towel against her body, but when John started to do his job, she reached in to try to help.</p> <p>John took his time, trying not to think of how it felt to clean an entirely different pussy up, while Debbie helped clean themselves up.</p> <p>When he was done, it seemed like it was impossible to get the water out of the soaked clothes without getting it soaking wet. Both of them were still soaked from the rain, but Debbie helped John dry his hair, and then they took the wet tee shirt and tee off themselves.</p> <p>"We've got to hurry, don't want to get soaked, and then not get clean." said Debbie.</p> <p>"I can go put some dry clothes on, if it's okay with you." said John.</p> <p>"No you don't. I don't want to keep you in the rain. I'll just wash the clothes."</p> <p>Debbie openedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
