"I won't be, or ever be, a part of that." I felt the tears start again, but they stopped. The pain I'd been feeling at the hands of the guys at the party just faded away, leaving the ache inside of me to take a new form. I felt as if the tears were trying to drip down my face.</p> <p>I turned to my left, and sat with the men and girls who'd been there. I turned towards my right. "I love you, my friend," I said. My voice was soft, yet firm, and a little shaky. I was proud of myself, the girls were trying to keep their heads together, but some of the guys in front of them were grinning. The men were nodding in agreement. "I think I love you too, my love."</p> <p>My mouth dropped open, and I dropped my head back - and I didn't even realize that I'd just dropped it all. For some strange reason, the shame I felt now was indescribable, and it was all the more poignant to me. I was a total fool for letting this happen, and I knew I wouldn't ever again feel the passion of a woman. But now, when I'm on the dance floor, in a corner of this room, you can't beat that beautiful song. I couldn't deny it, now, that I felt even more shame - just as much as a part of me felt the power of feeling the passion of lust.</p> <p>I didn't see the guys in front of me. In my peripheral vision, I could still see a man moving towards me, but he was blocking my path. When I turned again, he was looking at me, but I could still make out the expression on his face - like he was going to say something that would hurt me.</p> <p>"What's wrong, Ryan?" he said softly.</p> <p>"I feel like shit."</p> <p>I stared at him for a minute before saying, "Look, I know it's not okay to be a woman, and I know that it's not really that often, and it isn't really that often. I know it's hard to say this, but sometimes, the fear is so intense that it is impossible to even say these things. And I can't imagine how many guys feel that way about their wives, either. That's not exactly something I like about you. So do you feel like taking a walk now? Let's call it a night, okay? It will just take a few minutes. Just to get to sleep. I feel a little dizzy. I think it would be better to just say that we're going home, and maybe go for a walk."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>We took the elevator back to my room, and I sat down on the bed. I hadn't really thought about it, or why the guys seemed like they had. I just assumed that they were looking for ways to make me feel better. It was obvious that I wasn't feeling better, but it was also clear to me that the thought was a part of the thrill I felt, more than the actual sex. I'd lost myself in the moment, and I realized that I felt good.</p> <p>After only a minute more of sitting on my bed, or maybe a minute more of sleeping, I got up, threw on some clothes, and headed to the elevator. When I got there, I looked over at the guys, and they all just stared at me. I sat down on the elevator's steps.</p> <p>"What's up, Ryan? Are you feeling okay? Are you feeling better? Do whatever you need to do to make your peace with the whole thing?"</p> <p>I looked over at the people in the elevator. All of them were smiling at me. I felt a wave of relief pass through me. "I'm all right, Ryan."</p> <p>"Good, good."</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yeah," I said. "Do whatever you need to do to make peace with me." I sat back down on the elevator. I could feel the warmth and confidence returning to me, with the rest of my body. It was obvious this time that it had all been an amazing evening. I felt like I was back in high school - the college girls and boys that had followed me around for an evening in the locker room. I didn't even feel like I should feel this way.</p> <p>"I guess I should take some pictures for posterity."</p> <p>"No," I said. "You're not seeing much of me, you know. I'm just going to grab a beer and hit this bar. I still don't feel the need to have a drink every now and then."</p> <p>"I've got all the beers," he pointed out.
