I could almost feel my lips parting as he teased each nipple with his teeth. I moaned and arched my back, feeling my pussy throb. Suddenly it was too much and I was about to cum. I rolled over onto my side, trying to rub my hand down into my pussy, but he was on top of me, his dick slipping up into me. I felt him lift up and turn me. He pressed me down on the bed. I was so turned on that I could even feel myself cumming. I reached between us to find him still hard and I wrapped my legs around him. He thrust into me as he thrust, harder and deeper. I felt myself cum again and started squeezing him. He started thrusting even harder himself, feeling me cum.</p> <p>I laid there for a second, reveling in the power he had over me. I was just about to tell him to leave when I felt his fingers slip down to my pussy and start rubbing my clit. I started shaking on the bed and he started thrusting harder. It was too much and I started cumming again, my pussy pulsing around his dick, milking him. After I recovered, he rolled off the bed and went into the bathroom. When he came out, I lay there in my panties, breathing a little ragged.</p> <p>He saw my expression and smiled, putting his hand down to his face and smelling my perfume, then moved over closer and kissed me on the lips, his fingers inside my panties, exploring me once again. He kissed me while he was moving his fingers in and out of me, my legs spread open with them. I felt his cock hard and hard against me. It felt huge even though he could easily get as much of his fingers inside me. I put my hand down so he could slip a couple of fingers inside me, his own hand playing with my pussy while both his hands moved over me. I knew we both were playing with ourselves and that both of us getting aroused. We kissed again, a little tongue and a little exploring, and he slipped back into his clothes to leave. The next thing I knew, he was on top of me, his cock between my legs, and I was kissing him again. He didn't stop, we just kept kissing for a while, kissing and caressing each other. His hand was kneading at my breast again, feeling me through my blouse. I leaned back and he slipped my blouse off, then lifted my skirt. I felt his hand slip underneath my panties, rubbing his fingers over my pussy before sliding a finger into my pussy, sliding it out again. I arched my back, my head thrown back, and he kissed me, whispering how much he loved kissing me and how hot and wet I was, he could feel my pussy on his finger. He kissed his way down to my breasts, licking and nipping at my nipples as he slipped my panties off, tossing them across the bed with the rest of my clothes. I didn't care where they went when he came back to kiss me. He stopped when he got to my pussy and licked, then started licking my clit again. I was about to reach out and have him take my nipples between his teeth again when I felt his finger slide into my pussy again, sliding in and out. I could feel every centimeter of his finger, and he pushed it in and out, fucking me. I felt he was close and opened my eyes to see him holding me down with his other hand while he sucked my breasts. My eyes were closed, enjoying this new sensation. His tongue was moving over my clit, rubbing it with his hand while his finger fucked me.</p> <p>He let my nipple slip from his mouth and started using one finger to slowly run along my pussy, then sliding it in again. He slipped one finger into my pussy and I felt him slide it in and out. He fingered me for a while, sliding his finger in and out and flicking it back and forth to get the most out of the situation. His finger rubbed against my g-spot and I couldn't help myself from opening my eyes again to watch him. Suddenly, he stopped, pulling his hand out of my pussy and sliding up between my legs so he could kiss me.</p> <p>That kiss, it had been so long between us, it brought me to orgasm, and I came so hard that my whole body went to shake. He just slid up me from behind, my legs still draped over his, and kissed me again as he slid his hands up and down, feeling the length of my body. We kissed for a while before he slid up to lie beside me. I felt his fingers again slip inside meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
