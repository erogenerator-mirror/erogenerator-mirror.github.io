"Are you going to come again?"</p> <p>"I'm not sure," he replied, smiling, "although I'll bet we do it once before the game."</p> <p>"Let's make it hard to remember next time," she said with a smile.</p> <p>They both agreed; she made him wear just a towel from the pool, which got soaked and stung. He held her and played with the little bits of sun-bleed that had fallen along her arms.</p> <p>"What about my dress?" he wondered.</p> <p>With a shake of her head she pulled the material apart, revealing the tight, clinging fabric.</p> <p>"I suppose you'll need a bra," he said, "I could get you a dress,"</p> <p>"I want you to," she replied. "Just put one on."</p> <p>His eyes glazed over as he unfastened the bra and slipped it off to the side.</p> <p>"Very nice," he murmured as he bent and sucked a nipple into his mouth.</p> <p>She squealed and pulled on his hair, pulling his mouth down to her breast.</p> <p>"Come and show me," he said, "And let me show you something else."</p> <p>With that he quickly knelt on the towel, lifted her legs, and rubbed warm oil all up her thighs. She closed her eyes and gasped, pushing her tits toward him.</p> <p>"Do it," she breathed, grabbing his hair and pulling on it. "Please do it."</p> <p>She pushed his hand away. "No, let me. I do it."</p> <p>"Okay," he said tentatively.</p> <p>He ran his hands up her thighs, over her bum and up to the small of her back. He pulled his fingers up through her crack and felt how wet she was, and he felt an urgent need for her to pull him inside. She raised her legs and he knelt between them, holding her hips as he lowered her onto his waiting rod.</p> <p>"Oh God, that really feels good," she gasped as he slid the whole length inside her.</p> <p>His cock slid into her again and with a groan he thrust again and again, almost breaking off the rhythm as he felt each ridge of his shaft.</p> <p>"Oh, that's a good boy," she whispered, "Fuck me, fuck me and make me come again."</p> <p>After a pause he reached down and took her breasts to his mouth, sucking one and then the other as he thrust again and again.</p> <p>"Now it's my turn," she whispered urgently as she pushed herself against his thrusts. "Fuck me again."</p> <p>He knew he couldn't last too long. He thrust hard once more, then as his body began to twitch he thrust as hard as he could again, and held tight onto her until then that was a sign they had reached a peak of ecstasy and he let out a strangled cry as he spurted deep inside her.</p> <p>Exhausted, they lay side by side for a few minutes, trying to catch their breath.</p> <p>"That was amazing," she murmured after a minute or so, staring into his face. "What do you do?"</p> <p>"How about you?"</p> <p>For a moment they lay there, until her hand had wandered along his thigh.</p> <p>"Would you like to come again?" she asked. "I'm still wearing the dress."</p> <p>"That'd be fabulous," he answered, still trembling. "But I am having a little trouble remembering the rules of the game."</p> <p>"The one you had with you earlier," she continued. "I want you to follow my lead."</p> <p>He smiled at her. "No game?"</p> <p>"Only that," she said with a laugh. "Not tonight; I'll keep the dress just in case."</p> <p>*****************************</p> <p>Several hours later there were two people playing "I Dream of Jeannie" on the stage.</p> <p>"I love this one," Bill said with a frown as the otherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
