Then he kissed her mouth, slowly, sensuously, not knowing what she expected him to do next. Their kiss was short but deep, long, and passionate. Their bodies pressed close together as they shared the passion they were feeling by having their first kiss. Their tongues danced together as their hands touched, stroked, and caressed each other. It was as if she was melting into him, unable to stop herself, wanting more and more as it continued.</p> <p>When they stopped kissing they stood there holding each other as breath came in quick shallow inhalations. He finally broke the long kiss, gazing at her smiling face, knowing that he knew her so well. "You have no idea how wonderful what we did could be with a little patience," he said softly.</p> <p>They had talked about this after their experiences with the truckers the first time the truckers had rented a motel room to go to the bathroom and then wait for the truckers to come out of their bathroom and they would all have a beer. This was a first time for them to talk so they agreed, in a matter of minutes what they were about to do next would be very special for both of them. It was going to be a very special evening, they had talked long hours about his future, and were eager to find out what they might get that day. They broke apart, holding each other with arms locked tightly around each other, feeling each other. "How can I ever thank you?" she whispered. "Can't you teach me?"</p> <p>He just nodded his head slowly while he gently squeezed her bottom with his hand. "Do you mean that?" he asked as he lifted his finger and ran it across her bottom lip.</p> <p>"God, I have never been with a man before. It scares me to know I'm even thinking of doing this," she said softly as she watched him with a smile. "I am so excited that I can even tell my husband has never seen anything like this. And you? Oh, I don't know how many women have ever talked about this before. I hope I don't have to tell my husband. It is so wonderful."</p> <p>"Trust me, I'll talk to him about all this," he said with a laugh. They walked slowly back to the van. After opening the doors, he handed her the keys, and turned to leave her with him standing there. "I've never seen a thing like this," was all he said. "There has to be something special about you," she whispered again, and they kissed again as he led her to the van and locked it up.</p> <p>"Do you have your purse?" she said as the van began moving back toward the motel.</p> <p>"I got it," he teased as he turned to walk toward the motel door. "Let me give you the key for taking care of the truck and let you get into the room when you come out of the bathroom."</p> <p>"You think?" she asked as she saw him holding a small bag, not the very real "bag" of his fantasy in hand. "You've already seen a lot!" she said excitedly as she followed him to the door.</p> <p>"I wanted to make sure you were comfortable," he told her as he slipped the key in the door. "You are so incredibly beautiful and so feminine," he said with a slight blush in his voice that she could not get out of, so as to not appear too obvious about how he affected her.</p> <p>"I'll bet you were wondering if your legs were a bit tanned out," he said with a small laugh, but with a smile.</p> <p>"That isn't how I was feeling," she answered shyly. "I was just thinking that I would love to see if they didn't make a lot of difference if I got a little sun on them," she added laughing a bit and then a bit more seriously as she looked him in the eye and saw a glimmer in his eyes that seemed to tell her something.</p> <p>"Yes, they did make a lot of difference, but now I'm not so sure that is going to be enough," he said with a grin. "It is time for me to go home."</p> <p>"I know," she said as she picked up her purse and keys and headed out of the van.</p> <p>"I'm just leaving," he told her, "but we'll check in in a couple of hours if that's ok," he added as he watched her hand purse slowlyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
