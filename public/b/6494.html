"Is it okay?"</p> <p>"Of course. I'm sorry. I had to ask. I wanted to go over what we discussed before. I didn't think it was wise to be so harsh."</p> <p>Candi nodded. "I know. I have the problem."</p> <p>"What is the problem?" I asked carefully.</p> <p>"I just don't know."</p> <p>"And you never talked to me about it?"</p> <p>"Never. Why?"</p> <p>"Do you know why you wanted to talk and come out here alone?"</p> <p>"Yes, but..."</p> <p>"No. You can't talk about this with me." I turned my back on her and pulled my phone out of my pocket. "Just remember, I'll be back in a few minutes to get your confession. But, please forgive my forwardness about asking you to forgive me right now." I put in the app and turned away.</p> <p>"I'll be there in a few minutes."</p> <p>A few minutes later, I felt as if I were running a marathon. While doing so, I heard her open the door and let her in. She was in a t-shirt and shorts, and she came into my arms. "I've got to go. I have to go. I have to get back to the condo."</p> <p>"Are you going to be gone for a couple of days?"</p> <p>"I wasn't intending to. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. It's just so sudden and unexpected." She kissed my cheek. "I'm sorry."</p> <p>"No, I'm going to ask you again. Please forgive me."</p> <p>"If I didn't forgive myself? Do you still love me?"</p> <p>"You'll see in a moment." She kissed me on the lips, then turned and left. I thought she may have come back for me when she said, 'Love you too.'</p> <p>Several minutes later, she came back at me, kissed me, and said, "Goodnight, Tom."</p> <p>I nodded and waited for her to walk out of the door. A few seconds later, another woman walked by and asked, "Goodnight, Mom." A moment later, I was lying in bed, naked, naked, and tired. "I just wanted to give Tom some time with me."</p> <p>"So you'd rather not..."</p> <p>I didn't hear her. When I awoke, I was still lying naked in the bed. I looked around the room of my apartment. I remembered that no one had brought me any clothes. Candice must have spent the night in her apartment alone. She didn't even know I was in my room; she assumed I had left her stuff in my apartment. I wasn't sure I could forgive her.</p> <p>"Well, I guess I'll get off my feet now and call her. But, before you do what you just did, tell me again why you're here. If you really want a divorce, then you would be welcome to come in here this weekend and we can go over our future together. After all, you aren't leaving me."</p> <p>I didn't have a chance. The other woman was already on her way out the door.</p> <p>"The only thing I could do was try to find out what Tom will do for a living."</p> <p>"Maybe you don't have to. I understand if he doesn't feel that way."</p> <p>"No. That would be too bad of a deal. What would be the best way to do that?"</p> <p>"The best way is to see Tom, and let him know you're coming tomorrow at nine."</p> <p>"Good night, Mom. I'll see you tomorrow."</p> <p>For the next couple of hours, I looked at myself in the mirror, thinking about what I'd said the night before. "Yes, you are right. I think I won't be as able to tell him any particular thing."</p> <p>I left the bathroom and walked over to the couch. "You might want to go put on something a little more comfortable." I walked around the coffee table until I came to a coffee table and put on coffee and a pastry.</p> <p>After pouring myself a cup, I sat on the couch, and then tried to think of what to say. "Mom, do you think Tom will forgive you this weekend?"</p> <p>"Tom is on the phone with her. I told him she needed advice."</p> <p>"I told her you'd be home on the weekends. I guess she has that to thank for that."</p> <p>"It did, and I'll do it again when I get to work Monday. I'm glad we're on our own."</p> <p>"Do you think heâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
