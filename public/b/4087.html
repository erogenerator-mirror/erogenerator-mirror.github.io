She was breathing hard, her chest rising and falling. Her nipples were hard and very dark. She was biting them and pulling on them while rubbing her pussy furiously on me.</p> <p>I couldn't hold much more. I lifted myself up on the chair on my elbows and held her by the waist with both hands under the ass, pulling her onto my shaft. She was screaming, "oh, so good. I'm so horny." I felt her body tighten around my waist with her legs squeezing me so tightly I knew she could cum in me. Her pussy tightened even more around me. I felt her cumming. Our bodies were shaking and we were both exhausted. We had stopped breathing, but kept fucking each other until we stopped.</p> <p>We lay there, both exhausted and smiling, my cock lying along her legs, still inside her, slowly shrinking. She had come a lot more. Her body hair still stuck out over her breasts. After a while, I pulled my cock out of her and stood up. I picked up the dresser again. I bent over to pick it up.</p> <p>"Well, honey, why don't you wear that in front of all these kids. Then you can wash it off and make me feel guilty about what happened," I said to her. I stood on tip toe and kissed her, sucking on her lip before moving my lips along hers until we were once again at tongue height.</p> <p>We had only kissed a couple of times now. It was a really strange experience. And I wanted to make love to her again. I wanted to take all her virginities and make her mine. I had wanted to make love to this girl again. Now it was the same thing. I had to force the passion to go slow. I wanted her to feel sexy, I wanted her to give me pleasure in her innocence.</p> <p>She made me stand right next to her, and we kissed for long minutes. It didn't stop there. We started kissing and sucking each other's tongues and I felt her hands on my ass. She started to caress me, squeezing the cheeks of my ass and running her fingernails over the small of my back. It was still dark outside, but I didn't care. I was completely helpless.</p> <p>We kissed for another minute, and then we separated. She kissed my face and my ears, and then her lips closed around mine once more, kissing her gently. I thought I heard a moan come from her as we were kissing.</p> <p>"Honey, it's so nice, I love you," she whispered. She was still wearing the dress, and there was still the white bra over my breast. I liked it, too. It fit her figure like a glove, and it felt so good to be inside her again.</p> <p>"I love you too, honey, so we just have to do this again," I said, kissing her on her mouth slowly, and gently biting her lips again. We then separated again, and I held her close to me, we kissed each several more time. We had made love again in just this kind of darkness in the night. Then we lay down and we kissed.</p> <p>We both wanted some more of each other. I didn't know how, or with what we were doing. We got undressed again, then we kissed once more. Slowly, slowly, we made out. First our tongues got into each other's mouth, then our lips and our lips together. Then we licked each other's lips one last time. Our lips were so soft and yet so moist. Her tongue flicked between my lips before we separated.</p> <p>Then we kissed again. I kissed her neck while we were kissing each other. Her skin felt so soft. I felt it. She didn't seem to care and started to fondle my breasts. I felt so sexy and her lips felt so good. Both of us were breathing really heavily, so hard. I felt her hands caressing mine, fondling me and caressing me.</p> <p>"Oh, my, it feels so good," I moaned.</p> <p>"This girl really is a dream," I thought, still kissing her. I put my hands under hers as much as I could and started caressing her breasts. She still wore the bra, but it wasn't really see-through; it wasn't see-through at all. Then her hands went all over my breasts. She wanted me to take them away so I wouldn't touch them completely. She squeezed so tight. They felt soft, and had a nice shape; like a big softball. The feel of her breasts was so sensual and erotic too. I enjoyed my own little touch. It was as if she'd told me that she didn't want to hurt me. Her hands continued to squeeze, feel, rub, and rub my breasts. I felt so turnedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
