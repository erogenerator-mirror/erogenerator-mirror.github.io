He'd been on the phone for quite some time.</p> <p>"Of course I am and I would love to play the game."</p> <p>"OK, I'll tell him you're available and bring his bag!"</p> <p>"OK, bye."</p> <p>She took hold of the phone and was about to ring off, when his voice came through again.</p> <p>"Good bye, I'm in England on business."</p> <p>So there you have it I'll be back in ten minutes and we won't have to get up and leave it until morning. He's all yours babe!</p> <p>Oh and I want you to stay dressed and ready for me until he comes.</p> <p>Just do your best, bye!"</p> <p>She was getting into getting naked just now and quickly slipped her panties off and then sat on the edge of the bed just as he walked into the room.</p> <p>"I'm sorry! This is so embarrassing." he said.</p> <p>"It's OK my love! I never did that in my life!" She smiled sweetly at him as she finished getting dressed.</p> <p>'That was the last of my time with Tom and I'll enjoy the next time."</p> <p>"I'm ready to go," she said.</p> <p>"But it might be a while before we can go!" he joked.</p> <p>"Well yes it will be for you but not too long."</p> <p>"Oh don't worry, and we'll have plenty of time for that."</p> <p>"OK, see you later." They both walked to the door and she rang off. She had really put out a good impression with the way she dressed and she hoped the way she looked would do the trick. She did make sure she had her jewellery on the way home and her outfit was ready once she'd left him to get to the office.</p> <p>In the time it took him to get to the office, her mobile rang and it was him.</p> <p>"What's up hun?" he asked.</p> <p>She giggled.</p> <p>"I've booked a flight back to London for the next day and I got a great opportunity with the big company I have! They're expecting me this afternoon."</p> <p>She had been wearing something of a hurry since the game and wanted to be sure she made the right decision.</p> <p>She gave him a quick kiss on the cheek.</p> <p>"See you at home."</p> <p>'I hope it's on your side." he said.</p> <p>"I hope it's on your side too!" she replied with a smile.</p> <p>But now it was time to pay the bill and get into the house. She put the key back into the door and then she picked up her bag and took off again.</p> <p>She arrived and went back in the lounge and sat down on the sofa.</p> <p>"Have a seat, I want to tell you a little bit about myself!" she told him.</p> <p>He sat down in the chair beside her.</p> <p>"Well for over eight hours I've been looking forward to the game, but I was also looking forward to spending time with you!"</p> <p>She looked very excited, like a cat at a mouse she was excited.</p> <p>"Well let's start by having a drink."</p> <p>She reached into her bag and fumbled around to see what she'd got.</p> <p>"Oh! You've got some of these!"</p> <p>"'Bout what?" he asked.</p> <p>"Oh just some teas, a little something to keep you excited." She handed him a glass of lemonade.</p> <p>He put the mangoes on a plate and she took the lemonade and mixed them all in with a big spoonful of cold water and they made the drink together.</p> <p>After the first sip she took out his glass which she handed back and then said.</p> <p>"What about my new lingerie? I thought you wanted to see it!"</p> <p>"I did! Where do you want me to put it," he asked, he'd been wondering.</p> <p>"I think you'd better put it on and show him what it looks like before you go and get me in the middle of it and then you can take it off when you're ready!" She grinned.</p> <p>He reached out and opened her negligee. She had on nothing underneath as he pulled it over her head. They kissed again as he started to massage them as his fingers caressed her breasts. Her breathing got a little faster as he started to feel her nipples. He put his hand round each and started gently squeezing and rubbing her. She pulled her knees apart and he started to push into them, pushing them further apart. Then he moved his kisses to her neck as she took a nipple in her mouth andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
