I was already planning to put this pretty pretty woman to sleep and I knew she would wake up with a smile, if she got a good look. I took her hand and we walked together down the hallway to my room. I quickly pulled her into my arms and we kissed, my tongue slipping into hers in a way she loved.</p> <p>In my room we began to make out as our hands massaged each other’s bodies. Her fingers roamed across my hard cock as I took off my shirt and threw it to the side. We were soon in each others' arms. This is what she had been waiting for. For me to slide my erection into those soft wet and warm depths was going to be difficult. But I had to know what she would do once I was inside of her or I would end up breaking the promise we made one evening a week ago that I couldn’t keep. There was no way of knowing how she might respond. I slowly moved the head of my dick down the outer lips of her slit and then slowly pushed into her.</p> <p>“Mmmmmm….” she moaned softly. I held myself close to the front of the bed so I could hold her and watch her face as I began to slowly and methodically slide my dick inside of you. At first her body relaxed and she began thrusting her hips back at me with a desire I could only imagine. Her eyes still met mine and with the slightest of smiles she asked, “Fuck me with your dick.” That was all the encouragement I needed. My hands moved up underneath her legs to her ass, lifting them up until I was able to enter her fully and begin plunging my throbbing erection deep into her. She was still looking into my eyes as I took her in and began driving my cock all the way inside of you before beginning the cycle again in slow long strokes.</p> <p>We were both panting as I lifted her ass up and down to meet each thrust of both our bodies. I moved my hands up to her shoulders and began pulling at them, encouraging her to stay at the point of complete release. I had had the same effect. With my left hand I reached down and began rubbing her clit with my thumb, her hips thrust toward me at the same time I began to thrust my hardness into her. Her moans filled the room as she held me tight against her body and cried out my name. Her body began to jerk as her entire universe centered on the center of her being while her body seemed to spasm under me with incredible intensity. As her entire body convulsed with a single aftershock I knew she was going to either cum for me, or for us together. Just as I was about to decide this fact I felt her climax begin to peak. I slowed my motion as it began and I wanted our moment together to last as long as possible. Her body continued to convulse for what seemed like minutes until it subsided and she was slowly falling down onto her back. I knew that her legs would not move to hold her up so I slowly pulled herself off of him, turned her around and placed her down, face up, to face me. She was once again staring into both my eyes with her mouth hanging open. My heart was suddenly racing as I placed my hands on her and moved her body to the end of my bed.</p> <p>She was on her back now, her knees up and spread wide. My eyes moved from her face to her crotch so that I could look down her. Her head was turned and her eyes closed, her mouth forming a smile while her lips pursed and her tongue licked her lips. I watched for a few moments, then I slowly moved my dick down toward her, watching the muscles in her stomach contract in anticipation as I drew up against her mound for my final destination. The very tip of the head of my dick was just teasing her clit as I watched her face and eyes. I slowly lowered myself onto her body as her legs moved up my body to wrap around my hips. I pushed myself deep inside of her one more time and waited.</p> <p>Her body convulsed under me then slowly relaxed as I began moving my hips in a circle again. The head of my dick was still pressed into her as the heat of her walls seemed like it was on fire waiting for me to continue. My movements were slow at first, allowing my cock to become coated with her juices. I then began to gently begin to thrust myself with my hips, my swollen tip bumping against the bottom of her cervix. She moaned as each inch of my cock moved within her.
