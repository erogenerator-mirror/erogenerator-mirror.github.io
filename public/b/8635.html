"Ohhh. That feels so nice."</p> <p>She does something else and starts licking me all over again; the inside of my thighs, the top of my lips and on to my crotch. She does this for a while and I can honestly feel myself getting to the point of no return. With my hand now down my panties I move my middle finger over my clitoris and that's all it takes to trigger what's next.</p> <p>As she does what she's doing at that moment, I lean against her and raise my legs into the air. She goes with this and takes me to a higher level and I can feel myself trembling and losing control of myself. Not wanting to be caught off guard, I bring my hand to her mouth to lick. It's all the way down her neck and over her shoulders. She leans forward, lifts up my left hip and then does something I have no idea what at the moment, but I don't care. I keep my eyes closed while she's licking me up and down like a snake in a bowl of honey. I try my best not to moan because the more I do it, the better it feels.</p> <p>By this point my pussy is so sensitive it feels like it'll never stop throbbing. She licks me like I've never been licked before. It's all in and out of my hand again. She's got both hands between my legs now and is pressing my butt with a sense of purpose. I'm feeling like a crazed animal as I continue to rub myself on her face.</p> <p>With my hand over her head, I start kissing her, thrusting my tongue into her sweet mouth. I'm on a roll from the sensations of her tongue. She moans into my mouth and then bites mine again as she starts fingering me as well. I put my hand around her neck and put it in the middle of her chest while doing the same thing on her other nipple.</p> <p>"Oh, oh, oh," I moan repeatedly. "Oh, oh, oh!" I am bucking and moving now all around the bed. It feels like I'm floating now.</p> <p>I can feel a sensation coming up from my crotch. The pressure is building in my stomach now with each second, but the feeling inside my belly is more intense than anything I've felt before. My head is pounding from it and I don't care.</p> <p>I feel like I might float down into the world at any minute, like I'm going to lose control and have an orgasm before it even gets started. It's not.</p> <p>I keep my eyes open and stare at the ceiling. My arms and legs are all tied tight to the bed frame. "I'm going to cum, I'm going to pass out!" I scream into the darkness. It doesn't get past me. I keep seeing stars, but just get closer.</p> <p>"You're going to pass out right now, aren't you?" She's moaning into my mouth.</p> <p>I feel faint. It feels as if I have a light being switched on in the middle of it all and I don't know if I feel a vibration that is sending a surge of energy through my body and then all the darkness is gone. I'm completely, utterly dead.</p> <p>She's right next to me on the bed now, she's not moving but keeps fingering me. Her eyes close and she begins to moan louder and louder and as I start to come she bites my bottom lip. I just lose it as I come.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm cumming," I scream at once and I get my back to her, but her hand on my mouth holds her back. I can feel it. I feel the pulses, and I know it's going to be one big orgasm. I want her to hold me, but can't let go of her because now I'm not hers. No more.</p> <p>She gets me to open my eyes and when she does my nipples are being bitten by a chain so I just go limp. We're both gasping and trembling like dead people.</p> <p>It takes a while, but finally I'm able to go to my arms and my legs and finally stand.</p> <p>"That was amazing," she says as she stands right next to me. She has her hands on her head and is looking at me with wide eyes. Then she puts her hand into my hair and pulls my face to kiss me. I wrap my arms around her waist and pull her back against me as we kiss.</p> <p>"I didn't think you'd cum that much," I say. "That was amazing."</p> <p>"There's more to come," she purrs. "I want you to do the things that you did in high school."</p> <p>"I think I can do that," I say, still in awe of herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
