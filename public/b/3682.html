It's good to be out there. And I'm sure she would have done the same if this weren't so busy." The woman smiled.</p> <p>The man nodded back and chuckled. "I could call her the next time I see her. We would be much more comfortable out in one of our quieter bars." The woman chuckled.</p> <p>"I agree. So is that what you want to do? Just go back into the club and see how many people there really are."</p> <p>"I think so," the man grinned. "Perhaps we should try out a line on this place."</p> <p>The woman nodded. "I'll call a friend," she told him, and she hung up.</p> <p>***********</p> <p>I sat on an overstuffed chair, staring through the bar's windows into a crowd of couples and children. The crowd was small, maybe six tables down from my own little bar, and the crowd was thick in the way it could get crowded. A couple of women were sitting just outside the bar's window, and I recognized them as they were in the midst of a conversation, drinking and laughing.</p> <p>But they were different; they were no longer my friends, they were strangers and not just customers who were in a strange place with an unusual man. As their conversation went on, their eyes moved from my face down to my lap. The two women at the window glanced nervously at me.</p> <p>"Are you okay?" the man asked.</p> <p>I smiled.</p> <p>"I've just been a bit overwhelmed by all the people here," I said.</p> <p>He shook his head.</p> <p>"The best place in town," I guessed.</p> <p>He looked surprised.</p> <p>"I mean, what happened with you and your date?" the man asked.</p> <p>"It was nothing, really!" I said defensively. "It was a little strange. I don't think the whole town knows about our date." I was trying to get the man to laugh.</p> <p>"So it must be, and it's not something you do often." I shrugged.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want to go through with this?" he said, sounding exasperated. "Or perhaps you're just a nervous wreck."</p> <p>I shook my head, as if that would answer. I wanted to find out where this was all leading to. Maybe I shouldn't have gotten married, although I guess I'd already done that - we weren't on a date.</p> <p>"It's not entirely uncommon for customers to get upset. They don't want you to rush out into the night."</p> <p>The man's face dropped and he looked at me in surprise.</p> <p>"Are you going to make a decision soon about getting up to something like this again?" he asked. "I'm not sure I trust you with this part of it. Maybe I should call a friend of mine and get things moving."</p> <p>I shook my head.</p> <p>"Oh don't worry about that at all. I really do need to know if I'm doing it right. I already told you I like it from behind," I teased. I knew it was the wrong thing to say to make, but the truth was, the entire town would just be too crowded with people who might actually look. I needed to know that I was doing this right, before it was too late!</p> <p>"You shouldn't be surprised," he said. "I've heard it goes both ways once you start. You are still in the clear. I won't be too upset if you don't decide to come back." He laughed.</p> <p>I smiled again.</p> <p>"I'm sure if I stayed I could make it worth my while."</p> <p>He laughed.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want me to stay?" he asked. "Are you sure you want to go through with this?"</p> <p>I shrugged. "Sure. I'm nervous about the whole thing." I thought about my husband, who had always been the one to bring home the best of everything and I couldn't fault him.</p> <p>"I know," the man said, "though I'd feel like I'd rather stay out here, if that's okay." My guess was that the conversation was too uncomfortable for us.</p> <p>"Okay," I agreed.</p> <p>The man shrugged.</p> <p>He was clearly in no hurry, and probably didn't even know I was sitting there.</p> <p>"Besides, I'd love to stay for a bit, wouldn't you?" he asked.</p> <p>I nodded, and with the last bits of my reserve gone, I wasn't sure I was willing to go through all of this againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
