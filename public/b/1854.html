I groaned, arching my back and pushing my cock deeper and deeper into her mouth. She began to jerk me off faster, now bobbing up and down in a very, very fast motion. I leaned my back into the pillows, pressing my ass closer with each stroke of her tongue.</p> <p>My wife sucked me deeper, her head bobbing up and down on my length. My wife continued to work my balls into my body as she took me deeper and deeper into her mouth with each stroke. I could feel the head of my cock swelling with each stroke on my wife's tongue. The smell of my wife's lips and mouth on my cock filled the air of her lounge room, and I could feel it pressing tightly against my belly.</p> <p>"I can feel it," I gasped. "I can't hold back much longer."</p> <p>She gave a muffled sigh and started to move her mouth up and down, pumping my dick with a wet tongue and sucking me in and out of her warm mouth. She reached up and grabbed my balls again, squeezing them gently. I arched my back to press my head against the headboard of the bed, pushing hard against her. Her tongue moved back down to the ridge of my cock as I felt myself about to lose it. My fingers curled on the edge of the bed frame as a shot of white hot cum sprayed out my dick and into her mouth. She continued to suck me down, letting the cum in her mouth slide down the back of her mouth. She was moaning around my dick as she felt the heat of my orgasm shoot into her mouth. My fingers fisted the edge of the bed, wanting nothing more than to hold her ass open for my cock as jet after jet of my cum jetted into the back of her throat.</p> <p>As my orgasm faded I felt her mouth leave my cock. She raised herself up onto her knees and stared at me intently as I lay still on the bed. I felt her fingers run along the length of my cock as it throbbed in excitement. She wrapped her hand around my dick and started to stroke me slowly. We lay on our sides, looking at each other with nothing more than our soft mutual stares. She was smiling, and her eyes were shining. She took my hand and stroked me harder, stroking my dick as she ran her fingers down my ass crack.</p> <p>"I have wanted you this way ever since I met you," she whispered into my ear.</p> <p>I moaned as I felt her hand slide around my asshole, pressing it with her finger tips. She rubbed against my ass again, and I groaned again as the finger slipped into my ass. There was just a little bit of pain, but it quickly passed.</p> <p>"I know you had the same thing," she whispered. "Just trust me!"</p> <p>"I do," I replied. "I mean it."</p> <p>She lifted herself off of the bed and got down on all fours. Her face was just inches from my dick, and her hot breath blew over it. She looked good like that, with her big green eyes, her long blonde hair, and her beautiful round, round ass. I could feel myself hardening against her. Her skin was pink at the top, the small of her back and her cute, tight ass looked awesome.</p> <p>"Fuck," I groaned. "Fuck. I mean... what the fuck! How do I even explain it?"</p> <p>"Shh," she whispered. "Don't worry. You'll get over it. It's for your own good!"</p> <p>My dick was throbbing as she slowly stroked it up and down. I reached down and grabbed her hips, lifting them up, pushing them back as she kept stroking my dick. I felt the cum oozing out of my dick as I watched her move up and down. Her hand moved faster and faster as she felt herself getting closer to another orgasm.</p> <p>"Fuck yes! Do it! I need it!" she screamed.</p> <p>I felt her body tensed and she leaned backwards as the waves of pleasure rolled over her. I felt my balls tighten as she pressed my dick hard again into her hot pussy. Her mouth opened as she began to shake and cry out in pleasure, and her body convulsed into orgasm. I felt her pussy throb down hard on me, her body tensing as her orgasm wracked her body. I could feel her body quivering with pleasure as she came for what felt like forever, and for what felt like a very long time. Slowly she relaxed and fell forward, her body lying on the bed, her hair flapping back and forth.</p> <p>"Thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
