He then went to work; I began to feel slightly weak, the blood in my veins began to race; I could feel myself get smaller, but I did not care; the doctor could do it all, no matter how minor, and he could always treat it. I felt myself being held by his strong hands for a little while longer, it was difficult at first and it only gave his hand the confidence to pull me in as he was doing, I got the feeling to where I could feel his warmth to begin to envelope me as he began to rub, he knew what the sensation was and soon it was building slowly, the pressure building like my body was just getting stronger. It all seemed to go on forever, eventually, I began to feel like someone had a hand full of a warm, gentle hand, I did not feel any desire to stop what was happening, I just knew I was going to cum any second, I was scared because I had to say it, the pressure built but he didn't stop, his hand felt enormous, the pressure seemed to go on and on and, finally, it seemed to go on forever. I could feel him begin to grow, and I knew I was about to cum, the feeling grew and I just gave out a silent gasp that I knew I wouldn't be able to hold it. He gently pushed me back to the table and helped me up, I was weak from the pain I was in and the dizziness I had at the end. He quickly pulled me into the arms and soon I was fast asleep.</p> <p>The next morning I found myself alone in the kitchen, it was dark and I could make out the shape of something in the darkness. It had no face, the figure of a man sat beside me in a chair and he spoke and I listened to him. He asked me the name of the woman who had gone to the doctor's office with me, I told him it was my wife. He asked me where my home was and I gave him the address, the person who had been in my life was there, in that moment I didn't care the names, or the face. He came to the chair and sat down again and I looked at the top in the floor; he had moved to the edge of the carpet. He said something about me being his partner and he looked at me again and then he began to stroke my face and forehead with a soft touch. He put his hand on the side of my face and I heard tears in his voice. His hands felt so good, so soft and gentle. One of his large hands was rubbing around the base of my face, over my cheeks, making me feel the pressure. I looked at him for the longest time before I leaned forward and gently kissed his lips, he kissed again, this time softer this time and with deeper hunger, I was afraid I couldn't stop the feeling from filling me, my lips moving over his warm mouth as my tongue played across his bottom lip.</p> <p>I felt his hand moving and then a warm hand as it cupped my breast, I moaned quietly with pleasure as his fingers gently massaged me, it felt so good to have his long fingers moving down over me and I felt my nipples begin to grow hard under the thinness of his clothes. I thought about what his long fingers were doing to me, I imagined what they might be like now, sliding over me, into me. His fingers began to pull up at my top as his mouth found mine, his tongue slid deep into my mouth, oh how I wanted to feel it in my body, so badly. He pulled my top off, and his mouth followed it up to my breasts. I gasped, and he pulled away, then his mouth returned to mine, he kissed me softly, at my breast, down slowly over the top. My nipples were becoming as hard as my breasts, but he had little trouble with that, he rolled first one in his fingers and then the other in his mouth as his hand slid back to continue manipulating my now stiffening nipples. His mouth went back to my breast and his hand slid up the skirt of my dress, I felt his tongue probing me as his fingers found my hot wetness. It felt so good to feel that tongue of his and I wanted more, even though I wanted more than just a soft touch there, I wanted to feel his hot body against me and see how my body felt.</p> <p>My eyes closed as I felt his fingers slide into the wetness of me. That felt good and so good. He began to play with my body, his hands glowed as his fingers slid up and down over the skin of my legs, he kissed me gently as he continued to masturbate me. My knees were getting weak again, and I knew I needed to be fucked. I had to. I needed to fuck him hard but I needed the release. I moaned again as his fingers found their rhythm in my pussyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
