I'm going to go make drinks and then I'm going to stay away from the bar and watch the parade."</p> <p>After a brief discussion with a few other girls I got in the car and joined everyone to the dance floor at the bar. At least most of our group danced a little at least once. I started getting a bit uncomfortable. I was still a bit drunk. I was really enjoying the music.</p> <p>"Where's this other girl that we were dancing with last night?"</p> <p>"Yeah, last night, I think. She got her hands all over me. It was fun. I bet it was even fun watching her lick your tits."</p> <p>"I bet hers did the same to me."</p> <p>"Yeah, you better watch yourself."</p> <p>We danced for a while as the music played. Finally she came to a decision. I had had enough of my drink but the music was driving me crazy and I needed to get off the dance floor. To do that I had to loosen my clothes. I took the rest of my clothes off and stepped out on the dance floor. Everyone was watching me. I tried to dance a little in front of them. When I did that I felt like somebody was following me. I was so horny and excited. This was the night I finally got rid of all the inhibitions. I wanted to be fucked. I wanted to be fucked by a bunch of guys. That's what it was all about. It was then that I finally noticed that I wasn't naked anymore. Maybe I needed to change clothes, but most of them couldn't help but be interested in what I was wearing.</p> <p>"Whoa, stop being so modest," I complained. "I might as well get out of this bar and go home."</p> <p>As I walked away from the group I looked at my hips. I knew that wasn't a good sign. At least there was no nudity now. Not a few of them were now eyeing my ass. We walked to the bar and drank some more. We danced a little more, some of our group was getting bolder with us. We left the dance floor and went to another table. I was feeling a little better now I was out there. The girls were all touching my breasts, rubbing my ass and talking to me. I kept looking around, and saw one of the guys with their hands on a girl's tits. She was sucking his friends cock. I looked down at their hands touching me. All the guys were having a go at her. I was getting turned on now. Maybe it would help if they touched and groped my body.</p> <p>"That's a nice tingle that's been on my butt ever since I woke up."</p> <p>My partner came up to me and tried to move my hand down to my pussy. Instead it went to my hand. He put his hand on my leg and lifted it, showing me the fingers of his hand. He touched my hand a few times more before he put it back where it was. I wasn't sure what to do. It felt so good, and he was very good. I started moving my hand up and down his thigh. He was getting hard but I hadn't expected him to be so large. I took my hand away and looked around.</p> <p>"I think I'm going to leave you two to it. You were doing good."</p> <p>"No, really we are just enjoying each other's company too much to want to stop."</p> <p>I had to agree with her when she said that. It was nice to at least have someone there, and they made it so comfortable. They made me so horny that I wanted to just fuck them. I turned around to see all the other girls on the dance floor watching. They were having fun. As I danced with one of them she reached out and pulled my hand. It almost felt as good as being with her. It was all I could do not to reach out and start squeezing and playing with her butt. I tried to stop her but she reached around my waist and I could feel her breasts against me and her nipples growing as I rubbed them. I was starting to get really excited. They were both getting so excited by what they were doing. As I danced with her I felt her soft hand rub my pussy in the very dark of the room. Not knowing what was happening she slowly slipped a finger inside me. I really liked it even though nothing was happening there yet.</p> <p>Then she moved her finger back, and her hand moved down to my hip again. She moved her finger around inside me as she continued dancing with me then back up to my hip. I tried to pull her finger away but she wouldn't give up and moved her finger back to my hip. She moved her finger around in my pussy more often and she was getting more bold. Suddenly she stopped moving herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
