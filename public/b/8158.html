I dunno," I stammered, feeling completely flustered. Her words had started to sting and a slight tremor ran through me as well. "I kinda thought you liked them?" she asked, still playing coy.</p> <p>I started to reply, but thought better of it.</p> <p>I was a lot, really.</p> <p>"Oh yeah." Katie agreed, a little sheepishly. "If I tell you, I'll let you touch them like you were gonna. That's how I'd like it. I'd enjoy a chance to feel some of that nice young thing."</p> <p>The other two girls laughed as Katie took out the strap-on from her pocket. A look of shock crossed her face. "Wha-what? Don't you have those? What about her?"</p> <p>"Well she said yes to most of the stuff, but it didn't work just then. It just took her awhile to get it going, maybe a week at least." Katie seemed to take in a deep breath as she held the dildo inches from my face.</p> <p>I'd never seen it in person before, yet it seemed almost real to me, as I felt the soft warmth of it against my cheek. I leaned forward and kissed it. She took the dildo and pressed it closer to my face. I'd wanted to kiss it, but I was afraid I might get chapped. At that point I started to realize how badly I wanted to kiss it. I started to lick it.</p> <p>Katie looked over to the other girls as I did it and said, "Well, if one or the other one wants to, just kiss it, then that's just fine."</p> <p>I looked down and saw that there were four girls, none of them wearing any clothing. I didn't see either.</p> <p>Katie moved the dildo back towards my face. I took the wet tip in my mouth and sucked it, which was much too soon for me.</p> <p>"See?" she said, with a smirk.</p> <p>I could tell that if I kissed it, I'd know it, and that I'd be able to deep kiss it without anyone noticing.</p> <p>I took a deep breath. "Ugh," I said. "That's just bad."</p> <p>I looked back up again and saw them looking at me, as well, with little smiles on their faces. Katie looked over at her friend who must have been watching me also, and said, "Well, maybe she'll use the other way. I guess I'll see how long Katie is here while we wait. And while you guys watch, come back in for the show." They both just looked at my face in curiosity now.</p> <p>"I'll be back!" I said.</p> <p>I walked over to the couch and pulled out two beers from the bag I'd brought.</p> <p>"Here ya go girls," I said to them. I handed one of theirs to one of the girls, then sat on the couch. Katie moved to my other side and sat on the other side of me. "Now, why don't you guys give me a couple of your cocks and get started!</p> <p>The girls wasted no time, and I felt them begin to work on me. The head of Katie's strap-on vibrated inside of mine and I started to feel that familiar jostle and jolt of electricity that precedes orgasm.</p> <p>Katie moaned and started to rub her ass, while watching me. "Do you like that, sweetie?" she said. She took my left hand and put it on her right, so we could rub our pussies together. Katie's movements quickened. After a while, she reached back and took handfuls of my hair, and I pulled it just an inch or two, just as a reward. She held it there. I could feel the wetness of her pussy on my fingers as they pressed against it.</p> <p>I looked over to the foursome. Katie was riding and riding the other one's girlfriend's strap-on, making noises of enjoyment and satisfaction with the sensation. "You wanna feel them do that, mama," Katie said.</p> <p>The other one was on her knees at the edge of the couch, rubbing her pussy up against it as she stood up against me, rocking in a back-and-forth motion. I didn't notice anything at first, but it got easier as Katie moved her hips until she'd gotten comfortable on her toes. I noticed that I could move mine as well, and I'd also be able to push it against it too. I reached out for her left ass cheek, and held it there. The head of her cock was right against the outside of my pussy, and her hips made little little whirring motion against it.</p> <p>"Feelâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
