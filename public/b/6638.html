"Mmm, mmm, mmm" as she started to play with her pussy and watch him fondle and feel her. This was the first time he had ever been able to touch her up and make her orgasm when they made their love making. The feelings and sensations she had from his mouth and fingers on her pussy excited her even more, and she knew that it may feel better a bit later.</p> <p>She pushed him away and stood up next to him, so she may him reach down and feel how wet she was.</p> <p>"Doing okay, sweetie. Are you excited?"</p> <p>He blushed as he realized that she was teasing him and that he couldn't help himself as he watched her. Her breasts were still heaving as she stood there, and he caught that she was turned on, his cock rising slightly to point directly toward her pussy. She leaned in and kissed him deeply, feeling his erection push against her belly. He was hard to reach, he could feel the veins on his cock bulge as they pushed against his briefs.</p> <p>"You don't mind if I suck you, do you, sweetie?"</p> <p>He didn't answer directly as he watched her as she pulled her jeans and panties down her legs. The look on her face was one of disappointment as she realized that she wasn't going to have this with the man who was kneeling beside her on the couch.</p> <p>The head of his erection was bulging as it stood upright, and the head was shiny with her saliva.</p> <p>"Are you going to use it, sweetheart?" she smiled and kissed his cheek and said, "Oh, I'm not letting you do that, yet...oh, and not until I tell you."</p> <p>"Oh, yes, please, you, ma'am," he groaned as he kissed her.</p> <p>She turned off the light and they laid down on the couch, kissing as he caressed her breasts and pussy, slowly at first. He felt her nipples harden under his fingers and kissed lower down until he reached her panties. He peeled them off and lay down next to her, feeling her breasts and pussy as they got hotter. Their kissing stopped as he felt the wetness of the crotch of her panties, and he held it to his face and inhaled her aroma. He held his tongue out to get it near her pussy, and she lifted her legs toward him as the tip of it reached her lips, and he took her panties out of his mouth and took a deep breath as she put her hand on his head and pushed him into her, kissing her down the side of his lips then up again as far as she could reach. She held his face between her hands as she held her body against his mouth. Their breathing became ragged as she continued kissing him, still stroking his face with her hands.</p> <p>"I have to have you, sweetie," she said as she pulled his hand down to her pussy and said, "I've missed this." She started to say it and turned to look at him as she pressed down on his finger, then turned and looked up as she put his mouth on her other breast. She pulled his hand between her legs as she leaned back and turned toward him, then she took his hand and put it up her skirt.</p> <p>"I'm so wet," he said as he realized that he hadn't put any underwear on.</p> <p>"Well...I'm going to put it in."</p> <p>"No, no, that's fine, just use my hand to try to get it in."</p> <p>She smiled, took his hand and held it against her pussy. "Oh, I think I'm wet enough. I wanted him to know it," she laughed. The finger that was there just barely touching her wetness started to move in and out while he caressed her lips.</p> <p>"Just do it, ma'am," he moaned.</p> <p>He continued to explore the lips with his finger as he moved his middle finger back and forth, feeling the warmth and moisture. "Feel how wet I am for you, sweetheart?" he asked in a soft voice. "Do you like having my finger in your pussy? Do you like to have my finger in your pussy?" he smiled.</p> <p>"Mmm, yes, honey," she giggled.</p> <p>He was so caught up in her feelings, that he didn't realize that she was turned on by what he was doing between her legs until he felt the wetness of her pussy. It made her feel so hot and wet, and as she rubbed her finger over her clit, his finger joined her hand and she closed her lips over hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
