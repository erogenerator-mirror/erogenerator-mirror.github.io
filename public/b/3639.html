I mean, what if we start again and get lost?"</p> <p>"No, if I didn't believe that you were going to do it, then we would be done," Sarah said softly. She leaned over and kissed me deeply on the lips. "So, I guess you know what we can do then."</p> <p>We looked through tears at each other, and we were both laughing. "Ok," Jen said with a shrug, "But it won't be this quick; we still need to set things straight with you and your wife."</p> <p>"Not just us," Sarah said, holding me tightly in the embrace. "But, me and Karen," Sarah added. I put my arms around both and we fell asleep that night. We woke up the following day early. I had been up for a few hours when our cell phones were answered. We were able to talk about what had happened while asleep. Jen gave me some details, and I told her about my encounter a few days back, and how exciting it was for me to be with another woman.</p> <p>Sarah told me about the surprise I got when Karen gave me the directions in the morning while getting ready for work. I knew that the surprise would be going to be fun, and that I was going to enjoy it immensely. "So, do you want to join me so we can keep it our own little secret?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Yes," she said in a sultry voice, "If you can carry on with our little talk, it'll be a lot of fun."</p> <p>"I'm really looking forward to it, and I have a lot more fun planned for you, Karen," I said.</p> <p>Sarah told me to get dressed, and to come home and start our meeting the following Saturday.</p> <p>We met Karen in the local coffee shop with a little more than two hours to go before her husband got home to greet us.</p> <p>"He's probably glad," Sarah said.</p> <p>"Me too," I replied.</p> <p>"Good," Karen responded, "we're not going to go into more detail and you're going to keep it totally to yourself," she said to me.</p> <p>She pulled me close, and kissed me, and then took my hand and put it on her breast. "I'm sure that he enjoyed that little bit of fun in the hallway while we discussed the whole thing," she said as we kissed again. Her hand was still in my lap right then. She was starting to become very excited now, and I was too.</p> <p>"No, no, no Karen, don't do it," I begged her, "You're going to have to tell me the entire story."</p> <p>She smiled and kissed me again. Then, she kissed my ear, and whispered, "Ok. Let's start with something that we just agreed on."</p> <p>She started telling me some of the things that she did or did not do to me while I masturbated.</p> <p>"So when she took your cock in her hands and started rubbing it, it felt so good; even getting it hard was a real turn on for me," Karen said to me.</p> <p>"So was it?" I asked, "What turned me on so much, was feeling her hand on my cock, feeling her lips and tongue on it, getting it up so I could cum," she said with a laugh.</p> <p>"Yeah, I have a feeling that he will be thinking about it now," Sarah laughed too.</p> <p>We were getting really excited about that.</p> <p>The first thing that Karen started telling us about the surprise was that Karen had decided that I was the one they were going to take control of at our meeting. She also said that I was going to "train" her so that she could get a sense of what it looked like to be in control.</p> <p>What the hell?</p> <p>"Sarah, I love you very much," Karen said as she leaned over and kissed me.</p> <p>"I love you, too, Karen," Sarah said as she kissed her, and then leaned in and kissed her cheek. Karen pulled away and got up off the bed, and got her purse. She was going to walk back out, but stopped when she saw me. She looked at me with those big gorgeous eyes.</p> <p>"I hope you brought a change of clothes for me tonight," I asked her.</p> <p>"No, not for you," she said with a smile as she got dressed. "And I'm going to have one of those little surprise for you," she added as her hand went under the blanket to play with my hard cock.</p> <p>I didn't say a word; I just let her stroke me through my pants until it was fully erect. Then, she stepped back and kissed me againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
