"Yes! Yes!" I cried, "Yes, oh, my god, yes," as my sperm flooded her mouth and ran over her face.</p> <p>As before she kept her mouth firmly attached to my cock until I softened and pulled out. I turned the car around, and we were off. A minute later we were out on the front sidewalk of the town square, in front of my building.</p> <p>As she drove we exchanged the usual small talk and light drinks, like we had years ago. Neither of us really got into the relationship we both craved, but not really in an unpleasant way, at least until Diane spoke up in a breathy, "I want you to know there is an old apartment at the base of this building."</p> <p>I felt I was being a jerk by letting her off the hook. I was still not really sure what I expected from her. We got to the old building and her eyes opened immediately, "I saw this place just off the top of the building, and I was looking at some pictures and thinking about last night. Did you remember it?"</p> <p>I could not really believe she was asking me what to do. "Yes," I said. "Sure."</p> <p>"It looks nice," she said. "I like it. And I can't wait to see it. I like that it's neat. Did you have sex with the old tenants?"</p> <p>"What?" My mind was whirling with confusion, not really believing she knew about that.</p> <p>"You know about that old man next door who worked at that place? He had a key, if you remember. He was really good at it. Maybe he was bi as well, but the place was empty too."</p> <p>"We did have sex with him?" There was a bit of hope there.</p> <p>"You knew he would be there, couldn't you have seen the picture?"</p> <p>"No. I didn't know. I didn't know, you know...".</p> <p>"No," she cut in. "You didn't know, but you knew."</p> <p>I had no real idea where this was going, with Diane. My dick started to stiffen a little. "Do you know anyone there that I know?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Oh, yes." She was still not sure she should feel this way. "If they knew, they would go away."</p> <p>"Did you get involved with it while you were there?"</p> <p>"The one person that ever gave me pleasure?" She gave me a mischievous grin.</p> <p>We drove on in silence. It was hard to think about. The time had arrived to ask the most important question of my life. I just kept on feeling it in my brain, almost at bay. She finally said, "I'm sorry," and pulled over to the side of the building.</p> <p>As we waited for her to unlock and open the door, I tried to make as much conversation as I could. She told me how they met and had an arrangement going, but I had nothing to say to her. But I could not keep away from her anymore than I could hold back my curiosity.</p> <p>When Diane opened the door, she was radiant in her high shoes. "Thank you for seeing me Mr. D," she said. "Can I use your elevator again?"</p> <p>She turned around to let me in. She was wearing a black buttoned-down blouse buttoned down the front and a low-cut black skirt. The skirt barely covered the tops of her stockings. I still could not believe how gorgeous her legs and body looked in that dress. It must have been at least a size bigger than I expected, but it was still breathtaking.</p> <p>When she came down to me and let me in the elevator, she smiled and asked me how I was doing. "Oh! I'm doing all right. You know, the whole thing in front of me, I feel a little more excited now."</p> <p>"Well, I would love to show you something," I said. "I have been very good at the business. What do you think would be appropriate in that case?"</p> <p>"You already know where I would be."</p> <p>The elevator was not that big. I had to reach the other end. She got the key and followed her lover. I followed a man. His name was Carl from the picture she had seen. His name was Henry. He had dark hair, very dark, and dark, eyes that were a bit darker, but not as dark as mine. He was carrying a small suitcase. I asked Diane where he was staying.</p> <p>"There has to be some money in that," Diane said.</p> <p>"I see.
