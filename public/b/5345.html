It makes me horny.</p> <p>*</p> <p>So here we are. We have a beautiful day. We're relaxing, chatting, laughing....the sex is great. I'm a mess, naked in bed, wondering how I should have sex with a woman, having my first threesome experience with a woman.</p> <p>I just can't get over my stupid idea of a 'dirty girl' coming with me, having sex with a woman. To be a dirty girl, I have to think of someone else on the inside, a more mature person. I wonder if I have it right.</p> <p>I had a friend call, she was an old girl, not really your grandchild, but a person you met. One moment you were at her party, another and so much more was on the way, you were going through the motions. You couldn't have given her a more suitable place to set up, she would be as surprised as I was, not that I've heard the same in other people.</p> <p>I wasn't going to put her off on my account that the sex was fucking hot, I just thought that if I did that, I would get some new friends, you know, one who might be good friends. So I'm a bit confused.</p> <p>My second problem is the feeling of being dirty and not just of being a good person for being dirty.</p> <p>I don't want to start with someone I hardly know. I've been there and done that, so why is I a dirty girl instead of a good person.</p> <p>*</p> <p>I'm going up to the bedroom, naked and soapy. It's a great feeling to have your skin on mine, and this time we're washing it. Then we turn on all fours, taking the sponge down to scrub it off, with my legs and bottom still bare. It feels different. I've been doing it for a long while after I met my friend, and I find it incredibly sexy.</p> <p>I feel more relaxed as we're laying down. I wonder what happened to their sex life as we lay there. I feel a bit stupid for feeling so dirty about it, so I get up on my knees so that I'm on all fours in the middle of the bed. I'm going for deep space and I'm going, almost at the edge, feeling the softness of my skin, and feeling it slide up and down all over my body, feeling the texture of my own skin, just soft, yet sexy, all over, slippery, soft. I'm not sure if I want to stop, but I can't find any other way to ask. You could tell that I was going to want to, but it would only make things worst.</p> <p>Oh, and it's just skin, no hair. I take it all off anyway. When I'm done, I'll find some sexy stuff in the hamper I brought with me. I'm not sure about this, but you have to try.</p> <p>*</p> <p>I'm so excited about the threesome experience, and the idea of meeting someone else. We hadn't had sex, but we had thought about it, and, well, we couldn't put this off long enough.</p> <p>My friend's coming next weekendâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
