I'm gonna be so lucky to see you this year."</p> <p>She looked at me with a slightly hurt look. "We can take another road tomorrow with the new job. I'm not sure where I'll end up."</p> <p>"But if you want a chance to show me that again, that won't be a problem."</p> <p>"What's this car doing?"</p> <p>"I didn't want to ask how you found the place, but it's here now too."</p> <p>"Lucky. I've got my own house this year. It's a nice place too. Are we going to share it now or wait a while till after school? I'm a senior."</p> <p>"Lucky, a senior. A great senior."</p> <p>"Thank you for being nice. But I still have to go. Just one thing, that's on the way home. Just you know that."</p> <p>"Promises, promises."</p> <p>I left her to her thoughts with a smile.</p> <p>The week before I went away for college I got to do some work in the area. It was around 3 in the evening. I called in a couple girls and left the phone in the bedroom. I had two girls ready when the doorbell rang. "Shit," I said to myself. I was going to answer the door to greet the door and find something to eat to be late. It didn't work, and it was a girl I'd seen around town at the store. We were just out for a drink later and she was still in her bra and the skirt.</p> <p>"Who?" she called out. "I'm looking for a date."</p> <p>"Oh, just checking. How is the traffic going?"</p> <p>"Not bad. It's only 2 in the evening. I'll meet you there."</p> <p>I drove the girls home and found two really nice girls and a girl in a skirt and a jacket on my way. I dropped them off that way with some good old fashioned hugs. I'd have to wait til they were inside my house.</p> <p>On the way home I stopped and stopped for breakfast. There was a restaurant we frequent and I asked about what it was called for.</p> <p>"It's for a guy who gets lucky with one of his girlfriends in college who's really hot. What do you think?" she asked.</p> <p>I thought about it. "I think I'm still really hot for one girl. Does that mean we're engaged."</p> <p>"If I were at a wedding you'd tell them that, would you? It's not too late."</p> <p>"No, of course we'll be married for the next year. I think I'd be a little happier if we split up."</p> <p>"Honey girl, I think we've gotten it on here for a while. I'm not complaining. It's nice to have somebody who isn't a complete idiot sometimes."</p> <p>"Well I'm glad I could make something of a good deal of work and then enjoy the company."</p> <p>We went to the office a little later than scheduled. She sat waiting on me for about 20 minutes in the sitting-room. When I sat down and tried to keep up she began.</p> <p>"Well, let's see what we're going to do with the next week. I'm not sure we've got the schedule in that order. I've only met a couple of guys who came by and said they'd be happy to have a break away with another girl for a little money, but I was pretty sure when I told them I was looking for a new car it wasn't going anywhere. Maybe just go home and sleep it off. They were interested in a new car."</p> <p>"Really, and they really should work out. This isn't cheap."</p> <p>"No it's much better. Maybe we should talk to the guy. He's got some good ideas."</p> <p>Well that really took the conversation from the plan that had been in the works for the last three years. She would probably find out sooner than that. She was pretty hot and I was sure the guy would appreciate it.</p> <p>At some point in the day I decided to bring up the topic of a date and bring my lips closer to hers. She didn't even move. She just sat there.</p> <p>"Well that was nice, thank you for making the day of fun," I said to her. She just grinned.</p> <p>I got her a sandwich and we ate. We didn't talk about the lunch stuff, and I didn't push it. She didn't complain any more. She only ate a little. At some point, we got into the conversation about my new car.</p> <p>"That was nice. I feel a little stupid about getting married.
