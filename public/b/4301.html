By then, we had made our way to the main room. The first thing we did was find a place to sit down in my living room to talk. There were several guys dancing on the stage, but it was not much of a crowd to begin with. We were able to talk around a few folks and a few others, even a couple others in the group. After what passed as an eternity, the one in the bar finally stopped and we got up.</p> <p>We went and sat down opposite each other. When the song ended, I leaned in and gave her a kiss. She pulled back. As the song finished, I stood and stepped back, to a round of applause from a few girls.</p> <p>We went back and sat in the back corner of my living room, sipping on a soda. A couple guys got a little closer and began flirting with us. At first, my dick got hard. I was sure I was going to shoot my load right there. The two guys kept talking about something and I felt like I was watching the action as they pulled down her top, exposing one of the biggest boobs I had ever gotten a look at. They had their hands on her tits under the table, not touching and not pulling away, but just trying to pull off what they thought was a great piece of ass. As we watched, they pushed up her top, allowing one guy to reach up and grab the other boob. They played with her boob for a while, and it was almost enough to send me over the edge.</p> <p>I was surprised how much I was turned off by this display. Before, you would have thought I would have jerked off and had my dick ready to explode any minute (which was really a few minutes), but with it being so close to an event that I was now worried about. I knew it was not about the reaction, it was about a woman, and what it was like to have her tits in your hand and in your mouth. This was my new favorite part of a lesbian act, and I could feel it happening right in front of my face.</p> <p>It occurred to me that this couple was probably not the only ones that wanted to get their hands on some of the more attractive women there. I would have loved to reach out and cup her huge boobs, but there were a lot of other guys there that were more into getting their hands on those breasts. I felt a little guilty. I felt bad for a little while, but I had to see what I could do. She was attractive, but not in a sexual way. She was a total mystery to me. She probably had to have had the sexiest body or the most perfect breasts. But on the other hand, there was no way that I was going to be able to find a good guy, let alone a partner who looked, for me to spend even less time in the bedroom.</p> <p>As I stared, she took another drink from her drink, and looked over at me. I didn't really want to be there, but her eye contact caught me, and it caused a little shiver. She said, "You need some help?"</p> <p>It took several seconds for us to get into the conversation, but I could see the wheels of her mind. She asked, "What about you?"</p> <p>"I could say the same thing." I answered.</p> <p>The guy said, "You want to help? We could share if you do."</p> <p>A little embarrassed, I said, "I'd be happy to, if it's all right with everyone."</p> <p>He said, "That's not what we're here for." And he leaned in close to give her a really hot kiss. It was an awkward embrace, but I did not get mad. It was hard to imagine kissing someone like that and I let the guy keep the contact. She did pull back for a second, and this time, she kissed me on the corner of my mouth where my neck was and on my cheek. She pulled back and said, "Come here," and leaned over to give me a short kiss on the corner of my mouth and on my lips. She was going to pull back again, but I took her and kissed her back. It felt strange kissing somebody that I had met only hours before.</p> <p>She whispered, "Let's try something else," and said, "Let's dance."</p> <p>With that she got up and slipped off her shorts (which she kept in the dark, of course) and shoes before pulling her shirt over her head, and sat down near by, with a big round boob in her hands. I could only take my jeans off in front of my buddy's wife and she wasn't showing any tits. The guy said,</p> <p>"Do you mind if I take offâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
