We were at an airport and I noticed that we were in the middle of the airport's exit. Sam was dressed in a white blouse and black leather pants that showed the curves of her body nicely. This outfit came with the skirt and black boots that showed off her legs and butt nicely.</p> <p>"Hello ma, how have you been?" I asked.</p> <p>I thought it must mean the same thing here, as far as I was aware. Sam came up behind me and I felt her hands running up my chest, under my arms, to the nape of my neck. My arms were free now, but I was so tense all I could do was take a breath. I started to cry and this only made Sam's hands slide down and cup my breasts. This was unexpected and she stopped to pinch and pull my nipples and she began to knead and massage them gently.</p> <p>"I hope it's okay Sam." We stepped out of the plane at the resort and walked the short distance to the car. Sandra handed me a piece of paper.</p> <p>"Here is your hotel. The rest of it is on the other side of the airport. The rest you need to get over there quickly and get ready for your flight." I took the piece of paper and began to turn to walk away. "And Sam, don't forget the plane." Sam said as she pushed me to the pavement. "I want you to do something special for me, that's all." Her hand slid down the front of my blouse and onto my bare nipple. She pinched it gently, sending more of my arousal straight through me.</p> <p>In less than ten minutes I was in the car, with her hand in my lap. In the back seat, with her hand resting on my lap, I tried not to think of my brother, trying to think of anything. I did all I could not to start the car right at the airport right then, but I didn't want to put it off. I didn't have to drive.</p> <p>"I know you have to get your luggage in the car and take it to your hotel. But we can't go to the airport in the middle of the day like this. The plane ride will be uneventful and we will have a nice dinner after that." She sat in the middle of the seat.</p> <p>It was so wrong and forbidden but I knew it wasn't. She leaned forward and kissed me softly on the lips.</p> <p>"Thank you, Sam. I love you." Her hand cupped my breast and began to rub the nipple in small circles. It felt so strange to have something so delicate and so small touching me. Her mouth returned to my neck and began to kiss and bite. My pussy began to moisten with every kiss. When she had me to stop, she stood and unbuttoned her blouse. She slid the straps down her arms and off of her shoulders, giving me a glimpse of her breasts. They were smaller, but not too small, and very firm. Her breasts had a nice cleavage and her nipples stood erect from the cool air that caressed them.</p> <p>She lifted one up and ran the tip along my tongue. She pushed it back and forth, pulling it slowly into her mouth as she took it out, smiling at me with a sweet knowing gaze. She dropped one breast, then another, to the side of that nipple and began to lick and suck on them, making me moan in pleasure and anticipation.</p> <p>Finally, she turned around and stood there, facing her seat. It was still dark, but she didn't seem to notice. "Come on Sam, make me come." She smiled at me.</p> <p>I began to remove my clothes and my breasts were covered in perspiration. I removed them all the way, but left her body completely bare. As I sat on the back of the seat, I pushed her legs apart and reached between them. I felt my panties being slowly pulled down, over her hips, down her legs, until my pussy was exposed. She spread her legs as I removed the panties and as my fingers sought out her wet pussy. She spread her knees farther apart and began to pant. I moved between her legs and lowered myself onto her. I felt this part of her begin to move up and down. It was a bit awkward because her legs were together but I managed to fit both of my thighs over her hips. As the feeling of my pussy on her pussy intensified, I was able to move around a bit more. We began to slowly move in the seat as she pressed her hands against my breasts and moved her hips more vigorously. Now, her head began to bob up and down and up and down, in time with the motion of her hips. She stopped the motion of her hips and began to rubâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
