She watched as his fingers caressed her soft labia, she shivered as she imagined it was him; she moaned in anticipation as his lips brushed her clit. One finger pressed into her, he found her G-Spot and she jerked, her legs spreading and thrusting upwards as he stroked the very tip of his tongue over the sensitive flesh of her clit.</p> <p>He flicked his tongue rapidly across it as his finger continued to finger fuck her. She bucked wildly beneath him, she couldn't believe how her body was demanding it; her pussy convulsed as his teeth, tongue and teeth devoured her clit.</p> <p>"Ohhhhhhhh," she moaned as he bit down as he drove her closer and closer to a mind-blowing orgasm.</p> <p>"Mmmhhhh," she moaned as the first explosion of the night rippled through her.</p> <p>His finger plunged into her as he sucked and tongued around her clit, his thumb rubbing roughly across her G-Spot as she thrashed about beneath him in climactic ecstasy.</p> <p>Maggie couldn't talk; she couldn't move as she experienced a mind blowing orgasm that was a mixture of pleasure and pain. Her body began to shake as she gasped for breath, trying to stifle what appeared to be a dozen screams of ecstasy.</p> <p>He slowed his fingers as her second orgasm rippled through her body. She lay there on the bed quivering as she lay there in a daze on the bed, her mind a mass of conflicting emotions. She knew the truth; she'd been wrong; she needed to be right. What was she doing. But something about this night, this feeling of power over her was just so right; she felt it deep in her belly, deep in her heart. There was nothing she could do about it now, there was only happiness.</p> <p>She thought about that first night they'd spent together, after having sex; she'd thought about him, remembering how he'd kissed her after they'd fallen asleep together in her bed. They'd gone to bed as lovers, she'd taken his cock into her hand and led it into her body as she had every night. She'd let him fuck her until she felt the cum rush through her; then she'd fucked his cock until she felt like she came, she'd come like the slut she was; she'd come with a force that wasn't there before.</p> <p>He'd been hard and she'd wanted to feel him inside her. He'd had his way with her, she wanted him to claim her; she got off on having him take control. But most of all she wanted them both together. She could feel her body responding to him; responding to his finger in her and her orgasm; responding to being tied in the same way when he was going to make her come again.</p> <p>She felt the familiar stirring in her loins and knew what was coming. A surge of pleasure hit her as he moved between her legs. He had his thick cock in his hand and she couldn't stop him. She wanted him to fuck her. For the first time she felt a different way of feeling that. It made her more excited, it made her want more of what he'd already made her feel.</p> <p>She felt her body responding by way of his large, hard cock pushing its way into her body and felt it thrusting back, searching for the deepest feelings of her body. She moaned as she felt the feeling of a cock deep inside her causing her body to move in response. She knew she needed to feel it; she needed to feel it filling her; and yet she knew it would happen regardless of what she did.</p> <p>She'd taken a lover's cock. She'd taken a lover's cock in the dark. She moaned as she felt her lover's cock filling her body. It felt so good she wanted to take him in her hands and hold it in her. It would do her some good if she could hold onto his cock. Would it make her happy if she took his cock in her fist and stroke it; would it make him happy when she had his cock in her mouth and tongue? Would it make him happy knowing he would be fucking a new pussy when she had him cum on her tongue?</p> <p>She'd taken a lover's cock in her mouth and had had him in her pussy. She'd taken a lover's cock in her hand and had had it in her mouth. She'd taken him in her hands and had taken him in her pussy at the same time. She wanted to fuck both of them. She needed to be in the bed with him. She needed to feel him in her; she needed to feel her body surrendering to his body. She felt his arms wrapped around her; her bodyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
