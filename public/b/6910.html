I know this is what I want, what I should be doing. For some reason the thought of drinking again seems exciting and exciting at the same time. I feel hot, my mind racing with the prospect of the evening.</p> <p>The door opens and closes and there is silence. I sit myself down and begin to drink the wine, as I feel like I am on my way to some kind of a party or dinner on Broadway, at a party. I drink two glasses and am ready for some of the partying to begin. The room is dark, except for a single light, and I am almost drunk.</p> <p>My mind races as I begin to feel the effects of the wine, feeling it, imagining it. It is intoxicating! I feel the warmth of the lights, the warmth of the wine on my stomach. I think of those who stood beside me in the hallway when I left the house. I can just imagine that he was there, on his knees, looking at me, wanting to take my hands and hold them. I can't take my hand off of my own breasts, as I slide them off, as he looks at them and wants more. There is no escape until he takes them back into his hand, takes both of them as he kisses my palm and then slowly takes them in his mouth, lapping at them, sucking them. I have an erection which is growing inside my pants as he licks them. I do not care who may come along, I want to fuck them! I cannot believe a married woman is doing this for the very first time. I am not sure which is more exciting, the idea or the experience. My hand goes to my thigh, which is now covered in the black stockings which I cannot remove until I have a clear view of them. They look silky and sexy and I can feel them starting to moisten.</p> <p>I am getting really turned on by this, very excited. The wine is having no effect, so it is affecting me a lot. I lean back against the wall. I feel my penis throbbing in my pants. I want to touch it, see it harden, the swollen tip. This is not the time to be shy, so to do it now is not the time. I do not put my hand out, instead I slowly pull my zipper down.</p> <p>I let go of my cock to allow it to go free from within my pants. I can feel the blood pumping through I am hard. It is as if it has wanted to reach me for some time, wanting something it can touch. I turn my face toward it, and allow it to slowly push my face in towards it. It is there, just inches from my lips. I kiss it, then take it in and feel it grow. I take it down my throat and begin exploring the fullness and length with my tongue. The taste of him is different, but also kind of interesting. I start to stroke it up and down and can feel it getting even harder; it is pulsating and throbbing all on its own. I know it is going to come and I can tell by the moans.</p> <p>"I want to fuck your brains out. I want to lick all your juice out of your cock."</p> <p>I do not need any of this and quickly pull my pants off and kneel on the couch. I lift my right leg up to hold it high, like in a gymnastic competition. I reach down and cup my left foot, so that my weight will not lie on my head. My left leg is over the back of the couch between my legs and I can feel the cool air on my wet little slit. My hand now slides down the shaft which is standing straight up. I cup and feel on it my hand. It is so fat and hard and long. I can feel it twitch.</p> <p>I now raise my skirt and feel no pantyhose underneath. My legs feel like jelly. I look at myself in the full length mirror across the back of the couch, my eyes looking at myself. This is it, but I am feeling a little bit scared. But, I will not give up this opportunity, not yet at the present. I lean back and put my panties on. I lay my top on my bed, as I do not want to bother the laundry. I move slowly on the leather couch, feeling the heat and softness. My nipples are standing to attention. My hand goes to my panties. I take them out and put them in my purse, but leave my right hand on my left thigh. I lift my left leg up to rest it on the couch. I look at myself as I put my panties over the foot of the couch, so that my right foot on the couch is on the other side of the couch. My left hand again goes toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
