He said as he leaned his head closer, looking her in the eyes. All that mattered was that she would want to know what he was trying to tell her. It was a conversation he needed to have. He just hoped that she wouldn't know.</p> <p>"I think that's about it." She said with a smile. "It's about her and I."</p> <p>"Oh? Where is she?" he asked her with a questioning look on his face.</p> <p>She looked away from his face for a second and said, "She's at the office on the other side of town."</p> <p>He couldn't go there. He had to finish his business here. "What if she's not coming home."</p> <p>She smiled again and said softly, "We're together now, but nothing else. You and I are just going to have one more drink after your call."</p> <p>He thought about what she said, and it turned him on even more. There was no point in arguing and he looked at his drink, and then thought again. He hadn't looked at his watch, and he knew that they had been going for awhile.</p> <p>"Come on, take it easy. I'm going to the restroom." He said with a laugh. He quickly left the bar and went back toward his office. He was sure that she would see it as a sign that they weren't together. Then he looked at his watch again. He really didn't have to go to the restroom, but he knew that she wouldn't be long.</p> <p>The restroom door opened and he stood aside waiting for she to walk in.</p> <p>"Well good morning." He said looking her up and down again as they walked through the door.</p> <p>"Good morning! That was a nice drink." She said leaning against him as they stood there in the dark. "I hope everything's just going to be like our fantasy."</p> <p>"Yeah, just a bit weird." He said as he stepped closer to her and pulled her close to him.</p> <p>"That's for sure." He said as they made out in a little mini-bump. While they were kissing, he started grinding his groin into hers and his hands went down to her ass. He felt it and could tell it was firm through the flimsy material of her dress. It wasn't that she was braless or that she was braless, but she was wearing something tight and he knew that she'd never go topless or in that kind of dress. So he knew that if she was, he knew where her nipples would be.</p> <p>"How are you enjoying me?" He asked as he kissed the tip of her ear.</p> <p>"I've been missing this all day." She said quietly. "It's been way too long!"</p> <p>"Oh you're going to make a wonderful lover." He said while placing his hand on top of her bare thigh. He wasn't sure that he had even taken a peek down the dress, but he was sure that there probably was. "And you are definitely beautiful! You're so innocent and beautiful!"</p> <p>"All the same, sweetie." She said kissing him again. A little more pressure was applied though, which made her nipples hard against his chest.</p> <p>"So sweetheart... what's your name?" He asked as he moved his hand up and softly stroked her belly.</p> <p>"I've never given my name to anyone before." She said as she put her hand on top of his and pulled him closer to her.</p> <p>"Well, that's okay with me. I'll give my name to the owner of that bar someday!" He said before he ran his other hand down her side and then up her side and cupped her right breast.</p> <p>"Oh damn!" She exclaimed as his hand moved up and found the nipple and began to pull gently. "Oh! Oh. Oh yes. Yes!"</p> <p>He began to kiss up her neck and found her mouth and started to kiss her there.</p> <p>"OH! OH GOD... yes!" She moaned in his ear.</p> <p>He continued to kiss and suck each of her breasts and slowly moved down. He could feel the fabric of her bra rubbing against his hand as he went down and then he was able to take it off and begin kissing and then he began to softly and slowly slide his hand down her body until he was at the bottom of her slit.</p> <p>"OH FUCK... no, no, please." he heard her begging him to stop.</p> <p>He smiled as his finger found a place between her lips that was a bit smaller and wetter. He gently pulled her slit open and leaned in to kiss her inner lips. He slid his tongue down the length of her slitâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
