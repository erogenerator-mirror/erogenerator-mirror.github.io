She was staring at the door, her voice cracking.</p> <p>"Mornin' baby. I'm really sorry you had to go through that, but I'm glad it was you that got away from it. I missed you so much."</p> <p>"Oh God, baby. I really do miss you too. Tell me how you missed me. I want to hear you say it, ok?" He was still holding her in his arms, kissing her forehead, cheeks, chin. He could just imagine her smile as he ran his fingers through her hair, and up to pull the pins down the back of her face.</p> <p>"I don't know baby. I never really told you. I guess I never knew your Daddy. He... I don't know if I told you last year, but he's not even in college. It's his big night. I thought you'd love that. It's too bad he isn't coming to stay for his Big Night." He looked for some things he could do to help, but the girl's eyes were glued to his lips, "Please don't think I can help you with anything. I was just a little shocked, but... you were such a good friend to me. I wanted to see how bad of a thing you were, but you're the only one I know that talks to, about anything. Besides, I feel guilty about hurting you, even though I'm the one who did it!" He sat back on the sofa.</p> <p>"Oh god, baby. I'm so sorry I did hurt you. But you didn't hurt me. I knew I'd done something to hurt you, but it never happened. All those things I wanted to tell you, and I knew you would listen to me. I'd never put up with it."</p> <p>He was sitting there, his eyes a little redder than usual. When he noticed she was looking at him intently, he got the hint, and smiled. And just when he reached out and gave her a hug and a kiss, she said, "Yeah, it happened. But I love you so much, and you never did any of those things to me, and not before last year. I knew what you would do, but, no, I never meant to hurt you. I thought it was good to you that I was able to tell you.</p> <p>"You know, you can do anything you want to me. Just do whatever you want. Just do whatever you want to me." It was her turn to stare.</p> <p>"Baby, I want you... and everything. I love you. I love you, I trust you. I want to do whatever I want to you. Please tell me what to do. I want to do it, okay?" He nodded, "I want you to feel better, just feel like you want to be a girl, and a girl. I want to give you so much. It feels so good... I feel so comfortable about this. I've never felt like that before, and now I want you. Now, come sit with me."</p> <p>They sat in the living room, and he put his arm around her shoulder and looked into her eyes.</p> <p>"Baby, I want this, and I really do. I want you to know I really appreciate what you did to me, and I really do, so I'd like you to be my boyfriend, if you still feel that way. I really do. I just wanted you to know that." He pulled her closer to him, and looked at her deeply.</p> <p>"I hope so, sweetheart. I know you feel guilty for... you... to... do that. But, I feel so good to you. To have you as a friend. And I would like you to be my girlfriend, too. So I would be so proud to have you in my life. I don't want anything else except you being your girlfriend."</p> <p>"You have to hear that, baby. I love you. I really do. I really do." He leaned in and kissed her softly.</p> <p>"I love you, too and I want us to be happy together. I think you'd probably go to bed happy if you stayed here tonight. I think you ought to do that, and keep sleeping." She took his hand and placed it on her breast and rubbed it gently. 'I am going to take my clothes off, ok?' She nodded, and got up and opened the door again.</p> <p>"Baby, I'm going to take my clothes off, too. I'm going to turn the lights out, and I'll put them back on when we get to bed." As she turned around. He got up and sat beside her, and kissed his way down her neck, to her nipple, and he pulled on the little knob in her breast to get it up and started kissing her nipple, then went downâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
