At lunch, she handed me a sandwich, along with a couple of beers of his own. She had also arranged to meet his girlfriend at the bar. I was surprised to see that the girl had a very beautiful face with a little mole and large dark eyes. Her lips were full and red. I had heard the name of the owner's daughter, Elizabeth, but it was hard to place because she looked too old to be in the room. She was attractive. I had no idea what to do. After a bit of wine, she took my hand, led me back to her room. After the door closed, she said, "I got my brother's apartment. He said to be careful."</p> <p>"He doesn't live near you?"</p> <p>"Don't worry," she smiled. "I won't break him. I just need to get someplace where I can say goodbye to him and see him everyday."</p> <p>She went back to that, putting her head down for a moment. I sat on her bed while we talked. I finally said, "I'm not sure I trust this girl who knows everything about me. If I do, I would know everything about her." She put a finger to my lips. "Shush...Don't worry. When you are done, come over again." It was easy to picture her. She was very sexy in a very nice way with this girl's body. She has black hair; her light brown eye-shadow, and green eyes. Her breasts were large but they were not large. In my mind, I imagined them pressing against my body. Her breasts would be bigger and I would feel her nipples, her pussy if she did it as hard as I did. After a few minutes, she lifted her head up, looked me straight in the eyes and then spoke to me.</p> <p>"Do you like me, Dan?"</p> <p>The question caught me by surprise. It surprised me enough to want to answer, but not to let it go any farther. I had to think for a moment. "Yeah," I said, as quick as I could. "I do."</p> <p>"Do you trust me?"</p> <p>I thought about whether to answer her question. Should I? Maybe. Should I trust her? "Yes," I told her. "I really do." She looked surprised for a moment, but then let go of my hand.</p> <p>"Thank you," she said, "but then you would be so embarrassed if you did. I could see your eyes in my mirror. Do you like my body?"</p> <p>"Yes," I said quickly, I suppose, "but I think you're very sexy yourself."</p> <p>She turned around so that she could look into my eyes. "Do you trust me?"</p> <p>"Of course," I stammered, "I do. You're quite sexy."</p> <p>"Do you still want me to do this?" she asked, "because I thought about you, too, and I want to."</p> <p>"I'm sorry I asked this," I replied, "I really should leave now."</p> <p>"It's okay," she said. "Just go."</p> <p>"But," I said, searching her eyes for an answer, "I do want to be with you again, too--if you can accept it." For the first time in my life, I wanted someone to have a relationship with. I wanted to take her out on the town and give her a good time. I wanted to make love to her...to make love with her at the same time.</p> <p>"But I can't," she said, "I guess I'm too old." My mother would have told me what was going on but I didn't. She seemed kind of afraid. It worried me.</p> <p>It was a while before anyone spoke to me. After what seemed like a long day, I realized that mom was back at home. She had a meeting with her father, and I had a little too much to do with it. A little later, I went to talk to her over a glass of wine. I had already tried to tell myself that she was still at home because she was pregnant. I was still upset over what I had done, and that I shouldn't have done that to her, but I found it more reasonable than anything else. For the first time, my body was responding to her. It stirred up a desire inside. That had been the night before. That night, I had seen her, she had tasted her fingers on the one she had brought me. And now it was Sunday. I was very glad, really.</p> <p>Mom and dad had just left home when I got home. Mom was sitting at the kitchen table and I sat in my room.
