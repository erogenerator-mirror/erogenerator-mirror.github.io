I gasped.</p> <p>"No kidding."</p> <p>"Oh my God," I echoed.</p> <p>"Do you really want him."</p> <p>"I want him so bad, but I don't have to. I've already agreed to share me with you. I want both of us. I want to share myself with him."</p> <p>I could feel my face flush with shame.</p> <p>"You really don't know what you're talking about."</p> <p>"I know what I'm talking about, you silly man. Tell him."</p> <p>Now that it was coming into view, my cheeks were bright red and my eyes were glazing over as I looked for an answer. He had obviously seen something, and when I looked at him, he grinned, giving another devilish twinkle in my eyes.</p> <p>"You see?" he said and then dropped his gaze away from my breasts. "Look at the size of my penis."</p> <p>"How big is he."</p> <p>I didn't answer him, because I wasn't even listening to his words. I turned my head away from him. I knew it was turning him on. He grinned, and then dropped his eyes back to my breasts, again. I tried to look away, and then turned away again.</p> <p>"You want it."</p> <p>"Yesssss," I groaned.</p> <p>"Say it. Say I want his big hard cock."</p> <p>I didn't answer.</p> <p>He pulled me toward him, his hand running smoothly over my stomach, down to my cock, which was already beginning to swell. Then, I saw him lift his eyes back quickly, and his hand went to his crotch, grabbing at his cock, squeezing him hard, as he stroked himself. There was something more there, the feel of his hand on his cock, the way he could feel his cock move like that, the way it moved over his hand.</p> <p>"You want it," he repeated, and I still wasn't speaking. "You want my cock."</p> <p>I was silent. I didn't want him doing this. No one had ever talked to me like that before. I didn't want him to do this.</p> <p>"Say it out loud," I heard him say.</p> <p>I couldn't believe how forceful he had sounded. I wanted it so bad, but couldn't believe how turned on I was, knowing he was going to do this. He was already stroking himself with his other hand, and all the feelings from when I'd been talking to him were starting to intensify. His other hand reached up and grabbed onto my breast, squeezing it roughly, while he stroked himself, squeezing more and more, and I could feel my nipple beginning to harden. When he did it again, I thought I would burst, and he stopped, his hand sliding further down over my stomach and between my legs.</p> <p>"Oh, God," I whispered.</p> <p>"I want you," he growled. "I need your pussy, and yours."</p> <p>"Say it," he demanded again.</p> <p>I was almost in tears, but I didn't want to give in. I didn't want him touching me, because I was worried what if anything would happen tonight. And I was so wet, I wanted him to take me, and I was so desperate to have him inside of me, and I still didn't think I could give him what he wanted.</p> <p>"I want him," I whispered. "God, I want him. I want him inside me."</p> <p>"Then tell me, and I'll be inside you," he grunted.</p> <p>What do you say? Do you dare to say yes?"</p> <p>It seemed like it was more of the same, he was demanding, dominating, dominating and controlling, but it was true, I was helpless and it was like the power of his words came back to me. And I'd never said "no" to him before. It seemed like an extension of the words "no" to me. It was almost like saying "yes," but I still hadn't.</p> <p>"Say it," he urged me. "Say it."</p> <p>I knew I'd said the right thing. He did it without even looking at me, his eyes fixed on my breasts.</p> <p>"Say please . . ."</p> <p>He stared at me for what felt like an eternity, his eyes fixed on me, not saying a word, instead looking at me more intensely than ever before.</p> <p>"Please . . ."</p> <p>"Please what," he repeated. "Please fuck me. If you want to suck his cock, suck him."</p> <p>"You want to do that. Do you want to suck him. You want him to fuck youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
