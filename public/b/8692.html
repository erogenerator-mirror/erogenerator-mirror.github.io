After using the bathroom I take a quick shower. I take a second shower and put on my white terrycloth robe. A nice little black dress. I'm ready to leave when the doorbell rings. I've never been back in my apartment so the whole time I'm thinking how much fun my first trip to Baltimore might have.</p> <p>I take a quick look through the closet to see who is there. I didn't see anyone yet as he had not responded to my text when I left. I put on some black heels and grab my phone. I open a browser to see that it's from my friend from Maryland. So he's in Maryland too. He must be pretty lonely because I am feeling horny and really wanna fuck again. So I click on "hookup" and put on a black lace bra underneath the top of the bra. I put on a black thong with a garter belt and stockings.</p> <p>I'm looking at all these sexy things in front of the mirror when his phone rings. I answer in a sexy tone.</p> <p>"You are late."</p> <p>I smile at him and say "What am I so late for?"</p> <p>He laughs and walks over to me to say something. He kisses me as we kiss. My body is tingling with passion at his touch. I take his hand and lead him inside my apartment. I walk up the stairs and open my closet for a new outfit.</p> <p>Then I put on a white spaghetti-string top that is so short that it seems even skimpier around my nipples. It barely covers the front of my breasts. My nipples are poking a hole in the top. My bra cups push up on my C-cups and my breasts are spilling out of the top of the thin strap of the top. I make sure to put my hair back and blow it back softly, leaving my shoulder length hair wild. My long red-golden-brown hair comes just below my shoulders. I like how my short hair makes my hair look so damn sexy. I feel so sexy and sexy wearing that.</p> <p>When we get inside my apartment we get a beer. I take a seat on the couch. He sits on my desk chair beside it.</p> <p>"So tell me about yourself."</p> <p>"I'm your roommate and boyfriend. He was in an apartment complex. I've been to Baltimore and I don't really want to be in Baltimore with him."</p> <p>"Really? So why didn't you let him come back?"</p> <p>Just as he looked at my response I had his cell phone back to his phone. I know his wife was watching us in the house. I know she was masturbating. I smiled at him and said "Do you want to watch me fuck him again?"</p> <p>"Yeah," he replied.</p> <p>I reach down into my purse and throw him the cell phone. "So get in your pants and go fuck him!" I barked at him.</p> <p>"Well, there isn't much of a difference between watching your boyfriend fuck your friend in the video and you fucking him in my head. So what do you want me to do?"</p> <p>His response was to put my phone in his pocket. His cock was tenting his pants now and I looked on in awe. "I want you to put your things back on while I explain how to fuck my boyfriend in his apartment."</p> <p>He quickly went into the back room.</p> <p>"I'm gonna get in my car and walk over to my friends apartment. I will see if they come by the house. Then I am going to fuck your boyfriend in his apartment. Is that what you want?"</p> <p>"Yes." He replied.</p> <p>Before he turns around and walks back to his phone I notice a little box in his pocket.</p> <p>"Inside is the key." I tell him. He pulls one of the key cards out of his pocket, opens it and puts it back in the middle of the box.</p> <p>He looks at me with his green eyes and whispers with a smile "It was nothing."</p> <p>He starts walking off towards the side of the hall and I take his hand and lead him in his car to the elevator. I keep one of my shoes on the side of the elevator while walking to the lobby and we are both standing next to my car.</p> <p>Inside he looks around and says "I need a quick fix."</p> <p>I say "Let me help."</p> <p>He hands me a bottle of massage oil and says "Let me get that."</p> <p>With that I take hold of his cock and slowly rub it up and down. I take the tip of his cock in between my index and middle finger. I begin with just the tip and lightly tickle theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
