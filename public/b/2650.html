It wasn't a question.</p> <p>"No, you can't," she insisted, still holding onto him tightly with one hand over her mouth. He had the same look as she did when she was nervous, and the only reason why it wasn't a question was because she wasn't about to go off with him on the first date. She had some things to do today.</p> <p>"I think we should start out a bit," Mark began to tell her. It may sound strange, but he had no interest in seeing her do anything that might get him thinking about what it was he'd told her he'd been thinking about a thousand times while they were in bed together. It had been an idea that they had discussed several times in the past, especially in bed. They both took great pleasure in making it a daily event. It was just the sort of thing a long, active relationship would have to tolerate.</p> <p>"I want you to know that I'm not some random jackrabbit," she told him in a voice that was far beyond sweet. He nodded.</p> <p>"No, this is serious," he finished seriously. "You are not the only person I'm thinking about, really, no one but me could possibly think that we would..." She smiled at him, and his expression became serious again.</p> <p>"I know. I know," he said with great relief. "You should get a new car, if that's what you want to do."</p> <p>"No. I'm not interested in buying stuff," she said, looking back up at him. He could see relief in her eyes. 'It's not that you're not interested in buying stuff,' he thought. He nodded again. He was glad that this was where everything came up for them: the whole conversation, the car, the dinner, the friends, and then what?</p> <p>"Don't be silly, I'm just doing the one thing I've always felt comfortable having done in private," she said quietly. "There's no harm." Her hand was now still on his thigh, holding him tightly. "I trust you. I want to do this as much as possible. Whatever is going to happen tonight, you have the right to do with me as you want to."</p> <p>"Yes, Miss Evans. Whatever you want." Mark kissed her deeply, and felt her lips move against him in a very sexy, lingering kiss that she had so willingly opened up with as much as he had done.</p> <p>After that first session, they had done some casual things, but it wasn't until they were ready to be in bed that they made the first move. She felt so wonderful kissing him, and the whole intimacy was perfect. She got on her hands and knees, and looked back at him. "Come on," she told him. He looked back, and it was clear from the look in his eyes that he knew she wasn't asking him to do things, but to give himself as much as she was giving to him. He got on his knees and moved around behind her, taking her by surprise at the first touch of his mouth against the puckered entrance to her ass, before pushing in slightly.</p> <p>"Oh, yes, just like that," she exhaled. He took a deep breath before opening his mouth and making contact with her anus. "More!" she hissed, pushing out from her position behind her.</p> <p>Mark began his tongue lashing inside her ass, and she reached back and pushed to get him to go back up there more often. With his hands cupping her buttocks, he began to tongue fuck her as he had been doing during their first encounter. She could feel herself getting close to coming, and he sensed it too.</p> <p>"Please, Mark, I can't hold back much longer." She was breathing heavily through her nose as she pushed herself into his face. Her entire body ached for him to lick her, but he didn't. She was so ready for him to let loose in her that she didn't know how far she wanted him to go. She wanted more, but didn't want to scare him away, so she just kept her eyes locked on his, knowing he was too close to coming from the intensity of his tongue inside her. Finally when it felt like he was going to burst any second and had to let go in her, she gave in.</p> <p>As soon as he felt her begin to pull her ass cheeks apart, he put his hands around her and spread her open, giving him even more access to her asshole. He began to lap at her again as he pushed his tongue as deeply as he could into her as deep as he could as he felt her legs begin to spasm. He couldn't take anymore; it was time for him to make the most of the moment. He pulled her back as far as he could and began to tongue fuck her again. The sounds she was makingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
