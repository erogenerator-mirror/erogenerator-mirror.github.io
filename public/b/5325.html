She gently pulls it out and strokes it before taking a small bite of pre cum.</p> <p>"No not really"</p> <p>She puts her hand back to my lips.</p> <p>"I'm not sure"</p> <p>She is laughing at my expression.</p> <p>"I guess you do. You have a cock"</p> <p>My eyes go wide as I hear her say that. My head drops like a baby who's had to pee.</p> <p>"My brother is so big; maybe I should have let him cum on me".</p> <p>I lie there looking as if I'd cry if I were still a man still a man still a man. After a minute the realization hits me that I loved her and would do anything for her.</p> <p>She takes a long drink of wine from her glass. She leans over and kisses me full on the lips. Her lips are soft and I kiss her back. She's like the actress in the movie A Little Pain. Her tongue touches my lips. I reach up and kiss her lightly on the cheek. I can feel her hard body against mine.</p> <p>"I've only been with a boy once."</p> <p>"But I love him and want us to be together."</p> <p>She laughs. "We need to talk about this"</p> <p>My thoughts begin to drift again. I don't care if she's a real slut in real life she should be able to find her own way to it. She's the one that's been having the greatest time of her life with me. She's not asking anything. She's getting away from me without getting too involved; and yet still she'll think for her own pleasure.</p> <p>I think back on the night she was so happy and she was so happy, but I don't know what to think about it. I watch as she slides up again and lays down across the bed. My mind is still in a fog of lust. I'm not sure if I'd like to get my cock into her or not. I'm not sure if I'd want to give her back to a boy. I find that I'm still scared that she would want me. I never thought I'd fall in love and end up with some guy.</p> <p>She slides down the bed and climbs over me. She lays on top of me and kisses me again. I feel her hard nipples dig into my chest and her breasts sway back and forth. She kisses my neck down to my nipple and sucks it into her mouth. I'm thinking I love her. This woman wants me. I can feel her naked breasts pressing into me and my cock begins to move in response. Her wet pussy lips rub against my cockhead. It's not long before she is humping me and I can't hold back anymore. We roll onto our sides but the motion is so fluid at first it actually hurts a little.</p> <p>"You need to stop before we cum" her voice is so low I can barely even hear her words. She wants my cock in her? I don't understand because I can feel myself throbbing and I have a hard time moving. She kisses my lips lightly but not hard enough to stop herself from putting another load in me. I can feel the muscles within her pussy contracting and she is grinding her pussy hard into my cock. Suddenly I realize it's her and not her brother it's her! I begin to thrust and her pussy is so tight and hot. I hear the sound of flesh slapping together and her moans increase in pitch. She is thrusting her hips as hard and as fast against me as she could. Her breasts swing wildly in the breeze and she doesn't seem to care.</p> <p>She begins to moan loudly and I can feel her nipples swelling against me. I moan as her moans become more frequent and deeper. Then something happens that I can't really explain. It's like she shudders against me and suddenly the orgasm hits. I lose balance on the bed and my hips spasm and jerk. Every muscle in my body contracts and I moan loudly as wave after wave of pleasure hits me from one peak to another. I can feel my cock jerking in her pussy and she is crying out loudly in my ear. Our eyes meet and she smiles at me and then kisses me deeply on the mouth.</p> <p>We lie there for a long time as the warmth of this woman I'd just met flows through me. I've never felt so complete and content in my life. The feelings of love, happiness and happiness and happiness seem to always be there. We kiss as if it's right now and again we fall asleep in each other's arms.</p> <p>The next morning I get a text; it reads: "Sometime during the nightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
