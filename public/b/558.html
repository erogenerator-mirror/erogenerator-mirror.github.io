I think she felt it was something she wanted in her life because she was afraid to get the "I love the Army" thing. And when I said I loved the Army I meant it, as it meant for her and I. You know, I'm sure some of your friends talked to you about that. We don't talk about that. But there is one more thing."</p> <p>His tone of voice changed as he spoke and his eyes turned cold and he turned to the back of her naked body. "But I still don't think you're lying to me," she said in a surprised tone.</p> <p>"Oh you're lying too, are you?" he said, raising his voice again. "But we can't do anything about that anymore, can we?" His voice changed again. "I just think I should make sure we didn't do more than that, please? You can still go to your Dad's or do whatever you want with him, and we can do that for you. You get along with him now and he isn't likely to have another argument with you, can you?" He paused and thought for a moment. "Yes, but maybe he wouldn't feel the least bit angry with you. Wouldn't he? We might have to make sure. We should think of every good thing that comes along with making friends with his Dad. But if you think we can leave it right now then you're going to have to admit it was a very good deal on your part and make the choice again, and it is going to cost you."</p> <p>Dana stared at Jack, who was looking down at her with a blank look on his face. He stared out of the window, his hands folded in his lap, his arms resting around his knees, and Dana realized that she thought he was going to say something. Then as if she had not yet decided what to say, she slowly nodded her head in response, hoping that he could read her mind and decide what to say. When Jack finally looked up into her eyes, the decision was obvious on his face. He nodded and said, "Okay."</p> <p>"I love both of you very much, Jack, and it would be nice, and so would I, if you both had a good time today. Please don't worry about it. You could always leave, of course. Or you could just come back over here for a while and spend it together?"</p> <p>Jack nodded, not looking at her as he said it. "Okay then," he said. "I love you, Dana, but we all have to get through this together. Otherwise we won't get through it!" He leaned down and kissed her and they embraced, a long, wet, soulful kiss that both of them will remember for the rest of their lives, if they wish, because it brought with it an end to everything.</p> <p>Jack's cock was rock solid in his pants as they hugged and kissed and caressed each other for nearly an hour. His mind was still reeling from the thought of having Dana, naked against his leg, kissing him after they have been dating for a week or two, but his body was still in a constant state of arousal, as evidenced by the fact that his shorts were a little snug around his balls. He didn't want to give the impression that he had some desire for Dana or at any other woman, in his mind. He only knew that he wanted her, no need for her to say it, but to make love to her would also bring the end result to all they had together, one way or another. He was not sure yet whether it would be best to put it out of his mind that he made love to her while she knew that there was also a possibility of sex. But how will he explain it to her? It would be good for her to hear that he cared.</p> <p>And, when they finally pulled apart, and he could move again, he said, "I can't even imagine what you would think of that. I don't have any doubt." They looked at him and he smiled and said, "Just one. Do you have another place?"</p> <p>Jack said this to her and she said, "Yes, but if you say I need more room, then just go to your Dad's, that's fine. I can go take care of this stuff myself. If you want to join me out back for a few hours."</p> <p>Jack nodded and said, "I think I've got things to do, too, now, right here. I'd like you to join me for dinner tonight." With that he looked at her and said, "You're welcome to stay in the pool if you want. But I really don't want to be the first man you go out with on a date tomorrow. I just might be willing to share the pool.
