Everything was dark. The sound of the birds outside was muffled, but there was no sound from them. I picked up all the supplies I had brought from the garage and opened the door. I stepped back into the room and went to the stove. I was hungry!</p> <p>The refrigerator had all of the fixings in it so I grabbed a couple of cans and some beer. As I sat down at the table and sipped my beer, I could hear the music of the house come on. At least I wouldn't be getting kicked out.</p> <p>As I opened the cooler I heard the front door. I opened it to find the house empty. The last light on in the back was broken and I could see no sign of my brother Jack. He'd walked home. Now I knew why he needed a good hard working job to stay afloat. I knew I could use a good break so I went back inside to get some food from the fridge.</p> <p>When I walked down the stairs I heard Jack's truck come down the drive. The door opened and I saw the top and back of the house. I pulled out my cell phone and called his cell. After the fourth ring I had to be very specific and just ask him to come get me.</p> <p>"Jack", I said into the phone, "there's food in the kitchen and I need your help. I'll be right back!" I said laughing.</p> <p>Jack's truck came back into view and I opened the door. I had to use both hands to keep from falling out of the porch. When I got to the kitchen I turned on the light to see that Jack was still there. This is not what I had intended for him, it was more a joke. Now that I had Jack sitting naked on the bathroom floor, I thought that even he could still walk.</p> <p>I grabbed all the supplies I had left and followed Jack through to the kitchen. I took a small pot of cold water and got two glasses from the fridge. I handed one to Jack and took the other for myself. I knew he needed a shower so I got a bucket from the bathroom. I pulled up some towels and laid them on the counter in front of him.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" Jack asked as his eyes focused on me in the tub.</p> <p>"Why do you think you made me do this?" I said in return laughing.</p> <p>"I can't believe you did that," Jack said. "I've thought for a long time and you've never called me."</p> <p>"Don't worry Jack, I'm going to use that shower in the bedroom before I go in," I said with a smile.</p> <p>"I know you're sure, but I don't want to make you do something you'll regret later." Jack said. "I'm sorry I was such a tease. I don't want you to think that I'm some kind of slut." There was a big grin on his face as he leaned over to give me a hug.</p> <p>I could feel his hardon straining against his pants under the water and knew he was looking right at my breasts. "Jack, we really need to have a talk. Let's go take a shower."</p> <p>Jack reached up and gave me a kiss then got out of the tub and toweled off the last of the tub. Before I started to open the door his shirt was on the floor. Jack quickly started to remove the covers and pull them off before I could get anything in the way. By the time I had them down below and turned on to the shower, Jack was standing naked in front of me.</p> <p>"Let's go downstairs," Jack said as he grabbed my arm and pulled me out of the tub.</p> <p>The house was empty except for us, and as Jack started to grab his clothes from the bedroom, I told him, "I'm leaving my keys in the hallway."</p> <p>This was definitely embarrassing to Jack, but I knew it wouldn't go any further. "No Jack," I said and turned quickly to leave. I stopped as I got to a cabinet and got two more keys. "There's only one key, so we'll just take this one and we'll be on our own," I said.</p> <p>Jack picked up his clothes and walked out the door. I followed him as he got into his truck. Halfway down the drive, Jack began to drive back toward the garage. I watched entranced as he pulled close to a steel gate. Jack reached through the gate and pulled the van into the garage. As the gate swung shut behind him we heard a heavy slam of the gate. Jack turned in the mirror then I grabbed his face to hold onto. Jack turned to me and kissed me passionately. I pressed my lips to his, pressing my tongue into his mouth. When his mouth opened for me I reached down and lifted the front of his pantsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
