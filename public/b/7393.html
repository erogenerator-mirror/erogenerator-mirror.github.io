"I'm sorry." Again she looked up at me, "I've always had a thing about you," she finished as her eyes went to me, her face breaking once again. I could feel her staring at me, and her eyes were still big and clear, but her look was nothing short of fierce; it was as if I hadn't stepped out of anyone's life and replaced them. "I've always fantasised about being your girlfriend, about fucking you and making you come like you did me... I've always thought you were so much into me, that I could have you and I'd be happy to please you any way I could... it's my dream and I can't believe I didn't know it then but now I'm completely convinced."</p> <p>"Are you jealous?" I asked. "Because I'm you too, baby? Because you're my girlfriend? Because you're mine, huh? Don't be; don't you love me?" She stopped speaking, instead taking a deep breath. She pulled herself up to her knees, her arms still folded in front of her, waiting like a frightened child who had no idea what to expect. "This is what you want isn't it?"</p> <p>"Yes," I said, as if on cue. She stood and walked straight to me, her eyes staring into my eyes, her legs still wrapped around me, her arms around my neck. Her expression was pleading, trying to stay with me even though, if the moment was still before, she may have now. "Yes, I'm jealous," I said, as if to reinforce her determination. "But it's different to fantasising with whores like you," I finished, and I could feel her eyes following me. "It's not just about wanting to fuck them but about wanting to control them and make them do things they don't want to do."</p> <p>She gave me the puppy dog eyes again, like a little bitch that had just surrendered to her master. I was scared that she might get annoyed with me and come to my rescue and end this. "Because you have been my girlfriend for years." Her expression said it all.</p> <p>I laughed gently, but I did not take her back down. "Well I don't," I replied and it took me a moment before I realized I still had feelings as if I was falling for her. "But yes, I'm sure," I grinned, "It still feels a bit weird that you can make me come like that, especially with other people watching but, I'm sure you can find a good reason to be jealous." I could see the hurt and worry in her eyes, and the hurt was clear in hers. "I don't know what you're looking at," I said, as if speaking to her a friend, "but I can help you with a few things, please?"</p> <p>She looked away from me again, her eyes wide and serious. I felt as if I'd run a mile, I felt like I'd lost everything and that I'd broken everything in which I had it right and was going to get lost with her, as if I were a stranger from out of nowhere.</p> <p>Her expression took on a hard edge as she looked at me for the first time. Her eyes were cold and I started to fear it might be the first hint of defiance she would break, as if she'd just been caught naked and abused, but she couldn't take any more. This was getting too much to hope as her face suddenly went from one of determination and fear to a cold glower. With almost inhuman strength I pulled her back towards me and she started to run. I was right behind her and in a single movement I spun her around and kicked her over, knocking her to the ground. She took a scream of surprise but she didn't move, even with the kick to her stomach she was strong, despite the sudden fall I had to restrain her as best I could.</p> <p>"Stay down!" I bellowed again, and we both knew she had no intention of staying in this position, no doubt. I had always known just the right amount of resistance and had come to rely on how powerful was the will of my enemy; now I was the one who held back. I took a step forwards, but she couldn't move with me, as she was.</p> <p>I grabbed her legs and pulled her ankles into the crook of my arms, just as she had done to me, just as I had done to her. Her eyes were burning with fury, they were dark and wild. "I... I don't want you to leave..." she said, through her clenched jaw.</p> <p>"Fuck you," I saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
