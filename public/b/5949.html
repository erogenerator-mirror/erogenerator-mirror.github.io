Do you know who her husband is?"</p> <p>"No," he said, shrugging.</p> <p>"Come on, you guys. Now you're all getting ready."</p> <p>They looked at each other with raised eyebrows. They were all laughing at the idea of having sex with each other's wives, and now that they knew exactly what she had in mind, they all looked forward to her doing it with them. It was a game they'd always dreamed about. So much so they wouldn't even talk about it if they didn't know that they were doing it anyway.</p> <p>After several moments of looking at each other, they all broke out laughing again.</p> <p>"God, we've wasted enough of this game to be laughing at us," one of them said.</p> <p>"That was so stupid! We're all adults here and can't do anything. How come we're all here?" another one asked.</p> <p>"It's the best that ever happened to me," someone else said, and for all their honesty and seriousness, for some inexplicable reason, they all seemed to be falling in love with each other.</p> <p>"What do you want to do?" someone else asked.</p> <p>"Fuck each other,"</p> <p>"Jesus Christ," another said.</p> <p>"I don't give a shit. Fuck me with your big, strong fucking cocks!" one of them said, and they all laughed.</p> <p>They sat there staring at each other, still speechless. Suddenly, there was another round of laughter. They were all looking away now.</p> <p>"Do you think we could do that? We've never done it in our life. Do you know what that is?"</p> <p>"No," they each said, simultaneously.</p> <p>"I don't want a big, heavy fuck in our bed, or in our bed, and in our lives. I want this."</p> <p>"You would?" Another one asked, and they all looked down. A sudden inspiration occurred to them as they realized that they were in fact proposing a sexual act that was both a bit of a joke and really meant it. They got up and moved around to where their heads were level with each other.</p> <p>"That would be so sexy," another one said.</p> <p>They looked back at each other with a mixture of amusement and disbelief, and after a brief hesitation, they both smiled.</p> <p>"That would be the horniest shit I've ever put in my mouth," the one from the other side said.</p> <p>"You want to know what we would do with that information?" The other one said, and they both looked at each other and smiled.</p> <p>"I think it's probably gonna involve more than a little cock," the one from the other side added.</p> <p>"Fucking." Another one said, and they all smiled.</p> <p>"What would you say if we talked about what is what?"</p> <p>"Fuck! Yeah, I would, I would, the way you guys always say. Fuck." They all laughed louder.</p> <p>"Well then," one of them thought for a few seconds, and then he pulled his finger out of his mouth and moved over to the table where he picked up a pen and wrote something. He then turned to the other side and wrote something else.</p> <p>"I wrote, 'How is it that you can do that to me? I just want to try out what I've seen in porn!'," he said, and then looked at his wife, who had apparently gotten the idea after seeing what the other side had written.</p> <p>The two women smiled at each other again. She looked at him and they smiled at each other as they leaned forward and opened their lips. A minute later, the two of them were frenching each other with their tongues, slowly at first, and then they got more forceful. For several more minutes their tongues danced with each other, and the two of them were breathing laboriously into each other's mouths.</p> <p>After what seemed like an eternity, the two of them finally broke their kiss and pulled apart, letting their lips come to a rest. For several moments, they stared into each other's eyes, and then they both smiled at each other again and leaned toward each other again, and kissed again. This time they got a mouthful of each other's saliva that it then mixed with their saliva and the two women's saliva, and then they got more aggressive with their kiss. Their tongues quickly became more active, and their hands groped each other. First it was rubbing in unison, then they were feeling the other's hands on the other's body, sliding over each other's body. They made out for several minutes while watching each other kiss, and they could feel their hearts racing, their breathing even more labored, whichâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
