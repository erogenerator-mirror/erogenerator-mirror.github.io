He looked up and was startled to see her eyes closing. He waited until he was sure she didn't know he was watching her eyes and then asked as gently as possible, "Your name, I haven't heard it before."</p> <p>"Call me Nella." Her eyes snapped open. She was completely silent for a moment and then she smiled. "I love calling you honey."</p> <p>He leaned back, his eyes focused intently on her mouth. It opened again slowly, this time for a few moments...</p> <p>"Did you miss me?" he asked softly.</p> <p>This time, instead of opening her eyes, she smiled again. "I missed you, too." She smiled again, and the smile left her lips this time.</p> <p>"I don't know about you," he said simply, "but I'm ready to fuck."</p> <p>"I want you to fuck me, so bad," she said as she looked down at his cock for the first time. Her expression changed...</p> <p>"Well, you're still not ready for me... yet," he said with a wink as he reached for the condom. "I know I'm not very big, but you'll be fine, honey. I'm not going to push too hard this time."</p> <p>"I want you in me, like this," she said, and he smiled. He watched as she took his cock in her hand and aimed it carefully at her pussy a split second before she lowered herself onto him. He felt the heat of her body envelop his rod and slid easily in. Her eyes closed, she moaned, and they kissed once more. He reached for her ass, spreading the cheeks with both hands.</p> <p>His fingers found their way around her pink hole. He watched as she began to rock her body back and forth, her tits shaking as he fingered her puckered hole. She moaned in pleasure as he pushed her up and down, his cock sliding deeper into her. Her tits were swaying as she humped him. He took her hands off her ass and put them on his shoulder. He was so turned on by the idea of their coupling.</p> <p>"Tell me you love it," he said as he placed her hands back on the sheets. He grabbed her waist and she raised up on all fours before taking him all the way into her body again.</p> <p>Her breath came out in short bursts and her eyes held his as she took him fully in. Her body was so tight, her pussy squeezing him with each thrust so full and full. After several moments, she looked back at him. "I love your cock," she said in a small voice.</p> <p>"I love fucking your tight pussy Nella." He began to thrust into her with more force.</p> <p>"Oh, yes baby. I want it to feel good." She was breathing faster and her body seemed to twitch more. She was moaning now, and as he fucked her, he couldn't help but reach down and stroke her clit. She moaned in pleasure again. They were still making love, but it was slow... slow and very sensual. It was clear that this wasn't what he wanted... or needed. He wanted to hold her close and be in bed with her all night. His mind kept replaying the images they'd just exchanged before his mind drifted back to her words which were so sweet and so beautiful.</p> <p>He felt her body begin to tremble and the telltale ripples started in her abdomen and her whole body began to quiver again. She reached down and began to caress his chest, feeling the muscles in his body start to quiver as well. He continued to fuck her for quite some time before he looked up at her face. She kissed him for several moments as she reached up and started to rub at his chest with her fingers. He looked down at her eyes closed. "Oh, Nella." He closed his eyes and smiled. "I'm going to cum!"</p> <p>"Give it to me, baby." The words rang in his head all over again as he felt her cunt tighten around him. He had never heard her use that kind of language before, nor had he ever thought of that before, but the way it sounded to him made him want it... wanted it badly.</p> <p>He felt himself begin to lose control. He continued to thrust into her, but his body was already tensing all around him. He was fucking her as she was fucking him, and he loved it. "I'm going to cum... oh... I'm going to cum." He pulled out of her before he had a chance to tell her she was making him cum. He turned to kiss her and saw she was smiling. She moved up and his cum splattered into the air before she had a chance to closeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
