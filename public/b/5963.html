"We've been together and we still love each other with all the passion and desire we've been feeling for our marriage, but nothing has happened. We talked and we decided to make love until we decided that we wouldn't do this," she spoke with an excited look. "We want more."</p> <p>My heart soared as well and at first I wanted to say no, but when my mind began to wander, I decided that I wasn't going to let it be the same as it was before. But the woman beside me was more than aroused and she moved so that her pussy made contact with mine.</p> <p>I was mesmerized by her soft curves as she lay on the couch. I'd never seen her this way before as her soft hair slid over the exposed sides of her breasts so as each inch of her skin rubbed against my own, I felt every crease of her body and the gentle bumps of her nipples. Her arms lay down on my sides and my hand cupped the curve of her hip. I was overcome with desire.</p> <p>"Mmmm, he liked that too," she said.</p> <p>"Really?" I responded.</p> <p>"Yes. I've wanted you to touch me all the time and now, I really, really want it," she said as her lips brushed my upper chest for several seconds. "Let me do that," she pleaded with her eyes. "We can let it happen to a stranger. Let him feel you too."</p> <p>"Oh, but I love you," I moaned as she drew her lips down my stomach. "You've made me horny," I added.</p> <p>Her skin on my stomach felt soft and smooth to my touch. I ran my hand over her back and over her shoulder before slipping one hand down to her breast.</p> <p>"A bit more," I moaned. "This can be great."</p> <p>Her mouth made that sensuous sound once more before she began to trace down my stomach and then up to my cock before moving up and over my stomach in a circle, her tongue tracing its way from the base of my dick, back down again, over my balls and then back up under my cock and finally back up again over the tip of my dick.</p> <p>"You are so sexy," I said. "I can't believe how good you feel right now," I added.</p> <p>Susan leaned forward and began to kiss and suck on my earlobe as she slid a finger around the base of my cock while continuing to stroke the tip with her thumb. In moments, she had my entire length encased in her mouth while I lay back, my legs splayed and my cock deep, watching the woman that I loved so much, bobbing up and down on my cock.</p> <p>"Let him feel you as you take your first real cock," she said, her hands massaging a small handful of pre-cum in between her fingers. "Let him feel you as you slowly, beautifully, fuck him with your mouth."</p> <p>I'd never felt more comfortable that way. The way Susan was talking to me and encouraging me to take her pussy and make it mine and in fact, all this was just too much. Yet, once or twice I felt the electricity of a woman toying with my penis as I watched her suck on it for all she was worth. I was not the only one who was excited. The anticipation of what may be just a little more than three or four inches of cock was making me wild.</p> <p>My hips were trying to lift my hips off the couch almost as soon as I felt the hotness of her mouth enveloping my cock. I wanted to do the same for her. It was all I could do to refrain from doing that while I could still feel the pressure of her mouth on my dick. But all too soon I felt her mouth stop just shy of the head.</p> <p>"Okay," I said. "Let's do this properly."</p> <p>I took in a deep breath of relief as she slowly raised up her head and looked me in the eyes.</p> <p>"I know this will hurt a little," she said. "But we've both been practicing. Let me try it again."</p> <p>Her hand grasped my cock and she leaned forward. I felt her tongue licking and probing at the tip as she lowered her head and felt the head of my cock against the back of her throat. She slowly lowered her head, but stayed there for a few seconds.</p> <p>"I love you, I really love you. I really love you. I want that to be as pleasurable for you as it will be for me."</p> <p>We both let out a little sigh of contentment as we sat on the couch, kissing and caressing each other's bodies. The feel of a woman's hands stroking my body was unlike anything Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
