"Nah, I don't know if I like it better out in the middle of town."</p> <p>"Not at all? That's a shame. Now, what's the name?"</p> <p>"Hm, well I'm a good guess, but let me guess. It may be right over here. "</p> <p>"Right over here?" he said, grinning. "I'm not sure about this, we're on your side here. Are you sure you haven't done something like this before?"</p> <p>"Well, yeah... I've had a bit of a hard time looking at older women, but then... what guy doesn't like to go back to the woman he saw in his dreams after all these years?"</p> <p>"I bet you'd feel better out here in the middle of the summer."</p> <p>"Yeah, I think I do." She said. "Let's go."</p> <p>Drew was having a good time, too, when they got back to the condo. At one point he had some ideas, and decided to take her up on what she was saying. After all, she was clearly feeling comfortable, but he wasn't. He was still going to keep it, but he wanted to be clear about who he liked when he felt like that, as well as who he didn't... But after walking in on a woman in his bedroom, he couldn't imagine not looking. Maybe he needed the reassurance some other time. And maybe tonight.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>For that matter, Drew was a pretty good guess. If you're thinking about it, then let's just say that the guy isn't a jerk, and you aren't the other guy. But when it came time for you to feel safe and loved, it's almost unheard of that you could go all out in whatever it is you feel. When you walk in on a woman in her room alone on the night before, it doesn't always get you a heart attack or anything and that's not a good thing. It's a real pain to feel that alone.</p> <p>Drew and Jen had been married for about a few years. A couple of months earlier Jen was the one who had decided to take his advice and go to LA. As they got used to it, they were comfortable with each other. They dated out at college, got married, and got started at the same time. They got divorced at the age of nineteen, and the three of them began their life together.</p> <p>Drew started working on a major project when Jen came home from work the next day. She had her work cut out for her, and had no need of being home anymore. At first it didn't hurt that her work schedule didn't allow for much time to go by before Jen came home from work, but the fact is, she usually ended up home by twelve thirty. After all, she was at work, and not able to have anything to do.</p> <p>When Jen was finished with her work, she was surprised and pleased by Drew's work, and the fact that he was really able to do a number that could easily be considered a joke and a joke. The man was quick and efficient and very pleasant. At least he'd kept up right from the begining. He was a pretty decent looking guy, and that got her feeling confident and excited to meet him. She had to admit that she liked what she saw when he sat down with her in my life. The way he did things with her, everything he did, it felt like he was someone who lived and breathed his life.</p> <p>Jen also found her attraction to the guy's body to be an attractive thing, as well as her first lesbian experience, and if she had to be honest with herself she liked what she saw. In the beginning, she wanted to see what it would be like to fuck him until he came, and as their dates got older she was getting quite aroused and getting the distinct impression that she wanted to have sex every night.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>"Well, I see you're not feeling very well?" Jen asked Drew after they came home from our date.</p> <p>Drew was laying on the couch at Jen's couch, sitting down with her and resting on top of her. As usual, he kept his weight off.</p> <p>"Well, I'm not sure how long it will take before anything will happen. You know I'm in the process of getting a lot of work done, I guess. But in time I'll come to see you," he said with a grin. "But right now, I just need to relax and think about how things will play out."</p> <p>Jen rolled off of the couch, sitting down on the floor on the other side of him. "Well, I'm not sure about how we've kept it goingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
