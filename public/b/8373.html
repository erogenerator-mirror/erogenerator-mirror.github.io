A new orgasm started to build in her body. She reached over to the kitchen counter and began to stroke herself. She was still thinking of the night before. She had only masturbated herself once before and it had been very intense. She didn't know how much more she could take. She reached her clit and rubbed it. She started to rub faster and faster. She knew she was about to cum. Just when she thought she couldn't stand the need anymore, she pushed down her finger and began to spray cum all over the place on the kitchen floor. She was completely out of control. Her body started to convulse. She reached into her purse and pulled out some tissues to wipe herself off. She looked over at herself in the mirror and looked at her cum soaked face. She tried to get her breathing under control but she was so sensitive. Her eyes were closed and she was having a hard time focusing on her feelings. Her breathing was hard and long. As she looked at her stomach in the mirror, she realized that was making her feel very sore.</p> <p>"What's the problem?" she said through clenched teeth.</p> <p>"It just hurts a little," she said. "This morning, yesterday, and today. It just goes away. I'm just trying to enjoy myself with this," she said trying to explain.</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"I'm not enjoying it like you do. I just don't like to feel like that when I'm really trying to enjoy myself. If you're not enjoying it, then why do you think I let it end?"</p> <p>"I don't know. I probably don't enjoy when I try to enjoy it with someone I just met. I usually just do it once. That's not what makes me different."</p> <p>"Just don't let it end."</p> <p>She just started trying to tell me something that she'd had to be taught when she got married. She didn't think she would ever understand what was happening to her. She just didn't realize that it was an experience that could be repeated.</p> <p>"It's going to be alright." she said trying to console her.</p> <p>"Can I stay?"</p> <p>"Not tonight. Your husband is out of town. He won't be back for another hour or so. You are exhausted. You've had a big day at the office."</p> <p>"You're really getting off on it? Why?"</p> <p>"Because you're so pretty and you're happy. You make me feel beautiful. You're so hot!"</p> <p>"I have to lie to you. I'm so tired, that I can't even masturbate."</p> <p>"Maybe you should try. We will just go to sleep together." There, she said it. She wanted her life to be different. She just didn't want to sleep alone. She had never been one to talk back. She didn't like being close with people. "Maybe." she said, hoping she wouldn't get cold feet again.</p> <p>The next morning, she woke with the sun coming through the kitchen window. She started to get up but remembered she had to get up, before her husband came back. She sat up and stared out the window into the late afternoon sun. She had to get up. She decided she couldn't do it right now. Instead, she sat up and gazed out at the sky. She wanted to make love but was concerned that if a part of her didn't participate, she would go nuts.</p> <p>By the time she finished watching TV, it was 3:30. She got up and changed into something more comfortable. She went to get dressed but found her pants still on the floor in the bathroom. She decided to walk back to her husband's room. She wondered if he had fallen asleep already though. She hoped she'd hear him moan when she got to his room.</p> <p>Finally, he came out wearing a T-shirt. She just stood there for a minute. She couldn't stand it. She walked over and slowly walked toward her husband's room. While she sat down, she started to kiss him. They sat there kissing for a minute. Then, he broke off. His tongue flicked into her mouth, and his hands stroked her stomach. She could tell he was still hard from that morning. She pulled his shirt off and they made out again. It was very quick, but it didn't bother her that she wanted to do it again.</p> <p>She lay down on his bed and he started moving down. She moved down off his bed and stood up. She walked toward his door. While she was heading back to her husband's room, she leaned over and kissed him. She opened his shirt and started to work on his buttons.
