His hands roved her back, and as she rubbed him over his pants she managed to undo several of the buttons, which she had not managed before.</p> <p>"What a delightful surprise," she whispered into his face.</p> <p>She reached and felt his hardness pressing against her fingers, but did not really do the deed. She was surprised by the sensation she got from just a mere touch. "Your penis is very hard," she told him when she did move to kneel there on the chair, "perhaps I should have done it my way."</p> <p>"Now, I'm surprised I have the nerve to do a thing like that," he said without thinking.</p> <p>As he was thinking about it, she removed his pants and boxers very quickly, almost falling to the floor in his excitement.</p> <p>"Ooooh, it is hard again," she teased, holding the length of him at the base before moving down to stroke him through his pants and onto her breasts. "What can I do with this?" she asked coyly.</p> <p>"It is hard to put in a place where you don't get an eyeful," he laughed. "Oh, I do love your breasts, they are so lovely."</p> <p>"Perhaps it will be OK, since I have been watching you in the bath," she said innocently in his ear, her face closer to his face.</p> <p>It seemed natural that they should both be kissing and hugging and cuddly and kiss-y the way they had done last night at her wedding. His cock was as hard as it would get and she enjoyed having him between her legs. She slid up his body and stood on the balls of her feet before kneeling to remove his pants. Standing there she let him feel her breasts, not as if they belonged to his wife, but just as she had.</p> <p>"This time we will kiss first – then perhaps I should do everything else," she whispered as she kissed the head of his cock. It was big and it seemed so sensitive that she was surprised that she could not get all of him inside her.</p> <p>"Would you like to show me your first proper climax, before I take any more?" she asked and it was true.</p> <p>"I wouldn't have asked you to!" he laughed as he rose to his feet and led her to the bedroom by the hand. "It will be our night to remember," she smiled, her hand on the knob of his cock and leading the way.</p> <p>In that moment the whole world seemed to have taken on an extra-special meaning for her. She was aware of the hardness that it was giving her and it seemed such a strange and exciting touch, not the touch of a man but of a woman, she thought. Her body seemed to want something, as she moved with urgency but what it could do for her, for the moment, was all she knew. She had given herself up completely to the sexual pleasure that it was allowing her. Her heart was pumping at such a level it felt as though it would never go down until it had to and she shuddered as if she were running to the end of the world. He was moving with her now, slowly at first and then with firmness. And it was happening, like an ocean wave coming down on the ocean shore with a new, almost undimmed sense of awareness.</p> <p>"Oh, oh," she called into the air.</p> <p>"It is coming," she called. "I want some kind of pleasure now," she whispered. "Don't you want to come in front of me? I am so excited!" Her hands moved to him and she pressed her breasts against his chest while she moved, rubbing herself up and down the sides of his shaft.</p> <p>"I'd rather come, for you I want to come for you. Do you want to come for me then? I want to show you my love!"</p> <p>"Can I come for you, now?" she heard herself asking and she knew she was asking as a woman. She pulled away from kissing him. She looked up at him and said, "But hurry!"</p> <p>They had not talked in the car that morning, but as they kissed and caressed each other they were in a moment of sexual ecstasy and the thought never ceased to send chills up and down her spine. It seemed so real and right at the same time as it was.</p> <p>"I want to kiss you, now," she whispered again and the kiss they had started with broke away.</p> <p>"Where are we going?" he asked.</p> <p>"I'm not sure," she replied with a grin. "In your bedroom there are three bedrooms," she added—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
