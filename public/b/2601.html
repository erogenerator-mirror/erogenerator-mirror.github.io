Michelle asked.</p> <p>"What?" I asked back.</p> <p>"Oh god, just that kiss." Michelle said with a smile.</p> <p>I sat there, dumbfounded as she sat on the bed with her feet on the floor, looking me up and down.</p> <p>"We really shouldn't be doing this." she said.</p> <p>"What?" I repeated my question.</p> <p>"Don't touch me," she said, her eyes darting to my dick and I could still barely move.</p> <p>"What's there?" I asked looking down from her eyes.</p> <p>"I thought we should be doing it." she told me.</p> <p>"It's wrong," I told her.</p> <p>"I know it is," she said.</p> <p>She reached out and touched my dick lightly.</p> <p>"No," she said. "You're not just here, you're in my mind, it's all I think about you."</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'm on fire for you. So I'm willing to go farther, if that's your wish." said my wife, looking down and stroking her hand across his swollen shaft.</p> <p>"I would do anything for you," she said, looking up at me now, her eyes half watching me look at her than looking at him.</p> <p>She started to kiss my cheek again, then her lips moved closer and her tongue swirled over my lips. I closed my eyes and kissed her, my tongue slipping out to touch her as she pulled away.</p> <p>My cock was as hard as it'd ever been. I moved my hand to her stomach and gently moved it up her stomach, moving down to her breasts. He she let out an involuntary soft moan as I brushed her nipples. I found her lips and kissed her gently. I pushed her back down onto the bed so she would lie on her back. I was kneeling back on our feet, my legs straddling hers and moving to get lower. I kissed her passionately, pressing my tongue into her mouth. The kiss was long and our tongues danced over each other. She had her hand down on the back of my head, squeezing me as we kissed. I slid my hand down her stomach and found her slit, my fingers sliding over her lips, finding them wet. She pushed her hips up to my hand and my fingers found her clit. I rubbed it as my tongue moved in and out of her hot mouth.</p> <p>I heard her moan around my tongue and she pulled me down so our faces were touching. He she pushed my hand down under her skirt. I felt her panties being pulled aside and I pushed my finger into her. I could see her opening me up as I worked my finger in and out of her wet hole, sliding up and down. I continued to move my finger in her until she pushed my hand from her and moaned, her legs still wide apart. I couldn't understand all the sounds our mouths were making and I kissed her all the way down to her breasts. I sucked on the hard nipples, feeling them swell under my mouth. I slid my tongue down to her belly, pulling up her pants and moving them to the side. I could still see her beautiful body as she lifted my head up to kiss me. My hands explored her body as she moved hers down and I slid my hands into her panties, rubbing her clit, feeling my wife's hands move up to find mine on her breasts. I couldn't believe what I was seeing in front of my eyes.</p> <p>My dick was rock hard and was pressing against my jeans as I moved in between her legs. Michelle was panting, her legs splayed open and her pussy lips so swollen she could be seen by anyone sitting in front of us.</p> <p>"Oh you're so beautiful." I moaned.</p> <p>"I can't wait to," Michelle said.</p> <p>I slipped my cock under her leg and looked at it and couldn't believe she's talking like that.</p> <p>He she had me so hot I could stand it any time.</p> <p>"I want you," she said.</p> <p>"I want you too." I said. "I'll leave my pants on."</p> <p>My wife was looking at me, her hand under her skirt, her face flushed and smiling. I kissed the top of her knee and my mouth found her again, my hand reaching up to rub her clit.</p> <p>"No, I can't." she said.</p> <p>"What's wrong?" I asked.</p> <p>"I want you," she said as she raised my head up so she could look me in the eye again. "I want you inside, I want your hard dick, I want you to come, I want to look at you, I want to feel youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
