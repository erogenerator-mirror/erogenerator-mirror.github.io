I have to go to the office. Go to this party next week. We are having a great time. I've missed this place."</p> <p>I nodded and he put the phone down. "You can go. I just want to get a drink before I go home."</p> <p>"It would be nice. I need to get back to work," she replied, "I'll try not to say that."</p> <p>"Of course you will. Now come on. This party is just a little after six."</p> <p>I told them how I had told him that last evening and the fact that I wouldn't be in until later in the week, but they agreed that I should have the whole evening free. They insisted that I join them for a drink and I did. We sat around and had a few beers and talked. She told me that I would only have the night free if I agreed to attend the party. She also explained that she had to go back to work early the next day. It was still only the past week and I couldn't go for another drink. We finished our beers and I drove them home. I got home and was shocked to see that the house had a new front entrance. I could have gone back home. They had never made such a huge show like this before. It was just so strange. They had never come out the door for that long. I just had to go and get home. I went straight up to my room and changed into jeans and a t-shirt. I went out on the patio and sat around for a few hours. The sun was shining and a breeze played with the small branches that flew through the air. I drank a lot of wine and was feeling a little buzzed.</p> <p>When I walked into the house it looked very strange. A lot of people were out there. I found a spot to lie down and I turned on my iPod. I was feeling very mellow. Soon a band started and a lot of people started to come out in the front yard that I had a hard time seeing, but couldn't get in the front as I was getting up.</p> <p>"Don't turn up out here alone," I said to my new friends, who came over and joined me in the pool. Several women sat in the grass and I looked around. There were three or four couples sitting in the lawns. I also saw several couples playing tennis. I knew that they were enjoying the show. I thought to myself that this couldn't get any more strange or uncomfortable. Soon more people came out in the front yard and the noise of the party went away. I don't know what had gotten into me, but just knew that it was wonderful. I felt wonderful.</p> <p>After awhile people started to gather around the pool. I stood up and saw my new friends standing in the shadows right where they were. I had a wonderful time. They were sitting in the grass chatting and I kept looking over at them as they sat there listening to music. I couldn't help but glance at the two of them. I felt very happy and very sexy as I was looking at them. I didn't like this.</p> <p>Just as they had started chatting about something my new companions had to leave. I walked to the back entrance and walked out. A couple of guys and a girl sat on deck chairs around the pool and the girls stood. I went to one girl and sat her on my lap. She felt very small next to me and kissed my neck. Her hands felt all over my body and I knew we were getting to the point where we would do anything we wanted to do so just stay the night. I kissed her and we spent about 15 minutes making out. One of the guys came over and sat on the bench next to me. He got on his knees and started sucking on my nipple. He was so sexy with his mouth on me. I reached down and felt his hard cock and was surprised to find it huge. He stood up and walked over to her and took off her dress. She was naked and he knelt and took off his pants and underwear. He was a big black guy with a nice big cock as he stood up and entered her with no thought for her pleasure. He started to fuck her hard and fast and she was groaning loudly with each thrust. They were getting into it as I watched them.</p> <p>After they came I saw the guy pulling her legs so they were touching his sides. She kept crying out with each thrust. I got off the bench so I could watch. She moved around so that her pussy and his cock were in me. She leaned her head back so she could kiss his neck. His cock kept sliding in and out of me as I looked over at them. We kept going at it and I was getting close but not as close to cumming as I had been. Suddenly he cried out with his last thrust as he came. I felt his juices spurtâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
