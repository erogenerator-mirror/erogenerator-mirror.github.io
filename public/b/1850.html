He moved his free hand to her right breast and took a nipple between his finger and thumb and then pulled on it gently as he lowered himself forward letting her feel his shaft begin to move.</p> <p>"Ahh, don't just stay like that, put it in, let me feel you moving." she said with an urgent note in her voice. When he moved his penis down to her vagina she slid down over it and took it into her vagina as deeply as she could. She could feel the ridges that ran all along the shaft as it glided into her vagina and down the inside of her leg, and even inside his. She felt an instant of warmth and wetness as his penis slowly slid in and out of her.</p> <p>She felt her vagina being stretched and then relax as he entered her. She felt the tightness of her vagina begin to engulf his penis as he slid further into her. Her head lifted up from the pillow as she let her body become accustomed to the size and width of him. The warmth he felt inside her had made her body feel warm and she was feeling it spread on her body making him feel as good as he could. His penis was in her way and soon she felt it begin to grow again. She felt her vagina begin to tighten around him and her clitoris began to tingle as it began to press up into his lower abdomen and she felt the tingle of the beginning of an orgasm. She opened her eyes and looked into his and they both smiled. This was a first and they both wanted it to last forever. The thought crossed her mind that it might be a lot longer before she would be able to perform again.</p> <p>They rested for several minutes. She felt him harden and get hard again and she could not even feel him, but she was so turned on that she could not be quiet. She looked at him and could not resist reaching down and running her hand along his thigh. He smiled and lifted his penis up to her face. Without hesitation she took his penis in her mouth and began stroking it up and down gently, looking up into his eyes as she did so. She was looking at his eyes in the way that an animal looks at its prey, and he was gazing down into hers.</p> <p>As the tempo increased, she took his penis deeper into her mouth. He felt as if he should not be touching himself. As he felt her hand caressing him, he began to move his hips up toward her, causing his penis to rub against her clit. She sensed his penis becoming hard again and as she felt him begin to slide into her, she began to slide her body up and down his, sliding her hips up and down while their mouths held each other.</p> <p>She was a quick learner. His penis was now sliding in and out of her and her vagina was becoming slick with her juices. She knew that they would not be able to last much longer. She wanted his penis again and they moved down the bed till his penis slipped from her to fall beside his body. She smiled at him and took his hand to guide him down to lay next to her.</p> <p>He knew what she wanted him to do and he placed his hand on her belly, touching her skin. She smiled and reached her hand to caress his penis. He slid his hand up and down her belly feeling the softness of her skin. Each stroke of his hand on her skin made her tingly inside. He began to move his hand up and down her naked body feeling the feel of her as it grew warm with desire.</p> <p>"I want to feel you next." he said with excitement in his voice.</p> <p>"Just lie down" she said with a smile.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes." she replied as she turned toward him and reached her hand out toward his penis. She gently touched the tip and he raised his hips as she pulled his penis toward her and lowered herself to him. She felt his penis slide into her, and they lay there together as she stroked him and felt the first of his ejaculations. She felt him begin to pulse as he held his penis still inside her as he looked into his eyes. When his penis began to slide out it made contact with her hand and she knew that she had him. She felt her legs spread apart and her vagina opened and closed like a glove around his penis as she felt him slide into her.</p> <p>She felt him beginning to slide back and forth inside her. She began to slide more up and down over him, feeling the warmth of her body as it moved against his. She felt her vagina being stretched and she wanted to know his penis inside her again, and she beganâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
