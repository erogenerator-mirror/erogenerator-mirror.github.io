I hope they didn't mind my dress." she added to try and defuse the situation.</p> <p>His face light-heartedly gave her hope to not be upset by it. But his voice was definitely filled with sadness and disappointment as he asked her to get dressed. He pulled his robe off of his body leaving him in no longer than a flimsy nighty as he moved to untie her, taking his time to get her to remove it.</p> <p>"Can you come down for breakfast, I have a lot of things to do in the store. Then have your lunch with me." he suggested.</p> <p>"You mean with the girls and then we all went for our meal out in the parking lot...I am sorry, I can't." she said looking down a little. But he took her hand and led her to the back of the house where there was a picnic table and a small cooler. She thanked him for his hospitality.</p> <p>"Your welcome to join me. I am sure you will enjoy all I have done for you." he said then pulled her into his arms and leaned down to kiss her softly. "I want you to enjoy this night a lot." he said as he held her tighter as their kisses grew in passion. Finally he let go then walked her to the picnic table. He poured of the hot water for them both and then helped her climb out of her dress.</p> <p>"Come with me to the picnic table I will turn on an outdoor shower." he said to her as he sat. "I am sure there will be people here to wash you when your are ready." as he held her tightly.</p> <p>She could have cared less about what this situation was, to have him kiss her when she looked up at him was all she could ever hope to have. When he walked the two of them to the end of the picnic table, she could have looked up at him as they walked; instead she saw him grab the soap and start lathering her up.</p> <p>When it came to washing her she let him take all the time, the next thing she knew she was sitting on the picnic table, his face between her knees in front of her pussy, one hand working her soapy body. She had never felt anything like it before. He then took a razor and started shaving her, with his hands as he moved out around the table to work on her tits. She felt so smooth under his hands that when his fingers brushed her nipples they became hard and erect.</p> <p>He spread her legs with his foot and gently slid his hand under her ass as he reached under his leg to play with her pussy. He could feel her juices flowing and knew he would have her cum in no time. She let out a moan when he took his fingers and rubbed over her clit. When he rubbed his hand over her nipple again she went wild with her legs clamping around him to keep him in place and he made sure he moved his tongue back to her clit.</p> <p>When he felt her body beginning to tense from the tension he continued to slowly move his fingers over her clit, then up and down, then back to her pussy. Her muscles tightened and she pulled his face tightly down to her pussy, moaning into his mouth as he slowly slid a finger into her wet hole. He could feel her muscles squeezing his finger as she began to cum with another orgasm. When he felt her body relaxing he moved up her body, turning her around on the picnic table and gently kissed her lips as he began to slide his cock back into her wanting pussy.</p> <p>He loved feeling her legs surrounding him and as he began to fuck into her as hard and as long as he could. She looked up at him, feeling his weight on top of her. He could see the pleasure on her face as she watched him fuck.</p> <p>He knew she was about to cum again and this time he wasn't satisfied and picked her up into his arms. Holding her body against his he began moving his hard cock in and out of her wanting pussy with the same pace. He loved the way she felt with her legs wrapped around his neck pulling him into her as she pressed her hips backwards to meet his cock in her and could feel his balls against her ass as he began to pound his cock into her pussy from behind and could feel her cum in his balls and cock.</p> <p>When their orgasms finally finished she was looking up at him and he was looking down at her. "I love you." she said to him as they kissed passionately. Then he pulled his cock from her and rolled off of her as she looked up at him surprised.</p> <p>"Did you need that?" he asked her, stroking herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
