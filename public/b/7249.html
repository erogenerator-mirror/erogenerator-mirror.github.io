The waiter cleared his throat a little. "We hope to see you again in two weeks. I'll have some menus placed on the table." He walked over to her and took my hand. "Oh, by the way, my name's Josh. Welcome." He smiled and left.</p> <p>"You know, you really did great tonight. I'm sorry you'll never see me again," she said. "The waiter never even smiled at you."</p> <p>"Don't be," Mike replied. "I can't believe that you wouldn't just take the time to talk with me. I really did appreciate it." He smiled at her, then added, "But you're the best wife in the world."</p> <p>"Oh, Mike," Kayla said. "You're so right!" She leaned over and kissed him. "You really are handsome. I'm so lucky to have you!"</p> <p>"So am I. We're gonna have some wild times," he said. He turned to us and asked, "Will you go on a picnic or something?"</p> <p>"Yeah, of course," Kayla said. "But why?"</p> <p>We talked for a little while longer, then all five of us left. We took a quick detour to a local park for lunch. We decided to go back there for some alone time. We headed to a remote park where we had a picnic. Kayla made another salad while Mike and I had our burgers. She didn't get back to our room as Mike and I went toward the kitchen together.</p> <p>"What if dad comes by?" Mike asked. "Are you guys done or what?"</p> <p>Kayla looked at me first and then at Mike. "No," she said. "I think we're really done, with our little adventures." Mike looked at Kayla and kissed her. He was looking into her eyes when he pulled away. "You really enjoyed it, didn't you?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes, I did. I can't wait to do it again," she answered.</p> <p>Just then, mom and Josh walked toward us. The kids were taking a dip in the lake and I heard a little splash as mom sat down on a rock. "Hi, Dad," Kayla said. "How are you?"</p> <p>"Dad! I've been looking forward to going in and out of water. Have you seen your old truck?"</p> <p>"No, he's already had it done and is about to start it in the next few days."</p> <p>"That's awesome!" I said. "Why don't we go to my truck and do some shopping together?"</p> <p>"That's a great idea," Mom said, smiling. "I've already had the truck and am having fun. I love the feel of his big cock in my pussy." She laughed. "How about it, Dad? What do you think? You won't be alone for a few days, so we'll keep an eye on you."</p> <p>"I think Dad's been looking forward to this for days." It was then that we heard the door open and there was Kayla and Mike, talking.</p> <p>"Hey, guys!" Kayla greeted them as they entered the room. Mike and I turned toward her. "Mom, we're glad you decided to come along," I said. "How would you like to spend a day with Kayla with us?"</p> <p>"Oh, Mike?" Kayla said, taking his hand. "She looks really nice."</p> <p>"Kayla's the beautiful one. You should be getting to know her even better," Mikes brother said. "After all, Dad hasn't seen one of you at college."</p> <p>Mike looked Kayla up and down and then smiled. "Yeah," he said. "I'll bet Kayla is looking mighty hot with that young stud!" Then he added, "Why don't you go see what Kayla and you can do. Dad and I'll meet you two in the bedroom."</p> <p>Mom laughed at his comment and then said, "Mike, I'd really like you and Mike to spend a day together, but I just can't."</p> <p>"Really?" Mike said. "Why not, Kayla, you're an amazing young lady." He kissed her on the cheek.</p> <p>As we looked at them in the door of our bedroom, we heard Mom say, "Hey, Dad! What are you two up to?"</p> <p>Mike replied, "Just kidding, honey," then added, "Oh, we haven't even seen your son."</p> <p>Kayla and I broke into giggles and went back into the bedroom, closing the door behind us.</p> <p>"Are you OK with us spending a day together?" Kayla asked.</p> <p>"Of course not. What can I say?
