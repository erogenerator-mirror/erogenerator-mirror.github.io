You can call me Cindy. What is yours? You can't just go looking for me. Call me Cindy."</p> <p>"Well Cindy, I do not like to keep up appearances."</p> <p>"If you want to make a game of this then you might want to talk to me a little more about this game of yours. I'll tell you that you can come back for a while."</p> <p>"OK, but I'm not sure what game this game is called. I'll tell you, but I don't know the rules of it."</p> <p>"Come on now Cindy, you can show me the rules of the game, but you're not showing it unless you have a clear shot of my cock in those pretty bikini bottoms."</p> <p>"If I show you that I want to show you that I'll tell you I don't like the game. I just have to get my tits covered up."</p> <p>"OK Cindy, show me your tits. Do you want to?"</p> <p>"I guess I do. But if I show you that my tits, and it's no big deal, do we have a deal?"</p> <p>"You're sure?"</p> <p>"Yeah, but you have to promise me that you won't tell any of those other girls that you're naked with my husband, do you have a deal?"</p> <p>"I swear I won't tell anyone. Why is this all so fast?"</p> <p>"It's just that...if I show you that I'm naked with your husband, I have to be naked with him."</p> <p>"Yes, you can see that you have big tits, Cindy."</p> <p>"I guess I can't tell my husband that. But if I can show him my tits."</p> <p>"Cindy that wouldn't go that far."</p> <p>"Maybe I should. I have to be up on the stage right here, if we play again, I'm sure I have a shot."</p> <p>"OK, but I'm not naked and have to get my tits covered up before I do the job."</p> <p>"OK, you're sure you don't want to?"</p> <p>"I guess I can't help it."</p> <p>"I don't want to do it."</p> <p>"I won't let you touch me like that. I'm not going to let you touch me like that either."</p> <p>"Look, I'm sorry. I never should have said anything like that. Please forgive me. I'm sure you can take better care with that big hard thing in those tight fitting bikini bottoms."</p> <p>She just nodded as she picked up her robe off the settee. "I'm sure you'll take better care with mine."</p> <p>We made our excuses after she left the room and she drove back to her place. About five minutes later I heard the back door open and close. She came in the house and took off her robe and laid it on a chair near the door.</p> <p>"It's time for me to lose my bikini. I'm going to show you that my tits aren't too small. Come on and show me those big soft things of yours. Come on."</p> <p>She reached out to me and I took her hand and pulled her over to the settee next to mine. "Come sit down on my lap. I'll show you that I really do like you and that I like holding you and feeling you with my tits. OK?"</p> <p>"OK. But don't forget the rules that I agreed to."</p> <p>"They didn't have to be changed if you won't tell anybody about what you've just done. I would have heard about all those people in that shop in here and wouldn't have been able to do what I did."</p> <p>"Now Cindy, I'm not your husband. I never thought about what we did anyhow and I didn't come close to being nude with your husband. It's just a game if I can't handle it. I'll let you win the next round if you think I can handle it. I don't want to lose my bikini bottoms again. The only thing I'm going to tell your husband is that it was my fault that you got naked in front of all those people in one of the shops. You gave me a great chance to get naked in front of everyone."</p> <p>"OK, you win the next round. I'm not going to have that kind of advantage again."</p> <p>I put my arms around her neck and pulled her down onto my lap. Her breasts were smashed against my chest. She pulled up her bikini top and sat back. I lifted two of her hands and she just looked at me.
