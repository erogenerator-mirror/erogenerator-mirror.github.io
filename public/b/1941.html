"I want in," he murmured. "Are you ready to take this?"</p> <p>She let him take her, and as he held her gently, he lifted her higher off his lap, and she was aware that he was carrying and lifting her. As he lowered her, she looked into his eyes, and once again found the man she loved, and she wondered if she could ever trust him again.</p> <p>And that scared her.</p> <p>She wanted to believe him, and to go with it. She wanted to feel him take her virginity, and to feel the pain and humiliation with her as they went on their date, until her blood did not matter, before being used and used like that as a lover in front of them on a dancefloor, until he was holding, taking, and sharing, and never letting her forget.</p> <p>But her heart wanted to break.</p> <p>"Oh, I've already had," she told him. "All of you."</p> <p>Bryce laughed.</p> <p>"But we don't waste time."</p> <p>"I've had a lot of fun, too," he told her. "Besides, if we had, we'd already had my cock in you the other day, and I would have shot me first."</p> <p>His cock swelled in his pants again, and she was sure he could feel its length, and it was as long as she liked. She closed her eyes, feeling her insides clench, and he was so sexy.</p> <p>"I like you," she said. "I just hope it does for you what I have to have in me, my dear. But I've already let you, and there's no one else. I don't want a repeat." She felt flushed, and her breathing quickened.</p> <p>He kissed the top of her head, then began to move her in his lap, holding himself back, as he raised and lowered her. As she felt his cock, pressing against her ass, and the curve of her hip, it was so exciting and powerful, it excited her every sense of sexual awareness. It excited her, too, until it got inside her, and she realized, in that one movement, that pleasure was her own. The other.</p> <p>She gasped, and Bryce's hands slid out from under her. She felt fingers touch her breasts, then, caressing them, sliding softly, almost as though he were touching them himself. She closed her eyes, and it made her pussy tingle and ache. She felt herself losing control as he did that, and wondered if he had not read her mind. Could she feel himself getting hard, against her ass? Maybe he had, so she was excited about it, too. She felt the hot flesh of his cock press against her, and she gasped again, then opened her eyes and looked at him, her chest heaving, and saw how she had closed her eyes in pleasure. He felt good, and she was not the only one who had touched him this way, she knew, and she hoped he could do it again.</p> <p>And if he did, she hoped she would never forget it, and then she would go crazy with shame and embarrassment.</p> <p>A kiss was called, and she saw herself being taken, and it was wonderful, like nothing she had ever felt before. He was so good, and her pussy squeezed itself around him—so hard—and it was wonderful and it felt so good, too.</p> <p>"Oh, my God," she moaned. "Oh, God, Bryce!" When she felt his arms around her, and her legs in his lap, it was perfect. It felt so good to love him, and it felt so good to feel loved.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," she heard herself say, her voice almost inaudible. "That was wonderful."</p> <p>He laughed, and began to move inside her again. His movements were long, but slow, and his mouth never left hers. And when she closed her eyes again, she could hear the sighs from his lips, hear his ragged breathing as he continued.</p> <p>"I love you," she cried out. "Oh, God, how I love you. What you do and will for me, and what you do for me."</p> <p>"Oh, I love you, too," he replied.</p> <p>She could feel his cock swelling, he was so hot inside her. She felt her clench around him, saw her arms going limp as he held her up, as he lifted her to him, and when he lifted her again, she felt her pussy get wet again, and when he was still inside her, it felt as though she had orgasmed again as she had the first—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
