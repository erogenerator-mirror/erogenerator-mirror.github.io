I replied.</p> <p>I opened my eyes when my brain registered the new sensations, the warm flush of pleasure in my chest as he pressed against the backs of my thighs, the soft, firm grip of his hand as he slid up and down in sync with his stroke. His face contorted in a smile as his tongue slipped between the soft, wet lips of my sex as he sucked. One eye on the screen, and his hand on my thigh. I closed my eyes and tried to think again, but it was a futile effort. My breath was coming in short gasps and I could feel that tingle building, I felt the start of an orgasm building, I struggled to fight it, fought to hold back the sensations, but with every passing second my head went from cloud to cloud, my pussy growing wetter and wetter and I was getting excited again.</p> <p>He stopped stroking, and the soft pressure of his finger in my wetness was like a shocker to my nerves.</p> <p>"Mmmmm..." I felt relieved. I took a huge breath and closed my eyes again as I struggled to hold back the waves of pleasure. I needed it, I needed it more than ever. He stopped, and his body went slack as his hand slid off my thigh to rest in one arm. With trembling fingers he drew me to him and kissed me and slowly drew me down into his warm arms until the warm breath of his mouth closed over mine, his tongue sliding against my lips, and I parted them to accept him. I tasted so good, it was almost as if I were melting into him. I felt him moving, his body tightening to me as his cock slid between us, sliding against me as he pressed my lower body back against the cold sheet. We were both breathing raggedly, and my eyes snapped open as I looked at him and I felt completely, hopelessly lost in my lust.</p> <p>He slid his hand across my cheek and I looked into his eyes, it was almost as if we had been one. The feeling was so real, it wasn't an animal in need, but it was hard to feel with you, or with anything, but I could feel it with him, and it was something I had never felt with my ex; a feeling for him, a longing, something strange, and somehow he had found another way to pleasure me. He began to press back, and I felt myself begin to push back against him, and I was so wet that I could slide down his cock with ease, and his eyes met mine and I felt myself pushing again, feeling his cock slide against my wetness, and I felt a new ache rise in me, and then the soft warmness of his lips.</p> <p>He felt the pressure of my stomach as my body lifted up his cock, and I felt a new feeling - one of vulnerability and, well, I might add, arousal. As he continued to slide against me, I felt his hardness, and I felt that there, so close, so far... I felt it as a feeling in me, not unlike the kind you feel for someone that has just been with a man, a sexual partner, a lover, a stranger that doesn't feel the emotions that they normally do, but I felt something, and I could feel it... as I felt his mouth against my sex once again, I felt it as he gently pressed another finger back into my body, and I felt another, but this one was different. I felt an orgasm building in me, and my hands reached out to press him back to me, I held him as my hand moved down between us, I felt the warmth of his body as he pressed back into me, and he felt like he was filling me whole. He kissed me a moment later, and I felt it as my body rose up his cock again, and I found myself pushing back against him.</p> <p>He felt my body arch up like a cat, and he knew I was close, and he knew I was going to have another orgasm. I felt another orgasm building deep inside of me. Our bodies were moving so fast against one another, and they had the same effect as before, our flesh and bones seemed so connected even when we were in public. I knew I wouldn't last long. I could feel my orgasm approaching.</p> <p>"Wait, please, it's too late."</p> <p>I was still in his arms after my last orgasm, so I didn't stop him, I felt his fingers slide to my pussy, and I felt him begin slipping over me, slowly. That one feeling, his fingers sliding back inside me, over my clit, and down into my pussy once more. I felt a second orgasm building within me, this first from watching him and feeling it as I felt him, that feeling as I touched him and felt his body against me, as he wanted to press into me and feel his cock inside me.</p> <p>He slid hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
