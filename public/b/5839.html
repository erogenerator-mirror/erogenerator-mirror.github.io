He tasted salty and hard. One of his hands went down between my thighs to rub my wet crotch. I was so wet that he slid his finger inside me a fraction of an inch. He groaned and pulled away. I wanted to get the finger inside but I was too embarrassed to put my lips together and did not let loose of the kiss.</p> <p>"I can't believe how fucking wet I am," he said.</p> <p>"Neither can I," I said.</p> <p>"God, you are beautiful," he said. He held me a little tighter. We pulled the shower curtain back so it did not run in front of the other.</p> <p>"Can we do this some other time?" I said.</p> <p>"I want to try," he said. He lifted his hand away and began sliding his finger back and forth inside me again. He was in such a position, I couldn't stop him. The room fell silent and the water hit my legs. He started with two fingers inside me in a few different spots. I could not help it. His thumb found my clit and teased it lightly.</p> <p>"Fuck," I cried.</p> <p>I began humping my hips up as he stroked my pussy to orgasm. I kept coming and came again and again as he kept his thumb on my clit. By now I was trembling. I just knew that I was going to come again.</p> <p>"I'm still waiting," I said.</p> <p>Slowly, I got up, turned around and wrapped my arms around his neck. My breasts rested against his chest and my thighs closed over him. I kissed him and stroked his cock with my feet. I wanted him inside me. I just wanted him to stick it in me. I could feel his hardon against my belly and I could tell that he was leaking a little. I wanted to taste him. I wanted to have him blow on my tongue. I wanted to fuck his brains out but I also wanted him to cum on my face.</p> <p>"Where do we go from here?" he said.</p> <p>"I'm not sure," I said. "I do not want to get married."</p> <p>He reached down taking my hand and turning me back to face the mirror. "If I ever decide to take that risk," he said. "If you ever decide you do not want to do that."</p> <p>"I do not want to wait," I said softly. We laughed. "I want to feel you inside me." He moved to kiss me again. This time, both mouths were open and his tongue touched mine. His hands moved from my hips to my breasts and then to my ass and then back to my thighs. He pulled me to him and my thighs fell open as his tongue entered my mouth. I gasped when his hand slid up my stomach and found my hardon. I was in ecstasy.</p> <p>My kisses returned to our mouths and I felt him slide off the bed. He went back to the shower curtain and said quietly, "I'll stop if we don't have to go again."</p> <p>I stood and took off the bathrobe he was still wearing. I was nude. He returned the bathrobe to it's covering, as he had told me to do. When I was ready to get dressed, I pulled him into the shower with me and kissed him. He started feeling my ass and pulled at the elastic at the top of my legs that I had worn the previous week. He pulled me to him, turned me around so he could kiss me, sucked on my tits and played with my wet pussy with his fingers that were still in my cunt. I was in absolute bliss.</p> <p>I felt him between my legs and his head was between my legs. I was ready for him. I was soaking wet as he pushed his tongue inside me. I groaned as his tongue began sliding in and out of my wet hole. He could hear how wet I was and he was licking and sucking at my clit. I was moaning and writhing under him. He kept his mouth on me and moved his tongue around the sensitive nerve that made me feel so good. I had a hard time breathing. I thought I was going to faint. It was all felt so good. I had been so used, but he was loving. He continued to eat me out while he rubbed my ass. By now it was all that mattered. I wanted, needed, his cock inside. I was ready. I needed to be fucked. I had never wanted it so much or anything as I wanted his cock in me and I wanted it to last and to fuck me.</p> <p>"I'm gonna come," I cried.</p> <p>I felt him stop licking me and his hand went back to my pussy and found my clit and rubbed it.
