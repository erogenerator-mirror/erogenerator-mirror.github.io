She said.</p> <p>"My cock. Fuck that, fuck it." I said, as I pulled back and slipped myself back in. I started to stroke myself in and out, going in and out as much as the strap-on was moving, not really being as deep as the cock I had fucked earlier. She was really giving me deep strokes as I pulled back, my head looking straight back.</p> <p>"Yeah...that's better," she said. "I'm glad we got rid of our condoms. Now get into the bed. You can come in when you're ready. You are so fucking nasty. Come on and fuck me, I really need it! And I don't want to be alone!" I smiled and started backing away so she could get onto the bed on her back. As I walked away, her hand shot to the strap-on and held herself up so it was almost touching her face. "Are you ready to make out in front of me?" She asked. I didn't want to, but I couldn't resist. I moved over to her, laying my dick against the strap-on, it coming to a rest against her cheek as I laid back down. She looked it over, watching and smiling as she reached out to hold it. It was actually a little longer and thicker than the strap-on she had come in, it had the feel of a real cock as she felt it. "Mmmm, just perfect. So fucking nice, I wish you'd let me do this some more." She laughed, I mean, maybe I really am a guy.</p> <p>I grinned. "Really? That would be awesome."</p> <p>"That's all I could think about right now. I needed that." She gave it a little squeeze and smiled a wicked smile. "I wonder what it would feel like if you did this to me."</p> <p>"That'd be nice, but it'd be like being in a porn movie." I joked.</p> <p>"So. I thought it might make it more intense." She said, her breasts heaving beneath me.</p> <p>"Maybe." I said, running my hands along her arms and around her back and over her ass again. Her nipples didn't seem to be getting hard, but they were stiffening as I ran them through them and then down the sides of her body. "So. You and I both know what we just did is ok?"</p> <p>She didn't seem to hear me. "It was awesome, right?" I leaned in for another kiss on her lips, I was really enjoying this.</p> <p>"Yeah, great. But it's not just to make you cum. It's because we both know that's exactly why we did this! You know, 'cause I want you to keep fucking me until the whole neighborhood hears." She gave me one of those beautiful smiles.</p> <p>"You like to say things like that." I whispered in her ear.</p> <p>"That makes me happy. You are a super cock-sucking whore, I really like it." I ran my hands up the backs of her thighs, and slipped my hands under her ass. Her leg fell back and opened, and I pushed my hips back to her, sinking back into her. I was getting close.</p> <p>"Fuck me, baby, put that hot cock in me." She said. Her breathing was getting faster, and if I looked forward, she was stroking my cock.</p> <p>"You want to do this again, babe?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes." She almost shouted, her face turning red.</p> <p>"Well, I love you and I want to keep doing this." I whispered, holding myself back as far as I could. She got another of those smiles I love. I knew I would enjoy doing what she said, but I was kind of worried about what she would say next. I also thought about what she might expect next. I wasn't sure if she liked anal, as opposed to vaginal sex, or did I really want to eat her ass, but what did that matter?</p> <p>Her hands began to rub herself faster. She moved her hips closer to me, and put more pressure on my hand against her clit. "Let's try something different. Lay down on the bed with your feet up." She said, and got on her back, her head at the head of the bed. Her legs were splayed wide apart, showing me even deeper inside her, her eyes closed as she enjoyed herself. My fingers found their way under her breasts, down the front, across her belly to find her clit. Her eyes never opened for a second. She looked so hot. I think it wasn't a one-time thing, you know, for me to want her. She was so aroused. I love it. I can't wait to do thisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
