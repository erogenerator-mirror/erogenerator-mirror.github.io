I kept my head down. "Just fucking forget it," I replied. "I didn't mean to startle you."</p> <p>She let out a loud guffaw. I looked over at the phone she still held in her left forearm. My hands were still behind me and I felt a hand press against my back. I turned to look up at her. Her eyes were so bright I was sure she would be seeing a color film. I could only hope it wasn't from the tears streaming down her face, or my eyesight.</p> <p>"Please. Just let me talk," she pleaded, "Please."</p> <p>"No," I snapped, "I still have about an hour. I have you and you alone for an hour. I don't know what you are capable of, but I will do better than what you tried."</p> <p>"You are just too stupid to be telling my father that I'll help you," she said, "I'm not really sure I'm still a child."</p> <p>"You need me to help you," I lied. "You need somebody to talk to."</p> <p>"I didn't mean to sound like this," she replied with tear filled eyes.</p> <p>"Yes, and it was nice talking to you. But what's the harm in a little talk? That's all I needed to do," I stated.</p> <p>"What do you have in mind for tomorrow?" she asked?</p> <p>"I want to make something special for you," I suggested, hoping her father would understand.</p> <p>"Well, maybe I can convince you then. If it is what you really want, I can talk to you about that."</p> <p>My cock ached with desire for her, but it was a fleeting thought. I knew she would do anything to please me. Of course, she never really went out after dark. It was a new twist on our lives. In a few hours, I was alone with my fantasy woman and the thought would come true.</p> <p>"I need to talk to you, though, Mr. James," I said, "But we have time."</p> <p>"Please. I'm willing to listen," she replied.</p> <p>"I'm willing to hear anything you want. But, I need some alone time."</p> <p>"Alright, Mr. James," she said, "Give me half an hour."</p> <p>"Okay," I said, "I'll be waiting."</p> <p>She hung up and I watched her feet go to the door. I watched her step to the door and the soft footsteps of her heels. I turned and opened the door, and there she stood, watching me, for the longest time.</p> <p>"Mr. James?" she asked, "What are you doing?"</p> <p>"Would you like me to lock you in your room?" I asked, "I'm in no state to answer right now." I stepped into the room and closed the door.</p> <p>"Well I'm going to be alone." She said, "But, could you please lock, lock, lock the door? I'd like to know how you found me, and I need to know why."</p> <p>I looked for a moment, but found the lock and turned on the door. The lock clicked soundlessly. I stepped to the wall, where the door was. I walked around the room, looking at some pictures of people, and then down to the living room.</p> <p>"Come and stand next to the phone on the bed," I said, "I'll open up the phone and you can talk to me about anything you want."</p> <p>"Now," she said, "We can talk a little longer, but, we can't use the phone."</p> <p>"We can do that, just let me shut the door and lock it," I said, "It wouldn't do for us to get into such a state, right?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes," she said happily, "We can do it, I just need to understand how it is, and it's what she wanted before."</p> <p>"We can do that?" I asked, "You've never done the other room before?"</p> <p>"No," she replied, "Please, please, don't ask. Just lock that door, please?"</p> <p>This was all my girl. Of course, my girl wanted to talk to me, but I was her father and she was eighteen. I had to be her father, and that wasn't going to be a problem for much longer. So I went to locking the door, then looking up into her face to see if she was listening to me. I got the door open then turned her around and started to unbutton her shirt.</p> <p>"What are you doing," she asked, "There's been no talk about thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
