"My little darling."</p> <p>Smiling from ear to ear I nodded and kissed her deeply. Her tongue probing me as I lay back and enjoyed her embrace, she pressed into me and her pussy was so wet it slipped in my leg and was now on fire for release. Her arms going round me to pull the robe off me as her breathing quickened. I felt like a helpless puppet who was on the point of exploding and begging for release.</p> <p>Her body was so beautifully slim except that her breasts stood firm and proud under her bra.</p> <p>"It's so beautiful, sweetheart" she said as my thumb played with the hard pink pinkness. She was so wet that when my fingers slid down and into her I slipped my finger in as far as it would go.</p> <p>"Oh yessss." she sighed with each thrust that my finger made as well as in response to her own deep pleasure. It was her sex that she was giving herself to so fully, her legs wrapping the arms of my chair so hard together they left me no choice but to hold on, hold on tightly as her moans grew louder and louder and I felt her thighs tremble and then spasm around my finger even more. Her breath rasped out as she became limp beneath me and she had a look down at me, watching her breasts rise and fall.</p> <p>Holding her close I said, "I love you so much."</p> <p>"I know, honey" she replied "please don't stop."</p> <p>She sat up slightly and kissed me again. "I've missed you." she said. "Now we can do something together."</p> <p>She lay on top me and we kissed deeply as our hands explored each other's body. It was the first time I had touched a girl and I almost felt guilty for my inexperience, but I kept my mind on the pleasures of the softness of her skin and her softness I had felt in my arms before, and the way she held herself against my chest.</p> <p>"Mmm...." she sighed as she continued to caress me there and she pulled away "now what?" she asked suddenly as my fingers continued to move against her pussy.</p> <p>I smiled a little and told her that I'd always wanted to feel myself, and she was the perfect girl for me. She looked into my eyes as she put her hand behind my head and kissed me deeply. I could see the love in her eyes and felt myself responding in kind to her advances as well.</p> <p>She pushed me back on to the sofa as she pulled her robe off her shoulders and off as it fell to the floor. The light from the window illuminated her skin and I knew that she loved it. This time she held out her arms and I lay back and enjoyed the sensation of her soft curves against me, the warmth of her skin on mine. I enjoyed every second of her touch, every moment of contact between us.</p> <p>Her kisses were more passionate now as her fingers started to stroke my shaft as she lay down on me. Her soft lips pressing against mine, her tongue running along my lips, her breasts on my stomach.</p> <p>As her tongue danced with mine she lay down with me for the first time ever and we embraced. Our bodies were so close that I could feel her breasts on mine and I could feel her breath on my face as she kissed me. I could feel both of us responding to the moment as her hips rose, her juices coating my shaft as she moved higher on me.</p> <p>I felt the muscles of her vagina rubbing against my tip as her lips parted and her juices slid out onto the lips of my cock. With her hands sliding down my chest I felt her pull on her nipples which seemed to drive her wild as she leaned over me and licked her juice off with her tongue. Her hands never stopped massaging me, the skin was so soft as her hands slid down my stomach, over my cock and she stroked it over my foreskin, making me shudder as she went even wetter against my tip and the shaft.</p> <p>I moaned at the touch of her and she said "Michael, I want to make love with you" and we kissed, our tongues dancing passionately as if we felt a mutual passion. My body responded to her touch by sliding to the edge of the sofa and I lay on my back as our bodies were pressed against each others and we could feel the warmth and the passion of our bodies.</p> <p>I looked down at her and she pulled her hair, letting the hair fall down to her shoulders, her skin so light and soft, the hair framing her beautiful face and the look of her face, as the hairâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
