"Are you following me?"</p> <p>"Yep."</p> <p>"And what is my route if I'm not following."</p> <p>He shrugged and headed over to her truck.</p> <p>"It's not going to be a long drive, is it?"</p> <p>"Nah."</p> <p>"What if we do this and I have to come over here?"</p> <p>"I don't think that's a good idea."</p> <p>"Alright, I'm coming with you."</p> <p>"And where do we go from here?"</p> <p>"Well, it's not exactly a long journey to see civilization."</p> <p>"It will take a while, and I could go into town to pick up a few supplies."</p> <p>"No, no, I'm coming too."</p> <p>"But that's not what I meant."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Please."</p> <p>"No, I mean, that might help you more than that. I'm trying to take you through towns. And I feel like we're going to stop there every now and then."</p> <p>"You're just trying to keep me from going straight to your place to get a couple of food and some good sleep before we decide whether we're going to find a decent job or not."</p> <p>"That's an understatement."</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>As he drove off down the road they kept talking about the things they'd seen in that little video. It was not until they pulled into a little gravel driveway were they finally saw what all the talking and talking had gotten to about. It was a very long walk through town towards a huge store with people coming out everywhere. They walked the entire way around and sat on what looked like a large circular bench at the edge of the porch. It only covered half of it, just one table. He sat down in it and was told to remove his shoes when an older man came in.</p> <p>"What do you think we're looking for, if it looks like it's going anywhere like this?"</p> <p>"I don't know and that's why I came up here."</p> <p>"Don't be shy with me."</p> <p>"I am not."</p> <p>The older man nodded. He had a white and gold chain chain bracelet on. He looked around at the stores.</p> <p>"How come you two never came out there before?"</p> <p>"We don't have money, we just do. That's why we came here."</p> <p>"Is there something else that goes along on the end?"</p> <p>The older man looked and said. "I got to ask. Why don't you guys come with me and I'll show you around. You'll have to do some shopping, if you really want to."</p> <p>"I'll go with you, and thanks."</p> <p>"There's nothing to it..." the older man said just before he saw the young couple enter the store. It was a little on the far side of the store they wanted to enter first. Before they sat down, he said. "...but I don't think I want to see you."</p> <p>The young man looked down at him and said. "I know. But it's only a few dollars."</p> <p>He turned back to the young couple. "Well, do you want me to come with you or not?"</p> <p>The young man shook his head and stood up.</p> <p>"Let's go."</p> <p>The young couple followed him as he lead them past a large window. He stepped out onto the street and led them down a long driveway and around another large door.</p> <p>"Let's drive down here and pick out some clothes. Just keep your shoes on."</p> <p>He turned and looked back and said. "I'll be right back." He walked down towards more buildings and said. "If you come back we can look at something else then... "</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>When she saw him she just smiled and said. "Don't worry about it."</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>She was so glad to walk around in the daylight that she found it difficult to tell if she was walking around naked or if she was just sitting there in her own little world. He was going to turn around so she could say she was just there, and she didn't have to yell very loud when she did. It seemed like she had no choice in the matter. So, she just sat down when he came out of the house. She sat as close to him as she could. She could feel her chest rising and falling slightly as if she were trying to hide it from himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
