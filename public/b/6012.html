"I think it's not fair of me. I have a job and I can't help it."</p> <p>"It wasn't you?" I asked, genuinely surprised.</p> <p>He paused, then let it happen. This was going to be a test. I was going to try and stop him. He hadn't even left the club. I thought for the hundredth time then that the game was over. He was going to have to deal with it for now. So I was left alone.</p> <p>He turned and turned and said, "Well, I guess you've done it already. You just left the club with your friends! What's the big deal with that?"</p> <p>"No big deal." He continued to hold onto my arm and wave me off. "You're safe with me." We exited the club and I walked him to his car.</p> <p>He pulled me over to a local park and I sat there. I was in awe that he kept to his word. His face was just that...impassive.</p> <p>"The little slut here is going to learn a few things," he said smiling at me. "She will probably use her mouth...her pretty little tongue as well." He grabbed the hem of my shorts and pulled them and my panties the rest of the way down. He got down between my legs. He lifted them up over my panties and looked at my dripping pussy, then looked up at me.</p> <p>"I have been thinking about this the longest; you know what I mean?" He asked. "I'm going to use that on you now, so that you'll know it's you that has to be punished"</p> <p>I was completely out of it. I had no idea that he would do this. My legs were trembling and I pulled my knees together. I was in no position to beg. I would just tell him, without a sound. I was totally defeated. His eyes were smiling, so I opened them again and looked him in the eyes. They said that something was up with him.</p> <p>He was still holding my panties to my mouth.</p> <p>"Get it clean, slut!" he yelled and grabbed my hips. He began to pull them to the side of my pussy and my vagina. When the panties were wet with juices I thought it would just go on. His fingers began to press between my swollen lips. They parted them a little and his finger slid into me. It touched places not touched before and I felt myself shudder.</p> <p>It felt so fucking wonderful. I was surprised that I was still in my own house. The thought that I was going to be caught in the act was such a turn-on.</p> <p>He began to move his cock in and out of me. He kept pressing in and it was wonderful. He had a hold of my hips as he began to slam his hips against me. It was clear that he knew what to do. He was doing everything that he thought he was going to do. The thought that this was wrong wasn't anything that I wanted to think about. I just laid there helplessly. Suddenly, with one thrust, he slid himself in to the balls of his feet and held me there. He pulled himself out and drove it back in...hard...I'm sure. The feeling was almost indescribable.</p> <p>"Fuck me, you cock-hungry whore! Use me! Fuck that feels good." He had his head thrown back as he felt his orgasm coming on. It didn't take him long; it was only another second or so before he was on the verge of shooting into my pussy. The feeling of power and power. He just kept pumping away and I felt his cum splash against the walls of my cunt. I don't know how much longer I could hold it back. He started to pull himself out and I was so grateful that he had pulled out. The feeling of it all flowing out of me filled my head with a sense of completion. His cum was dripping out of me onto my thighs and ass. It was the last straw. He leaned back and we were both done to exhausted. I put myself to the floor and lay there as he turned the lights off and locked us in our bedroom. Before we knew it we were naked on our backs on his bed. He was on all fours, his cock up in the air, fucking me. I couldn't do anything but stare for a while. That was the last thing anybody could do. They were both naked. Then he lay on his stomach, pulled himself up to a sitting position.</p> <p>"Fuck me!" he yelled. "Fuck that slut. You're mine." He grabbed his cock at the base and pointed it at my entrance. He pushed again, sliding himself through me.
