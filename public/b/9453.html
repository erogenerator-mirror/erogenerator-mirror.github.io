He wanted me to be a physician to treat his wife when she came here. When we got her home from work there was nothing left for me but to take care of her. It's been three years now, and, besides, she's been cheating on you for years. I'm sorry."</p> <p>"Are you going to tell your wife that you're a doctor?"</p> <p>"I'm not sure, but it's all over with now."</p> <p>"What have you been doing?"</p> <p>"I just started to come home late from work."</p> <p>"You've been doing that too, haven't you? I thought there was something about me bothering you. Maybe it was something else."</p> <p>"No! No, not at all."</p> <p>"Why haven't you told me?"</p> <p>"I was thinking about it and I just don't understand why we can't go back to being a normal family. I'm sorry but, it's still over with, and we can't change that either!"</p> <p>"I don't blame you," she said. "We'll go back to being what we were," and she paused and looked at me with sad eyes. "We'll try to make this work."</p> <p>And I did. We moved into the master bedroom, as far as I'd ever been, until it got to being, well, that.</p> <p>"My bedroom? Do I need the key at the keypad?"</p> <p>"No! You and I both know where it is."</p> <p>I didn't need the keypad, just the keys to unlock the door and I heard the lock snap open, followed by a slight thump and the door closed behind us.</p> <p>She said the same as her husband when I'd been married, "And you can forget the whole thing."</p> <p>"If your husband didn't like what he heard, it doesn't matter," I retorted.</p> <p>"I've known it would all along, so you'll hear it, or you can pretend that nothing had happened."</p> <p>"I've already heard something, but I've missed you so much and I'm in an anxious mood."</p> <p>"It's been five years, and you've come to me with the key, so get rid of it and wait and see."</p> <p>"But you're my daddy, I'm not your wife!"</p> <p>"I don't think I can do that, it's in my genes for me to have you in my life."</p> <p>I started to protest, but she had already started to unbutton my shirt, which had become my favorite article of clothing for the trip home from my wife's cheating. By the time they got down to business, I was only a little shy. I was now fully dressed.</p> <p>"I don't know what to do. I can't take you back to your old ways," she said.</p> <p>"But you're my daddy," I replied.</p> <p>"I'm not, but I can go back to being my old ways if it means staying in your house."</p> <p>"It means staying with you," I agreed. "Can we stay here for a while, please?"</p> <p>"I'll take that as a yes then,"</p> <p>"Thank you, so much," I told her.</p> <p>"No," she said and hugged me, holding me for a long time. "I have to go back."</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"We'd be too far back for me to walk back to your house," I said. "I'll walk."</p> <p>"We could do that," she suggested. "We'd do that again."</p> <p>"I'm okay," I replied sadly, and we walked to my car. "I don't want to be alone," I said.</p> <p>I drove over to her house and started to knock on the door when I heard the sound of something wet. She opened the door and looked at me as I stepped into the house. I wasn't surprised, and was actually disappointed. She looked at me, her eyes moist and blue, and said, "Take me home; I need to pee then."</p> <p>We walked slowly and I felt her hand on my arm as we passed my car.</p> <p>"No," I said. "You take me home, take me home now."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sorry," she said. "I had to pee after, and while you're in the living room I'll join you.
