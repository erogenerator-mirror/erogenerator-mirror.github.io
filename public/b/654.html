What was I thinking! This seemed like the perfect opportunity as I thought of the possibilities. I started with her name, telling her she should call me Tony. As I did this, I got to thinking, this might not be the last time I met her! For sure, it would be fun to meet her! I had already seen her and liked her very much, but I had never fantasized about having "sex" with the lovely Amanda! Even though my fantasy was more than just sex for me, the thought itself was very taboo! I could never dream of letting another woman in the house that I did not love! And that was just the beginning of my career!</p> <p>And that is how I met Amanda. I met Amanda after a friend of mine recommended me to the company. I had been working in a computer office, so when I heard that they were having a party, I took an afternoon off to visit. I did have to ask her out once, and I think I've been falling for her for ages! I tried to get to know her a little better the first couple days, but to no avail. We were still friends, and she seemed very friendly as the days went by. We still worked as colleagues, but we kept seeing each other in the office. It was nice to be able to enjoy company, especially one as intelligent as Amanda!</p> <p>I did notice once that her breasts did not fit her blouse very well. I was shocked and a little flattered. I guess the "tit" thing was not the place to meet and get a girlfriend but just to be polite. Amanda and I were friendly, but just in a different way. I don't think she'd ever really admit to the thought of me having sex with her. But she did get up on time to talk to me, which was a nice start to the day. I could feel myself becoming more and more comfortable, although it was never about her, just me and her.</p> <p>We were having lunch over this last thing, when she asked me if I would consider buying her a drink. This was a pleasant surprise as it would be nice to have a little fun. I smiled as I said yes, to which she replied that her glass of wine might also be useful. We agreed to meet up again, and walked out the door together. When we got to Amanda's house, Amanda came out of her house and into our garage. I followed her and we sat in the car chatting with some of the people we had seen outside the garage today. It was a very nice atmosphere, even though the evening had been rather busy.</p> <p>As we drove we continued to keep catching eye contact. Amanda asked how I knew that, but I just told her about my research and I'd been given a chance and was able to actually do it. We both laughed at my response at the moment. My mind was focused right on Amanda's breasts, which I kept to myself for fear of embarrassing myself. It might have been difficult to hide my fascination, but I was trying not to let my arousal win out over my excitement!</p> <p>Amanda looked so desirable standing there wearing a yellow blouse that displayed her generous breasts. I could just make out her nipples clearly through her blouse. The cleavage of her breasts appeared and disappeared in a deep cleavage! It took all my self control not to touch her nipples. But somehow a little more thought was needed to achieve that.</p> <p>The rest of that evening was very interesting. I was really very much intrigued by this girl I had just met. I felt like having sex with her, but not like just getting a girl friend. She seemed much more to me than I had thought possible for a girl of her age. This was not to say that my own daughter has never made a move on me, but I was beginning to wonder how much of my life it meant for Amanda. I also realized that I would never be a normal male without knowing what it was like for me.</p> <p>The next day, we finished our business at about 10:00, and I went to my home office. Amanda was still trying to calm her nerves, but her mind was clearly on my breasts! She was obviously turned on by the thought and I could tell by her reaction that her mind was on "her own".</p> <p>As I passed by my office, I wondered if she could feel my nipple under her blouse. She didn't seem to notice it, but I suspected that she might if she reached down and touched it.</p> <p>As I walked by her office to go home, Amanda made a move on me. "Tony." She said softly. I looked at her, and said "hi". I don't know what she thought about the "attention".
