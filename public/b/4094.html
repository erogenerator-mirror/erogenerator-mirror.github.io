I know I've started to look a little less than normal. My tits are not a fault to him. My nipples are large, just slightly darker and quite large. The last semester's "Honeydoll" (that always refers to the girls with boobs this size) had a really big rack and I kept the chest she normally wore around the house as far as the boob job kept her happy.</p> <p>He likes wearing those, mostly for my benefit.</p> <p>The rest of the afternoon was my first full day off, which meant more time for the gym. I'm not a huge fan of weights, since at the end of each day off I use a small gym bag.</p> <p>He was sitting on the couch and he looked a little uncomfortable. I had been staring at him in the mirror for a while now, so I gave him a little smile. He blushed, which set me off.</p> <p>"I have to use the bathroom."</p> <p>He was probably thinking I'd go in that direction, but I still made it. I heard the bathroom door open and shut, probably so I wouldn't hear the toilet flush. I thought he'd go out and go to the gym, maybe go back and study on his laptop, but he wasn't in it.</p> <p>I peeked out through the partially opened door, looking through the mirror to make sure he was still in there and decided to play along. I grabbed the towel from my desk and wiped my face. After rinsing it off in the sink I wiped my legs and cleaned off my legs. My ass was a good sight, I suppose because I had gotten a little sore last month. I could just imagine what he would like next.</p> <p>He came out of the bathroom and looked down at me a moment when I opened the bathroom door. He reached down and patted me on the shoulder after standing up.</p> <p>"Are you feeling better?" I asked.</p> <p>He looked down sheepishly at his hard-on. "Yeah. Sorry. I guess the weight thing has gotten a little ... messy."</p> <p>A funny look had crossed his face as he stood there, not at all sure if I knew what I was looking for. I decided to test the waters.</p> <p>"How am I supposed to use the bathroom? Is this something you have to do every day?"</p> <p>He looked a little embarrassed. "I suppose I guess so. I just really need to use the restroom."</p> <p>He looked at me as I walked away then back down the hall. He went back to the mirror until I heard the toilet flush. It was the first time he'd ever made eye contact with me and I was sure he was imagining something. After I left the door open a few seconds later I turned to check my watch. Time is of the essence, I thought, as I looked at myself in the mirror. For every second I was standing there he'd be standing next to me in the bathroom, staring at me.</p> <p>I had just started to look at myself when I realized I wasn't wearing anything. After a few more seconds I turned into the bathroom and stopped. Before I could sit down on the toilet I felt, for the first time, my pussy lips. It felt so warm and soft, wet and inviting. It was almost as large as Steve's cock. They were so soft. I let my hand drop to my lap and slowly let them roam inside me. I started rubbing my pussy all over my fingers, moving all the way through until my middle finger had made contact with my clit. Slowly I inserted it into me until it was completely in. It felt as big as Steve's, so hard and rubbery. I leaned forward as far as I could, opening my legs more so I could rub myself up and down on my throbbing clit and rub it around with my finger.</p> <p>Even though I'd known guys at school had been able to get hard under their pants, this was different and it felt so good. I spread my legs further apart and pulled them back towards them while I continued rubbing, slowly moving back and forth. The pleasure was incredible and I started thrusting my hips to meet my fingers faster and faster.</p> <p>Within minutes I was bucking up and down on the toilet seat so hard I nearly came there and then. At the same time my entire body went rigid, as my orgasm hit me. The flush of my stomach made the whole room spin, and then all light went out of my eyes as the intense pleasure and the sensation of orgasm were so intense. I felt spasming muscles move all along my leg and my body shivered as each wave passed through me. I continued thrusting at that point for a minute or so, and thenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
