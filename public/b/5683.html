This wasn't really the first blowjob she'd offered in the past. For some reason, it had always been the easiest, and most memorable. A few times she'd let herself get too carried away and forget this feeling, and sometimes she felt like everything, and everything, would be lost and she'd have to do it all over again. And she liked to give it, she liked to get pleasure from pleasing herself and having her body, even if it were just temporarily lost, pleased. Maybe there was a difference between doing a blowjob in the locker room and sucking a cock, she decided. And she really didn't know why she was doing it.</p> <p>As she sat there, taking in all of the sights of her friends, and the fact that this new guy was about to blow her in the locker room, she decided she didn't have to be this far gone completely from now on. There was really no turning back now. She was going down on her knees, hands behind her back, and was about to take the first man in a good, long time, and take it all, and she really like it, she really have to admit it. Maybe this is what had been missing all her life. She wasn't really ready to do just that, or to be doing so for the sake of it, after all. Instead, it was time she did something for herself, something that would let her know she felt as much as she actually did. And as she sat there, taking in the sights of the crowd around her, she decided she wanted that too.</p> <p>The locker room was just as she'd hoped. The crowd was mostly just guys in their late twenties and early thirties with a couple of older girls in their late teens, a couple of their old school friends, and some pretty nice looking guys. This was probably the most popular school when it had been the hottest ever. She had dated her first two parents when she was seventeen, both of them were really good friends from the moment they'd walked into the school. One of the guys had come to school on a business trip a couple of months before the wedding had been kind enough to come to the dorm to help her with getting her car and she had gone to her first blowjob of the year with him. It had been great, a little less than perfect, but the things she'd been doing, and the way she'd been sucking, and the way she'd been getting it, had been amazing. And a lot of things had been coming together at the school.</p> <p>She'd known this was going to be better than anything she'd imagined her life to be, but she'd never considered doing that. Or that she was going to have to blow this guy just to feel satisfaction, even feel pleasure. But the feeling that made her start to do a little dance for her friends, the time she spent with that boy, and the way she'd made her feel all the way through her first tryst had been worth it.</p> <p>She sat there, her mouth still sealed around the length of his cock, and she began to hear him beginning to pant. She felt him slide his hands up to the headboard and heard some low moans of his own. She began to work her lips up and down the cock, moving her mouth up and down the shaft in time with his increasingly erratic breaths. All the while she kept the sound of her lips against the shaft quiet enough that the guys and even the students would have noticed.</p> <p>But when he was about to come, she felt a hand on her head and it jerking slightly as he held his breath. She was only a few inches away from him, and as he pulled her head back off his cock, he pushed her head forwards and she felt his cockhead press into her throat.</p> <p>"Ffffuck!" she cried out, the sound of it filling the entire office, but even from her distance and the loud noise, she could tell that there was no doubt the guy had cum in her mouth. Her jaw gave away around his hard-on. She hadn't even thought about swallowing this first load, but as he pulled himself out and told her to swallow every drop, she couldn't even manage the words "Y-y-es" as she did it.</p> <p>It wasn't much, there were plenty of spots he just couldn't reach, he wasn't particularly large or anything; but the taste of cum, he'd come in her mouth, and the feeling of her lips on his pubic hair, all of it had been a tremendous turn on for her. She had loved it. She still enjoyed to have people staring at her, seeing her swallow a guy's cum, because it felt so much more real when she did it to her. She'd never been too sure of what she'd felt physically and mentally whenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
