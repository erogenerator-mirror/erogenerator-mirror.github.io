Her words were getting me horny, but I needed it as much as she.</p> <p>She stood up and started to turn and walk towards the door. I said to her, "you are so sexy that I can't wait until tomorrow when I'll have to come back and pick up the rest. " she replied and we hugged and I felt a firmness between her legs, which led to her crotch, which led to a firmness even more. We hugged for a couple of minutes, my mind reeling with the possibilities of how far we would go. She was right, I'd be willing to try out all of her little hidden pleasures in person.</p> <p>She kissed me and I had a thought I had been looking forward to for weeks, especially as I didn't have the energy to go back to the office. I leaned in for a passionate kiss on her lips, our tongues exploring each others mouths and sharing her taste with each other. My hands reached to her ass and squeezed and kneaded it.</p> <p>I pushed her against the door with the sole of my foot and we made out as we stepped closer to the closet. I could feel her tongue and lips on my lips and her body sliding towards mine. My hands continued to caress her ass as we kissed, the slight movement of her breasts and the sway of the sway of her hips causing my own body to tingle, my cock was hard as a rock and aching.</p> <p>Our lips parted and she began to turn slowly around. Her body moved to the front of the closet, and she bent over at the waist. Her ass was so amazing in the black dress with it's hemline and her legs. The dress left her breasts exposed, and I got an immediate hard on as she took a moment to take it all in while she turned.</p> <p>Without looking back she bent over again, her ass still straight up in the air. Her breasts were so magnificent I thought I'd die seeing them. I took a seat on the couch and waited for her. I had never been able to stare at one before, they were beautiful and the soft brown skin seemed to call out to me.</p> <p>Her smile radiated from her teeth, which she wore full on in a line of pearly whites. They glistened in the light. "Is it always like this?" she asked softly as she walked onto the couch.</p> <p>I just gave her sweet smile the same as she did to me. I was now completely caught between lust and a need for this amazing woman in my arms. I wanted everything she had to offer, but I didn't have time to make the first move, she was already naked, so I had control and it had taken me a while to get it.</p> <p>"I'm going to grab a quick shower and come back for a few things. " She turned to leave and stopped, taking me by the hand.</p> <p>I could only stare as she moved toward the sink. This woman was so different than any woman I knew. A little sultrier than a lot of the women I talked with when we were together, she actually seemed to be shy and not as aggressive as some of the other females I had been with, but I saw that she was different too.</p> <p>She had no idea my thoughts about what she was doing with me would turn me on, it turned her on even more. I wanted to tell her to hurry up, but I held the thought in check until she returned. She had a very sexy smile on her face that I could only smile back at. She looked so sexy at this, looking back at me with that sparkle in her eyes.</p> <p>My heart was pounding as I waited to hear what she had in mind for me. I could see that her eyes were still very full, her lips curled ever so slightly into an upward looking frown and as usual when she smiled at me, a frown that started at her hairline but seemed to grow to her eyes, then slowly down to her perfect breasts. They looked so beautiful.</p> <p>I didn't know what to do, so I leaned closer to hear myself say it, "are you sure?"</p> <p>Her smile widened, "Oh yes, I do have something that would turn me on."</p> <p>With that a mischievous idea entered my mind and I slowly got up from the couch and walked up the stairs to her room. It wasn't a big bed, but I guessed it was one as I closed the door and made sure everything was locked.</p> <p>I was about to turn around to go back up there when I stopped. "Oh, is that what you wanted for me?" I whispered.</p> <p>She took a step closer to me, her eyes still wide. I could see the hint of a smile on her lips when she saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
