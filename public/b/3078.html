Maybe we can go dancing. If not...well, I'll see you tomorrow. We'll see when we get back home."</p> <p>"Yeah. Okay baby. Bye."</p> <p>She closed the door and put on her shirt. She ran through the house and headed toward the car. After pulling out of the driveway, she headed downtown and grabbed a few things to go. She was feeling as bored as she had when she was a teenager.</p> <p>After buying a few drinks, she walked up a few escalators to the top of the hotel. She was surprised when she got to the room. She was also surprised to find that there was no other single guy in the room.</p> <p>She turned to leave. "What time is this?"</p> <p>"I don't know for sure. It'll be about a half hour."</p> <p>"Well that would give me a minute."</p> <p>"No, come on...I'm tired. I'm going to take a minute to freshen up."</p> <p>"Don't bother. I already told you I just went in to take a shower and I'm going to grab the drinks and go to bed."</p> <p>She turned around to see that his eyes had roamed the room before she had seen them. She looked down at herself and immediately realized that she had changed her own clothes.</p> <p>What happened to him?</p> <p>She looked down at herself again. No, I can't do this.</p> <p>"Honey, I'm sorry, I don't know what to say anymore."</p> <p>"But, he said, 'I'll call you later.' And that's true. I'm sorry and I want to make sure this stays between us. But I have to get ready. I can't seem to find anyone else here who is still looking good enough."</p> <p>"And you are going to call me again in a few minutes."</p> <p>In a couple of minutes he would be gone for a half hour, but she hoped he would call again tomorrow.</p> <p>She finished getting ready and began putting on the lingerie. It was a white garter belt, black stockings and black heels. She pulled a light colored dress over her head and was getting ready to sit down when she heard a noise in the hallway. Opening the door, she saw him laying on the bed asleep. Looking down to his feet, she noticed that his dress had ridden up her thigh. She walked towards him and began walking towards him. "Bobby, wake up..."</p> <p>He was breathing slightly harder as sleep went over him. She walked over until she was sitting at his feet. She turned around, her breasts hanging down and he could only see the side. She reached down to his belt and undid his zipper. He opened his eyes and took a quick look around.</p> <p>"Who was in there?"</p> <p>"Nobody. I guess I just wanted to get out of my clothes..."</p> <p>In a few seconds, his semi-erection got a full hard-on.</p> <p>"Honey, would you please let me do that for once?"</p> <p>"If it will please you."</p> <p>"Hmmmm, okay. I'll try."</p> <p>She walked towards him and his penis was bobbing up and down with his heartbeat. She took it in her hand and began massaging it.</p> <p>"Just relax and feel it."</p> <p>She took it in one hand and began rubbing up and down slowly. She took her hands up and down slowly, enjoying her own soft hands.</p> <p>"Mmmmm. Yeah...that's good."</p> <p>"How does it feel?"</p> <p>"It feels good, baby. Don't stop."</p> <p>He was already on his side away from her and he didn't even have time to wonder. He laid his head on her chest and began kissing her nipples. She could see him getting harder by the second and so she decided to rub her hand along his leg. It did feel good and she felt her panties getting wetter with each stroke she made along his shin.</p> <p>"Okay baby, do you want to do this again?"</p> <p>"Well...yeah...I have some things to do tomorrow..."</p> <p>"Yeah. Can I sleep with you tonight?"</p> <p>"Sure. Thanks. I love you."</p> <p>They lay there for a few more minutes, and then they began kissing again. She reached her hand down to his dick and he took it in his hand.</p> <p>"Is this what you wanted?"</p> <p>"Oh yeah. It felt really good, my hand was stroking your dick while I was kissing your lips and tongue."</p> <p>"God I love you with all my heart. I love your kisses too; I could get lost in them all year. You are so sexy."</p> <p>"I think you know thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
