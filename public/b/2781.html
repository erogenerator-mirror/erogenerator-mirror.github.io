Her body was bare, save a skimpy string between her breasts that wrapped around her midsection and tied back at her shoulder. She sat in a chair, allowing the water to slosh over her chest and run up along her back. She lifted the back of her skirt, allowing me unrestricted view of her bare legs.</p> <p>I stared, mesmerized as my tongue began to twitch as I continued licking and exploring her pussy with my eyes, her scent filling my nostrils. The water splashed down onto my face, covering my entire body.</p> <p>My dick, rock hard, throbbing in my hand, aching, begging to be released from the confines of my pants.</p> <p>"Please," she whispered, "Just fuck me." In her hand she held my shaft, her words leaving me dizzy, her eyes gleaming in the light.</p> <p>I could tell I had the will power to resist and I dropped the water as quickly as I could. My body went into motion and I stepped out of the tub as she quickly climbed into the water, quickly closing the door. She took my face in her hands and pressed her mouth to mine. Her lips were soft, her tongue a sensual caress as they met in a torrid kiss. It was as if the two most incredible lovers could live in the moment.</p> <p>I reached for her once more, her hands pressing me to the edge of the tub, her hips straddling mine. My tongue pressed to hers as she reached behind her with both hands to unfasten the button on my pants and work the zipper down. I moaned her name in frustration as she began to push me out. Her pussy was glistening with water and, I realized, she was already soaking wet, too.</p> <p>I moved to remove her dress, her hands reaching up to help. She tugged the zipper down one last time, dropping the thin straps of her bra so they spilled over her shoulders. She smiled when she saw my expression of desire and desire reflected in my own; she sat on the edge of me and pulled my shirt out in long kisses.</p> <p>My hands moved to her hips and I pulled her tight against me, pressing my swollen tool to her belly. She slid down my body, my cock easily slipping between her lips. Her heat spread along the length of my shaft and her own desire made her mouth as slippery as hers. I moaned as her tongue slid into my mouth.</p> <p>My hands moved up to grasp her tits as she slowly rose from the tub, her eyes fixed on mine but she only returned half-smiled smile. I took one of her perky nipple in my mouth and sucked it gently, drawing it from between my lips and sucking on it again. She pushed her body against me, grinding her pussy against my swollen member. Her hips grinded against mine and she arched upward, giving me a view of her ass and her pussy.</p> <p>"Please, Paul," she whispered, "I want it so badly."</p> <p>I didn't have to wait long. I quickly pulled her toward me, our mouths meeting as I lifted her up onto the edge of the tub and slid inside her. "Fuck me," she cried, her eyes glazed with desire. When I began to thrust my penis in and out of her pussy it was as if it were not happening, only that we were actually fucking.</p> <p>I couldn't think as I began to thrust into her. We met, her breasts smashed against my chest, her body impaled on the side of the tub and her legs around me. She began to buck her hips against me, her moans filling the bathroom, urging me to fuck her harder. I thrust into her harder, harder, my balls tightening. I pulled on her nipple tightly, squeezing her body tight around me, her body shaking against me. I felt like I was going to come, but I could feel her legs tighten as she approached her own release.</p> <p>"Oh God....fuck....oh...." she whispered, "Fuck me."</p> <p>I thrust deeper into her, my hands cupping her ass as my hips slammed against hers, my cock impaling her completely as my semen shot up my cock and into her belly. She held me to her as her orgasm surged through her; our skin slapped together with each thrust. I kept fucking her, milking every last drop of cum out of my shaft before pulling out of her. I dropped her back down onto my body and she continued to shudder from the aftermath of her orgasm as the water continued to rain down on us.</p> <p>Suddenly she slid my shaft out of her and stood up, her hand sliding through the water while she wrapped her wet arms around my neck. Her lips found mine and our tongues began to dance over one another as I rolled her onto her back. We kissed as I pushed her skirtâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
