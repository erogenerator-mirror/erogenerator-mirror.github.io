"This is all about cumming," he said. "I'm so close...I need to cum."</p> <p>"Oh, god..." I said. He fucked even faster, and harder, and came, groaning and yelling "fuck me" and "cunt" and "fart". He grunted and pulled away from me, looking down at me with his now black eyes. "That was good," he said. "Good. I'm going to fuck you until you're full of cum. You cum whenever you want." He reached down and pulled off his shorts, revealing a huge stiff penis that looked so much bigger than any man I'd ever seen, it barely fit inside my pussy. It was longer than my boyfriend, but not nearly as good looking. His hand touched my face lightly, and I could feel sweat run down the side of his face. His grip tightened on me, and I instinctively wrapped my legs around his waist and clamped my thighs around his cock.</p> <p>"Yeah, baby," he said. "That's about right. Let go of me like you do for your first time, and let's see just how good you are." He grabbed the back of my thighs and thrust himself as far as he could into me as I had. My back arched and I felt my body start to pulse with pleasure as he let go of me. His hands grabbed my head, and his face became red with sweat as he began to fuck my face. It was difficult to breath so I held onto the edge of the tub until he pulled free of me and I felt my tongue run across my lips, tasting his sweaty body. "You taste so good," he said. "You taste great on a girl's cock."</p> <p>"I love it," I said. "You taste good." He stepped out of the tub and reached out to me, sliding a soft washcloth over my head and down the side of my neck. "You have a beautiful body," he said. He stood me up slowly, my legs shaking from this long day of foreplay and him. He pulled me to him, and then kissed me. It felt so good to feel him inside of me. "Let's get dried off and get you something to eat."</p> <p>"Oh...right...I think..." I said as my eyes closed and my head rested on his shoulder.</p> <p>He was still wearing his bathrobe, and as he dropped it over my legs I saw his massive erection was beginning to harden even more. "You want me in bed?" he asked.</p> <p>"Well...if it's okay with you," I said, already starting to feel like I was falling for the guy. And I had to admit, it didn't seem wrong.</p> <p>"Yeah, I'd really love it," he said. He kissed me softly again and pulled me close. "Let's get dressed," he said. He turned me around so I was standing with my back to the wet tiles. He knelt down and ran his tongue and fingers from my feet to my calves, while I sat on the bathroom floor in just the wet thong. He sucked on my toes, while he slid his finger down my crack, then back up the crack. His tongue slid in and out of my cunt, while his hand stroked my thigh. When he finally got to the back of my thong I threw my legs open and ran a hand under his throat, making him breathe hard. "Oh shit," I said. "Did I tell you it wasn't just water?" as I put my finger in his mouth to clean up.</p> <p>"You are the best, baby," he said as he pulled both legs through the side of his robe. "And your pussy tastes so good - don't you just love it?"</p> <p>"I love it," I said as I stood in front of him.</p> <p>"You want us to get in bed together?"</p> <p>"Yes, I want us to get you into bed together. Where do you want to go?"</p> <p>"We'll go to bed together," he said. "In my bed. If I'm not here when you go to bed, what about I get to come get you tonight?"</p> <p>"We'll sleep together."</p> <p>He slipped the panties into the hamper and stood up as I sat on the hard floor. He lifted my legs onto his shoulders so his body was between them. "Let's see if we can't put these things on," he said. He slid my thong out of the way as he slid himself onto my lap. I reached between us and felt the outline of his big cock between his legs. He slowly took my thong and slipped it up my thighs, over my ass and balls and off my legs before tying it with another two strings. I raised my legs higher, and they rested aroundâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
