She put her arms around my neck, pulling me down for a long kiss.</p> <p>"It wasn't my doing or your fault," I insisted. I turned to kiss her and she pulled me away. "I need to go." She turned me around, and kissed me like a woman possessed, but this time with more of a firmness and passion.</p> <p>"I'll never forget that kiss," she promised, and without hesitation she turned me around, bending me over the bed. She started to undress first and pulled off my panties, then reached up from behind and undid my belt and zipper. She pulled them down and I stepped out of them.</p> <p>The cool, slick feel of the rubber around my aching cock was all it took. I had never had anal sex, let alone a pussy or a mouth. It had never felt so good to have it in my ass, and now I was going to try my best to be an anal virgin. I had never had anything inserted inside me like this before. The combination of nerves and the rubber on my aching dick was too much. "I need..." I began, but she raised her hand to her mouth and looked at it. "I need it inside me." She said, as she turned me around, and pushed me down to lean against the headboard of the bed.</p> <p>I lifted my ass, and she turned it to face the head. She leaned down to the bed and moved the head down to lay flat against my stomach. She looked into my eyes, and bent down to kiss me again. Her hands pushed down my body, and I felt two fingers pushing inside me, rubbing hard over my inner walls, all the way to my swollen and red rosebud. She pushed hard again, and I felt her thumb slide into me and she started to pull out, then push back in again. Again, slowly and firmly.</p> <p>She pulled out almost all the way and pressed back into me, and I was in ecstasy.</p> <p>She started to rub my prostate as she pushed in and out of me with her fingers. I closed my eyes and tried to make herself feel better, but it was difficult and I couldn't seem to do it. Her hands worked against my body, and I was so turned on at this point that I found a new level of pleasure that I didn't fully understand. It would take everything I had to remain quiet to keep from squealing as my orgasm hit me.</p> <p>She continued to rub my prostate, pushing and pulling, moving me almost straight back and forth. I was close and she worked with me until my face was flushed and I was afraid that I was going to suffocate. Then she pulled out completely and pushed back into me once again. She pulled out all the way and began to rub my prostate a little faster. She pushed in into me once more and reached around for my cock. She rubbed it with her fingertips, and when I started to feel like I was going to come again, she pulled out, pushing just part of my erection with her finger to give herself the best possible angle. I gasped and tried to arch my back and push more of my chest into the mattress.</p> <p>Then she pushed in hard again, pushing in and back out. I couldn't feel another man, and it was only the feel of my dick stuffed in her. She held back, almost not touching my dick, and she pulled out and pushed in hard again. She held it in her as I felt how slick it was, and I was starting to relax as a second finger reached into me. Again, she pushed in hard. I closed my eyes and my mind swam, and my hips bucked up at the contact. I felt my orgasm building again, and she pulled out and began to rub my prostate again. I closed my eyes and lost all sense of reality. I wasn't sure where I was anymore, but the pleasure that I was feeling was a new level of pleasure to me. Her fingers kept going, pushing in me hard and fast.</p> <p>I opened my eyes and just stared into hers, feeling her muscles start to squeeze as she pulled all the way out and then push all the way back. I felt her hands on my chest, rubbing and pushing me back down with each thrust and every slow, deep thrust until she was in my ass again. She pulled it in and out, and when I felt her thumb begin to rub over my tiny prostate she pulled it out and pushed it back in. She kept pushing, and it felt incredible. It was all I could do to keep from just screaming out, but instead I managed to grunt, and I started to grind on her hand. Her fingers were back at work, and her thumb began to rub my ass, and I arched my back and pushed harder into her.</p> <p>After about a minute she stopped, and slid out completelyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
