I'm not quite sure why. Maybe it's because you are so pretty I can't really put it into words."</p> <p>"That's sweet of you to say, but yes, I like it. And if it's okay with you, I would love it even more. I've been asked many times before, but I never have."</p> <p>She was quiet a moment, and for a moment, I thought I was hearing a conversation between the two of them alone, but then I looked at her again and she opened her eyes, looked at me, her cheeks blushing slightly as she looked at me, and said.</p> <p>"What...?"</p> <p>"Come, I'll be honest too. You are gorgeous."</p> <p>A bit embarrassed I stood, my cock hard and straining against my pants.</p> <p>"If I didn't think you'd like it... what...I...I'm a bit embarrassed," I said, trying to think of a way to apologize for the embarrassing way that we had started without stopping.</p> <p>"That's okay."</p> <p>"I was talking about how I've been asking you several times, and...if it's okay with you..."</p> <p>"It's okay, I was just wondering, if you want to use the hand-brush with the brush instead, and just maybe...just to keep it fresh, and...just to keep it pretty."</p> <p>"You are beautiful Miss."</p> <p>"And as beautiful as you are." And she leaned forward and, holding my chin in her finger, kissed me.</p> <p>It was as passionate a kiss that we shared, and it left me breathless. My lips and tongue were still in the warmest place for a second or two, and as they parted, I felt her soft lips press hard against mine. The moment was sweet, her tongue, strong and quick, and we both groaned with pleasure. Again, she pulled back, my fingers stroking her arm, which remained in the lap of her chair, her hand still stroking her breast. We looked toward the windows, still looking out into the open air, her lips still on mine.</p> <p>My mind was racing over what had happened the instant we shared our embrace. I didn't think I would ever be so happy to be this close to her again, to that time in her classroom.</p> <p>"You okay?" I asked, taking in the look on her face, now covered in goose bumps.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm so...so good...you know, it's a bit awkward...but...I just don't know how to say this," she said, looking up at me from under her eyelashes. She reached out and ran a single finger along my jaw line.</p> <p>"Sh, I would have to keep myself in check. I...uh...you're...just...so...beautiful. And...in...those...tights....you're...beautiful."</p> <p>Her eyes were moist, and my heart was racing as she talked to me, her words and gaze penetrating, captivating.</p> <p>"Oh, Miss, we had a lot of fun," she exclaimed, pulling me down onto the couch next to her. With her free hand, she took my chin and turned my face to hers for a long moment. Our lips met, soft, wet, and passionate, exploring, exploring to the core. After a moment, she released me, and I sat up, watching her with a strange look. When she was ready to be asked the question again, I had no idea what she wanted to ask other than "so what happened there and what's going on with you, and...well..."</p> <p>"Sh," she said, and pulled me to my feet. She pulled her skirt off, and I had to move quickly to do it. As I stood, I had to close my eyes, both nervous and excited. My stomach was turning in anticipation, and for a moment, I worried that it was going to turn into an embarrassing evening together.</p> <p>"Mornin'" she said as she pulled my zipper and slid the briefs down together with them. Then she was right back to holding my cock in both hands, looking it over as she stroked it and kissed it.</p> <p>"I don't want to tell you what's going on in there," she said, "But I think we should probably be doing something else first."</p> <p>It occurred to me that all this time, we had been naked and fondling each other, and that this was the most comfortable thing she had ever done.
