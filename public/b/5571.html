Her head fell to the side and a contented smile came over her face.</p> <p>"Thank you," she whispered. "You make me feel so....gifted".</p> <p>"You're welcome," I replied and went over to lay down next to her.</p> <p>"How do I compare to you?" she asked me as she turned on her side and faced me. Her hand rested on my hip and her breasts were inches from my crotch.</p> <p>My hand came down to caress her thigh, and she shifted to scoot toward me. I pulled back the covers so I was sitting up and she joined me as I leaned over to embrace her. Our lips touched as I traced up her jaw with my teeth, then down her neck until I felt the small valley between her breasts. When I traced the valley with my fingers and began to caress her flesh, her fingers tightened in my hair.</p> <p>"Mmm, I like feeling your touch," she said and we stayed like that for maybe ten minutes.</p> <p>My fingers teased her until her breathing got deeper and she began writhing against my cock. It slid from her ass crack down her thigh and onto the bed, leaving a moist trail as it traveled down her flat stomach. She shifted again and I began to slide my hand back up to her breasts until they were cupped in my hand.</p> <p>"I like you in bed with me," she said. "I wish you were....," her sentence ended as she leaned toward me and we kissed.</p> <p>I felt as if I should stop this right then. It was the last thing I wanted to do. I'd never have sex with anyone so perfect and beautiful, no one else. I mean, maybe she had the best breasts I've ever seen, but she had the skimpiest, smoothest pussy, and the sweetest pussy I've ever had the pleasure of sliding my cock in. So it was as if my actions on her were an accident. But her tongue, her warm lips, her soft touch and the warmth of her breasts and the sweet taste of her mouth as she took my cock deep into her mouth gave me a raging hard on as if I were in her ass in the car.</p> <p>I rolled her back onto her back and we kissed. I couldn't get enough of her mouth, her kiss. Her full pink lips were soft and yielding, and her tongue slid in and out of my mouth as I tasted her. My fingers were tracing the rise of her cheeks and her breathing was becoming more pronounced.</p> <p>Suddenly, she pulled back.</p> <p>"I can't," she said. "I have plans for tomorrow."</p> <p>"Oh, I have plans for tomorrow."</p> <p>I was a little taken aback. "Uh-huh." Her question didn't ring true.</p> <p>"Yeah. I have plans for tomorrow." Her question implied her having plans, which I didn't think were out of line.</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Oh yeah," she said. "I was wondering... if the things we have been doing together are....."</p> <p>I was not going to put anything in her face at this point. She was serious. And she was gorgeous. I was glad she was with me and so was I. And, by God, her voice didn't sound as though she was in pain. She smiled at me with pleasure, and I could tell she was loving this too. Not knowing what to say, I gave in.</p> <p>"Sure," I said.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah. I was afraid you'd say that." She wasn't going to argue though, so I just closed the door on the first call I made, and got up and walked to the couch in the living room. She looked over to the bed where I had just gone but got up and came to sit down with me. I took her hand and raised it to my lips. We kissed and I kissed her breasts and her cheeks and her neck and her lips. I took her left breast into my mouth and swirled my tongue round the tip. She pulled my hair and moaned softly. Her body was moving up and down with each kiss and she moaned again when my lips found her nipple, which had been rock hard and erect all day. I slowly sucked her entire tit into my mouth and flicked the nipple with my tongue and swirled the tip again. My fingers slid under her panties where I pressed her and pushed her panties down a little. I pulled them off and let them slide past her knees and up to her thighs and they ended up over my own shoes. I pulled them away from here and then went back to sucking her breasts again. She kissed me again and I ran my fingers over her skin, and she kissed me back with greater fervor.</p> <p>I moved my hands toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
