"Hello?"</p> <p>"Hey, I was just thinking we should hang out some."</p> <p>"Oh really, I'm all ears, do you know how to do that?"</p> <p>"No, I need to work something out, could you give me your number so I can call you tomorrow?"</p> <p>"Sure, I have it right here on my desk if you want to go to work." A little bit of uncertainty in his voice as he said it.</p> <p>"Ok, I'll tell you all about it in the morning." She promised her and then hung up.</p> <p>After hanging up she just flopped down on the couch next to her and turned the page of the TV. As the day went on and the phone call came, she would try to make conversation with Michael, but when it came to the movie, he would just let her think on it and take the words of the movie.</p> <p>As the phone conversation went on, she closed down her mind and went to sleep.</p> <p>The next day was fairly uneventful for Michael and she spent the rest of her day sitting in her living room, wondering what to do next. What Michael had planned for the evening was beyond exciting and all she could do was wonder if he would want to go to bed with her.</p> <p>That night when he returned from work, it was almost too late to turn in, so with another plan he told her. As he dropped his overnight bag on her couch, she just thought, 'why not?" and as he handed her the envelope containing the letter he just left by that man in a red light, she just took it and sat there thinking.</p> <p>As Michael went about getting ready for work, he had a good feeling about what he had in mind. First he wanted to spend as much time with her as he could and he wanted to be with her when no one was around the house. He just thought that it might be fun to surprise her by telling her a little more of what to do and if she liked what he had planned for dinner, so to speak.</p> <p>That evening, Michael returned from work just as she did when he went to bed, as usual. This time he was waiting for her just sitting there as he came around the table.</p> <p>He asked if she would like some dessert since he loved to get something into her that he couldn't really explain to the woman who sat just at the end of the table a few minutes before him. As it turned out, she didn't want to say anything, just looked at him as he sat down on the side of the table and poured himself a drink and got another surprise for her.</p> <p>He had found the ice pack on the coffee table and had found the top of it missing from under the coffee pot and he turned his drink around so he could get a bit of a taste. "Oh, this is so exciting" he thought to himself. He knew that she would enjoy his attentions, however it had to be at this moment since he hadn't told her how much he enjoyed that dessert too.</p> <p>After he finished that dinner and had his desert, he picked up his phone to check on how much time it would take before he would send it to her so he could give it to her as soon as possible. Once he had his phone back on, Michael made his call to her. "Hey, how was the surprise?... I have to go for a while today, you know, work, so I'm going to get out more tonight."</p> <p>"Oh yes... yes, we could come back another time... that is, if you would like we can do it again sometime."</p> <p>"Would we do that if I would like?"</p> <p>"Of course. But what if it's late and I don't want to do it, are you sure you wouldn't like the other time?"</p> <p>"No, not really... it's no bother, just enjoy it with me, but don't forget about the other times you get. OK, do you want to bring me up to speed on everything, OK?"</p> <p>"You really got me going today in the store... I just love it when you do that for me."</p> <p>"That's good, I love when you do that for me. And even if it means not doing it to someone else, I'm still sure you'll feel the same."</p> <p>"You don't know how much I really love that. And it's not just for me, it's because you're everything to me that I want to be... not just for youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
