By the time we had eaten I was feeling more alive than I'd been in years. That first night spent under a blanket was wonderful, but the last night being a sleepover in the hotel with her parents I was left feeling empty.</p> <p>I was wearing boxer shorts to cover my erection. I was glad my shirt was not wrinkled when she pulled her top off and stood up to let me see her lovely breasts. She had a very pretty and sexy look to her - her bra covered breasts, not the titties of a boy next door or the soft little tush of a woman.</p> <p>"Do you think we will be able to get it up again?" she asked with a playful smile.</p> <p>We went and lay down to watch a movie until she had enough courage to climb up in her bed. One thing she did not want to do was to be the first woman to climb in her bed to be the first to give me a blow job. Her parents would be at home too.</p> <p>I could hardly believe that she had been in that position with me in our bed the night before I could no longer feel jealous from her and I actually had to make a move to get my cock back inside her. She was a lovely woman but not really what I would call a slut.</p> <p>She was just what I had needed. A beautiful woman who could have been mine, as a whole man should be, if I could handle a woman.</p> <p>After we had showered and changed I told her all I had been thinking about was her getting fucked.</p> <p>"Come to my room with me," I said. "I want you to take off all your clothes."</p> <p>"I suppose I will," she replied. "Is that better?"</p> <p>"Oh yes," I replied. "It better if you do not ask questions." Then leaning over to put a gentle kiss on her lips, I whispered in her ear, "Are you all the way ready."</p> <p>"I guess it will be. And we can hurry or do it while we are under the cover. I'm not really sure." Then she smiled as I slipped my shorts off before standing up and walking across the room to join her.</p> <p>Just having gone through that incredible experience made it so much better. She was just what I had wanted - a woman and a good loverâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
