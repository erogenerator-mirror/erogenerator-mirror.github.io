All I could think was, "Yes I guess you do."</p> <p>I looked up into Amy's face and noticed that she was still laying on her back, although her eyes were still closed. "What the hell? You're still not asleep and you obviously have that strange dream!"</p> <p>She looked up at me and with a wicked grin said. "Oh baby this is the best! Now let's get some sleep."</p> <p>With that she rolled over onto all fours and crawled out of my bed. When I got out of the bathroom, Amy was gone, leaving me with my wife.</p> <p>*</p> <p>I woke up the next morning with my mouth full of one of the most delicious smelling breakfast food I would ever have. I guess it was breakfast since when I had a chance to have those with breakfast the previous week. It had my entire morning to kill and I got myself ready for the day.</p> <p>Just as I was about to take a short shower and shave my legs I noticed Amy was down stairs in the kitchen.</p> <p>"Morning babe," she said.</p> <p>I quickly got my shower and got dressed in a pair of sweat shorts and a tee shirt.</p> <p>I had just gotten in when I heard a knock on the bathroom door. I looked up and saw Amy standing in the doorway with an evil grin on her face.</p> <p>"Oh hi honey," Amy said as she took a step back from me. "Last night wasn't as bad as I've had it!"</p> <p>I looked at her and for some reason looked a little awkward. But I guess she knew that as badly as I still felt about her fucking my brains out.</p> <p>"I just got back from a visit with Brian last night," Amy said.</p> <p>"Oh that must have been nice to you," I said. "What are you going to do today?"</p> <p>She shook her head. "I planned on eating dinner first, but I really got hungry. This is only a quickie but I'd love to have you at my place by six tomorrow."</p> <p>We spent that day at the local burger joint and I couldn't help but sneak back a couple of times to give out some hot hugs to my two best friends.</p> <p>Since Amy said she knew Brian's wife and she knew the best way to get Brian and I together that week we made plans to call in the day of her birthday so she could go out with him to the park.</p> <p>*</p> <p>We all finished our morning by taking a nice long shower together and I was surprised that it wasn't all that late.</p> <p>"We've got some shopping to do," Amy said walking into the kitchen wearing a pair of sweat pants and a t-shirt. "Can't wait to get out of the house, the last thing we need is my dad getting into the house all on our account."</p> <p>I thought a minute or two and realized that she was still dressed to go out.</p> <p>"I'm still naked so I don't have to go into the kitchen naked," I said.</p> <p>Amy laughed at that. "Too bad that's still with me."</p> <p>I got dressed as she went to get her shopping.</p> <p>*</p> <p>A couple of days later after we all ate and got ready for our little date I called in the day early to pick her up. It was already four after four.</p> <p>We decided to go to a few nice restaurants for lunch and some drinks. We had gone to a couple of nice places along the way and a coffee shop just south of town.</p> <p>After lunch we headed back to Amy's with our bags. She was standing at her front door with two young men. They were both in their late twenties. Brian was tall with short brown hair. I was pretty sure he was the second one.</p> <p>Neither of them had the chance to say a word.</p> <p>"Hi guys," I said as I walked by them. "Hope I didn't interrupt your date?"</p> <p>"I'm fine honey," Brian said with a smile on his face. "Just waiting for you to get back from that tour with Steve."</p> <p>I went back out front.</p> <p>Steve was the one that greeted me as I came out of the kitchen behind Amy. "Brought you back Amy! Is she still there?"</p> <p>She looked down at herself. "She's here," Amy answered as she walked toward me.</p> <p>Steve was standing in the doorway and the first thing he noticed was Amy walking out the door.</p> <p>"Hi guys, I'm Steve," he said. This was new territory for me. He was just as tall as Brian and more attractive in fact.</p> <p>I was slightly put off and looked at the two young men with my usual nervousness. I was not exactly sure howâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
