She felt wonderful.</p> <p>"That was fabulous!"</p> <p>"I can't believe our new friends are coming!"</p> <p>"We had a party! How could you put up a show on television? What the hell were you going to get us?" She had been looking at David a good half mile down the street before he'd gone down the street to get a newspaper, but now she could see he'd got the newspaper. She thought what he'd get if things went a bit differently. Then she thought about what she had said about getting a good sex party.</p> <p>"I suppose that's a good thing," she replied as David looked really pleased. "Don't be shocked, Heather, you were never going to get anywhere."</p> <p>Heather looked over at David for a moment before she stepped to him and leaned in close, "You and I are going to love to fuck!" she told him with a smile as she kissed him firmly, a real kiss like any other.</p> <p>David was still wondering what if anything of this kind would happen. But he'd seen that photo set he'd seen on the news. It was a photo of all the action going on for the big screen in New York. That was it. The excitement was just not there!</p> <p>"And you, well ..." Heather started to say to David as she leaned back in the lounge.</p> <p>"Of course I'm getting married!" She said to him smiling like the Cheshire cat, "but I'll have to make use of some of the things that I saw. Come on, I'm going into the kitchen to get the cocktails.</p> <p>"OK, Heather," David said as he followed her.</p> <p>"You're going to put it on, aren't you?!" she exclaimed as he went through the kitchen to the rear of the house.</p> <p>"Yes, OK." But at the back of the house there was a room with a window on it. David opened the door for her. Heather followed him as he went into the bedroom. David turned on the overhead light. His dress was just about half way on he looked in the mirror. But instead of the typical dark blue blouse and black skirt, she'd decided to instead wore a soft and fluffy white satin nightdress. It looked like a teddi but really she liked the way it made her look and feel so much more voluptuous. She watched herself in the mirror as she did it, the blouse, the satin and see satin of the satin flaps and silk of the satin.</p> <p>"Wow!"</p> <p>She said to herself in the mirror "I am a bit silly, thinking that a couple of years after we got married, we went upstairs to get a shower and I was just thinking that maybe you wanted to wash my body! OK, not quite the answer, but I'll tell you what I'd like to do and ..." she reached under the dress and slipped a finger into the satin and felt, just for a moment, that she'd missed out on the most intimate part of her body.</p> <p>"Ooh" said David to himself as he turned the light off and sat down to take his drink.</p> <p>"So ..." she said as she looked back at David. She smiled at him, knowing what he must now be thinking and feeling and not bothering to do any kind of work.</p> <p>"So, David, you like me dressed as you like me? And you still want me to give you a hand job?" she said to him, "That's just fantastic! You did just look so good in front of me! I was in a hurry. If I'd known you would want me to show you everything, I would have gone with just one touch. I really thought I did you for my own pleasure."</p> <p>"Yeah, yeah, that's why it was so perfect you do it yourself, but I do you for my pleasure." He told her.</p> <p>She slipped her hand under the thin satin and lifted her dress. After a bit of movement it slid up. It was quite transparent.</p> <p>"And there is one more thing you should do!" Heather said as she opened her satin knickers. She felt almost like she'd left them behind at the cleaners after her shopping trip in the dark, all wetted and slippery and clinging as the silk slid over that part. She smiled up at David for a final moment.</p> <p>"OK, you've done me for your own pleasure, now let's get these back off."</p> <p>"Right, OK, what did you want me to be doing?"</p> <p>"Nothing. Let me do you for my pleasure."</p> <p>"OK, I'll stand up and lean back onto you."</p> <p>David turned his chair round so that Heather could lay herselfâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
