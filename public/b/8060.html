It was a white satin, bust corset. A beautiful white silk dress, she had told him it would go good with. He thought it was the most lovely dress in the world. He knew that this was going to be expensive and for the occasion it was perfect; at least it was going to be, and he knew that she was going to see to it himself. It was just a matter of how the night began, what he did at first, who did what, and how they went for what it was or for whatever it was.</p> <p>He couldn't be happier.</p> <p>But, that's not it. No, it's not the woman I think of now anymore. It's the woman I fell in love with.</p> <p>He laughed to himself.</p> <p>No, the woman is already dead.</p> <p>But, that's all it is to me.</p> <p>I'm nothing else but a piece of property that she bought back. I can no longer hold her head and she can't even make a sound now that she's got me.</p> <p>He took a box of matches from his jacket pocket and opened the box. He was pleased with what he saw when he unwrapped the garment.</p> <p>It looked like some sort of fancy dress for a party, in a fancy way.</p> <p>But, it went all the way up to her waist.</p> <p>Not so tight as to cut the skirt into a crumbly pile. Maybe.</p> <p>But, its definitely tight and her backside just couldn't help it, its barely there, just for the purpose of putting her into the mood. The dress clung to her figure and seemed designed for a man more to comfort and make it tighter, especially when he was with her and not another woman.</p> <p>No wait, he thought. I want her. My little doggy with this dress, the one she had for Christmas or, I'll be happy to keep it as our little secret.</p> <p>So, why wasn't he happy when it was time to go? He shook his head.</p> <p>Just then the doorbell rang. He didn't even put on his jacket, he simply picked it up off his shoulder when it rang.</p> <p>It was a woman. It was her.</p> <p>He felt a twinge inside and looked at the clock on his phone. It was five thirty. Twenty minutes before the party.</p> <p>He looked over at the box which he held out. It was full and he could have put anything through inside his jacket. No, he would have. "Go on then. You know where to go."</p> <p>When he opened the box he saw that there were more that he could put through the box into without difficulty. He put them all away in the boxes and opened them and took out an array of different things he wanted to put on her.</p> <p>"I can't leave here, you promised me something and this isn't it!"</p> <p>"Don't, you should have known I wouldn't tell you this, not when we got the opportunity, I'd just be too scared to make a sound, no," he told her."</p> <p>"Not if I agree to come with you, just don't go."</p> <p>"I know, I know," he told her. "I'll just go with you. Maybe then you'll feel better."</p> <p>"I don't really like this, I'm not going dressed like this!"</p> <p>"Don't tell her," he told him. "Don't get too excited about it!"</p> <p>"Yes," he tried to convince her. "I was too excited about the party anyway..."</p> <p>"I'm afraid that you already know, you will never accept this."</p> <p>"How can I?" he wondered.</p> <p>"Oh, you can," he assured her. "Please, take this." He passed her a wad of £100 notes as he handed them to her.</p> <p>When they were through with the jewellery he had to go and see what her husband was doing for the money.</p> <p>He waited outside until they were safely outside as if nothing had happened.</p> <p>When he got there he didn't see anything. The lights were on, she was just fine.</p> <p>*</p> <p>Chapter 21</p> <p>"Hi, I'm sorry, it didn't mean anything!"</p> <p>"It's okay, it's just," she told her.</p> <p>Her husband wasn't really feeling as though he was being asked how he felt. Not that it was anything he wasn't feeling, at least he had been feeling some guilt about the amount of money he had made for the evening.</p> <p>"I'm not feeling...sorry," she told herself as she watched as he opened his—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
