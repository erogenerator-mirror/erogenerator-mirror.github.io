She wanted to say something. Instead ... her body stiffened.</p> <p>"God, I'm sorry." she murmured, her voice shaking slightly.</p> <p>I couldn't let that happen. I'd never heard her like this.</p> <p>She was trembling. She was wet ... in fact ....</p> <p>I stood up. Her back was turned to me, and every muscle of her body clenched. I took in the sight of her trembling body. Her long, long blonde hair cascid over her shoulders, her soft, angelic face. She had a big nose, but hers had filled out nicely. It was only at that moment, when she looked back at me, I noticed, that I'd left my cock out of the way to give her room to sit on it. She'd had to stop herself from moving to touch it.</p> <p>The next thing I knew, she was standing at my side with her legs spread, one hand sliding to her pussy ... and with a big grin on her face, she slowly, and very skillfully, began fingering her pussy, sliding her middle finger in and out of her pussy, sliding it in again and again, and, oh God, ...</p> <p>We stayed like that for what seemed like forever. I knew that she'd come. And she was.</p> <p>Then I gently pushed her toward my lap, and she stopped just in time.</p> <p>"Jesus, I love the way you're touching me." She said, still holding her hand out for me. I took her hand and guided her back to my lap. I ran my hands up her soft, slim leg, and over her leg and between her legs. I slid my hand up my wife's inner thigh toward her pussy. Then, when I reached her pussy lips, I stroked them, feeling the wetness of her juices still clinging to her sex and covering them in the wetness of her arousal. The warmth of her pussy felt incredible. And she was still in my lap. I slid another finger into her pussy, feeling her muscles tighten around my finger as she started to orgasm. Her clit was fully erect, and she trembled as I stroked her through her orgasm. I moved my fingers again, to her other thigh, and again back to her clit. And again ... again ... over and over again until ...</p> <p>She didn't come again. She was trembling in her own release. But no matter how much she tried to hold back, the pleasure that she'd been feeling from my fingers, my cock, her tongue, I knew there was no way she would be able to hold back her orgasm, even if she wanted to. But she was. She was on fire and needed to come again, and then.</p> <p>And she did. She cried out and bit her lower lip. Her body jerked and shook in her own orgasm as it swept over her, and finally, she slumped onto my cock. Neither of us moved. She just lay there, as I wrapped my arms around her and kissed the top of her head .</p> <p>And to be honest, I don't think I've ever come in her pussy like that before. There was so much of the feeling that I was getting from you in it, too. You could say that, for all you knew: I knew ... I should be the only virgin in my town with a hard cock, and that was all I could ever want. But we're not talking about fucking ... we're talking about being in love. We've just been talking about love and sharing, and I'm still thinking about what we've done. You're the only man in the whole town, and I know we'll be going off to college to be alone one day and find that outâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
