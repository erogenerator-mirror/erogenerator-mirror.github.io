It was no longer about her oral pleasures me in the least. It was about him, her, and us.</p> <p></p> <p>His tongue then penetrated me more deeply.</p> <p></p> <p>She held his head in her hands then pushed him up to lie under her in the tub. She looked down on him and watched as his eyes closed slightly and his face turned to the back of a little.</p> <p></p> <p>His head was still under her but as she turned slightly and her hands moved from his face to his arms and back down to wrap them about her.</p> <p></p> <p>Then, holding his head in her hands, she looked down on him again, and held him in her arms.</p> <p></p> <p>"Good boy...good boy." She said softly. "Now..." she said more firmly now, "you get to fuck your Mommy. Please."</p> <p></p> <p>Her voice, her hand and look as they both now stared up at her, as the word I knew it had never taken on to form in her mind. And now it felt, not only good, more intimate, but yet felt too natural, to hurt or disrespect or insult her.</p> <p></p> <p>Now she moved back, leaned into him and kissed him hard, hard enough to hurt.</p> <p></p> <p>We stood there, her holding his head there as she kissed his neck and shoulders. And her lips felt so full and soft and hot and sexy in their touching of his body. Her breath smelled as strong as mine against my body. She had been thinking about that in the shower a bit herself. But the touch of her, what she was doing right now, made me feel just a little different. It felt as though her hand was holding him and he was in her as she had so thoroughly taken him, taken his virginity, as he was taken by her.</p> <p></p> <p>"I love you...I always will." He breathed into my chest.</p> <p></p> <p>A look that had always passed between us was a look that spoke of the need, the love, for each other. Something in her voice said that she was the one in my love, in my life, with him, as he. Our hearts were in the same way.</p> <p></p> <p>As her hands moved between his body and mine and I stood beside them she leaned her head down for another kiss I could feel her breathing against me. And I felt her lips run down my chest, over my nipple, and then, when her lips touched my skin through my skirt, it was as though his mouth had opened a little, just barely, and she was touching me there.</p> <p></p> <p>Then she looked up at me as she kissed me. And she kissed me with the most tender and loving passion the woman could dream just to kiss me.</p> <p></p> <p>"Do you want me to fuck you, Tommy?" she whispered in my ear, "do you want me to fuck you?"</p> <p>"Yes." my voice came out husky against his chest, "Yes please, yes I want you fucking me."</p> <p></p> <p>Her lips met mine again, then she pushed his head down to where we shared a kiss, and we both kissed him, we took his body and kissed him, we hugged.</p> <p></p> <p>She looked down at him and held his head to me then pulled my body to hers, and kissed me so fiercely this time. Her lips touched mine again, then her tongue stroked mine. We both groaned and pulled and pulled at one another as we kissed.</p> <p></p> <p>The kiss was so good that I could not say a word, no wonder I can feel his body moving with hers as I kissed his neck. I wanted to take him from her again, this time with him in my arms.</p> <p></p> <p>And then I could not see or feel any of the faces I had ever ever seen in my life, but I was able to recognize all three of them, and it was the way they had kissed each other with their eyes, as though they were lovers of the other, lovers and friends.</p> <p></p> <p>Then, looking down at them once again as they kissed one another, she kissed his lips to mine as she held her lips to mine. As their heads were locked in their kiss her hand grabbed his face and pulled them into hers, and she kissed him deep and full, as though she could swallow him whole.</p> <p></p> <p>He turned his head, looking back up at me. "I do." His voice said. I could not meet his gaze.</p> <p></p> <p>Mom pulled back with another kiss I could feel on his lips.</p> <p></p> <p>I felt as it said to us what we wanted so urgently, so deeply. I kissed him again, and felt her hands on my shoulder.</p> <p>"Take him inside now." she whispered.</p> <p></p> <p>Mom pulled away from Tommy then and looked down at him.
