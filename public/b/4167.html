You will understand that everything is going to be soooo worth it, and you will find that you want it bad. Please try to take it slow.</p> <p>Love</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Chapter 2</p> <p>At 2 a.m. I picked up my phone, and sent a text message without saying what I was doing.</p> <p>"I've been looking forward to this evening," typed JW.</p> <p>When I received the message, I almost said goodbye to her, but I felt a little guilty about what I was doing and how I was being used and abused by another woman.</p> <p>Then I thought, Damn, I need to have this conversation as soon as possible; I am an emotional wreck at this point. I'm on my period, and you have been acting as if that is something you would like to do, but not do. Maybe I will be forced to do something.</p> <p>I got out of bed, and put on the night gown I had in my gym bag, and then pulled on a pair of white panties.</p> <p>I decided to put on the white underwear so my panties would be alluring and sexy. I pulled on the new pair of white socks and the shoes, and then looked in the mirror. I felt so hot and horny, and it would be impossible not to touch myself. I was wearing the white shirt now, the sleeves rolled up to my hands, and a white cotton bra to hold my breasts and nipples against the blouse. I put on a pair of black leather flip flop sandals, and then put on my white silk robe, which hung down around my ankles, just about my knees.</p> <p>At the door, I got the mail and answered it.</p> <p>I went to walk, but heard a sharp bark followed by a slap. As I was putting the paper in the mail, I saw JW. coming out of the kitchen. She stood with her arms crossed, then she stepped forward.</p> <p>"Hi, Mrs. J. "</p> <p>I froze, my heart sinking at the same time.</p> <p>I heard a slight scuffling, and saw that she was pulling the dog out of the garage. I was so glad to see her now.</p> <p>"My name is J. I'd like to ask you something. "</p> <p>"Whatever you have to say!"</p> <p>She had an evil eye on her, and she seemed to be sizing me up.</p> <p>"First of all, I'd like to tell you that although I have never had my husband with me I did date a couple, but that happened once, and I was really surprised by the sex. I mean, I've never done it with anyone! It was a boy, and I really liked it, but I had to do it with the wrong guy, and I did it just so it felt right. If that makes sense, good for your relationship. "</p> <p>My heart was racing and tears were welling up in my eyes. I tried to gather my thoughts in my mind, but my eyes did not respond.</p> <p>"I'm not asking you to say anything. Now, please come in."</p> <p>As she entered the house, I could not keep from trembling; she looked so much the other woman the way J. stood, and seemed so feminine, like Janey's friend.</p> <p>"J, let's have some coffee, then you and Mandy can talk about what you have been doing this evening. "</p> <p>She sat down across from me, and just gave me an appraising look.</p> <p>I am such a sucker.</p> <p>"When was the last time you were in town?"</p> <p>She took a big sip of her coffee.</p> <p>"About a month ago. You have missed me terribly. I haven't even been out of the office before, and I had to get back. You are so much fun to talk to, so much fun, I just can't stop thinking about you...</p> <p>The way you look!</p> <p>"You're so beautiful! You look incredible!</p> <p>"No problem. We'll go to your house on Sunday evening? I love to take a bath and run a bath, and I have been out with lots of friends. It's no problem to make it to the bath, it's only a couple of blocks from here."</p> <p>We sat in silence for a minute, then, "We'll be in your bedroom, where will we change and take a nap, and we can talk about everything."</p> <p>I really didn't want to talk about it, but I agreed.</p> <p>As we walked back to her house, I thought it best to give her a heads up before I brought it upâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
