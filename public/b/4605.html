There wasn't any fear or anger in her or in her friend's eyes, but there was a glint to her expression and in her eyes it was hard for them to be more than just friends. It was a mixture of a mix for her. He saw her eyes move back and forth but she seemed to ignore what he was just about to do with the other woman, "I'm not a prostitute. I'm a man..."</p> <p>This time the man's cock twitched and he held his breath as the woman began to move. She closed her eyes tight as the woman rubbed her back side and began to move her hips. He felt his cock respond and begin to feel it as it swelled more. He watched as the woman began to take steps backwards. His eyes were fixed on her crotch. She was beautiful even in that white shirt.</p> <p>The woman turned her head to look at him. He was suddenly overcome with desire for her. She knew what came next as she pulled the shirt down. He could see the outline of her breasts and the outline of her areolas peeking over. He saw their shape and the rise of her breasts.</p> <p>The woman pulled the shirt back up. "Well, well, what exactly did you have in mind?"</p> <p>The man was not sure what he actually wanted. This woman was hot and everything he wanted to do to her was going to come to him. He had no idea if he wanted anything else to do but try to get her off.</p> <p>"I don't think I will be able to please you."</p> <p>The woman stood up. "What will she do?"</p> <p>"How should I know?" The woman shrugged off the shirt.</p> <p>The man could only stare at the woman as she undid the button of her skirt. The man's eyes were drawn to her legs as she stepped forward. He had to fight back the desire to touch her.</p> <p>"I don't know."</p> <p>The woman pulled her skirt off. He could plainly see the panties, a thin white lace in stark contrast to her tanned legs. "Why don't you come over here, get on your knees, and kiss me?"</p> <p>"I..." She trailed into her hands.</p> <p>The man moved toward her and could not believe his luck. His mouth watered as he reached out to touch her. He had to pull back. He couldn't. No words were necessary.</p> <p>"No," she said. "I don't... I can't. But, you do."</p> <p>"But?"</p> <p>"I could have you... I could..." She pulled her feet out of her shoes. "I would suck you off and you could eat me... and then come over here and take me back to my hotel and... we would go out again...."</p> <p>"No, my friends, I don't."</p> <p>"Oh?" She looked at him again. "What do you want then, my friend?" This time her eyes were pleading with him.</p> <p>The man watched as he took charge of her. "I want... that... that..." He felt his cock jerk when he realized she wanted to be fucked.</p> <p>"Come over here. Kneel before me and kiss my thighs and your face will do."</p> <p>"I... I don't..."</p> <p>"Come over here, my friend. I will not be in a rush. You have to be here somewhere." His hands were trembling. "Come on, come on, you can wait. Here we are. Come on..."</p> <p>Without thinking, he moved.</p> <p>He was on his knees before the woman. Her body was exposed to his gaze as she was bent over the sink. He could see just the beginning of the outline of her pussy lips. He could even see the glistening of her wetness on the insides of her thighs.</p> <p>He took a breath. The scent of her had him feeling alive. He leaned forward. He took her legs and lifted them over his shoulders. He looked at the woman now kneeling naked before him.</p> <p>She had no idea what she was doing. She was enjoying it. His cock stiffened as he looked at the woman's face. From the way her hair fell on her shoulders, he could faintly smell her sweat and juices. He ran his fingers from her neck down her front and ran his hand over her chest. She was smooth. He saw the small amount of wetness he had left on her legs and knew exactly where he was heading.</p> <p>Once he reached her breasts, he slid the material of her shirt aside exposing her hardened nipples. He rubbed his face against them and felt himself get wet. He ran his lips along the sides of them.</p> <p>The woman's skin was soft and smooth. He kissed her nipples as his fingers traced the outline of her pussy lips.</p> <p>Suddenlyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
