A guy was driving it and his driver was waving as he drove back up. I knew she knew he was going to come back too. I was going to call it to happen; it had a mind of its own right now.</p> <p>I was so hot I had to have my fingers back, my pussy was aching; I needed relief. I moved my arm to the back of the couch, spread my thighs and spread my lips. The car had stopped, but I had to get closer – no moving in that direction. I kept rubbing my pussy, I was so hot it would feel like fireworks.</p> <p>I moved my finger to my opening – oh did it feel good; no man had ever gone near this much pleasure before. I slid two of my fingers in. I couldn't see, all I wanted to do was slide my fingers slowly in and out. I was so wet it felt like a hot, slippery glove.</p> <p>I slid my fingers slowly in and out faster. I knew when I was close, I was so close. I wanted to cum with her, to be with her – to be as far in her as she was.</p> <p>My orgasm crashed and raged against my fingers and I held my breath. It was a perfect moment, her legs spread wide, her eyes were fixed on my fingers deep in her pussy and the look of pleasure on hers was so hot! How could she ever let me go so far? That thought made my heart race again. It was so very, very wrong.</p> <p>I looked at the car. The driver was approaching – it was too late; it was too late.</p> <p>Her legs were wide and they were quivering. Her eyes were glued on my fingers as I finger fucked her and I could swear I heard her moaning.</p> <p>She could see me looking at her, watching as it happened, and she had one leg up on the couch leg. She was breathing fast. I saw her fingers in her pussy as she started to rub herself.</p> <p>"I want it." she said. The look in her eyes said so.</p> <p>She was right on the edge. I couldn't stop.</p> <p>I moved on the couch and got on my knees in front of her. The look in her eyes was amazing. Her arms were twitching around her. Her back was arched, her mouth wide open and her fingers rubbed her clit furiously.</p> <p>I wanted to cum, I wanted to make love to her and make her cum with me.</p> <p>I was so horny I could barely stand it.</p> <p>I started kissing her lips and her eyes closed. She responded every time I kissed her.</p> <p>She opened her eyes and looked up at me – she was panting – she had another orgasm. I kept kissing her lips, and then her chin, then her nose, my hand was still on her other thigh. Her breathing was labored. I had a look of happiness in her eyes – I loved her.</p> <p>Slowly, I started to get up. Her legs were still quivering, her nipples were hard and I could feel her pussy was wet, warm, wonderful. She was my mother and had lost something so long ago.</p> <p>I got up, walked to her and kissed her mouth with all the passion I could muster. I held her tight and started to unbutton her blouse. She wasn't resisting at all. As I worked on her buttons, she moaned and threw her arms around me and pulled me tight.</p> <p>She was breathing hard again.</p> <p>I knew this was wrong but it felt so, so right. She was so special. I wondered if she loved me that much.</p> <p>As I removed her jacket, her blouse was open. She was wearing a pink bra with pink trim. The thin strip of material kept her nipples from showing and her white lace panties had seen better days before, but they were perfect. Her breasts filled the cups beautifully, the nipples were as beautiful as mine.</p> <p>The sight of her wearing nothing but socks and heels made me want to rip them off right here and fuck her right there on the couch. It was too wrong. What was wrong with her?</p> <p>My hand reached behind her and I pulled her panties down. They were so wet; I felt the puddle of her juices in them. My fingers just barely grazed her lips. I was so wet! I needed to have her. I wanted to be her.</p> <p>She was still trembling. As I pushed her panties down, she leaned forward, she could watch me as my face buried in her pussy. My mouth found her lips and I licked them greedily.</p> <p>She grabbed my hair and pulled me in.
