Of course since you have a little time to enjoy it, you might want to take care of yourself before too long."</p> <p>"What do we do, then? You want to fuck me?"</p> <p>"That's easy. I'm not a very good lover. I've not been with other females. I've never been with any one."</p> <p>"No problem, John."</p> <p>"The moment I left there," John said as he stood up, "let me buy you a drink, just to help with the awkwardness. You can talk right here so you don't worry."</p> <p>He handed me the beer and sat down across from my wife. She leaned against the far corner of the sofa, but gave no outward sign of interest.</p> <p>"Are you happy?" He asked her.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," was all I could get out. In fact, I was a little relieved the moment we had the conversation over.</p> <p>"What about you, Jane?"</p> <p>"Don't worry. I got enough sexual experience with you tonight. You're a lot hotter than you were the first time."</p> <p>"Thanks, but only if you get to fuck me some, too."</p> <p>"Okay." I sat down again to watch the video.</p> <p>Jane said, "I think John has made a mess of it."</p> <p>"He has. He's in one of his moods now. But I'll save that for when my partner is fucking me. And since I can't wait for you to fuck me with the strap-on, he can do it now. I'm sure he will be satisfied with me getting it on with you."</p> <p>"I'll be with you. He'll have to wait and watch this video."</p> <p>"Okay." I said as I put the disc away, put the camera back in my pocket and headed home for more fun.</p> <p>The next afternoon, after an exhaustive dinner for all of us, Jane got home after her afternoon of work. I was sitting on the sofa in his living room watching a video. As she entered the room, I got up and took a seat.</p> <p>"Here!" I said as I handed her an envelope. "For the last time, I'm here with you, and I'm on my way out of here to buy you another drink. And I'm leaving before you call me, either to go home or buy me some wine. So call me before you go home. I'll pick you up in the morning."</p> <p>I walked out to the kitchen as he stood there in front of me with two steaming mugs of wine. It's a large refrigerator on our front porch. It also has a bathroom off it. I handed our three-person couch cushion to Jane.</p> <p>"I'm happy to have you as a partner," I told her as I took her in my arms and gave her a big hug. I kissed her for a long time and then released her. I smiled at her as I saw her blush a little. Heading from my kitchen to our lounge, I went to help my wife, and asked her if she was ready. I heard a gasp at the sound of her voice and I went to see what was wrong. She looked over at me when she saw me.</p> <p>"Are you okay with John?"</p> <p>"That's okay. I'd like to watch a little." I said as I opened two wine glasses.</p> <p>I watched for a minute as John and I talked. Eventually, he got up and sat next to her on the loveseat. She leaned over, and kissed him with a passion I hadn't seen in him before. He looked at me and said in a teasing voice, "This is the first kiss you've ever given me." He kissed her again and she did the same.</p> <p>Jane broke the embrace and sat up. "I want you to watch this."</p> <p>She put some music on to the stereo and turned it on low. We both leaned forward toward Jane's mouth to watch the video, and I held two of her hands behind her back, holding them to the back of her head. I felt her fingers slowly unfasten the zipper at the back of my slacks. I felt her hands touch my hardon as she undid my pants. As I pulled away from her, she reached out, unzipped my pants, and took my rock-hard erection into her warm hands.</p> <p>Jane held on for the film and kept turning the stereo off.</p> <p>"I want to get you ready for it. I want to make love to you." John was talking to her over her sexy body.
