Let's get ready. We're going to make some sandwiches so the girls are going to be starving." He started helping her undress, taking time and watching the girls eat while she finished taking off her top and shorts. He could tell that she was getting excited, knowing that even though it was a bit early in the day, she had not lost her confidence. The girls had no problem with being completely nude, even if they were only 5 minutes out of the house. They started getting out of their clothes and sitting at the dining room table. The girls were still wearing their top and shorts, and each girl did look better. The girls had their hair down, including on their heads and shoulders. The girls each had a small tattoo of a rose, which they each had taken off for a different artist. Each girl had a similar ring on her finger, which they had added as a special symbol of ownership. Amber wore the ring with a gold chain around it and Amber had a golden star around her neck. She was a bit disappointed that they hadn't gotten into a big discussion about marriage, but then, they would look like a couple. Amber was the one who had just had a small ceremony and they were going to a big party later that night, so it was a no-brainer. The girls each sat down with a small sandwich and ate, and then each girl looked over at their boyfriends. They were all just staring at each other, each trying to ignore the small talk they were having. It was just about 10 minutes before they finished, and finally it was over.</p> <p>"Ok, so let's see how many of you can say yes to, how many times, what's next. Amber and I are going to buy some of 'em. I'll buy something nice for her, and I'll pick up my food and go home. If you're not busy during the rest of the week, I will pick up yours. If we want to finish dinner and have dessert, we can start on that. How does your boyfriend think you two will do that?"</p> <p>"We'll watch the menu," she said before leaning over the table and asking.</p> <p>"Okay. Go ahead."</p> <p>The girls were eating in silence.</p> <p>As the girls finally caught their breath, the three went to their boyfriend's room to change.</p> <p>Amber and John picked up their sandwiches and followed suit to the large kitchen.</p> <p>"Amber?"</p> <p>"Yes?"</p> <p>"Do you want me to order for you?"</p> <p>Amber grinned and leaned over the counter.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Good."</p> <p>"Good, John was telling me about where he can pick on her. When we get done buying, he will give you a chance, and can pick on her without being asked. What do you think?"</p> <p>"Really? That sounds pretty good."</p> <p>"Ok, then lets go."</p> <p>They sat together across from each other, eating their sandwiches as Amber and John talked about where they were going to get their 'special' things. They would get their special things when it was time to go back to their normal life. They were both happy about having a positive effect on each other. Their boyfriends had a positive reaction to the subject, when their boyfriends were talking about sex and Amber was smiling at him with that same smile. Then it hit her. Amber had been talking about her sex life for a while.</p> <p>"You're excited?" she asked, referring to the topic of sex.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Oh... yeah. So you want to see what happens?"</p> <p>"Oh, oh... yeah." Amber laughed nervously. "That's the point John. We had a conversation once when he was describing his sexual experiences."</p> <p>"Yeah? That was you."</p> <p>"Yeah, and it was kind of hot."</p> <p>"I'm still not done."</p> <p>"No, no, of course not."</p> <p>"But..."</p> <p>"No, buts. So, you said that you had something planned. Are you really going to show Amber?"</p> <p>"No, of course I'm not. I don't know what I'm going to do but if you want to show her how to make a pussy cum, do it."</p> <p>"I don't know. She said that she has a pretty neat collection." Amber laughed. "I've only opened up her closet in the past because I bought her lingerie."</p> <p>"Wow. Oh, I have a nice assortment. She's really nice."</p> <p>"Well, she thinks so too. She liked the lingerie I bought for her."</p> <p>"Wow, I like that."</p> <p>"Yes, and she likes it." John laughed.</p> <p>"Thank you. I love it when you say thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
