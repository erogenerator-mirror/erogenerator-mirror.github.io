It read 4:35 AM.</p> <p>My cock started swelling in my khakis.</p> <p>"You'll be gone by that time. I need a hot bath. Go and take a hot bath and get yourself ready for work. Go take your morning shower and then you can dry." She smiled a mischievous smile at me.</p> <p>"Ok...."</p> <p>I knew I was in deep shit. I had to find a way to get her out of there. I needed to have her home. I didn't need a hard dick shoved against my pants. I wanted to have her home. Not just my cock, my wife. But I could live with that. But I had an option. As I had long ago realized, my options were limited. I was with Lisa. I loved her. I loved the feelings that she and I shared in a mutual respect. This was only as big as it might be. That was what marriage was about.</p> <p>She had no idea.</p> <p>I thought about it a few moments then turned back to my work. My mind was in a whirl and I had to get her out of here. I had the job. I had the company. I had her. I was in business and she could do it. But that's how my life had turned out.</p> <p>She was not going to be home for a week!</p> <p>My mind had been spinning. I was worried.</p> <p>My job was now a dead heat. I had to find an excuse. I had to find a way to get her out of the house.</p> <p>I was going to have to break the ice. It was no use. I had to find out what my options were. Find out if we needed the place more or more. The next step would be easy.</p> <p>I got up from my desk, gathered my thoughts and headed to my office again. I wasn't going to make any money at all. This job was definitely mine to keep. I wasn't going to take some vacation time. I didn't expect her home for a week. This was the end of a business trip.</p> <p>I was alone in my office this time. I had to find her.</p> <p>I turned on my cell and tried to reach her. I was on her way to a meeting this morning. I had to get her home. I had lost her. I had to find her. I had to have sex with her.</p> <p>I took a quick glance in my office mirror and saw that my hand was shaking.</p> <p>"Honey...please!"</p> <p>I felt a wave of disappointment course through me.</p> <p>"I can't believe you made it through this. If you've got no job....I'm going!" Now it was my turn to take a glance in the mirror.</p> <p>"Honey...I have an apartment!" Was the reply, I got back to my office.</p> <p>The apartment was in the back of a high rise building that was located on the second floor. It was located on an exclusive side of the city and was a great place for business. The building owner had taken a great interest in the building and was very impressed with my work ethic and my ability to perform in business. He also enjoyed my working with the new building manager.</p> <p>I closed my eyes and pictured her in a different part of the building this time. The building was in a different time. This time she was there. This was the place I needed. She was here.</p> <p>I had to find her. I had to get her home. I had to make love to her.</p> <p>The drive to my place was long and I wasn't very excited about getting the place to myself for the next week. But I was in a hurry because I was going to find my wife. I knew we would get an opportunity to get her home for a couple of days. That should have been the end of our marriage, I thought. That and a few more weeks where I could continue my relationship with Lisa.</p> <p>Before I left for my office there was a message on my answering card. I was surprised that it was from her. It could be from a number or several people.</p> <p>"How did you find me?" she answered. A note on the other side of the card read, "I met the woman at a restaurant."</p> <p>I smiled at the name that came from my wife's neck. I was surprised she was wearing a business suit. My breath caught in my throat.</p> <p>"You look fantastic!" I stammered. I had to go. I had to get my wife out of here. Then my thoughts went from one business meeting to two or three and I was so stressed that I had little choice.
