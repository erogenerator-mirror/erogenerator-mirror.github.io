It was then that she began to tell him of what happened in the last few weeks at camp. There was that one day that he came to the camp. She had been so upset and upset when he had not been home to help her with her shopping.</p> <p>After that day had ended he came to her the next evening and she had told him of all the things she had gone through over the last few weeks. He had been taken and thrown out like a child and had had to leave. It had been when she had been crying that he had told her to go back next year and have a baby, to save face for another woman. He had then taken her out of the country in the back of his truck, taken her back to the hotel and taken her in every way of the human being as he had done.</p> <p>He had brought her there for several hours, had her undress but she never went out. He had taken her on those hard things and even had sex with her and all things had been a lie. The worst part was being forced to be with a woman and it had been a lie anyway. On the next day he brought her home and she had tried for a long time to tell him he had made a mistake and that she couldn't be with him anymore. It was then that he had finally taken control of her.</p> <p>When he had walked over and set her down on his bed to sleep he had gone back in and made love to her. There had been no resistance but when he started to fuck her she had begun to move under him. After a long time and an unknown number of orgasms she felt like a woman possessed. She was wet like she had been when they had fucked. Not only did she move under him but it felt as if he was fucking her every bit as hard as he had fucked her. The only thing that was that it was like she was in his arms again. She wanted to feel him as only he could.</p> <p>He had made her come several times, she had screamed them and she couldn't help it. It went on for ages until she had to take a piss because she was on fire and she needed to get off. Her legs had been locked around his hips and he had had hold of her pussy with his mouth and one hand. It had not just been a piss it was to her to do that with. She had tried to get him to release her but he had told her not to move. He would cum inside of her and she was going to feel as one person once again.</p> <p>As she came he had told her that his cock was bigger, stronger than ever or it could possibly fit as it had to be within her. She was going to be fucked by this huge cock. Finally he had taken her and given it a few strokes before she had exploded. He had been very rough and she had told him that it was only fair for her to feel as one person. He was not being fair. He could get the use of her and his cock could still get them both off together. She needed to be fucked and he wanted to feel as one. Now it was his turn to be rough.</p> <p>As she had passed out on the bed he had stripped off the rest of his clothes and climbed on top of her. She was so excited she didn't know what to expect. He had grabbed her by the hips and was pumping into her with what seemed like a huge animalistic animalistic force for what seemed like a very long time. It had been more than she could take and she had cum before he had finished cumming.</p> <p>He had kept on fucking her, as he had wanted to for some time now. Finally he had to cum, he wasn't ready to let her go but the cum was coming and she was screaming as her body shook. His cock had stayed hard and he was getting ready to take her again. He couldn't wait any longer, he had to find out what this woman wanted. He took off and took his cock in one hand and placed the head against her clit and slowly began to rub it.</p> <p>"Fuck me." She could hardly manage to say it,</p> <p>"Fuck me hard." She had never been so excited. He was slow and deliberate, he knew she would feel every moment of it. He wanted to be sure of himself. It had been almost twenty-five years since he made love to his wife. When he felt her shaking and cumming he knew that she was ready to come. He needed to get that out of his mind. This was an event that was going to have been one to remember. He knew she was going to let him do it again soon but she didn't want that.</p> <p>He would love to continue to do this but she knew that would be all. In fact she really likedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
