I took a tentative suck before my mouth was opened wide by her and it took all my willpower to not to gag. I kissed and licked her soft skin all over as far from her mouth as it would go. She sighed her contentment.</p> <p>I moved my tongue slowly over her stomach and over her pubic hair. She was neatly trimmed and with her fingers she pulled it aside. "Mmm, that's a start," she murmured with a smile.</p> <p>"I like it," I said as I raised her legs, slid my body up so that I can lick her cunt. "Can you taste yourself on me?" I asked.</p> <p>She shook her head, "Not that, you'll ruin me."</p> <p>"Not quite yet," I assured her. I moved up her body, taking my cock in hand, sliding it along her slit. She lifted herself to me, taking me in hand; she guided me towards her opening. I moved in, pressing on her.</p> <p>She pushed herself against my cock. She moved slightly against it.</p> <p>"Harder, Jack," she said in her sexiest voice. I thrust into her. I saw her tits bobbing as she rode me back. I felt myself pushing harder into her. She was wet and warm and oh so beautiful.</p> <p>I held her to me.</p> <p>"Ohhhh, Jack. Oh, that's wonderful. Oh I love you so much" she said.</p> <p>She looked at me. Then she pushed back into me, making me hold her hips in position.</p> <p>"Jack," she said a little louder.</p> <p>I kissed her neck. "I love you like that," I said as I kissed her.</p> <p>She turned her face to me kissing me and said, "I love you like this too."</p> <p>I kissed her again pulling her close to me. "I love being loved like that," I said.</p> <p>"Oh," she said, her eyes still closed at last.</p> <p>I let her go. She leaned down to kiss me. I could feel her hot little body against mine. I leaned back pulling her close to me. She could feel my erect cock pressing against her belly.</p> <p>"I never felt like that, I never felt like that."</p> <p>"I hope yours feels right like this," I told her.</p> <p>I could feel her trembling at my words. "Yes that feels good, so good," she said sounding like a frightened little girl.</p> <p>"That's what I'll show you, it's beautiful," I whispered in her ear and gave it a little tug.</p> <p>We lay there for a little while. I kissed her neck.</p> <p>She had a look I hadn't felt since I was in her body. "I don't know if I'm ready for this yet," she said as she moved away from me pulling her hand back to her neck.</p> <p>"I'll take care of it," I told her as I moved up to the head of the bed on my side.</p> <p>I felt her hands on me, feeling me, trying to feel just how ready she was. She wanted to know every nuance. This night I had already opened a new chapter in my life, one of my greatest pleasures. I lay beside her feeling her small frame wrapped around me. She had no idea how close I really was, as tight as we both were, but when we kissed I could actually feel her body as it seemed to have a mind of its own.</p> <p>She was not the first woman to take the lead, I told her with a smile.</p> <p>"Honey, we can't start now can we?" she asked with a little laugh that left her eyes sparkling.</p> <p>"We'll see," I assured her.</p> <p>We lay there just enjoying the feeling of each other's touch. My hands felt her flesh. Mine did not.</p> <p>She was the first woman to ever touch my cock I had ever felt.</p> <p>"My God it's gorgeous," she said in awe. "Thank you."</p> <p>"My pleasure."</p> <p>Her hands were on me now I felt them running all around my cock feeling it hardening and making it a lot more sensitive to her touch. I leaned right on her so that I could feel even her breasts as I kissed her neck while she fondled me.</p> <p>Kneeling on the bed I took her right nipple in my mouth and sucked on it. I put it in my mouth taking the little nub in with my lips.</p> <p>Her body trembled on the bed pressing against me.</p> <p>I felt her body quiver as her thighs opened. She pressed her hips down.</p> <p>It took all my restraint not to move.
