There was no way I could resist another touch. I had to have more of him inside me. He pressed forward into me as he moved off the bed. I reached down between my legs and started rubbing my clit with my fingers, enjoying the contact. He took hold of my breast once more, and started kissing and biting each nipple. My pussy was on fire and wanting more.</p> <p>He turned the water on, turned it down and pulled me to him. He started to rub my clit with his thumb and finger, gently at first, then building to a pace he had never before held in. He kept his hand steady on my clit, running his finger up the length of my slit, feeling the little nub under the tip. I started to shiver, my body on fire. As I started to reach the peak of my climax, I pulled his head down to mine, and kissed him. He kissed me a little harder, and I tasted myself on his mouth.</p> <p>"I want to taste you."</p> <p>He slowly started to remove me from bed. He moved the sheets of our bed aside, then he pulled me down on it. He turned me on my back and entered me again. The heat of his body between my legs was driving me to new heights. He moved slowly, and as he moved back and forth, he pulled me tighter to him. I could feel his heart-shaped pelvis, and he pulled the sheet off us. He pulled out again and again, and I felt his breath on my naked flesh.</p> <p>He started moving faster and harder, his pelvis slamming against mine, driving his cock deep into me. He kissed my neck, my mouth, as he kept moving slowly and surely. I tried to tell him, but I was scared. I was scared he would come too fast or hurt me. I started to squirm and he grabbed my wrists and held them firmly above my head. He moved back so our hips would be in contact and he still held on to my wrists. He started to move his hips faster and deeper and I started to orgasm as well. I shuddered with orgasm, my orgasm almost more than I could stand as I came over and over.</p> <p>"Please," I said breathlessly, "I can't take any more!"</p> <p>I couldn't have stopped him if I'd wanted to.</p> <p>As I started to come down from one orgasm, he started to move in hard and fast again. I felt another one coming. He gripped my waist harder and started to pound me so hard, I knew I was going to explode again myself.</p> <p>"That's it, baby, cum with me."</p> <p>"I have to come!" I begged.</p> <p>I felt the bed shaking as my muscles clamped his cock and I orgasmed with him, feeling waves of warmth as they started to build and build and build deep inside of me, until finally their orgasms subsided. He collapsed on me and kissed me.</p> <p>"That was amazing. I love you so much."</p> <p>"I love you too," I responded.</p> <p>He stroked my wet body, enjoying the softness of the curves surrounding him.</p> <p>"I love how strong you are, lover. No one can give you more."</p> <p>I reached up and cupped his face and he kissed me, and held me. I started to kiss his neck, and trail my tongue down to his chest, where I found his nipples. I teased them, licking them and kissing them as I did so. He ran his fingers through my hair and I felt his cock twitch. I smiled and took his cock in my hand and stroked him. I took him in my mouth and he groaned softly in pleasure. The sensation of the head of his cock against the top of my tongue, I closed my mouth and went to work.</p> <p>I slowly slid his cock down to the back of my throat. As I slid it out, I took his balls in my hand and rubbed them gently with my thumb. As I closed my lips gently around it, he felt the rush of electricity run up my body. He pushed me down to my back, and moved his cock to the entrance of my pussy. I felt him slide in slowly and I cried out. His head brushed my sensitive clit and it set me over the edge.</p> <p>"Oh, Yes!" I cried again and he started to thrust into my body faster and faster. His hands were on my breasts again, and I couldn't help but squeeze my thighs together in response.</p> <p>"Oh, You're so wet, my sweet," he said as we were joined again between our bodies.</p> <p>We kissed again, this time he pushed his lips to mine and gently caressed them. I ran my hand through his brown hairâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
