She tossed the garment onto the sofa and stood.</p> <p>"But that would have to be all you were wearing, right?" he asked, taking her hand.</p> <p>She was just too lovely to resist. "It would be fun, of course," she cooed as their hands roamed to each other's backsides, "but I'd probably need some help with my makeup."</p> <p>He grinned and then slid his hands along her thighs and under the hem of her dress. "You don't have to do that. This is the first of many weekends for us both to be free."</p> <p>"Thank you," she smiled and leaned into his embrace, "I think this should do nicely."</p> <p>He kissed her nose and her cheek and then pulled away. "Now, you're gonna have to make me cum first." He pulled her down onto the sofa and started kissing her breasts and nipples. He felt her nipples grow hard in his hands and his tongue flickered across them. When he finally released her nipples he sucked them into his mouth—an exciting sensation. It occurred to him that this was the first time he'd had them, but he couldn't find the courage to ask.</p> <p>"Oh, please."</p> <p>Her hand slid over his head and settled into his hair. "Okay. I want you to do something special for me," she said softly.</p> <p>"What kind of special is that?"</p> <p>"Something you're gonna love. Like this. When you feel it, you'll know. When I get it, you'll understand, too." His mouth moved to her other nipple and she gasped when his head started to nuzzle it.</p> <p>"This is fun. Really fun." He felt both of them melt into one another and he could only hope he wouldn't be too far gone this first time.</p> <p>He sucked the nipple into his mouth. It made her shudder and she pushed her breast against him. The pleasure was so much that he could hardly get his tongue out of the way between his teeth. He sucked lightly and then moved on.</p> <p>His hand went back to her other breast and he held her firm. Her hand wrapped around his and they pulled him into him. She felt light and wonderful. He liked how she held him like that.</p> <p>Her knees opened and she kicked one leg over his. When he pushed between them she pushed with the rest of her hips and it just slid into he. Her pussy felt like it had never felt before. His cock slid into her and then pulled back out, glistening wetly.</p> <p>With her heels on his buttocks she felt full. It had always been the case with a woman. It was so very erotic for him and so very erotic that it was almost overwhelming. His cock rubbed against her flesh. It drove him crazy.</p> <p>"Yes," she gasped as he filled her channel, "do it."</p> <p>He was lost in the sensations. She felt so warm, so soft and so sexy. He wanted to make her cum, to make her orgasm last just a little longer. But he was beyond that. He just wanted to keep going for the whole of their weekend. But he couldn't find the courage to ask her.</p> <p>"What's your name again?"</p> <p>"Patrica," she giggled and squeezed his cock, "it's so hot in here."</p> <p>"Don't forget my real name," he told her.</p> <p>"You know mine, just in case," she laughed.</p> <p>He could hardly believe how sexy she was, just lying there on their sofa, in her frilly nightdress under the mistletoe. The smell of her was intoxicating, not at all the scents of the other women in his life.</p> <p>They had been doing that for a while, although it had never gone too far. This was the first weekend they could do it together. It was a chance of just being able to give each other a little sexual satisfaction.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, Patrica," he said as he pulled her down to lie beside him.</p> <p>She kissed his fingers and then his face and then moved to his lips once again. "No, I wanted to talk to you about this," she said.</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"It's been an awesome week, isn't it," she said, looking up at him over her shoulder.</p> <p>"I'm proud of you," he said smiling.</p> <p>"Well, I'm happy about that. We'll talk again soon about that."</p> <p>"Good. You better."</p> <p>"What do I do if I get a hard-on?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don't know—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
