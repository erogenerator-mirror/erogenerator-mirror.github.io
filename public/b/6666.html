I was on my knees, leaning her over my chair, my fingers running through her long hair, my tongue teasing the tip of her clit and pulling her to stop her breath. I felt the orgasm start and couldn't hold it back any longer and I began to cum deep in her pussy, filling her with my cum.</p> <p>"What are you doing down there?" she asked as my cock began to deflate and slip out of her pussy.</p> <p>I looked up at her. "Oh, nothing. I was just..." I fell silent again. I didn't want to say anything again, but somehow I did want to say something about what I just experienced. And that would be telling her how much I loved what just happened.</p> <p>"Yes," I whispered hoarsely into her neck. I couldn't help myself. I wanted to tell her how much I loved what I just saw and heard. But she was still sitting in my lap, and so I took control and pulled her to me and kissed her deeply until the kiss ended.</p> <p>The kiss just continued, but I could tell that this kiss was different for us. As it came, she reached up to take my hand in hers, which she held tightly in her palm. "You weren't kidding about wanting to see me again," she said.</p> <p>"Well I'm not. I was lying." And in one sudden movement, she pulled me back, spun me around and had me bend over the chair, pushing me back. She took off her shoes and then dropped her feet to the ground and unzipped her dress. She pushed it down to her hips, stepped out of her heels and it fell to the floor. She stepped back out of a pair of black panties then turned her back to me, turned her hips and slid the panties to the side as she grabbed a piece of rope from the wall beside the chair that I was sitting in. She tied the rope around the chair arms, making them spread very wide. She had me lean across the chair, then came back to me. She tied one end of the other end of the rope to the rope around the chair behind me, then tied the other end to the rope under the chair in front of her. She moved quickly, taking her time as I felt the rope tighten and then loosen in anticipation. I could see the rope in her hands tighten as she moved, saw her hand moving towards me as she tied the other end to a rope on my back. I was now fully bound and I still couldn't move so I just stood where I was waiting, trying to take something else from her. I didn't want to tell her anything though and didn't want to be rude or anything. It was time to take back what I had just seen and to be myself.</p> <p>I heard her footsteps and knew she had come back to me and when she looked around the room I saw that she was standing beside me, looking at her watch. "Do you want to come?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yes," I said just before she placed the blindfold over my eyes. "Will you untie me?" I asked, hoping I wasn't dreaming.</p> <p>Before I could answer, she said "yes, I trust you very much." And she went over to stand behind me again. She pulled my hands behind my back and tied them together with the rope. Then with both hands she pulled me towards her and put the rope around my wrists, then tightened the rope so the rope had it's knotting straight down. With her hands tied above my head I couldn't move them very much.</p> <p>"Have you ever been with any guys?" she asked, while running her hands along the front of my body. "No." I answered, "But if you're into it, let's do it." I knew the right thing to say though, and she smiled and nodded her head in encouragement.</p> <p>We moved towards each other and she led me into the bathroom. Once in there, she told me to undress and lie on the large double sink. She walked to the counter, grabbed a razor and proceeded to trim my pubic hair. As she finished, she came back to me and said "I'll need to do this for you, since you've shaved for last, it won't take long." She then began to shave my body and shaved everything, never touching any area of me. She shaved my arms and legs, making the hair there grow as we went. It felt great. She even stopped me from shaving my chest, leaving it completely bare for now. When she finished, she finished by running the razor over and between my thighs, making sure my thighs were completely bare. "Is this what you wanted to see?" she said and looked me over again. I nodded my head and she shaved off the last two or three remaining hairs from my skin. Then she asked me if sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
