You kissed and licked along my shoulder with a contented sigh. My pussy ached for your hard cock. We continued our little game while enjoying each other’s touch. I was loving it. You pulled down the blindfold and I let the light fall on you. You smiled at me, your eyes dancing and feeling my eyes. “You like it, baby?” you asked as I pulled our clothes back on. I could see the desire in your eyes. You moved to put your arms over my shoulders. I put mine to your sides and we hugged slowly, our bodies molding to one another.</p> <p>We stopped to catch our breath and I leaned toward your ear. “I have a surprise for you.” I whispered. You grinned and rolled toward me. Your fingers began massaging my breasts through my blouse. I could already feel the swell of your erection. You pulled away from me. I slipped my blouse completely off. “Come with me….” you said to yourself. We walked arm and arm toward the bedroom. As you looked out the window, you saw me getting an evening dress out of the closet. I walked over to you with it on and sat on the edge of the bed. You reached out to remove the thong and I held it before your outstretched fingers. You laughed.</p> <p>“I do have to shave before the flight,” you said as you watched the smooth pink lips. Slowly, you started taking off your shirt and pants. I had stopped kissing you and stepped back. Your clothes slowly came off and as each article fell into a pile on the floor, your erection came at me. It was hard and throbbing. I couldn’t stop kissing it and nibbling on your balls and cock. I could feel juices trickling down my chin. The skin was so soft and smooth and yet so large. After you were completely naked, I stood and slid the thin satin robe on my shoulders. I stepped back and let it slide back covering my body. As I stepped over you, I slid the robe down my body. You couldn’t believe the sheer silkiness. You could see my shaved pussy and inner thighs. And then you realized why. The lips of my pussy were so soft and plump….</p> <p>“You don’t have to wear any clothes, honey. Just keep the robe,” I said, reaching for the belt. “Come, sit beside me.” You came out of the bedroom dressed only in your boxer shorts. “I’ll put these things away….” you said. I watched you go to make yourself comfortable, then walked over to put away our clothes. I put my hand on my shoulder and watched you get a towel off the bathroom. I went back to the other room. Soon your clothes were covered and I was lying on my side, my head against the pillow. You were leaning against the doorframe, your fingers playing with my hair. You looked at me lying there.</p> <p>“It’s my surprise.” You told me. Your eyes closed as you enjoyed your time with me. You sat up and held back your breath. “I wanted to make sure you…um….got a good night’s sleep.” You said as you ran a finger down my chest. I could feel your breath on my neck and shoulders. “I am sure you are exhausted from your work out.” You said as you pushed me up from the wall. You grabbed my wrists and quickly pushed me back to the bed. “I need to get better.”You said. “Can we go someplace….like the movies?” I asked. “Ok.” you answered as you pushed me back to my elbows. We lay together on the bed.</p> <p>“Can we do this again sometime?” You asked me looking up at me. You pulled the covers off of me and you were on your side with your back to me. I knew I couldn’t be lying with you this hard, it was probably because I was wearing the thong. We kissed slowly, my arm going around you. Then your hand slid down my chest and onto my pussy. “You still are shaved. Why didn’t my surprise start the night over?” you said as you rubbed my clit. “I knew you were wet. And, I didn’t have everything you asked.” I said. “Do you still want to be my surprise?” You asked, pressing your hand between my legs.</p> <p>“Baby, don’t get too carried away…we need to take care of all of you before we do anything else,” I whispered—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
