She had been with her for quite sometime now and felt almost sorry for those boys. She couldn't really say why because just the mention of them had brought back a painful feeling to her.</p> <p>She was so very happy. She was looking forward to all this fun, to the weekend of lovemaking, but there would be no sex, no lovemaking. How could someone else have a romantic interest in her.</p> <p>She took that feeling in her heart. She needed a boyfriend with a nice cock, no one who would go down on her. The sex would be as good, or better, as it could be in normal circumstances. It was the first time he had shown any interest in her. She decided to wait a few days before she brought him over, to see how things would go. She was sure that she hadn't brought any toys with her, but was happy to do so.</p> <p>She put the phone back to take her mind off everything.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>Sam was waiting for her. She came over wearing a long black robe tied loosely at her hips.</p> <p>"You look great. I like it. Do you mind if I watch the boys?" she asked as she sat down with him and sat in his lap.</p> <p>"Of course not. It's just you and me."</p> <p>Sam loved how he did that. His hands were already getting tired but he wanted to enjoy her body more than he had last night.</p> <p>"Have you found a friend yet?" he asked.</p> <p>"Sort of, but I'm sure I'll find one who'll want to see me get naked," she said and kissed him on the cheek.</p> <p>"I thought I might just do so," he said and kissed her back.</p> <p>She was a bit sad. So was he or was it really possible? She knew it wasn't going to happen but there was a point at which he was more than ready and even more than that. At the same time the way he would react was a bit strange. There would be no other way for them to get to know each other.</p> <p>"I've been thinking about this," she said, trying to lighten her mood somewhat, before asking again.</p> <p>"What about you?" he asked. "Not that that would be a bad thing. If we're doing it now we need to do it every chance we get. There is a lot we never get out of the way, now. I'm not complaining, mind you."</p> <p>"It's okay. As long as you're okay with it though," she said, "and can really appreciate someone going down on you."</p> <p>He looked a bit puzzled.</p> <p>"But..." he started.</p> <p>"Yes, it's fine. It's going to be our little secret. Do with me," she said and kissed him once more.</p> <p>And with that she got up and walked slowly towards her bedroom, her big ass swaying with each step. She looked back over her shoulder at him.</p> <p>"See that it's okay, Sam. I trust you completely. It's okay, sweetheart. We both know it's okay."</p> <p>Sam stood up to take his shoes off.</p> <p>"You have a nice body. I can't wait to take off my clothes. How about you?"</p> <p>"Well..." she started.</p> <p>"You're gonna love my clothes."</p> <p>Sam just stood up for a moment looking at her. She had the most beautiful naked female body he had ever had the pleasure of seeing. The nipples were erect and full, like two small little pebbles. They were pink and looked like it was going to get darker in the evening.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want to do this?" he asked.</p> <p>"I've wanted to in fact ever since I saw you last. I was always curious about your dick."</p> <p>"Well, I'm not going to be any fun for you. You can look. If you want to, it's okay with me."</p> <p>She sat back down in his lap. She took his face in her hands and kissed him, not just once, but very much. She wanted it so very bad. He was still a bit stunned, but he would have liked her just as much as she did him. Her lips tasted so good. As she kissed her husband she felt the softness of his arms around her, pulling her body closer. So close it was the whole world could feel them.</p> <p>The kiss lasted long enough for Sam to realise where they were. He couldn't feel his wife's body against his own, she was still clothed but she was wearing no panties. The feeling was electric, and Sam wanted more of it. He wanted to kiss and feel her breastsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
