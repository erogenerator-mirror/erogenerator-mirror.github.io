She's waiting for me out by the lake."</p> <p>I had no idea how far to go out by the beach, so I had decided to put some distance between us. Just as I thought I would be able to see her and talk to her on the phone without all these other people, my cell phone went off. It was my sister calling down from the park, as I didn't want to talk to any of my family about the call.</p> <p>I hurried over to the phone and put the call on hold as I felt my stomach lurch at the sound of my sister's voice.</p> <p>"Hey Baby. How was your day?"</p> <p>"It was ok. How are you?"</p> <p>She had her arm around my waist and was giving me a huge hug, which I could feel on my upper arms, and was so much shorter than me. It felt so good having her pressed up against me, and I couldn't help but wonder if I should kiss her or hug her more in return, and I think there might be one more reason why I kept taking my clothes off.</p> <p>"It was great. I've never done this before. It feels so good to me."</p> <p>Her hands were still all over me, squeezing my ass and pulling the hair right off my head, and my cock began to grow as I held her closer. It felt so good being held like that, not being able to get a single inch of myself inside of her. "You should have gone to a sex club or something."</p> <p>"Yes," she responded, trying to sound excited now. "I just couldn't wait. I was so excited that night, and every time you walked down the beach, my pussy became so wet."</p> <p>"I just couldn't stop thinking over what happened that day." I told her as I could feel her tremble in my arms. "I still could hear the noises from when you guys hit it off. Even when you were gone, they were so loud, I couldn't stop myself. You know that I don't hear a sound."</p> <p>"I know," she laughed, "and I felt like my whole body was shaking, too. I loved it!"</p> <p>I hadn't told her about listening to my dad fucking my Mom, but I didn't care, since I was glad that it was going to be good sex and not that boring boring boring boring boring boring.</p> <p>I guess I never really paid attention to my mom. She was the same age as my dad, the same age that I was when we first got here in the summer, the same age my dad was when we got here in the Fall. For some reason, the memory of our little conversation had me wanting to feel her, and I didn't want to make a big deal about it yet. Plus, I never really knew her to be anything more than just a normal middle aged woman.</p> <p>It was at that moment that I began to notice that she looked exactly like my mother. She had short blonde hair, her face was perfectly round, and her figure was just as good looking as my mother, probably because she was a lot younger looking. I felt like she had curves everywhere. She had a slight belly, and was carrying about the same size as my dad, and also had a nice pair of breasts on her. Her nipples were about a half inch long, and they looked as sexy as they always did on my mother.</p> <p>I couldn't stop staring at her body as I told her how happy and sexy she looked, and it was turning me on so much as I watched her face as she talked with mom. "Honey, that beach is so beautiful, isn't it? The water looks so inviting, isn't it?" she asked as she took a sip of her drink.</p> <p>"Yes. It's lovely!" I responded while trying to keep my eyes on her body from the side.</p> <p>"Good. It's nice to see. I am glad that my parents didn't have a problem when I moved away and moved back to my old hometown in South Florida."</p> <p>She laughed in a musical way, and then added, "Honey, this is so amazing! I mean, my parents didn't even let me get a job back there, and that's even better."</p> <p>"Thanks." I said as I reached over and took her hand in mine.</p> <p>"What do you do when you aren't on the phone with your sister?" I asked, "Do you think I should do something about my hard-on?"</p> <p>"No baby, you shouldn't do that. Mom and dad would kill me if you did that."</p> <p>"Oh, I'm sureâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
