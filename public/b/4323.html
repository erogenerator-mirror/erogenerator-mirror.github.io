My lips part and my body tingles... my body shivers as his lips touch mine. I can feel every muscle of his hand as the fingers of his free hand trail down and brush at my slit, pushing its way into my tight hole. And then, I feel the tip of his cock, a sharp and sensitive touch on my engorged clit. I groan in pleasure, and as it slides into my dripping hole his fingers begin to rub my swollen nub with the same slow circular motion.</p> <p>My face is flush with heat and my breath quickens as he plays with me... my clit is swollen and sensitive as his fingers caress it. He slides another finger along the slick wetness between my legs in time with his fingers working in my pussy. My legs begin to shake from the pressure he's building up on my clit, and I can feel my body tense against his fingers... he stops for a second, just letting me feel the tension.</p> <p>"I can't, you'll cum if you touch me, ok?" He whispers to me and continues to play with me.</p> <p>"But you have to hold me up... I want to cum and it won't be with someone on stage." I say firmly. He leans over and kisses me, and as our lips part I feel the warmth of the audience in the front of the stage as my legs begin to tremble and the warmth of him is spreading all of my sexual tension even higher.</p> <p>"I'm on stage for you. Just sit on the edge!" He stands up and I stand up as he does. He holds out a large red envelope. "That's for any trouble you need to leave." He smiles back at me and walks off stage.</p> <p>I look at the envelope and begin to read it, but suddenly he walks in front of me. "Read this!" He shouts across the room.</p> <p>"It's in your bag." I whisper as I pull out the red envelope. He smiles widely and puts his fingers to his lips.</p> <p>"It was good, wasn't it?" He says and then his eyes wander over the small pile of paper. "You can write what you want on this, there is no need for that."</p> <p>I stare at the envelope. I have to think if I can go through with this... I had my doubts about staying on stage. "Read it." I finally speak and then glance out at the audience again.</p> <p>I reach forward with my delicate fingers and grasp the envelope. "I have to see what's inside." And then with trembling voice I read aloud. "Please put the envelope down." It says.</p> <p>I pull it out of the envelope, and I hold it up in front of me as I reach back inside and pull out a card. As I read it I realize the note reads "I'm here. Please let me know any new requests for a special performance come through." It seems so simple and so easy to read, and I begin to feel nervous. My face, my body, my body is on fire, and I hope to hell this doesn't lead to the same fate again. My hands tremble as I hold the card in front of me.</p> <p>I look out across the stage and see the small crowd moving into the stage as I begin to read the note again. "You'll find it in the bag." The note read and again I begin to shake. "Read this!" My lips are already trembling, just the very thought of reading the note seems to have me on the edge of a mind-blowing orgasm. "Do you read it?" I nod as I lean forward and grasp the envelope tightly.</p> <p>"Ok, then, go ahead." He says as he opens the envelope and pulls out a single sheet of paper. "It's not all that hard to find. But I have to find you something to wear and not to touch. You had your doubts as well as your body. Go buy some something."</p> <p>I am stunned. I'm at work, but at the same time so excited. And now I can finally have my own clothes. I don't feel like I want to put them on, but the excitement of the experience has my legs trembling even more, my body shivers, and I can't wait either as I reach into the bag and pull out a sexy red bra and panties and slide them on before setting the table. I lean over the table to pull the bra up as I turn to grab my panties. The fabric is hot against my damp lips, and I feel myself becoming aroused.</p> <p>I hear him gasp as he sees his first girl in public... and then I see him come back with a chair and sit down.</p> <p>"Turn around and sit." His hand is gently on my shoulder as I turn slowly. "Spread your legs."
