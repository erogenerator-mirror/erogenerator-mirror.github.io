They had been walking a lot so he was no longer the shy shy young man. Instead of being too nervous she smiled and said, "If you were there, I'd wear what you were wearing tonight, and if you were at home, I would put on what you would wear."</p> <p>He said, "I like you more that anything, you're a nice looking couple."</p> <p>"Thank you. I'm glad I can be nice to you, it's nice to have someone as well."</p> <p>'A wonderful way to end our date, but it seems that you really are the one." He said as they walked back to the beach. As they got close to each other they kissed each other softly on the lips. Then she kissed him again as they stood on the beach again. As they slowly walked back she moved one of her hands to his belt and began to unzip his pants. He quickly pushed it off and dropped his pants and his underwear to reveal his large stiffened cock already standing tall. It was already oozing precum.</p> <p>"That's a nice hard cock." She smiled, "It's just the right size. I want to ride your prick until I'm full and then I'll suck you to several orgasm's, right here in the water" she said seductively, "right here on the beach."</p> <p>They moved to the sand where both were soon laying on their stomachs with him between her legs, both of them sucking her nipples to erectness in the moonlight. As they kissed they slowly licked the lips of her sex and sucked up and down the soft skin of her labia.</p> <p>She held his head in the warm embrace of her sex as they sucked on her breasts. He licked between the lips of her hot pussy, as his tongue slid deep inside her moist warmth. He slid his finger between the lips of her sex, as she pushed her sex towards his finger.</p> <p>She pressed her pussy into his face and his finger then pulled out as far as he could, to run around her opening, as she pulled his head tight against her. She slowly fucked his mouth and his finger with her pussy.</p> <p>"Oh God, Oh God! I'm coming!" she moaned through clenched teeth.</p> <p>As her orgasm subsided he lifted her face off his cock and kissed. "I wanted something to drink." She smiled and walked the couple a little more.</p> <p>"You have no idea how much I've wanted this for the last two weeks."</p> <p>"Yes I know." He said as he kissed her again. "God, I've missed this you are so beautiful."</p> <p>"I've missed you too, just as I've missed that sweet big cock, and your mouth." She said as she moved close to him. "God, I don't know where you found that lovely cock, your face is so sexy and your body."</p> <p>"Oh you are beautiful, but not that beautiful. Your pussy is great. You're a great lover."</p> <p>"Thanks, but it's still a small woman. There isn't anything I wouldn't do to please you." He chuckled as he took her nipples into his hands and pulled them hard and said, "Damn it your nipples just turn me on."</p> <p>She let him suck first one nipple and then the other as she reached down to pull, pull, twist and twist her nipples. She pulled them in her fingers, as he cupped her ass cheeks with both hands. "Oh you make my ass so tingly. Oh fuck, you make me feel like I could cum a hundred times."</p> <p>Soon they were both naked on the blanket with nothing between them, both with their arms wrapped around each other as he caressed her beautiful breasts and she caressed the muscular legs of his cock.</p> <p>They laid there savoring the feel of each other, as they slowly recovered from their passion. "Let's do something nice for a drink, we'll go to shore and I'll take you back to your room."</p> <p>"You sure?"</p> <p>"Absolutely. This way we can make the most of the time we have."</p> <p>"How about a nice lunch to go with the wine?"</p> <p>"It sounds nice."</p> <p>She put on a robe and tied it loosely so that she could see all of him on the way. It wasn't terribly different from holding his hand at the airport with her boyfriend. She thought it would be more comfortable being at home without his cock between her legs.</p> <p>They kissed for a few minutes as she walked to the door. "Let me go back to my room," he said.</p> <p>"Okay, let me go back to mine, we both might getâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
