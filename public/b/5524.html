(She did say this, which really felt awkward.) My dick grew another inch, I reached behind me and guided it to the right spot, and felt the slippery liquid glide right past into my ass.</p> <p>"It feels good," Lacey said with a sexy quiver in her voice, like she was proud of the way her ass could swallow my cock up to its hilt. "How does it feel?"</p> <p>I could feel myself swell up a bit, so I told her I was ready. Then I pulled out only to plunge back in. Lacey was smiling, I thought she was happy so I asked, "Do you like it?"</p> <p>"It's hot, you fucking stud," Lacey hissed back at me.</p> <p>I started a steady stream of short strokes, getting into a faster pace as I pumped in and out of the wet, hot tightness of her pussy. Lacey seemed to be on the verge of an orgasm, so I decided to try to pull out a little and let her set the pace. When she did that, she seemed to get that special feeling, a feeling that seemed to make her so good. She put her hands down on the couch, and held on. I gave a couple of pumps up into her, and Lacey came. It came hard over me and all over me, and it felt like liquid fire against the walls of my ass. I tried my best not to go back, but it was a struggle. When I finally pulled it out, Lacey looked at me with those big brown eyes.</p> <p>"That was fantastic," she breathed, holding my hand over her ass and ass. I couldn't help but feel her legs tighten a little, I could tell she was pretty excited.</p> <p>I tried hard not to make a mess in the back of the couch, but some of the sweat had already run down on me. I just hoped it would dry by the time we went home. The fact that we were fucking and talking like lovers probably made the situation even more awkward.</p> <p>Lacey got out of the hot tub and climbed into the shower with me. I looked around for my clothes.</p> <p>"I really don't want my friends to know," Lacey whispered in my ear, and then she got out of the shower too. "Can I come inside the room and change? I don't want my mom to wonder if I do this all the time." Lacey reached back inside her own panties, pulled them off and got under the hot spray, rubbing her pussy furiously as I followed. Lacey stood there in the shower for a minute, letting the water run over her and wash away all the excess sweat that wasn't there.</p> <p>"It's hot," I told her.</p> <p>"Well, I'm going back to the hotel," Lacey said and kissed me. "I can't wait to come back and look in on you for the first time."</p> <p>Lacey finished her shower, and then I carried her on over to my bed. We lay there, me on top of her, and I kept kissing her neck as she rubbed up against me. She ran her hands up and down my back just as I did the same, and I could feel her hot, wet, little tits right in my arms. It felt so good. It would have been nice to have Lacey on a bed that I could sleep on, but it felt more than that to be spooned up next to Lacey with an erection under me. It felt so damn good to be with Lacey, I knew it, because I had so much to tell her.</p> <p>Lacey was breathing faster than I am. "I really would love to come back again. This feels better than the time we spent fucking. I know I'll come back."</p> <p>"I can't believe we're taking this slowly," I said.</p> <p>"I know," Lacey said. The tension had almost gone out of her already. "I want you to go and fuck all night. I wanted you to see me so that you could fuck me all night long. I know what's going on between us. I really, really want you to come back to me."</p> <p>"You don't have to go to bed," I said as I kissed her, stroking her tits gently, "you can stay. I just feel bad. I don't have much time."</p> <p>"Yeah, that's right," Lacey said, rolling me on top of her. I wanted to be inside of her.</p> <p>Lacey was on her fours, her legs up above her head exposing her pussy in all its glory. It looked good enough to eat, though, licked and sucked with her mouth, but what came next was probablyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
