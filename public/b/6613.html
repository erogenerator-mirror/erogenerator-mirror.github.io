I nodded. "But not tonight. Tonight you are free."</p> <p>I was silent.</p> <p>I did not feel comfortable saying what I felt. I did not understand it. I was not sure I could. Perhaps I could be a doctor.</p> <p>"I love you. I want to be your lover. I love you." As he spoke my legs shook and there was no pain.</p> <p>He kissed my forehead and continued. "That's easy, isn't it? You're mine. You will never hurt that way. You will always be mine. I love you."</p> <p>He strode off, and I walked to the bar. It took me a moment to get my heart under control. I picked up my wine glass and drained a mouthful. Then, I walked straight and walked away.</p> <p>What was that? I thought. It was what had happened that night with Brian. The night that I loved them both. Something had happened in that night.</p> <p>And even though the alcohol was taking its toll. I was sure what had happened the previous night was a drug in its own right. It was not a drug I could control, nor did I know what it was, but I could not give myself the ability to control it, so I could avoid what had been.</p> <p>I had the alcohol and I had the drug. It had been a pleasure being with them. Brian had been a fun adventure. Brian might not be my husband and I probably wouldn't feel that way. But I could not stay with either of them. I had to find out who was on my side. I looked in the mirror and the smile on my face was too real. The memory of our first night together had caused me to smile back like some high school girl. It made me feel so vulnerable.</p> <p>"My, my. You two are beautiful. The way you look at each other at dinner." Brian's words caught in my own head. "Don't you have someone in your bed?" He asked.</p> <p>"Of course," I said. "Why wouldn't he?" I looked over at the other man. "And who would he be?" I thought.</p> <p>"Oh! You're Brian's friend." He smiled at me as I looked back at him.</p> <p>"You know how I can help you get rid of that guilt you feel? You don't have to pretend anymore, you can just tell him everything." I said.</p> <p>The smile stayed on his face. I turned on my heels and left, just as the bartender stopped on the way to bring our drinks. I walked past him to the door and let him lead me out to the truck.</p> <p>My hand trembled. I took a breath and then I took another. She didn't want to talk about what happened. She was afraid, afraid she would lose me. I thought, no not lose me but lose our friendshipâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
