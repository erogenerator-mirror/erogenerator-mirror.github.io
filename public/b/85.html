I was entranced by the dance floor when the song finished.</p> <p>It was a little after 9 and the music finally ended. The four of us walked back into the bar, grabbed our drinks and sat down. We talked for a little while, then, my dad said that I was still at school. He looked at me and said to call me anytime. When we got back to the table, my dad asked, "How long has this been going on?"</p> <p>I told him that I had no idea really. I had always figured I would not get in because I was too young to go to school or to school and never had the time. I told him that I would have been interested if all the women who worked for me had a life of their own.</p> <p>Dad laughed and said, "I know. It was a good thing you were doing for me."</p> <p>My dad was smiling. "You did it for me honey. I love you more than anything."</p> <p>When we got home, I immediately changed my clothes and got into bed. I was so fucking horny now that my pussy was soaked. My thoughts raced through my mind. How can I go through with this? What if he rejects me now and doesn't want to do it again, with other women? How will he feel about it? The only thing that would be more convincing would be the thought of him wanting more. Then I thought, "why am I asking him this now?" The answer was simple, I thought, "because I want to keep having sex with him. I've never been that interested in another woman. How can he keep wanting it if he doesn't want to have sex with me anymore?"</p> <p>I was trying to sleep. I don't know what I was thinking but I had made up my mind and I wasn't willing to let it go that easily. In fact, it was a horrible idea. After a few minutes of looking at my watch, I got up and went to take a shower. When I was through, I wrapped myself in a towel and headed back to bed. I had an excellent memory of being with another woman. I have always thought I was attractive and I had never considered that I was gay.</p> <p>"I'll get my own room, if you like, and we can do this again tomorrow," I told him, as I turned out the light and closed my eyes. Sleep arrived again. What could I do but obey.</p> <p>The next day, I walked into my father's office to get my personal things and then into his office in the office on the other side of the building. He came out with a small envelope. He went to another one and took it out. He opened it and read the contents, then looked at me and said, "Now are you going to be one to listen and not obey me?"</p> <p>"I may not listen, Father," I told him, "but you have already told me how I can satisfy you and you want to know just how much I really like." I smiled at that. So, I was just going along with the program I had planned for him.</p> <p>Well, I had not planned for this surprise at all. He told me that it was a surprise I wanted to see. He asked me to take it in hand and he took me into the bedroom to take my clothes off. When I was completely naked, he told me to lie down on my back on the bed. He came down a little ways and straddled my tummy. I felt the first touch of his tongue. He put a finger inside me and I was already moving in rhythm with his tongue.</p> <p>He took his finger out and slowly put the head of his penis against my opening. He told me to "go slow" and he pushed in. He made me move with him and pushed in all the way. I could feel him bottom out in me. At least three or four strokes, he pushed all the way out and held it there. The sensation was different. It felt a lot different between us. There was warmth, as well. It felt like some kind of massage. It was different inside me. I could hardly breathe.</p> <p>It was not a good sensation. It felt like I was being taken to some kind of heaven. I wanted what I had been missing. I had never imagined sex with a man. There was something that I hadn't ever imagined about any of the encounters I had had. Now, I was hoping it was some kind of heaven that would only fit two people and never have anything else. I wanted this to be special because he had told me it would be special. We were going to have sex, like we would all have sex, and it was going to happen from a woman's perspectiveâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
