Not yet anyway. But I had wanted to go to the party with her; to kiss her, hold her...but I wanted to ask something else first and see if it would make things better.</p> <p>So I asked: "What time is everybody supposed to be showing?"</p> <p>She smiled. "When they're just finishing up," she said. She wasn't going to get there. All her friends would be there, but the ones who weren't were coming by the pool early after midnight, so the girls wouldn't arrive until around ten. She didn't want to get them mixed up.</p> <p>I agreed. She was going to go first.</p> <p>At ten the doorbell rang. She looked back at me and then ran over to open the door. We had just finished eating, so she was looking all cute. She had changed out of her swimsuit -- it was a little darker somehow, but it still looked good on her. Her breasts were a little bigger -- just a little bigger, but her nipples were erect, which I enjoyed. It was an amazing sight. They looked bigger all by themselves in her bikini. I wondered if she'd worn a bra. I'd definitely find out.</p> <p>She stood up and said, "Come on in and wait for me." She didn't wait. She started putting on a robe and then stepped into the house as I entered with a large wet robe on over mine. I smiled appreciatively as my head turned slightly to the side to let her see my robe. She was sitting on her bed wearing nothing.</p> <p>"Mhm," she said.</p> <p>"Hmmm?" I asked, taking a sip of water as she sat down on the bed.</p> <p>She put her hands up and looked over at me. "I did what you asked me to do," she said. When it came out as 'Yes'," she nodded towards the TV, "I was hoping to find out the answers to my next question." With that, she leaned over over and kissed me. Her lips were soft and moist and I responded as well. I kissed her back. She responded immediately. She had me by the arms in the kitchen as she held onto me while we kissed. I felt her breasts press against me as she pressed her firm body against me. We kissed passionately like that for what seemed like a very long time. She didn't pull away just long enough to take me in her mouth. I felt her tongue sliding around in my mouth as her breasts continued to be pushed hard against my chest. My dick began to grow at the sight of her breasts, and the realization of what was happening in my bedroom suddenly occurred to me. I wasn't just imagining it or anything, but to imagine in the next part, as well. I realized that she had a hard-on as she kissed me back. I was not going to push my luck this time. I would have to settle for whatever the hell that was going to be.</p> <p>As I got up to get another towel off the hallway, I heard her breathing. I knew she was getting aroused now. As I opened a closet door, I found a light on behind the light. As I opened the light I saw her. There she was. Naked, and looking at me. I knew she was going to have that thing inside her when she came, but this was her first time. She was still so excited about her first time, so I wasn't sure if it was a first time or a second date. I was pretty sure it was a second date.</p> <p>For the next few minutes, we just stood there. I moved towards her, placing my arms around her. We kissed again. For the longest time, neither of us gave an answer. She was in no hurry to break the kiss. It didn't bother me. We hadn't even kissed, a little less than a year. But she was still horny. I think she had been very sexual this whole time. We broke apart and she looked me square in the eyes, but then her eyes drifted back to the TV.</p> <p>"You're the most beautiful and sexy woman in the world," she said and kissed me on the lips. At the same time she was pushing the robe off her shoulders, and at the same time reaching for me. She was still naked, but not as much as when her robe had been on. We were both in our underwear. With nothing else on, we were each in one of my fantasies: naked girls kissing on the kitchen floor, and then my sister-in-law giving me a handjob by her own husband.</p> <p>"I want more," she whispered.</p> <p>"I can't. I'm wearing too much at home, I don't want to keep it all to ourselves," I joked. She looked back at me, looking like she was going to cry, then lookedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
