My mouth automatically latched onto her crotch.</p> <p>In the heat of the moment, her panties were soaked through. As the hem rose higher, I saw her lips part. My mouth took it.</p> <p>"Oh, good." Stacia moaned. The material on the material caught against my mouth. It was soaked. My tongue lashed. I swallowed.</p> <p>The heat grew. The humidity grew. The room grew more humid.</p> <p>"Oh, good." Stacia moaned again. "Just a sec."</p> <p>Her eyes were shut and her arms were spread, elbows on the seat back. She spread her legs. Her right hand gripped the seat belt.</p> <p>I put both of my hands on her hips. I raised my head.</p> <p>"Let's get out of here." She breathed.</p> <p>I leaned in and took a kiss.</p> <p>"That's okay."</p> <p>I gave her clit a quick lick.</p> <p>"Good, baby."</p> <p>We turned toward the car. She got out first. Her face lit up when our faces came together. She turned and kissed me hard on the lips. I reached for her and pulled her close. We began to walk toward her house.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want me to make you an offer?" I said to her. I could see that she was breathing hard.</p> <p>"No, go slow!" she answered.</p> <p>"Is that okay?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes. Let's go."</p> <p>I could feel her breasts pushing against my chest. She pushed her pelvis forward slightly.</p> <p>"If you move back again..." she said.</p> <p>"Do you want me to slow down?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes, just a bit." She answered.</p> <p>We held each other tighter and slowly moved together. We kept kissing. With each kiss, she pulled my jacket and shirt up over my head. I felt her bra and breasts pressing against me. She held me closer and continued to kiss me.</p> <p>I pushed her off of the doorframe and gently pulled her down so our lips touched. She sighed and returned to her feet.</p> <p>She pulled her jacket and shirt off and held onto the doormat. When she stood in front of me, her legs were on either side of me. I held her. My shirt was next. We moved into each others arms, kissing, tongues darting deep in each others mouth.</p> <p>Stacia pulled back, looked me in the eyes, and kissed me again. Her hand went down into my jeans and she pulled out my cock. I put one of my hands on her breast. She looked up at me with those big brown eyes. Her hands took mine and she began to rub my cock. I groaned and pulled Stacia back into my arms.</p> <p>Our kiss got steamy. Stacia moaned into my mouth and moved her hands to my shirt. I undid her bra as she played with my hair. With both of my hands, we worked on our blouses. Her hands slid down my sides and caressed my back.</p> <p>"My shirt!" I cried when I realized it was my shirt.</p> <p>I lifted my arms up. Stacia unfastened my pants and pulled them and my underwear down. We were both naked, me with my cock in her hand.</p> <p>The sound of shoes clacking on the tile and my zipper opening made us stand and walk across the room. It was a long, steamy, slow song with a very sexual tempo.</p> <p>Stacia pulled her panties off and her legs opened. Her fingers ran through the hair which surrounded her sex. With one hand, she pulled my cock, which was standing stiff and upright, into her dripping mouth. The warmth enveloped me and sucked on my cockhead.</p> <p>My hips bucked against Stacia's face.</p> <p>"Jesus!" I gasped.</p> <p>I looked up at Stacia and she brought her mouth off of me. Her eyes had that hungry look again.</p> <p>"Do it!" I urged. "Fuck her."</p> <p>My hands shot to her tits. I grasped at them and began to slowly thrust in and out of her mouth. My cock slid in and out of her throat. She grabbed my cock and slowly stroked it with her tongue.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah," I breathed.</p> <p>My hand slid down to her crotch. I found a patch of hair that I wanted to touch.</p> <p>"Gimme!" I pleaded. "Make me come."</p> <p>Stacia stood with a slow hand to her mouth and mouth onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
