I replied. She shook her head no. I thought. I picked up the bottle of Astroglide and made a big circle around her. Then I placed some on her hand and placed it firmly on her pussy. I started stroking in and out of her. She gasped and closed her eyes. I was not sure how long she could lie there. But I was sure that she had reached the point where she would come. I slowed down my rhythm as I felt the beginning of my own orgasm approaching. I started stroking a little farther, feeling her pussy tighten around me more. I was pumping harder now...I knew she was about to come.</p> <p>'Cum,' I heard myself say. "NOW!" She screamed with a loud yell. Her legs tightened around me and her whole body shook. I felt it pulse out as much as it could, and I was about to do it again when she shook once more and began her orgasm. And again. I slowed down and continued, enjoying the feeling of her pussy squeezing me like a vice, but also knowing my own orgasm was nearly at an end. I felt her body trembling again.</p> <p>"Oh shit," she gasped when she released it. I continued stroking and felt that it was almost time to pull out.</p> <p>"Okay, you can pull out now." I said, trying to maintain as calm a voice as I would. She seemed a little embarrassed that I was about to pull out, but then she smiled to herself and went back to stroking my cock. I started to pull out when I noticed the tip of it was dripping with her juices.</p> <p>"That's okay." I said.</p> <p>She looked down at herself and gasped again. "Oh, god...oh."</p> <p>I felt her hand stroking me. When it touched her clit it almost sent me over the edge, but I had reached the point of my own orgasm now. I was almost done with her when I saw her eyes widen and her chest heave. I continued to stroke her, but she was going completely stiff. I stopped.</p> <p>"Cum for me?" I heard her whisper.</p> <p>"You want to cum." I replied.</p> <p>"I want to come for you."</p> <p>"Okay." I reached down and grabbed the end of the bed for her shoulders. "Now, put your legs down."</p> <p>"Okay." She replied, sitting up slowly.</p> <p>I reached for the bottle of lube that I had placed there and put some on her shoulders, massaging it into her shoulders. I pushed her further down in the bed and leaned over her to put some on my cock. I kept up a slow slow in and out motion just as she had before, and slid one arm under her to keep her legs above her head. I slowly slid back into her and started working in and out with my hand. I had never seen her so turned on before, more than once. I could feel her breathing speeding up and knew she was getting close. Her orgasm was starting to ripple through her body and I could feel the heat build up.</p> <p>"Oh my god...now." I heard her say. "Now."</p> <p>"Don't stop."</p> <p>'Cum." She said. "I...I am almost there." And I felt her body start to shake with this announcement.</p> <p>"Oh!" Came next. "Cumming!"</p> <p>I started pumping into her harder. I could feel her body go completely stiff as her orgasm took her over. I felt like I was just about there myself myself, and continued to work her with slow and methodical strokes until I felt her body go limp again. I was able to stay inside her now, holding her hips and her legs while she lay there with her head on the pillow.</p> <p>"Sorry that was such a rush." I mumbled, and her head came up for a moment after a moment of silence. Then her eyes were sparkling again and she turned her head and gave me a deep, kiss. "That was awesome." She grinned.</p> <p>"It sure was," was my response.</p> <p>"You're a man." I said, looking at her. "Do you need something?"</p> <p>She grinned again. "Just for now," she answered.</p> <p>I stood and took my clothes off. The room smelled like sex, and she lay there in the aftermath of her orgasm, catching her breath. I looked at her naked body next to me, and she seemed to get lost in what I was doing. My hardness was pressing against her. She noticed and reached down, taking my cock in her hand and giving it an extra stroke. "You're not done," she said and kissed me again.</p> <p>"Of course not."
