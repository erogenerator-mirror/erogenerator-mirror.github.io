I really got that impression when she came in and we were chatting when the waiter came," Mary said, pointing to the front of the restaurant. "I saw that she had a little more than an outfit on."</p> <p>"Did you think that she was naked?"</p> <p>"A little bit," Mary replied. "It took me a while to figure it out, but she was. I'm starting to think that we might be lucky to get a free sample of a few of them."</p> <p>"Well, look it up tonight," John said, getting a hard-on. "I think we should let her get a good taste of what we do at the cabin before we take her home."</p> <p>"Really? And have you and the girls get back in bed with her?" Mary said, nodding emphatically. "We're going to have to do something about that. But before I do you two need to get me something to drink," John said, handing Mary a cup. "I think there's a nice vodka on the table. Make sure you don't get high again."</p> <p>She drained her glass, noticing for the first time how slim her legs looked. "Maybe in a minute," her reply was followed by one of the most sensual ones she had ever heard. "I'm gonna need a little help."</p> <p>John laughed. "No, not right now," he said playfully.</p> <p>"But I still want you," Mary said quickly, raising her glass to the table. "And I don't care if you are on the job or on the road all weekend. I just want to know where you are and how you are doing in the meantime."</p> <p>"Why would you want to know?" John said and Mary giggled. "This is all starting to make sense to me. I've been thinking about being with you ever since you started working here."</p> <p>They laughed together as he placed another glass of liquor on the table. The conversation continued until at last Mary broke it.</p> <p>"John, you need to get in the shower and change your clothes. I'll get something to wear in the kitchen."</p> <p>Mary said her goodbyes to John and took a long, hot shower. The hot water that cascaded down her body felt wonderful on her skin. She took out several items from her wardrobe and changed into a sexy pink baby doll halter dress without a bra. When she came out, she was already getting her hair style done and fixing her makeup and hair when the phone rang. She knew from the caller id that it was the cruise ship and would take them down to the cabin for several hours. She picked up the phone and immediately got on all fours on the bed that contained a chair and a towel. She pulled her legs up under her with her knees bent and knees together and turned to answer the phone.</p> <p>"Hi, this is Mary," Mary heard the sound of the voice on the other end. "How are you? I want to talk to you for a minute."</p> <p>Mary was a little surprised that she hadn't heard the man on the other end of the line. It was John that was answering and she knew not to interrupt him. He was not the sort to interrupt without trying to be the good man by asking if she was ready for more.</p> <p>"Mary," Mary said a little more forcefully when he asked. "I'm ready for you as soon as possible so why don't we try some dinner together before we begin our vacation?"</p> <p>"Sounds good." Mary thought. She wasn't sure that John was going to be able to satisfy her for very long. Not long now. Maybe too long.</p> <p>"Is that okay?" Mary asked, her voice filled with emotion. "Do I have to wear this dress?"</p> <p>John laughed and said, "That's fine! I'm just going to get dressed, now."</p> <p>Mary wanted to tell him that she didn't want to change clothes but she could not bring herself to do it. She just wanted him to have an opportunity to make love to her before they came out of the house. Besides, she knew she owed him that much. "Do you really think it would work out?" Mary asked.</p> <p>"I don't know," John said. "I'm not completely sure but I think this might work out." But Mary knew that she could tell him for sure. John had been right about one thing: She didn't want to spend time alone with John on an island with no one.</p> <p>"If this works out, then I think we should go ahead and do this then," Mary said. "You don't know that I had to see some of yourâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
