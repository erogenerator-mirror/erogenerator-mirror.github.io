She just smiled.</p> <p>I turned to head back to the dining room where I found an empty table.</p> <p>"Why am I here so late?" I asked. "Is anyone supposed to go with me?" Amanda turned to say something and I leaned over and kissed her gently on the lips.</p> <p>"Honey, you were perfect," I assured her.</p> <p>She kissed me back passionately, then reached and cupped my cheek.</p> <p>"I'm really sorry that this happened."</p> <p>"I'm still just excited."</p> <p>"You're not," she said, kissing me tenderly.</p> <p>I had two thoughts racing through my mind. I'd loved everything that happened the last couple of months and it really hadn't been a bad experience for me, but I was still very turned-on by it. I had a raging hard-on that needed to be released.</p> <p>When Amanda finished kissing me and we both went to our meals, I stood by the table, looking at her. I tried to think about what she was thinking, but nothing really seemed to be there. "That's great, I really enjoyed it."</p> <p>She just stared at me for a few minutes before saying, "I'll get you for that."</p> <p>I stood up and followed her to the kitchen door. "I know," I said and then kissed her on the cheek.</p> <p>"You still have the most delightful taste of cum in my mouth, David," she said, giggling a little. She came to me and kissed me quickly. "You'll get all the cum I can stand before I'll leave," she said, laughing.</p> <p>We finished breakfast, got dressed and headed to our offices, where Amanda and I sat in a conference room. After making a couple of calls, we put it into words, "We need to get it together before it is too late." While waiting for the call to come back on, Amanda and I both sat, thinking. Asking ourselves, it didn't take that long.</p> <p>It was after 10:00 at the conference and we weren't at the table very long - we didn't want to go anywhere before noon - so when one of the other guys called, we asked if he could stay the night.</p> <p>I was still sitting at the conference table when Amanda came up to me and handed me the phone. We talked for a minute or two.</p> <p>"So, how are you doing?" I asked once we were done talking.</p> <p>"I'm doing OK," she said. "I'm just going to go home. I'm so excited that I could cry." She took the phone and started crying. It sounded like her.</p> <p>"Honey, that was wonderful. Thank you so much. I felt so good when you were sucking me off. I was so turned-on. When you went down on me, it felt awesome. I've got some bad news. I'll call you tomorrow afternoon. Can you hold me until then?"</p> <p>"Yes, of course."</p> <p>As she hung up the phone, she said, "I really thought it would be better if we didn't have to come back tonight. We can call in after lunch. Why don't we call the mall and let them know there won't be any customers."</p> <p>"Honey, we're on the way home. I just can't leave you hanging for a month. We can't be back this late."</p> <p>We talked about how much I really enjoyed what we had done, how much I liked it, and she said it sounded like we'd be OK. It was a good job she hadn't said she was going home to fuck me after we got it out of her system or I'm sure mine would have followed her back to the hotel.</p> <p>Before she left, she turned to kiss me, and when I turned, she put her arms around me and kissed me again. I took her face in my hands and kissed her back.</p> <p>When we broke for air, we both just stared at each other in disbelief.</p> <p>"What was that all about?" she asked, taking a chance.</p> <p>"I'm not entirely sure, but after what happened, I don't know whether I can wait for tomorrow."</p> <p>We kissed again before she said, "Maybe I should just take my clothes off, before we go out somewhere to really make out."</p> <p>I didn't argue with her and we just went back to the conference room where we had some time. As we were setting up the meeting in our respective offices, it was time for us to make love, or just maybe have some sex, I'm not sure whoâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
