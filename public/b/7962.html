She cried out as he pulled off.</p> <p>"Shhh!" He hissed, "You know you are wet, so don't stop." She looked up at him, her face a mask of confusion and anger, her eyes wild with the fear as she continued to lick her pussy.</p> <p>"Lose those shorts." He pushed his shorts right off his hips revealing a dark, hard cock throbbing with need. He reached out and grabbed hold of her hair, yanking her head back causing his cock to leap up to her face.</p> <p>"No!" She shrieked, trying to push him down, "Not without you cumming."</p> <p>"It's all you have to say. I have cum in my hand all over, so we don't need any more." He lifted his cock again and with one quick motion, a glob of silky jizz appeared at her lips. He was right, she loved it. It felt like she had gotten every fucking drop of Jethro's seed.</p> <p>"Come on, lick it. Suck on the head." He urged.</p> <p>As quickly as it came, it was over. He grabbed her head, jerking himself off into her awaiting mouth. Spurt after spurt of jizz flooded into her throat, leaving her coughing and gagging and gagging and making little mewling sounds. As he was pulling out of her mouth, he stood and took off his clothes. Cara was still on heat and couldn't understand what was happening or why. He stood over her nakedness, still recovering from his blowjob. He didn't see the need in her eyes so he slowly pulled his flaccid dick out and stood over her again.</p> <p>"Suck on your own tits. That was great." He said with a smile as he dropped his shorts and walked around to stand above her. Cara was still frozen in shock, unable to move as he held his hard cock up to her face. She wanted so bad to suck him off. She was so confused by all this excitement and fear, she could barely think straight, yet so close to him.</p> <p>"I need your cum on top of mine." He told her, "Lick it off."</p> <p>To her shock, she leaned in, her eyes still wide. She took a taste of him. It was a musky taste, warm, salty, and so sweet. As she did, he dropped his left arm, leaving his arm hanging over her head and went back to his rhythm. Cara moved her lower extremity around to her clit. She felt her juices gush down over his shaft and drip onto his lower belly. As she did, her pussy started to contract around her fingers and she couldn't resist her pussy any longer. Her eyes and mouth went numb with the pleasure. She began to cum, her whole body pulsing and jerking with every beat of his rhythm. He continued to press himself deeper, watching, as his cock filled everything inside of her.</p> <p>Finally, Cara could stop cumming. Her head lolled back, eyes still closed. She lifted her head but his hand was still holding it in place. He leaned his body against hers as both bodies convulsed into one. The room began to spin, not only was it still amazing, but all of it was intense. As she collapsed on her side, he held her as she collapsed against him and felt his cock soften. He held her for a brief moment, still half asleep. Then he pulled his now flaccid dick out. As he did, he said to Cara, "God you are a beautiful sight."</p> <p>"That, my cock..." she started to say something but he grabbed her head in a hard, crushing kiss.</p> <p>"No..." He said, pulling back slightly. "If you were a woman and I was a man..." He stopped, his voice soft, as if wanting not to say another word. "If I were a man, I would kill you in just one night. And I would be the one taking you..." He kissed her again.</p> <p>"Then you would do whatever I told you to do." Cara whispered as she put her arms around his neck, pulling him down to her. "I want to suck your cock, Jack. I want so much more of your cum in my mouth and down my throat. Now!"</p> <p>He reached down and grasped her by the hair, pulling her to her feet. Cara turned to face him. Taking his cock, he led her down the hallway to the guest room. He pushed her down on top of the covers on the bed, her eyes still closed as he pushed himself off and came to sit behind her.
