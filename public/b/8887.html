Once there, I took off my coat and sat back down. I crossed my legs and sat down in front of Eric again.</p> <p>He stood and walked across and sat down next to me. He leaned forward and kissed me gently a soft full kiss. My mouth opened and his tongue slowly explored my lips and I opened for him as he did before. He pulled away and looked at my face.</p> <p>"You OK?" he asked.</p> <p>"Oh yeah! It felt fantastic and I've been thinking about this for ages"</p> <p>"This is a big step! What are we going to do, we shouldn't be doing this?"</p> <p>"We should have at least let the situation get a little sexual and that would have happened but today was amazing and tonight is amazing."</p> <p>"I'm surprised we're still on for the wedding, I've just got to say I'd like it better if we made this a threesome."</p> <p>"We'll find out sooner or later," he said.</p> <p>I kissed his lips gently and he kissed my nose and told me he'd be in touch in a few days, we said goodnight and I went home. I looked in the mirror and thought about what had just happened but I felt good at the moment and couldn't wait until it was his turn. It was going to be hard not to call Eric and tell him what the next couple of days had in store and I hoped the experience would be an experience of an amazing and fantastic weekendâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
