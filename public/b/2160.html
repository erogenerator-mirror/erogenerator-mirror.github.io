OH!" she screamed out again and again until her pussy was stretched completely around him.</p> <p>He slid in and out for a while and they became more animated, both of them wanting more.</p> <p>"Do it! Fuck me again!" she almost yelled.</p> <p>"Do it!" Paul said, more of her body in control. He reached up and took a handful of her breast in each hand and squeezed them gently, pulling on them.</p> <p>"Harder!" she demanded. They kept fucking until she got close. "Oh! Oh!" she moaned again. "Faster, more!" she chanted. They were both working each other, their bodies moving with a rhythm that was both wild and exciting.</p> <p>"Oh! Yes! Oh! Yes!"</p> <p>"I'm gonna cum!" she yelled, then she said, "I love you, Paul!" He pulled out and came on her stomach, then she pushed him on his back. "Do it, do it, I love you!" she cried.</p> <p>Paul's body was still spasming, and he was surprised at how far he had gone to finish before. He laid there and was about to pull away when she said, "Let's do it together."</p> <p>With that, she climbed on him, kissed his mouth and tongue, then reached his cock, which was still half hard, to suck on it. He looked down at her and could see her hand caressing his balls and cock and he felt like he had only just finished. He was still on his back, but he could now control himself.</p> <p>She got to her knees and straddled he and guided his cock into her.</p> <p>"I love you too, Paul!" she said. She bent over and kissed him, then leaned her head down on his shoulder and started to fuck him again. Paul held back until he heard her moan.</p> <p>"Do it, I love it. Do it!" the words came from her again almost like they were music to his ears.</p> <p>"Uh! Uh! Ah!" he grunted as he kept going. He felt her pussy muscles contracting around him as they worked together.</p> <p>Soon her body came with a rush of warmth and she started to shake. She started to say 'fuck, ah!' and then she shuddered again. "Do it!" she screamed. Paul got up and got on his knees, aiming his cock at her pussy to get it in as deep as possible. But he felt like his cock was going to burst and he didn't want to put it anywhere near her ass, but he knew he'd give her one hell of a pounding that eveningâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
