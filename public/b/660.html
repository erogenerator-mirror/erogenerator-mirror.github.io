"That was...that was amazing. Thank you...thank you!" she called out.</p> <p>With a huge grin on her face, I said; "Thanks." Then added: "You didn't think it would be me that turned you on?"</p> <p>She just smiled and kissed me. She pulled the covers back on her bed and said: "I think we need to talk a little more."</p> <p>I didn't argue and soon we were fast asleep.</p> <p>It was a couple hours before her parents went to sleep again. I was still turned on and horny for her. I got up and moved between her legs. "Please keep kissing me." she said softly. I kissed her lightly on her lips and she opened her mouth again to kiss me. She parted her legs and I could go further. So I eased my way back then I was licking her. Her tongue met mine and she started moaning softly, so I eased more. Slowly my tongue moved up to her clit and she made a low "aah" sound and her hips pushed up. I teased it but couldn't get to it. She moved her leg and brought it down and opened her legs. She was moaning even louder. I was still licking, but was going to let my tongue find it's way to her other clit. It happened very quickly.</p> <p>"Oh, god!" she said. She grabbed my head and pushed my face as tightly against her pussy as she could. I was feeling her orgasm. After a while she moved her legs away from me and wrapped them around my waist. She moved her legs so they were resting above my face. I was looking up her body and when my eyes met hers I smiled and opened my mouth. I ran my tongue as far inside her pussy as I could go as she started moaning and I felt her cum hit my tongue.</p> <p>She moved one hand over my shoulder and kissed my cheeks and neck and neck so I felt completely relaxed with her. Then she pulled me closer and said: "I've never been with someone like you."</p> <p>We laid there silently for a minute then she said: "I've had boyfriends before who wanted nothing to do with me. They said if I didn't like it, they would throw it away and not talk about it again, even if they really liked me."</p> <p>I laughed: "You've never tried to take it out of me?"</p> <p>She smiled as she took my face in her hands and ran her tongue lightly on it. "Only those that were ready to be with me, but you... I'm nervous, but I don't ever want to disappoint you." She put her head on my shoulder and started to move a finger on one breast and with the other hand she was stroking my dick. "It wasn't that they couldn't have a chance with me, but you make me feel good too. You're an amazing lover."</p> <p>Her eyes were locked with mine smiling a soft smile as she asked: "Doesn't this hurt?"</p> <p>She was looking at me with an eye that I had never seen in them before, which I was so nervous. Then with a quiet laugh she said: "No, there is no pain. Do you feel any pain at all?"</p> <p>"Only pleasure." I said in a voice that was so soft that I feared we might wake up the whole house.</p> <p>Then her smile left her face again and she kissed my lips again with a more loving kiss than she had just given me. "You are just amazing." she said and she pushed closer again. She was rubbing my dick on its head and kissing the side of my face again. I felt her kiss her cheek, neck and on my face again. Then she took my head in her hands and kissed my forehead. Then she said: "I want to keep you with me for as long as possible. But before we sleep again; I promise I don't want you to use the bed, but can I tell you something?"</p> <p>I agreed and I moved her legs and my hand from between hers. I felt both her hands go around to my cock and they touched it softly. I pulled hers from my eyes and looked into her eyes and my mouth slowly lowered its focus. "Okay?" I said in a whisper.</p> <p>She squeezed my cock, which was still hard as if I had been holding back the day before. It had been so long since I had had sex.
