Jim's face fell a little lower. "I know how my employees get to me and their little fantasies. In those particular scenarios I get some pretty aggressive looks. Now stop looking at me that way."</p> <p>She didn't reply. Her hands continued to stroke my face. In a way she was enjoying the touch so much that it almost felt as though they became two parts of her. She could clearly picture me as my eyes looked between them, looking at her.</p> <p>My cock stirred in her hands and she knew that I knew she was enjoying it. She started with a light touch. It was so nice. She moved higher until her hand was almost touching the tip with each stroke. She began moving with me, feeling me and enjoying it. I continued to stare at her. Her body felt so amazingly good. It was like a massage and she was so tight and warm. I felt my cock throbbing and was sure that she would feel it, but she continued to hold it.</p> <p>"This is what you wanted. It's so much more intimate when a strong man is there that you are alone and has everything to offer. You're so vulnerable and have no idea of what the future holds. It's all your power."</p> <p>"Is it my power, Sir?"</p> <p>"That's right. Your power is all I need. When a man is looking at you, there's an image in his mind that you're beautiful. When he stares at you, you're in control of his lust, which allows him to let it happen any time he wants."</p> <p>She continued to caress me as I watched. I could do nothing as she watched.</p> <p>"Do it Jim. Put yourself in his place. Don't make promises you can't keep. Make it your life. Give him what he needs."</p> <p>That was like an angel. She still held my cock firmly and smiled, "Very good."</p> <p>She continued to caress me with her hands. She was smiling as she felt my cock throb in her hands.</p> <p>"I want to feel it. Go ahead. Feel it. Feel it. Be a man. Feel it in your mind."</p> <p>I was enjoying everything she was doing to me. She was so good and I didn't know why. It sort of came naturally to me but I needed to know how it felt for all these years. She still held it firmly and just smiled as I began responding to everything she did to me.</p> <p>"I see you have your own fantasies. Maybe I can help you get that release I asked about, but for those you can do this one other thing you shouldn't do. That one little bit here, with your eyes. It's called a kiss"</p> <p>I felt her lips slowly touch mine.</p> <p>"I see you understand exactly what is going through your mind when you look at me."</p> <p>All that was important was that we weren't talking about that. I wanted her to kiss me. I wanted her lips to touch mine. She smiled and brought her mouth just a little closer.</p> <p>"I will never ask you something like that Jim. I know from that kiss that you enjoy every opportunity to just feel me. Don't be afraid to give in to your inner feelings. We are both men and if you feel any self-respect, you will know that your mind can do that."</p> <p>Before she continued with the talk she had been kissing my face all over. I felt her lips part as she gently kissed the corner of my mouth. I looked at her and she saw the desire in my eyes.</p> <p>"I could kiss you Jim." She asked. "I would have to let you feel me. It would be the first time you would ever have your own lips upon yours. Your own man."</p> <p>I still held her head and she seemed to want to hold me as she kissed me. I kissed her and she kissed back. It was like a very sweet kiss that neither one of us wanted it to stop.</p> <p>She could tell I was getting a little aroused. "I want you so much Jim. I need to feel you inside me. I've been longing for that and have been craving this since the first time I set foot in my office."</p> <p>That made her feel good and I felt her pressing down, even though she was holding me, trying to guide me inside her. It felt like a warm glove on top of my body. She really was the one in control here. She held me tight and kissed my neck and I felt myself going as far up her neck as I could go. I reached out a hand to feel the softness of her shoulder. It was so soft.</p> <p>I felt her arms surround me as we sat on her desk with her on her stomach.
