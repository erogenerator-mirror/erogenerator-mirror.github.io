I love every second of our time together and never wanted anything more in my life then for her to come back. I love her deeply from the very heart that I have for her and from our love for each other. You must be proud." Her words were so sincere and I felt she had the best of the two girls I would never even tell until I was back on Earth. She then hugged me and kissed my lips. "See, you're not the only one with feelings for her...you're the only one with your heart set on her love and being together with her is just what love is. I knew just from talking with you that she could make you feel that much."</p> <p>I smiled. "I feel that way about you too, but not as much as you. There was something just between us for a couple of weeks. You made that very clear enough when you asked me to make love with her. It made me think about being with a man like you two had never had their way with. I know I'm not good enough for you, but to be honest, I don't blame you if you couldn't satisfy her. She was a good girl as far as I could tell, but you are not what I'd call a slut."</p> <p>"You should know that when you came back in time, even though I was not alone, I never had someone as good in bed as she was the first time she had let go and been able to enjoy herself. She's not as pretty with her face like she used to be, but there is a difference between being a sexy young woman and someone as old as you are. So what do you say if we continue to see her? She's yours."</p> <p>I smiled and kissed her lips. "I would love to see you try and make love to her again. I think we've had as much as we can take to start a new relationship. I think you might end up with someone you trust more then your heart, but I know I don't have that in mind. So what do you say? " She smiled.</p> <p>It was a very serious and meaningful smile. "There is one issue which I think you need to discuss with her first. I believe you need some new friends and something to be sure you can make them happy. What do you mean by new friends? I mean, you and her aren't just going to hang out there a while longer?"</p> <p>I thought about the conversation and finally decided that I'd better take the deal and just leave it there and see what would happen. I guess that I'd better tell her that I'd like to join in and that I'd rather stay, but I'd also like to be a new friend. It's kind of a strange thing to ask your ex, but I think it's worth a try too.</p> <p>With that in mind, I asked, "What time do you have to be here? I'd love to spend the whole day with her. Let's get some lunch so we can start to see what our evening can bring and I'll see her tomorrow?"</p> <p>I felt really good that a wonderful girlfriend was spending the day with me before the first time we made love. If we could have one of those, we could have the most fantastic romantic date in the world after we spent all day together. It was so romantic and we were so lucky to have each other. Her parents were going to be there and it wouldn't be too difficult to make love to each other. We had the whole day and I was going to be there the whole time if that's what she wanted.</p> <p>We left the airport and she went to the ladies room, as I had expected. She returned naked and was almost as naked as I was. She sat down on the commode and let me take a shower. We got into it and were soon joined by Kim.</p> <p>We got into all kinds of interesting positions and just kept on thinking about each other's bodies for several days. Kim had me put her on my back and eat her pussy until she came in my mouth. After we'd had our meal I put her on her back, with me straddled over her and lowered myself on top of her. We just settled into a nice slow rhythm as Kim whispered to me, "Make love to me, Dave. I know you can't wait to have her."</p> <p>Kim was definitely a woman who knew how to make me feel good with her words. I think I'll be wanting to put my nose to her sweet smelling pussy all night. It's a miracle you have a girl that you can make love to anytime you want. Kim is beautiful and sexy, very sexy. You could just ask and you'd answer that. I think I need to have a long talk with her and what it does to you when you can't keep your mind on your feet.
