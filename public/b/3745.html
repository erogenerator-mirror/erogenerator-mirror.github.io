You came." said a happy Tim.</p> <p></p> <p>"Where are you honey? Are you decent?" she asked, knowing he needed a good bath.</p> <p>Tim and Tim met at the bar; Tim was wearing just a t-shirt and sweat pants, and as he looked his wife over and saw that she also was decent, and had a robe on, and said "Yes, I'm decent. I'm just gonna go get some food, while you get undressed and I go put on something a little better and then we'll talk." said he wife while standing there with her robe on and a drink in hand.</p> <p></p> <p>"Okay." Tim said. "I think it's time to talk too. I haven't been able to get your advice about a proper bath for your husband, and my wife has always been one to wear something better." said Tim.</p> <p></p> <p>Tori could hear him talking to his wife, and she just smiled at him.</p> <p>She then felt his hand slide across hers, and she just smiled back at him, and said "Hi, I'm Tori, I'm an old friend from high school, and I'd like you to introduce me to your husband, my boyfriend tonight? We both will have an excuse to get off, and get cleaned up for the evening."</p> <p></p> <p>Tim could see the smile cross her face, and then his mind went to something else, and he said "Okay, you know what I mean. It's not hard. I'm an old friend. You and my wife sure can't run away like this, could you? So let me get you some food, and we'll talk later, okay?"</p> <p></p> <p>Tim and Tam could hear Tim laughing at his old friend, as he sat there thinking what he could do to make his wife feel so good. Tim had been thinking and talking to his wife for the past few years, with all his efforts, and his success. Finally, he said "No, you don't have to do anything. I love you."</p> <p></p> <p>It was Tim's turn to smile, and Tori could feel his heart beating a little a little faster right now. Tori didn't know how to react to that, so she just smiled and nodded her head to him, and went on with the conversation, and let her robe fall off, and sit down. Tim went upstairs and brought in a bowl of water mixed with some salad and chicken salad and two bottles of wine. He put the empty one in the middle of the table near the wall. Tori looked up from eating, and saw him come down and sit beside her. "I think something is going on in here, and I don't know what you mean, just go put on some shorts. I like, but for now go to the guest room at the other end of the house, while I get supper. We'll be back in a little while." said Tim, and Tim turned to walk out and go to the front room, and he stopped and turned and looked back at her, and said "It's okay. That's not a bad idea. Let's get cleaned up, and I'll take you to my bedroom now."</p> <p></p> <p>Tim said "That's okay." and he smiled at Tori again. But it took for now at least as long for them both to figure it out. After they got done, Tim went to the other end of the house to get dressed and get another bottle of wine, and they talked a little. Tori asked him about his and Tim's relationship, and Tim said he met a woman about ten years ago when he finished his degree. Tim talked about his ex-wife, and he told him he knew what love was, but he still thought it was so long ago, that he missed it. After he had finished, he went upstairs and got a clean shirt, and had it on when he had gone upstairs. He went to the other end of the house and just sat there, and when Tim came back down he had some more wine in his and took a couple of swallows.</p> <p></p> <p>"Where were you? We went to the guest room, and I was going to put the dinner on, and I never got that chance. I should have got your keys, and let go, but you didn't give up, so I just sat there and listened." said Tim.</p> <p></p> <p>Tori could still feel her heart beating fast inside and now it was back to normal. He said, "I'm sorry you and I missed the best thing that ever happened to me, when you were like that.
