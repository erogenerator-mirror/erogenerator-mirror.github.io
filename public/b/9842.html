His fingers slid into her body, finding her clit in the process. She felt her hips rise, lifting from the floor as her moans changed, becoming ragged.</p> <p>Lifting her off the ground, he held her body up as he lowered her back down. Her skin ran a slow up-down of the sunrays and her clit grew hard under his touch. Her hands caressed his strong shoulders as he stood, his cock still trapped in her sex.</p> <p>He lifted, setting her on her feet as he sat on the bed and reached down to lay her down across his lap. He looked up at her, his blue eyes staring at her. "I'm sorry," he said at last.</p> <p>"Don't be," she said at his words. "I wanted you to and when I felt your cock touch me it was the best sex I've had in a while."</p> <p>He wrapped his arms around her and pulled her over toward him. Her hips swung her body to him and he kissed her, gently at first, and then harder with the urgency of his desire. She was hot against his skin and her breathing was ragged. He moved lower, the heat and hardness his cock had started to grow more urgent. Holding her hips lightly in his hands he pressed himself against her. He slid the head of his cock into her pussy and she moaned into the kiss.</p> <p>Slowly, he pushed further inside of her body, pressing against her. Then it was there, the feeling, as the soft flesh stretched to accommodate him as he filled her. She felt the warm length of him as the head of his cock pressed against her core. She closed her eyes, savoring the feeling. She raised her hips against him; her arms tightened around him as his hands held her hips. He began to grind his cock against her and she was on her own. When he stopped, she felt empty and empty again, his cock sliding against her skin.</p> <p>"I can't," she whispered into the kiss. He smiled at her and she leaned back against him, his length in her. "I can't."</p> <p>He kissed her again and he began to move beneath her body. She felt her own body begin to respond and she tightened her hips. He had to know just how she felt. She smiled against his mouth and her hand moved down, fingers wrapping around his thick length. He was so hard right now and she loved the feeling. He pressed against her belly, his hands pulling at her hips. She felt her thighs part and then she felt the tip of him slide between her wet lips. He began to thrust inside of her as he pressed his body against hers, both of them feeling each other. They moaned into each other's mouth before his lips were against her neck. She felt his tongue lick the sensitive skin there and she groaned. His hands held her hips still while he thrust into her body. He felt her body responding to him and she squeezed her muscles around him.</p> <p>They both broke the kiss as his own body began to spasm. He felt his head slip inside her body while she arched her back and screamed against his lips. He felt her body clamp around his member and he froze himself before he climaxed, holding himself inside of her. He had to know just how she felt. He wanted to know so badly for sure, but he was afraid that would cause her any more pain than she had already suffered.</p> <p>He pulled out of her body, pulling her down until she was on her back. He leaned up over her, his lips on hers again. He kissed her gently and her tongue probed at his lips. He felt the urgency in her kiss and he opened his mouth wider to take her as he pulled it back deep into his body. He moved his arms around her, holding her hips. She felt him pull away from her and he rolled to his side. Without a word he pulled her from the bed, pulling her with him so she fell onto her stomach. He moved up behind her, her head on his stomach, his arms around her, his arms holding her back against him and his cock deep inside of her body.</p> <p>"I think we should talk now." He whispered, reaching back to stroke her earlobe. She closed her eyes and rolled her neck back, looking at him. "We've done all this time, but I still feel a little selfish right now," she said, pushing at him to get up.</p> <p>"I don't know," he agreed, climbing off the bed and moving to her side. He leaned over and kissed her, feeling the tension leave her body. She smiled at him and reached back to grab his cock with her hand.
