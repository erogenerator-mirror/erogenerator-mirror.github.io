She had to know! He hadn't even kissed her yet, at least not yet!</p> <p>"Oh, I'm good."</p> <p>Then we fucked a little at a time until I got her to have a couple orgasms and she got off as well. We made love there in the middle of the day and as things cooled down she was very open about it. She had gotten me a pair of panties and bras with matching hose. I bought her a teddie and pantie. But the first time we were in bed I hadn't planned on anything that weekend other than making up for all our time apart. She still had her underwear from her trip and she even wore hers under her clothes and now that she had, we were both totally naked and the day had passed.</p> <p>One thing led to another and we were having sex for over an hour. We were both so worked up from our earlier activities! We kissed each other so passionately and I wanted to cum again.</p> <p>"Are you going to cum again after that?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes!"</p> <p>"Let me feel you cum in here."</p> <p>After feeling my cock pulsing in her pussy I held on to her hips until I felt it pulsing through my cock. Then my cock went down with a little splash of come on the sheet.</p> <p>She started laughing and said, "Now I know why you brought me back so quickly!"</p> <p>We showered again and I was a little worried about her. She felt so vulnerable being naked and in that position. She also felt so naked and vulnerable, I even thought I saw a couple of little pokes of her boobs as she got out of the shower. She looked very erotic.</p> <p>We talked a lot. She told me that all I had been up to was trying to get her to have sex with someone else. I had made lots of advances and found lots of women attractive in their own unique ways. She told me that she had met a guy in high school who had a crush on her. They had shared their histories as far back as we knew. He and she both agreed to go to a swinger party but that didn't get them any further. Neither did I. We knew some people and I found it hard to keep up with them!</p> <p>I had an idea that we might be able to find a good guy and get him into bed with us. If it was the right guy we might have to go to a motel or a gay bar or to a club again. We just didn't know how close!</p> <p>Two days later we were at a small conference on business management and the subject had never been raised by any of our colleagues. I guess I was having some trouble getting everyone who hadn't been invited into the conference to agree, at one point. They just didn't seem all that interested in hearing about my ideas the other day! I had already made a couple of contacts and talked to several of the people in their companies when I talked to one. It was pretty much the same as talking with a married couple with kids in a wedding. They were getting a free pass.</p> <p>I knew I would be getting into a tight spot, but I didn't think it would be a great place to have my talk to a couple in the conference! I told them to leave us alone. I told them I was the only one for sure that I would do what I had done with them this afternoon. I told them I would be with the couple that I had been with last night. I went ahead and left to meet with the other people from the other side of the conference.</p> <p>She came at me but was still laughing.</p> <p>"What can I do? You really turned down a whole bunch of requests from me yesterday and you're still laughing! That was funny! Look at your hands! They look like I just had my third orgasm!" She was grinning. I just went and stood.</p> <p>It was going to be close to a minute until we got some information out of her and she really was getting into it!</p> <p>"OK, here goes. Our first question was why did you do it?"</p> <p>"It's not that I'm not doing it, it's just that it was all so unexpected!"</p> <p>She had a serious look on her face.</p> <p>"Why did you do it with him?"</p> <p>"No, it wouldn't have been unexpected. Just to be honest, we were planning on it before we set a date. You should have known, I didn't want that to be too late."</p> <p>"OK, let's have it, but you can't be that easy!"</p> <p>"I was hoping to be more, but... that's OK... that's enough. I still don't know what you're after but don't push. You do know there are plenty of guys who would be happy to fuck you, rightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
