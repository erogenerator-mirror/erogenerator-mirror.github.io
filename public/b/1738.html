"No, I know. The reason is because you had your little 'accident'. I thought you would recover a little quicker. I think you deserved that much more."</p> <p>He pressed a finger to her lips. "It really wasn't hard," he said. "I'm glad. Thank you."</p> <p>"You really mean it," she replied. "You really meant it. Don't stop."</p> <p>"Well, your eyes," he said as he brushed her cheek with his thumb.</p> <p>"Yeah," she replied. "I mean your eyes. I haven't been able to stop smiling ever since. It's amazing."</p> <p>"Well, it looks like I do. The little thing on your leg really bothers you."</p> <p>"I'm glad. I never knew people didn't get so excited to watch 'Aquaman'." He laughed and leaned in to kiss up her neck. "You always were pretty good at that."</p> <p>"I should get out of the way."</p> <p>"No, you don't need to be, let's just get this mess cleaned up."</p> <p>"Why?" she asked.</p> <p>He grabbed his shirt and started pulling as he walked to the door. "Don't be crazy, it's your last chance."</p> <p>She got up and walked with him to the exit to get into the car. "I never said that you could quit," she said as she turned around, "I'm not like that."</p> <p>He laughed and kissed the top of her head as he got in the car, pulling away from the curb. "Yeah, you're not like that, and when you are, I'm not gonna laugh."</p> <p>She started to laugh. "Awww, we'll get over this. Now let me call my parents and tell them my parents are picking me up from here."</p> <p>"That sounds like fun."</p> <p>"They were surprised."</p> <p>"Yeah, me too, but I didn't know it then."</p> <p>"I don't know how to say this, but you do have an amazing body."</p> <p>She laughed as she looked around. "I know. That's why you're so interested."</p> <p>"Well, you have a very beautiful body, and I really appreciate you being attracted to me."</p> <p>Her cheeks flushed while breathing heavily. "You're so sweet, and I'm happy you feel the same way."</p> <p>"I just thought you and I would feel so comfortable around each other."</p> <p>"Well, we don't just feel comfortable around anyone," she retorted quickly. "If I had known you were so interested in my body, I would have asked you to touch me, in return."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"I mean, no, of course you wouldn't be able to do that," she said nervously. "I could die from embarrassment with out even touching you."</p> <p>"That's not it at all, it's nothing at all," he replied as his palms began to sweat a little. "Besides, it's a little awkward."</p> <p>"I'm afraid of that," she replied smiling. "I'm not that comfortable touching you."</p> <p>"Well, maybe you better call your parents right now. It's just a meeting," he said quickly. "I'm not even sure why I told you to call."</p> <p>"You can tell me."</p> <p>"Okay, I'll call them, but no more questions," he replied. He was now sweating profusely again but it didn't bother her at all.</p> <p>"I just wanted to let you know to expect an answer on their end," she replied as she pulled away.</p> <p>"That's not it at all," he replied as he pulled into a parking place that had a few other things they would need to do for the next couple days. "This was the best thing I've done with my life up until now."</p> <p>"I'm sure we will, but I have some things of mine to do first," she added as she pulled out of the parking lot.</p> <p>"Well, I hope to see you at the meeting tomorrow," he said as he started walking towards his carâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
