I nod and let her lead me.</p> <p>There's a bed in one side of the room with the nightstand next to it. She lies on it. It's a small one; it's just right. I'm still getting used to being on the floor, of being bound and of feeling my legs being opened wide, and of being on my hands and knees or in my ass, and being spread wide apart, and of being a woman.</p> <p>'I don't think I could let you fuck me,' I protest nervously.</p> <p>'But I'm still your woman,' she answers me. 'I'm going to use you, now.'</p> <p>My heart beats faster, the blood pumping in my ears.</p> <p>'You'll love me,' she promises and then gets up from the bed. She comes up behind me and starts rubbing my ass. 'Maybe you'll like having your ass fucked,' she asks.</p> <p>'Fuck you,' I say quietly, feeling like I might start to cry.</p> <p>'And maybe you'll like having your ass fucked too, I think you deserve it, don't you?' she says with a laugh. I just lie there.</p> <p>She starts to put some lube on her finger.</p> <p>'Hold out, you can get used to this,' she says, and then tells me that she's just going to push it in. So I start to count and as she works it in, and then she begins to fuck me with it, slowly and steadily. My face is turning bright red; it feels so nice. But it's all that I can do. I don't want to do anything that will make it worse.</p> <p>'Are you ready for it?' she asks as she continues to fuck me with her finger.</p> <p>'I'm already ready for it, thank you,' I tell her.</p> <p>She smiles. I'm crying so much that there's tears in my eyes. It feels so weird to be saying this, even though I know it to be true. Her finger is still moving as she fucks me, and her hand is slick as she slides three fingers in. At last she removes her hand and gives me a dirty grin.</p> <p>She grabs my hair and pulls it roughly with a snap. She is now stroking her cock that has grown hard as she thrusts into me, then I feel it. I feel something wet and smooth being worked between my butt cheeks.</p> <p>'Don't make me do that,' I tell her, but I think I will be persuaded. She spreads my ass with a finger and rubs the wetness between my cheeks again. Again she rubs me, and it gets nice and wet, and she pulls my cock as far as she can spread it, then she puts it up to my hole.</p> <p>I gasp as I feel that. The pressure is incredible.</p> <p>Without warning she pushes it all the way in and starts working the cock in me, and I feel the cold and cold, hard thing again, and as a woman does, it feels nice.</p> <p>'You feel so good in there,' she says. 'Can you feel me fucking your ass?' she asks. 'It feels so good. Are you ready for me to have my cock up your ass?'</p> <p>It feels like nothing I've ever experienced.</p> <p>'I'm gonna be your baby,' I tell myself, and as she starts to fuck me, I try to imagine that my body is some kind of monster, a dildo, a huge thing that I can't wrap my hands around. Then I find myself wishing that it were that.</p> <p>'You're going to be our baby now,' she promises.</p> <p>'Yes, I'm going to be yours, I'll do anything you want to do to me,' I say in a desperate tone.</p> <p>We both groan as it all gets carried away. I can feel myself going from empty to full soon.</p> <p>At last she pulls out, and tells me that I have to do exactly as she says, 'and keep it there until I tell you to stop.' I hear her laughing as she turns to look at me.</p> <p>'Come here, now,' she commands.</p> <p>'Oh yes, please do,' I cry, my body shuddering.</p> <p>'Don't try to keep it from me. You don't have to do anything except let it happen. Do it now.'</p> <p>I'm trembling from the thought of what she intends to do, but as I do as she said, I start to feel the tension, the need, the pain. I start to shake, and I start to whimper. She's a good little girl.</p> <p>'Please, please, let me do it, please!' I beg.</p> <p>'Hush, now,' she murmurs. 'Be quietâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
