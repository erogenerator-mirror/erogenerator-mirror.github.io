He felt her hot lips on his ears and felt her fingernails tracing the length of the crease in his cheekbones, the small indentation of his lower lip. He leaned his head back and she moved her mouth away from his ear, looking to see if he was still able to speak.</p> <p>"Suck"</p> <p>She took his ear in her small hand and flicked her tongue across it.</p> <p>"Suck it, slave," he said, and she took the ear into her mouth.</p> <p>"Suck me" he said again.</p> <p>She placed her tongue into the cavity of his ear, and pulled it back out, licking and sucking the skin into her mouth, then pressing her nose firmly against the back of his ear and pressing her chin against his lips. She repeated her motion over and over. She kept her teeth pressed against the top of his ear, and he felt like he might be able to go insane at that.</p> <p>She moved her tongue from side to side over and over again. The soft fabric against his ears felt like velvet against his body. He felt his skin quiver and her lips touch the base of his neck. They felt like they were kissing a thick, throbbing prick.</p> <p>"Suck"</p> <p>She repeated the process on his ear, then slid her tongue against his cheek, then his body, moving slowly. He felt so good, so beautiful. He reached up and grabbed her hair a little, pulling it back. He felt the back of her head against his chest as he leaned back against the wall, feeling her tongue press softly against the skin that had been exposed. He felt the pressure of her hair against his skin and he felt as his body tensed and relaxed. He pulled her to him, pressing his tongue to her throat.</p> <p>"Suck," he said again, pulling her head even closer. He felt her hands on his head, and he felt as he felt the tips of her fingers press hard into the back of his hair...</p> <p>She could just taste the saltiness of his skin as she let him go, breathing into his ear.</p> <p>"I have a very special reward for you," she said, her voice a whisper. He felt it against his ear, and she pressed down, the tip of his nose. He felt the soft flesh of her shoulder... a soft, small bump...</p> <p>"Please, Sir..." he said. He felt as she took a deep breath as her forehead grazed up against his temple and he felt her nose press ever harder against his neck.</p> <p>"Lick... please" he said, leaning against her and taking her chin gently in his hand. He pressed her face back to him, the tip of her tongue licking the nape of his neck, then sliding into the small hollow of his throat. She pulled her head back, still on his shoulder, and pressed her lips firmly to his, but with more control, and her tongue slid slowly against his. She slid her tongue over the soft, cool flesh of his neck and he felt himself relax in her arms, taking in the sensation in his body.</p> <p>He felt her move her body, pressing against his hard dick and she pressed her thigh against his and his hands slid to the small of her back. He felt her leg slide around him, her leg rubbing gently against his cock. He was so hard, and his arms felt so big around her. He could feel himself pressed against her body, felt himself pressing on her, and he lifted her body off the wall and his lips returned to hers, a quick kiss against his lips, then a quick one between their lips.</p> <p>He pulled back from her, holding her hand, and looked down to see her lips, pink, wet, trembling. He bent down to kiss her again, then turned to face her fully. She leaned against him and felt his tongue slide along his lips, tasting him, tasting her. She felt his arms slip around her as he kissed her, his hands roaming over her body as he kissed her. He gently pulled back, looked deep into her eyes and kissed her eyelids, then kissed her mouth again, trailing a line of hot kisses down her throat. She smelled like mint, a soft, floral fragrance, a small scent that was not all that different from his.</p> <p>He leaned his shoulders to rest her body against his as he reached around to cup one full globe of her breast, the erect nipple pressing harder against his skin. He felt himself pressing against her as he kissed her again, his lips grazing hers, then his tongue sliding out to taste hers again, a little stronger this time.</p> <p>She moaned softly into his mouth as he traced the length of her jaw with his tongue, then slid his tongue downâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
