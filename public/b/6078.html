I would have stayed forever. I remember how she was with all the other girls in the locker room. It took me by the end of high school to remember her. Now I just couldn't help but admire her. She had her blonde hair up in a pony tail and in those sexy tight shorts she was wearing looked really fantastic. Her breasts were ample and firm. The bikini top barely contained them and even without her bra she looked stunning. She looked at me and smiled.</p> <p>"I was hoping that you would come today," she said. "It was really exciting to hear all the comments from the football team. And you were such a sweet and nice guy to help out a lady."</p> <p>"My sister is my best friend," I responded to her statement.</p> <p>I was thinking that she wasn't telling the truth. She told me that she was in fact an extra year junior, so I couldn't be mad. "So this year we'll be attending the senior reunion." I replied.</p> <p>"Well I suppose I should have thought that by now," she said with a smirk. "Do you really like me?" she asked.</p> <p>I smiled at her and answered, "I like you, much more than I know how to say."</p> <p>We were still talking until we decided to change our plans for the evening.</p> <p>*********</p> <p>As we climbed onto the bus, I was nervous to say anything to her but at the same time thrilled. After all my dreams had been dashed and I couldn't take this chance. My sister's friends had asked me to do anything for them. It seemed they were all so excited to be attending a formal occasion with a group of women we knew. Now she was about to embark to the reunion.</p> <p>It turns out to be a special place we went. One of the last people here we were told. Some people were already gathered. I had assumed it to be somewhere in Boston or New York.</p> <p>The reunion was in the city and there were many people there. All of the girls and all of their friends were there. The room was filled with a variety of interesting people. There were several men and women and many other couples dancing in groups. Many couples were going down on each other.</p> <p>All the couples who knew us said we was the best thing that ever happened to be there. I was the shy kind of guy. It was hard for me to go out with people who were so obviously attracted to me. But it didn't stop me from trying. Some of the girls and other men even wanted to go with me to the wedding, but I knew that wasn't right. I didn't want to seem like a pervert but some of the men were still attracted to me.</p> <p>The last group of guys left soon after us. My sister looked at me and said, "They will be here again soon."</p> <p>Well I knew she meant it. "So we shall," I responded.</p> <p>After the reunion there was only a little while left when everything started getting crowded. There were a lot of guys around so I knew I was more than welcome to sit among them. I found that being seated in the middle between my sister and her friend was really relaxing. It was also really nice dancing with these people since it had been the last dance that I was dancing with in my lifetime when I had to put out for a living.</p> <p>We danced a few songs and left the bar. I made it to the door at 3:00 am and just stood there looking around at all the people that were dancing next to me. I couldn't believe I had come here to have sex with my sister. Her friends, and even her parents, were there. The girls weren't alone.</p> <p>The group of guys we had stayed behind had gathered just behind me. It looked like a group with all three of them. They had the chairs around the dance floor pushed up against the walls with the lights on. There was no one inside. I sat down in the chair and waited for them to come over and sit on my lap. But when none were in front of me, I leaned forward and kissed her.</p> <p>She immediately pushed me up against the wall so I was resting on my right side. I felt her hands go around to my back to hold me as her friend kissed my neck slowly. I could feel her body grinding into me with my back turned to the wall. My sister was wearing just a blouse and she was holding on to me as another guy slid up against her. Her friend was wearing a tank top with nothing but a pair of string bikini bottoms. My sister leaned back and we started making out again. I felt her hand caressing my thigh and it became hard to focus when someone else moved behind us and started taking offâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
