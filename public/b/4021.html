Please don't...don't...," she screamed. She pushed him hard against the wall; the wall had a long, thin cord attached to it—to just about his neck right above his ears. It was long enough to hold all of Sam's body weight down at the same time—and it was still at least four inches short. As the cord bit into his neck, it pulled it out a few inches from his neck—and it tugged at the cords on either side of his neck to pull them up and out.</p> <p>The feeling was agonizing.</p> <p>The moment Sam felt the cord tugged, it pulled his mouth wide open. The only thing that could keep his lips together was his nose; and as his mouth was so wide open for this thing, Sam had no idea that the nose could be pulled open. He only knew that as the cords pulled his mouth open, the sound of a scream ripped through his mouth.</p> <p>"Oh god oh god."</p> <p>It was an intense and painful feeling. Sam could feel his nose being tugged, stretched, pulled—as his nose was pulled away from his mouth by the string. And as his mouth was pulled, Sam could feel the pressure of the bow pulling through, forcing the gag back in. Tears streamed down his cheeks—it hurt; it hurt so good.</p> <p>The thought that he was in some kind of a bad deal—as much as he hated this part of the experience—it had actually gotten him through all of this. He wasn't in a terrible deal, but he had been in the worst deal of all. Sam had heard him and knew that it had been an unfair thing. He had been on his own for so long; he hadn't had the opportunity to make a decision and he had been forced to have done.</p> <p>"Stop," he cried and pulled his mouth away from the cord. The gag pushed against his throat.</p> <p>"I'm sorry."</p> <p>Sam knew he was in trouble, but he had to figure out what the hell that was.</p> <p>"No. . .please."</p> <p>Sam cried out that again, but he could not help the tears at the corners of his eyes, and the tears that kept falling and falling. He could not believe what was happening to him. Everything was spinning around him.</p> <p>His eyes were bright. And he could see that he was crying.</p> <p>Sam felt like someone had turned the light on in his head for a few seconds. If he had a light on it, he surely didn't know what was going on under his eyes.</p> <p>Sam did not look at the person in front of him. His eyes kept returning to the red ropes wrapped around his wrists and wrists. They were still in place. When they came close to his hands, he knew that they were there; his hands were still there. And again, in that same moment, those thoughts of the ropes were gone.</p> <p>Sam's hands were still bound on the rope. He was not moving at all and his right hand was still hanging on the bottom of the bed.</p> <p>He shook his head and closed his eyes. He did not want to believe anymore. He had felt that pressure in his hands—and now that pressure was back in his mouth. That had been the last thing he could have done to escape from this reality.</p> <p>His tears dried his tears; his nose burned in the pain, and his jaw and hands were sore. He felt like he had been in a really bad deal. That he was so totally fucked when he realized that he had been in a bad deal.</p> <p>Sam's mouth was dry and he could feel that his throat was getting sore. His mouth had a bit of dried slime on it, and he was getting a good amount in. He could smell it—and it made his whole body smell like soap.</p> <p>He had expected some kind of punishment for this, and more than anything else, he felt guilty that he had been so much worse. But that thought passed without any further thought.</p> <p>"Sam. . .Sam. . .Sam," he said. "Let me go."</p> <p>Sam heard the sharp sounds of a cane hitting a tree. There was something else in his mind—an energy and awareness.</p> <p>"Sam! Sam!" he heard a male voice say. It was familiar. Sam could understand it. But for some reason, it reminded him of the same teacher of his life—and that reminded him of what he had been through.</p> <p>Suddenly, Sam got himself together and began to sit up. If she was still there, then this was no worse than it had been. Sam's hands were numb from the cord biting into them and the weight of the knot in his collar; they were in no way better shape because they were tied at the wrists, not to a rope.</p> <p>"Sam, what the fuck—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
