She smiled pleasantly at him and pulled him in for a kiss, then quickly pulled off her top. "I was just hoping for some company, my beautiful man." She dropped her shorts, and straddled him, lowering herself onto his face. He reached out to caress her breasts, rolling the nipples between his fingers gently.</p> <p>"Ahhn, my beautiful man. You're driving me wild, baby," she said softly.</p> <p>"I'm just enjoying the moment. You have beautiful tits," he said. She giggled as she kissed him back, moving herself onto him, straddling him.</p> <p>"I have wonderful tits. I want to hold them and feel them," she said as he lifted her tits to his lips. She smiled happily at him, lowering herself onto him, feeling his hardness pushing into her. She lowered herself onto him, moving them both onto the bed. She moved herself until they were once again face to face, then sat up.</p> <p>"This is the end of fun," she said. "Now I'm going lie down on my back, and enjoy the night!"</p> <p>"It's been a long day," hissed, "but I think you enjoyed it as much as I did," and he reached up to caress her breasts, running his fingers through her nipples.</p> <p>"It's certainly good to be able to go like this!" she exclaimed, pulling his face to hers to kiss him and then moving to straddle his body. She pulled his shorts and tank top off, and then sat back on his crotch, feeling his stiff cock.</p> <p>"Ahhn, you have a great cock," she told him as she lifted herself up slightly, then moved her pussy down onto his cock. "Ahhn, you get so hard when you do this, darling," she said as she lowered herself onto him.</p> <p>She wrapped her legs tight around his hips, and began moving up and down on his cock. He ran his hands over her breasts as she used her tight pussy to rub herself on him. She continued moving up and down on him, moaning with his cock between her lips, and he ran his fingers through her hair as she continued. He loved having this beautiful woman sitting on his cock. She smiled, and smiled back at himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
