The sexual energy flowed between us and she never failed to make me as horny as I currently was. The more we made eye contact, the more she took off her clothes, revealing a body that I had only seen in one of those sex magazines. Her eyes widened when she saw what I was staring at again, and her lips formed a tiny 'mm' as she did so.</p> <p>"I can't believe how sexy you are" I whispered, my voice coming out shaky and hoarse. As her eyes focused on my raging manhood, I knew it was only a matter of time before I found myself with a beautiful woman standing in the doorway. With my heart pounding in my ears, my lips forming a tight 'o' and my heart racing so fast, I almost thought I was going to explode.</p> <p>"You are so beautiful" I mumbled, my head swooning from the overwhelming attention my voice could generate. She stepped to me in silence, her eyes glancing at my throbbing flesh, before she stood up and took me in her arms. I almost melted when she placed her arms around me and hugged me tight. I could feel how excited she'd become under my arms and it sent electricity through my body, sending chills down my spine. I had never been with a woman so close before and I knew I hadn't ever been in a sexual situation that could have gotten me that excited again.</p> <p>"You look so good baby. I've wanted you from day one." She whispered as she wrapped her arms around my neck.</p> <p>"I never told you my name?" I asked, still on shaky legs.</p> <p>"No baby, I didn't know that you wanted to have another woman...." she whispered, tracing her fingers along my cheeks as she pulled me closer to her. I couldn't help myself anymore now. I couldn't tell her that our relationship was purely sexual, just something we needed to do. It was now or never, "I want this, I need this", I decided before my brain could continue to function normally. "I know you need this, so let's make it happen."</p> <p>"I don't know if I'll get enough...I've never had sex before"</p> <p>"Oh don't worry about it, just do it. I'm not going to force you to do anything you don't want to do, just trust me"</p> <p>"You are the biggest tease on earth and I don't know why you won't just take advantage of me. I'm not a slut though, I don't see why you think I would do anything but let you do it." I said laughing, but also feeling a little silly since she had told me what she liked and also wanted to do it....I told her I was more than a little turned on at the idea of it, and she smiled as she released me from her arms and stepped away from me to embrace my shoulders.</p> <p>"I'm more than a little turned on baby, you should take everything off baby"</p> <p>"I'll take care of everything" I added, giving her my best smile, feeling the heat begin to rise in my stomach as she leaned into me again. It took all of my self control, not to let her kiss me on the top of the head. A soft sound escaped her lips then as they were pushed into my ear. My hand came up and brushed a strand of her hair from her face. Our lips met, a gentle peck followed by a longer one. We kept our lips locked for as long as we could until my hand drifted from her lips along her jawline and found the small bite marks where her shirt had been in my excitement....</p> <p>"I think your shirt has come off". That was all she said before she broke away and stepped back to let my shirt fall free. I raised my arms to take the shirt off, revealing my body to a new light. I felt the cool air on my skin as she stepped in front of me and took in my body. She stood in front of me and looked me up and down, taking in all the different sizes and styles. She slowly took my arms out of the sleeves, sliding them up my arms. I was a little nervous about exposing my body to her, and felt like she didn't want to hurt me. Her hands went to my shoulders and slowly slipped the sleeves of my shirt off. My skin felt soft as she pulled the shirt over my head, leaving me clad in only my bra. It was only when I felt the cold air caress my body did I stop her.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done that...but you are so sexy!" I managed in a small voice as I closed my eyes in shame.</p> <p>"Don't worry, it's OK for meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
