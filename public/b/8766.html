As the second song ended she looked up at the clock but as it was 11:30, her own song was on the stereo. She started to get up but her legs were still weak, the new position did not help. She slipped off the couch and slipped off her flip flops. Then she grabbed her shirt so she could put it on but she quickly pulled the blouse back down. Then she stepped out of her jeans and t-shirt and sat down in the armchair at the table.</p> <p>As her friend sat there watching a video, Kim had her eyes glued to the screen as two guys got their brains blown out by another girl. Then as the girl on the screen finished, the sound player started to play. A few minutes later her friend arrived back from the kitchen and said she was running late. Then Kim looked over at Kyle and said, "He's asleep now, is it OK if I wait him for a few minutes? I promise I'll be back in a minute." The two of them got up and walked over to the couch as Kyle went off to change.</p> <p>As Kim put on her flip-flops and her flip flops, she asked, "Can he move around a bit?" Kyle said that he could.</p> <p>Kim stood by the couch for another few minutes and then said she needed a minute or two. She sat down on the couch again and put her flip flop on her lap. She reached inside her bag again and got Kyle another bottle of wine when she realized she actually missed her glass because she was not on a nightshirt.</p> <p>Kyle came back with a glass and sat down next to Kim in her other chair. He said, "I never realized how hard it is to drink wine. I think we should get to know each other some more."</p> <p>Kim said, "The wine is fine if you want some more. What about you?"</p> <p>Kyle said, "Thanks for talking to me. It has been an intense summer and we were both a little afraid of the world. That and I had to take a small vacation to someplace to work."</p> <p>Kim said, "Well I need you to know, this doesn't come off as a 'little' vacation, but we'll be back next Tuesday for a long session of sex."</p> <p>Kyle smiled and said, "That sounds fair as long as we don't stop at one."</p> <p>Kim just laughed and said, "Yeah, you have no problem with us having sex," They finished their drinks and went back to the living room for a smoke as the girls talked and drank.</p> <p>When they got back to the living room, Kyle made sure they were in position when he walked back up with two mugs for their beers. He also made sure they were still there when he got back. The three talked and giggled like teenagers until Kyle said she was starting to get drunk. Kim giggled so they sat down with their beers and shared more weed.</p> <p>Kim said, "So how do you sleep?" Kyle said he had to do a little work with the dishes and then he would tell her what he needed to do.</p> <p>Kim said, "I was a little fuzzy around the end." Kyle said it was just the beer but it helped with the dryer.</p> <p>"That's good," Kim said, "After our fourth beer we were still a little buzzed and the more weed we had the less we were thinking about how good our last session of sex was."</p> <p>Kim asked, "What made you think you were going to get any sleep?" Kyle said he saw it as a sign that Kim was telling the truth.</p> <p>Kim said, "We were thinking what we should do in bed. I've been so good to you and the other guys and I want to repay you." Then she said.</p> <p>Kyle said, "Oh this sounds like the kind of revenge that you want." Then he asked, "Why do you want to be revenge on me?"</p> <p>Kim said, "Oh I don't know. I've just been really hot for you since I saw these pictures on the Internet."</p> <p>Kyle said, "Well you'll just have to get even hotter." Then he said, "So how does it feel to be with two guys?"</p> <p>Kim said, "I thought it was great sex but now we know how it really feels. That's partly it and partly it's all the drugs and alcohol. It feels great being with two men but the sex was great."</p> <p>Kyle said, "Well if you'd like to get even more hot it's free. You can make a deal with me." He asked if they both wanted to go to bed with him orâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
