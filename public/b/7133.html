And this way if I decide to go all the way?"</p> <p>"I know you don't take the lead with me right now, honey. I need to focus on what you are doing. I need to be more specific, so you really need to answer the question. Do you want to be my little slut? I don't know for sure, but let's just chalk it up to the right answer and go on with our lives."</p> <p>"You mean to tell me you are asking me to be your little slut?!?! It is crazy! You are fucking insane!" she yelled. "You make me so fucking insane!"</p> <p>He chuckled. "Well, it is crazy, too. I don't know for sure why you still have a choice, though. You are such a fuck-toy. And all you have to do is tell me how much you really want to be my little bitch!"</p> <p>He moved and kissed her hard on the cheek.</p> <p>"I won't take your virginity and it will still be your last time!" he said in a playful voice.</p> <p>He slowly turned her around and helped her down on the bench. She leaned back against the bench and they both stood up with him on his knees behind her kissing her deeply on the neck while he massaged her breasts with one hand.</p> <p>"God, are you so hard? You are, aren't you," she whispered to him between breaths.</p> <p>"Yeah, I am. I still have a job to do. Now are you ready? There is still time for you to go home."</p> <p>They both went around the desk, and kissed again for a while. As he pulled her blouse back up on her shoulders and kissed her again for a while, she reached behind her and unhooked her bra, throwing it in the direction of the desk. She tossed the bra to the side and stepped out of her panties, placing them next to her clothes as she leaned against the counter just above the counter and they embraced for another long hot kiss. Her breath was hot and heavy in her mouth as he held her tight. He slowly slid his right hand down to her inner thigh and stroked her inner skin while kissing her. She broke away from his kiss long enough to push him down to the floor with her ass as she fell on top of his body, her breasts squishing into his face as their tongues mingled. She was still wet and he moved between their sweaty bodies and spread her legs even farther apart. She spread her legs even wider.</p> <p>"You are still so tight," he said, "And I still have one surprise for you!"</p> <p>"What? What? What?" she whined.</p> <p>"I brought an overnight bag full of my things. I think we are going to have a lot of sex tonight!" He said huskily, his words sounding sexy and lustful. "Do you want me to carry it all the way to your hotel?" he asked her as he stroked her soft body with one hand.</p> <p>When she turned her head to him, he smiled. "I like your honesty, baby. I do believe you are about to get a surprise."</p> <p>She smiled as she grabbed his belt and pulled him down to her. They kissed and kissed as she reached up under his shirt and undid his pants. As he was taking his shirt off and she unzipped his pants, she took his black boxer-briefs off and threw them in the desk. They held each other as they kissed. She moved down his body, still squeezing and pinching his nipples under her fingers.</p> <p>"There, now you are completely naked and I can see every little detail of what you are going to feel when I take you," he said huskily.</p> <p>She grabbed his cock and licked through all around it as she looked up into his eyes. She kissed his balls and the inside of his legs, then continued on down to his cock. She took hold and stroked him quickly, causing him to moan as she squeezed his balls hard. She took his cock in her hand and started to stroke him while keeping a tight grip on the head of his cock. His moans increased in frequency as she increased the pace and started to suck more of his cock into her hot mouth. He thrust his pelvis upwards towards her and she took his whole hard cock in her mouth. She felt as if it was sliding deep inside her throat as her tongue ran along the underside of his penis. His cock felt like she never had it in her mouth. She felt his hands grasp her hair and she stopped her hand movements to make sure he did not cum in her mouth. Her hand kept moving up and down on his wetness as her other hand ran up and down his shaft.
