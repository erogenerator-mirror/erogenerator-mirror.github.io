Within a few seconds, she started a stringy-looking orgasm with her head thrown back and her body quivering as an intense orgasm ripped through her loins. She felt her thighs squeeze tightly around his head, but his arms seemed to be holding her lower.</p> <p>"Ahhhh..." she heard him sigh as his head went back with a satisfied grin as it settled back on her sex. "I always knew you were good!" he said with a grin as he began licking her from her clit back into the core of her womanhood.</p> <p>With his tongue inside her, his hands had cupped her ass cheeks and she heard the occasional slap as he hit her. She closed her eyes and could feel his fingers playing with her anus as his tongue circled her clit. For a few moments, it was as if they were playing a game of catch; he would bring one of her legs over his shoulder and then, with his mouth, she could feel him slide four fingers inside her and thrust them in and out for a few minutes. She loved anal, but she found that the experience was almost as intense, if not as fun in-between, as the pleasure she felt when he tongue-fucked her.</p> <p>She heard the sound of the bedspring creak as her husband's fingers penetrated her again, but she didn't care. She never even considered stopping if he said no. She could not imagine that she could even imagine that she would be on her knees on the bed, her legs either side of her husbands head so that he could eat her out whenever he wished. But she never felt that she would have any control over when he would put his tongue inside her. They were only moments away when he brought his mouth down and his tongue slid inside, pressing against the inside walls of her pussy lips again as he did so.</p> <p>She loved her husband's tongue-lashing as she felt her body's responses to his manipulations. She had rarely climaxed from anal before. This felt so damn good, especially when her husband got to go down on her ass as he tongued her there. "Oohhhhh, yeeeeeeeessss...," she cooed, "right there...right there...oohhh...ohhh...that's it...right therettt..."</p> <p>As soon as she did, her orgasm started building to a peak within her, almost as intense as the last of her orgasm when she felt his tongue push aside another of her fingers and then slide deep inside her pussy as he thrust it up and down the length of the tunnel where both of her holes were taking up residence. She was on the brink of orgasm one moment, but she held on until she felt his tongue flick her G-spot on its way down below.</p> <p>All of a sudden, she felt a strong hand at her ass as her husband put two and then three fingers inside her, while his tongue began to massage her clit. She moaned a little louder as her legs squeezed about his head tighter than ever. She was feeling sensations unlike anything she had ever felt before, like the feeling of his fingers sliding in and out of her while his tongue rubbed her clit. There was nothing more erotic than a pussy spread wide open, exposed to her husband and the taste of her in his mouth and on his tongue. All she could think of right now was how wonderful it is to have a man licking and pleasuring her in ways that she had no idea existed. She began to moan and breathe faster as her second orgasm continued to build. She could feel it getting closer and closer to the point of no return, and she was loving it.</p> <p>She felt him take her hand and move it to the headboard with his. "Are you comfortable lying on the bed?" he asked.</p> <p>She nodded yes, "Yes."</p> <p>"Do you mind if I move to the bathroom first?" he asked with a grin.</p> <p>"No, just like you had me on the bed," she said with a smile as she got off the bed and turned around, facing him.</p> <p>"Good. I want you to relax and enjoy every moment of this," he said as he began kissing her gently, running his hands all over her body as she remained on her stomach with her head on his chest.</p> <p>She smiled at him, "Is that okay? Are you going to take turns doing what I'm doing to you?" she said.</p> <p>He reached down to the mattress beside him and picked it up, "Do you know how big it is?" he asked.</p> <p>She shook her head "No."</p> <p>He rolled onto his back, "Just enjoy the moment. I love being able to have you in the moment. It feels so awesome."</p> <p>Still on her stomach, she looked upâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
