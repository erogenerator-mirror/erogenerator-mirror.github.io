"So if we had sex you wouldn't have been tempted to let me take her?" I asked.</p> <p>She glanced at my crotch. "Maybe. Maybe it was all you have ever gotten. After all, she looks so good, I was surprised she had a big belly," she said with a little laugh. "She looks so hot with you, and she loves teasing your cock. She even got the idea of playing with your balls...like you do with me, baby?" She smiled. "You need to get cleaned up real quick, I got to go... you'll need to save some energy for the shower."</p> <p>I leaned, then. I felt her hands slip and slip under my shirt. She lifted it up, and I had to fight to keep myself from dropping her onto the floor in the process. In no time at all I'd removed that, and stood there with her holding my shorts, one hand over her mouth to stifle a snort. She tried to laugh and said, "Oh god, I hope you're not coming up with some other idea, my legs are jelly."</p> <p>I laughed and held them open. "No, no, silly." I said, looking down at her face. "I'll keep you safe for the rest of the evening."</p> <p>"But I don't want to be able to walk home any time soon," she said. She pulled up her shirt, but I didn't reach down to help her. Instead I stood there, holding her, with a hand on her breast. She held my hand tight, and held on to the back of my head. Her legs opened, giving her room to sit down. I leaned over and kissed her, and she moaned her pleasure. As we kissed, I felt her hand slip lower, pressing against my crotch. My cock lurched in her hand.</p> <p>"We have to get out," I said.</p> <p>"Let's go," she said. She stood and I took her hand, and helped her out of the bathroom, with a little difficulty. She wrapped the towel around herself, and we walked toward my room. As we reached the bed, she took my hand, and led me inside. I sat on the bed, and we both stripped off the clothes we had been wearing. I looked over at what was now just a plain white bra, and the tight, low cut top that was barely covering her tits. We got back to the bed and she sat down. I was looking at her, and she was looking at herself on the bed. What a beauty. She stood, facing away from me, and she looked down into my eyes, her hands on her hips. Her eyes flirtingly sparkled. "I don't want to ruin my surprise," she said, and I smiled. Her ass glowed in the morning light. "You look beautiful, baby."</p> <p>That's exactly what I had. "I can't believe how lucky I am. You're gorgeous, and you look great, too." She had stopped at the mirror. She was still wearing her shirt, but the straps were gone, exposing the tops of both her breasts.</p> <p>"Your surprise is just for your eyes!" she said. She was standing there, watching my eyes, not noticing that her nipples were hard and hard.</p> <p>I grinned. "You're really turning me on, Angel."</p> <p>She laughed. I started to sit up, when she stopped me. "Let me, please." And she knelt, pulled down my boxers—nervously, and with shaking fingers—and took my cock in both hands. She licked my tip, then slid her tongue across my head and slid my whole dick inside of her. I gasped at the feeling of her tongue on my whole shaft. "It's just like sucking a cock," I said, in awe of the sensation. My dick in her hand felt so good inside of her, and I knew how good I really was going to love it.</p> <p>She continued, slowly and softly, kissing the head of my dick, then taking it in her mouth all the way to the back of her throat. I moaned and groaned. She was really getting off on this. I had never been with a woman while having a girl suck my dick before. "Please don't stop, Angie." I said.</p> <p>She kept her eyes locked on me as she worked me into her mouth. I don't think the sight made me cum. I felt my knees go weak. I started to feel guilty about what I was doing, but even as I was fighting it, there was something else I wanted to do to her. "You're driving me crazy," I said, "I've been thinking about what you would like, and I just got out and wanted to do it. It looks a lot like what you and—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
