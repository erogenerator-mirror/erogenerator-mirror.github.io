We can go and sit."</p> <p>"No, not yet. My office, that's the main one. No one will be standing around all by themselves, so you might get some privacy."</p> <p>"Great! Well the phone is on my desk too," he replied</p> <p>We both found an empty booth and sat down. Michelle started talking, I read the story in the paper and it hit me that Michelle got off that way. She obviously felt the same way from us, so she must have read it as well. We started with some history and my questions. I began by talking about the events in our lives.</p> <p>"OK, so how did you meet Tom so easily? When I first met him, I thought it was just me, but there's no need for me to tell you this because you won't understand. He made it with me before we were married. We did everything together, and that was the only time we ever had sex. He always made sure of what I wanted, and didn't take a chance. Well anyway, I got pregnant with him when we got married, and the two of us are now married now."</p> <p>"Why didn't you get pregnant before we met?"</p> <p>"If I was to tell you about it, and it would have kept you from getting pregnant until now, you would have been afraid you could be carrying another child."</p> <p>"When we were married, he always just kept pushing me down to where I needed to go for my job and where I didn't have to worry about finding someone to do that work."</p> <p>"Why didn't you go for your job job because my job was done on my own, and not my friend?"</p> <p>"Because I'm pregnant and you're the husband. I've seen more than enough of you. I just didn't feel like I had to tell you the truth about where I live, and my job that's to keep the baby. So, you are the one that doesn't have to know any details, it's best if you stay out of the business for as long as it's safe."</p> <p>"OK, OK, I understand. We'll see if I can get you in, but until then, just let me know, and I'll come back later to tell you."</p> <p>"OK. I'll think about it for the next six months."</p> <p>It took about four months to settle into my life again. We did a lot of things with him, but when we were in the relationship, we just acted like we were doing sex with each other. So we ended up having sex almost every day. We found out that some of the things we did had other meaning than sex and that was the reason we never did it with each other again. The only reason you had sex with Tom while married was because he was with your husband.</p> <p>We talked about moving away from the house, and things with Tom. I told her that it would be nice to do this again and again.</p> <p>"I'm serious, I don't intend to stay with you. I am not going to let it happen again."</p> <p>"Oh, I know. I just feel bad now so I'll let it happen again but it always feels good to know I'm the man."</p> <p>I guess that the two of us went back to the original way that we started out. We talked about my job at the same time because while we were talking. I had told her I worked as a computer programmer, so she knew I did all sorts of stuff like the ones on the web.</p> <p>Michelle took the second half of the story and started to get up, "I'll go with ya then."</p> <p>"No, go ahead, I don't mind. Do you think it would be ok, if we had sex again?"</p> <p>"Of course, it would always be ok."</p> <p>The next day, Michelle started to get up again. "Tom never asks me to do anything like that. I just know that it's always Ok. In fact, I think he might like it."</p> <p>I was just getting back into the swing of things.</p> <p>"Okay, I know it looks like this, but I don't want to think like Mom and you think. We both know that it's never Ok that anything happens between me and you, but it will always be ok."</p> <p>"You know what I mean. I'll get him up for breakfast in a couple of hours."</p> <p>"No, no, that's OK."</p> <p>The next day was about nine o'clock. I knew I had to get there as early as I could. It had been a couple of hours since I had gotten up, and Michelle's hair was in place but she stillâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
