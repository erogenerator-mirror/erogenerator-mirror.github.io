I begged, not needing to even ask. "God, please."</p> <p>He laughed, making me so sore and tender inside that I didn't think that I'd ever recover. I was glad this had finally happened. The look on the face of the other men in the store I knew were shocked, shocked, shocked. I couldn't see the expression on the face of the man seated next to me.</p> <p>"Well, if you're going to be mine," he said. "And by the looks on your faces and the way you're shaking," he chuckled, "I'll give you just what you've asked for! Just think, you'll be begging me for the chance to spend my time fucking you, don't you think? You want to be my slut. I can't do it, but I've had the privilege of finally breaking you in."</p> <p>Even as he spoke, I was surprised how sincere he seemed.</p> <p>"I could do that." I said, trying to lighten the sting of disappointment.</p> <p>The three men around the other side of me smiled a knowing smile as they watched. I couldn't believe that I had a hot guy in my face that wanted my cock so much that he'd go back to the men and buy it. A thought crept into my mind of how if I left here with him now, I'd make him go home, never mention it again.</p> <p>"It'll be fun," my friend said. "You'll need a lot more practice than usual to handle that."</p> <p>"Yeah?" I thought. The two men laughed.</p> <p>***</p> <p>I was lying on the floor, my hands bound above my head. A gag was strapped over my mouth. A ball gag was strapped to my head and I was standing with my hands in front of me. The man behind the bar, whose clothes I had put on over the last few days, stood in front of the two men. He wasn't as handsome as any of them. He was thin and he was wearing dark glasses. He had a large, soft, pale face that was filled with a mischievous grin. He wasn't looking at me, though, he was looking around the store.</p> <p>He took my hand and pulled me onto his arm. I was lying on the floor of a sex shop. I couldn't tell you what was on the floor, though. Most of the places where I was was just booths with the doors open and things to come in. I felt like a slut that way and I really liked being that way. He kissed my palm and I sighed as he rubbed my face in his palm.</p> <p>"Your friend was wondering if you'd like to make him suck your cock," he said. "Or perhaps he can wait until you're ready. It's been a while for both of us." He leaned down and took my left nipple between his lips.</p> <p>I moaned as his tongue circled the nipple and he flicked it playfully.</p> <p>"I think we'll start that with me," he said. He took my hands and pulled me to his lap. His eyes were intense, but his smile wasn't the only thing different.</p> <p>The man next to me had already stripped and was standing by his side as he sat down. His hand was between his legs. I felt his cock twitch a little and I looked at his face to see if he was turned on. He smiled.</p> <p>"She'll be real nice to suck," my friend said. I nodded and he laughed.</p> <p>"Yeah, I bet she will."</p> <p>***</p> <p>One of the men grabbed my hair and pulled my head up. I felt pain mixed in with the pleasure of feeling his huge hand grip my scalp. With my mouth wide open, I could hardly breathe. When his head hit my tongue, I felt like a little boy being forced down on the head of a big stick, then be shoved back down onto it and up over it and down again. The pain was mixed in with pure pleasure, but felt better when he was rough on me.</p> <p>"You okay, Baby?" he asked as the man behind me shoved my head harder into his crotch. My face was a little sore from the man behind me and my ass wasn't as good as it was when I was face to face with my friend.</p> <p>"Yeah," I replied, my voice still weak. The man had a hand on the back of my head and his other hand was on my neck, roughly and I loved it.</p> <p>Without warning, the man behind my head shoved my face towards the bulge in the man's jeans. I whimpered with the pain in my face from the rough, hard cock being shoved into my mouth. I could feel that the hard, thick rod was throbbing in my mouth and I couldn't think where to stop or enjoy being forced to haveâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
