My wife had ordered a glass of red wine and my wife had picked up a bottle of red.</p> <p>As I walked toward my wife, I paused for a moment.</p> <p>"Would you mind if I used the computer to get us to bed?" I inquired.</p> <p>As we talked, the man asked his wife to get some books. She didn't even turn to look at me.</p> <p>"Just a little background, right? We're friends. You just relax, while I go change."</p> <p>With that, I left the room while my wife went to the door. After a moment's hesitation, she reached for the door handle. When she turned it, she was surprised to find the two men talking in hushed tones. The woman was sitting on the end of the couch between two of the two men. She was facing them, but her head was up between them. I heard two of the men say: "Go back for a minute. You want a drink, don't you?"</p> <p>My wife turned back and said,</p> <p>"OK, that's how we met. I've known it since that night, before I met my husband. But right then, with the alcohol in my system, I was surprised when I realized that this man had just taken off his pants and was stroking his erection. I guess he didn't think he had me in the room."</p> <p>I saw a glazed look in my wife's eyes again, but I didn't say anything. I had my arms clasp and as I walked toward her, I placed a hand on her bare knee. My fingers had not even made it up to her thigh when I got close, because when I stepped close, she pulled her legs apart. This moved my fingertips over her thigh and I just brushed my fingers against her pussy as I passed her.</p> <p>"I bet we can put some money down to see if our spouses can come over next month for some of the same fun."</p> <p>I said "OK, but just for a minute." I grabbed her purse and we walked toward a nearby bar where a bottle of wine was waiting. The man in the leather jacket introduced himself as Ron, and told me what he had in mind. All I needed to do was give him a little tip.</p> <p>I found the bartender and we headed over to the bar. The man and I were in our late twenties and the bartender looked like a younger man. He was in his fifties and he looked good. He was wearing very expensive looking suit and the man also looked like he lived there.</p> <p>We talked about work, and I realized that he was divorced. I also realized that he had two children and when he saw my wife, he just smiled and walked away. He seemed friendly and friendly, like he did on our first date.</p> <p>We had a glass of wine and he asked if everything was OK. Just then, another man came over and asked if my wife had bought him a new suit. He said that it was $600 dollars a pair and that she would be pleased and I could get one of the men to pick it up at that dollar store. I said "That's OK," and he quickly left our table.</p> <p>My wife and the man walked toward the other table, but not my wife. "I don't need a man to pick these up. They're not for me." My wife and I left our table and walked toward the bar.</p> <p>When we entered, we noticed that there were two older men sitting in the chairs across from them. As we got closer, my wife noticed the man's eyes were roaming her body. She smiled and waved at him.</p> <p>We asked for drinks, and I asked Ron if he would like something to drink, when he said, "Just about."</p> <p>I had a look at my wife, and she said,</p> <p>"OK, let's see if our friends are buying up some clothes that I'm not wearing."</p> <p>I took two large drinks from my side table and asked if I could get her a glass of water. The man in the leather suit asked her to stand right in front of him so that he could put a glass or two of water on the table when he put a chair down. She smiled and pointed to the glass he was placing on his glass.</p> <p>I heard the woman in the front say, "Do you have a preference?" She was not talking to my wife, but I could hear her talking to the man as he put a glass of water on the table a couple of rows above her.</p> <p>"I think I have something in mind, but can you get me a couple of glasses of waterâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
