He said, giving me a pouty face. He ran his hands up my thighs, slipping them under my skirt to caress my thighs from my ankles to my bare arse. I tried to pull away from his invading hands but it was useless; I'd been too lost in my own sensations to resist. I'd never been so aroused in my life.</p> <p>I felt a finger press against my opening and then go in. Oh God. It was big! I felt a finger spread me and then slip up against my vaginal opening.</p> <p>It made me squirm in the seat, it felt so incredible, it was so wrong.</p> <p>"I want you!" I finally croaked out. "I want you to take me!" I managed to shout. "I want you to take me!" I pleaded.</p> <p>He pulled a rubber from his pocket. "It's ok, you can take it." He said gently. "It's a bit scary." He continued to rub it as I stared at him. "I've never had anything bigger than a finger inside me before, not that anyone's ever even touched me there."</p> <p>I felt my dress being lifted slightly. He lifted and it fell to my ankles, and then I felt them, pressing at my pussy lips, spreading them apart. It wasn't as big as the two fingers inside me I was feeling inside, but it wasn't far from that. I was already wet down there, but he began to move his fingers in and out. I was in heaven, he knew how to do this.</p> <p>He pulled out his fingers and brought them up to my mouth, my reaction was instinctual. "Do you want me to do this to you?" He asked almost pleadingly.</p> <p>I nodded eagerly. I was loving it!</p> <p>I pushed his fingers up into my mouth and savoured the taste of my juices.</p> <p>"Do you want me to lick your pussy like I want to give you a finger?" He asked me.</p> <p>I nodded again. "Oh God!" I moaned. "I'm fucking close."</p> <p>He put his hand back on the door handle.</p> <p>"You don't need that key, do you?" he asked. "It's on the back of the door."</p> <p>"No", I said, "I need it!"</p> <p>"Then let me take it!" He insisted.</p> <p>I couldn't. I opened my eyes wide in case he found my reaction to him funny.</p> <p>"Come here!" He barked, pushing me up against the wall on my side.</p> <p>As I opened my mouth to protest but he covered my mouth with his, his lips pressed hard against mine. I tasted my sweet cum on his tongue. He kissed me deeply, my body arched with sexual need, my breasts pressed into his chest and my mouth opened to beg him to kiss me. He kissed me with such passion. When his tongue dived inside my mouth it was like a knife, stabbing my tongue. It tasted of me so much I nearly swooned.</p> <p>He slipped his shirt off of his shoulders and dropped it to me, before pulling down my skirt and pushing me so that I was pushed against the glass of the car door. I could feel his erection on my thigh.</p> <p>He undid his trousers and his cock sprang out, hard and throbbing.</p> <p>"Do you want me?" He whispered into my eye. "Do you want me to fuck you like you've never been fucked before?"</p> <p>He ran it up and down my thigh and then pushed it against my pussy lips. I closed my legs tight and moaned against his mouth.</p> <p>"Yes" I moaned again, "please fuck me!"</p> <p>He took my hand and led it around his waist, rubbing his cock at my fingers. Then he guided my hand down to the seat and pushed me down. My pussy was on fire as his cock slid into me.</p> <p>He was so hard, I thought he was going to come as he penetrated me.</p> <p>"Do you want me to give you something?" he asked, still pumping his cock in and out of me. "I can still fuck you, can't I?"</p> <p>I was confused. I wanted him to finish this, I needed this, I needed more.</p> <p>"Yes" I gasped, "please keep fucking me!"</p> <p>"Do you want me to keep fucking you?" He asked again.</p> <p>"Yes!" I groaned. "Yes I want you to keep fucking me!" I whimpered weakly. "Please just fuck me!"</p> <p>He took his hard cock out of me so that he could enter me again from the other side. It hurt to let goâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
