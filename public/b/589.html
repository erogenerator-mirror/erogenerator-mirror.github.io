She yelled at me. "Don't... please-!" and I just pushed a finger into her asshole.</p> <p>My own orgasm was building in my balls as I pushed my finger in further. I saw it in her eyes, I heard it, it made my dick throb and throb. I could see her cum dripping out of her ass and down the crack of her ass. "Oh fuck..." I moaned. "Fuck I'm gonna come."</p> <p>She was going to break up with me.</p> <p>But I held back, and she did break up with me. And I did it. Three, four hard fucking thrusts in the darkness, and I came in her asshole.</p> <p>I went to use the bathroom and wash off. After my head cleared all the cum was sliding down my dick. I got cleaned up, and I went back to the room. And I was there. She was all over me. She was sitting on my lap and I had one knee on either side of her and kissed her. I slid one hand up her shirt to her tit. And I was kissing her neck, then her ear, then my hand. She was shaking, so I slid my hand up and down over her pussy a bit, then I pushed two fingers into her pussy, I found her asshole with a couple of fingers. There was the slightest noise, and she shook. She got off my lap and started undressing, and I started to pull off my clothes too. I got my clothes off and she got a little closer.</p> <p>She told me I had to get back to the room. I kissed her, we kissed some more, we kissed some more, and we got up. She undid her pants and stood in front of me, naked as a newborn. And she walked around to me, leaned over and said, "I want you."</p> <p>I said, "Okay."</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Yes.", and I pushed into her and fucked her, and she said, "No, I don't want you." and I just kept fucking her.</p> <p>We went to our rooms for another night. I'd be back around 7, and she said the same to me. I'd see her that nightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
