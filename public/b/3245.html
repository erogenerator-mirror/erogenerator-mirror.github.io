Her breasts jutted upwards, pointing out in front of me. I realized they must be at least a C cup, but the way the rest of it was bouncing as she walked, the contrast between them, the way they shook as she stepped, and my god! She suddenly stopped, her hands sliding away from her body and to her sides. As my eyes rose upwards and caught sight of her full breasts, I felt my cock jerk and my lips quirk involuntarily.</p> <p>"Oh my god," I said aloud as I stood there in front of her as if she was the most beautiful woman in the world.</p> <p>"Hey," she said with a laugh as if I wasn't the only one who hadn't noticed them yet, "I'm still not as young as my friends, but I've got some really nice tits, too."</p> <p>The two of us seemed to have this conversation as much as we did. As we sat there, my mind filled with images of my sister's firm body all over me, and we both had the same thing in common as we both stared down at the other, only now as I looked back up at her, we both saw what she saw, because it made us both chuckle. We both sat up and crossed our fingers so, that we could play a game to see who would get the upper hand.</p> <p>"Okay," she said after a pause, "You win, I won."</p> <p>Without even looking, I could see that she already had the upper hand. I felt my eyes grow wet and felt as if I had turned crimson, my voice cracked and my cheeks were blushing almost as badly as my skin. I wondered if they would ever get over my embarrassment at showing such a weakness in front of her.</p> <p>Suddenly, our arms were wrapped around each other and we were kissing long and hard. I was surprised that my tongue wasn't in that far. She seemed to sense my hesitation, but I swear she didn't try to break away now, instead she just stood there looking us in the eye and smiling a mischievous grin, as if to say, I know we will keep this secret.</p> <p>My sister's arm slipped behind me and she pushed me back against the wall. I felt her hand slide up my skirt and over my buttocks. Then she moved back so that she could unfasten the snap on my jeans and slid them down my legs. I realized that our hands were joined, but mine were still held in front as if it were a battle of which button you had to press. My panties were still in front; she had apparently decided, by her touch that it would be the next stage of her game.</p> <p>"There," she said as if she were reading my mind, "You'll get to see my surprise soon enough."</p> <p>With that, she pushed me back against the wall, pulled her t-shirt off, and threw it across the room. She stood there for a second; her naked body was the perfect size I'd been dreaming of for so long. Her breasts were still large, but she had retained her fullness and seemed to have grown as well. Her flat stomach was toned as well and I felt the soft touch of her skin as our hands met. She smiled at me again as she slid her hand around my waist and hooked her fingers into the waistband of my skirt. Slowly she slid her hand along my panties, feeling the texture and warmth of my skin, her fingers gently stroking my most intimate place.</p> <p>As the skirt and panties floated away I felt the fabric of her panties brush my leg while we kissed. My heart beat faster in my chest as I felt her fingers slip under the fabric, pressing harder against me. Suddenly, she moved away from me and stepped back against the wall, facing me. I couldn't help but take a step back. My eyes stayed fixed on her as she looked downward at me through half-closed eyes, so intent and focused on what she was doing with her fingertips still on me. She was deliberately looking down at me and, I realized suddenly, I had the full effect of looking like some sort of sex slave. Her eyes were intense as she stared at my exposed breasts, my waist, my legs and my pussy.</p> <p>She stepped closer, still not breaking eye contact. Then she slid her soft fingers along my thighs from my thigh and around my knee to my calf, stopping just as my knee came into contact with hers. Her eyes met mine and I felt like I'd never had the courage to look into them. As I was still standing there, completely unable to hide my nakedness, I felt my hands run up to her shoulders. I tried to reach toward her in hopes that she would let me. She did, but seemed to be taking no action this time.
