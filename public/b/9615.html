He opened the envelope and began to read a note. "Call me," he said, and hung it up.</p> <p>He was at a small café by the airport when he saw the note on the table. It said, "Call." He stared at the clock on the glass door. Forty-five minutes. "Damn, I'm tired. My plane is already at the airport. I should get going now."</p> <p>"Not too late," was all he said. The taxi took them to the airport and they took off for the terminal and checked in. He went to the gate while she watched the other people waiting. The flight attendants got him the flight ticket to the terminal and he smiled as he looked over the manila envelop. The envelope contained his wife's name and phone number. "My God." He sat at the counter and watched some people walking out the terminal. The driver came by and tipped her. He made sure it was good for him to have it. After parking he headed toward an area on the first floor where he was directed to a small jewelry counter. "I am sorry; I am no expert as on most things. I never would, but I am glad you are not married. I have a ring on my finger. Do you have a cell phone?"</p> <p>"No I don't," she said. He watched her turn the dial but she didn't pick up. "I can call later." He stared straight ahead as he listened to her cell phone. He had been right. It had a picture of her and him that he snapped. He knew her name. Maybe he could have her number. "What in the hell were you thinking?" He was still trying to process what was happening, until he heard her voice. Her voice changed slightly from that of a young woman in a long coat who had just came from the store. "What the hell are you doing?" The voice said.</p> <p>"Heidi."</p> <p>"Who the hell are you?" she said without missing a beat. Her voice had an edge to it. "What's with you? What's happening?" she was asking now. He found himself wondering how on earth he was supposed to react to this voice. He turned and walked toward her. "I have a beautiful wife." He said.</p> <p>"I don't know what you're talking about," she exclaimed. He stopped to kiss her, but she turned and started toward the baggage claim. "I can't believe that I don't know anything about you," she said. He turned and saw her standing over him; looking up at him with a smile.</p> <p>"I'm not telling you that, Heidi."</p> <p>"But you are," her voice was softer now. "You and me are together. What makes you think that we are married?"</p> <p>She reached up with both hands and pulled him down on top of her. "I'm just happy for you. Do you remember, you are my one and only? What does it even matter what the reason is you couldn't have me? I will tell you all of this if you don't."</p> <p>Heidi's voice was a little higher now. "Oh, God, this is so hot!" With her arms around him he kissed her on the lips. She responded with a moan. They broke apart and kissed again and again, for several minutes.</p> <p>Her hand found his crotch. He felt a bulge; he wanted to pull the woman away from her so as to be able to control whatever would happen next. He did that. "I love you," he said.</p> <p>"I love you so much," she said. She reached down, and took his hand that was already moving up under her skirt. She took off her jacket and handed it to him. He took her jacket off her shoulders and slid it down. Her hands found his cock and she stroked it through his pants. It was hard as iron, and her hand was moving it in slow circles on his meat.</p> <p>"Let's go up here," she said and ran her hands over his ass. One of her hands was under her skirt, and her finger slid up his ass crack and found it. It had never felt anything as wet and warm as that before. He had never felt such a combination of the heat of a woman at different times, and the wetness of a pussy. He could imagine himself standing here fucking this woman.</p> <p>The elevator came to an abrupt stop at the first stop light and John had to keep driving because they were going over some sort of state speed limit. He was getting dizzy. He glanced over a little bit to the right and saw that the front door had slammed closed. The back window had been open for several minutes. She was naked and—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
