I couldn't say the words I had wanted to hear from her in several days, or even more. We looked each other in the eye and we looked at each other for a few seconds. Her full lips parted with a tiny sound, her soft, moist mouth opening and closing once more as if she were taking a deep breath, taking my whole body in. Her full breasts rose majestically as she moved, her nipples already hard, her heart beating fast.</p> <p>"Come on, love", she whispered, her hand reaching out to my face. "Do you trust me?"</p> <p>"Yes", I said</p> <p>Her hand touched my cheek tenderly, my lips opening to hers and her tongue gently touched mine.</p> <p>"I want you, love."</p> <p>"Me too."</p> <p>We stood there, not knowing what to make of the situation that was developing. I couldn't find the words, I just knew that I had to do it, we were both new to this, this had been the life's work. I felt her hand on my shoulder, she moved it slowly downwards and I turned around. Our bare breasts brushed on each other as we kissed and her hands touched my breasts as if her heart belonged in them. I was about to say something, but we must have stopped because she moved her hand to caress my cheek, she whispered in my ear, "I know you'd do anything for me and I want you."</p> <p>She led me to her own bedroom, and we moved together in the darkness of the bedroom, kissing and touching all the while. I felt her hand on my ass as she moved me around to the large king size bed. We stood in silence watching each other undress. I moved down to the foot of the bed, and she slowly pushed me backwards until my back rested against the headboard, and I lay face down. I felt her kneel around me and she took my hands, lifting them, placing them above my head, her hands behind my head, her tits pressing against my bare ass. I felt my arms pulled up and I felt my feet being tied with thick material to the bed frame. I didn't resist as she moved in front of my face, and I felt her lips on first my right, then my left, kissing me deeply once before rising to straddle my head. She held the lips of my pussy down against my face, I felt her tongue run across them as I felt her nipples pushing against mine. She stopped kissing me, and moved her head up to kiss the left nipple, as I felt her tongue begin to flick my other nipple, it was incredibly erotic, like a fire has been ignited in my pussy and I moaned in response. I felt my pussy lips open and she began to lick my pussy from between my thighs, leaving just the tip of her tongue inside me and rubbing it directly against my clit on each stroke. It felt so good, my body was trembling as I felt myself nearing the point of no return.</p> <p>Her tongue touched my clit again and she looked up at me, still holding my hands to get me to release a little. I felt she was in control now and she moved forward and began to lick my pussy again in one smooth motion. I felt my juices starting to flow as I responded to her and I felt her fingers spread me wider. They moved into me then, and I felt that it was my turn. I began to moan uncontrollably as I felt the first orgasm come through me, I closed my eyes and threw my head back.</p> <p>"FUCKKKKKKkkk"</p> <p>"Mmmmfffffff"</p> <p>"Oooooh"</p> <p>I opened my eyes to see her eyes watching me as her tongue explored, moving back and forth from my clit. I was in total ecstasy and it felt so good, as if she was aching for me. I was losing myself as she continued to lick me, she could do anything she wanted with me.</p> <p>"Mmmmfffffffffffff"</p> <p>"Ugh"</p> <p>"Uuuuunnnngggghhh"</p> <p>"Fuck"</p> <p>She lifted her head, and I opened to see her face between my legs, her tongue moving deep inside my pussy, and she looked so beautiful as I watched her do it, moving that tongue very far inside my pussy. I was losing control again, my hips moving forward towards her face, pushing my pussy against her as she continued to lick. I felt my whole body shaking, my hands holding tightly onto the bed frame as my orgasm built.</p> <p>"FUCKKKKKKK"</p> <p>"FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
