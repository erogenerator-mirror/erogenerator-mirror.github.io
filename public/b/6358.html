I'm sorry, Baby. I forgot about your father." She was very sweet when she smiled. I didn't respond. Her voice came through a soft smile, "I want a brother too, Will. But only if you agree completely!" We were quiet for a few seconds. "Now why don't we go through the rest of your clothes for the night. You will be happy to see your Dad again. It is a very comfortable position if you feel comfortable and you look good without clothes."</p> <p>I was nervous and excited. "Are you sure we can do this? I don't know what I'd do if anyone saw we did this. I don't know if I'd like it."</p> <p>"You don't have to agree. It just gets better." I took care with some of my underwear and she found a cute little negligee for me, a short black skirt and a tank top. I put them on and walked into the bedroom to change.</p> <p>Her arms circled me as we looked at each other and I felt a shiver go down my spine. "My God! Will! You can't do this, I don't know what I'd have done to you if I had known we'd fuck so soon. I don't know if I'd ever stop loving you." She kissed my cheek and I turned into her arms and we began kissing like lovers. I had been thinking about this moment while watching her every day since last night. I just wanted to say it.</p> <p>We kissed and kissed and kissed and kissed until a knock at the door woke us from a long kiss. We went to the door to see our fathers, Will and Jason. Jason was wearing a suit and looked like he didn't even live.</p> <p>"Dad, I don't know...we've just been waiting so long!" I told him what I had to say. "I haven't heard you yet! What made you wear something sexy?" Will asked with mock surprise.</p> <p>When our fathers got to speak, they looked at me and saw me wearing lingerie; it was the same lingerie Will had given me last night and it made me feel all sexy and erotic. "Will, Dad, I feel like such a school girl...my dad just gets so excited that he just goes to the closet and finds something to wear! I've never come that fast in a week!" We laughed and Jason said, "You look like a sexy little school girl!" We laughed.</p> <p>"Oh, Dad, my boobs! My Dad loves 'em!" They both looked at me, wondering what I was wearing. I looked at them, showing them to both of them. "Oh my God! I don't wear this anymore!" I said as they looked at me and then at my hair; it was a mess. They watched me with interest, not knowing that I was looking at their father, my new lover, and a stranger, and I felt really sexy and sexy as I knew he did.</p> <p>We went on to bed together and I thought to myself, I've been on my feet in two days! A good long talk with a hot young man and all three of them were wondering if I really was still wearing something. I don't know if we will ever be able to go out on a date again but I think I just hope they'll all agree once I go to sleep with my Dad in the future and we know exactly what he wants, too. It's so exciting being the sexy teen-ager you've always wanted.</p> <p>Chapter 6</p> <p>It was Saturday morning when they left, the first day of November. Will had been gone a couple of weekends and Jason and I weren't exactly sure when my Dad and I were going to be alone or whether it would be at some fancy restaurant. We decided that it couldn't last all night. That's when they told me to go into a ladies room with mom and have the room ready when we returned. Will and Jason were going out for breakfast the next morning. Will left an overnight bag with us and Jason and I went back to the apartment before leaving for the restaurant. When we met in the restaurant I was really excited and happy, but I knew it was going to get awkward if either one of them saw us.</p> <p>My father was sitting at a table in the center of the room, smiling and smiling at Will. Jason was talking at me and Will was talking to him and Will had stopped talking to tell him I loved him. After a few words we sat down, but not close enough for Will, who asked me how much money I had left, if anything. I told him I have no money, that I have gone to college and that I'd have to go back to college without it because I had to attend school there. He told me to relax, that it was not necessary to go with him to theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
