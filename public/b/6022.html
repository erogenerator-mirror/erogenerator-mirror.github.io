I wasn’t too worried, and even though Tommy was a friend, I knew that he’d probably be able to do all that I had to do with him, given enough time. Tom was a good looking enough guy, but his reputation as a nerd was something that I could easily crack and get off on. It did make him a little bit more fun to play with – even more fun than with Tom, in fact. The problem was that I knew that a lot more was going to happen in a few short days, and that I didn’t want that to be so that Tom was completely cut off from what ever was going on at home in Chicago. I didn’t ask what kind of movie Tom had on, but I knew that if it was not made and a little late I’d have to tell him or Tommy it was the last of the good things he’d see over the coming couple of days. So I went home and had an interesting talk with Tommy on Sunday. When he answered my text, I gave him a quick summary.</p> <p>Tom: Hey it’s time now!”</p> <p>Me: Ok.</p> <p>Tom: Yeah, I’m just about to get out of the shower! And, I’m going to be late. It’ll just be a quickie.”</p> <p>Tom: That’s what I was thinking. We’ll still have another hour. Don’t worry, I’ll be home in 5 or so!”</p> <p>As I looked at his reply, I realized that it was a very strange experience to be feeling this way. Tom was not saying much anymore.</p> <p>Tom: Can you pick some up?</p> <p>Me: Sure. And I’ll order it for you too.</p> <p>Tom: What?</p> <p>Me: A movie.”</p> <p>TOM: Ok, see you soon.</p> <p>Tom: Thanks!</p> <p>I went back into the bathroom.</p> <p>I walked out to the living room, with the video on the camera in the front. I couldn’t really explain what really looked in the video, really, that much of what I saw was one thing, and what really looked like was another. I found that it was rather interesting and very erotic to hear that sort of stuff, especially on some of the more interesting ones. That did help me with the question of why I was even looking at that kind of stuff and not just looking at the images myself while playing a video. I turned the video to something called “Hotwife”. It had the same title in it as “Porn Star”, and there was also a video of me with several girls on camera. I found that that kind of thing really turned me on, and I felt more excited at the thought of being in close proximity to one of these girls. It did make me wonder if maybe we were getting into the “real thing”.</p> <p>Then I watched a video, of my mom in the basement, in the nude. For a small time at least, I wondered whether or not I’d actually been to her, but I was beginning to wonder that if I had, the first night, at least, been in her bedroom. And now I was sitting around the living room, watching a video, of that sort, that was actually pretty exciting. A young, somewhat skinny girl, standing in the front hallway, looking at herself in the mirror. I decided to look away for a brief moment. But then I had to look again, before I left the living room. There was something else that I was really interested in in the video as well, and since I couldn’t see what it was, I decided to be kind of vague on what it was for.</p> <p>It showed just a couple of different guys in various states of dress clothes getting ready to take part in an orgy. And then the two girls got naked. Mom got really loud. “Come on. Let’s go home! We have to leave soon!” said a voice.</p> <p>I really didn’t want to look at them, and I think that was really something. But then I realized that I was having trouble watching the video. That might be partly because it was rather tastefully sexual, and I felt embarrassed for acting this way with the guys in it. It was too much to take in. It really didn’t help having a really bad erection in the process. I could still feel the wetness between my legs in the bedroom.</p> <p>I watched some more. I guess it showed a girl getting a strap-on dildo out of a drawer and putting it on. I didn’t see any of it—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
