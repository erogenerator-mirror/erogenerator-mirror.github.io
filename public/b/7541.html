My mouth formed a perfect "O" as I stared at his cock. The head was almost purple, and he had gone slightly down its length. The shaft glistened with pre-cum, glistening in the light. The veins stood out, the crown beginning to show itself, a deep crimson and a light blue. The hair was thick and wavy, long and flowing, cascading down over his balls, and they were large and black. My mouth watered at the thought of sucking them, and I knew I had done this a thousand times, and had learned so much.</p> <p>He nodded as I lay on my back, my hand reaching to cover my face. He ran one finger between my lips, collecting my moisture, and slipped it into my mouth for me to taste. I sucked his finger in, my lips wrapping around it as I felt it slip into my ass. He pushed it in and out a bit, using it like a lubricant.</p> <p>He took each hand and wrapped them over my head, keeping me there and pushing his cock against my opening. I felt it spread open, but it seemed to stretch to accommodate him. He was almost completely in me now, and I wanted that deep.</p> <p>Pulling back slightly, he pushed the shaft further into me. It touched my throat again, like it was going in there before. I held it there, feeling his heat enter my throat. I moaned in pleasure as he slid his cockhead in and out, each time feeling the tightness of my throat. His hand stroked over my face, feeling me suck him. I could see the head of his cock swell, and he stopped, as if he was trying to draw it out.</p> <p>He moved me back some, and I felt his hand pulling my lips apart. I felt a tongue on my clitoris, and he was licking it. My body arched up against his. He lowered me back on to the bed, his lips and tongue still moving over me. He moved my panties aside and felt his finger inside me. I shivered at the coolness. He pushed further down, deeper, and felt me quiver. He continued to stroke me, making me moan louder.</p> <p>He took his finger out of my pussy, and I felt it sliding up and down my crack, touching my anus. My cheeks parted, and a cool fluid was running down over my hole, and across. He rubbed it into my tight hole, and then pushed his finger further inside.</p> <p>He pushed on my anus a bit, making me moan louder, as his finger slid into my ass. His thumb rubbed over my clit, making me quiver. I could feel him pushing a finger as deep as it was going to go, as he continued working his fingers in and out of my butt. He worked his finger as deep as it would go, and I moaned again.</p> <p>He slid it out of me and moved down my body, his lips and tongue kissing me all the way. I felt my body quiver again, and my hand moved into his hair. I couldn't have stopped him if I had wanted to. My arms were outstretched around his neck as he buried his face in my neck.</p> <p>We lay there for several minutes, until I could feel him move. I didn't want to move. I had never felt anything more beautiful before. As he moved down by my face, he lowered himself to cover me again. He kissed me, his tongue probing in and out of my mouth. I could taste my cum on his lips, and I moaned into his mouth.</p> <p>I felt his finger again, and suddenly I was empty except for his finger inside me. My hands moved to his buttocks, and I pulled him closer, to me. "Make love to me," I whispered. He raised himself up onto his side and slipped his cock into my wet opening.</p> <p>I moved with him, feeling another tongue on my clitoris as he began to move his pelvis, sliding in and out. I began to rub my fingers over his chest, pulling on his nipples, feeling him move inside me.</p> <p>A finger ran down from my anus to my clitoris, stroking across it, before returning to my anus. I moaned again as his finger pushed into me. It slid back, and I shuddered as he pushed it forward. He pressed harder, his finger going further into me. I moaned loudly, and he moaned too.</p> <p>He pulled his fingers from my pussy, pushed his cock into my pussy. With a slight tug, his hand withdrew, leaving his penis in me. He began stroking in and out, making a noise, as he moved. He moved faster, moving me, moving me towards the end of my climax and wanting to feel the final moments that would comeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
