That would absolutely suck!"</p> <p>It was the best part of the story he'd ever imagined! The first time, his hands held her in place, her legs around his waist. He pressed her back against the wall and slid the tip of his erection against her warm wet core, gently rubbing its tip up the length of her channel and back down to the bottom. His hands held her shoulders, pressing her breasts into the cold brick wall between the walls. He held her hips. He slowly eased his penis into her. Her muscles clenched. Her eyes squeezed shut. Her head lolled from side to side on the wooden wall behind her. He lowered his face to hers. His lips met hers. The taste of her sweet lip gloss on his tongue drove him to new heights, and he slid deep into her in one smooth movement.</p> <p>"Uunnnhhh!"</p> <p>The sound echoed across the empty street in their ears. And then they were kissing, passionately and passionately. The whole world went black.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>The door opened, and in walked a dark face wearing a black silk robe held in place by a silver clasp.</p> <p>"Hi, Mrs. Brown."</p> <p>And she'd come looking for him already, smiling at him with a broad, deep brown grin. "Hi, sweetheart. What's up?"</p> <p>"I just wanted to say how much, uh... appreciative... you are on the wall, uh, I mean... I just... it's so... big," he stammered, unable to put it all together.</p> <p>"It's what you need, sweetheart. Come in. It's so nice to see you again."</p> <p>And he did.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I'm really busy this afternoon, I'm having a conference with some associates from my engineering class later in the week..."</p> <p>That would make her happy! He didn't even say the word 'attending', they just entered the house as he'd promised. He saw her coming, but his heart was still in her hand. "Hello..."</p> <p>"How long?"</p> <p>"I'll leave you to it." And he opened another door, and another one. He stepped into a room, and there was her sitting on a wooden stool in front of a desk, arms crossed on the other side. The woman's face was stern, and her eyes seemed to be hidden behind a hood. The voice was dark, but not unpleasant. "You will speak only when spoken to. Don't you see? Now, tell me why you came to see me?"</p> <p>"I... I have something planned that we will make sure of when I get back," he said, as if a question was being asked, but not answered, or answered. She'd left the chair she was sitting on, and was standing just under the desk. Her voice was low and even, and yet the timbre of her voice made it almost hypnotic. "It's about a business deal..."</p> <p>"You're talking about... about what?"</p> <p>"When you're finished with your first call, I think I'll have a heart to finish the second. It's about an arrangement I'm having. My associate, Jonathan, wants to be with us. He's very demanding. We get what we want... well... I've wanted to know if that would be too much to ask of you." And she paused, for a moment, like she was waiting for something. "Oh, don't worry. This is not going to be easy. I know he's your friend. I can tell he likes you because you look so much like he does when you show up in a pretty dress."</p> <p>"Oh... I look good... I guess." Her eyes were bright, bright green. Their eyes twinkling from side to side.</p> <p>"Is there anything special you want?"</p> <p>"I wanted to talk business. How is this going to be a deal?"</p> <p>"Of course it is," and her voice went cold, almost as if the door was opened by an ice. "You can have all your clothes back, and you can stay here. No touching. You heard me."</p> <p>He felt himself get lost in the deep blue gaze of her green eyes. He wanted to run. But he couldn't. He just stood there, looking down on this stranger. He didn't know what to do. There wasn't any point in being shy anymore. It would be bad enough, wouldn't it? He just dropped in the chair she was sitting on and tried to gather his thoughts. He didn't know what to make of the woman who stood up and just stared at him. And how did she know what he was thinking and doing? It was a question he couldn't even think of. What if some one else had heard himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
