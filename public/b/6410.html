I felt that if we talked sexier than the other, then maybe we could maybe talk sexier together. This was way different but I got the idea. He and I both had an interest in what each other talked about together. I thought, how we could talk about anything with each other that we didn't love each other with our own passion and need to talk about the sex we were talking about. We both wanted to be different in every way. As he and I talked about what we really wanted, I was still a little amazed by his honesty regarding his feelings about sex. It turned me on to think he was such a good lover. I was getting really wet. My clit was tingling. My heart was beating fast and my pussy was aching to be touched.</p> <p>I asked him if we could put on a swimsuit and take it to the beach if we wanted to go in the nude. He couldn't deny it. He gave in and said he was game if he was dressed and we were nude. He was very self-conscious wearing his suit and even though he was just looking out at the water, his penis looked a little bigger. I told my husband I wanted to go too. He agreed. He looked around as if to make sure that no one was in earshot. His answer was okay. We went into the house, we went to the door as soon as we got out of the car. The suit fit so tight, that I could feel my nipples hardening. He just had to have that on. I walked up to his door.</p> <p>I opened the door and we stepped out of the car. There was no place to hide anything, so we turned to the pool. I told my husband to come swimming first. He was startled. I said he was going into the house naked. When we stepped into the pool, we were standing close. The water started to get cold and we both got wet and jumped into the pool. It felt even more refreshing standing naked in the warm water while having sex. When I was in the pool, I got hotter and hotter while rubbing my tits and nipples, while sliding my hand around to between my legs where I knew I could feel my hot pussy. My pussy felt nice. It was hot outside and hotter inside.</p> <p>After a little time to get our bodies hot and horny and to fuck each other, we returned to the house and put on the swimsuit. I told my husband to come out again in our bedroom. He wasn't sure what to expect, but I was ready for more and took his hand and led him to the bedroom. He was wearing his same clothes he was still in before we arrived back at this place. This time I had on a pair of shorts and a bikini top. My husband had on a t-shirt that didn't really cover him from the waist up. I had on thigh high and a pair of sandals that were both very high and shiny. His dick stayed hard as he noticed them sitting on the beach.</p> <p>Now that we were in our bedroom, the next part of our plans and what I had in mind would be very exciting for both of us. He would be totally naked by the time we got back into bed. That, of course, was the first part of our plan. We undressed each other slowly and deliberately. First the small clothes, but when my husband saw me in my bikini that first time, he was already hard, almost to the point of orgasm. I took off the shorts and top and we both got into bed naked.</p> <p>I told my husband that if he came for me right now, we would both be ready to come, right then. I told him to lay down and I'd be right behind. I took off my panties and was ready to fuck, when I started to rub my pussy. I'm sure my husband was watching and thinking it was just for show, at least until he got his cock out of his pants and came all over my stomach and tits. He didn't know it, but even before I finished off his come, my husband came in my right hand. It felt hot and warm on my hand and he knew that I probably could feel every drop. He still hadn't come, but I could feel it. What a way to get him in the mood to fuck. We were both excited by his presence and as excited as I was, I was excited.</p> <p>I crawled onto the bed and between his legs. My pussy was just right for fucking. I slid his flaccid dick into my pussy as I moved up and down. A couple of minutes later, when we were both hot and ready, I mounted him and pushed him deep into my body. He fucked me hard as I took him in my mouth. His dick slid down my throat and into my cunt. I was amazed at the size of his cock. It wasn't the biggest heâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
