Now, let's see what I can't do to keep you from getting fired. Maybe I'll buy your company, too! Okay, come sit on the couch and eat this," I instructed.</p> <p>"Sure thing, sweetheart," she said and took the coffee from my hand. I sat down next to her and she started her breakfast and we ate. I was sitting next to the two of them, and I thought about what she had said about me and this job. Maybe I could do that. Maybe, for the next year, too. Maybe, in fact, that was indeed what she was implying. My mind was churning at thought. What would I say if I were fired? This woman was really serious, wasn't she?</p> <p>She told me once that I was to be her "assguard." I didn't know it, of course, but she was really serious. I don't really know what happened, but what I did know was that even though I was to be her "assguard" for the next year, and even though she was going to make me do it, I was going to be the one to call the shots in this case. Was this going to be her fantasy? I had no idea. I didn't really have a clue. What could I do?</p> <p>She gave her permission, and I was to tell her what I was going to do. My only request was that she come to work with me, as she did. That seemed to be in the background. Now, did I care any more if my wife did that?</p> <p>She was to pick me up at 10:30 or so, and take me to a place where she would meet an office. That's it. That's what I wanted. I didn't know what she did for a living, but something about it made me want to have some sort of "honey" for her.</p> <p>I walked out of the meeting at 2:30 and went home. I did nothing. I went to my bedroom, undressed, and lay on my bed. The woman had stopped me in the act of masturbating myself the previous night. A few minutes after I came, I heard her enter my bedroom, and she was naked. She did not look at me, rather she strode into my room, sat on my bed, lay with just her knees and feet on the bed beside my head and laid her head against my shoulder, her face against my breast. I thought it was time to see what my wife's mouth would do.</p> <p>I went to her. I kissed her, then caressed her breasts and tummy, and down her belly. I kissed her lips, which were still open in anticipation of our next meeting. When she said her approval, I began to kiss her pussy. At some point, I had a briefcase open. As I opened it, I noted some sort of black rubber strap-on dildo. I removed it from the case and went to the next door room, to the closet. I unzipped the dildo and brought it to the level of her vagina. It fit perfectly, and I felt it touch inside her. I gently inserted it into myself.</p> <p>The only sound in the room for that little while, was the sound of my own breathing. I was already erect. It was as if there was an invisible connection between us, just like a wave that swept me from one level of the ocean into another. She sat on top of me, her face inches from my own, kissing me again and gently pushing her hips down. Then she began to ride me.</p> <p>She said nothing, but said everything. She began to moan and I felt like she was going crazy, so I put my arms around her and stroked her breasts. In some strange way, she said "Yes. Oh, Jesus, yes." At the point of climax, she began to cum, and she said "I could have used an orgasm like that, but I had to work this out first." She moved down and licked me once. That was enough stimulation for both of us. She rolled off me, to get a condom on, and climbed off the bed.</p> <p>I lay there, still half-hard, feeling it, which she apparently felt it. She went to the bed, and opened my blindfold. She said "It's not what you think" and kissed me deeply. We remained there for some time, exploring each other's body all over, from head to toe. Finally, she climbed back on the bed. She kissed me softly on the lips, and I told her to take off the blindfold. I kissed her again, and said "Just relax. I'll do all the work. I just know where I want you to go next."</p> <p>She began kissing and teasingly licking my nipples. She said that she wanted me to take my shirt off so sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
