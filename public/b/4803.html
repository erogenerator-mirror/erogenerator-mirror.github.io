You still up?" I asked, turning around to get a blanket, and he followed me with it as we both quickly shed all of our clothes in the back cabin, the warm air washing over us.</p> <p>His cock was hard as a rock already; a long-nailed finger playing softly over my stomach and over my mound as he lay down on the blanket. Looking across the back cabin, I saw his feet touching my thighs, making me moan softly.</p> <p>"Is this where you were all the last time you played with your pussy?" He asked, leaning over me. I smiled, spreading my legs apart for him as he leaned in to kiss my neck. I smiled, knowing it would feel good. He smiled back, his tongue lapping lightly over my neck as he slowly moved back to suck and tease each of my hardened nipples, leaving them exposed as he did so.</p> <p>I moaned once more, wanting him to touch me so badly that I could stand it for hours.</p> <p>Taking my right breast in his hand, he slowly began to stroke his finger down my stomach, brushing lightly over my lips as he did so. I moaned, already wetting my lips with my desire.</p> <p>"Tell me what you want me to do." He whispered, leaning back as he watched my lips flutter over my nipples as I looked up at him, reaching for him.</p> <p>I knew it wouldn't take much pleading or begging. I had already made me the very one I had always wished I had, but never the other way around. He was not going to be that way, I was going to be what I had always wished I had - just not quite this man, right now. If I could keep my emotions bottled up, this last time would be it.</p> <p>"Suck me!" I moaned, pulling away from him. He smiled, nodding and pulling me up, pushing on my shoulders until I was sitting against the headboard, spreading my legs as wide as he could.</p> <p>"Tell me what to do!" he commanded, the tone in his voice a little more than gentle. I nodded, the feeling of power flowing throughout his body as his finger slowly began to trace down my thigh, a shuddering groan escaping my lips.</p> <p>"Do it!" I said, pulling him into me as I wrapped my hands around his back, pulling him down on top of me, kissing him hard. He smiled at me as he slid his tongue into my mouth, biting down on it as he did so.</p> <p>"Say it!" I asked him.</p> <p>"Do it! I want to do it!" He replied, looking back at me. I smiled, pulling him back up to me with one hand. He slid down to taste the side of my lips, leaving a trail of kisses down my chin as he leaned in and made his way to my neck a few inches along the line. I moaned, feeling the heat of his hot breath as he began to lick and suck at my throat, slowly moving down to tease my breast. I wanted to grab him and run him down onto the floor as soon as he did.</p> <p>"Say it!" I whispered to him, his lips grazing over my hardened nipple as he moved his hand down my stomach, his fingers trailing over the swollen lips of my pussy. I bit my lip, moaning softly as he gently began to kiss my lips, slowly moving down my body.</p> <p>"Fuck me!" I whispered to him, watching him with hooded eyes as he continued to tease my lips with his tongue. My eyes narrowed, and he grinned at me, sliding his hand down to guide himself to the opening to my sex. I closed my eyes tight as he began to gently slide just the head of his cock inside me, my back arching as he pushed me back into the corner of the bed so that I was leaning against it.</p> <p>"Suck me!" I said softly, looking at him as I reached for him in turn. I pulled him down to me as I looked him in the eye, and softly guided him to me. I looked back as he entered me, the pain quickly returning to me as he pushed inside me. His pace quickened, and I moaned again as he pulled out of me again, a low moan to his.</p> <p>"Now!" I moaned again, pushing him back into me as he continued to slide inside me. He grinned at me as he pulled out of me, the look in his eyes as he slowly slid inside me making me melt in his arms again. He pushed inside me and began to thrust against me, pushing himself all the way inside me as he moaned into my neck as he continued toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
