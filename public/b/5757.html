He was naked except for a small tube of lubricant that I was to take from his bathroom drawer. He said, "Go ahead and take my cock!" Then he turned and led me to his bedroom. "Now fuck me!" he commanded.</p> <p>I felt like I was going to collapse and he put his hand over both my shoulders, holding me in place, and then shoved his cock all the way in. His cock filled me. It felt bigger than ever. It was thicker than Mike's and he started thrusting back at me. My mouth just hung open and I tried to breathe. Then I could feel it start to throb. It was huge and he began moving faster.</p> <p>He moved forward against my back, his ass now on my pelvis. Soon he was thrusting back at me with each stroke, and his body slapped against me while he fucked me. I moved my hands downward and rested them on his cock. Each stroke was just as good as the last. I could feel his balls hitting my ass, then slapping against my pussy, then up against my tits. My hands were still stroking his massive cock and my tits jiggled as we fucked.</p> <p>Suddenly I felt his legs tighten and his ass contract against me, then a second orgasm ripped through him. He pushed back at me hard and pulled my face into his ass cheek for his sperm. He pulled me forward enough to suck his cock out of my mouth, then I felt it shoot it's hot load out onto my back. My head hung up again, but I kept my mouth pressed tight against his butt. My mouth was empty, but I opened it again and tasted his juices on my tongue. He slowly pulled his cock out of my mouth. It started to fall off my body a little and hit his stomach. He turned and dropped into bed next to me and pulled me up onto his chest.</p> <p>We lay there, holding each other in the after glow of our orgasms. Then Mike turned to face me and gave me a quick kiss and then he went off to have his shower. I sat up on the side of the bed and just sat there and stared at him.</p> <p>"It was fantastic!" I exclaimed. "I can't believe the sex!"</p> <p>"Yeah, but what if Mike found out? What if you weren't on your best behavior?"</p> <p>"I don't know; maybe just maybe; I don't know! But I don't want to think that I was cheating on Mike."</p> <p>"Maybe it was the sex, but can't go that far or maybe, he didn't want to cheat on me."</p> <p>"I don't think it was cheating, it was exciting!"</p> <p>"But you didn't really cheat!"</p> <p>"No. Now that I know I'm not as good as you or Mike, maybe Mike doesn't really care"</p> <p>Then Mike came in and pulled me up on top of him. He put his arms wrapped around me and lifted my ass off of the bed. It felt so good it made me giddy at the same time. Then he took his hands and wrapped them around my body and pulled me down against him. He kissed me and squeezed my butt. When he stepped toward me, but instead of walking up to me, he took me in his arms and we kissed. His lips and tongue and hands were magic and his body was so soft and so warm.</p> <p>I turned and kissed him on his mouth then slid down toward the bed beside him, where I found his mouth. He leaned his head back on the pillow and opened his mouth wider. I slid my tongue along his lip while he moved it all around mine. We kissed gently at first, then longer, with our tongues touching and tasting. Then his tongue slipped back in and we kissed passionately. Our bodies were so much better than Mike's! We kissed each other a lot and I felt his hands wander down my body and rub and caress my tits. Mike must have liked that because he moved one hand up and slipped it under my shorts and around into my bikini bottoms. His fingers began rubbing my clit directly and started sliding his finger tips in and out of the top of my pussy.</p> <p>I opened my eyes again as Mike's mouth left mine and went down to suck on my already hard nipple. In a matter of seconds, his tongue was between the tops of my tits and my hard nipple. I reached back to his head and grabbed his hair and pulled his face deeper into my tits then he did it again.</p> <p>"Make me cum!" I told him and he did. "I'm going to fuck you! I'm going to fuck your brains out!"</p> <p>My body had never been so excited with Mike. I knew it was wrong, I knew it would be wrong, but I couldn't stop it. Mike's cock was still hard. And I knew I really wantedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
