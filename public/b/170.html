"It's a pleasure meeting you, Sir Colin. I'm sure we'll have a very memorable night together," she winked at me, and we both laughed at the thought of that.</p> <p>"You should see the little girl," she whispered to me before kissing me on the cheek again. "You're a lucky man, Colin," she finished with a wink. "And I'm looking forward to seeing you in action again at the gym next week. Perhaps the girls can join us as well for a little fun."</p> <p>"Mum," Colin stuttered, looking a bit awkward. "Mum, are you sure Colin is okay with this?"</p> <p>"Yes, he was a bit of a letdown at first, but I saw this opportunity to play this game with him before he lost his temper. He knows that you're my favourite employee, and the fun is just for us. And this new job will definitely help us out, Colin." She kissed my cheek, and Colin's body stiffened at her words. "But Colin will have to make himself scarce to keep you company until later," she said brightly. "Come on, Sir Colin, I don't want you to get caught being a little spoilt."</p> <p>Colin smiled to himself, but before he had a chance to answer, he made another turn and was greeted by my wife and her boyfriend, a tall black man about our height and weight. He was dressed in a pair of tight grey trousers which revealed an impressive bulge in those pants. He looked rather overzealous, and Colin obviously took this as a 'last chance'. My wife smiled back at him, then her boyfriend, and they headed off to the changing rooms.</p> <p>The locker rooms had a mirrored curtain on it, and Colin watched as his wife led him through a door. The cubicles were about the same height as our cubicle, and only the two cubicles were made for Colin and me. There was a locker on each side, and Colin went straight in. For some odd reason, the cubicle nearest to me, was the only place Colin could have fit his t-shirt in. He bent down to take his boots off and his cock began to harden instantly. He pulled down the hem on his t-shirt slightly, showing that his midriff was clearly visible. My wife made no attempt at hiding herself, and I found the whole situation rather erotic. Her boyfriend stepped away from the door and slipped off his jacket. His tight black jeans were tight against his skin, but not loose, and despite the tightness, his prick was showing signs of blood still.</p> <p>His gaze locked on Colin's crotch, and he slowly lowered them down to his shoes, his hand reaching out and stroking up Colin's leg, stopping to look through his crack of his bum. I was getting a real thrill as Colin's gaze came up to meet mine, and I saw the familiar look of longing on her face. Her smile seemed to be saying she wasn't all that bothered about it at the moment. She lifted her head to look at Colin's eyes as he returned her gaze, and she gave him a very shy smile. Colin seemed a little overwhelmed with the situation, so my wife broke the eye contact and sat on the lid.</p> <p>"Is everything alright Colin?" she whispered as Colin continued to watch, his hand reaching out to caress up her arm. "Oh I'm sorry."</p> <p>I leaned over her. "Are you alright, Mum?"</p> <p>"I'm not, Colin." She lifted her head up, smiling at him. "He seems a little overwhelmed."</p> <p>"He's a man Colin," my wife said to my girlfriend. "He's my man. He needs this," she murmured to her boyfriend, and Colin moved his hand to caress my wife's knee. "And he's very sexy."</p> <p>My wife smiled at Colin, and he lifted his hand up to my wife's face and gently kissed her lips. My wife reached out her leg, allowing my boyfriend to touch her thigh. Colin slid his hand up higher, feeling the smooth skin, before slipping his fingers under the edge of my wife's skirt, and running his hand around the inside of her thigh. The two guys seemed to be oblivious to the fact that my girlfriend would probably be exposed in such a manner.</p> <p>As Colin's fingers moved higher, their kisses became more passionate, causing my wife to moan softly and arch her head back. I saw Colin start to lean forward, pulling his shorts down. My wife's boyfriend did the same and both Colin and a grinning Colin stood up, their bulges now visibly growing from the excitement. My wife was gasping for breath, and could hardly take her eyes away from the spectacle of the cocksucking pair.
