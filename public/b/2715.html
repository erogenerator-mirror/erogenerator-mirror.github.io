He really didn't want to, but at the same time, he did. He pulled her over on him, but the kiss would not end.</p> <p>She giggled as she squirted out, and his hand on the outside of her thigh, and again. As it became apparent, he was not a virgin, and the touch was electric. And while he still was not sure he felt much of a boy, he did.</p> <p>"Kiss me," he whispered. When he did, it was a soft, sweet kiss. She shivered. She didn't want to stop.</p> <p>She pulled back, and stared at him. Her eyes were glazed over, and she was still breathing, but a look of surprise was still there. "Are...are you..." she stammered. She wanted to stop him at the last second, but she didn't. He held her to him and kissed her one more time.</p> <p>After they got dressed, she asked, "Do you ever...you know...?"</p> <p>"Yes," he replied. "And it never ceased to amaze me."</p> <p>As they headed to the exit, he kissed her again and said, "I'll be here, baby, I won't be anywhere near your ass."</p> <p>She shuddered. "Oh my God," she said, still shaking. "But you'll be right on my ass."</p> <p>She had stopped. "I...I have a present for you," she said, her voice shaky.</p> <p>He had smiled and opened the door. She slid him in and closed the door. "You are one amazing man," she whispered, as she was on the elevator.</p> <p>Back home, in his room, she was standing in the bathroom taking a quick shower. Her mood lightened, and he was standing in the doorway looking at her. He pulled her into him, and kissed her so tenderly she fell against him, and held on to her, and kissed the top of her head. "I love you," he whispered.</p> <p>"I love you too, Tim," she replied, and they went to his room. As she opened the door, he was still in her clothes, but he kissed her again.</p> <p>"Honey, I still want this and I can't wait any longer."</p> <p>She smiled, knowing he was right. "No. I don't want this right now. I want you, and I want you right now."</p> <p>"We can always stop." He had already picked out a dress. He looked at his watch. "I've got to get to work. I'm supposed to call."</p> <p>She held him and told him to go home. "Okay," she said.</p> <p>"I love you," he said. "And I won't stop loving you...anymore."</p> <p>"I love you too, Tim," she added, as she hugged him.</p> <p>The drive to her apartment was about twenty minutes. He held her to him, and kissed her. She pressed against him and felt her breath come right out in little gasps. He was feeling her passion and she could feel that too. He held her, and felt her soft body in his hands.</p> <p>"I love you, honey," he told her as they drove to her apartment, and again.</p> <p>She turned to kiss him, and their lips met. He could see how much she wanted him in the light of the parking lot. He pushed her against her door, and she kissed him. As they kissed, her hands undid his shirt, and slid it off so they could get as naked.</p> <p>They were almost over, he thought. If this went any further, it would have happened within minutes. He lifted her to her feet and pushed her against the wall. He could feel her legs against his body; the smell of her arousal coming from inside her. He wanted to just keep kissing her, but he knew it was his time, and as long as he didn't come soon, there would be time later. She was a gorgeous woman.</p> <p>She didn't want it to end, she thought as they made out for a long time. Maybe she should let him fuck her. But his fingers felt good where they were. She was hot, wet inside, and felt as if her panties were moist. The way he was holding her, his tongue, his lips, made her feel sexy and alive, and a little strange. She loved it, Tim, she told herself, because he wanted to love her too.</p> <p>He had her turned away from him, and put his hands on her hips, while he held her. He was about to take her. Maybe it was the way her skirt was pulled up; maybe it was her panties, and maybe it was from hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
