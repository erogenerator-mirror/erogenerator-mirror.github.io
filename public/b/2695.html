"Oh, my goodness, what did—what did—what did he do—what—I can't believe!"</p> <p>Jenny laughed again. "You'll learn, right?"</p> <p>"Right. And when he came back, he took off his coat and tie, and I was so proud of him. After we kissed for a little while, he took me into the bathroom. Then he asked if there was anything he could do for my 'boutime of enjoyment.'"</p> <p>"I was disappointed." She giggled again. I've not been as aroused since.</p> <p>"Oh, we were just playing with each other—no real intent or anything. We just...well, I got this, too."</p> <p>"I want to know everything about his cock, you know."</p> <p>"Oh, my—yes. Oh, my gawd! I am so embarrassed."</p> <p>"Yeah, well, your husband says we get off on a man's cock. That is just what happened at our last dance."</p> <p>"We were trying to fool each other, too."</p> <p>Jenny took my hand and put it on her thigh as she stood up, and said, "There are really no rules in this. Just go, and let me get a bit of that thing myself." She led me up the stairs to our room, and we had a lovely, long, hot session—just like our last night in that dark bedroom. As Jenny led me into the bathroom with us, I saw she was taking her clothes off in the steam. The rest of the way through the bathroom, though, a nice surprise was just a hair-bath. We still had two orgasms—we had a lot of them, but still more of one together than one together.</p> <p>My cock was still fully erect, but was beginning to flag at attention. We were going to take it in to the bedroom, I knew, when we opened the door again. But Jenny's husband was in a robe, and he could still see us as we stood right in front of him.</p> <p>"Take off your clothes, then, and come in here," he said, as his gaze moved back and forth from me to my eyes.</p> <p>"I've heard this sort of thing before," he said.</p> <p>"Yeah," I said sheepishly. I started to take off my clothes, but then I saw he was still looking at me. So, too, was I.</p> <p>"No. Take them off, too, you know."</p> <p>"I don't know why I do," I replied.</p> <p>"Come on. Take them off, too. I'll take care of this, too. But I want to watch. I like to watch men do it!"</p> <p>"Oh, my gawd. I really want him to see me—see my cunt. Oh, gawd! Oh, gawd! Look at my cunt!"</p> <p>I wasn't ready for that, but I kept undressing. He just stared at me. "You are so beautiful. Look at you. Do you like me watching you?"</p> <p>"Oh, gawd, you're making me wet—like nothing I've ever felt before."</p> <p>"Gawd, you're a sexy woman. I thought you were going to be in a threesome or something."</p> <p>Jenny stepped forward to me at the side of the bedroom door. "I wasn't kidding either. Look at how wet I am, and there is your wife's pussy."</p> <p>She reached out to grab my hand, and led me back toward the light. "Come on in there and make yourself comfortable. You're getting into the role here, aren't you?"</p> <p>"Yeah."</p> <p>"Come over here, then. Take off your robe."</p> <p>I followed her instructions, but I didn't know why. Then I undid the knot under my robe, and let it fall to the floor. I was not in a hurry to be out of my robe, I knew, but Jenny knew it too, and she pulled me over to one side of the bed, and sat back on the pillows near my feet.</p> <p>"Lie down here," she said. "We like to be ready for action."</p> <p>With my robe off, I was now nude, fully exposed, and Jenny got one foot on a pillow. She reached out and took hold of my cock, and started stroking it very lightly. "You don't have to be that stiff for us to get off. You have such a beautiful cock, and you have this big cock."</p> <p>"Yeah," I said. "And I'm getting into all this."</p> <p>"Yes, you're getting a stiffie, aren't you?"</p> <p>"Jenny!"</p> <p>"It's okay—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
