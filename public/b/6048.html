I thought it was cool and cool and cool and cool and cool and cool.</p> <p>John was right. He really was cool and cool and cool. He was in a job he'd been through before. I couldn't resist.</p> <p>"Yeah, OK... I guess I'll go home. I'll call you when I need me again, OK?"</p> <p>"OK, honey!" John said as he kissed my cheek and then left the rest room.</p> <p>I hung up my towel and headed for my car. I still hadn't turned my head and saw him come back out the door. He'd just finished his shower. I could hear him getting his clothes on as he left. He was getting ready to leave.</p> <p>I got in my car and drove home. As I pulled into my drive, I saw one of the women from our little office standing in the parking lot behind us. She had her arm around the other one's waist.</p> <p>"This looks like its starting to rain." I thought I could hear John say. I parked and got out of the car and walked home. As I turned the corner, John and the other woman were standing on the front steps, looking all around me.</p> <p>"Sorry about this, but it just won't do any good to take this personally," John said to me.</p> <p>"I'm gonna go do something about it myself," I said and closed the door behind me. I walked inside my house. I stripped off my uniform and put on a nightgown, wrapped myself in a towel and went upstairs. I found my robe, tossed it in the hamper, and went to my room. I sat down on the bed and put my robe on. I'd seen John naked many times before but that wasn't really all there was to know. I just figured there was something else there for me to see.</p> <p>I looked around the room and saw the bed, the dresser and dresser. There was also a couple of things to remember. There had to be something for me, something I'd need in the future. I went to the dresser and grabbed the top drawer that I always knew was there. There were pictures of me in all my glory, all of me in just the panties, bra and shoes. There were also some other stuff I didn't know had been there, but now that I saw it, it was obvious. I pulled out a small envelope.</p> <p>It was one year's anniversary present. It was a box of my new panties when I left my parents', or should that be my parents', apartment and never returned.</p> <p>My face flushed red with embarrassment. I couldn't believe I remembered it. I felt like I'd just lost my last boyfriend!</p> <p>At any rate, I figured I'd open it and see it sometime and I'd see what it said. Maybe someday.</p> <p>It was about a year ago, but only when I had been with John. The only difference was I'd had a date... not John. I felt the year without him in that little box, even though I didn't know it then, I felt like I was in his shoes.</p> <p>Maybe he'd made it his.</p> <p>I opened the box, and took out a matching set of panties and bra. They were very white. It said just three words, "for my man." I'd been told this wasn't meant to happen, but it was so close, it could come from someone else. I don't think he knew I wanted that, but I hadn't. I'd always felt ashamed of it, but I now knew the real reason why. It was from John! My heart was crushed and I couldn't stand it. I thought of all the pictures and had been torn to pieces over them. They were the ones of me, always I'd had my heart broken. The one I'd wanted, in spite of my own guilt and fear. The one I always saw myself in in his pictures! I was ashamed of him. I felt so angry!</p> <p>It was almost noon before I felt better. As I got up and left the house, I thought of how I used to see and then how I'd looked him when I was his age after I'd turned 16. I didn't regret it. I didn't regret my feelings anymore.</p> <p>I had the day off... it was my first. I wasn't worried about John, though. I didn't want to think about him. I didn't want to imagine the things John and I would do... or would do. I had no idea about what we would do... just that he was different.</p> <p>I called the office. My voice was shaky. But I was a very upsetâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
