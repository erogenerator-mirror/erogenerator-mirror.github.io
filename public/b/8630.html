It was about half a mile uphill with some narrow strips of the trail running off to the right and the left and then up a little ways into the dunes. All the way up to it, they could see the white sand under which they could see the water on the other side.</p> <p>They reached the dune without coming down from the previous trail down which left them behind, and then turned to the right about two paces when they came right with a dune in the middle and a little way to the left. They walked another mile and came to another fork.</p> <p>When they came back to the place where they had dropped off their clothing, they could see it was about 100,000 feet higher and had almost no grass at all.</p> <p>“We’ve got to pee” Jason said.</p> <p>“Well, that’s about the only place we’ve reached,” Sue said.</p> <p>When they got back up to the other side of the dunes, their legs getting wet and their feet going numb in the sand, they got their things and put on their clothes but didn’t bother to put on their shoes again.</p> <p>They walked back to Sue and headed for home. As we walked with them, Jason spoke up.</p> <p>“You and Sue are right.”</p> <p>“What do you mean you and Sue?” I asked.</p> <p>“Well, it seems like we’ve been married to long.”</p> <p>“I know you two went out on a date.”</p> <p>“I just thought you’d be with us after we had your fill. We went back to our apartment the other night and had a drink. We both got a little drunk and it was easy to get into a good mood. We’ve only had one drink before so it wasn’t as bad as you think. I think we both enjoyed it.”</p> <p>“Well, now you know it wasn’t your first but yours was.”</p> <p>“Yeah, you know, like any couple, we might add to the party by not drinking on the boat ride. You go ahead and make up the empty beer bottles. You go ahead and fill that beer up with whatever it is you’d like us to finish.”</p> <p>Dinner was the first thing that evening. They were all ready to go, as they got up they had a feeling that the night was going to turn out as good or better than they ever imagined, and when their clothes were dry and ready to go, they turned to me and asked me to please take them off.</p> <p>The three of them got up close with all their clothes and they all started to get naked while they waited for me.</p> <p>“Don’t you think it seems weird that we’d all just have that thing on again when we went to bed!” I asked.</p> <p>“Well, at my age, I don’t think we’d care to go that far if it was only a joke.”</p> <p>“Well, if you’re sure you’re ok with what we’ve done and if you guys liked it, don’t you feel too guilty about it?” Sue asked.</p> <p>“I guess not, it’s not like you guys will be doing anything else, are you sure you’re ok with it? I mean, if it’s just a joke you’re sure it’s no big deal, ok?”</p> <p>“Don’t be silly,” Jason chimed in. “We’re just going to have a little fun with each other.”</p> <p>We all looked at each other and Jason and I broke our eye contact and looked at him and he looked at me. I could tell he was not all that sure but figured we could go with our instincts and see what happened.</p> <p>I put on the biggest grin on my face and Jason looked at me in a funny way. Sue followed his glance and we were laughing and talking about how much we wanted to strip down there to nothing that night but we knew that the girls would not care about us being nude in a bunch when we’d even seen a little more.</p> <p>When the three of us were all naked and in the open, we couldn’t see much and just about everything on. Sue was not nude except for a black silk robe, which she was wearing and her shoes were off, but I couldn’t see what she was doing under her robe. Sue did have on a very short black leather miniskirt and she walked about three feet with—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
