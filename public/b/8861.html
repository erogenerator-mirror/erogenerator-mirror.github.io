She pulled her hand back to her thigh almost as if afraid that his presence was going to stop it, but that was no doubt a result of the way his cock was growing inside his pants. Even though she couldn't see it in his pants and could feel it against her leg she felt the sensation from his body. She could now feel the tiniest trepidation in her stomach and the tiniest excitement. She looked back down at him and saw that he was now stroking his cock through the pants. It stood up out the top of the pants making it look enormous in the dim light. She quickly reached around and grabbed it by the base and then let go of the tiniest bit of control he had left. She was holding out on her own power to make him cum if only she could do it in that position. At this her control left her feeling helpless and very exposed. She didn't know if she could take that much. She knew there was no way she could stop him once he had started and she knew she wanted to have him. She had seen too many movies, and all of them had been made more extreme by their lust and more aggressive, but none seemed to allow for her to get used to them, so she was determined to make him cum.</p> <p>It dawned on her what she was doing. It just felt so much better and it was all so much better to her. It was as if she were the leader in a war of attrition with her own personal, self-controlled, orgasm. She looked at the cock now and found it almost identical to the one from last week, but no deeper. She let go of it and was mesmerized by its strength and how it made her feel. She then took it into her mouth and sucked on it hard, tasting the manly taste of his manhood. She could feel herself getting close. She sucked hard and pulled away slowly and took a deep breath.</p> <p>"Oh, baby, yes. That feels so good. Don't stop, don't stop," Dianne's pleas were loud and urgent, and now that the moment had passed her body felt the need to join in.</p> <p>She didn't want to stop. She was very hungry, so very ready to taste and feel this man she had never met. The heat and taste of him was making her so hot, and so ready. She felt like her body was on fire and wanted everything it could offer.</p> <p>Dianne again bent and sucked on one of her fingers and then took it into her mouth. She sucked and licked it for a little while and then she looked her lover in the eyes. She saw a look in his eyes, a look that told her she was the perfect partner. It also told her he wanted her as deeply as possible in the way they were making love.</p> <p>Dianne then took her lips away from Peter's cock. It was now fully erect with a large wet drop of pre-cum forming the tip. "Mmm," she purred as she licked her finger, "you taste as good as you tasted me, sweetheart. Would you like to taste me, sweetheart?" she asked, as though she were asking for his approval.</p> <p>Peter didn't have to say anything. "Yes, baby, I want to taste you. Please, please taste you. I want to feel everything you have to offer."</p> <p>Dianne smiled at her lover and then smiled and kissed her neck. "Oh, that's good," she said as she took Peter's hand and put it between her legs. She then reached for and took his cock in her hand and started stroking it as she bent down to lick all of the pre-cum that was still forming. She could tell from the movement of both her hands that he was very excited and that he also liked what she was doing. She could tell that he was very close, and she smiled at him. She took his cock back into her mouth and did her very best to bring him to the brink.</p> <p>But he was going too far. She could feel his hands on her head trying to pull her down onto him. She smiled and looked up at him, a smile that said he would have to do something very drastic to prevent this, so she let go of his cock and pulled away from him and stood up while looking down at him. "Mmm," she said. "I think I know the way to a man's heart." And she then turned and walked slowly back towards the bar. He followed and got to be a step behind her without knocking her against the door.</p> <p>He moved his hands back and forth from her body, each time feeling her warmth. "Mmm," she moaned, and his hands slid back up her sides. "Yes, sweetheart, do it. Taste me. Don't worry about anything."
