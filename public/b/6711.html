He had just had a brief orgasm and she realized he needed it. "I think we might also need to make a good time this afternoon," she murmured, taking him in her arms, "but first, you need to clean up. I have errands to run. You know, in your office tomorrow."</p> <p>He nodded, still somewhat unsure what to wear. The question was, what was he to wear?</p> <p>"Here, come in with me," she said, taking him into her arms again, her heels digging into his ankles, "And we can go to the restaurant you're always complaining about. There are a lot of good things on the menu today."</p> <p>He followed her out of the apartment and in the parking lot. He could not imagine a better day for having been waiting for her. He couldn't believe how gorgeous his mother looked naked except for her heels, and that he was already fucking his teacher. The feeling made him even harder, and his cock hardened with each step.</p> <p>He walked in front of her, and leaned over to kiss her. She was wearing a blouse and bra that matched her skirt, but he could have sworn he had seen the bra at school. The thought of her wearing another man's bra excited him. He kissed her again, this time deeper, and she responded against him with her mouth, her kiss more passionate. He could feel her tongue pressing against his teeth and he parted them a little.</p> <p>She had a bra on underneath her shirt, the same style as what she wore earlier in the day, but that matched the way he and she were dressed in the apartment. He slid the blouse off her shoulders, allowing it to hang open over her breasts. She had not worn a bra since they walked into the apartment, and he wondered for the first time if she had ever worn one for him.</p> <p>He took his shirt off as she kissed his neck, and then his chest. When his fingers slipped beneath the waistband he was surprised to find she had a garter belt as well. Her hands were all over his nipples, but he could not decide which end he liked better.</p> <p>She stood up and kissed his shoulders, his chest, and finally on the lips, and they exchanged tongues. Without realizing it, he moved to kiss her on the mouth. He had never imagined kissing a woman with a tongue in her mouth, so full and exciting.</p> <p>They kissed in an open-mouthed, hungry embrace, and he felt her breasts pressing into his chest. She broke from the kiss and knelt, her blouse falling open and she removed her bra so he could take it off as well. He knelt while she took off the last of his clothes and kissed her mouth again, again, and again, and finally she broke away, panting from her excitement.</p> <p>"God," she breathed, "I thought I would never get the chance to taste you. You are so beautiful." She knelt once more and he slid his boxer shorts down his legs. She took a second to look at his cock which she estimated to be twelve to twelve inches. When she reached out a hand to touch him with her thumb, he surprised her by dropping to his side. He put her hand back on his cock and she put just the very tip into her lips. She took the whole thing in with a soft pop, and he felt a little more in her mouth as she took it all.</p> <p>When he had a good six and a half inches of cock in her mouth, she began to pull it slowly back out. She looked at him, and he saw her tongue running over the side of his dick, almost licking it. They began to kiss passionately, the touch and sounds of their tongues and lips making his skin tingle and his balls twitch, the heat of her mouth and throat, and the feel of her hand on his cock.</p> <p>She sat back on her heels and spread her legs wide. He moved in and kissed her thigh, from just above her knee to its center. He ran his tongue slowly along the inside of her lips, stopping to taste one last time. She had her fingers on her nipples and he could now see her sex through the open door of herself. He ran his tongue along the lip of her vagina, just below the clitoris, and she cried out.</p> <p>"Oh, I love you."</p> <p>He sucked her pussy lips into his mouth, his lips wrapped around her clit as his tongue and his head slipped back and forth and then up and then down in short strokes. She moaned and thrust her hips up against his face as he moved on her. She had never felt this passionate, and the way she was feeling herself was almost like love-making.
