"And I'd have been more than happy to make love to you."</p> <p>"Oh, thank god," she murmured, "What was all about you?" After a moment, she started to look genuinely puzzled. "Well?" came another.</p> <p>"I had a feeling that something was going to happen between us."</p> <p>"That was so nice," she said, sounding a little surprised. "I mean, I kind of liked how it seemed that you and I were able to be in the same room together."</p> <p>John smiled. "So did I."</p> <p>"I've never had a girl in the same room with me before," she said, "I was a little shocked."</p> <p>"Oh, I didn't know that," he said, pulling her into his lap. "And you still feel so warm, I could keep making love to you."</p> <p>"Oh, John," she said, "I feel so good about myself sometimes."</p> <p>"Mmhmm. That I must do?"</p> <p>"It's not just a fantasy," she said, "It's very real, actually."</p> <p>"It's really sexy, isn't it," he said. "You really are a beautiful girl."</p> <p>"You too," she said, "and you're all I think about."</p> <p>John chuckled. "And I think you're beautiful."</p> <p>"Really?" she said, trying to sound a little taken with him. "I've never had that before," she said, "I guess it kind of freaked me out."</p> <p>"Ohhh, don't worry," John said, rubbing his cheek on her stomach, "I've dreamed of you ever since I got here, and I was hoping to be able to look at you again."</p> <p>After a moment of being concerned by John's suddenness, she just looked at him, almost with resignation. "Are you still a virgin?" She asked.</p> <p>He looked surprised, and kind of embarrassed. "No. I'm pretty sure..." he said, looking away, "...that I haven't had anyone before," he said, putting his hand over hers. "But I'm sure glad you're here, and not just for me." He winked. "I'd love to be able to make you feel good again."</p> <p>Lenny laughed again. "It's not just the sex, John," she said. "It's the whole experience."</p> <p>The next morning, Lenny was still in bed when John woke up. He had no idea when he came back to consciousness at all, but it didn't feel like it.</p> <p>He did groggily open his eyes and, for the second time that morning, he caught her in an arm-lock, and she looked so incredibly beautiful standing over him.</p> <p>"It's too bad I haven't worn a nightie," she said with a smile, "or I'd lose it for sure."</p> <p>"You do realize that we probably wouldn't even have gone through with it," he said with a chuckle. Lenny just looked at him, and he watched her, a little uncertain. He felt nervous as well as excited. They had talked about each other a lot over the years, but had been so happy to talk about their lives. Lenny liked to travel a lot, and was looking forward to going out for coffee, and if she and John were going to spend their first evening together, she had to feel as close to him as possible.</p> <p>"Where are you?" he asked, finally turning over onto his back.</p> <p>"I'm over in the kitchen," she said, "what about you?"</p> <p>John smiled as he felt the bed shift. He felt a little awkward about it, though, but Lenny was the person he felt more comfortable being in bed with - and he hoped that she felt the same way.</p> <p>"Come take a shower," he said, "you're coming with me, right?"</p> <p>"OK," Lenny said, "and I'll take a shower right afterwards."</p> <p>John got up, pulled a bathrobe on, and opened the bathroom door. "Come on," he said, "I'll go get dressed."</p> <p>Lenny sat up a little, looked at him.</p> <p>"Are you really staying up all night, again?" she asked, looking a little hurt.</p> <p>"I was hoping you'd like it," he said, "because I think you'll really enjoy it," he added with a chuckle.
