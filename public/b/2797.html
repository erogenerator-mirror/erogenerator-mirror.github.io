You're making me sleepy," she smiled.</p> <p>Sandy walked up to the bed and lay down. As she closed her eyes, she felt her robe being opened and then opened them again. She wasn't sure who else she expected, and then again, she hoped that she wasn't the only one to see it.</p> <p>"You sleep well, you have a lovely body, and I'm certain that David is glad that we got together," he said as he climbed on the bed beside her.</p> <p>He gently stroked her bare back, running his fingers down to her buttocks and then back up, slowly tracing the lines of her shapely skin. Her hands rested on his strong chest as she wrapped her legs around him, her heels softly clumping on the wood floor.</p> <p>She couldn't help but notice the contrast between her milky skin and the large black phallus that was now standing proudly at full mast, her swollen labia parted in front of it. She could feel her own hands cupping her breasts, her breasts that she usually didn't wear much attention to, now that she realized that they would be there tonight also.</p> <p>She smiled at his soft, gentle touch as she ran her fingers over the muscles in his shoulders and arms. She turned her head sideways and could only watch as his eyes slowly drifted down her body.</p> <p>His eyes traveled down to her groin, where she felt two of his fingers gently stroking her open lips, opening them slightly to accept the swollen member, she shuddered as they touched against her clit, making her shiver in her sleep. She leaned her head back, opening her legs more as she felt his hands lightly stroke her body, running his fingers up and down the lips of her vagina.</p> <p>She had only had one finger in her a few months so her pussy was very wet and she felt his fingers probe inside, sliding smoothly up and down the length of her, spreading her open before he added a second finger.</p> <p>She closed her eyes and let her head drop on the back of the headboard when she felt his fingers start to push up against her opening.</p> <p>"Let's see what happens," he whispered as he gently pushed his fingers forward.</p> <p>She felt herself open slowly to her touch, opening up to let the tip of his fingers enter, he stopped as her body began to open, allowing her vaginal canal to accommodate his fingers. When he was fully inside, she let her body relax enough that it let him have a turn inside it.</p> <p>He continued to push into her slowly, trying to make her feel every last millimeter of him and hearing the sound of her moans of lusty pleasure as he filled her to the hilt.</p> <p>Sandy let both her hands run up and down his back, feeling the muscles rippling beneath her fingers and feeling his thickened cock against her stomach. She could feel herself getting wetter as her own hands went to his buttocks, her body shivering under his, but he took it as a sign that he needed to move to her front.</p> <p>He slid from the bed, moving to lay on his back. He spread his legs, his eyes fixed on hers, with the head of his cock touching the lips of her cunt. She leaned forward, holding the back of the headboard with both hands, feeling the warmth of him as her moist lips stretched around him.</p> <p>He moved his hands up to her shoulders, the backs of his fingers lightly brushing against her bra strap. He moved his hands over her, her shoulders, her breasts, her stomach, her thighs before pushing both his hands down.</p> <p>She let her hands move off of his shoulders and down his strong chest, feeling him move his arms behind his head, her breasts almost touching his face as his chest rose and fell with his breathing. She felt his hard cock pressing against her pubic hair, feeling his weight pressing her down against the headboard. His cock was just beyond her vagina as she moved her legs forward, letting them hang on the sides of his.</p> <p>Sandy felt that he was slowly pulling his cock back, allowing just its head to slide back out, the last bit of pressure from his penis pressing hard against her pubes. It was a feeling that she felt every day, feeling him pushing and sliding against her.</p> <p>It was a feeling that she hadn't forgotten, a feeling that she had never had, and now it felt like she was experiencing in person. She leaned back a bit more, looking down as it seemed on her face.</p> <p>"You feel amazing, lover," she smiled.</p> <p>"Mmmmmm, thank you," he whispered, the sounds of his nameâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
