No problem. How are you," I said.</p> <p>The clerk's eyes darted back and forth at my boobs.</p> <p>"I'm okay, thanks. I know I would have to, wouldn't I? No, I guess you'll have to ask. Why?" she said.</p> <p>"Where are they?" I asked.</p> <p>We walked out of the store and headed the forty-five.</p> <p>I was still nervous about what I was wearing. I was still on the inside of my thigh; and I was only wearing four-inch heels and a push-up bra. And she was so gorgeous, that even wearing makeup did nothing to deter me from wearing something else.</p> <p>We went to the car in the parking lot, and took the elevator to the parking garage for the underground garage. I sat next to her and handed her my keys.</p> <p>"Can I help you with something, now?" I asked.</p> <p>She took my hand.</p> <p>"Here, let me go get them," I said.</p> <p>I went to the office that was in back. I took out the keys and handed it to the clerk then looked at my watch. Twenty minutes had passed and she was putting it into her car, and then the elevator.</p> <p>"I have to get a meeting with clients," she told me as I put her keys in the ignition.</p> <p>I walked to my car and got in, pulling out into traffic on the interstate. We drove for five minutes, both getting tired. Twenty minutes, I thought, and then I saw the lights on in the back of my car and felt the seat belt catch.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" she said.</p> <p>"Uh, um, um I'm not supposed to be here. They had to call the owner and cancel," I said.</p> <p>"You could have called the owner to cancel or they'd have come to your hotel," she said. "What if they knew you hadn't got the keys?" she said, pointing to my keys.</p> <p>"I don't know. What if they knew what I'm doing," I said.</p> <p>I closed my door and got out of the car and opened her door. She got out in a hurry. I put my keys in the ignition, grabbed my purse and got in, closing my door and sitting there. I felt myself starting to relax as the car started to move but the lights still on. Twenty-five minutes.</p> <p>I was tired myself, tired of thinking about what was going to happen to me. I was tired of being told what to wear. I was tired again of feeling like I really was being used.</p> <p>She came running at me, grabbed my necktie and kissed me for what felt like an eternity.</p> <p>"Honey, I hope you have got some kind of good sense about your feelings. You don't have to do anything with a guy, just let him do it his way." She said</p> <p>"Yeah. I thought we could try," I said, smiling and trying to say something, but just couldn't. My words were lost in her long, beautiful kiss.</p> <p>"Do you always have to drive yourself home alone after we go out?" she said softly as she pulled the tie from my neck.</p> <p>I smiled and said,</p> <p>"That doesn't seem kind to me. Why don't we go up to my bedroom. I feel that way."</p> <p>We got out of the car and went through the garage and to the front door. She unlocked it, put her key in the lock and took my hand to lead me inside.</p> <p>"Come on. I'm tired of you fighting me like this. We have a lot of talking ahead of us," she said.</p> <p>I looked at her and smiled.</p> <p>"Do you need some kind of help? You know I'm not doing this alone."</p> <p>"Come on, baby. Please. Can we try again for real?" she said. "You know I'm all yours," she said, taking my hand and leading me to the bedroom.</p> <p>We went into the bedroom and she stood with her hands on her hips.</p> <p>"Come on," I said.</p> <p>She kissed me then took my hands and ran them up and down her body. I cupped her breasts, feeling her nipples get hard. She pushed my hands down to her waist and raised herself to my hands. I pushed the blouse out of her skirt and let it float on to the floor. She was wearing a black lace bra, matching black thong and high-heeled shoes.
