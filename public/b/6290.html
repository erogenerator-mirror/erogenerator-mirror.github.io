"No one would... you should stop..." Alex tried to pull her head away from his cock, as she began to protest. "I just... need..." Alex stopped her and brought her head back to look into his eyes, and Alex continued, "I just... want you to be able to have fun. I know when I lose control."</p> <p>"Ok, um... when will... when will we... umm... do this?" she asked. Alex didn't answer. "This is between us," Alex said.</p> <p>"Don't worry, I'll have more fun."</p> <p>"Please don't tell anyone-"</p> <p>"Yes, but you must promise to only tell me when you are close, ok?"</p> <p>"I promise, I swear it!"</p> <p>"You better make sure, I won't ever hear from you again."</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>After the shower, Alex got dressed, and told Karen her he'd be by her house in just a little bit, and would be right back. She promised to call her a bit more when she got home, but never stopped using the vibrator, just like he had.</p> <p>Alex was sitting on her bed in just a pair of white panties, watching tv, when he saw her walk in. He smiled then said "You have come again, aren't you?"</p> <p>She looked at him before leaning over and kissing him softly. Alex smiled and let out a low chuckle, before he sat back down. He turned the tv off, before heading to pick up his bag and bags. He went to the bathroom to use the toilet, and grabbed some fresh towels, before heading for the door, he started to put the towels on the floor.</p> <p>"Wait a second," Alex yelled over the noises of the bathroom.</p> <p>He saw her standing outside, staring at him. "Alex... are... are you still there?" she asked.</p> <p>"No, just in my bag." Alex reached inside the bag, and extracted a bag, to find one of the vibrators, that he kept secret in his pants. "No," Alex said, pointing to the other vibrator, "this one is in the bathroom." He went back into the bathroom, leaving the door open, and grabbed a towel, and put on his pants, before turning the television back on.</p> <p>He walked back outside, and sat down as the two of them talked. Karen had stopped using the vibrator on herself, the look on her face was something Alex hoped for.</p> <p>"Hah! I could think of a lot worse scenarios where... and I have one that you can imagine!" Alex said.</p> <p>"What? You really want to try them?"</p> <p>"Of course I do."</p> <p>"Well, I'll just see if you've got any toys."</p> <p>"Sure," said Alex looking back at her with a smile.</p> <p>Karen went out of the bathroom, and came back in just a towel, "Well, I've got a few of my vibrators, that would be great."</p> <p>Alex went and picked up a pink vibrator, and walked into the living room, as he watched Karen walking back towards him, with the vibrator sticking out of her, and was touching herself.</p> <p>"Hey!" Said Alex, slapping Karen on the ass. "Oh, hey, I got this in," Alex reached inside his pockets, and took out a box, and placed it on the table. He had her bend over just a bit so it could be in her pussy.</p> <p>Karen quickly complied, before Alex could move a muscle. "Can I play with this?" she asked. "I really need to cum," she said, grabbing and squeezing it.</p> <p>"Ok," said Alex. "But the first one, to go, must first be worn to you bedroom by two." Alex opened the box, and started to put it in the air.</p> <p>Karen quickly pulled him away. "Oh no, no, I don't want to do that!"</p> <p>"You're going to have to." Alex opened the box, and began to put the clothes he had left inside it on her. But Alex interrupted her, and took it out of his pocket.</p> <p>"Please, I can't-"</p> <p>"Yes, it's ok," said Alex, "as long as you keep it." Alex handed Karen a vibrator, and asked her to try it on herself.</p> <p>"What..." she started to say, before Alex put the vibrator on her. Alex quickly reached over her head, and put it on her left breast.</p> <p>"Hey," said Alex. "My turn."
