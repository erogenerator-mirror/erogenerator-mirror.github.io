"I'm not gay," I tell myself.</p> <p>"You should feel free to be yourself. There are so many things you can do," he says.</p> <p>I tell him that I don't want to, and he starts to unbutton my shirt. I tell him about a month ago when a few guys took pictures, all of which I had taken but one, the one with a shot of me getting off. The one with me holding the camera up to make sure I wasn't giving it to anyone. He likes my face, but he doesn't like my tits. I tell him I never liked him and how much older they are. I tell him about that, which isn't true. I'm a happily married 35 years old woman with a baby. I'm proud of who and what I am.</p> <p>"Don't tell anyone, OK?" he says. "It will be our secret," he says with a smile, giving me a hug and kiss on the cheek.</p> <p>As we walk past his house, we come to a stop at his house and we kiss for a short while.</p> <p>I have never seen a more passionate kiss, one so sensual and full of tongue. I feel like I might faint, so he takes me up to his bedroom. It's warm in there, his soft bedding beneath us. He pulls me on top of him, holding me close against his strong body. He moves his hands under my shirt and strokes my bare, firm breasts, pinching my already hard nipples. I let out a gasp and grind myself against his hips. I'm turned on, too, and there's no stopping me. I'm so turned on, and it feels as though my orgasm is about to happen. I can't believe it.</p> <p>"I want you to keep touching me," I said. "You're too much!"</p> <p>"I'm not going to stop! Just keep letting me touch you," he said. "I can see a part of your brain working at the same time. Tell me more," he said. I nodded in agreement. We lay on his bed and I ran my hands up and down his shoulders, my fingernails tickling his bicep and the tops of his small feet. I kissed them, and then ran my tongue over his bare skin in the V. The feel of his body, and how relaxed, aroused I felt, makes my heart hammer in my chest as I caress those large, firm, powerful feet and thighs. I slide them higher and higher until I reach his inner thighs. I kiss, licked, and suck on his tender flesh. It feels like he moans and he shivers on top of me. I spread his legs wide and bury my face in his strong thighs. I kiss and suck on his hairy, turgid, hairy crotch, running my tongue over and around his large, fat hairy balls. It feels amazing, as if I just touched them and I can't get enough. I start to lick and kiss his scrotum, making his hard cock throb and jump in my hand.</p> <p>When he stops me, I lie back. I spread my legs, inviting him to explore, to taste, to touch, to suck and kiss. I reach down slowly, holding him at his base so he doesn't have to work up to taking the first step. He's not that inexperienced, but after about a minute I wrap my fingers around him and slowly begin pumping up and down on him. I've got him right where I want him, and I like where I'm going with him. His cock is standing straight up between his legs, pointing to the ceiling. I reach my hands around the base of it so I can put the rest of him inside me with a squeeze of my vagina. He fucks me hard with his cock.</p> <p>It's like a long, slow, long, powerful cock fucking. Like his hands are controlling me, holding me and rubbing my body against his. I want to feel every ridge on his fat, veiny shaft with the walls of my cunt, as though I've been in heat all day. I just lie there and let him fuck and fuck me like that. I'm in a hurry to have my climaxes, and so am he. I don't usually climax too quickly. It was hard. It was different. I can go as long as I want. I cum and cum and cum into the sheets with a sense of completion. I hear and feel the deep rumbling in his gut and chest. I feel the soft hair surrounding his cock, just the way I remember it, in the dark of a room, where it belonged and didn't belong. I feel his cock stiffen up, and he grasps my hips, holding me in a deep, penetrating grip. He lets go of me, he's goingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
