They were lost in their own world and yet, all too quickly, they were at their limit.</p> <p>"Cum," she commanded softly. "Cum."</p> <p>At last they came together in a rush of white hot release. Both had been dreaming of being married and yet, they were no less in the moment than now.</p> <p>They looked down into each others eyes.</p> <p>"That was beautiful," she said. "And just like that," she continued as she stroked him lightly. "So beautiful and yet, so much like a first time."</p> <p>He smiled.</p> <p>"Now I'm going to suck you, baby. I want to make sure you're ready. I want to feel you cum in my mouth."</p> <p>"That's so warm," he smiled, "like nothing I've felt before."</p> <p>She kissed him lightly on the mouth as she caressed him gently. "It's my pleasure. I love to make the most of you," she whispered as she kissed him again.</p> <p>And then she lay back on the pillows they'd just enjoyed together, as he sat between her legs again, looking down at her. "Suck me, baby. Taste me, taste me. I want to feel your mouth and tongue on me," she said. "But I'm not sure if you understand."</p> <p>"I understand," he answered.</p> <p>Then she kissed him again.</p> <p>"Suck me, baby. Make me cum in your face with your pretty sweet lips. Make me feel good," she said. "I love to be able to say it when I'm feeling good."</p> <p>She was his first and only lover, and they had no more lovers than the one they'd just had, the one they shared in the hot dark world of eroticism and sexual excitement.</p> <p>As they were both still trying to understand what that special moment was, he slid down the bed and crawled over to take her between his lips.</p> <p>"It's just like I remembered," she said, as they kissed again. "It's very, very special. It's just you and me."</p> <p>Their kisses went on for a long time; he explored her body and breasts and hips, enjoying the smell and feel of her in his mouth, feeling the texture of her hair on his face and her lips and hands. Her legs were wrapped around him as she writhed and moved against him. As he began kissing down across her stomach, he knew that this was where the evening would end. He was going to have the night of his life.</p> <p>He moved down, as well, and kissed her thighs, just above and below her knees.</p> <p>"Oh God, Jim," she sighed. "That feels so good. Please don't stop. No, I can't."</p> <p>He kissed the inside of her thighs again, as gently as before. Now he could feel the delicate texture of her pussy, which was still tender from their time apart.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" she asked. "You're going to make me cum."</p> <p>He kissed her pussy lips again, just above and below the outer lips.</p> <p>"Oh God. Oh God, yes," she moaned. "Keep kissing me, keep kissing me...I love you, I love you..."</p> <p>He slipped a third finger inside her and began fucking her deeply. She gasped and thrust her hips upward into his fingers. It felt so good...</p> <p>"Oh, yes...that's so good. Don't stop. Don't stop..."</p> <p>Jim began slowly fucking her with his hand. He felt her excitement begin, and his cock was throbbing with lust. He slipped a fourth finger inside her wetness and began stroking her clit. Her cries increased and he sucked her clit into his mouth.</p> <p>"God, I'm cumming!" she cried as she clutched him tightly and began shaking and twitching, with her entire body shaking and quivering. Jim sucked her clit into his mouth, as hard as he could stand it and pressed his lips hard against her.</p> <p>"Oh Yes!" she moaned, as she held his head against her crotch, as she pulled his head against her with all her might.</p> <p>When she calmed down, she pulled his hips against hers.</p> <p>"Oh God..." she gasped, "that was so wonderful...please don't ever change anything between us. I need you."</p> <p>"I won't unless you want me to, baby," he said softly in her ear.</p> <p>"No," she moaned, "please, don't ever change anything between us. Please, now."</p> <p>He kissed her gently on the cheek and then rose to his knees. His cock was still hard and throbbingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
