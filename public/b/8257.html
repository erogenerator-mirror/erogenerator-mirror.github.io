After only a moment, he pulled her face up on her knees and slid himself all the way in and out of her mouth, the tip of him hitting the back of her throat. She moaned around him as he pumped in and out of her mouth, her hands gripping the bed sheets for support. He pulled out and rolled her body so her back was up against the headboard and she put her feet on the bed, opening herself up to him. He leaned over and nibbled her ear, licking and nibbling on the other ear lobe as his other hand moved to cup her breast. She squealed and bucked her hips to the rhythm he was moving, making it difficult to keep pace on him, but she didn't have anything stopping him.</p> <p>"Ah ah," he growled into her ear as he thrust himself deep into her with one last thrust. He pulled out almost all the way and thrust back in. He kept his hand clamped on his cock as he slid himself back into her again and again. She couldn't even do a grunt of objection. He pounded her ass with an intensity that shook her. He held a fistful of wavy, blonde strands and yanked them out of her hair as he leaned over her. He grabbed her hair and shoved his cock all the way down her throat, sending her body into a violent spasm of ecstasy as she gagged. He slapped her face and laughed with delight as he drove his cock deep into her throat once more, filling her throat while he pinched and pulled her nipples.</p> <p>He laughed, enjoying the sight as his cock pistoned in and out of her mouth, but stopped and pulled out when she started to protest. She took in a fresh lungful of air before he plunged back in. She tried to breath as his thrusts began to accelerate, the pleasure of having her so full and in need. He started in and out of her mouth with every stroke, letting his orgasm build up over her, until he pulled her hair back and she started to lose control. He was pulling her hair back, but he was pulling her back so that they were both face to face on the bed. He kept a grip on her hair as she came, pushing back at him as he rammed into her, making her body jolt and spasm as if she had just run a marathon. He was pulling her hair back as her head came up off the bed, making it necessary to grab a handful of those hair again just to keep her head still in place.</p> <p>"Are you all right, baby?" he asked her.</p> <p>"Yes...oh yes," she replied with the sound of joy in her breath as she gasped through gritted teeth.</p> <p>When he came, his cock was still buried in her mouth, shooting a load of semen deep into her as the intensity grew. She tried to swallow him down and keep up, but some spunk started to escape her lips. She managed to get most of it in and kept swallowing, but some went up her nose and on to her chin. She sucked on it and looked up at him, her hands clutching the bed sheets. He smiled down at her, her face drenched with cum. He wiped his cock on her cheek and moved off of her. She put her hand over her mouth as a sign to not speak. She looked up at him in wonder, but realized that he was still out and out in her. She sat up and got her breath back, and then started to say something, but the thought vanished quickly as she looked down at him. He stood up and leaned into her, kissing her as he thrust his limp cock into her and rolled her onto her belly.</p> <p>"I can't hold my cum too."</p> <p>He said, "Let me get it." And he slid himself down her and slid his cock into her pussy. She squealed in pleasure, though it couldn't have been more than a groan of need. He was still moving inside of her so he pumped himself in and out, her body quivering at the full experience when he pulled out of her. He got off the bed and moved around to the side of it. He pulled a handful of sheets back to her and sat in the middle of the bed, propped up on the pillows.</p> <p>"It's time for you to come home, honey," he told her. She nodded quickly, still in a daze over what just happened. He kissed her lips, and worked his way down her neck, sucking on each of her nipples and working his way down to her pussy. When she couldn't say no anymore, he got on his knees and sucked his cum out of her pussy. He licked the mixture off her folds, loving the way she tasted. He got off the bed and got his clothesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
