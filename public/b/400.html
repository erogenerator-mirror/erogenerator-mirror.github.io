I'm sorry I haven't been at your beck and call but I hope this changes your mind.” He says and walks off.</p> <p>I'm confused. He never talks about other people as part of this conversation, is he trying to say there is no reason why I should not be comfortable with him having his company?</p> <p>I do have to admit to myself that I was kind of turned on by him being around. This was just beginning to become a routine, something that should not be seen as the oddest of all, but that is not my business.</p> <p>“I’m sorry if you are uncomfortable with that,” he says.</p> <p>I give him a slight smile and nod, “it's not my business to be uncomfortable with you being around you.”</p> <p>I can’t believe how much I am liking him. I can’t believe his eyes, dark brown but just as dark, with that kind of light that you can see in a mirror, just a hint of his features.</p> <p>“Thank you. I, well, uh, ah, have been thinking about your request,” he starts.</p> <p>“Oh?” I ask.</p> <p>“You know I was thinking to myself about your fantasy about being with a man that has, like… a lot to do with you,” he says and I can hear the grin in his voice, “and I could tell by the way your eyes were looking at me that it was, well, sort of a turn on.”</p> <p>“Uh huh. I like that,” I respond and sit down in His lap.</p> <p>“And you liked it, wasn’t that good?” he asks</p> <p>“Yeah,” I reply, with a smile, “It was kinda nice.”</p> <p>“Did you like the fantasy? If you do, tell me you liked it and I will leave you alone. Don’t worry, I won’t talk about it again.” He says and I nod. We both seem to be smiling. “And you didn’t answer my question, were you uncomfortable with the fantasy?” He asks.</p> <p>“Um… I was…”</p> <p>“Yes? Why.”He asks.</p> <p>“I don’t know what I liked about it and how I was not enjoying it. I guess I was afraid you would know or that you would think I was some kind of weirdo. I guess there are a lot of things in life that we all seem to enjoy. But you know how I have been since I left that hotel,” my words hang in the air.</p> <p>“I understand, but there is so much more to you than just what just happened here. You are a gorgeous young woman. You were the first man that I’ve had the pleasure of meeting,” He speaks as if he would have the words. I stare into his face, then lean in to kiss him again, “I'm just glad it is over.”</p> <p>And the kiss is over. I am beginning to feel as if our chemistry has just been sealed away. The passion of our first time is still between us and we can’t be mad at the kiss.</p> <p>When we finally pull apart, there is a smeared smirk on his face. “Wow. You really know how to kiss,” he says and reaches over and pulls me close again.</p> <p>“I better get back to you guys,” I say as I get up and walk on out the room. I can’t find any sense of reality in those words, but I can guess that if I get out of a relationship where we are still having sex, it will be different.</p> <p>The door closes on us, leaving behind my memory of our first kiss, “Yeah, I could tell how you liked him. Did you like it?” he asks.</p> <p>“I still don't believe it happened,” I say.</p> <p>“I told you you’re beautiful. I don’t think someone in our profession is going to tell you no.”</p> <p>He smiles knowingly. “I liked it very much and if you were uncomfortable with it, that’s probably why I felt so uncomfortable.”</p> <p>“I liked it. It was kind of weird. It was hard to explain because he was very cute and—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
