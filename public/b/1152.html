I said.</p> <p>"I want to see her ass, if she does, I'll take off her blindfold, I think it might help her out" she said.</p> <p>I pulled my cock out of her mouth. "Look what you have already done to me, give him some credit." She laughed and came down on my shaft. At first, she was able to deep throat me, but after a while she started to gag and had to move back some. For a while she worked around the girth and head, then came time to take it all inside her once again. She started slow as she got used to my massive length inside her hot wet cavity, and then just went wilder. She went on for a while, and after several minutes she went over the edge and began to orgasm all over my balls. It was as though she had one long continuous orgasm. I felt my own release start to build inside, so I pulled her off and positioned her on all fours. "Now it is time to be fucked..." I said.</p> <p>"You got it, you dirty fucking son of a bitch." She said "I can't believe I have not had someone to take care of my needs!"</p> <p>Before I could get my pants back up I felt hands all over my now flaccid cock, and they started to massage my sack. "Don't worry about the mess on my cock, I will clean it up later, just take me in hand, and fuck my fist." I told her.</p> <p>She went to the living room and picked up her clothes, and then went into my bedroom. I watched her get dressed. I could only imagine what she was thinking. Finally, she was dressed again, and started to leave the room. I grabbed the remote control and turned on my TV, which was playing something soft and romantic.</p> <p>"This show is the love of my life." I said.</p> <p>"It is? You want to watch her make love to me? Is it good for you?" She asked as she slid a robe off her shoulders.</p> <p>"Yes, it is very... good." I said. I watched her dress again and then watch herself go into the kitchen. When she returned she found me naked on the couch, her robe was back on. She went to start cooking again, and I told her it would be good to help out. She smiled and went to the oven with her back against me. She started with the meat and vegetables and when I had dinner out, I had to admit it was quite a meal. While they cooked I watched her undress, and I could make out her beautiful breasts through her sheer robe, or her bare ass if she looked into the kitchen through the door. I could see through the door a good amount of skin on her body as her nipples were erect, and her legs were smooth and silky. I guess in addition to the food, I also felt more aroused from the sight that I was getting of her.</p> <p>While we were eating, she was teasing me a bit, and it was not long before I came for her. As we had the night before, the main course was prepared, and then we shared a bottle of wine. The dinner began, I was surprised to hear a soft voice. "Did you like the show last night?" She asked. "Yeah..I was a bit nervous, but... thanks." I replied. "Well, have fun tonight." I said as she went back to cooking.</p> <p>We finally got out of bed, and she went back to make us another drink, and after a few glasses of wine we talked some more.</p> <p>"I'm really glad you invited me." She told me.</p> <p>"Me, too" I said. "You were very sweet and inviting, and I think it is about time we met."</p> <p>She smiled and said "We'll just keep going. I love hearing from you, I really want to have more times like this."</p> <p>"Me too," I said, "but I do want to learn the ropes."</p> <p>"I do too," she said, "and if I learn, so-so we will end up as much as I do."</p> <p>As far as kissing for me was concerned, I was ready for more than just a physical feel. "So... you have had one girl before?" I asked. "Yeah. That's right... well, two... I guess" she laughed. "But you have a lot of history with her... but I don't think you will want to hear something like that."</p> <p>She laughed this time, and said "I'm sure you donâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
