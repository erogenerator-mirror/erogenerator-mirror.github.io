We talked about our life for a couple of hours and decided that we didn't have time to go back to the club, at least for now, but that would soon be over.</p> <p>She said we were on our way home and I got up to take my shower. While I was in there, she looked at me with a look of surprise. I was standing under the spray of the shower, looking at her as she watched me. We dried each other off and laughed when we saw we had no underwear, but it didn't surprise us. We toweled off and walked back to the table, only to find it empty. We walked in a daze over to the restroom and started to take our robes down. I had to keep reminding myself that she was a very attractive and desirable woman. If I had been with other men for less time, I would have given her the chance to be intimate with him, but I just couldn't take the chance.</p> <p>I asked whether there had been any action from the table during dinner and she said there had been, but only a little. We started talking about work and she mentioned that she had been wondering if we had a chance to spend more time together. I told her that I thought we would try and maybe catch up over time and talk on things after a while. She said that she was excited if we could do something. We agreed to call later and she disappeared out of the office.</p> <p>Later that night, we had a good time as we talked and teased each other. We kissed and touched each other as we touched each other. She tasted like honey. Her pussy was soft and wet. My cock began to harden as she told me of how much she had enjoyed herself. Her legs spread open and my hand found her dripping pussy and felt her juice. We made some funny noise, like we had been in a 69 position, when I felt her begin to squirm. My cock throbbed as we heard the sound of her wetness and I began to play with it like her pussy. I rubbed her lips in the softness of her soft, furry bush. I slid my hand under her and began rubbing her clit as deep inside her vagina as I could. We had been in an intense 69 session previously and now it was time for fun. We fucked in the middle of the table in the kitchen, while the other couple sat in the adjacent living room. We had no place to go, so we got naked in the bathroom, while I went back and took the same clothes that we had on earlier.</p> <p>We stood facing each other, just a few inches apart, with the water spraying against my face. I was kissing her hard as she felt my hard cock pressed on her thigh. I slid my hand down to feel how wet her thighs were and found her pussy. The lips were already opened, the lips open and dripping wet. I slid my finger deep inside her before I pulled it back out and rubbed her clitoris hard. she exploded right along with me, pushing herself harder against me.</p> <p>"I want you inside," she cried. Her legs were shaking with effort, as she felt the wet feeling run up the shaft of my cock and down to mine. She pushed her mouth further onto mine and continued kissing me.</p> <p>"Please..." I said, knowing she couldn't ask me to put my cock in her, so she couldn't see. But knowing that I didn't even have to ask her what to do.</p> <p>I guided my cock to her opening slowly and then suddenly, the head slipped in and her muscles closed on it. Her body shook as it was filled with my length and heat. She lifted her body slightly, and as if I had a command to her, I slid my cock in to the hilt. My wife never liked to fuck, but this girl had it hard, and she wanted to make it last as long as she could.</p> <p>"This is great" she said. My wife was as sexy and desirable as always, and at that moment, I didn't care, as long as they wanted it. My wife looked at her, as if she realized what she had in mind. I slowly fucked her with long strokes of my hips, while she took her tits in each hand and moved them up and down on the top of my cock. I felt her pussy tighten around my shaft, milking me, taking every inch of me into her. I knew I was going to cum and I was going to make her cum as well with me. I grabbed her by the shoulders with my hands and began to slowly lift her up and down on my cock. Her pussy felt amazing and she moved her hips as I fucked her. I could feel how tight she was and how much she must have enjoyed this for the first timeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
