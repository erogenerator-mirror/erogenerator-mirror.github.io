"I've watched a lot of porn."</p> <p>With my head full of soap, all I could do in response was to nod my head up and down.</p> <p>"That's so good." she purred, and I was still stroking her smooth skin.</p> <p>"Turn onto your stomach and spread your legs," she said, and I obediently rolled over. Her pussy was so tight and warm and I pushed my soapy finger just inside.</p> <p>"Oh yeah, that's good." she sighed, and I slid my finger out, and put it back inside her slippery pussy, pushing it slowly out again until she could accommodate it.</p> <p>"That's nice," she murmured as I pushed it in a few times, and then repeated the motion.</p> <p>"Don't cum yet," she told me, and I groaned like a hungry animal.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" she asked, a little shocked.</p> <p>I nodded.</p> <p>"C'mon, I'm gonna cum," she urged me, and I pulled my finger out of her pussy, pushed hard on that spot she seemed so eager to tickle.</p> <p>"Oh fuck!" A scream ripped from her throat as she came, and I felt her shudder as I continued, stroking more deeply.</p> <p>"You okay?" she asked, her eyes squinting as she tried to hold it back.</p> <p>"Oh god, yes," I said, and she seemed to understand.</p> <p>"What's wrong?" she asked.</p> <p>"Just thinking about how much you made me cum." I answered. "I hope you can imagine how much," she replied, sounding disappointed.</p> <p>She was right.</p> <p>That night was special.</p> <p>Chapter 5: A new perspective</p> <p>"Hey, where are we going?" I asked her, as we got into bed, kissing and fondling.</p> <p>"Just some place special," she said, and then, "Well, I'm not sure exactly what you might like."</p> <p>"Well," I replied, "I'm certainly not going to lie to you."</p> <p>"Don't stop," she replied, and I rolled her over onto her back. She giggled as she felt something I had always wanted, and I reached for it.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" she asked.</p> <p>"Absolutely," I said, and my heart fell right to the floor.</p> <p>"Come on," she urged as she helped me out of my clothes, and I sat between her legs as she pulled them up over her ankles and feet.</p> <p>She pulled down her pajama bottoms, revealing her perfectly shaved pussy, and then her little hooded clit. I could now see the glistening wetness seeping into the puffy labia as my hard cock, wet with her sweet cum, rubbed up and down that crease.</p> <p>"Do you want me," I asked.</p> <p>She smiled. "I don't know," she replied, and then she took my hard cock in her hand.</p> <p>"I want you inside me," she whispered.</p> <p>I put my hands under her butt and lifted her up. She was so hot and snug. I grabbed her butt as she pulled herself up, straddling me, and I pushed inside of her.</p> <p>"Wow, we are so wet," I said as I felt her wet pussy, and the hot slick moisture of her body on me.</p> <p>"I'm so wet," she replied as I continued to lift her up and down on my thick cock.</p> <p>"You feel so good on me," I said, and, as she lifted herself up and down on me, I reached up and fondled her breasts.</p> <p>She pushed me back against the headboard, and I grabbed her hips, and pushed her up and down on my cock.</p> <p>"Are we making out?" she asked, and smiled.</p> <p>"Yes," I answered, as we locked lips and continued to fuck each other.</p> <p>Slowly, she moved her hips and we fucked for a while, and it felt so good.</p> <p>"I want you," she whispered in my ear, the wetness of our kiss making my body shudder.</p> <p>"I want to." I responded.</p> <p>"I want it too," she whispered, and kissed me again.</p> <p>"And I want you, too." I said as we kissed.</p> <p>"I'm not so sure." she replied, her face still flushed.</p> <p>"I just want to know," I answered, and I kissed upâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
