The rest of the day was going to be busy – the girls were going to be with our families as well as getting married. The boys had their own lives to worry about.</p> <p>"So, you boys are all going to be over there?" They nodded.</p> <p>The night before the wedding, I had booked up my place in Montreal, and the boys were getting ready to pull out of town, leaving me a little alone. I turned to the boys, who all had tears of tears streaming down their faces.</p> <p>"I can't go on like this."</p> <p>"Me neither," Eric said. "It's been so long in the past."</p> <p>"Me either."</p> <p>We kissed, but I wasn't quite ready to take that chance.</p> <p>"You said last night that you would let me go on with this marriage."</p> <p>"And that we are getting married together."</p> <p>I frowned.</p> <p>"No. We can't… I mean, I still love you guys…but that means we can't. We don't have the commitment to take this from you, if we don't have the guts."</p> <p>Eric and I hugged each other then took our limos downtown and headed toward the airport. I kissed each of them for letting me down, then asked if they wanted to have a picnic along the way. We went to the bus stop just on the way there and Eric and I sat in the back seats, holding one another tightly.</p> <p>"So, did you know that you guys were going to get marriage cards?" Eric asked, his left breast rubbing against my right arm.</p> <p>"Yes, we did…We're thinking of doing it right now," I said, reaching over to rub my left breast with my right hand, pulling on it to let my erect nipple brush against his bare chest. "Besides, we knew we were going to have some crazy luck tonight!"</p> <p>We returned home to our apartment building and we went inside to grab our things. I checked my watch to see that I could get there in about an hour and then walked up to my room, turning on the light and pulling back the curtains as I walked behind my bed. My heart was racing, my pussy tingling, all at the sight of the lights from the windows on my bedroom. I slipped the gown off my shoulders and let it drop to the floor. The sight of the beautiful breasts standing out proudly, all of them, I thought, the nipples erect, stood out from my chest. I stepped closer to the bed and took one of my nipples between my lips. Eric was behind my, kissing my neck, my breasts. He slid his one hand between my thighs, feeling my juices there. He worked on my nipples until they were hard and stiff, then he bit them lightly, causing a moan to escape as another wave of pleasure ran through me.</p> <p>"Baby, stop teasing me," I moaned as he took his finger and placed it over my throbbing clit. His other hand moved down to grasp my breast. His thumb and forefinger pinched my nipples as he gently rolled them, pinched more, rolled harder, and tweaked them until I had both of them as hard as my clit. I was in heaven, but only got so much satisfaction from giving them pleasure, so I knew we couldn't be together tonight. I knew he could get us back to being single again, if it came with a condition, but would probably just go the easy on sex again and forget about it. I smiled to myself knowing that eventually we were going to have time alone and if we could do it after the wedding, we would just have to wait until later. But, I couldn't be absolutely certain, but it wasn't going to hurt our marriage any less.</p> <p>I felt him between my thighs as I lifted my hips to allow him access, then heard his zipper being pulled down. I lifted one leg, taking his now throbbing cock in hand, and guided it into my opening. I felt the hot, hard pole slide all the way into me without any resistance at all. I began to ride him slowly, moving my hips gently back and forth over his rigid rod. His eyes were closed as he continued to fuck me as my hands moved to caress his chest. He reached one hand to my clit and used one to rub it hard in between thrusts, then ran his finger down the middle of it until he reached the top.</p> <p>"Ohhh, fuck me, sweetheart, I want you to fuck my pussy, cum on me," I moaned. "Do it. Do it, Baby, cum with me."</p> <p>He responded with his throbbing member. I felt it swelling inside of me. Our bodies moved and shook as we approached our peak together. I felt his cock pulse in my ass and knew he was cumming, too—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
