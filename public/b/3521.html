"Would you let me know that your daughter, Julie is going to be in the bathroom at some point, is that okay?"</p> <p>"What would it be like to be with someone new right now?"</p> <p>"There are always guys out there to pick with me," I said with a chuckle. "I'm sure your daughter would love to meet you."</p> <p>"That would be great. And how would you feel about it if she were gone?" she asked.</p> <p>"You have to take care of her then. I don't mind, but that's not a good idea. I don't think she is worth leaving her alone, even if it was for a while."</p> <p>She smiled, knowing, even though I was being a bit too cocky, that it excited me more than anything in the world. I could tell from the look on her face that her daughter was in for a wild weekend. Her smile and the way that she held my hand had me so excited I could feel my orgasm building. I knew what she wanted - to have sex with her daughter! She leaned down and kissed me on the cheek. "Yes, she is okay." Our eyes locked together as we went back to our families.</p> <p>~~~~~~~~~~</p> <p>I was excited at the prospect of seeing Julie again. I was also in danger of falling into a trap. I wasn't sure if I would be able to satisfy our relationship or not. I'd even have to consider asking her to bring a lover home as the last month went by. I just assumed that she would ask me first anyway.</p> <p>I did think briefly about what my mother had said about me. "Be good to her. Be patient and enjoy yourself." That had seemed to work. We always seemed to stay together with the same goals we had for ourselves and our families. It wasn't uncommon to have a little sex at least twice a month. I wasn't much into the whole idea of swinging but I didn't feel I needed to do it anymore, other than when one of my wife's girlfriends brought me home at night, or when she was at lunch.</p> <p>The prospect of seeing her again excited me. And yes, I was sure that she would bring a young man home on her 18th birthday (I had been married for six years.) I didn't realize that it was going to be another sexual weekend. It would be her birthday in another month or two and then she would be away for a few months.</p> <p>I didn't even bother going to her mother. My Mom was pretty pissed at us and would not hear about my relationship with any of her daughter's former lovers. I figured that it might cause a problem if anyone other than my wife was home for a week or two. She would never approve of me sleeping with Julie, even though I had already told her many times, and that she would never understand. I thought it was possible that she might not agree in some way.</p> <p>So I had no problem getting back into dating before the last holiday and we were still having sex every day. That was good because I liked the idea of having sex with somebody else. That is, another woman. That wasn't like Julie, except that I liked the thought of fucking her, which at least seemed to be turning me on. I had never been with a girl, even my own mother, but since Julie was gone I got pretty excited, which, I admit, made sense. My mother was pissed at me too. If she thought that I was having sex with my mother, then she didn't seem to notice. My mother was a total slut; I could tell that from the way she would occasionally make me rub my cock through my pants.</p> <p>I spent the summer going back to work a lot harder than I usually did. Between my new job and summer classes in college, I was able to leave early in the morning and come back around mid-morning to get my work done. I was glad that Julie had moved to my city two weeks before. My classes and my classes were always together.</p> <p>My friends and I had a lot in common but we didn't talk much. I thought we both liked each other and wanted to be friends but neither felt that the other could. Julie and I were both pretty self-conscious about our ages. Her mother's reaction to us wasn't so great. Her mother had been with me for years and still lived with Julie. Julie was 18 and my mother was 20.</p> <p>It was late in the middle of summer when I got back to work. I drove into town and picked up my car. I had never seen Mrs. G., like I did her. She and Julie had been at different schools at one point. I was surprised to find out that she had moved away from her church. She probably got some extra money as my father did. She was just a good friend, whoâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
