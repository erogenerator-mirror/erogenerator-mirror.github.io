"He had to get off work a couple hours ago!"</p> <p>"This is so much too good to be true, but, I'll take you to them, and maybe, have you meet everyone!"</p> <p>"Well, I can't say that I really want to meet you, really, but don't you have to see them first to see if you can. Or, we could meet at the end of this long day of walking."</p> <p>"Yeah, well that sounds like I could go through with it."</p> <p>"Great. How about, let me take you to the bus terminal, and introduce you?"</p> <p>"That sounds good to me."</p> <p>Saffron led her down the steps to where the bus ran. About twenty minutes later, she came out on the right side and took her bags. She walked up the right side again and took her suitcase and opened the door for Gwen. As she held her hand out to her, I took her bag. "Gwen, Gwen?"</p> <p>"Mmm-mm, what is it, Sweetie?" she said to herself.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm Gwen! I'm glad you're at the front!"</p> <p>Gwen gave both her and Saffron a hug. Gwen said "We're going to have so much fun!" She had been so excited at the thought of her being here... it almost caused her to start to blush.</p> <p>We all laughed as we walked out onto the street and went into the main street. The neighborhood was deserted and quiet. Only a few cars could be seen in front and behind us, and there were no signs that anyone might be walking or driving. A few minutes later, all we could hear going on behind us. A car pulled up in front, and in that instant, there was a woman coming her way. A moment later, a male, who had an even nicer, and somewhat larger cock, climbed into the back seat, and was driving off. Saffron and I stopped the bus and walked to the back. Once we settled ourselves in the seats, just inside the circle, we all laughed and shared a private little joke. All of a sudden, the woman appeared, and took Gwen's bag out of the back.</p> <p>"Hear, hear, and feel all of this," she said with a grin as she walked by us. She placed both her bags on the seat. Then, when the woman got to us, she began walking up the stairs to Gwen's room. We all stood to watch.</p> <p>Gwen had gotten the room a couple of sizes bigger by the time she was done with her, and it took her a couple of minutes to get everything set up as she walked by the house. As she had, we could hear her talking with a camera as she climbed the rest of the way up. I could hear some people laughing and talking as Gwen entered the door and went into her room. Shortly after she had left, another person emerged, now naked. She came into view in front of us as she walked by. A moment later, all seven of us came up behind her and embraced her in a long and deep kiss.</p> <p>"It's my turn now," said Saffron. "This is my favorite part of the entire experience. I'm ready to do whatever I want with anything that moves through my mind. I don't want it to stop, just don't stop, or we'll never stop."</p> <p>Gwen looked at me and smiled, "You're not really suggesting that, are you?"</p> <p>"Nope, I just want to be as close to you as I can, feel how close we both are."</p> <p>"And you've got me very well on my way to cumming over here," said Saffron, smiling.</p> <p>Gwen put a finger to her lips, "So how does it feel to really feel me? Feeling me cum like a man?"</p> <p>"Honey, I think it would be nice, just for us all, to do just this a thousand times at one time, but that's up to you."</p> <p>"Sure, I don't have a lot in mind," she said in a matter-of-fact voice.</p> <p>"Well, I do," said Gwen, putting her hand to her mouth.</p> <p>Saffron and I each took Gwen's hand and held it behind her back. Gwen looked at me, and smiled as she continued to hold our fingers in hers, while we talked in a deep and meaningful way.</p> <p>When we'd finished our chat, we sat down in the seats closest to the door, Gwen on my right, and Saffron and myself in the back seat. We started to pick out the most erotic pictures we could take ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
