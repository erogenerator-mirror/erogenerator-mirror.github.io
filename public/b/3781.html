"I guess a little bit... I wasn't trying to seduce you."</p> <p>"That's ok," I said as we climbed the stairs. "I was just a bit of a fool." At the top of the stairs I looked you in the eye and said, "Let's just relax and hit the sack." As we walked towards your room your cheeks flushed red and you laughed nervously before we made a mad mad dash down the hallway.</p> <p>I looked around your room and found your bed, laid out with a pile of pillows on your bed. On it was a note, folded neatly. "Ladies and gentlemen, our special guest has arrived." And with that you were alone in your room. The note read, "Enjoying yourself, I'm sure you will have plenty of opportunities to have some fun tonight, don't worry! I'm sure the boys will like the show you put on for them."</p> <p>I could not help but laugh and you smiled nervously as you thought about the guys. Not wanting to seem too forward, I said, "Well girls, I think we might have to get off of our feet, before they do. We may as well finish what we've started." As we walked slowly over to your bed I told you, "I hope you don't mind, we were on our way to enjoy ourselves!" As you walked over to the bed, as in a very innocent way, I looked at you and said, "I hope you can be sure we won't disappoint you. Now I'm going to start with a good hard cock". You had not noticed that my robe had fallen open, it was draped loosely around my waist and at your direction you could clearly see me rubbing myself as we walked to your bed.</p> <p>I felt so naughty walking to it, knowing that you could see right through it. I was not expecting the fact that you had pulled your robe open, it wasn't all that bad. We walked slowly up to the bed until we just stood in front of your chair, as we did you put one hand on my leg and the other behind my back. "Here we go." You smiled as you said the words and the next thing I know your lips are against mine. There are no words to describe this kiss, the intensity of our kissing and our body heat was almost enough to bring us both to orgasm. You stood up and I leaned back against your chair. You leaned down toward me, parting my lips with your tongue. Your arms went around my waist and your hands began to caress my breast.</p> <p>As you broke our kiss, I reached behind your head and brought your mouth down onto mine. As we kissed, my hands moved up your body, caressing your breasts as we stood there kissing. When our bodies finally broke the kiss I continued to caress them, squeezing and rubbing the nipples. As my hands slid down your body there was no need of my hands to caress your clit. I was not at all concerned about being too forward to excite a man whose experience before had been nothing like mine. I felt it was a good thing that you have gone through some heavy petting before our "first date".</p> <p>You were now leaning back against your chair just a bit and I could see that you had pushed your chair back toward me but you seemed not to have realized I was there. I could see that I had left a wet trail on the inside of your thighs, leaving no doubt that a man had pleased you. I had a raging hard-on as my hands caressed your breasts from behind as our kiss continued.</p> <p>I felt you shiver with excitement as I rubbed your mound through your panties a bit. Releasing your breasts from my hands I reached for my zipper and pulled your panties down. You had been rubbing my cock through my slacks, aching to have it inside of you, but you broke away from kissing me again just as I pulled your panties all the way down and my cock sprang free. "That's right guys", I said as I grabbed the sides. You smiled and pulled me into you before turning and pushing your face down between my legs. As I bent to suck on your breasts I noticed that this time you were not wearing panties.</p> <p>The warmth of your thighs against my face and your tongue lapping and gently sucking on my balls, while you played with my cock, only briefly bringing me to the point where I thought I might cum right there. You could feel the excitement building and as I stood up you began to unbutton your blouse. I pulled the blouse from you and you let it drop. I helped you unbutton them and began to rub your chest with the back of my arms. You were really looking sexy wearing this outfit, and it did not take long for my hands to make their way to your breast. I caressed and squeezed your breasts through the bra andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
