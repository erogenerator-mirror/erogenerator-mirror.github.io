I'll call the hotel and tell the kids I'm taking them home."</p> <p>"What kind of family would I have with you? I've never had a single family. You were only two kids?"</p> <p>"That's right. And they're my friends too, so yes, I'll have to call. I don't have a whole lot of friends. And, I'm pretty comfortable at home."</p> <p>"You know, Dad is still the same way, aren't you? You're still a good, smart son. You just need to learn to not let other people tell you what to do."</p> <p>The phone rang a few minutes later. "What are you up to, Mom?"</p> <p>"Just trying to do some cleaning. Is that okay? Can we order something to eat?"</p> <p>"Sure. Just bring the food and stuff up from the office."</p> <p>She got up, went to the office and brought the food up. "Thanks Mike. I'll see you later," she said to him.</p> <p>By the time she got back to her computer she was running up the website and looking up her own recipe. She didn't really need much of it, but it was just what she needed. 'Mike, where are you?'</p> <p>After some more work on the recipe she had a couple cups of coffee and went back to her office.</p> <p>"I've got some work for you to do."</p> <p>He got up from his usual spot on the couch and said, "I'm sure you have something else to do today."</p> <p>"No, what about you?"</p> <p>"Well, I'm sure you aren't going to be all morning, but you can come down for lunch. I have a lot of work for you, so let me get back to my work for you."</p> <p>"I'm glad we're getting around to talking. I really missed you tonight."</p> <p>"I missed you too, but you're such a good son."</p> <p>She was glad because for the next few minutes they just talked and laughed together. She got so excited she thought she would burst. He had really been good at cooking as well as being a good little son.</p> <p>"I love you Mom," he said after a bit of time.</p> <p>"Do you, Mike?" she said, taking him in her arms and kissing him. She felt as if he might take his eyes from her long enough to look at her. She had really missed his hugs and kisses at last.</p> <p>"I love you," he said.</p> <p>"You're still a good son, aren't you?"</p> <p>She was almost shaking with lust as he kissed her. "Yeah, but you haven't had sex with me yet," he said, and she just kept looking into his deep brown eyes so much like the sun in the sky.</p> <p>"I know, I've been so lonely all year. I couldn't do anything about it."</p> <p>She really meant it. "We've only got a few other days, and I think I really missed you all year. I just wanted to make sure you didn't just disappear."</p> <p>"Okay. Do me a favour?" he said.</p> <p>"Anything," she said.</p> <p>"Open a bottle of wine."</p> <p>"I'll do that you go ahead. Do you trust me enough with this stuff?"</p> <p>"I trust you more than anything."</p> <p>He got up and walked to the kitchen.</p> <p>She followed. He opened her wine. "I'm going to make us something a little more than a sandwich right now."</p> <p>"It's a nice little sandwich," she said, "would you like to try some other stuff?"</p> <p>"Sure." He got the sandwich and they ate. There wasn't anything fancy or anything like the food he usually ate, but he wasn't about to say no to anything that was made.</p> <p>They got up about half an hour later, and he came back with something else in his hands.</p> <p>"I figured you could have a few things made."</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>He carried out some of the different things she'd been talking about and they sat on the couch. His hands were wrapped around her neck, his fingers lightly teasing her skin.</p> <p>She pulled him down for a kiss, but he was teasing her back. "I'm leaving the rest of the things that have to do here," he said.</p> <p>"I can put the lunch away as well."</p> <p>"Okay," he said. "Can I make you a salad?"</p> <p>"Yeah, but if youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
