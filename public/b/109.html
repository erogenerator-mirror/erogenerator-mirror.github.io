I'm Amy, I'm a friend of friends."</p> <p>He looked at the two women, and said it, "I'm Dave."</p> <p>"Nice to meet you," Amy said, as she looked at the man.</p> <p>Dave said, "Nice to meet you too."</p> <p>Dave and Amy walked her to the elevator. They talked for a few minutes, and as the doors closed, Dave said, "This is an interesting relationship isn't it?"</p> <p>"You have no idea what I do," Amy answered.</p> <p>They rode in silence until the elevator arrived back at their floor. They entered his apartment and he said, "This is my best bed in the house. I have this amazing bedroom. You have a nice little apartment."</p> <p>"That's no problem," Amy said, smiling. She turned and kissed him. She held his large hand in both of hers and said, "I was in Chicago, meeting my boyfriend, when you got here! When you got here, I took my time and waited around before going out. We had a great time."</p> <p>"You look incredible," Dave said. He then looked over to the bed and said, "I think our relationship has reached new ground."</p> <p>"Yeah," Amy said, "I think you do...if you want to."</p> <p>"How?"</p> <p>"Let's see...get out of these clothes and get into bed together."</p> <p>"Okay babe." Amy replied.</p> <p>Dave was about to go for her when she said, "If this is what we can be."</p> <p>Dave turned and took her hand in his and said, "I want to be with you, Amy."</p> <p>She gave him a look that said, "Okay," and they started to go to bed.</p> <p>Amy took a deep breath as they walked into his room and said, "You know I have never had this much time alone with a man before, in all my years of being here. And I want to give you this. I want just about anything you could want."</p> <p>Dave looked at her while he was trying to calm down.</p> <p>Amy stopped and held his gaze while she said, "You have no idea."</p> <p>She then looked at the man and said, "That's right, you have no idea how much I really love you."</p> <p>Dave started to say something but thought better of it. He then smiled and responded, "I know. I just didn't expect this from you."</p> <p>She then went on, "I don't really want to be anyone's boyfriend. But there is something I want to be with you anyway, if that makes any sense."</p> <p>Amy then kissed Dave, and said, "I feel the same way about you and I, but I just thought that this might be a better way to spend your time."</p> <p>Dave sat up and looked at her and said, "I don't know. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do with all this time left."</p> <p>Amy then looked serious, and said, "I think that this is a good time. Besides, it would give me time to get ready."</p> <p>Dave looked down at her then said, "I didn't mean to imply that...that you would go to bed alone with someone else."</p> <p>Amy then said, "Just don't go with all that 'us' thing again."</p> <p>Dave looked into her eyes and said, "Okay."</p> <p>She then kissed him, again, and said, "Thank you."</p> <p>The two got out of their suits and headed for the shower. They spent the next several minutes in the shower, kissing and playing with each other's bodies. Dave loved watching her breasts moving as they got wet. She was soaping him up and was soaping him down when he asked her, "So, what do you think?"</p> <p>Amy replied, "The two of you were really fun and you were in the way. And, I hope we can do this again and again." Then she started to rinse off.</p> <p>They got out of their shower and quickly dried each other off and dressed for dinner. After dinner, Amy and Dave had dinner in his bedroom. When they got ready to leave, they looked at each other and just knew that they liked each other. They walked back out into the living room and Dave put his arm around Amy when she asked him if he would like to go for a walk.</p> <p>"Sure, let's go," Amy answered.</p> <p>They drove out to the lake and Amy said, "This is so beautiful, so quiet, and so beautiful."</p> <p>"I didn't want to get your head in the clouds again."</p> <p>"It was okay because I think I couldâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
