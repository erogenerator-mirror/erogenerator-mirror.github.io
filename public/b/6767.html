I asked, as we were still embracing each other.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"So we just go sit down, get comfortable and have a drink?"</p> <p>"I'd love that." I was thinking that we had been sitting in a car all this time and no one ever showed before about a drink. I'd never seen one before but right now something was different I thought. But there was something about the way her body felt, so sensual and comfortable, so feminine. I couldn't describe it. It was all so new.</p> <p>"Let me know when," she said as she kissed me gently. "After the party I don't think I'll be able to sit still." I reached out and rested my finger against her breast, feeling its smoothness. "I've never felt anything like it before," she added to say.</p> <p>We went back inside and she led the way to my bedroom and we sat on the edge of the bed. For a moment I was wondering what to say. The next thing I knew they went down on me again. Her mouth on my clit and another inside my pussy. It was all I could do to keep from screaming out her name. It was wonderful.</p> <p>They started undressing me. They were kissing now, tasting each other. I was holding each of them up to show that my hand was still stroking, even though it was not working. They were both naked. Neither one of them could even have come up with a good plan of being with them. What they did next was so erotic it had me screaming, just from their touch.</p> <p>But it wasn't the same way. It wasn't just the feeling of her warmth. There was a feeling as if my clit and pussy had been touched for hours. It wasn't just the two of them. Then they were playing with me, both of them taking turns licking and slurping me up and down between my legs. Then, as I just lay there with my head up in the clouds it finally happened. I came. In a sort of ragged noise that I never expected, it came from the way the two girls sucked and kissed all over.</p> <p>They both lay down next to me and they continued kissing me and holding me. But then one of them said to me, "So that's what you do," and they sat up between my legs. She pushed in as far as she could go.</p> <p>"Oh my God!" she said. "He's good! And he was good too! He was good!" I heard her saying what I thought I'd heard. But then I felt her moving up and down and a little harder with those tiny thrusts and then her hot wet pussy against my clit. I started to come again.</p> <p>They moved from over me to pull out and start to lick me up and down again. They kissed me and they licked each other up again. One of them put her right leg over my head and the other one sat on my face as I licked her and sucked her. One of them licked my pussy and I loved it. I loved every minute of it!</p> <p>Then they got up and came back and lay around me, each of them kissing me all over. I could feel their hands all over me. They caressed me and squeezed me and pressed me against them to feel their hands. I had no idea of what it was that I wanted from my lovers but it didn't matter to me. All that mattered was all that went with it. I could feel them moving over me and between my legs. One of them was on top of me as the other had to hold me down on it, keeping me on the bed in the position I thought I should stay in. That one of them was riding me on top. It was so erotic, so sensual, so feminine. I was just watching them, being watched. I watched myself being fucked, feeling the pressure of them on me, being the toy they wanted me to be. I watched myself being used and being dominated by them.</p> <p>Then one of them was lying down, putting a pillow under my head for support. I could feel them kissing me again until that first one pulled me up into the air like a dog. With my legs still over their shoulders my pussy was going into the air and then they were back into me. I felt like an animal as they took me again and again. One of them had a pillow under my neck and the other was on my breasts. I could feel them all over my body. Then it was time for another. They were laying there, facing each other. That had to be her. That was how it felt when I watched them in the mirror each time. Those moments of my life when I would see her body for the first time in a new way. That was the moment I felt truly connected to themâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
