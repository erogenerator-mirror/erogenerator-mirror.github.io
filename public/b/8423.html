My own alcohol intake was starting to kick in, but I tried harder to keep my composure.</p> <p>"Can I get a glass of water... please...?" Her voice was almost pleading now. I could feel an ache in my crotch, despite my best efforts to keep it down. It was not going to be so easy, I thought.</p> <p>After handing her the glass of water, she turned and bent over to pick it up. She wore a very sexy lingerie set with little or no frills. She slid those panties off her hips and put them neatly on top of her wet panties. She gave me a seductive smile.</p> <p>"I don't think I have any water, and I've got my back to the door, I'll have to get back to the others."</p> <p>"Ok." I replied, giving her a quick kiss on the cheek, I turned to walk back the cabin and turned on the deck. As I walked by the other people back to the deck, my mind kept going back to the last girl that I was sure I was going to get to fuck. Now was not the time to think like that, it would have been hard enough to do that. Besides, I wanted to get some sleep, or at least some rest.</p> <p>As I came back to the deck, I noticed all of the men and women sitting around, smoking, drinking wine and sitting around, drinking their beers and watching TV with their friends. I decided to get a chance to talk to them before I went to sleep, I would take a chance on what was on the TV, and I could make my way back to my cabin as quietly as I could. I sat down on the railing at one end of the deck and sat and started to watch the other side of the deck. When I noticed the girl sitting in a group sitting alone in the seat next to me, I got up and walked over to her.</p> <p>"May I sit with you?" I asked the girl. Her voice was a little husky, her body was covered in thick hair, her breasts were big and I could tell she was wearing a bra.</p> <p>"Um, yeah, sure." I followed her into the cabin. Her body was lithe and her breasts weren't at all what I expected. They were not as big as the ones I had seen the girls in the bathroom the other night but they were definitely larger and definitely not saggy. But the whole look on her face was... slutty. Not exactly a slutty look, but slutty, so I quickly tried to imagine her giving me a blow job in the heat of passion.</p> <p>She sat down next to me. She didn't seem to be drunk, I could certainly tell that. She leaned in to me on the couch and put her arms around my neck, pulling me in close to her. She pressed her lips against my ear, and whispered,</p> <p>"I have a date with you tonight, I'll do whatever you want until you say yes. I'm not going to let anyone else fuck me." Before I could even react, she pulled away and smiled at me,</p> <p>"I know! And I understand guys, I can get fucked anytime!" She said with a sly smile.</p> <p>I thought for a minute, and saw how she was looking at me. Her smile was like an old friend's.</p> <p>"So, what are the plans for tonight?" I asked her.</p> <p>"Um, I had to go to the bathroom," she said, but didn't have to explain, the way she looked at me that was a little bit too close to me. I figured I had better start without her at the door, or she would think that I was drunk. "I have my things here, I'll get some ice and go get some water. Don't worry, I haven't had a drink in a long time..." Her eyes met with mine for a few seconds. Then she looked away as if she was embarrassed. "I don't even remember the name of the bar, either. Now if you want to, that is." She smiled and put her head back.</p> <p>She took the glass of water from my hand, downed the glass, held it out to me and then let out a slight groan when she felt the coldness.</p> <p>"Ok, I'll be there in a little bit." She laughed a little while she drank the water. Then, I felt her hand caressing my arm,</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I was just... nervous being alone with you like that."</p> <p>"It's ok, I didn't realize it was going to happen like that." I had a feeling that her reaction to being alone with me was pretty quick.</p> <p>"You're not drunk, but youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
