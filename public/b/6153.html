I got on my knees as her head was right near my crotch. I was sitting in front of her between her legs and I couldn't see what she was gorging on. I grabbed her hips and pulled her toward me and she put her head up. Her pussy was still wet from what had been happening between her legs and I slid my fingers in her as I slowly rubbed the head of my cock along her slit. She reached around and grabbed at the base of my cock with her hand. With her other hand she reached back and grabbed my balls. I couldn't hold back any longer. It was the biggest I had ever been in and I exploded, but my cum wasn't as much as it was a little dribble, not really filling her as it leaked. She took it and brought it into her mouth and swallowed the cum that had spilled down her chin. I don't know if we had any last words, but my mind was racing. I was thinking of all the things I had done to her over the last three months. That was when she finally lifted her head off my cock, pulled her hand back and reached into her dress.</p> <p>She pulled the front of her dress from her body and said, "We have a big day ahead of us." With that she turned to face me and I got a look at her pussy. It looked so good with my cum on it.</p> <p>She reached over her left shoulder and lifted her dress up and threw it across the room. Then she reached behind her and pulled down her panties. She turned to me and said to me, "I know we haven't had the chance to do this." It sounded like she was talking to me, but I didn't care. I knew she had a surprise on her face, so I went back into her and started to kiss her. She held my head, her hand running up and down my back. For a moment we just looked down at each other. We looked into each other's eyes. She smiled and kissed me again.</p> <p>She looked down and said, "I know I wasn't supposed to do this and I don't want to ruin your surprise, but I kind of want to do it, too. That's why we haven't had time to do this."</p> <p>"I know what you mean," I said. I kissed her again, "No, no wait, this was something I wanted to do before I even met you." As I got up and moved to the bed, she lay on her back. I moved on top of her and she reached down and pushed my shorts down enough to free my cock. I took her hand and she held my cock as I slid down until my pubes lined up with her pussy and I just leaned up and kissed her. As her hand went back to my cock, I put my hands on either side of her face and lowered myself to her. We kissed. I could still feel the hot wetness of her pussy on my cock. She reached around and got her skirt and pulled it up. I helped her pull it over her head and put it to the side on the bed. She had nice big tits that sagged a little lower than her hips. She lay back and I kissed her lips again as I lifted my body up until I was just above her. I had never been in that position before and I kissed her again. She raised her legs and put them around me, drawing me in. I put my hands on her body, but just brushed her nipples, which caused her to lean up and put her hands under me so she could put her arms around me, too. I lay like this and watched her, looking down at her face as she looked up at me. I looked down a bit at her pussy with each stroke of my cock, watching the juices that were pouring away from her and onto her legs. She looked up at me as I continued to kiss her, her tongue darting out and sliding across mine. Then she put both of her hands on my shoulders and pulled me down on top of her as she put both hands on my back and started to push my stomach down and down so I was lying on top of her. I didn't move. I just kept kissing her mouth as I reached between us with one hand to try to find her pussy. The next thrust brought my cock to ground against her clit and I knew I was right on the edge of cumming right then, but she still didn't get to cum, instead pushing me down a little and kissing me harder.</p> <p>By the third time, I got her to let me up and sat back up. I didn't even wait on her as I got my knees under me. I slowly lowered myself until my cock was just pressing against her pussy as it went in. She didn't say a word. She looked down at my cock as it moved back and forth in herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
