She sits on the table beside me. "I really don't feel like we have anyplace in the world to put it. And as long as we're safe I'll sleep as long as she wants." Her hand is on my stomach where she starts to rub. As she moves it down over my abs, and under my boxers she touches my cock. I can't believe how big it feels. She moves down a little further, and with one hand she cups my sack. "Ooh, it's hard, but no, it's still just small. What you got up there at?" She moves her hand around, around it, feels it all. "Hmmm, nice," she says. "It's really firm. I'm starting to think I'll need something smaller for now. I'll probably need to take care of this." She starts to slide her hand up and down like that a few times, and then back up. Then she sits so close to me. Her hair and makeup is streaked as she sits right next to me. I reach in my pants and pull out my cock. "Ooh, you like that, don't you? I guess I do," she says with a smile. Without waiting for me to acknowledge she leans in and starts to run her tongue up and down the length of my dick. I hold back, and let her stroke me to her own rhythm, and I feel her hand slide up to feel for myself. She looks up at me for a second before she starts working it with her mouth and tongue. "Mmm, yes," comes back. "You're so long. I'm gonna get my eyes good and wet." She grabs the base firmly. I hold out as long as I can, but she's got it all. Her tongue slides up and down my cock like a snake does, and her hand works it quickly from base to the head. When she reaches the tip, she pulls back with a pop, and I'm already halfway to erupt. My cock explodes. The first shots bounce off her chin and my chest, and the next one travels over her forehead. One shot goes across her nose, the rest lands on her face. The rest lands all over me with even more force.</p> <p>"Ooooh, thank you," she says, "that was great. I like the taste of cum."</p> <p>"Mmm, thank you too," I respond. She continues to stroke my cock with her hand as she slides her tongue on the underside of it. My legs are aching, so she starts to push me back towards her, and my dick slides between her legs so I'm in full contact with her still-throbbing vagina. She pushes down so that my tip penetrates her, and then she stops. "Mmm, no, not there. Hold on." She pushes me away completely (I'm surprised we make it in the first place, it seems like such a long time since we've done that).</p> <p>She slides off the edge, her face looking a little tired by now, but she manages to move herself away again. "Did I do something wrong?" I ask. She leans over my cock, and the first drops of cum splatters on my skin, and then drops on my chest. I'm starting to feel really bad that I let all those spurts go on me. I'm not so sure if she noticed, or if this is something we're doing now, but I doubt she did.</p> <p>"I'm sorry about that," she says, and just sits on the table now, my still-hard dick inches away from her cunt.</p> <p>"Did I do anything wrong?" she asks, her face all puffy and red.</p> <p>"Mmm, there was one thing," I say.</p> <p>"Hm? Anything?" she asks, her look almost childlike. She's still sitting on the edge of the table, holding herself there, as I watch. "What do you think?" I ask.</p> <p>"Well, that was way better than expected. I like it better that way. But I think it will feel a lot better if we're both still sticky enough, and you and I can just stay like this forever."</p> <p>"Is that really a bad Idea, you know, to be with me?" I ask. "We can go back to that mess like this after we get it off of us, all hot and heavy," she says, and she starts rubbing the cum on her pussy and stomach, "maybe I'm not much of a cook when we're together," she finishes in a whisper.</p> <p>"But I like to get clean after sex. It is a good way to get the sperm from my brain down the back of the toilet."
