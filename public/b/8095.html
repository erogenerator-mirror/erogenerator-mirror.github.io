His voice was teasing.</p> <p>She was feeling herself getting nervous. This wasn't the first time he'd made it known to her he wasn't her boyfriend, but he was her first boy. And now it all seemed so new. She took a deep breath, cleared her throat, and said aloud "Hi!".</p> <p>"Hey" he laughed. "Where you at?" he said as he leaned forward in his chair "I'm Mike" he continued with his conversation.</p> <p>"Right here in my kitchen." she answered.</p> <p>"Are you sure we're not doing a naughty little secret?" he asked as he leaned forward to kiss her, his lips brushing her lips quickly. She could feel the heat of his lips on hers, and it sent a shiver up her back and down her body, as she could feel an orgasm begin to build in her. He reached around her to untie the bikini top from behind. It fell to the floor, exposing her smooth naked body beneath. She didn't care. She was a naughty schoolgirl, all she had to do was ask.</p> <p>She reached down and took his hand guiding him to where she wanted. He started as she leaned forward, her hands resting on either side of his face. She felt his hands on her shoulders, and then move lower to grab her bottom, his hands sliding over her firm cheeks. She raised her lips up to him again, letting him run his tongue over her bottom lip as they met. She could feel her body responding to him. His hands began to trace their way down her back to her bottom, pulling her to him, pulling her into him. The feel of his hands on her bum sent another wave of need through her lower abdomen. She pulled herself closer to him, pushing her butt upwards. He leaned over, his hands now cupping her breasts, his tongue pushing into her mouth, his tongue swirling around hers. She started to kiss him harder, her lower lips finding his, and opened up to accept him.</p> <p>"Please" she heard herself say. "Take off your pants". He unzipped his pants and pulled them off, exposing his black bikini briefs. His cock was already hard and standing at full strength. She couldn't believe she said it to someone. She felt his hands come to her hips and then the inside of back of her thighs. He lifted her up and spun her around to look into her eyes.</p> <p>"Is your body ready for some more play?" he asked as he pushed her down onto the kitchen table. He had his hand up under her bikini bottom, caressing her bare bottom. She began rocking back and forth over his fingers, letting them slide up and down her wet pussy. His fingers slid in easily and slid the bikini out of time with them. Her eyes closed as his fingers slid inside her. She arched her hips up as he penetrated her deeper. Her clit began to swell, her pussy spasmed around his fingers as their tongues met again. He slipped his hands under her bikini bottom, his fingers sliding under the thin strap and over the bare skin above her clit, then pulling on the other strap. He lifted her up and slowly lowered her back down onto his rigid cock. She felt as his cock slipped between her thighs, slipping into the tight slit of her pussy as he slowly pulled her back towards the tip. She opened her eyes and looked into his and grinned.</p> <p>"Ready for some more action, Mike?" she said as she lifted off all fours, then straddled his lap. She grabbed his hands and put them on her breasts. "We've been so long without you touching me, this is amazing!" she said as she started bouncing up and down on his cock. His hands on her tits felt amazing. He couldn't believe they had gone from her breasts to her pussy but it was obvious they would be sore if she lost weight. The feeling of the soft flesh against his hands was unbelievable!</p> <p>"Faster". She encouraged him. "Fuck me". Mike slid two fingers down the crack of her ass, trying to find the opening of her pussy. He knew that she loved to talk dirty, knowing that other men could tell he found the dirty talk exciting. But this was only getting started, it was his turn to push, and soon! He looked at the table as he continued to slide his fingers in and out of her. There wasn't a whole lot of space on the floor on the table but it was enough to let him lay her on her back with the table behind him. His free hand grabbed the back of her thighs and pushed them up and down until he was sure both her legs were spread wide apart.</p> <p>"Come closer to me". she said as she pushed her knees back towards her shoulders making her pussy even easier to get in his hand.
