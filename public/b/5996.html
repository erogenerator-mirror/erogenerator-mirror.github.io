She would feel the need to please him, even to herself. She wanted to please him.</p> <p>There was more of an urgency than just the way she loved him.</p> <p>Her desire for him almost became a need.</p> <p>As they got to the house, and were able to enter the bathroom and get out of their clothes, she stripped and stood before him; her hands around his throbbing shaft. She wanted the feeling of him inside her, even though they had already fucked and then had that shower, and then done more than that.</p> <p>"Yes, baby yes. Oh god yes. Do it to me."</p> <p>And she did, feeling the warmth spread deep inside her belly and filling her. She felt the excitement in her breasts, feeling their weight in his gaze. The hardness between her legs, and the hardness that his fingers had pressed to her clit, when he had played with it.</p> <p>She reached out and felt for his hot manhood. She pulled it toward her, feeling it's weight, the warmth, the weight that would be deep inside her. She was ready. It was already buried deep inside her.</p> <p>"Don't stop. I want you now. Take me."</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>After he had dropped her off at the house, he had quickly climbed into bed and rolled over before she could get within reach of her pussy. He heard the soft squeak and he knew, once again, that she was in good shape for sleeping beauty. He was hard again immediately.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>She loved the way he had slid into her and she had known what he was going to do. He would be inside her, fucking her very hard, all with her mind in the pillow. And he would hear all the sounds she made, hear all the voices and their expressions. He would be in her so deep and deep inside her, feeling in her womb, being, and becoming that which he wanted inside her, the one, the one who deserved his touch.</p> <p>He would not hurt her. The thought was enticing for her.</p> <p>He would give her a little, a little, as he always did after a few minutes of a woman who would give him a little pleasure.</p> <p>But he would not push her, give her the pleasure, his pleasure, to be as complete as she could be. There was his very soul, his very being, the very essence of his being, the very essence of his woman. She would never know that she was in fact, the very essence of him.</p> <p>He heard her breathing, and he knew she was on the line, she was there, there for him no matter what.</p> <p>His mind and body were completely focused on her. In their connection, his mind and body were totally focused on her. And he knew that he had made a decision about what he wanted now, and that it would not necessarily be hard to make. They both had choices.</p> <p>He wanted that with her, and he wanted that with her now. Both, they both wanted, needed, wanted each other.</p> <p>This woman that he was now, had told him that he had his choice, that he was, for him, that he would love her. Now, he knew that the choice was hers alone. He, his whole world was now hers, to be taken.</p> <p>Now, he wanted to take her. This woman in his arms, this beautiful, loving creature, his woman. And he knew that there was no future in this. This woman, this beautiful creature would choose to marry him forever.</p> <p>His hand slid into her soft, and wet pussy. She moaned, and he knew she was on her way to her own orgasm. And now.</p> <p>She began to thrust herself into him. His cock, which as he had known, was long and thick, now pulsing madly. She pushed even harder now, moving in the soft wetness of the sheets, wanting it in her.</p> <p>Her movements got as much of a bit like those he always saw on the set of the 'Lady in red'. She would thrust up to him. She was moaning. The sound sent shivers though his body.</p> <p>She started to come, and he began to match her thrusts. As her motions became shorter, more frequent, her whole body went numb; and her knees began to tremble. As her orgasm began to grow even more, she felt a bit lightheaded insideâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
