"We've always wanted to come here. It's my first day."</p> <p>"Well don't just stand there and be polite. Go have a seat."</p> <p>She sat down, and I sat down as well, facing toward her. As she sat down I moved closer, so that I would always be directly behind her, so that her face was just inches from mine. We were very close, so that I could feel the warmth and softness of her hand on my arm, and the softness and comfort of her body. It was the most intimate gesture I had ever given myself, to be sure, but this time... this one moment I had been completely drawn in by this girl. It was not something I could describe for very much longer. In no way could I explain what had overtaken me.</p> <p>She smiled a kind of happy smile, and I could see that she was getting rather excited, so I reached my hand out to her. She accepted, and as we embraced I felt that wonderful contact between our bodies, and her arms went around my neck, pulling me toward her, and then pulling me closer once more. There was a slight tension in the air, so I broke the contact with our kiss, and moved my mouth from hers.</p> <p>As the kiss ended, and I stood up, she turned to face me, and kissed me for several minutes. She broke the kiss for a moment, and looked at me as she spoke to me. It wasn't something I had done before, but it was certainly an eye-opening experience for her. She was genuinely interested in what I was asking her to do, and she had no idea of what was really required in being a domme, or submissive.</p> <p>"I think we are about to have sex."</p> <p>"Yes," she said with a warm smile. "I like that. Does that mean what I think it does, and what it means to you? And may I ask what it means? Do you think this is the way to experience the feeling you were looking for?"</p> <p>"Oh yes, yes." I said emphatically. We sat there in each other's arms, watching the evening play out unfold before us, and it was absolutely beautiful. We kissed and hugged and giggled away together, and I could see that she was growing increasingly aroused, to the point where she was almost in a fever, and that her breathing was coming in short gasps now. I was almost shaking with the effort of holding off from reaching down and touching her, when in a moment of inspiration, rather than any plan, I decided to be quite and fully dominant. This meant a change in her, but I wanted to do it slowly. I wanted to teach her a certain lesson that night, and not for that, as in any given situation, I wanted to push it up a notch, something that I had never done before. I wanted a woman of my own age, who could just enjoy a bit of the "fun" of having a Domme live out her life. The only real problem now... that would be if I really took the edge off... but that would also mean that she was too old, for a domme, to do what I wanted to. I liked that and knew it, but I didn't want to make her feel like that. I was a little bit of a challenge here. I wanted to show her the error of her ways, and what she had just done for herself, but also wanted to keep her aroused and wanting to explore new thoughts, ideas and experiences. I was also, in order to do that, have her give herself to me as freely and fully as she had ever been to another woman. I was a bit of a sucker, but I knew that if I could get her to admit that she was attracted to me I could very well turn some of that into something I could actually do. I also knew that if I could make her start enjoying herself sexually, then she might not be as confused the rest of the evening as I had been preparing for her, and could probably live with the fact that I had turned her down, and was now the one trying to make her "yes" my submissive, even if it meant that I had to keep her as my own, and not only in the way she was looking at me. I leaned down and kissed her tenderly, but firmly, and she responded with a tender smile of pleasure.</p> <p>"That feels so very nice, Miss Sable," I said. "Do you like to make love, Miss Sable?"</p> <p>"My dear, yes, but there will always be times when I think of you."</p> <p>"Yes, you will. Now go."</p> <p>"Yes Miss Sable. I shall." I walked behind her in the chair, so that I could sit down upon herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
