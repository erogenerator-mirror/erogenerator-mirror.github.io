"God, me too," she moans, "oh god," she finally says through a prolonged kiss that almost gives me pain, "please... fuck me... I want your cock in me!... please, I need it... please!" she whispers, her legs trembling from her orgasm. "Please!... please!... fuck, yesssssss... fuck me... please!!!!"</p> <p>I stand there for a moment, not sure if she is ready, waiting, not sure. I pull her to the kitchen and stand her in front of us and gently but firmly, I ease my cock between her breasts and with a couple of quick strokes, I am in her breasts, I feel her nipples dig into me as she starts to tremble, I hear her grunt as my cock begins to enter her.</p> <p>I look down to see her face. It is filled with tears, but not from pain, she is simply overwhelmed with emotion. Her face is turned away, she is looking at the floor, looking up at me with eyes filled with love and desire. I reach up with my free hand and grab her chin and bring her face to mine and kiss her lips. She opens her mouth to accept my tongue, and our tongues meet and dance and dance together. I hold her close and she pulls me hard against her and slowly starts to grind her body against mine. Her nipples are so hard, I feel them almost touching my chest. I don't care at this moment if anyone outside is nearby.</p> <p>I feel her body moving, feeling her body as if in an erotic dance, her hips pumping her hips up and down in time with mine. She is totally into me, she is totally into me. It was only a second but I know the feeling. I reach down and run my hands along her face and cheekbones.</p> <p>I feel her move, her hips working on mine as I kiss her neck, gently licking her ear lobe. I feel her body begin to shake, I feel her legs tense and tremble, and begin to tremble even more. I look into her eyes and tell her.</p> <p>"I'm cumming again."</p> <p>Her voice and words echo in my ears as another orgasm explodes within her. Her body convulses on mine, and she digs her nails into my arms and pulls me against her, hard! "Aaaaahh!" she squeals as I feel her muscles contract and pulse around me, and I begin to shoot cum into her as her orgasm begins. Her nails dig into my back as she comes around me, holding my ass and hips as tightly as she can.</p> <p>I can feel my cock beginning to soften inside her, and my cock begins to shrink, the muscles and tendons, all taught and taut and sore. I feel the tightness of her pussy as it clenches my cock, and I let go of her hips and sit down on her. She feels the wetness of our mixed fluids on her hand and brings it to her mouth as she moves her body to face me.</p> <p>"Mmm... you taste so good!" she whispers as she kisses my lips... and we kiss againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
