It was about 3:30 a.m., and we decided to spend the entire night in the motel. I think it was about $60 bucks a night. We decided that sleeping without the bathroom was going to be easier, and the best part was when we got into bed, and it was still dark. We could both see that he was fully hard. We both liked it that way. He slipped his arm around me and brought me to him... he was half asleep. I fell asleep with him. One second he was holding me, the next I was in his arms. His arm wrapped across me, the back of his hand caressing my back. I knew that I didn't want it to end, but his hand didn't move. It was so much more than what a man would probably understand. We were both naked with him snuggled up against me as if we were a normal lovers. I never thought of myself as sexy or sexy, but I wasn't ashamed to be able to feel this in him. I could feel his erection. I was surprised at what he and I were doing. It wasn't anything to get jealous over, he just wanted to make our night more amazing. He kissed me, then started to nibble my neck where I usually like that. His teeth lightly scraped mine, then moved to my breast.</p> <p>I could feel the blood in his ears, his erection, hard as a rock. He slowly pulled back from me, looked me in the eye, and gently kissed every inch of my face, chest, neck, breasts, stomach, as he went. I could still feel it. It could also have been his hand. I didn't feel it moving, but just... there, on the part of me that he knew was there. I opened my eyes again to gaze into his. His face was that of a predator looking for prey. I found him hard, the tip of it peeking out from its hood, and it did not seem like we were alone in bed, or even just the two of us. He had a predatory smile on his face. Then, as gently as possible, he placed the tip of his organ on the end of my hip and very slowly, oh so slowly, began to make the motion of pulling out of me.</p> <p>His eyes never left mine. They were soft and deep. I wondered if he even knew that he was making me feel like that, that he was looking at me in such a way as to be staring into my soul.</p> <p>His cock was rock hard, as hard as it was the day before, and it was all mine. It was all mine.</p> <p>After a bit of time, he started to slowly move his fingers through my pubic hair to find his way to the lips of my vagina, his cock now fully inside me. If I could have told you, it would have been at that point, in only the very first motion. But, I didn't know. Instead, I had a feeling that just as quickly as it happened, his hips began pressing down and I knew it was time for me to take over. I was there. I knew. I told you what happened the first time your husband went into your pussy so that is why it took over a quarter of an hour. But, I never got what he was doing with his mouth. He never used a condom for me. He was using you. He had been sucking on my clit the whole time. He had a condom on. The feeling of him pumping you into me was so intense. You were mine. You are my husband now. For the time being, I just wanted that feeling of being completely owned, by him, by myself, by the two of us and all of this, everything.</p> <p>"God," it just came out as a soft mumble, "Oh my." It was the most that I could come up with. He held me more firmly, and then slowly, very gently, brought me back down to rest back on his dick. I could feel every little part of him, every bump of the head.</p> <p>I was sitting there in his lap as he started moving inside me. He made love in a way that I have never felt. So gently and so loving. Our bodies, bodies that were meant to belong to each other. He started moving inside me again, and was so gentle that I wasn't being taken, I'm not sure that word, "screwing" or moving at all, but I remember, not long after, the "fucks slow and fast" as he called it.</p> <p>After about a minute, he said, "Your husband is my slut." Well, a few minutes later, we came together.
