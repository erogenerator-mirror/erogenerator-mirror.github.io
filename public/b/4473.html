It was like we both seemed to take an entirely new direction, and then stop thinking about where there had been before. We just kept smiling at each other.</p> <p>I sat at the table, and we finished off all the champagne. It was a really nice and relaxing time. We were enjoying talking, and a lot of the girls were talking to us as well. We told jokes and had a lot of laughs. We finished the evening, and she seemed happy to talk about our work, as did I. We finished the champagne, and she said "Well goodnight," and went to our table.</p> <p>She got up, took our hands, and walked with us to our room. We sat on the bed, and began to kiss. She undid my pants and freed my cock and balls. I let her do her best; she had all she had. After a few minutes of kissing, fingering and playing with each other, I turned on her again, and she lay on her back and I entered her.</p> <p>I felt her pussy tighten up around me. "Oh, Tommy," she said. "I'm cumming."</p> <p>"Yes," I said, and started to buck in her.</p> <p>"I love it when you do that," she said, and grabbed my shoulders so she wouldn't topple, and I felt her body clench around me.</p> <p>"Do you like that?" I asked, kissing the side of her neck.</p> <p>"You know I do, Tommy," she said, and leaned back on her elbows.</p> <p>And we did. I felt her body convulse when I came in her, and when we were finished, we rolled back to the middle of the bed. I wanted to give her a real good time, so I put the key she gave to the house keys in my pocket, so I could drive her to the door, and drive her home. We fell asleep.</p> <p>We got up early and went into the city early the next morning. She woke me up by kissing me. We walked to the subway and hailed a cab for an early morning stop at the courthouse. She gave me a big hug and kiss, and we walked towards her waiting room. We got into the cab and she got in behind me. I reached over her body and grabbed a breast in each hand and kissed them. She responded and ran her fingers through my chest hair. I kept on kissing her neck until we reached the courthouse.</p> <p>Inside, she sat next to me, and I pulled her around so she could hold her. We kissed again, and my hand slowly ran up and down her stomach. When the cab stopped, she kissed me back, and I got up. We walked out the front door and into her house, and we walked up to the front door. She stood close to me as we kissed, not saying a word.</p> <p>We got inside after a minute, and locked the door. She led me by my cock to the bedroom. She took off her clothes and lay on her back, and I kneeled between her legs, facing her. She pulled me down and we kissed a good long time. I went around kissing her body with kisses and tonguing every bit of skin I could. She took me into her mouth before I could do anything. Her tongue played with and around the head as I sucked and licked her clit. She moaned and arched when I felt her body pulse. She grabbed her tits and pulled them tight as I came over her face. I was in heaven as I sucked her clit and ate up her honey. When I could breathe properly again, I stood and she stood, and we walked back to the front door.</p> <p>We kissed and held hands for several minutes before going to her apartment. We walked upstairs and into her bedroom, and then we went upstairs to bed, and laid there in each other's arms, kissing slowly at first. I felt warm and happy inside. I felt good, so happy, and yet, so out of control. We fell asleep with me holding her, and that just felt so right. Tomorrow, when she woke me up at the office, I walked up to her. I kissed her on the lips, and she said "Good morning, dear."</p> <p>We kissed for a moment, again, and then went to bed. We got into bed, and held each other, naked in the darkness again.</p> <p>We woke up early the next morning, and made love before we got up. She wore one of her nightgowns, and had her robe closed. I got a towel, and we put it on top of the bed. I put the other one on top of her gown and we took the bedspread so weâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
