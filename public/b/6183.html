Her hips started to rock and buck with the beginnings of an orgasm built. She bit her finger in to hold back and it only resulted in the pain of her lips leaving a gaping wet sheathe.</p> <p>"Ohmygod! That was amazing!" she gasped in to the darkness.</p> <p>"It was. Just perfect," Josh said. He bent down and sucked her breasts into his warm, wet mouth.</p> <p>Sonia came back to reality. She lifted herself up and grabbed Josh by the shoulders. "No! I can't do this! Stop right now, I don't want him to think I want him!" she squealed and broke eye contact once again.</p> <p>Josh pulled away from Sonia's breast and she fell against him, shivering and trying to catch her breath. "There, there," she sighed. She kissed him on the lips. "Are you okay?"</p> <p>"Of course, I'm sorry," he smiled.</p> <p>"That wasn't nice!" she said. She stood up. "I'm going to get undressed, will you sit with me?"</p> <p>"Sure," he said, nodding and grabbing a blanket and blanket to cover himself. He sat down on the arm of the couch and stared intently at his beautiful lover. She sat down on him, staring into his eyes with her mouth, licking her lips.</p> <p>"Are you sure you trust me?" she asked.</p> <p>"Always," he said.</p> <p>"Good," she smiled. "Because I have to get ready for my date tonight, right?"</p> <p></p> <p>It was two hours later, the week after Sonia had her first orgasm over Josh. They had been watching a movie together every Saturday night. Josh had his hands all over Sonia's body, sucking her nipples while she kept on rubbing Josh. He kissed her lips and then pulled away from her long enough to look at her.</p> <p>"What do you say I show you how much I love you, Sonia?" he said.</p> <p>"Okay." She grabbed Josh's hand and pulled it up to her chest. He felt her large breasts and her hard nipples. Josh could see the dark circles on her boobs.</p> <p>"You know," Sonia said after she had taken his right hand and put it on her left breast. "I was right, you do know that I love you."</p> <p>"You do love me, too." He began to fondle her. He moved his hand up and down from her breast up until he reached her nipples again. Sonia moaned. "Mhmm," she said. Josh massaged her left breast, and started to suck the other one. They stayed this way for a long period, kissing, sucking, nibbling, grabbing, kissing. Then she looked at him.</p> <p>"What are you waiting for?" she asked.</p> <p>"Let me do that," he said. He moved closer and she took his semi-hard cock into her mouth. The combination of her saliva, Josh's pre-cum, and his pre-cum made his cock feel so good. Josh could feel the soft silk of her lips on his head. The muscles under his head tensed and she sucked harder and deeper. Josh couldn't hold back any longer, his hips started a jerking and Sonia grabbed onto his back and pulled him closer. "God, I'm going to cum," he said as he came in her mouth.</p> <p>"Me too," Sonia giggled.</p> <p>"God, I'm so goooood," he groaned.</p> <p>Sonia looked at him. "That was wonderful," she said with obvious emotion.</p> <p>"Really? I told you that you were the most wonderful lover I've ever had," he said.</p> <p>"That's all because of you then. You were the love of my life; I would do anything to make you happy," she said.</p> <p>Josh smiled and grabbed her by the waist to sit on the couch next to her. He kissed her gently.</p> <p>"We still have the whole evening ahead of us. I can't wait to see what else you've got planned for us," he said.</p> <p>"I am going to surprise you," she said with a smile. "Promise me you won't ever forget what I had that you gave me with those panties of yours!"</p> <p>Before Josh could reply, she grabbed his hand and pulled him up to straddle her face. She then guided his cock into her mouth. She started to lick and suck his shaft up and down while kissing. She would move slowly on his cock, moving her tongue and sucking and kissing it. She could feel his hard, fat cock inside her mouth and was glad that she didn't have to use her hands. He moaned softly as he felt her wet mouth, but it also felt wonderful to feel and taste his cockâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
