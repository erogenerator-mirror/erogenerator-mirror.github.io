I said after another deep lick. "I love you and I love you."</p> <p>The next afternoon after work I came home early from work. I was nervous, excited, horny as hell. I walked into the house expecting to find Emily sitting on the couch but no one was in the living room.</p> <p>I walked up to her and said, "Emily, I am home."</p> <p>"Honey. Is Chris here? Do you want me to go out?" she asked. "He's in the shower, he's waiting for me," she said.</p> <p>"Are you coming?" I asked.</p> <p>"Chris is here...?" she said quickly.</p> <p>"Yes, he's waiting for you."</p> <p>"He's just in the shower!" she said.</p> <p>"Don't try to fix your hair, honey, he's right there for you."</p> <p>"Come over, sit down, you're not done." I said.</p> <p>She sat down on the loveseat and spread her legs. There was a lot of moisture to see. Her pussy was swollen, wet, open and inviting. I pulled her skirt up so we could see more.</p> <p>"Go ahead," she said after I was in her.</p> <p>This time I moved in with my full length and she grabbed my erection. I went to pull away but she held me firmly.</p> <p>"Come with me," she said. "Chris' waiting. I want to watch you fuck."</p> <p>I wasn't sure if she would take me up on my offer or not but the thought of seeing this big hard cock, all swollen and red, sliding in and out of her vagina was something I was not going to pass up. As I got closer to cumming I heard her say, "Hurry."</p> <p>I started to work the head of my cock in and out of her pussy. It was easy because she was so wet. I was almost ready to explode. She said, "Take your time so you don't make a mess on the couch."</p> <p>I was really surprised, but I just pushed forward, burying my cock all the way in her belly. She started to move, pushing back on me until I was almost all the way out. She stopped and said, "Slowly baby."</p> <p>I felt her stomach flutter with every stroke I made. The feeling of my hard cock buried to the balls in her pussy was driving me nuts.</p> <p>She had her hand on the back of my neck pulling on my hair. My lips were on her neck and she had her back arched to me. She was rocking back and forth, pushing her pussy around my cock. Suddenly she grabbed my cock and started stroking me.</p> <p>"Oh God, I'm cumming," she screamed.</p> <p>I thought she was going to say it again but in her ecstasy she said it again. "Oh baby, I'm cumming, oh God," she screamed as her body tensed and shuddered against me.</p> <p>She pulled my face to her neck; my cum was hot and thick in her belly. We stayed coupled as her body continued to quiver. She kissed my forehead and my chest. I finally pulled out of her.</p> <p>"I'll be right back baby," I said. Then I ran into the bathroom. Emily called a little after I got there. I stopped and asked if she was okay.</p> <p>"Are you kidding? Are you kidding? We can't be having second thoughts after all this just yet." She said.</p> <p>"Me either. I'd like to come over right about now if it's okayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
