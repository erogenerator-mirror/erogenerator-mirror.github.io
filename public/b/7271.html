I decided not to go, for I knew there was a good chance that she would be the one doing the making.</p> <p>I took our clothes off and tossed them all into the hamper, and then I closed the door, and I could hear her rustling around in her closet. "Where were you for a minute?" I said to myself and then I heard her rustling around some more. Finally, I went into the spare toilet and sat down on the bed. I waited several minutes, then I heard the sound of an object or something being unzipped. I got up from the bed and walked over to the bathroom door just in case. I peered in and she stood there with what must have been a vibrator in her hand. I waited a few minutes and she walked into the bathroom. I closed the door.</p> <p>I heard her walk across the room and sit down on the toilet. Her legs are long and thin, but still well toned and she had a smooth smooth flat stomach. Her ass was nicely rounded, and the crack of her ass was round and nicely formed. The smell coming out of her hung heavy on me; I couldn't keep my eyes from the puddle forming under her. I could feel my cock start to swell; she caught me before I could cum!</p> <p>"What's up?" I said, trying to hide a grin.</p> <p>"I thought it was you I wanted to talk to today," she said.</p> <p>"I wanted to talk about your divorce. You broke the news to me, and I wanted to say good ole, you're a great guy," I said as I took in her body for the first time.</p> <p>"I need to get a job, and I am glad it came to this," she said.</p> <p>"My wife is in another state today," I said, my heart pounding in my chest.</p> <p>"Me too, is she seeing anyone?" I wanted to know.</p> <p>"No, there's no one."</p> <p>"So is she seeing anyone or was you getting married or something," I probed.</p> <p>"It has to do with what happened the last night that you took that picture of me. I want to talk to her about it."</p> <p>"Well, can you please stay here tonight and talk, or will you give me a ride home," she asked, looking at me with a look that I didn’t think she could manage.</p> <p>"I’ll give you a ride if you want to go ahead," I offered.</p> <p>"You don't even have to drive, if you want to. My roommate does too. She's staying tonight with her parents," she smiled.</p> <p>"Is that a deal?" I wondered just how I could stay.</p> <p>"Don't you worry, I’ll take care of it for you if you want, and I know just what to do," she said as she turned and walked to the door.</p> <p>I stood up and closed the bedroom door. I sat on the edge of the bed and wondered if I should go talk to her, or should I keep my mouth shut and put it to bed. I shook my head and decided I didn't want to listen to the rest of her story. I opened the door and walked down the hallway, closing the door, and then I walked to the living room and stood in the doorway of the kitchen.</p> <p>The living room was a great room, a perfect contrast to the bedroom, and the whole place was tastefully decorated with a light gray color. Just above the kitchen sink I could see her standing in the doorway. She looked great in a sheer robe that barely covered her. She was wearing her hair back in a style that I had never seen a woman wear. Her hair was long and blond and her skin was fair. She was smiling.</p> <p>"I’m glad you called me, it got me talking," she said. "Why don't you come in and have a seat at the table."</p> <p>I took my seat at the end of the table. She sat down at her kitchen bench and smiled at me. The only other thing she wore was the flimsy robe.</p> <p>"What can I get you to drink?" she asked.</p> <p>"How about I pour you a glass of the best wine you have right now?"</p> <p>"Oh," she said, "It's just about water," she pointed at her glass.</p> <p>She started—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
