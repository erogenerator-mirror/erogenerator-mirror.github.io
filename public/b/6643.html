He slid into her, and I felt his balls against my clit as he began to fuck her and hold my hips tight to him. My back arched as my orgasm built, and soon I was pounding her pussy in an effort to push him deeper. She threw her head back, and her body convulsed with another orgasm. She held him tight against her, and he held her hips, driving himself in and out of her until suddenly I felt him stiffen and his cock swell up and throb as he unleashed his cum into her pussy. My own orgasm was still flowing, and I felt him begin to slide out of her, and saw her turn to him, legs spreading as her mouth engulfed him again. I felt myself losing control again, and pulled his cock from her mouth with a small pop and looked up at him questioningly. He kissed her, and she kissed him back. He pulled off her body and slid her to the ground, and then turned her to his own body beside hers and began to kiss her again, this time taking his time kissing her neck and chest as he was fucking her. She leaned back against him, and I saw his hard cock begin to slide further into her. He held his position for just a moment, then pulled out and she guided his cock back into my wife, who took the cue. She fucked him as he fucked her. He fucked her as she came, and she came again, squeezing his cock with her pussy. They stopped again, and they both came down from their climax.</p> <p>After a moment, they turned to me and smiled. We began to kiss again, and then they turned around and started to kiss again. I slid myself down to kneel between them and began to kiss and lick them, then felt her hand reach under my body and she took my cock in her hand and began to stroke me. She rolled it over, rubbing the head around her pussy until it was dripping with her juices. I could hardly stand it, but I quickly stood up and stepped up to her. I looked at her, and she smiled and lowered herself once more, opening herself to me until she was ready. I slid in gently, feeling the soft lips of her pussy as she lowered herself on my dick, then slid back quickly, feeling the warm, wet flesh envelope mine. She began to bounce slightly back and forth, riding my cock slowly as if enjoying this all the more for her own enjoyment. I began to slide my hands up to her breasts, and ran my fingers up and down her nipples. When I felt her legs tighten and slide my hands out of her ass, I slid right back up to where we both were. We began to fuck again, holding each other in the saddle as each new penetration caused us to moan softly.</p> <p>A few moments later, I felt her push back down against me as she came again, and I felt myself begin to fill her with my cum. She felt me fill her and begin thrusting back against her. We stopped moving only long enough to take all my weight back into her arms. The look on her face told me we had both been well and truly fulfilled for the day. My dick slipped out again, and we both lay back to hold onto each other.</p> <p>He lay next to her and began to stroke her again, and I noticed that she put her hand on his dick as he touched her.</p> <p>After a moment, he leaned over and kissed her, then whispered something in her ear and she pulled him closer as she turned me on to sleep next to her. His hand continued to play with her nipples as we snuggled. I woke up some time later, and felt the stirring rise between my legs. When my eyes opened, he was awake and smiled at my erection. I smiled back, and he lay back and looked at me, then reached his hand out to me. It was as if he were afraid to touch me, but he kissed me first, then kissed down my chest, leaving a trail of kisses down my stomach and along where my cock was. He leaned down and began to lick me off, and I could feel myself begin to twitch as he lightly sucked on my balls. When the feeling returned, he slid his hand up my shaft, then took me again into his mouth. I felt his lips around the head of my cock on my down stroke, and he held it there to gently suck on it, then slid it back up to the tip to slide my own in his mouth. I could feel myself becoming hard again, and he slid his lips along it more. Again it began to move forward, then back again until I felt his tongue caressing the underside of my dick. When I began to feel myself begin to throb even more, he slid up my torso, then sat up so he was kneeling on one knee in front of me.
