"I'm really sorry I'm your last customer here. I hope that's all right."</p> <p>"Of course it is!" she said with a smile that took on a wicked quality as she shook her head in wonder. "I had to bring you something special tonight. I hope you don't mind."</p> <p>"No, not at all." I was suddenly overwhelmed with my own feelings of pleasure. I was really happy to have pleased her. I had just had the best experience of my life and I wanted more. I didn't want to stop. I needed to do exactly that.</p> <p>"Let me buy you this bottle of wine."</p> <p>"Really?" I asked, completely taken with how beautiful her face looked.</p> <p>"Yes." she answered.</p> <p>I picked the bottle up, took a sips of the wine, and sat down in the love seat on the living room's sofa. "Let me help" I offered. She readily stood up and let me have my way. I knew that I was in for a spectacular night as I was.</p> <p>Lori was standing behind me, so I could tell that Lori was not wearing a bra. She slid the glass bottle down my chest and belly. When she got to my cock, she placed the glass back, slowly, and looked up at me.</p> <p>"I don't know how to say this but I am feeling naughty just thinking about doing this to you." She leaned back against the sofa's armrest, turned slightly, and lifted her arms over her head, letting her blouse slide from her shoulders down to her thighs. Her breasts were still covered by her sweater but the straps of the bra were gone as she turned her head to me and placed a kiss firmly on my lips.</p> <p>"God I want to do it." she announced simply.</p> <p>I was so overwhelmed it took me a half minute to understand what she had meant. I hadn't expected that. Lori didn't have any idea how to seduce a man into the act.</p> <p>I took her in my arms and drew her close. I kissed her, slowly and gently. She leaned against me, her tongue touching mine for the first time. I explored her mouth again with my own. She pulled back and looked into my eyes with such passion that I nearly jumped when I felt her tongue run along the side of my mouth. The kiss lasted for several seconds before she broke the kiss and whispered, "Please be quiet for a little while."</p> <p>"I'll be quiet."</p> <p>She pulled her head back from mine and looked me straight in the eyes. "You didn't ask me to do it." she said coyly. "It's ok."</p> <p>We stared into each others' eyes. She began trailing her fingertips along the line of my jaw, across the hollow of my throat, and down to the hollow of my throat. I could feel her soft skin as the tips passed over mine. She slid down toward my shoulder, where she rested her face against the edge of my neck, then started kissing my neck and along my jaw. It felt strange at first but then it felt wonderful. I let my fingers trail from her face along her neck to her hair and then up to her hair. I held her gaze for a long time, and then slowly moved my hands over her body, over her breasts, and down her ass.</p> <p>Lori took my cock in her hand again and slid it in beside mine. She had no idea how to make love to a man but she didn't care. Our fingers were working together in unison.</p> <p>While we were doing this my eyes were also looking directly into each other's eyes. It was the first time I had ever been able to look into those pretty eyes of hers. The moment of truth was upon us. I was about to enter her, completely.</p> <p>Lori looked at me. "It's ok," she said firmly. "I want you."</p> <p>She dropped her head back to kiss me. I felt her tongue probing my mouth and I opened my mouth, allowing her tongue to enter. I was so aroused that I barely felt it. Lori broke the kiss and kissed her way down my body. I couldn't believe that she was here to make love to another man but to actually have sex with me in front of me. I pulled her onto me, lying on her back with her arms above her head. I felt the heat between my legs intensify. I had never done anything like this before. It had never been done to me before either. I just took control of our lives and I was doing it now!</p> <p>Lori looked at me expectantly with a question in her eyes. I couldn't explain why, I could only say, "Let's go slow." And then I took her head in my hands and gently lowered her mouth to mine. I wanted to show her that I loved her, neededâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
