I had to bite my tongue to keep from breaking out into a smile. I was completely in awe of this man. When he came back to me, again I felt a little relief of our surroundings; he seemed to be in a better mood. He got down on his knees and began to stroke my legs with one hand while he caressed my pussy with the other.</p> <p>After a while, I felt him lean forward and kiss me deeply again. I reached out with my hands and began to caress his face and hair, which he also had a way with. His kisses were like those of the most experienced lover and I found he seemed to know exactly what to do to make me feel better. Once again, I felt the pressure building in me and soon a wave of pleasure swept over my entire body. He began to move closer, which only increased my pleasure and I was glad to feel him with a different viewpoint. I began to stroke and caress his arms as well as his face and his hair, which was completely different than my long hair. I had never considered myself as attracted to a man, but suddenly my arousal hit me, and when I let him have his way with me I knew that I couldn't hold out much longer. I could feel it building in me as his mouth moved to begin a slow exploration of my body. I was so caught up in the feeling that I just let him take my pussy and suck it as he had done with my mouth.</p> <p>He did what I had asked of him and made me feel like I had never felt before. He didn't just kiss up and down my body, he licked the sides, the hollow of my elbow, my arm and each of my fingers. He kissed and sucked my breasts for a long time, and I could feel the orgasm building inside of me building. When I finally got too hard to hold out any longer, I lifted him by the arms and turned him around so I could get at him from behind. I felt his ass tighten and felt the pressure as it lifted him out of the water. When I took him in my hand and rubbed his cock a little, the pressure increased in his body, and I could tell that he had enjoyed my touch. I wanted more, so I took him out of my mouth, bent him over onto his back and, as much as I may have liked him to move around, pushed the head of his cock up against his anus. As I felt it move into his body and felt his body give a little push, I knew I was doing what I wanted. I had always enjoyed getting double penetrated in the past, and now that it was happening, my own body could feel as if I had a part of him inside me. Just as quickly, it was all over and he was no longer able to move. I pushed him onto his back with my weight on him, and he reached for me, trying again to turn me over on his cock, but I held him back. I wanted him to finish first, but I knew he would like to be on his back, and this seemed like the most appropriate time to put pressure on his mind to ask me to enter him. I got out of the pool, wrapped myself up in a towel and left him a few moments before he jumped out of the water. Then I came back, and waited for his reaction. He was so beautiful, it couldn't have happened in a dream.</p> <p>"Was that really happening?" he asked, "I could probably fall on my face!"</p> <p>I could only laugh, thinking about how I would look in the morning, lying on my face, feeling his seed inside of me. "Hah," I said, "that was so sexy!"</p> <p>"I was really feeling it. I have never done this before, but something came over me last night, and I couldn't stop." He was so sweet, it didn't bother me too much. "It felt so good." Again, all the emotions were running through me and I felt so aroused with this complete stranger.</p> <p>"So what about you, how did you feel?" I wanted to see if this was truly possible, but this was my first experience with someone of the opposite sex, and I couldn't get over how much I wanted to take him all in. I couldn't just come to know him, I had to know him, and I could tell he really enjoyed what I was doing as much as I did, so I was a little overwhelmed with the idea that I could actually give pleasure to another person.</p> <p>"It felt very erotic," he said, "I felt so connected to you all at once!"</p> <p>"I had only had a boyfriend a few months ago. I was hoping you would want to do this with me," I didn't really know what I would tell him.</p> <p>"What? I thought I would like thisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
