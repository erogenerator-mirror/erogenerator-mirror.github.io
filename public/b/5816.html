I laughed, "It seems like there are more and more people around here."</p> <p>"Well that's not possible I guess!" he laughed. "Even more than five."</p> <p>"So do you like what you see."</p> <p>"It's not all that many!" He shook his head. "Besides, the man is a walking wet dream." He paused. "So, how much money do you have?"</p> <p>"Well, I figure I'll be living in the city by the time I am thirty."</p> <p>"Do you think that will change?" She asked suddenly. She stopped a few seconds and looked deep into his eyes. "I am no longer twenty," she answered in a soft voice. "Now, let's see how much time you've spent doing this!"</p> <p>She leaned in and softly kissed him. Before he could respond, she slipped her tongue inside his mouth which he began to suck gently. Her lips moved down farther and his tongue pushed further into her mouth. After a few moments of this intense kissing, he slid his hands up to her breasts. He cupped them firmly and rolled her nipples between his fingers.</p> <p>"Oh!" She exclaimed, "You are good at that." They kissed more frantically and his hands slowly slid out to her waist. He unbuttoned her pants and began to slide the zipper down. He pulled the pants completely off her body and lowered them down her legs. Her beautiful smooth white panties followed, leaving her completely nude except for heels and a thin silk scarf over her beautiful face. She stood at the edge of the bed, completely naked, but his naked body was close to hers. They stopped kissing again and he turned them towards her body. She looked over her shoulder at him and then ran her fingers through his black hair. She reached up to fondle his breasts again and then leaned in to feel his wet lips again.</p> <p>He leaned forward and reached around her body and gently pulled the scarf away from her eyes. He kissed her lightly on the mouth and then began to kiss her nipples. He kissed them first in the middle, moving slowly down each breast, avoiding her nipples altogether. He moved to the right side and then to the left. She closed her eyes and sighed softly at the touches of his lips upon her nipples.</p> <p>"Please don't tease!" She whispered and rolled over onto her back. He got on his knees on either side of her and began to caress the beautiful naked body he had uncovered for him. He knelt between her legs and began to lower his head to her pussy. He felt her hands move to the back of his head. He gently pressed forward to get closer, and the soft hair on his head tickled his nose. He had never loved a woman before and she felt so good against him. He pushed his head forward to try and taste her, but she wouldn't give him access. But he didn't last too long. And when he felt the strong hand on his head press him into her, he found his tongue sliding into her.</p> <p>As he continued his assault on her cunt, he felt her thighs tighten and open slightly, lifting her lower back up. When he felt the muscles in her legs begin to clench around his head, he began to thrust his tongue into her. She pushed her hips forward and pulled him deeper as she orgasmed again. The feelings of pleasure coursing through her body were so intense that she didn't care who saw. The only thing that mattered was how good it felt.</p> <p>She turned slightly to look back at him and smiled.</p> <p>"Oh, that was good. It was like I'd never cum that fast," she remarked.</p> <p>"I like that," he replied. Then he kissed her.</p> <p>"And you tasted fantastic." She said as they embraced.</p> <p>Just then, one of the other two guys, a young black man, walked into the room, wearing boxer shorts. He smiled at them and then turned back to the bedroom to wash his face off and dispose of it before being invited to join them. They all took their places and the older man lay back on the bed. His left-hand hand was busy in her pussy, while his right was resting at the top of her thigh above her knee. He began to caress his tongue against the soft skin of her inner thigh. She reached forward and began to rub her breasts that were hanging down, but she never stopped massaging them.</p> <p>She closed her eyes and reached out her right hand. He lifted his head and his eyes opened. They smiled at one another as they watched and waited until he raised his head to look at her. They looked into one another's eyes until they locked on one another's, then he slowly lowered himself down onto her. Her eyes never left his. He took a deep breath and began to rock himselfâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
