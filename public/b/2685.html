A friend is always safe, and this man is always loving.</p> <p>"Well I gotta check my e-mail if I can grab my car..." she said, walking slowly up to where I was standing in front of her. I grabbed my purse and stepped forward, trying to keep my eyes on her body. She was breathtaking! Not just beautiful, but stunningly sensual.</p> <p>"Hey man, do you have a car?" I asked, and her eyes looked down at me. Her smile told me everything.</p> <p>I smiled. "Yeah, I do."</p> <p>She looked up at me with a smile. "Well, um maybe I want a ride. Would you mind driving? I don't drive much anymore, you know?" I was still thinking about how she was always so happy to come to me.</p> <p>I nodded eagerly. "Sure, go on..."</p> <p>"You know... maybe, you can give me a ride tomorrow night. Maybe we can have a drink and a smoke?" She laughed.</p> <p>"Sure, I can try that... in fact, we can have a drink and smoke next time..." I was happy to have fun with this sexy lady.</p> <p>"You know, we can make it happen. I mean... why not, you know, maybe fuck one of my clients and..." she said smiling slyly.</p> <p>"Yeah, sounds like fun. Now let's get you home." I said grinning.</p> <p>"Uh, okay... I like it," she said with a nervous giggle. I took her in my arms immediately, and we immediately started walking towards the hotel.</p> <p>"Here, I'll show you." I told her, looking around. I opened the front door, and we walked into one of the hotel's better restaurants. I looked at her, and told her, "Come, let's order room service and meet back here in about an hour. We can order in later... maybe we can sit down while it heats up..."</p> <p>"Uhh... yeah, sure." She said. I didn't care I guess, as long as we had something to do. We got in to the car, and she leaned in to whisper in my ear. "Just wait till you see me there. And... well you already see me naked..."</p> <p>"Yeah, I know how horny I am right now." I told her as she started the car and pulled away. Before I knew it, it was 11pm, and I was waiting patiently by the door. I couldn't believe this woman was actually my wife! I had always known she was a little perky, but this was absolutely amazing! I could not believe how much fun this is! Well I have never thought of my wife in that way, but hey! Just being my wife, I guess it's safe for me. I couldn't believe I was finally in the position of being able to actually see my wife without fear of being caught. I had a new friend, and I was going to take the plunge.</p> <p>"So, what are you bringing me and the room service guy? I'll be right there!" I told her, walking around the car towards the door.</p> <p>"Oh... err.. okay." She said, still looking in the rearview mirror at me as we entered the elevator. Then immediately as the door closed, she leaned in to my ear. "So I guess you are in the mood for some... uh... company, huh?" she asked slyly. I nodded enthusiastically. "I have an idea." she said, and the elevator started to move slowly towards our hotel.</p> <p>We entered the room and walked into the kitchen to put the food before the meal came, and then sat down for a bit. We ate our fill, as we enjoyed watching the people on TV, and I was feeling pretty comfortable here. My hand was on her thigh, and I gently rubbed up and down her thigh. I couldn't believe my day.</p> <p>"Did I say I was nervous?" she said smiling.</p> <p>I nodded. "Yep." I said, kissing her mouth and her breasts. "Why don't you sit on the floor while I get your lunch ready. I'll be right back."</p> <p>I quickly got up and walked to the table, walking slowly towards the door. She smiled as she was sitting on the carpet, and leaned her head back onto the table. This was so sexy and so relaxing. I turned on some music and ordered for both of us.</p> <p>"Wow, I don't know what to say. I haven't done this in ages, but I'm actually really looking forward to it!" I told her, holding out my hand to get her food. My eyes were almost bugging out of my head.
