She was looking at the old boat, wondering what it looked like, especially in the daylight. Her husband moved to the front of the boat, got a bottle of champagne and poured them both a glass.</p> <p>"How's this?" he asked, looking it over while he raised a glass in salute.</p> <p>"What? No," he said, and then he moved down the steps and helped his wife out of the boat. They moved out onto the beach, where they kissed each other softly.</p> <p>"Where are we going?" she whispered as they walked back to the house.</p> <p>"Don't you worry, sweetheart," he whispered back, as he kissed her again. "I've been thinking about this all week."</p> <p>The afternoon passed quickly, and their loving was soon forgotten for the time being. For one of the few things they'd agreed on, they were going to stay at the house, so to speak. Mike was just happy to keep it over, and she was happy to do the same for him. He put his arm around her when she sat down, and she put hers around his neck as they kissed more passionately.</p> <p>Their kisses became more passionate, their tongues entwined, then were pressed open, and her hands moved all over his bare skin as they kissed. Mike felt her nipples harden and strain against the soft fabric of her dress, as she pushed him down, and he quickly reached out and began to knead her breasts through the fabric.</p> <p>They both broke from the kiss, and Mike moved his hand down to the hem of her dress, and began to caress her bare thighs through her hose and pantyhose. She sighed lightly as he worked his hard cock out of his pants, and spread her legs so he could reach her. He slipped his fingers inside her panties and quickly moved them down, to her feet and pushed them off in one motion, while he held them in front of them and kissed them for long minutes.</p> <p>It seemed to last for a time, as they both worked towards climax. She felt his breath on her feet, and he kissed each one as he stepped out of them. She felt his tongue on her stocking-tops, and began to work them higher in his mouth as he worked his fingers in her pussy, then lower until he had reached her clitoris. She felt his fingers move into her pussy and slide easily inside her as he began to rub her clit with his thumb.</p> <p>It was as she had not expected. She was on the edge of orgasm yet; she had never been with a man as strong as Mike had been when she had first met him that day. When she finally came, her muscles clutched at his finger until she collapsed back on the couch, panting in the aftermath. They both turned and quickly put her clothes back on, and kissed them goodbye.</p> <p>"I really must be getting back to your house. I hope you don't mind," he said as they walked back to their house.</p> <p>"Of course not!" she replied. "You're my friend here."</p> <p>"I can't believe this is what I've wanted to do all week," he said with a smile. "Why didn't you tell me it's yours?"</p> <p>He looked into her eyes. "I think you know just how I want us to be, but there isn't much we haven't done!"</p> <p>"Don't you get the idea?" she asked, already knowing the answer. "We both get what we want, and we have a lot more to do!"</p> <p>"I do like being your friend, sweetheart," he said, and they both laughed.</p> <p>When they got back to the house, the two of them sat down on the sofa again, in each other's arms. This new feeling, even though they'd just had their first sexual encounter, made her want to do much more. She started to kiss him again as he started to remove her panties. She stopped him and pulled them down.</p> <p>"There aren't any condoms in the room," she said as she reached for the box of condoms on the sofa.</p> <p>He smiled at her. "We can't use them, right?"</p> <p>"That's okay."</p> <p>He pulled his pants back on. "Let's get something in return for the generosity you've shown me."</p> <p>"All right," she agreed as she handed him the condoms.</p> <p>Neither of them had ever done anything with a condom before, so it was obvious she never intended to. Her heart began to pound as he opened the box and handed her a foil packet.</p> <p>"Don't worry," he said, "I'm cleanâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
