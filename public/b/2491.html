In a way, the idea of being in her hot body as she stood naked next to me, did not make her feel uncomfortable, but instead made even me more anxious.</p> <p>"I told you I was in my bikini," she said, turning around and letting me get my bearings.</p> <p>My mouth dropped open when it came to what she looked like wearing.</p> <p>"Oh my goodness," she said, putting her arms around my neck and pulling me tight against her. I'm not sure if she even noticed that my cock stirred immediately as it pressed against her lower belly.</p> <p>She was, in a word, beautiful. She was wearing a black, transparent, skimpy bikini, as well as a bikini top, which would have been enough to cause a woman to have the look of beauty.</p> <p>But, the bikini top would be something else on her. For the first time, I could see the dark circles around her nipple as it hardened. What would her husband say if he knew? I have seen him naked at least half every night since my arrival, so there was no reason to be embarrassed by my state. I was, after all, just curious to know what would happen if he ever came home, and was that any reason not to find out?</p> <p>Her legs spread wider at that thought. It must be getting to her; she is so much built up! I think I might go in the opposite direction of her.</p> <p>"Come on, lover," Lisa said at last. I followed her as she started to pull off her clothes. She was clearly more of a woman than she was pretending to be, and I could only imagine what she might look like standing there in just those little bikini's that would be able to cover her as much as she would want to.</p> <p>"Turn around, baby," she said.</p> <p>I turned and saw that she had nothing on underneath her, and was not the least bit surprised.</p> <p>"Well, if you don't mind," she said, "I'll be right back."</p> <p>She walked off as I was beginning to feel extremely guilty as I watched what she was doing to her husband. "Honey, are you feeling ok," I asked. My heart was pounding a mile a minute. There was nothing to go on. If she had a husband and child who really cared about him then why was she doing this to me. She must be mad at me for putting him in danger.</p> <p>But, his manhood, it's a cock, is only a small cock. It's not really any bigger than mine, it's just a little bit softer. I looked around quickly in case there were witnesses to what I was feeling.</p> <p>My fingers felt like needles of pain as I touched her nipples. She made noises and moved slightly, looking at her front as she did it.</p> <p>"Lisa, are you sure that's your nipple?" I asked, holding firmly and trying to stop myself from shaking.</p> <p>"Don't worry about that. It's nice," she said, moving her head and shoulder back, just enough to give me a view down her stomach to the junction of her thighs. I could feel everything.</p> <p>Then there is where we stand, between her legs, and I don't think even she has any hair left. Just an inch of hair above her pussy. If it were not for the fact that my cock was throbbing like mad, I would have had trouble getting control of myself from standing up and taking Lisa in a hug.</p> <p>"It's okay, we can see a whole lot," she said, running her finger down the side of my face. "Honey, what are you thinking, is your wife wet and aching for you?"</p> <p>This is it, I thought. How long will it be before I find out? How soon will it be before I see her and love her forever?</p> <p>She pulled me toward her, letting me run my hands down her back and around to her front. Her hands were all over me at that point now. She lifted one leg and kicked off her other shoe so that it rested on my shoulder as we made the short trek to bed.</p> <p>There, she put her head down onto my shoulder, kissed me once more and said, "So tell me about your wife." I said nothing. Her hand ran down over my chest and stomach.</p> <p>I know what I'm feeling right now. The tension and the anticipation of what is to come is all gone. It has been a while since I had been with a woman other than my wife.</p> <p>I think to myself. The question is, do I care to know at what point will she become awareâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
