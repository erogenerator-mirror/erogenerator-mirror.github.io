I looked to see Mom's face turning a lovely shade of red. It appeared that she wanted to tell me that she couldn't stay but knew what she was going to say to me if she didn't let me finish.</p> <p>"What do you mean by that?" she asked with a small smile.</p> <p>"I mean, if you want to go, and I get to stay here with you, that's okay with me. But for now, I'd like to sleep on the couch in our king-sized bed. And if all goes well, I'm sure a little extra spending time with you will help me get through the week."</p> <p>Looking at me with her serious face, she smiled and nodded, "I think you'll be fine without me. After all, you're my brother and all you have to do is come to see Mommy," she said quietly.</p> <p>"Moooom! Is everything okay?" I laughed.</p> <p>"Everything is perfect," she said and began to turn her head to look at me in the face.</p> <p>I stood up on my knees and looked down at her. I took a step to the far end of the couch, which I noticed was slightly ajar, so I had a perfect viewing of my sister's naked body. In fact, she had an even bigger view of my dick pressing on my jeans than I was.</p> <p>"What? Are you worried that your sister is going to freak out if you don't go?" I chuckled at that.</p> <p>She shook her head and smiled, "No, not at all. She kind of scares me a little but it doesn't do any permanent damage."</p> <p>"Do you really think that, right?" Now was the time to break the silence.</p> <p>"Oh, don't worry about it, I didn't say that. It's just that I still kind of want to see it."</p> <p>With that, I quickly unzipped my pants and pulled them out. The fabric came just in about six inches from her eyes, and I pushed my boxers down to my knees so that my dick stood up straight in front of my sister.</p> <p>Mom's head still turned away from me as she tried to avoid staring at that beautiful thing. Her gaze turned to the sides and looked to make sure that she wasn't distracted. A slow motion movement started and I began to slowly slide my boxers out until I was able to pull them out over my cock. I caught myself staring my sister's beautiful face more than most of my own. My erection was pointing straight at her. She didn't appear to be watching me as I slid them down my legs and off my feet.</p> <p>"You're looking at me!" she said, obviously embarrassed.</p> <p>'Fuck. Now I'm looking at my sister,' I thought to myself, 'if she is thinking about letting me watch her...'</p> <p>"I'm sorry?" she asked with surprise in her eyes as she looked up at me. She started to close her legs, but I quickly grabbed her hand and shook my head. "You're just not having me watching," I said as I turned around and faced her. She looked up at me with a worried frown.</p> <p>"What?" I said as I turned back around.</p> <p>"You're my brother. You have all these issues that I'm not going to deal with as you watch," she said with a shaky voice.</p> <p>"We're both adults here, so what...?"</p> <p>"It's okay to watch. There's no harm in letting you watch," I assured her. We sat back down and just stared at each other. All of my fears were forgotten suddenly as we both became comfortable watching each other.</p> <p>"I don't even know where to begin," she said quietly. "I mean, there was the kissing, and now I'm seeing you."</p> <p>I didn't hesitate; I was already feeling myself begin to relax as well, "I'll take that as a yes," I said.</p> <p>After a few moments, I asked, "So, I just have a question about...," her eyes widened, "your parents."</p> <p>"What?" she askedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
