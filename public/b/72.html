But she knew better. But then, "So that's why I'm talking to you now."</p> <p>"And that's why you're talking to me now."</p> <p>"So why is this guy here?"</p> <p>"Is this the guy you're talking to now?"</p> <p>"Is that where my question came from?"</p> <p>"Well, you know, it was at my gym, and you know I'm very active and the other guys are very, well, I guess you'd guess that. But you're still a little worried, so please answer now."</p> <p>"Well, I was talking with this guy in the locker room when..."</p> <p>"So he was your first customer?"</p> <p>"Yep, right there. He's my second."</p> <p>"Why do there have to be two of you working together?"</p> <p>"That may be his first, but we haven't talked since so that's not why there is a lot of extra work to do now. It seems like he likes you and I like you both."</p> <p>"Oh, I like the guy in you so much so I can't argue but, well it's obvious why you guys have been busy. Just don't let it destroy you."</p> <p>"I won't let him ruin us."</p> <p>"Why are you talking to me now?"</p> <p></p> <p>"Is it because I know what you think, that you may have feelings for someone you have met?"</p> <p>"No," I said. "We never spoke much about our families and we never had an honest discussion on either side of such matters. I mean, I'm not looking for an open friendship and I sure as hell hope it doesn't interfere with your relationship."</p> <p>"So you've made an assumption?"</p> <p>"I don't know, you know, I was just thinking what the guys would like to talk about in bed and I don't have a clue if they've both been with someone that looks like you."</p> <p>"I guess so," I said. "They're both probably young, and maybe not married, and not that attractive. If they were here then it would take a lot of convincing if they had both been with someone like you. And maybe, just maybe, I think they might be attracted to each other. So who do you think their attraction is? Would you be attracted to them? Are they your type?"</p> <p>Now here was the thing about my parents. I'm not particularly sure why, but I know they came into that room and saw them and didn't act like I was wrong. And I have to say that I don't really have to look too hard to see where they came from. I can certainly relate to them feeling things for me and that was why they hired me as a manager. If I can't figure out why they hire me as a manager, it's because I know all of my employees better than there are any others in this world. It's hard to tell if their type really means anything at all; which is why I hire people I believe is honest to god. I also have to admit that my parents were actually fairly nice to me. I'm not sure how they did it but I have to take the bull by the horns and have no issues with it. I just can't imagine what they might think if any of their employees, or someone else I hired them with, decided that they were all gay or bi-curious. If anyone could have forced something out of me then it would probably be me. That's okay by me because I've been with people who like you and they're not forcing anything out of them."</p> <p>Well, that makes a lot of sense. It's possible for people to not make such assumptions, but I wasn't about to have that done to me or anyone else.</p> <p>"I think that's enough of that for now," she said. "You've got a really great set of tits and you're not wearing a bra, so I imagine you're not wearing a bra in this neighborhood either."</p> <p>"So I see. And I do have a lot of experience with you since we're here."</p> <p>"That's pretty much what I've been doing with you. You're not in a relationship by any means and I like your friendship."</p> <p>"Why do you think that I think you're a bit much?" she asked.</p> <p>"Well, that's part of the problem. You have a very sexy and attractive person who just happens to be one of the guys at the gym. Now I know the guy at the desk, which is really no reason not to just be able to look at you."</p> <p>"So you're looking at me."</p> <p>"Yes, but I don't have a set of boobs. That's not entirely accurate, sinceâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
