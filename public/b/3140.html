"I'm a big girl. I think I'll be all right though."</p> <p>"I'm fine with it," I smiled, and held her hand.</p> <p>"Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to clean up this mess we made and make sure that no one can hear us. Then I'm going to get dressed and head home," she said as she walked to the door.</p> <p>"Thanks for everything, Sis," I smiled as she left, leaving me to grab my jacket and make a new one.</p> <p>It was almost ten when I walked into the shop. My sister was putting her stuff away. She had put a load of my things all together in the shopping center and had stacked them in the back. "Hey, you know I had a lot of work done and I think you'll like it," Sue said as she smiled at me.</p> <p>"If you don't mind, I'll just make myself a sandwich and sit there," I said quietly.</p> <p>"Sure, no problem." She went back to looking for the things I was going to do.</p> <p>As we waited for the food that came out of the fridge, Sue looked up at me and smiled. "Have fun today," she said, and we made our way to the front of the store to get our food.</p> <p>We ate together, both of us working as a couple and enjoying our time together on the shop floor. We chided each other about how we both felt, and made small talk until it was time to leave for home. Once home, Sue closed up the store, and I went to my new clothes. I had a short sleeved shirt, and since I was only about five foot eight, I was more comfortable than being a boy. I went and bought my new dress shoes, and walked into the bedroom. As we walked, I could feel two pairs of eyes on me, almost like a crowd. "Oh, my god...," I said to myself as I felt two pairs of male eyes on me. After I checked my other stuff out, I got dressed and went to my new living room to take a long hot shower.</p> <p>The next morning I got dressed and was sitting down when there was a knock at my door. I got up and answered it and was shocked as a beautiful woman in a beautiful light green dress walked in. She smiled at me from across the room. "Hey, hey...I thought you weren't going to come over last night. I was just wondering if you'd like to join me in the kitchen for a cup of coffee."</p> <p>"Sure thing," I smiled, "come in."</p> <p>"So, this is my SISTER?" She asked, looking me up and down.</p> <p>"Uh huh. This is her," I said smiling and walking over to her.</p> <p>"Nice to meet you," she smiled. She grabbed my hand in hers and pulled me towards her. We kissed passionately as I felt her body pressing against mine from under. I felt the heat coming off her as our tongues fluttered and circled around each other. It was intoxicating as my hand had the opportunity to touch her everywhere and I could feel the heat coming off her body.</p> <p>Once we broke our kiss, she looked at me. "So, how many women have you had this year?" she asked, a huge smile playing around her lips.</p> <p>"Not that many, just four. They all come from work."</p> <p>"Well, let's make it count," she laughed. "It must be pretty fun to make love for the first time," she said as I stepped back.</p> <p>Sue leaned in and kissed me. She looked at me intently as she held my face and kissed me hard on the lips. "You're very much welcome," she whispered, and pulled back and smiled at me again. She pulled away and looked me directly in the eye. "So, you're into all sorts of stuff with women, right?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm into a lot of things, and lots of lesbian stuff too."</p> <p>"Well, I've heard from many of your girlfriends that you just don't know about sex before you meet them. How do you feel?"</p> <p>"Wow. So far, you're going to make something of yourself," she giggled. "You should try not to act so bashful."</p> <p>"Don't be silly," I laughed. "Do I have to?"</p> <p>"Well, no. I just came here to make sure. I was just going to head upstairs when the first two guys came in to pick you up, I guess," she laughed. "But I guess now I have you," she added before she hugged me again.</p> <p>Sue went back to where she had been the previous day, just goingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
