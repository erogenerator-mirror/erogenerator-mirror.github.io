The way she looked back at me from those beautiful blue eyes. How could I have known the woman, that beautiful face? Even with her, that heart of mine, that beautiful look in the eyes; and yet that body, that body that body was so good for loving and caring for. She was my little girl, and she was now old enough to be my mother, no different at all from that picture and my own daughter, just older that I was being taken in our eyes.</p> <p>We had to go now, because a lot of us were going to miss her. But she just waved me up and down like a model as we walked around the city heading to her house. She lived a little over two miles away and we had to come there every weekend for a long weekend.</p> <p>As we got closer to her house, we started hearing that the police had called her about a missing persons car at her house. We didn't answer the call but one would occasionally be called to her house during the day to get the police information about the person, because the person that was missing could be seen coming home from work or something, either one of those things. When we got to the house she had already walked up and sat on a chair there and she turned to face me and I could see out of those blue eyes again, that look of caring and love there.</p> <p>I could see that we had been to her house quite a few times before and I looked down and said, "Yeah, I thought we were just going to hang out there a couple of times."</p> <p>She got up and moved back down on all fours. "Yeah, no, we really are just going to have a nice lazy weekend alone here."</p> <p>The thing is, though I did remember her from all those years ago, I can't put into words exactly why I had picked her up. I was really trying not to go there. This wasn't that much of a hang out anymore. This was just something that was going on between the two of us. She was still wearing her jeans and sweatshirt and her shirt had the letters "A" and "T" in it. If you ever go out there on Sunday's around here, you go look for her. I was going to do it this weekend but she was so beautiful I couldn't think of myself. So I put her down and she quickly said, "OK."</p> <p>I gave her a big hug and a little kiss and said, "Well, maybe you forgot about me for a minute. Just a few more minutes."</p> <p>She laughed and said, "You'll have to excuse all the other stuff I forgot about me. I got here a minute before you did."</p> <p>We talked for a while about how we needed to work some more to clear our conscience and what to do. I suggested that we just relax and just watch the television, and while she went back to the couch I went to her computer and started to see what kind of video that she was watching.</p> <p>She said, "That isn't important right now."</p> <p>As I started to type it into my new program she asked, "Is that what you were doing while I was here waiting for you?"</p> <p>I didn't answer for some time, "Is that what you were doing while I was looking at that porn site you always read about."</p> <p>She looked at me with an unreadable look in her eyes and said, "I thought you were just looking for a little something to look at, like my pictures."</p> <p>"Yeah," I said, "but not for long."</p> <p>She just kind of shook her head and said, "I don't think I'm ready for that kind of thing yet, if at all. I am glad we just watch a movie now, so there is still that little bit of time before the real thing comes to the screen," she smiled sweetly.</p> <p>"You got that right. This is what you are here for."</p> <p>After a while, I asked her, "Could we just watch some other movie?"</p> <p>"I don't know," she said, looking at me, then she looked down again, and there was this expression on her face, and she said, "Oh, I didn't say anything about watching some other movie."</p> <p>"But I would really like to, and I thought maybe you did it with someone else."</p> <p>"That's fine with me if you did," she said, "We just watched a porn channel earlier and then I had some really good porn."</p> <p>"But I'm afraid of breaking the tension and talking more. It would only make things so much more awkward."</p> <p>"Honey, we're here tonight, just watch, relax and relax. Just watch what I amâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
