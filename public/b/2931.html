We then got in the pool and went outside to cool off. We talked about what had just happened and I said that the truth was all over board with the guys and I admitted that was a hell of a high performance performance. Then I said that I just had to admit we had made a few big and bad decisions and were in a bind to fix the things about our life together.</p> <p>It was after this discussion that I started to tell the real truth. I was still a virgin and had just lost my virginity just on the other side of the spectrum. I confessed to having an affair with a doctor a while back and that had hurt pretty badly after a lot of soul searching and a lot of time and effort to find something to get off my chest. I had been honest about what I had done when I had lost my virginity and I asked for his forgiveness. I confessed to getting in a fight with an old man who had taken advantage of my innocence by taking advantage of my mouth and body. I also confessed to having sex on the first date but with him the most in charge. I also gave him a blowjob or two that had turned into an actual screwing for me. I told him I had lost my virginity too and he accepted it with more enthusiasm than I could bear, then, I got into my car and headed back home. I told him that I wanted to make the most of it this time.</p> <p>The guys were stunned but excited. We chatted for a while about my feelings and then we all drove off. When we got to the house and got into bed, one by one the guys started to fuck me and the others were the receivers of what I had started to say. It was really hard to put into words but I had no illusions anymore. I was going to be the only woman that any of the guys could want after these two guys, but what the hell. I knew I didn't have to say anything to make it worth their while so I went off like a rocket. I went to the bathroom and douched, and I took the opportunity to take a shower after. When I came back into the bedroom, I went to the dresser and put on my white shirt. It was warm but I also put on a pair of khaki pants. I sat on the bed and did my makeup for two hours. I then came back to bed so I could put on my panties too.</p> <p>The guys were gone but I kept thinking about making love to the both of them. I was getting worried and I knew I had to make the most of tonight.</p> <p>To Be Continued -â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
