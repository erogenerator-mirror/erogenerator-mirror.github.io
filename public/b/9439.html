No!"</p> <p>They were both laughing at myself when we finished our salads. She took a deep breath and said, "I love you. Now do me a favor. Get our wine. And, if you want to do something to thank me, I'll call you before you leave, OK?"</p> <p>We kissed again. "We'll be right back. Thank you so much."</p> <p>She leaned back and lifted the hem of her T-shirt up and off. She lifted the sides and said, "Let me give you a little of my panties. I'll bet you like it."</p> <p>I slid my hand down until I found her pubic mound and I found her slit. She was wet and she got wetter when she realized what was going on. As I slid two fingers in me and fingered her pussy, she was fingering herself with two fingers. Before long, I was rubbing her clit with a single finger. After several minutes, she said, "That's it. Do me a little harder, then a little faster. I really love the feel of this. You're driving me crazy. I'm so ready, John. Take me now."</p> <p>I pushed into her and she reached around and grabbed my ass and pulled me tighter to her. I went into her slowly and then she started a rhythm to me. She fucked me with her pussy. It was so sweet because I was just the right size to do it. Her breathing got heavier. She told me to start slowly. I went and picked up the pace. I could feel her legs trembling. I wanted to reach out and touch her so that I could give her a massage she enjoyed a lot.</p> <p>"I'm so close. Take me. Take me. Oh, John. I'm right there. Don't stop I'm on the verge." Her breasts were now bouncing as I pushed in hard. I was almost ready to cum. I could feel her getting hotter as she held me tight.</p> <p>"Oh God! Oh my God! I'm going to cum! I'm going to cum! I love you so much!" She went stiff then relaxed again. I put my left hand under her to hold her up. She was still bouncing up and down as I pushed her on her chest. She grabbed the sheets holding my thighs and kept me. I held onto it and my head fell back and my eyes closed. I started getting really tense. "I love you that much! I love you!" I held on to her for a few more minutes and then I started shooting into her.</p> <p>We lay there a couple minutes and then I put my limp fingers back into my mouth. I held her head and neck. She rolled over and kissed me again. This time it was nice. She said, "John, I love you."</p> <p>"I love you too. Bye and enjoy yourself." I smiled. She rolled over to me. We just held each other as we drifted off to sleep.</p> <p>We woke some time later and I looked at her. She had a goofy smile and she had a light smile on her face. I told her to get some more blankets from the bathroom and to get the rest of the bed. She took the blankets and did that. In the dark, I couldn't tell anything. In her warm, soft, naked body lying on top of me, it was just making me more relaxed. She turned around and faced out her eyes. I put my hand over her mouth and we looked at each other for a few minutes. Then I put my arm around her, as I reached my hand to her face. "This is nice," I said to her. "Now, I think I'd better get ready for a shower. What time might we leave?" I turned on the lights and went to get another drink then got up to go to the bathroom in the dark. I was a little surprised when she said, "Yes, we're not going to shower this morning. You take care of the shower."</p> <p>"Thanks for coming over. We'll have to get ready. I don't want to miss today. Can you come over the last night for coffee and a little breakfast?" I was a little confused but she just said, "Ok, I'll come over." I was sure that she wanted to make love to me again.</p> <p>I got the shower going and when I came back she was in the tub. She got out of the tub and grabbed a towel and wrapped it around herself. She came into the living room to get her things. She went and got her bag and we started out the kitchen. I took her to the door and she opened it. We kissed again softly.</p> <p>After a few seconds, I said, "If we're going somewhere, maybe we shouldn't go to the movies." I gave her a puzzled look.</p> <p>"I can't go to the movies.
