She was aware that they were watching and she also knew that they were watching. She looked up and there were only about half a dozen of them in the room. They were a mix of both genders and she wasn't sure if she would like them. If she did she might think that both would like the attention. It was a little disconcerting to be watching people who couldn't really understand a woman.</p> <p>She turned to look at the woman still standing next to her. Her hair still wet. It framed her face and made her look older somehow. She smiled at the man watching her. "Thanks. I didn't notice you. Have you been working out yet?"</p> <p>He nodded. "Yes I have. We're about the same size."</p> <p>"I saw you work out earlier. I didn't ask you to join us. Would you like to join us?" She asked.</p> <p>"Why not. We all work out together. I'm sure we would all like to join you." The man said.</p> <p>"Oh, of course. Let me put my clothes on and let you get comfortable." She said. "We'll probably never leave here."</p> <p>He nodded. He was still in shock by the look on his face. It was very strange to be standing before a woman. He wanted to be around her again.</p> <p>When she looked closely at him she saw that he was still staring at her. He was looking her in the eyes and it gave her a thrill. She smiled coyly at him. He shook his head. She smiled back. "Don't be angry with me and go ahead. I think you would have a good time."</p> <p>He shook his head and took a step back. He couldn't believe how strong he was. The muscles of his arms and shoulders were thick and hard. His chest was well defined and he had the definition of being an athlete in the gym. He couldn't believe this. Maybe he was an idiot.</p> <p>She was about six feet tall and had blonde hair that she kept in a pony tail. She stood on her tiptoes and kissed him. He was taken aback. She could see that he wasn't stupid. He reached out with both arms and brought her to him. He held her close and rubbed his face against hers. He could feel her heartbeat. It had slowed to a steady steady beat. This was what he wanted, what he knew would give him a lasting memory of this woman.</p> <p>It was almost like a slow dance. Her soft breath felt good on his face. He smelled the faint scent of a cologne. She smelled so clean and soft. His mind was drifting from the sight of her and its scent. Their lips met. Her lips were soft and warm. He kissed her deeply. He caressed her slender body with his hands and explored with his tongue.</p> <p>She ran herself up against him and started to grind her groin against his lap. He slid his hands up to cup her bottom. He cupped it, making her arch against him. She had a full firm bottom and he could feel the muscular flesh beneath. He squeezed her butt and she sighed her approval. He let his hands fall back to the bed. He could feel himself getting close to coming.</p> <p>She continued to grind herself against his lap. He was about to lose control again when she shifted her body slightly to give him room to release. She reached down to undo her pants. She slid her pants and underwear down and freed herself of them. He could see a neatly trimmed patch of dark hair on her mound. She sat back on the bed and spread her legs. She pulled his head between them. He took one half of her hair and wrapped it around his fingers. He tugged back and forth with his mouth, kissing and licking her. He would only stop once her legs were spread wide giving him complete access to her sex.</p> <p>She had to fight a moan of pleasure as his mouth made her feel incredibly good. She wrapped her arms around him and pulled his body tight against hers. She ran her hands over his chest and stomach and found his cock. She stroked it lightly as he licked her again. It felt wonderful to him. His excitement had increased every second. He pressed his dick against her body. He wanted to make her feel good. To make it feel as good as she was making him feel. She felt a little more at ease now. She reached for his cock, stroking it and feeling it grow in her hands. She wanted to feel it in her mouth. She wanted to feel it fill her mouth and she held still. She wanted to feel the feel of him.</p> <p>She turned his on his back and took his cock in her hand.
