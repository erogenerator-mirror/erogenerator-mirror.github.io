She knelt on the rug, and slowly parted his thighs. She kissed each thigh, then he spread his legs slightly. After a long, leisurely lap around his legs, she slowly got up over him and straddled him. She pulled his cock back into her warm, moist, and tight pussy.</p> <p>"Mmm," she whispered, "I have a surprise for you."</p> <p>"Mmm," replied John as his cock head disappeared inside her tight pussy. This was the first time he had been inside her in an exciting way. She was warm, wet, and tight, just like he had imagined. She had obviously been waiting a long time for this. She leaned forward and began kissing his nipples as she slowly slid up and down his cock. "You have no idea how much this is turning me on," she whispered passionately.</p> <p>"I'm glad it is," John replied.</p> <p>He had never taken a woman from behind, but he found it to be quite erotic and thrilling. He had never really been aware that another man could make passionate love with another woman in that way.</p> <p>He tried to imagine what it might feel like to have someone else's cock in his mouth.</p> <p>"Please, I want it in me," he whispered softly.</p> <p>He lifted his upper body up and leaned forward to kiss her nipples again. He pulled out the vibrator and pressed it against her clit and pushed it inside of her. She felt its gentle touch as he thrust it in. It seemed to stimulate her internally which felt good. It was not as intense as the oral she'd just given him, but it added a new level of stimulation.</p> <p>He moved the bed next to him to get a better angle. She sat on him, and moved her wet pussy up and down his shaft, each time moving a little closer to his face.</p> <p>"Oh, God I'm ready," he said.</p> <p>"I know," her replied, "I just needed to feel you inside me for a long time."</p> <p>He slowly pushed the vibrator up into her. She had his cock all the way in and had not yet stopped. They both closed their eyes and enjoyed the feeling of being totally connected to someone. He pushed the vibrator as far as it would go and moved his hips to get it in farther.</p> <p>"Oh, God, YES!" she cried as he started to fuck her with it. She lifted up slightly when the vibrating was all the way in, then slowly pulled it back out when in to a slow, steady rhythm. In and out she slid it in, in, out, he matched his rhythm, almost perfectly.</p> <p>"Ahhhhh," John called out as his fingers wrapped around the vibrator as his hands gently fondled her breasts. He gently rolled his head, nibbling her nipple between his lips and gently squeezed his own as his cock started to swell with each thrust up into her. She raised up and kissed him, then wrapped her legs around his hips as he continued to thrust into her.</p> <p>"Ahhhhh," she cried as her tight pussy pulsed around his cock, and she ground her hips into his.</p> <p>He felt his balls draw up tight, and he knew it wouldn't be long before he came. He started to speed up the thrusting into her and she felt it building to an end.</p> <p>"Oh, God. I'm going to cum," he said.</p> <p>"Yes! Oh, God... Oh, yes!" she moaned as she felt the hot cream inside her begin to boil.</p> <p>"I'm cumming!" he groaned and she felt his cock swell and jerk with each release.</p> <p>Eventually, he collapsed onto the bed and rolled onto his side. She crawled over him and kissed him passionately. She could taste her own juices on his lips and nose, and he pushed himself up out of the bed.</p> <p>"God that was incredible," he sighed, "but now I'm really not ready to go again."</p> <p>"You don't have to," she replied, "you're doing it now. You can fuck me some more after I return the vibrator."</p> <p>They kissed for a while, then John turned over, facing her. His cock was still standing at attention, but now pointing straight up at her. He looked at her for a moment, and then put his hand on the small of her back and slowly pulled her off of him.</p> <p>"Roll over, please," he said.</p> <p>"I'm not on a time limit," she murmured, "but I think we're both too tired to get up and get our clothes on."</p> <p>"That's okay," heâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
