You've always been fun to have around," she responded.</p> <p>"Thank you. I certainly didn't expect that."</p> <p>"Now why isn't that?"</p> <p>"I'll leave it at that. Please, please don't get in trouble for not calling me when you've had sex," she sighed without moving her lips.</p> <p>I could see that her mood had softened considerably when she had her words out.</p> <p>"What did you think of the idea of you having sex with him?"</p> <p>"Actually, that's not quite what I thought of at all. Actually," she took a sip of her wine, "I think what you're thinking is, that if he had told me that I wouldn't think you weren't good at sex with him - I wouldn't have come in and started fucking you. And I've been hoping for a repeat performance, so that I'm better off, but now that he knows you're on my wavelength - he wants some."</p> <p>"There's more. Have you ever had someone call you a sexy MILF?"</p> <p>"No, not at all. Why would you think I'd let someone, you? I mean it's just sex - well actually, I have actually. But you've also had more than a few men call you something I don't think is sexy. Besides, I've wanted somebody like you to fuck you since that first night. I guess the man I told you about who I used to be married and had the relationship with didn't want to admit that to his wife, but then, well, I guess it didn't really matter. Now, as for that second part of you being sexy, I've learned about that since the first time I heard you. Most of you could have been married, or had a marriage I'm sure, but not you. I think you're good at sex with a little extra effort. I'll have to talk to him on it," she explained, glancing down at what she'd just told her.</p> <p>"Oh, I don't want to do that. If we're going to do it, I think our sex life is going to be the same as it has been, right?"</p> <p>She was looking ashen. "Yes. It can be the same. This will be the first time in just a few weeks, to actually have sex and I'm not very ready to do it with somebody else."</p> <p>I'm surprised I'm still so interested in having sex with another guy. She has no clue what a pussy pleaser is. But then again, I have that little habit of wondering. And I do wonder about my wife's motivation. It's not that either one of us will be having any sexual relationship. I guess it's just one of the myriad of reasons why sex has been so easy. I don't know.</p> <p>"So what's there to work with? The first time you've had a boyfriend, I guess that has to be a good number of times. Then when you decide to have sex with someone else, you might as well be sure of it."</p> <p>"Well, it sure wasn't with Jason."</p> <p>"And you hadn't had sex with any other guy in the last five years."</p> <p>"No, I've never had another guy's cock inside me. I mean, if I like my lover to be pretty gentle with me, well, I really want to feel what it's like to feel his cock inside me. And it's not every night or even once or twice I have a guy here with me. And I really want to make him happy."</p> <p>We laughed at that. And I told her that had I felt any less sexually aggressive, I probably would have been just as eager. I was amazed that she hadn't been attracted to me at all. As for how it's gotten easier to get a new lover. What kind of a sexual woman she is, with all the guys out there who don't try to fuck her regularly. What's the big deal if that woman wants to have sex with someone she doesn't really know? Maybe she's just curious about it. It's not like she's gonna walk out of the relationship in any way.</p> <p>"You're smart to have had other men for a while before."</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess. A long time ago, I started having sex with him when I was just an innocent virgin. It kind of stuck with me till I met Jason."</p> <p>"I'm glad. Now, are you going anywhere with him?"</p> <p>"Not really - at the moment, anyway. I'm still trying to find out what his cock taste like, though I've never really tasted mine."</p> <p>I'd almostâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
