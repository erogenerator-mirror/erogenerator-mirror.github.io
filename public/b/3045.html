I didn't want to be alone now but my hand moved away from it's mark, on my neck, my back, making me think it was a real scratch and that it was not the scratch itself, it didn't hurt, it was a cold, wetness, and the feeling of the cold air on my skin made me shiver, goosebumps rose on my skin, as my mind struggled to fight the feeling of it's self.</p> <p>The sensation of the cool rain outside made me feel excited, like my body was reacting to it, like my eyes would light up the room.</p> <p>"Hello my lovely girl" a deep and familiar voice echoed in my mind. "You were such a good girl on my desk, so I took the time to give you something too."</p> <p>I looked up at him.</p> <p>He was staring.</p> <p>"What are you...Oh my god."</p> <p>I felt hot all over and as I stood there in a daze, he asked again.</p> <p>"Are you alright, my sweet girl? Would you like some more... Please?"</p> <p>With such a question in my mind, I nodded with tears on my face. After saying that, I took the phone again and handed it to him.</p> <p>"Do you want me to call him? And when he gets here to see me, tell him so. This is going to be a long and painful day and I will be in a good mood so just enjoy this with all the others around."</p> <p>I hung up on him then and after I gave a final thought to this and my hands were shaking in the rain outside the phone, I felt his strong arms around me from behind, pulling me closer.</p> <p>He pressed his face into my neck as he took the phone back and placed it on the bed.</p> <p>"Honey, I would like that." I told him.</p> <p>He put his arms around me and hugged me close to him. He smelled of cinnamon, sweet, and I felt him get hard.</p> <p>"Are you sure you feel alright? I mean you are shaking a little aren't you? I could probably tell, but I would just have to wait."</p> <p>I just nodded and felt so relaxed. He held me closely like he does to other men, and I felt excited to be holding him.</p> <p>"There's something I want you to tell me right now my precious one, but after the last bit of anger, I think I will go ahead. It's something that needs to be told to you as soon as possible."</p> <p>"Yes, please do, Sir." I said.</p> <p>He nodded his agreement.</p> <p>"I just want to tell you how much I admire you, and how much I would like for us to spend every day together, and even start our lives together, together. I don't want for us to end up in an apartment, or a car. I want to be your friend as if you were my dad. How do you feel about becoming your friend, your best friend, my babygirl?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yes Sir, it's great. Yes, it has been an adventure, and to hear from you, it has been something worth having." I nodded again.</p> <p>"I'll tell you where my car is, how to get to the station, how to park. Everything will be very smooth. I can't give you much to do at the moment."</p> <p>With that, he let his hands slid over my back and down between my legs gently rubbing my pussy as he spoke.</p> <p>"But before this gets carried away. If we don't do this, I'm not interested in you. If everything works out, we have some fun, but let's just go to sleep so we won't be late. The sooner we get started with this, the better we'll all feel."</p> <p>I could feel my heart start to thump. He was right, I really wanted to have this and there was no harm here.</p> <p>"I'll leave you alone right now, so let's get these clothes off so we can go, but don't you dare let me touch you..." I said, a sad smile on his face.</p> <p>"Oh god no no not let me, just don't..."</p> <p>"No babygirl, you don't want to be touched, just let me be."</p> <p>I couldn't believe that when I felt his hands lift my ass so he could get my panties off.
