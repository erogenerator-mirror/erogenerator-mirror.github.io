"Now, let's have some fun," she said, smiling shyly. "How is it that I don't have to pretend to love you?"</p> <p>"I'm okay," Kyle said. "I don't have to pretend now."</p> <p>"Then you must love me and only me," she said, giving him a soft kiss. She then kissed him on the mouth, while she slid her hands around him, wrapping them around his back, and pressing herself against him. He groaned.</p> <p>"Oh, you know," she said, "I've never felt that way about any man in my life."</p> <p>"Me neither," he said. She pulled his hips closer against hers, and wrapped her arms around his neck. She kissed him again, and this time, they didn't bother to pull away. Kyle kissed her back, and then he was on his back, on top of her. She kissed him again and he wrapped his hands around her neck, stroking her bare skin, as she stroked his hair. Then, after a bit of kissing on either side of him, she was on her back, with her legs on his shoulders, as he lifted his head up. For a moment, he just looked at her face, and then he started to kiss her again. For another moment, they were just kissing, until Kyle started to make more of the same sounds of delight he made when he tasted her, felt her body quiver under his. Kyle wanted to take his time. But he was just too excited. He made a mental note to go back to that hotel, and to bring back two of those.</p> <p>Then he started to fuck her.</p> <p>He loved her.</p> <p>He loved her big tits.</p> <p>He loved her ass.</p> <p>And he loved her pussy.</p> <p>And he loved her mouth.</p> <p>At some point, he was about to cum.</p> <p>"No, wait!" she said. She had already pulled off her panties, leaving them in a tangle behind her on the blanket. "Make me cum," she told him. "Make me cum before I leave here tomorrow."</p> <p>He didn't need any more instructions. He wanted to feel her body.</p> <p>He pushed himself inside her. Then he went back to kissing her mouth while he grabbed her thighs and pulled her hips towards him, thrusting more inside of her, until she was on his cock as soon as it was seated inside of her. He grabbed another handful of her hair and pulled her face towards his.</p> <p>"I'm sorry!" she said. "But it feels so good!" She leaned forward, put her hands on his chest, and began to thrust herself back into his lap. He held himself still at her entrance, but he kept himself fully inside of her, which she made all the way up, so that she could ride him. When he felt her body tremble, he knew she was getting there as well.</p> <p>When she finally came, Kyle nearly came himself. He'd already felt her legs tighten around his waist, and he'd felt her tight pussy contract against him, and his heart was racing, knowing he was about to cum, with her. She was cumming. She was cumming. She was cumming. She was cumming. She was cumming. Kyle grabbed her hips even tighter and thrust himself deep into her one last time, and began to cum himself.</p> <p>"Oh, yes! YES!" Kate cried. "Ah, yes!" With her legs wrapped around his waist, her chest pressed against his, her face buried in his neck, she arched her back, and wrapped her thighs around his waist, lifting her knees and back so she could wrap them around his back and drive herself harder and harder on him. His cock was twitching inside of her as she climaxed. Finally, after what seemed like an age, she came down, and they both looked at each other's faces, breathing hard, and kissed deeply.</p> <p>"Wow," she said, when they finally separated.</p> <p>"Yeah," he said. "I loved it, too."</p> <p>This time, Kyle wasn't sure he'd been able to hold it back for long.</p> <p>"I want to be in your pants when you get home," she said.</p> <p>"You're crazy, Kate," he said. She pulled down his zipper, and pulled the waistband of his shorts down, along with his underwear, so that it couldn't be pulled back up. "It's not fair. You're not getting anything, and you can't wear jeans either!" she said softly. "And I don't like you wearing pantiesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
