A single tear left her eyes and landed gently on his chest. "Oh, my God, I am so, so sorry."</p> <p>He looked at her and saw that she was sobbing, "It's ok," he assured. "You don't have to feel bad about anything. I think it was a good thing you stopped being so angry over this."</p> <p>"If you hadn't stopped trying to get me to forgive you, I probably wouldn't have stopped trying to get you to forgive me," she said, still crying.</p> <p>He reached out and touched her hand. Her fingers were coated in a thick layer of her own tears. "I'm really, really flattered, and it's so good to see you."</p> <p>They hugged tightly, holding each other and smiling at the same time. A moment later, they both slipped back into the back of his truck, but not before he checked the windows.</p> <p>He smiled at her. "Did you get any sleep today?"</p> <p>"Yes, but I couldn't think about anything except sex," she admitted, "I'm sorry for being so upset, and so upset with myself, I really don't understand how I can make it up to you."</p> <p>"Neither can I," he smiled, "You just need to let it rest. I'll tell you what to do. Get your things from your room and make myself comfortable, then come see me again. Okay?"</p> <p>"Okay, Mr. Williams."</p> <p>She turned and gave the handsome, sexy man a quick kiss on the cheek. Then she walked quickly toward her room, her tight little skirt swaying with each step. As her feet hit the ground, her eyes went wide and she couldn't help but smile, but she had no idea what to say or do next. She pulled her skirt off, folded them quickly and dropped them beneath her bed. She grabbed her panties and slipped them on her legs and walked toward the door. Her eyes ran up and down his body as he stood there, smiling a nervous smile.</p> <p>"My car's in the garage, so the whole house will be safe," he said as if he hadn't heard, "and I may want you to come with me."</p> <p>She smiled coyly at him. "I can't wait. See you tomorrow. Bye."</p> <p>As she closed his door, she locked it just as she had gotten hers, leaving it open. With a knowing smile, she walked toward the stairs to her room. The only thing she could do while she did so was reach for the door handle on the front door. With a quick glance at the mirror that was nearby and a final touch up of her skirt to her blouse, she hurried down the stairs, still completely naked, her nipples still hard, her pussy still soaked, and as wet as she'd ever been, she smiled when she stepped through the door, turned it closed and went back to her own room.</p> <p>The sun had set and the air was cool, so she lay on the bed, wrapped in an arm and leg blanket, her eyes closed and her thoughts going back to the previous evening. She must have slept in a couple of minutes because she didn't recall waking up. She knew she was a little disoriented but that didn't bother her. She figured she had gotten lucky this time, she was going to do it again. Her legs felt tired and she didn't bother lying down. But she needed to get up for the day and the two days she was going to have together. Maybe, if she made a plan, she could start to see him more often. She knew she wouldn't be able to keep her hands off of his body if he wasn't working at his job. But she wouldn't be in a state of constant arousal, it would be the least of her worst nightmares as she thought of her boyfriend and what they'd be doing as she lay there, her fingers deep inside her, stroking her body, thinking of the feelings he could bring her. She had never been able to resist that desire, even when she masturbated to orgasm when she was really horny. She was addicted, and she couldn't seem to get enough. She'd always enjoyed playing with herself after having sex with her boyfriend. She just hadn't been able to cum like this. It usually left her hanging before she even got off, but when she got done, she couldn't help herself for once.</p> <p>Her pussy had been throbbing and dripping wet for what seemed like hours now. She finally fell into a deep sleep, knowing it wouldn't be long before she came. There would be times, however, when she would come and it would not be as intense as last night. She knew that as soon as she came she'd have to take a showerâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
