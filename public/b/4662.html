"I want cum on your hot face. Cum for me."</p> <p>"Uuun-unnnn...yes...baby...yes...cummming," she said, her body tensing underneath him.</p> <p>Her hands were now at his head, pulling him down to their kisses, while she ground her pussy into his cock. Her fingers squeezed his face as if they were trying to squeeze cum out from his mouth, but the sensation of her warm juices coating their lips caused Brian's to be extra sensitive. Soon, both of their bodies were writhing on the floor, bucking against each other, the passion in every word.</p> <p>Just as Brian's cock stiffened up, he felt the first spurt fly into her mouth. But just as quickly, all of the tension was gone as the cock softened and slid out of her lips. They pulled apart, then hugged each other.</p> <p>"That was incredible," Brian told her.</p> <p>And that statement was all it took.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>Their first encounter was a blur. Brian would tell her a story about his first time. He told her that it was at his house, after being told that he would be joining a swingers club. It's not really anything he told her that night, but it was all he could think about. Finally, she agreed to be his "guest" for the night.</p> <p>Their first time together was the worst. The more he thought about what he wanted her to do, he was excited by the idea of what he would have to do. She agreed to be his "whore" tonight; maybe even better than before.</p> <p>Her face was very visible when Brian told her it was a club. It would look as if she were one of the club members now, with all of the "friends" and "likes" of her early history. He liked the idea of someone seeing their name tattooed on her lower back. He wanted her to get naked before joining. And he wanted her to be on display. It sounded too obvious. And it wasn't the word "slut" she was used to. It was the word "sexy" that he said she'd have to wear. A quick glance told Brian her face was flushed, and her eyes were sparkling.</p> <p>"But what if somebody..." he started to say, and almost immediately, she stopped him. "I want you to tell me how you feel," she told him.</p> <p>He had to force himself to look away, and he knew that she was thinking about what she had told him. He saw no way that he should give up. He said the first words he had heard in her ear since their last episode. She nodded.</p> <p>"Oh, shit."</p> <p>Brian couldn't contain himself any longer. He told her everything: he was so turned on that he was sure that it was going to be a long night, and that he couldn't wait until morning. And then, he was kissing her so passionately that he heard her say "yes." That she would let him eat her pussy, but that he knew would be for later. So, Brian wanted to do something for her. He wanted to make love to her, in the club, by herself, not in his truck.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>The only way he could find out what it was she wanted was to get her to change her mind and agree to come to the club the following day. And he had to prove that he was a big fan of it. He wanted to see this girl naked; make love to her and have his way with her. He wanted to take her the same way.</p> <p>But a quick check on his computer and an email on his phone told him that she was going to be there at 1 AM. Brian was nervous about this. He wasn't sure if she planned on seeing anyone. And after a month without seeing anyone, he didn't know if she would be ready to let anyone join her and even if anyone wanted to join them. But one thing was sure: it would be a long night.</p> <p>"You're a lucky boy," he thought and smiled when he heard her arrive. "We're going to come together."</p> <p>With that, Brian headed straight for the club. It was a large club, filled with couples that Brian knew from the swingers website, but hadn't met in person yet. Brian walked right up to one of the doors, and stopped on the steps. His excitement was apparent.</p> <p>"I can't wait," was the first thing that he said.</p> <p>Brian waited, waiting to see if she was excited enough to make the next move. He was looking at the woman who had just entered the club, her outfit consisting of a short skirt and whiteâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
