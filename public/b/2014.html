I'd love to watch you enjoy yourself," he said as he turned back to look at the picture again.</p> <p>"I'm yours," she said as she kissed him on the cheek. She kissed her man, pulling him around. She kissed his chest, neck and his right shoulder, moving lower. She kissed his right breast through the shirt, and then his left. Her hands went round his body, pulling at his hair and pulling him up closer. She kissed his chest and stomach while her hands caressed his groin. He moaned softly at the touch.</p> <p>When she kissed his nipple over and over till it was rock hard, he couldn't take any more, and pulled her away from the chair, grabbing her under the left arm and lifting her onto the desk. He stood her up and turned her around and sat her on the desk. His left knee was on the floor, her bent left leg was propped on his right thigh, his right ankle resting on his left thigh. She lifted her own right leg and reached underneath her to pull his knees apart. He bent back and lifted his right leg to move his knee to her left foot and to move around her in the same way. Again, her foot was supported on his thigh. He turned her around and placed her on his knee, turning it over and placing his right knee on the ground, placing her hand down at the front of his shorts.</p> <p>Her hand went up onto the front of his shorts, her grip on his cock firm and ready. She pulled her hand slowly from his shorts.</p> <p>"Come on," he said with a devilish grin on his face, "we have more to do."</p> <p>She started to get up on her feet, but was stopped by his grip on her by her left leg, and her hands came out of his shorts, running up his left arm and to his back. She let go and stood up, stepping back from the desk and pulling him with her. She sat down on his lap and rubbed her hips up and down against his throbbing cock. She kissed him while she unzipped his shorts. He lifted his hands up to feel and grab her ass, she pushed the waistband away as they both sat down. He brought up his hands up and grabbed her tits under the shirt again, squeezing. She started to feel his cock again and rubbed him with the lace fabric.</p> <p>"You do this a lot, do you know how?" she moaned.</p> <p>"I've got a lot of things that I've dreamed about, you know what's in my heart for me?" he asked</p> <p>"Are we going to fuck?"</p> <p>"No," he said as his hands took over, pushing the front of her shirt up to expose her left nipple, "but I'm going to start with you naked." He leaned closer to kiss her and as his lips closed over her nipple she started to undo his shorts. When they both had released her nipples, she started massaging his cock with her right hand. He started to lift her shirt over her head and it ended in a button of cotton that had the word G-string in it's place. He leaned back to look at the exposed skin as they took off each other's shirts. He kissed her lower mouth, before pulling her into a kiss. She kissed him before pulling his shirt off, breaking the kiss only to pull on his shorts and unzip. He helped her pull them off, and she removed her own shirt.</p> <p>"I love the feel of your skin on mine," she said. As she rubbed his cock she pulled the shorts from his face, exposing himself to her eyes. She bent her head as he took his head in his hands and gave her a passionate kiss as she slid her panties down. She took his cock in her hand and started to masturbate him while kissing his lips with her tongue. She ran her hands all over him and brought them to her nipples and started to gently squeeze them. Taking his head, she slid it into her mouth and sucked her own juices off of it. She started to move her tongue around it, making a noise that sounded like "Fuck." He started to pump his hips up with her mouth. Using her mouth for her pleasure, she sucked his cock until she couldn't take his cum any more. She pulled her mouth away from him and started to go. He grabbed a tissue from a roll, rubbing his eyes in relief, "Not yet."</p> <p>They both burst into laughter when they saw the large hole in the ground with several feet of snow. It was the same hole that they had fucked in once, and she was laughing the whole time. He pulled himself out of her mouth and they sat on the snow in mock wonder. The hole was slightly open, from the cold outside, but with a little snow on it, it was like an actual hole and there was aâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
