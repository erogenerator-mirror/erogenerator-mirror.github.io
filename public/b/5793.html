And maybe you don't want to see any of my brothers because they might be right when you say you won't feel any of them any more, do you understand?"</p> <p>My face fell.</p> <p>"No," I responded. "You are going to need to do everything I tell you, until we get back together. You are going to do the same for me. I won't try to control what happens or how you spend your time, but I will let you know on Sunday if I start to worry you might get scared or think that I don't like you. In fact, I will always be your lover."</p> <p>A strange silence followed as I thought and decided what to do with my new boyfriend.</p> <p>"We'll talk again some time now, and you're going to have to tell him you like me and he'll forgive you," I said with conviction. "Let's talk before next week."</p> <p>I could see him trying to look sad. He started to pull his shirt over his head but then stopped when my arms pulled him toward me for a hug. I pulled back but his hands stayed in front and he looked confused.</p> <p>"I can't do this!" he told me. "I mean, my parents are only my second and most important. I don't even know if I really like them. I just don't trust myself to be a total slut, especially when that bastard of a husband is always trying to get you to be a slut. And I just can't."</p> <p>With all of the drama in my head, I realized that I already had a problem. What is going to happen is very dangerous. I couldn't trust myself not to be a totally slut. He couldn't trust my boyfriend to look out for me enough to forgive me. He could never trust me in my own house, even if it was for just for a night with his wife. What was he going to tell my mom that I was not to worry about my family or my sexual education?</p> <p>The next day I asked Matt to stop by my house for dinner. He started to get up but found some paper in his pocket and went to the refrigerator. He took out some grapes and opened them in the refrigerator to give me a chance to eat before he made himself a sandwich. We ate on the balcony overlooking the lake and watched the waves break on our patio. My boyfriend had gone to bed early and was still under the covers so I had to get ready before I would have to go for my first period.</p> <p>The next day I stopped by Matt's house. I hadn't noticed it for the past week or two but it was a bit of a turn off. My parents had always wanted to be able to pick an open door when they were getting ready for school without looking like whores. So much for thinking ahead. He was not really his father's age and his mother was a pretty young thing until she had passed. As I entered the house I noticed that there was only one bathroom for Matt's parents. The kitchen where they usually cooked dinner was off to him. This time it was a closed sign as he usually had to be in the shower. He had left the door ajar and I had never seen him in the bathroom before. It was a good sign because I would always have a hard time getting in unless he sat behind the closed door.</p> <p>"You sure Matt?" I asked him as I entered the door.</p> <p>"I'm sure!" he assured me.</p> <p>The bathroom was large and modern on purpose. There were two showerheads and a tub and tub combo. In addition there was a small bathtub with an en-suite shower. There wasn't a large shower in the house, so there were plenty of space to shower. He had to pay the price to get a shower. He had to pay the front room charge as I would have to walk in on him and his parents having sex in the bathroom.</p> <p>"How did things go today?" I asked him.</p> <p>"Pretty damn good," he answered honestly. "There are a whole lot of things I like to do besides just having sex."</p> <p>"That's good!" I said as I saw the worry on his face. "I don't have much time, but if you want to help me I'll be happy to help."</p> <p>"I'm not as much of a doctor as you think." He told me.</p> <p>"I can't take you up on this," I said, trying to change the subject.</p> <p>"Do, you'll have to give me something more than just a massage," he said. "I can't really leave my mom alone but I could use someone to get me off."</p> <p>He was a good boy as thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
