I couldn't go in either, my heart was doing somersaults. Her smile was just as seductive as her face was sexy.</p> <p>"My place?" I managed it. My body wasn't sure if this was me or not.</p> <p>"Are you going? That's not it."</p> <p>"It's no good, I have a place we can go. Can we go?"</p> <p>"Sure," she said, a smile on her lips and a smirk on her face. We walked toward her apartment, we made our way in silence.</p> <p>In her apartment, we made the coffee and sat down as we finished. We got to the point when it felt awkward and awkward, we knew that for some reason there was something between us. But at the same time, it was more than just a feeling of jealousy over the night out. But now I felt a little better, I felt loved.</p> <p>She pulled out her chair, "I'm glad you decided to come in. I've been looking forward to this. I just wanted to get you out of the house so that you can come back, and you can finish your own beer." She gave me a light caress through my clothes that felt so good, it made me smile.</p> <p>I took a drink and then put it back down when she pulled something out of her purse. I didn't know what to expect but here we were, coming into her living room for the first time.</p> <p>"Where'd you keep it?" she asked as she took a gander at it.</p> <p>"Here," I reached out in it and opened it up.</p> <p>"Oh!"</p> <p>With that it started to make sense. She looked over at me. I smiled and she smiled back. I took another sip of my beer and then took her hand.</p> <p>"Let's go."</p> <p>We started up the steps and I felt the rush of adrenaline that seemed to surge through my body. She pushed me off and went to the refrigerator on the other side of the kitchen. I followed her and she turned around to get a drink. I followed close behind and we sat to her kitchen table. We drank some more and then we sat on the kitchen chairs again, my knees rubbing against hers. It felt just right and I wanted her right then and there, and I felt the excitement.</p> <p>She started to take off her shirt, but I stopped her.</p> <p>"Shush honey, you're driving me crazy. I want you naked," I said seductively to her as I unbuttoned her shirt. "I want to see your body," I whispered to her.</p> <p>"That's a wonderful idea," she said, still a little unsteady on her feet. She pulled away from me again and got her sweater off over her head. The bra underneath wasn't particularly small but I didn't see anything like me had. Instead, I saw something I'd never seen before, a nipple between two small, erect nipples. I looked at her and then back at the breast that I wasn't looking at. This was the same dark brown nipple that I'd seen a lot of times. I bent my head closer and licked the nipple, taking it deep between my lips and suckling it. I loved it. It felt so good.</p> <p>"Ohh, that's nice," she moaned. I started to move even closer and lick her other tit.</p> <p>"You like that don't you? That's real good. It makes you feel good doesn't it baby," I said licking her nipple.</p> <p>"Yes...yes it does," she moaned, then took my head in her hands.</p> <p>Again, I started to move my hands with her breast which was now in my face and my hand on her other breast, massaging the other. My lips found hers again. Her lips parted to allow my tongue entrance before she pulled my head close and sucked it between her lips in an intense kiss with my tongue.</p> <p>"Oh yeah," she said, pulling away so just her lips were touching mine. Then she did something else.</p> <p>"Oh my," she said breathlessly.</p> <p>Suddenly she took away my hand and reached back to unbutton my jeans. "Hold on...," I said as I grabbed her wrist. She looked at me with an eyebrow raised and a slight smirk on her mouth and I knew what she had to do. She quickly pulled my shorts down and I helped her pull them off leaving myself naked.</p> <p>"You ready to go," I asked as my cock twitched in response to her fingers on my skin.</p> <p>"Yep," she said.</p> <p>"Well it doesn't really hurt to take off your bra," she said as she leaned forward so that I could pull her bra off herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
