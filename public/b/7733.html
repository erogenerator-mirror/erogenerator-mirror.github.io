Then I said "Let's dance for a little bit, girls."</p> <p>As they began dancing with each other to the slow music, I could tell that the guys were getting turned on by the show. They were all taking their time. In addition to Pam there were a number of guys with hard cocks sticking out of their pants. In all fours were two of the hottest, most gorgeous, and the most beautiful girls. The only thing that would have made it better was the guys being on display.</p> <p>The guys were all enjoying the show and they were giving me just as much attention as me. It didn't seem to matter if it was for the other party and my own enjoyment.</p> <p>At the same time some of the more aggressive guys started to rub their hands over Pam's ass and then up and down the sides of her legs.</p> <p>"You like that, don't you?" Pam asked in a teasing little girl voice, although she was obviously enjoying it.</p> <p>"Oh yessssss!" Pam encouraged.</p> <p>"You like when guys do it?" I said to her.</p> <p>Pam answered, "Yessss! Oh god! I like it. I like it so much!"</p> <p>I moved in for a quick peck on the lips from Pam and then said, "Let's finish the song."</p> <p>On the other end of the dance floor the crowd was mostly composed of those who liked girls and the guys. At the start they all seemed to be enjoying it as well as the guys.</p> <p>After the slow song was over I said, "Let's move to the next dance. We are about to start a new tradition."</p> <p>With that I led the girls to the dance floor.</p> <p>With the music playing loudly I stood beside Pam. "Let's dance again!" I announced.</p> <p>I held Pam's hand and led her over to where she could feel and see the guys standing there. I held Pam's other hand and put hers at the back of mine. As the girls moved quickly back to the center of the dancers, I pulled her close and said, "You look so hot with the boys there!"</p> <p>Pam stepped back and looked around the dance floor. Several guys had moved in to dance with her and others were dancing or looking. The only thing of note was two guys were standing by her side dancing with her.</p> <p>I was having a good time watching the guys move around, but also trying to make Pam as hot and horny as I could. I tried to tell my buddies to stay out of the contest between us. But I had a lot of trouble finding them, as I knew they saw right through me. My buddies were also having a good time watching Pam being kissed while being groped and used. I kept trying to let them know that Pam felt free to go as far as she felt comfortable as we all wanted her to. But when I did I was not sure that they saw how much of a whore she was being. What about the guys behind her? What if they saw her lips or the way her skirt fell?</p> <p>The girls were dancing so close by that the guys could really see into her back. I could see a bulge from the guys and the other guy in front.</p> <p>Just then I leaned in as the song ended.</p> <p>Pam whispered, "I would love to have another chance to dance with a guy right now."</p> <p>I nodded, got to my feet and moved back to the dance floor.</p> <p>The guys were still holding onto Pam, and she moved with them. I watched as I swayed my hips to the beat of the slow song. The guys were looking right at her hips and the skirt of her skirt as she moved back and forth. This was a turn on for me. Watching the men dance was also exciting for her. This was her idea for the night. I don't expect that she was actually being wanted to dance to a man by that big pole. I think she wanted to fuck a guy who was looking at her the same. And when they were away she could tease them by flashing her panties.</p> <p>Pam leaned forward with her hands and said, "It's a turn on for you to see all these men looking at your tits."</p> <p>"Oh, Pam I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry." I said with a disappointed expression on my face. She put her arms around my neck, which made me think she was being even more of an erotic temptress. We swayed a bit and started to move the guys back around on the same dance floor.</p> <p>Pam whispered to me, "Please dance with me as we dance."</p> <p>That wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
