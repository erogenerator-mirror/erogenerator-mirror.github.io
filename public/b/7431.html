And she saw my dick, a big thick one, and her mouth went right down on that.</p> <p>She kept sucking my dick until I came in her mouth, and then she licked her lips.</p> <p>I didn't want her to look at me, at least, not this time. I went to the shower, got dressed, gave her a quick kiss on my cheek, and left, and had a quick good-by kiss to Mum, and I left, and was back in my car, driving to church.</p> <p>A short while later; I was in the church. I had a good time. The place was crowded with people, but I didn't see the other pastor or priest. I spent an hour there, and then went up. And I had a great meal, and as soon as I had finished eating, a really good one, and as soon as I was done, I had a few people standing to watch me and mom having a good night's meal.</p> <p>Some people went onto the street to eat as well, but it was quiet and, at last, it was time to go. So I went home in a taxi, changed into some of the clothes I'd seen on the internet, got ready to leave the house, and left for my house. I didn't wait around that long, but finally went into my room, undressed, and went into the shower, showering. I got out and walked naked into my lounge chair and lay down on my back on the bed. Soon there were lots of people, but not any of them where that I would see later. A tall, thin guy on the lounge chair stood up from his chair and moved a couple of steps towards the door, but he went very close to the door when he got to me. He was on his own side of the door, and he held the door open for a few seconds. From then on there was a couple of others, but none of them seemed to notice at first, and they stayed close to the door as I got dressed again.</p> <p>After I got dressed I went in to see dad.</p> <p>"Hi, darling," I said, kissing him on the cheek, "You looked so good, so beautiful that time we had."</p> <p>"Hi dad," he said.</p> <p>"Come in darling."</p> <p>"You look good too, dear, I can see how much you appreciate being dressed. Do you like to come and put your hair down. It just seems natural for a girl your age to be here," he laughed.</p> <p>He smiled at me, still naked and in the shower, and I told him that I loved to come and look after my girl. He smiled back.</p> <p>I walked into the kitchen and started cooking. I had brought a couple of beers and two cans of pop to cook, and we sat around the kitchen table and watched the meal. I put a couple of my slices of cheeses together in a plate and put one on my plate. We just ate and watched the movie and drank, talking, talking, and feeling the whole time. After some time I said, "Can I make one for you dad?"</p> <p>"Oh, I'm not a big boy."</p> <p>'I like that, darling."</p> <p>"I thought you didn't, really, that's only for girls."</p> <p>"I'm not going to spoil. Why don't you put some music on and we can dance to it together. It's a dance so no one can see us. How does it feel to sit and talk for hours," I joked.</p> <p>"Oh, it does feel like that, isn't it."</p> <p>'It's just like old times, and not as much fun as it used to be. We can sit and talk and sip on wine and laugh all we want. You know, maybe I have forgotten the whole old time we took this holiday, so maybe we should take it back."</p> <p>He sat silently at the table. I took some cheese out of the fridge as we ate and sat down to watch it. Then I walked round the table and sat beside dad, leaning over and holding the back of his head. He put his arms round me and we drank some wine. He was really good with the tongue, and even I could tell that he had done it quite a lot with his tongue. Then he said, "That's lovely dear, that's wonderful, you know how to kiss, don't just lick the bottom of a piece of bread."</p> <p>I felt his tongue on my lips, and, although I hadn't done anything just yet, I gave him a kiss on the lips. I loved the feeling of being held at my daughter's door and at the same time being held at the door of another's home for so long, and Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
