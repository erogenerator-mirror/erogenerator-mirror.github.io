I was so happy I could barely hear him laugh or breathe.</p> <p>We were both exhausted after another long day. I finally awoke with him cuddled as close as he could get without strangling me. We both looked at each other.</p> <p>When we got out of bed and realized our lovemaking had been a little different, not to mention that it would have been a much more satisfying experience if we didn't have to deal with it at that point. But I would gladly have enjoyed that very much.</p> <p>He walked me to the bathroom and gently rinsed me of both his cum and my own. I was so contented watching myself in the mirror. He turned me around and kissed me and turned off the shower.</p> <p>We got dressed and just enjoyed the rest of the day. I felt as alone as I ever had felt in my entire life. Maybe because neither of us was looking at our own spouses as I felt happy, at peace.</p> <p>He seemed to be able to read my mind and I couldn't help wondering if maybe it was some sort of psychological game. It seemed like a game he was playing that I thought, but I had no idea. I did know something.</p> <p>He gave me a call from the other bedroom and told me how he had ended up in that same motel. He had bought a room in a different city, he had a business name and he was one of the most powerful men in the country. But he had also met a woman before and when I told his wife it had worked out.</p> <p>We arranged to meet the following week to visit a couple who I was working on a case about.</p> <p>We had dinner together and enjoyed some new wine. Then we took a stroll on the beach. We looked around and decided to go back to his place.</p> <p>It was a beautiful, crystal blue and I loved the view. He asked me to dance, but I said I wasn't really all that into dancing.</p> <p>"Why don't we go back to the hotel and then go get something to eat?" I asked, taking his hand.</p> <p>He smiled and pulled me into his arms and we danced very closely. I wanted to keep that close, but then he suggested it might be better when we got back to his place. He led me back to his truck, picked me up, and kissed me long and hard, and then I felt him putting my clothes away and giving me the keys.</p> <p>When we got into his room I found that the lights were still on, and with our glasses in hand, we got undressed.</p> <p>We got into bed where he lay on top of me and his cock was just in my hands. We made love, both of us doing each other very gently, neither of us using words. But both of us knowing each other's feelings and desires. There were no words, just the feelings of lust. After he had come inside me he rolled off me and went into the bathroom. I felt him rubbing a towel over my belly. Then he asked me how I liked it when he gave me a bath. I told him I liked how he used a big white towel to wipe and stroke his cock when I'd come down the hall or the elevator.</p> <p>Then I felt a little weird being naked while he was washing. I think I was hoping it wouldn't be too embarrassing to feel like I was the only one in the room. We never said much about what we both thought about, he just did what he thought was his part to keep things cool.</p> <p>We both slept well in the morning and I had a long day at work. It was very stressful at the job. Our days were filled with meetings, but we kept our hands off of each other. At the end of the day we both realized it would be another busy week, but it was a good vacation. It was a good day at a time, no distractions. The two of us went out to enjoy another wonderful meal and I left to go to the bathroom. He came back in a very short robe and said to me he had to pick up something for me to wear.</p> <p>He told me he wanted to go shopping. He told me to come back to the motel and he would pick me up.</p> <p>He took off his robe and I followed him to the truck. I looked at his cock hanging there under the towel.</p> <p>"What do you think of your day?"</p> <p>It was his turn to look at me.</p> <p>He said,</p> <p>"I really enjoyed it last night and I hope I can do it again."</p> <p>He leaned against the door, turned his head to me and kissed me, and then he asked me if there was anything else he could get me.</p> <p>He leaned in close to me and I could smell the wonderful scent of soap and soap. I kissed him and told himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
