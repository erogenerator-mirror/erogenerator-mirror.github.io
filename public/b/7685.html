To this day, though, my cock still twitched, as she slowly stroked it from the base to the tip at every stroke.</p> <p>After a while, though, her eyes fluttered closed, and she stood up. Turning around, she slowly started to ease the dildo out of her body, and pulled it all the way out, letting the head nestle against her pussy lips. She looked deep into my eyes and purred, "Don't worry, just get down on your knees and do it."</p> <p>"Don't you dare," I gasped.</p> <p>"Of course I am," she purred, "but just make me cum again. I need to make you cum and fill me up... and then make love to me. I need to cum."</p> <p>I quickly sank to my knees and put my face between her legs, kissing them and feeling their warmth and wetness all over my face and neck. She reached down and pulled my head up, "Do it!"</p> <p>My heart was pumping furiously when I felt her hands grab the back of my head and begin to guide me away from her pussy. I let her guide me back where I had been, and then her hips lunged forward, and I dove in, lapping and kissing the dripping folds of her sex. As I started to lap her out of gratitude for cumming so soon, I felt the warmth of her pussy envelop my ears as she ground herself into my face once again.</p> <p>The feel of her hot wet flesh against my tongue was almost too much for me to bear. It took every bit of strength I had to resist pushing into her and moving my hands to her waist, but my desire to please her continued to build. I could tell I was already getting near there; her body had been so hard to control and yet I was so excited at the possibilities of what I was experiencing right now.</p> <p>I pulled my face away from her pussy, and took a hold of her thighs, spreading them to take the weight and hold of her fleshy ass. With a final swipe of my face from her thighs to her pussy, I looked up to see her expression, smiling widely. I felt the warm rush once again start to overtake me again, even as my cock strained against my pants. "Do it!" she said.</p> <p>I looked back down at the base of her ass, knowing what it wanted. Then, when she let me get a good look, I pressed my middle finger against her opening. With a couple of more strokes, I pushed the tip of my middle finger inside her, and my forefinger began to rub across her g-spot, just like I had found her body to rub my cock so well. Then, slowly, almost reluctantly, I pulled my finger out of her and pulled her ass up off the ground. She reached forward and grabbed me by the back of the head, holding me in place, and brought me to her lips again.</p> <p>She tasted delicious, sweet and musky and allured. I knew my own arousal built even higher, as I felt her tongue licking and teasing my finger and her pussy muscles. It made the sensation between my toes go all the more intensely, and my cock even more desperately trying to get hard again. She took my hand and placed it back on her ass as she held me down.</p> <p>"Do it," she urged me, softly enough that even I had no trouble hearing. "Put it back in."</p> <p>I slowly pushed it back into her, holding the base as I held her ass open with one hand. I moved my other hand over her ass and began to gently massage her, feeling the muscles and folds of her cheeks and pushing inward, until I bumped my finger up against her asshole.</p> <p>Her mouth was still sealed shut, but her eyes were still closed, and she was panting heavily, as I pushed inward. Still holding her ass open with one hand, I used my other to slip her other hand and her lips apart. Then, my finger pushed the tip of her sex against the tight entrance. With a little resistance, it popped through to its full depth in one long stroke.</p> <p>She gasped and groaned, "Oh my God."</p> <p>I looked back over my shoulder at the ceiling, and then slowly pushed in again. With each stroke, her hips lifted and pushed down onto my finger, as if trying to drive it all the way inside her body. Soon my other hand and her ass were both pressed against her, and I pulled out a bit before plunging it back into her. I looked around to see that some part of me had become detached, and was merely watching what was happening in front of me. Her face had twisted up into a mixture of lustfulness and sadness, and her fingers were stroking her clit.</p> <p>With my free hand, I reached for my now hard cock, and pressed it back againstâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
