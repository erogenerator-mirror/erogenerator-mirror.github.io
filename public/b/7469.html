You know what the best fuck is. Hell are you not even twenty-five?' He asked, as he layed himself between her legs and began to fuck her.</p> <p>'It feels like I've had a bucket of dry jizz in me. It's so bloody cold in here.' She said, not saying a word.</p> <p>'It's bloody cold here! Here, I'll turn round for you.' He said, pulling her legs apart and pulling her bum round so her bum and pussy were on the brink of his mouth before he plunged his tongue deep into her hot wet hole.</p> <p>'Ohhh...' Sally said as her orgasm hit her. She held his head to her as she came.</p> <p>'I'm doing this because....' She started to say as she saw stars as the first wave of white-hot white lava began to shoot into her vagina, as her anus clenched round his finger. She felt him shuddering against her with his own orgasm then as his body collapsed onto hers.</p> <p>'Oh my god! That was incredible.' She said smiling at him. He looked around and caught her eye but didn't speak as he slowly moved his mouth onto her breast and kissed her as he held her.</p> <p>'When we woke up together I knew it had been great, but it wasn't my biggest or most successful one.' He said.</p> <p>'You've never said anything about it before about it?' Her face took on a puzzled look.</p> <p>'No. It was only when it was on my lips. ' he laughed. Her eyes widened.</p> <p>'I've never been kissed like that by a woman, I can't believe you.' She said, but he shook his head and moved a little so his cock was at the mouth of her pussy. He could see her eyes had closed but he was going to fuck it out of her when he felt her fingers pull aside her pussy lips as she began to do a slow deep push. Her thighs clamped down around him as she pulled him closer, moving her hips up a little. She groaned as he entered her, her body moving back and forth in time with their movement. She couldn't hold back so she began to move on his member. He was moaning out loud into her open mouth, he felt himself grow a little more in her cunt as she groaned out. She began to grind her pussy against him in rhythm with their moving. Sally pulled him so close to her that she could feel him pressing at the inside of her thigh as he came. He kept on fucking her until he had no more energy left in him till he collapsed completely on top of her totally drained. He started to suck on her nipples and kiss her neck for what seemed like an age, until all movement stopped. After what seemed like several minutes Sally finally felt him pulling away and moving himself back off her body.</p> <p>'I don't know how I got there in the first place.' He said grinning at the look of terror on her face.</p> <p>'It wasn't like that.' She said, not looking at him. She could feel the blood flowing again into her nipples. It was getting harder to breath.</p> <p>'Oh thank you..' She managed to sayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
