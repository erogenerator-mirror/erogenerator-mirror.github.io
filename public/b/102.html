"You don't have to. It's not like I'm going to come right now. I can take my time and let you have fun." She moved over and sat on his lap, her feet on either side of his hips. "I mean if you want me to stop," she whispered, "I don't mind. Maybe you'll feel better." She turned her head and looked at me.</p> <p>"I wouldn't want you to either," I said. At that moment her foot went to his waist, and her leg slid up his, pulling him towards her pussy. His hands slid round her waist and up under her shirt, cupping her soft breasts through the bra. She pressed into him, moaning softly. His thumb stroked her nipple as his mouth took in her other nipple. His mouth took one breast and then the other in it's mouth, and then slowly worked their way down each side and around her stomach. Her face fell.</p> <p>"You better stop," she told him. "Maybe I'll come," she cried.</p> <p>I didn't hear any of it. I knew what my girlfriend's boyfriend was doing. She had started undulating her pussy against his cock, moving it with her. I was frozen to my place. I wasn't sure what to do. If I said anything, it would be because she'd have stopped and he'd have gone off, and I didn't want that. I wasn't sure, really, where I should be. That might have been the question, but apparently I didn't want to answer it. Or even make an honest choice. I decided I didn't want to have him come. If he had to wait for her to get home, it was worth it. I lifted my head.</p> <p>"Look," I said. "We're supposed to stop."</p> <p>"I'm not stopping," he said, sliding off the chair and into a kneeling position over her. His hands slid down the front of her. He lifted her skirt and her skirt up to her waist, leaving the top of her knickers just above her pussy. Then his fingers slid inside, past her lips, down the inside of her wet slit, and back. Her hips pushed back, forcing his fingers. He stroked her again and again as her hands gripped his head, her breathing getting heavier. Her eyes were closed and she was moaning. I saw in her face she was having the time of her life.</p> <p>His fingers were moving faster now. First one finger, then another. The fingers moved inside quickly, his mouth sucking her wetness into his. Her hips were fucking him back. He put his thumb and forefinger together, stroking in slow circles on her clit. Her body jerked and she moaned louder.</p> <p>"Come," she told him. "Please, give me a second." He pulled away from her. She rolled back.</p> <p>"You'll have to come with me," she told him. "We shouldn't be here. We'll get caught. We shouldn't be going."</p> <p>She reached for his head. He didn't let her pull him back. He held his hands up above his head as if he were going to hold his mouth. The hands moved again. He bent his head and looked up at her. His eyes took her in. She turned on him.</p> <p>"Take me," she whispered. "Please, take me."</p> <p>He nodded. She reached back and put her hand on the back of his head, pressing it into her arse. She pushed his head hard, shoving his mouth onto her.</p> <p>"No..." she shouted.</p> <p>The finger in her pussy was gone. He stood up, keeping his eyes on her as he took off his shirt and pants. His cock was rock hard once he reached her. She turned on him again, pushing him against the wall. His hands found her breasts and he cupped and squeezed them, rolling her nipples between his fingers. She reached her hands down and around his arse, pulling him into her. He was still hard and he gripped her cheeks as they moved together and he pulled her towards them. His hands went back up her back, squeezing her breasts as his tongue pushed into her mouth, their bodies moving together in front of him. Her own hands went back up from his arse, feeling it round his waist. He squeezed them and pulled them together, pushing her against the wall. She felt his hard cock against her and she pushed back against it, her body reacting to the feeling of his hard cock through the thin material of his t-shirt. His mouth left hers and she pulled at him. He pulled out of her mouth.</p> <p>"Don't say no," she said. "Come on. Let's do it, then."</p> <p>She felt him reach behind her and he undid the bra, pulling it away fromâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
