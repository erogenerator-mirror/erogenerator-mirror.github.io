But now that all the action had taken its course I felt like a new woman – I found myself fantasizing about how and when she would take my virginity. I loved her and wanted her to be with me more. I had read, and felt myself aroused again so I turned my attention to the images of her lips pressing harder against his cock - there were plenty of them that I felt were hers, and the contrast of her pale lips and dark hair brought back to me.</p> <p>We didn't notice and the scene that now played out was in front of us. Tim's hands were on my shoulders and he was guiding me away from his hardness, and in a way he was encouraging me to stay there, my pussy still pulsing with heat as the scene played out. It was the part of me that didn't want to leave and I felt the urge to stay. I was just on the brink of a tremendous orgasm when he moved on to the next scene – a girl standing by a pool, but now there was a girl in bathing suit with her hair wet. Her body was covered with little waves of water, showing her age, and then she was pulled up onto a lounge chair near the edge, and then she climbed over the length with her legs on the chairs legs to sit back onto the chair, her bikini bottoms pulled down to just above her knees, and her bare ass pointed at the air. She pushed her hands over her body, and in one move she pulled her bikini bottoms completely over her legs, leaving her thighs completely exposed to the elements. She spread herself as if to offer herself completely to her man, and a string of dark pubic hair formed itself behind her slit, and she leaned back and let the water pour onto her.</p> <p>I was on the edge again - now. A couple of pictures made their way to the top of the magazine and I looked at them – the girl was about to get screwed by some guy, not Tim. Suddenly the scene behind me changed - a group of four guys were standing near the edge of the pool and they were looking at the girl, but she was holding the man's cock in her hand. Her hips were shaking as she slowly rubbed the bulbous end of the man's cock up and down over her slit. Her pussy lips were clearly parted as if she was lubricating, and her tiny clitoris seemed to be throbbing.</p> <p>The picture had been on Tim's mind. While Tracey had been enjoying herself as I had, he had moved to the end of the pool and had begun to kiss her shoulder. She started to move her hand up the man's cock and she rubbed the tip over the top of his shaft. Then she moved to a woman sitting near the pool, and the woman took his cock into her mouth and began to suck him off. There was a clear plastic condom in her hand - one of her boyfriend's, but she quickly slipped between his legs, and then she rolled the rubber down his cock and began to rub it over his body, her fingers teasing and teasing his balls. She was making him so horny standing there looking at the scene.</p> <p>Tracey moved to the other end of the pool again, leaning against Tim's legs as he sat on one of the lounge chairs. Then she lay back in and lifted her legs up and spread them so her pussy was totally open to him.</p> <p>"Do the other girl ever kiss your cock, Tim?" she said, and he just nodded his head. She leaned forward and started to put him in her mouth, just the tip of it disappearing between her lips. Her lips felt so good against his cock as she rubbed it around her lips with her tongue, and then she slid him back into her mouth, but this time with less suction. The sight was one of the nicest I had ever seen, and Tracey began to go at it with renewed gusto, running her tongue up and down his shaft. The tip of Tim's cock was pressed into her lips as if she was sucking him to get the head in and out of her mouth as she got up and down on him. Her saliva was making his cock slick and the tip looked slick and shiny as she moved him in and out of her mouth.</p> <p>The first thing Tim noticed about Tracey was the way that she moved him into and out of her mouth. She was fucking herself up and down on his cock with each upstroke, just her head bobbing up and down as she moved. The first time I'd seen her do that she'd used the tip of her tongue to lick his precum from her lips, but now she was moving back and forth on his shaft with her head in his lap. As she moved she was still holding the base of his cock, but she just moved it a little farther—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
