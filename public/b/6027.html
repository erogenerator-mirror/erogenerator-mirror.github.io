I took it reluctantly and stood up holding my hands out to her.</p> <p>"How did it go?" she asked. I nodded my head. "Now, do you need any cuffs?"</p> <p>Without looking me in the eyes, I walked over, pulled them out of the pockets of my robes, and fastened them on me to her ankles. She let go of my wrists before helping me to put it back in my robe and we walked to the car.</p> <p>"Would you mind getting me back to my hotel room tonight then?" she asked me. I gave her a devilish look before I nodded and she closed the door of the car and got in.</p> <p>~*~*~*~</p> <p>Over the next 2 weeks we went out to dinner, dancing a lot, and generally hanging out. Sara had become very flirtatious. She had given me several peeks at her cleavage in her top and jeans. We had dinner together in the parking lot of her local restaurant and I often gave her a handjob on the ride home. On Friday nights we'd go back to her hotel and party again, but not as much if at all. She always tried to get me to go down on her. She didn't try to be a prude or have me put a cock in her mouth. I would go down on her and suck and then pull back and kiss her tits and eat her pussy.</p> <p>Her husband had turned into such a good lay that he only let us give each other oral pleasure and she usually never came. We'd just sit around the bar and laugh, sip soda and stare at the TV. I still love sucking on Sara's tits, especially when they're covered with fake tanning agents.</p> <p>I loved it when she fucked a few guys in the parking lot behind the club we live in. They always took her home after they dumped her. I was not surprised to learn that their cars were still there. After about another half an hour, she'd come home and walk right up the driveway. I would sit there, feeling like I was going to pass out, but somehow didn't let the pain of betrayal be put to rest.</p> <p>When we got into her house, Sara was making grilled chicken and pasta for dinner. I never really enjoyed cooking that for her. After sitting and staring at her, I finally agreed to go on a cruise to the Bahamas that day. We didn't know how.</p> <p>"I have some business to fill before I go," she said to me. I nodded.</p> <p>"I'll join you in a while." I nodded and turned to go out through the kitchen.</p> <p>By the time I got back she was getting dinner ready and the dishes ready to be piled on the table. We were sitting on a couch when she turned around and started to laugh. I got up off the couch and walked over to her.</p> <p>"What is so funny about this?"</p> <p>"I didn't know you liked it. I'll tell you what this is: I'm going to help you finish dinner. Get off my couch right now" she said as she grabbed my hand and pulled me back over to a chair and sat in it and pulled up her dress.</p> <p>"I think you'll learn a little patience if I do this for you." I stood up and pulled her out of her chair. She pushed me away.</p> <p>"Get undressed! Come on, I know you want to take it all off." I did as she asked.</p> <p>Her pussy was absolutely gorgeous. It was shaved bare, so the hair above it was the only hair my hands could get on it. It was so sexy and exciting it drove me crazy. I had to take it off.</p> <p>I pulled her back into the sofa and laid down on it with legs spread.</p> <p>"Kneel there and get ready to lick me." As soon as she'd turned around I climbed on the couch and knelt there with my face in between her wonderful legs. I began licking her lips with the flat of my tongue. I licked along both sides of her lips, which elicited a little scream from her. She grabbed the back of my head and pulled me even closer to her vagina. I could no longer keep my tongue out of her.</p> <p>"Fuck!" she cried out. "Get off; I can come as long as you want me." My tongue wasn't working so good anymore. The whole time I was going after her lips. I don't remember much more.</p> <p>She came 3 times that evening, the first two just as I was finishing my third. Her legs were trembling, she was breathing fast, her face was a look of complete ecstasy, and in theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
