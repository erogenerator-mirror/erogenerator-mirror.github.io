We paid our check and walked the long way to the car. I was going to say something but instead let out a gasp. Our hands met under the car roof, I looked around and saw a couple of guys outside and two girls up front. They gave me a knowing smile as we walked to the car. I pulled off my sunglasses, leaned over to kiss her and she immediately reached under her dress and caressed my exposed dick. At first it was a friendly embrace but, quickly it became a more forceful, lustful kiss, tongues exploring in each others mouths. It was so good that I almost came right there. As she pulled me away she put her hand on the crotch of my swim trunks and grabbed my rock hard dick. She pulled it hard and looked me right in the eye before pulling the swim trunks down.</p> <p>I lifted up and I started to sit on the trunk of the car. I looked at her and she sat down with me. She was sitting there with my dick in her hand as she took her seat. The look on my face said she knew what I thought she was doing. She reached down and pulled her dress up until it just barely covered her pussy.</p> <p>The whole time we were kissing our hands never went beyond where were touching. I reached up, massaged her breasts through her clothes as we pulled each others' faces closer. I took her mouth in a hungry kiss as I took her ass in my hand and pulled it to the edge of the car. She immediately started to play with my crotch and as I was starting to rub her pussy she pulled away and said "I told you, you aren't allowed to touch me."</p> <p>I started to tell her she didn't need to be asked anything but she quickly stopped. I was shocked by even thinking of that when she started to unbutton her blouse. I could tell she wasn't wearing a bra as the top of her breasts were on full display from below. She undid her belt and zipper before reaching in and pulling her dress down just enough to uncover her breasts again.</p> <p>Once her dress reached the bottom of her thighs my hands went straight to her pussy to feel her wetness. I couldn't stand the frustration anymore and dove my head into her lap. I ran my tongue around her outer lips before probing under so that it got a taste of the wetness she had created as I ate her pussy. My tongue was so hot she was ready for the rough treatment again.</p> <p>I started to slip my finger into her pussy as my tongue licked her pussy lips. In a matter of seconds she was ready to orgasm. She let loose a cry as she came and squeezed my head in a death grip. She started to shake as our bodies got closer to cumming.</p> <p>She collapsed in my arms while I kissed her neck and the nape of her neck. "That was amazing, I needed that." She said.</p> <p>"I've never done anything like it in public before, your not the type to give people head." I said with a grin.</p> <p>I could see the blush in her cheeks and I saw a big smile cross her lips at that. "You can do me any time I want." I told her.</p> <p>"No I can't, it would ruin the mood." I said as I pulled her to me for another kiss. She gave me a weak smile and gave me an encouraging look as she pushed me off. "I've gotta go to work." She said.</p> <p>"Sure, let me know how it went. I'll see you next week then." I said.</p> <p>"Maybe before then. I'm just leaving now. I'll talk to you soon. We have to plan out what we want to do next time." Sam said.</p> <p>"I'll be here if you want me." I said.</p> <p>I looked over and saw her standing still in the lobby still naked and looking around. Her eyes locked onto mine and when she looked away she gave me that look I know all men like to see when their girlfriend is naked outside or just walking back into their apartment. I had to ask, "Do you like women?"</p> <p>She just gave me a wink and walked out the door towards her car. I pulled her to me from behind and started pulling off my swim trunks. I slowly slid my dick into her pussy and felt her hands on my back to hold me still as I started to fuck her in perfect rhythm. She started to moan as she was still wearing a t-shirt and she started to ride me harder.</p> <p>"Mmmm, that's it, that's it, that's the way I love it!" she screamed as she threw her head back and screamed out her orgasm.</p> <p>The last thing I remember is being on top of her before we were both crying. I could have stayedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
