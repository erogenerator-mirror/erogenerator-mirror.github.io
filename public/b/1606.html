Was all I said, with a shrug.</p> <p>"Yeah. I heard some rumors."</p> <p>"Yeah. I don't understand why. What do you mean?"</p> <p>"Well, he told me that it would be fun to go out to dinner with him when we return home tomorrow night. Then one of us would pick up the key and use the cab on the way to our hotel."</p> <p>"We are leaving. When are we going to see her again," I said.</p> <p>"I'm just going to get my key," she said. "I told her I would send her a photo and picture of me tomorrow and give her a message if she wanted to see me again."</p> <p>"No. I have to get back to work. Let's go ahead and check the messages."</p> <p>I looked at her. "I still can't say yes. The woman did mention that one of you may be available tomorrow night," I said, a little sarcastically.</p> <p>She looked at me and said, "I'm sure you won't mind me not seeing you on Friday night."</p> <p>I nodded, then said, "Yeah. I still have a couple of days off. I just wish she'd say, 'You look hot too.' I can't be bothered to take my jacket. My jacket is at the front desk, or in the car."</p> <p>"That would be fun," she said, then got up and picked up her coat, and disappeared through the door.</p> <p>When I went back in, I saw that she said she would email me tomorrow and that she had already sent me a picture with her picture. It was one of her, but it was one she had taken of herself. I was hoping she hadn't sent those again. This was a weird time for her, but she didn't seem to mind it. For the next forty-eight hours, I checked out several times and wondered if there would be a way to reach her, if she would even call. What would she choose to do then? This could easily change our relationship forever. I just hoped that maybe she would just call me or call her mom and say to call her right back.</p> <p>I thought my wife would want to call me. I didn't know how she would react when she saw that picture.</p> <p>After getting my weekend flight back to work, I went back to work and found that the day off the night before was just getting back.</p> <p>"I can't believe I'm going to spend the entire day on a deserted beach again, just like before, when we are home from our honeymoon," I said to myself.</p> <p>After that, the last two weekends went by like this. Friday night I met my wife at an event, and she said yes, she'd like to come out that night. The night before Friday night she came to my house and said yes, she was going out with me. Her mom had also invited her out on Saturday night. I told her we'd be out the next weekend, but not for the week. She said she was not staying out all the time that Saturday, and she'd be in the hospital the next day, and would have to wait until her mom was out to care for her.</p> <p>While I wasn't exactly a happy guy, I had enough money to not have to work. I didn't have to buy the car either, and the only thing that was available for most of the trip was a couple of hotel rooms. They didn't do much work on a trip. I also found the house cheap from my business travel, which was the same thing as I made in my spare time with the sales assistant at the hotel.</p> <p>Saturday I left work early, and walked through the parkway, not noticing the beautiful scenery. I stopped as I was walking, and thought about how much I enjoyed this trip and had found a way to use it to my advantage. I had an idea I needed to do something with the resort. I didn't know whether to be mad or not, because my plans had become sort of surreal in a way. I was still just a regular guy who lived in a resort, and even then I could never be comfortable with a resort.</p> <p>When the resort was over, we went a little shopping, and we went into the hotel right to our room, and started to get ready to go to dinner. After we were ready, we started to have hot sex, when I took time to check my car batteries. My phone started to ring, and I checked it. It was my wife.</p> <p>"Hello."</p> <p>"Hi, it's me, Susan. How are you?" she said.</p> <p>"I'm good.
