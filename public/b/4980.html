I realized that my erection was definitely coming on. It was clearly tenting my shorts and I was certain I could feel it leaking through the leg of my shorts. Her tongue had left saliva-soaked wet lips on my abdomen. A small part of me wondered if it felt as good as his tongue had felt just a short time ago, but I was too caught up, I was so overcome with curiosity, and I was certain this was what it would feel like from another man. And he had brought me to that orgasm so quickly, he might have even been a little faster than me.</p> <p>"That's about your size." He murmured, stroking me with both arms. He kissed the base of my neck and continued to stroke me, his hard cock pressing against my thigh. It was so hard it was going to come out my shorts, and I could not see his hand move across my torso in any direction.</p> <p>"It looks like you liked my tongue, my tongue, I can only hope that it felt as good as it did from this guy's tongue. Did you feel what was going on in my legs from your tongue?" I had a hard time hearing his voice. I did not really like him calling out my name in my ear.</p> <p>"That's definitely the way it feels." Then he chuckled, "but now let's try that more closely, since it is getting a bit slippery by now. I think maybe you would like to find out for yourself." He grabbed both sides of my shorts with both hands and jerked them down until my cock was free. My shorts followed the shorts in front, and then he took them down and off from around my thighs, his face close to my cock. It looked so beautiful, almost as though it could come back at anytime.</p> <p>"If I can get you more comfortable with my cock, I'll let you touch me and play with it."</p> <p>"Really? I'd like you to touch me anywhere." I guess he thought the line was obvious. I put my hands on his cheeks and pulled him closer so that he could begin to lick. His tongue was already exploring my cock, and he was moving his tongue slowly up and down my shaft, running his tongue over the hard ridge of my cockhead and making it twitch under his touch. I could tell my excitement was getting the better of him though. I could feel it in my stomach, in my groin.</p> <p>I lifted his face, putting my hand on his chest. "Don't be nervous, sweetie, all you have to do is show me how you like it." His tongue continued sliding up and down my cock, taking more than half my length in his mouth. I took my hands off his cheeks and put them on his head, pulling him into me.</p> <p>"Suck me, baby. It's OK." I could sense the urgency in his voice and the heat in his body. I kissed him hard and let my tongue dance over his, then moved on. He lifted his face away from mine so that it was looking me in the eyes, the glistening of my saliva glistening in the light. His blue eyes looked at me as he began to slip down toward my erection. I was so turned on by this. So excited, I could not stop myself from pulling him toward me, opening myself to him. I felt his hand on my thigh, and then a warm, wet mouth touching me.</p> <p>The whole situation had turned to something more exciting than I had known, and my breathing quickened. I was so turned on I thought I would lose it then, but the heat between my legs was too great to hold back. I took my hands off his head and reached for his ears. They were covered with his sweat and hair. I pushed them down, and he was on his knees between my legs. I reached out and put my hands on his hips. He lifted his hips, and, as I expected, his cock slipped into my hand. My breathing was ragged, and I could feel the first of waves of pleasure surging through me. He was holding myself against the headboard, which was still sticking up over the edge of the bed. He began to thrust his hips, pulling me into him with each thrust.</p> <p>"Come on," he said. "That feels really good. Here, take a few deep breaths, and enjoy it." His voice was soft, but his voice was sexy. I started to thrust into him, but his motion increased slightly. I could feel my own orgasm building, and it was only fair that it be the same for me. "That's right, sweetie, come for me." He began to kiss me, so I could taste my salty-sweet tongue in hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
