I laid there as his eyes closed again and he began kissing my shoulders.</p> <p>"I have to clean up" he said, taking hold of my shirt and beginning to wipe between shoulder blades. I sat up and turned around to face him and he began caressing my breasts. "That feels nice" he said as he started kneading on them, pinching at my nipples. "Mmmmmmmmm...", I thought to myself. He turned me around and kissed me as he fondled my breasts, then went lower to my belly button, my waist and down to the tip of my cock and slowly sucked on it a little. Once I was hard, he licked me from tip to balls, then back up my dick and slowly deep throated me. After a while, he took his mouth off my balls, and started to tease the shaft with his tongue. Then, he took my cock and started to stroke its length as he played with my balls. It felt great, feeling my cock grow inside his warm mouth. I leaned back on the pillows, so that he could do whatever he wanted. "That's it," he said as he switched to lick and tease the head of my cock "I want it deep in your throat!".</p> <p>I couldn't believe how horny I was as I watched his hands stroke his cock as his mouth covered the head. With his left hand, he was caressing his balls as his right hand slowly circled my cock, then slowly slid inside my pubes. Up and down his hand caressed me, slowly. The feeling of his hand and the sight of his cock inside his hand, his right hand on my balls, it felt like an addiction I couldn't get enough of. He slid his hand up inside me and into my ass as he continued his sucking. His other hand caressed my cock, just the way I like it, when it gets hard. I opened my eyes to see him taking his middle finger and slowly licking the entire length of his finger, then sliding it in my asshole, up and back. I felt the tightness at the edge of my asshole. It felt amazing and his fingers were so nice. My head began to toss back and forth as he slowly slid his finger up and down in my tight hole. Suddenly, my back stiffened as I exploded, cum erupting from my cock, filling his mouth in cum. "That's it" I thought as my body was jerking spasmodically and my cock exploded for everything. My head was spinning as I watched his finger going up my ass, then back down again. I began to cum again and when I was done, he just kept going up and down. After that intense orgasm, I finally rolled over so I could lie on my back and looked at the ceiling.</p> <p>"That was awesome" I said.</p> <p>"Well, it's about time" he said, "I want you to come" as he kissed me again.</p> <p>As we lay there side by side, I looked into his eyes and I told him, "Are you sure this is ok?"</p> <p>"Absolutely" he said, "I have wanted to be with you for so long, I can't imagine how I could ever forget it! I've never been with someone's wife before, it's just always been an issue." "Let's go do it!"</p> <p>As they got dressed, he picked up his pants and pulled his underwear up to cover his cock and me, but I put mine back on so there wouldn't be a wet mark. They left the room, and I headed back to the other rooms to get ready for dinner and to go see my girlfriend.</p> <p>It was 5 o'clock when I got home from our "date". As I walked back to my room, I couldn't help but notice that a very attractive middle aged lady walked across the room. Without checking out the clock, she saw me coming, and got even more excited. I walked over to her and said, "Wow, I didn't expect you home so late!" She said this with a smile and ran toward the kitchen.</p> <p>"Well, I did invite you out for dinner, so I guess I owe you an explanation. You have a good time tonight." We began walking up to her and her eyes roamed up and down my body as she spoke. "I bet you have never been with a woman before."</p> <p>"No, never." I said.</p> <p>"Well, we've never been with someone before" she said "and maybe we can fix that for you, but you should go on ahead then".</p> <p>She took all of this in stride and took my hand, and led me to the bedroom. We laid down on the bed and began kissing again.
