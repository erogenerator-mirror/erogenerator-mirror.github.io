I asked him.</p> <p>He laughed. "It's not your fault. You have a right to be jealous. I don't even know if I like the fact that you want to make my wife happy."</p> <p>"Maybe this is just what the doctor ordered. It's not so I don't like the fact that you're married. Maybe I'm afraid to ask."</p> <p>"I'm on the pill," I said with a laugh. It was the truth. I figured the doctor meant what he said, not anything.</p> <p>"My name is Peter. Peter, my wife's birth control. It's the sex magic," he added with a smile.</p> <p>"Yeah. I know. I've been married to it," I said. It was true. Peter had been faithful and I could sense it. "I just wondered if we might go on a little trip together before we were married," I added.</p> <p>"Yeah. Where?" he asked and I could see he was trying to hide the answer.</p> <p>"Uhm. Well. It was last week, but we didn't."</p> <p>The look on his face was priceless and I felt he was on the verge of tears. "What happened? Did you say anything about last week?" he asked again. I thought he was about to ask me something else.</p> <p>"Peter, I'm just trying to say that I'm not your wife. I don't even realize that my husband knows about us. My parents know, but I don't care. You are the only person on this planet that knows about sex. It's just fun. I don't even know you."</p> <p>"I guess that's true," he replied. "And I'm sorry. It's hard to say. Maybe she wanted me to change the way I was going through things. I don't understand that."</p> <p>I laughed. He seemed totally clueless. I knew it was best to let this go. He didn't know any better and there was no good way to be sure he'd change things. "Besides, you're my boss. What do I even say to your wife?" I asked.</p> <p>"I think," said Peter, "that when we get home we'll make our peace."</p> <p>"Thank you. I can't even imagine what it would be like to say goodbye." It wasn't his fault he'd given me his last name, but I could see how it meant a lot to him. His parents had all been killed by a car bomb. I knew that after all the pain he'd put them through it had made him a better man than them.</p> <p>Peter gave me a hug and we made the short drive to the grocery store. As I was walking toward the store I glanced over at him and there was no doubt in my mind I liked him as much as I thought it did. He was a real good looker. I also saw our new clothes coming at me from inside the store door. I smiled. I'd hoped he'd get a hint of someone that loved me.</p> <p>The next few days went by in a blur. His first trip had been pretty normal. Then he had been spending a lot of time with his friends on a few trips, but he'd left for New York on those two. He had been coming in with his friends every couple of days and I'd been spending all of the time with them. I was on pins and needles until he invited me to go with him on another trip. I had to find a way to let him know that this time was special.</p> <p>By the end of the second week of this relationship we were both single again. We were talking a lot, but I was totally focused on Peter and how I felt about our friendship. We decided to get our stuff together from then on and move away the next weekend. After a few days, we finally started getting back some of the things he did on his trip so that I could be able to get him to tell me anything. I even began spending time with him on weekends, while he had one or two of his friends over for dinner. On that occasion I ended up spending some of my husband's money on pizza and I didn't complain about it. We were really getting along and I enjoyed telling Peter the whole story and getting him to have a good time. His friendship became a lot quieter and we hardly had the time to talk.</p> <p>One afternoon he was in the shower when I walked in to tell him that I was starting to get a headache. He laughed.</p> <p>"Yeah, you're in the shower but you're going to give me a headache," he said.</p> <p>"Yeah," I said as a half smile spread across my face. "I've been walking in there from work after work and I've got this really weird feeling in my stomach that starts in the pit of my stomach and lastsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
