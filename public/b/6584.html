We were not married. We didn't care if we had a child. It was only business. She had to know. But she didn't seem willing to accept our arrangement on account of her marriage and her pregnancy. So, we broke our conversation and I walked her to the door. I turned to her and she turned and looked at me with tear streaked eyes. "Thank you Mark. I really appreciated what you did for us. Please stay with me till we get back to our marriage. We just can't live like this. Please!" I kissed her and we hugged before she went back to the office. As soon as she was out, I headed back down to the office. Before I arrived there, I called in a check to the firm and told them I needed to use their best accounting service. They gave me their name and I would make sure to call the next day.</p> <p>When I got home, I took the kids out for a while so I could unwind. I thought about how we had come to this decision and then it hit me. We would do something that I was sure to never happen again. There wasn't anything I could possibly do to convince her not to go back on our word.</p> <p>On the way back to the house, I told Sandy I needed to take a few more things and take a short nap. As I put my hand on my leg, I thought about how much I had enjoyed the whole thing. I wanted it to never endâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
