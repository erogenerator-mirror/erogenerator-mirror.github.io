My parents were having some trouble with me and I couldn't seem to take it much anymore. There is that one thing about me that just makes me crazy. But, I guess you've got to love me more than you're used to, or you don't have a clue why I'm here. Do you?"</p> <p>"I don't know." Was all I could say. She looked up at me a bit sadly. "But, I can't lie to you again," she said. "This whole relationship has been too crazy. I can't tell you how much I love you, even though I don't know any more about it. Maybe next time, I'll tell you. This might be our night. When do you want to talk?"</p> <p>"I'll be home tonight," I told her. "Will you be here before you get in?"</p> <p>"Of course." She kissed me quickly and left.</p> <p>As I was walking home, I thought the whole thing might have hit a raw nerve. That's when I realized this was a good chance to have a few more nights alone with the sex life I had and maybe even a few good nights. After all, where would I end up? The thought that I might be in for a big night out with my girlfriend had me horny as a rock. I also could tell there was a lot of good at keeping a cool head, so I figured I had better get ready. After all, I had a few more nights to spend with her. As a matter of fact, I was hoping she would make my evening special and I didn't want to do anything to spoil any chance for a good time. I took just enough time to pack the rest of my clothes and my toiletries. I then went to the bathroom and cleaned up the bed while still trying to work at my current form of sleeping. I thought about just going to sleep and falling asleep with it but decided that would be a bad idea, so that I could just lie awake and catch some pretty damn good sleep.</p> <p>It was about 9 o'clock when I heard a sound from the kitchen. I quietly and quickly walked down the hall to the kitchen. Standing in the kitchen, I saw her on her knees. She was naked and was taking my cock in her mouth. Even my dick didn't seem to droop for anything more than a few seconds before she pulled off.</p> <p>"You're early." I joked.</p> <p>She smiled and said, "I know. I hope you enjoyed it. I haven't done it twice that long in my life."</p> <p>"Oh you just sucked on my cock." I was just getting into it.</p> <p>"Yes. I still do and this time was even better." She was smiling now and really getting into her blowjob. With every stroke, she slid up and down my pole. Once she had all of it down her throat, she let it go. She held my cock with one hand, while she jerked the rest of it off using her free hand. I saw the little glint in her eyes as she continued to suck on the head of my cock. I was so excited and ready to cum. As I started to say something, she stopped sucking and said with a smile, "Come over here, Mike."</p> <p>I walked over and stood by her as she wrapped her hand around the base of my cock to aim it at the head. She stopped only for a second and then continued to stroke up and down on it. As I started to move in towards her, I could feel the head at the opening of her pussy. She stopped and looked back at me. "Not ready yet, huh?"</p> <p>"Sure," I said as I slowly approached her. I watched her face intently the whole time as she kept stroking me. We kissed and made out for what seemed like all of several minutes. I then reached down between us and started massaging her pussy. I got a feel of her wetness from the way she kept grabbing my cock. As I touched her pussy, I thought I could feel the warmth in it and thought I was going to cum right there. I started kissing her neck and started to lick and suck on her neck. "Oh yeah," she said softly. "Just like that. Yes, just like that." She pulled her shirt out of her jeans, exposing her beautiful smooth white skin which was still covered by her shirt completely. I reached my hands up and felt her breast as I continued to lick. "Oh my. That feels so good," she said. "Just like that," she said as I moved one hand to massage her clit and the other to continue finger fucking her.</p> <p>As I felt her building towards orgasm, she had pulledâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
