His hands went to her hips and he lifted her as he continued to fuck her mouth.</p> <p>"Oh fuck, I'm about to cum," she yelled.</p> <p>He pulled his head back and released his cum right in that woman's face. She opened her mouth a little and he started to fill it. He kept thrusting, but stopped, but continued to push down her throat as he did so.</p> <p>She came up from her orgasm. She rubbed her body all over his. He finally released her legs, and pushed his hand down and pushed her down on the couch.</p> <p>"My turn," he said to her and crawled up her body.</p> <p>She spread her legs and guided his cock between her lips again. He grabbed her hips and she looked down her body towards his. He bent and kissed her again.</p> <p>"I love the feeling of your lips on me," he said, as if reading her mind.</p> <p>"I bet. Where do you want me to go from here?"</p> <p>"Do you know any place nearby we could go," Chris asked?</p> <p>She shook her head. "No, I'm not interested."</p> <p>"Well that is my choice," he said with a smile.</p> <p>"Chris," she said.</p> <p>She sat up and pulled him to her. He lowered himself down so she was straddling his lap. She grabbed his cock again, pushed the head through her legs and settled down on it.</p> <p>"Oh yeah," he said.</p> <p>"You ready yet," Chris asked, as he lifted her up and down on his cock.</p> <p>She lifted up just a little, so she could go at a normal pace. They fucked hard at first as she went on a diet.</p> <p>"I am ready. It feels so good," she said, as she started to move up and down his cock.</p> <p>She was starting to move very fast again, but didn't have a steady rhythm going.</p> <p>"Let me know when you're ready for round two," Chris said, as he reached down and started to rub her clit.</p> <p>"I am," she said.</p> <p>He pushed his fingers inside her and started to push them in with his cock.</p> <p>"Oh yeah. I'm ready," she said as she went on and on.</p> <p>"Come on," Chris said.</p> <p>She pushed his hand out and leaned back against him. Her arms went around his neck. He pulled her up and down on his cock faster. In just a few more thrusts he let out what was building to an orgasm. She was moaning and screaming now. Just seconds at a time, she would come. She pushed up into him and he exploded on top of her.</p> <p>"Oh yeah, you cum, and I'm nearly there," she yelled.</p> <p>"Not yet. I have another idea," he said.</p> <p>"Now," she said as she got off the couch and climbed across his body. "Let me get my tits done first. I want you to suck on my nipples."</p> <p>He didn't hesitate and started doing his normal thing. He pulled his hand out and wrapped it around her head as he sucked on her right nipple.</p> <p>"Oh god, that feels so good," she said as she felt another orgasm coming in her.</p> <p>She got off to make him wait a minute and then lay on top of him. Her tits were bouncing up and down in her hands and her pussy was getting so wet that some of the juices was running down his shaft. He pushed some of his weight up and got a face in her.</p> <p>"If I can kiss you, can I let you kiss me?" he asked as he got a mouthful.</p> <p>The woman was giggling like a schoolgirl.</p> <p>"Chris, just be gentle. It's not that different than a boyfriend. I've dated some guys that didn't care about me being on top. Besides, they're not really going to do anything. They're going to eat you out or something. They just like being on top as long as it's in control," she said with a giggle.</p> <p>"Well then, I guess I'd better," he said, as he got off her.</p> <p>He quickly pulled the woman up in his arms and carried her into his bedroom. He laid her down on the bed and got naked. He laid down next to her and quickly put a pillow under her head so her shoulders were up. He kissed her and started to caress her. "This is nice, you can have another drink when you're finished with your massage. Now what about my turn," she said as he got onto his knees.</p> <p>She got behind him and started to kiss his chest as he leaned into it.
