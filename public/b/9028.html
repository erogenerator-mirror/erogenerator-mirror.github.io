I couldn't help it, I just had to taste. I had never been the kind of girl who would do anything in the company of a stranger, and I really did want to, so I opened my mouth wide and stuck out my tongue to begin with. I began licking around my mouth, then slipped it into his orifice, feeling a little prickly as well. I slid down his length, taking him in so completely that I could barely fit all of him into my mouth at first, then slowly sliding up again. I took as much as the gag that I could, my cheeks feeling fuller, then the feeling of having him in my mouth began to wash over me very fast. I felt the muscles in my throat start to contract around his long stem and began to gag. He was very surprised that the thing I had in my mouth had yet to be fully retracted, and that had surprised even him, though I had just taken in it fully and felt it pressing against my tongue. As he began to slowly move his tool in and out of my mouth and throat, I realized that the things I had been feeling were much more than that. My pussy was dripping down into my thighs and I was sure he could feel it. I couldn't quite believe it, but my excitement grew as his organ continued to penetrate me. My mouth began to water and I could feel his member growing hotter with each pump, and he began to pump more forcefully. I was gagging with each pump, and his fingers, that had been holding me tightly against him, began to tug at my lips. They felt so nice and strong, and as he thrust into me once more, I felt his seed splash into my stomach. He began to pump away, his lips still holding tight against mine and his tongue thrusting into my mouth. At last, after what seemed very long, he let me go, and I felt relief. As soon as the flow stopped, I looked down and found his organ still twitching, pulsating wildly. I held my tongue to him as he pulled it back and it seemed no longer so large in my mouth. I felt a little proud. My mind raced, trying to figure out what had actually happened. I began to realize that maybe I had not been as good as I thought when I was trying to find a way to tell him I was happy. And, of course, his organ was still there. I started to wonder if I had done a good job. And there was the problem with what had happened with him being here.</p> <p>We laid there, him still inside me, until I realized that my hands were no longer holding my body to him. His hands slipped to my shoulders and slowly began to pull me down, until I lay on top of her. They lay against me until I had no strength left to resist. I tried to think through what had happened in my head, but I couldn't think. It was not the size, yet, and there was no doubt that it had been quite pleasant. I thought. I knew that there had been no doubt that I was going to kiss the man I loved for the rest of my life. I knew, but I was still very afraid. I thought that it was wrong... I knew it was, but it was right. It was my husband's love, not mine. I decided then to tell him. I reached down between us and felt his penis. It had stayed in there so long that it was hard. I started to slide back and forth, trying to get him erect again. I could feel the warmth that had been there for several minutes, and he began to move with me again. I wondered why I had never told him that I was going to wait. Maybe I just wanted to do it now that I was here instead of waiting.</p> <p>When I pulled my mouth from his, I could hear him moan, then gasp. His hands had now left my shoulders and were holding me against him. His face looked down to my breasts and back up to my eyes. He had a look of determination as he began to work his penis more deeply into me. He pumped his hips slowly, his penis seeming larger. As his length began to become very wet, I felt me begin to quiver. I knew then that I was in love with this man. Perhaps it was the lack of a man, or the lack of the strength that held me from pulling back to let him fill me up completely with his own seed, or simply his passion, or something else, or just maybe, it was all just a matter of where he had left off. Then, suddenly, both of us were silent. His face was pressed against me, his hands gripping my shoulders. He held me there while he pumped his organ in and out my vagina, making sure that his own fluids couldâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
