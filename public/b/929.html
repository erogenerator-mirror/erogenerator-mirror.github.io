She moaned and squirmed on his cock, her pussy lips grasping hard at his shaft. He kept his hand gripping her waist, keeping himself up against her breast, keeping her weight still.</p> <p>"Let me fuck you. You better let me or I will come in your mouth. Now kiss me," he instructed. She leaned forward to kiss him, wrapping her arms around his and kissing him back, her tongue flicking against his. She moved her feet on the outside of his thighs and ground her clit against his cock. He had his hands on her waist, pulling her tight against his body. He could feel how wet she was and how tight she was around his cock. She arched back against him, moaning and shoving him back into her pussy. He could feel her body tremble and she began to kiss him even more passionately, her tongue forcing its way into his mouth as she fucked him, her eyes tightly closed. He slid both of his hands free from her waist and moved off the ground, pulling her up with him. She had collapsed as he did, her legs flailing against his body.</p> <p>"That... was amazing." She told him, as she laid against them. He leaned forward and kissed her soft lips gently, stroking her hair and face as she continued to breathe.</p> <p>"Oh wow," he said.</p> <p>"That was really good," she grinned.</p> <p>"Good...because I'm going to take care of you." He kissed her again. She pushed her body against his one last time. "Honey I'm taking care of you."</p> <p>"Mmm," she moaned, her eyes closed and her arms flailing against his sides.</p> <p>"Good, because there's going to be one more thing before we make love."</p> <p>"What's that?"</p> <p>He reached inside his pocket and found a piece of paper, which he handed to her.</p> <p>"That, your last message I received this morning was the same message you left in the mail yesterday, for you to follow. Go now and kiss me." She nodded and walked around the corner of the building. He walked behind her as she walked back, not knowing what was going to happen.</p> <p>When they reached the door his hand was still on her hips, his cock still inside her pussy. He felt how wet she was and how tight she was. It was time that they made love. He had come to realize that she wasn't even aware of his presence until after having come in her pussy, as she had come to realize that it was also time. She was very aware of what he was doing, but he loved her as well.</p> <p>She knocked at the door again and he smiled, opening the door for her. She was naked and beautiful. Her hair was disheveled and her tits looked large and erect. She stood there in a black negligee, her long, toned legs clad in black stockings.</p> <p>"Is this where you want to fuck me and give me a massage every day, lover?"</p> <p>"Yes," he said, kissing her soft skin from her neck to the top of her breast.</p> <p>"Now, open up," she smiled. When she saw his cock she had a smile on her face and she walked right up to him.</p> <p>"Take off the robe." He looked at her as he removed it.</p> <p>"You can have my cock anytime you want," he told her. She nodded, then slid it into her pussy. He looked at her big breasts as he fucked her, his hands working her nipples and his cock thrusting in and out of her. She had one hand in her hair, a hand on the door and it looked like she was rubbing her clit. He was holding her waist and she was pushing against him even more.</p> <p>Suddenly she felt him on top of her again, pinning her under his weight. He pumped and pumped her, using his hand to massage her tits, then taking one nipple between his lips and biting it lightly. She lifted her hips, pressing against him ever so slightly.</p> <p>"That's it. That's it. I haven't been with anyone... you are my first."</p> <p>"Are you?" She asked, her voice coming out husky from arousal.</p> <p>"Yes," he said.</p> <p>They kissed again, his cock still inside her. "My turn to fuck you," he said.</p> <p>"Yes," she responded, pushing her body against him. She lifted her head, her eyes looking into his.</p> <p>Before they could begin he pulled out of her, his cock leaving her pussy. "Now," he told her and she nodded, turning on her side to face himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
