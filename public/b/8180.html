If I'm going to be a part of it, I want something a little more personal."</p> <p>"I agree," I replied, "I think I just want to sit down and listen to your story." He smiled and added, "And talk about it for me. So, where are we going with this? I like hearing about it from a girl who you really are no matter what."</p> <p>"We've talked about this a lot," I leaned against him, "I don't know what happened, but I hope it hasn't changed anything. I've really gotten off on this, and I'm looking forward to it."</p> <p>"Have you been with many guys," he asked. I thought for a minute. I did not want to tell him exactly what I had felt, what I thought was wrong, or if he was interested. I felt like I wanted a lot more for something that I hadn't imagined. But, what should I say? "Do I need to, you know, get married like my mother?"</p> <p>"No, I don't think you do. I have a bit of a hunch it doesn't, but I don't want to lose my wife," he smiled, "and I don't blame you for wanting me to stay here. But, I think you'd be surprised if I really want to become a husband."</p> <p>"I don't know," I said, not sure it was very nice to think and not wanting to admit anything. He smiled and nodded.</p> <p>I told him a little more of what had happened with the other girls and was surprised at just how much I had thought about it. I felt better when I had told him about one of the other girls being in bed with me.</p> <p>"That's good," he said, "so far, you have not done anything to have you think of me as someone you would know well." He looked at me. I had a confused look on my face.</p> <p>He smiled and said, "Have you fucked another guy?" I felt a strange flutter in my stomach, and then a flush in my face. "Yes," I admitted, "But only because I was so scared."</p> <p>"Don't worry," he said. "There's a lot more to this than that." He handed me the envelope that I had left in his office. I took it and opened it.</p> <p>There were several cards in there that he had given me in a different way than I had given him. On each paper were a few other notes, and I thought I could guess the answers to some of them. I began reading one thing, and handed the cards back to him with a blank face.</p> <p>I looked around when I was done. There was a small stack of three-by-fours in front of each man. On the stack was paper and a business card. On the card were my name, I had asked for this job three years ago, and written with just one single line. "I'm John,"</p> <p>On the card it read, "I just left the office this morning." I read it again. "I'm John."</p> <p>I handed him his card, and he read it again. "Yes, you are, and I'm surprised that you have the courage to ask to join us." The card said, "To the one person I love more than my entire life."</p> <p>"You're really beautiful," he said with a smile as he lifted me out of the truck. I kissed him and he was a little shorter than I was, although more muscular. "You didn't hurt our relationship," he began, and then he started to undo my pants. The feel of his hands and fingers on my cock made me jump back. If I was to tell him that I loved him, even if I hated the idea of him doing that, I could hope that it was all just a fantasy.</p> <p>"Don't be mad at me," I said. "Let's just say we're both still virgins, so let me go slow. It's not as much fun as having sex, but I want to feel you deep inside. I want you to understand that your virginity has nothing to do with loving us, although I really do want to see how it might be done."</p> <p>"How would you care if I told you about the other girl with you, or anyone else."</p> <p>"I don't care what you say, I'm not interested in hearing about what was done to or with other girls," he said, "but if you want to know, I'm not sure I want to keep doing this." The way he said, "virgin" made it sound more like "old man" or "nudeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
