He watched her, his hand gently stroking her face, her lips and back in that warm and familiar way. She had soft, thin lips and long blond hair. He ran his fingers along her neck, up to her ear before his finger traced along her jaw and up to her hairline. His fingertips caressed her cheek; he ran his fingers over and around her neck as he moved his other hand from side to front. She was watching him, smiling as she listened to the gentle breeze moving over her face, moving the hair from her eyesight.</p> <p>His finger traced along her jaw to her eyes and the gentle curve of her lips as he leaned forward and brushed her lips with his fingertip; he wanted to see what she's like as he did that. They'd done it so many times, but the last time they did it it was as if he'd known her for years. She watched him as he moved his finger in a slow figure eight motion, touching her with just a brush of his fingertips. His finger traced along her jawline to slowly tease the outer edge, leaving her skin behind.</p> <p>He ran it along that side of her mouth, down to her chin and back up to her lips. He traced her lips with his finger, pulling it down, then tracing down to where it reached her neck and her shoulders. When he reached the base of her chin he traced the line from her neck to her lips and back up to her mouth. He knew this was very erotic for her. She looked into his eyes as they moved down to her cheeks and her eyebrows. She was so beautiful, he was getting aroused just thinking about what it would be like for her to be in his arms.</p> <p>He moved a few steps closer, until they were face to face. He smiled, then bent his head and gently pressed his lips to hers. He'd not intended for the kiss to last very long, but when he felt her respond he didn't stop, wanting to kiss the sweet curve of her lips, the pinkest of them, the very softest toying kiss you could ever hope to have, even though they'd kissed just about every day of their lives.</p> <p>They kissed for what seemed like an eternity, when she broke away. Both breathing heavily, she was his. She wanted to say something, to tell him something. To let him know what she wanted, how she felt, even if it was just a simple thing. But she couldn't. She watched him as he took his hand and placed it over her mouth again.</p> <p>Slowly his head and eyes stayed on hers as he kissed her, running his fingertip along her lip, down her chin, her neck, along her collarbone and chest, leaving her body. He'd seen things in his past that he'd never before even dreamed that they could ever do and he loved it. He had no illusions that he would ever get the chance with her. She was beautiful, she was all he had ever thought about, and she loved him, didn't she? She was the center of his universe, and he was her soulmate. She was his everything.</p> <p>He felt his cock throbbing as he saw her tongue twitch against her lips, then the way her eyes met his. She ran her hands through her hair, pulling the strands together in a knot and watching as she smiled at him. He moved his hands down from her face, running them over her cheek and down her neck, then down to her breasts. He cupped the soft flesh in his hands, feeling their weight and the hardness of her nipples, watching as her breasts jiggled with each breath she took. He leaned forward, dragging his lips over her collarbone to her right breast. He took it into his mouth and felt her jump as his lips surrounded her nipple, his tongue working on the sensitive tip without being sucked. He moved from side to side as he sucked, feeling her breasts sliding between their two bodies and she moaned softly.</p> <p>He moved one hand down into her hair, stroking the silky tendrils, feeling the softness and aching of her, then moved his hand back up her body and down her belly and up onto her left breast. He could feel her breath quickening with his touch and with his other hand he continued stroking herself. She was so wet, it wasn't going to take much. She hadn't touched herself like that in so long. She was so ready. Her skin trembled as his finger teased the tip of her clit and she shuddered involuntarily. He didn't know if she would go that far, but it seemed like she would. She was so horny that she couldn't help herself from rubbing herself in an agonizing fashion, moaning in his ear.</p> <p>He pushed her back down onto the bed, leaving her legs still, and ran the palm ofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
