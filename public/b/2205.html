You went out. I made a few calls and was hoping you would answer the door, like I said." She laughed. "Maybe I should have just let you go. You still have the clothes on."</p> <p>"I'm not dressing for you, I'm in a cab. I was just going to get a cab."</p> <p>"So you did. I could tell!" She laughed.</p> <p>"If you were still naked, I could drive for you right now. But I'm not a very good driver. Where's your car?"</p> <p>"It's too late. Let me get back. I'll call you if I miss a road." She turned around and walked back into her home.</p> <p>Once in her bedroom, she realized that she was still wearing the dress. It was a bit short.</p> <p>To be honest, it wasn't until later that she found out why. At night, she did something she normally wouldn't do, but in the morning, she remembered seeing an envelope with her cell phone. So she called the house and left it in the mail. She was very curious now; it didn't take long before it was all she could think of. She had only one phone.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I mean, I'm...I'm going back," she told him.</p> <p>"It's okay. It doesn't exactly explain why you left your address in the mail, but it does explain it."</p> <p>"Just like my mother did. Did you see it?" She started with a puzzled look.</p> <p>"It's where I have it," it said. "I had it sitting on the shelf in the hallway. When I opened up, I was surprised to see that it has a small, and very delicate, little key. I tried the envelope from the front, but I don't remember anything. I opened it, but it still doesn't come out, unless I put the key in it. I have no idea why it's made out."</p> <p>"You should try it, it's pretty special."</p> <p>"Yeah, maybe. This was all sort of a surprise. But don't worry, it's right here," he said, opening his wallet. "You don't have to open it if you don't want your phone back. I have my driver's license and I have access to the GPS. I don't expect any people to think you know where the house is, and I don't care if they do."</p> <p>"That was nice of you. I'm sure you don't have any idea where that house is."</p> <p>"Well, maybe the keys will come back," he said. As he picked them up from the shelf, he said, "I'm so glad to hear that."</p> <p>She had told him it was too late to change cars. She still didn't have any.</p> <p>"Oh, I hope not," he said with a smile. "Anyway, I guess I'll just walk you through the house. Come on." He took her hand and they walked through the house. It was a very neat and tidy house. The living room was one that she always hated to be in, but didn't dare to look at.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, but I really need to get in the shower to wash off the smell of the house," she said.</p> <p>"That's okay," he said. "I'll just go and put the key in my wallet. It was a little strange though, that it was all my wallet's, and I have a lot of money."</p> <p>"If I help you shower, you'll have to do it for me," she said.</p> <p>"If you are all right, I'd be more than happy to help you," he answered.</p> <p>As he was putting away the dirty towels, she said, "I know you won't be able to get out of your clothes in there, but I need to get my shoes."</p> <p>He laughed. "I don't suppose you'll have to help me in the shower."</p> <p>"I'll just go get my shoes and I'll join you in the bathroom."</p> <p>She took the shoes from him. "They're still in the bedroom. It's a special place that I have. You better get into your clothes," he said as he went out to the hallway. She went into the bathroom, went out the shower and started the water. She stripped her clothes off, then opened the shower door to step in. As she stepped in, she noticed that her panties were still gone. They were gone. She went into the shower, too. She was glad as wellâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
