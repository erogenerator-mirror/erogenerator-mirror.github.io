"Well, I don't know what I would have done if we were to meet him after we ate out last night." Heather was smiling at the thought that they might end up actually fucking before the week was over.</p> <p>"Oh, you're so smart," Scott said with a wide smile.</p> <p>"Yeah," Heather said, "I'm not a virgin."</p> <p>"Well, I'm your first," Scott said. "I've not done it with a guy and it's too early in the cycle."</p> <p>"Well, I'm not really much for anal and that was way back when I was in high school," Heather said with a laugh.</p> <p>Scott leaned forward and kissed Amber lightly on the lips before they broke and said, "I won't tell if you don't."</p> <p>"Sure," Heather said. They kissed again, and she then stepped into Scott's arms from where they were standing. They kissed for a moment and then returned to kissing. Scott felt Heather's breasts mashed against his chest and his semi-erect cock was sandwiched in between Heather's thigh. They kissed long enough to feel each other's naked breasts and the sensation was arousing them both. Heather was breathing rapidly but Scott seemed in control of the situation. As he kissed Heather, Scott realized he had brought this on himself in his own way rather than in hopes they'd end up having sex. His hand went to Heather's ass and he started to finger the opening there. He could feel Heather's clit and she shivered with an initial wave of ecstasy. Heather began to move her hips in response to his touch. Scott moved his mouth up slightly to her jaw and she opened her mouth and kissed him, wrapping an arm around his neck.</p> <p>They kissed for a solid moment and then broke again for air. "I've been wanting to do this for a long time," Heather said. "You don't think we'll want to ruin one of my dates."</p> <p>Scott nodded and pulled Heather into him for another long, wet, and tongue-filled kiss. "I can see that you're still a virgin, but I thought this was a one-time thing and that you wouldn't get upset with me."</p> <p>"No, not at all. I just wondered if I was going to have a really good time tonight," Heather said. "I didn't want to ruin him for once, but if you do this, and if I'll go through with it, I want you to have your first. I'm not saying I'm a big fan of strap-ons but I'm just doing it so it's something we won't have to worry about."</p> <p>Scott kissed Heather again. "Come on, we've got all night, and we'll be back. I'm so hard right now, it could start to hurt."</p> <p>"Oh, is that so?" Heather said with a wry smile. "Are you going to cum?"</p> <p>"Not yet," Scott told her. "Not yet!"</p> <p>"I guess not," Heather said. "This is going to be great, so maybe even some good times. I love your cock and I love your ass too." Heather then turned and ran her hands down Scott's chest, down his stomach, and down his back, stopping mid-thigh and beginning over again at his ass.</p> <p>"I'll bet it is really good already," Scott said with a chuckle.</p> <p>"Mmm, you like my asshole in the morning?" Heather teased.</p> <p>Scott gave a devilish grin back. "It is nice and firm and doesn't give up easily, so I think you'll have a nice time."</p> <p>"I'll just have to keep my ass nice and inviting until we get home," Heather said.</p> <p>"I'm sure you will," Scott laughed. "There's something I want to do to you first." Scott pulled Heather into him and started to kiss and nibble on her tits.</p> <p>"I want you to fuck my pussy," Heather told him. "I need your hard cock in me before I go to sleep tonight. I need your fingers in me." Scott slowly unrolled Heather on her side and then slid her on her back and kissed his way down her body.</p> <p>"What," Scott asked tentatively, "what do you want?"</p> <p>"You know, I've wanted to do this for a long, long time," Heather replied. Scott then pulled Heather's bottom lip into his mouth. He nibbled slowly around the edge until it was moist, but not hard enough to hurt. He then ran his tongue back up to Heather's clit and gently tickled it. He moved down her body, and Heather lifted her legs a little to allow him a little more room. Scott moved his mouth down to theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
