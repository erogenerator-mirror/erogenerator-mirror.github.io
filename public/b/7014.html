I smiled.</p> <p>"What's your deal?" she asked.</p> <p>I grinned.</p> <p>"The only way we go in is if we want the same rights as a client," I told her.</p> <p>I saw her looking at me with that beautiful smile on her lips. Now I realized. I'd had no idea that her friends could do this to her. She looked around seeing if anyone was paying attention.</p> <p>"I can do this. I'll sign the contract and we can start Monday morning," I told her.</p> <p>"That's fantastic. Thank you so much," she said.</p> <p>"What about the partnership with the lawyers," I asked.</p> <p>"They're not part of the business, but I'm looking forward to working with them," she said.</p> <p>"I'm excited about it. Do you have any plans?" I asked.</p> <p>"Well, it's my last stop," she told me.</p> <p>We had lunch together after work on Monday and we both got home at just past noon. I put on a pair of jeans and t-shirt.</p> <p>I pulled out the papers and my accountant came in at that point.</p> <p>I smiled and told him with pride.</p> <p>I called to check the date and the day and the office had agreed to let me move right in that morning.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>I didn't tell anyone we had a special deal on Monday. That was what they agreed to when they got back to their desks. We went over and made a date to get together at my place around noon.</p> <p>The rest of the week was fairly uneventful, with me doing nothing much. Saturday seemed to drag and finally we both got done work by one.</p> <p>"Well," she said after I dropped her off at my house. "That's the last day in your contract."</p> <p>"I'll do it," I told her.</p> <p>I watched her face as she looked at me with that familiar expression on her face.</p> <p>"This means that if I ever file on the end of it, you'll get nothing," she said.</p> <p>"I'm not talking about not being able to show it to the company," I said, trying to give her a friendly smile. "It's me who has the other half of your signature. If we can make the document, it could stay in the past. I can do that."</p> <p>She had an infectious laugh and I felt very comfortable being around this goddess of a woman. I wanted her to feel as though I really was the one. I felt like that was my destiny and hoped it didn't end after all. I loved this new and wonderful experience.</p> <p>Just as I stood waiting for the doorbell ring, I saw it.</p> <p>We were both wearing different colors of jeans. The one and only pair that I was wearing was a pair with a very light tan color. She had on a very nice one that I liked. It was a nice color. My shirt was dark blue with some light blue accents.</p> <p>We stepped toward the front door.</p> <p>"I've had a wonderful week," I told her as we hugged each other.</p> <p>"Well, let's have it in my honor and let your work go to your heart," she said.</p> <p>We took it inside and got on my couch. She sat and watched tv with me as she had done previously. She took the remote out of my hands and clicked a movie. She held the controller against her leg so it looked like a vibrating toy.</p> <p>"Do you miss it?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes," she replied. "It keeps me awake at night."</p> <p>I couldn't do it that much when I was younger, it was very apparent to me that I wanted to do something. Anything.</p> <p>The next scene started. My roommate was giving him a blowjob. He had put the towel between his legs so the towel wrapped up would not interfere with him.</p> <p>"Come on. That's not part of our arrangement," I told her.</p> <p>"I know," she replied. "It's part of my business."</p> <p>"You're the boss," I told her and then smiled. "How come my roommates are so prudish and have a lot of sex?"</p> <p>"They're not prudish. They're very adventurous," she replied.</p> <p>"What do you think of his house?" I asked her. "Isn't there a bed on the backsideâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
