Go on."</p> <p>She lifted her head up as she slid her pussy further up my rod, allowing me deeper down inside her. A moan emanated from both of us as I touched those sensitive places inside her.</p> <p>"Just like that, that's it. Like that."</p> <p>My hands were on her waist, my fingers curled around the small of her back.</p> <p>"Is this what you want, baby? Do you want me to fuck your pussy? Tell me that your pussy wants me to fuck your cunt. Say it."</p> <p>"Oh yes."</p> <p>She let me feel her tight channel wrap around my pole. She pulled her legs up as high as she could and arched her back, giving me a good angle, her hands on the wall. I reached up and found her perfect breasts, kneading them like dough. "C'mon, baby, fuck me."</p> <p>It was just what she was going for. I felt my climax building, I felt my prick pulsing inside her, feeling her pussy grip my prick as if it were a fist.</p> <p>"I'm cumming, I'm cumming, I'm cumming . . ."</p> <p>I tried not to think too much, only to feel a rush. There was a warm rush of air against my groin and the sound of squishy fuck-me sounds filling the dorm room. She pressed her mouth against mine, her tongue probing my lips and dancing with mine. I felt the first twinge of pain through my shaft, but it quickly disappeared when she sucked on my mouth.</p> <p>"Are you ready, baby?"</p> <p>"Yes. I want you."</p> <p>I held her as she pushed us back against the desk.</p> <p>"I'm ready. I'm ready. You fill me up as I go crazy."</p> <p>We kissed and kissed and kissed just as we had done so many times before. It was passionate and loving, more tender than anything I had done before. It would be no different with me though. Our bodies pressed together, but not our mouths, it had a different kind of kiss. It wasn't like the oral that our tongues and kisses had shared. This was a woman holding my cock with both hands, her mouth open and her tongue busy as it swirled around my tongue like it was a pussy. I felt her nipples pressing against the barest touch.</p> <p>"How do you like doing this?" she breathed.</p> <p>"It's wonderful. The best oral I've felt in a long time. I never knew that I had feelings as sexual as they were right now."</p> <p>She pulled her lips from mine and lowered down, kissing me. While we kissed, our bodies pressed toward each other as if there were a mind that it had a mind like yours and mine. Our bodies ground together and rocked against each other as if we had been made for each other.</p> <p>Suddenly there was a flash of fire, like a fire in my abdomen. The rush, a sense of anticipation. She opened her mouth and the pressure of her tongue against mine increased.</p> <p>"I am not having you now."</p> <p>"I'm not having you, sweetheart, I'm not having you when you are not ready."</p> <p>"How can you be ready."</p> <p>"You're ready."</p> <p>We both laughed. She leaned back and smiled at me.</p> <p>"I'm going to need more than one kiss before I do you."</p> <p>"Are you on the pill?"</p> <p>"Yes. I have used condoms a lot."</p> <p>"That was pretty sexy too."</p> <p>She laughed again, looking in my eyes and then up to the mirror. I followed suit and we kissed again.</p> <p>"You are so beautiful, Baby. I want to hold you in my arms forever."</p> <p>"You're not ready yet. You should not worry about what happens if you don't want to."</p> <p>"That's fine."</p> <p>My cock began to rise as I looked at her. I had no idea how to say this, but she looked so much more desirable in a short time. She was slender, like she used to. Her body was beautiful and sleek, with a softness to it that you find in a woman of more moderate size. Her arms were wide, her hands and fingers were strong, like a woman's. She was beautiful. She looked at me intently.</p> <p>"Do you have someone?"</p> <p>"Would you like to have a threesome with a woman?"</p> <p>My mind raced. She wanted to be a threesome as much as I did.</p> <p>"No," she said. "Please let me.
