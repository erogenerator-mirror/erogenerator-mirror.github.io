I sat down next to her and kissed her cheek.</p> <p>"I'm glad you called me. I haven't been able to look at you the same. The first time I saw you last week, it was just a weird dream, but as you have said, dreams seem to come true," I said, kissing her ear.</p> <p>"So will you still do that for me? For us?" she said, smiling and looking me in the eye.</p> <p>"I can't believe what I've done to you. I'm just about to take my time and explore the mind and body that you are."</p> <p>She kissed me full on the lips again and I could feel her hard nipples against my chest, and I could feel the softness of her body through her t-shirt.</p> <p>"No, that's too long, if you don't mind I do. How long have we known each other?" she asked as she continued kissing me, pushing her tongue into my mouth.</p> <p>"Not long ... it's actually been way too long."</p> <p>She squeezed my erection through my trousers and started to stroke it through my trousers. She undid the buckle of my trousers and let go of my hand and I could feel her small breasts under the shirt. For a moment I thought I had lost my mind, and then I felt her tongue run up and down my chest, over my nipples and down to the waist of my trousers, where she undid the fly and then slid her pants down over my erection.</p> <p>Her tongue worked its way lower and lower to the small patch of hair that comprised my erection, and I could feel that a familiar swelling in my pants.</p> <p>'Oh, god, that's the sight of two people doing all that!' I thought to myself as I heard the familiar sounds of fingers on skin, nails biting into the surface under my trousers.</p> <p>"What the hell am I thinking, I mean what of it? Don't want to wake Dave up?"</p> <p>She looked up at me with a half smile and said, "You can look for yourself."</p> <p>"I'd better go," I said quickly and got up.</p> <p>"I really am so sorry, you two have been so wonderful, but this has to end and I know I can't have any fun with our friendship."</p> <p>I turned and headed for the door, leaving her there in the hall.</p> <p>"Do you have any time," I asked.</p> <p>"Not really," she said.</p> <p>I went down stairs to the kitchen and put the kettle on, and when the cup was gone I walked to the top of the small stairwell. The whole time I took my time. I just had time to look in the lounge and see if there was anything else, but I was not sure. My heart was racing. My prick was sticking straight up. I couldn't take my eyes off the sight before me. I must have put the cup down for a minute or two because I heard a noise behind me that sounded like the front door opened.</p> <p>"Who the hell is that?" I said in surprise.</p> <p>"Oh, hi Dave," she said, "I hope I've not disturbed you."</p> <p>I turned around, and saw that I was really surprised. She was standing in the doorway looking very much like you would expect to see. She was shorter than me and her eyes were wide-open, but she was very very pretty and I could see her hard nipples pressing straight out the front of her shirt. I could see what was happening behind the sofa. She was standing directly behind me. If I had looked up at her face, I would have seen her eyes, but I couldn't, because I thought I would be recognised. I walked closer, to the front door, and my heart nearly stopped. I could not let that happen.</p> <p>"Hello?" I said, "Hi, Dave. How are you, um, you're looking forward to our meeting? I can't believe how lovely you are looking this morning."</p> <p>"I have a friend in the city and she was just a colleague of mine," she said, "Who is she?"</p> <p>All this time I was standing there watching her from just a few metres away. She could not have been exactly 10 years older than me when I had first seen her.</p> <p>"I'm sorry to break the first of your heart and be as quick as I can about it. But my friend's a professional, and a very sexy lady. It's a lovely thing to have the chance to get out of Sydney," I said, and then I said.</p> <p>"I know. I think I just did.
