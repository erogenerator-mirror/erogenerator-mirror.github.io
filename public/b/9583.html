I had never been so turned on in my life. I reached up and started running my fingers through his dark brown hair. My lips traced down his chin, across his collar bone and down to his hard stomach.</p> <p>I leaned down and ran my tongue under his chin, then under his neck. He shivered and moaned a bit as I ran my tongue across his lips. I could feel the pre-cum forming on the tip of his cock. I wanted him right then. I slowly drew my tongue out and up the side of his neck and slowly down the other side.</p> <p>"Please," I whispered in his ear.</p> <p>I pushed him down on his bed as I took my robe off and threw it on the floor. My t-shirt was over my head, and had slid down over my breasts as I lay on the bed.</p> <p>My legs were spread wide and my fingers trailed along the smooth, toned flesh of my thigh. I moved my fingers back and forth, just on either side of my clit so that my fingers could rub across the swollen nub. I moaned and bit my lip. I watched his face as he watched me. The look in his eyes was pure bliss. I felt like a goddess. I started working his cock with my fingers. He groaned as I ran circles over the head. He grabbed my fingers and ran them through his pubic hair. We both smiled but I watched his face just as intently.</p> <p>"You can use me if you want, Baby," I whispered in his ear.</p> <p>He just shook his head no, a bit disappointed, but he just wanted to play with my body. I started rubbing the head while pressing my fingers against my thighs as he moaned and writhed on the bed.</p> <p>My eyes had never left his face. He leaned down and kissed my cheek. I could feel his breath rasping across my skin. His tongue licked my ear as I slowly jacked him, feeling his hand stroke my body in sync with his lips. I loved every second of it. I felt his head move over my shoulder as he lowered his face to my breasts. We watched each other as he sucked one of my nipples into his mouth.</p> <p>"Yessss," I hissed as his teeth closed over a nipple.</p> <p>I ran his hand down my flat stomach to my clit. I felt his finger slide through the tiny folds of bare flesh, teasingly teasing across my clit. "Yes," I hissed.</p> <p>I closed my eyes and let my head fall back. I could feel his hand inching toward me, his finger pressing against my clit as I moved my hips forward and back against his finger. He teased my clit lightly, running his finger around my lips and gently inside my body. He slid a finger inside my pussy, then another and another until he had four fingers deep inside me.</p> <p>I moaned into his ear as his other hand came down and began to caress my clit. He continued his movements, making circles around my nipple, as I rode with his fingers. I loved how it made me feel. It had been so long since I had been touched like this. It was the only thing that could pleasure me. The pleasure I felt when his fingers brushed my clit.</p> <p>He slid his fingers out of me, holding my thigh and placing a finger on each side. He slid in and out of me, coating his fingers. "Lay down," he ordered.</p> <p>I sat on the bed with my back against his chest. He leaned down with his chin on my shoulder and he took his fingers and wrapped his hands around my ankles. I spread my legs as I felt him take my calves and lift my legs up and over his shoulders. His cock came up and pressed against my pussy. It was hot and thick as he placed the head just inside me. I loved feeling the tip go inside of me and it made me feel like I belonged there.</p> <p>He slowly pushed his cock back into me, moving slowly at first and then getting more frantic and harder in response to each thrust. He slowly slid all the way out until just the tip of his head was in. Then he slid all the way in again and again. Our pace quickened as we got faster. He pushed me forward until my ass was against the headboard and his hand was wrapped around my hips.</p> <p>"You feel so good, Baby," he said between breathless moans.</p> <p>I couldn't agree more. I was in heaven. I couldn't feel the friction of his manhood against my pussy, but he pushed into me harder and harder, his eyes locked on mine as the pleasure grew in us both.</p> <p>I moved my body against him, trying to control his paceâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
