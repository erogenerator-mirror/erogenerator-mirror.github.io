"She's as cool as she looks...and a little wild...she'll go all-o-ood at the drop of a hat."</p> <p>"I know she is!"</p> <p>"You know she was," Sarah said again. "I have no doubt."</p> <p>We all laughed. And then everyone asked all kinds of questions about Sarah, about this and that, but Emily was the one who broke the silence first.</p> <p>"Well, she didn't have one of her husband's 'old women' as she calls her."</p> <p>"My husband's a woman." Emily said. "You guys just have to remember that. I don't know about you guys, but I'd say her was just as hot and bothered as I am when I'm all-o. And she still does...well, except on me, but not in the bedroom...and just like me, she doesn't have any of that in her. But, she seems to be a lot more fun to be around, and she's probably going to keep making that room for herself after she's done, too."</p> <p>"No, you're not," I said.</p> <p>"No, really," Sarah said. "She's just a wonderful lay."</p> <p>"Really, she is," Emily said. "Maybe she did, or maybe she just thought I was some weirdo. It's a long story, you know."</p> <p>"Yeah, she's good if she makes it fun," I said. "Besides, I might ask her to stay naked with me if she gets cold."</p> <p>"Well, it's not like I have a wet mouth in the winter, any more than I have on the day of your birthday." Sarah finished and then I caught her eye.</p> <p>"So you and Emily, are, uh..."</p> <p>"It's a secret," Emily said. "The rest of us keep it."</p> <p>"Uh...that's not how you see it, is it?" I asked.</p> <p>"No," Sarah said. "It's kind of a little more obvious, though. They're not going to go to a movie, like we are."</p> <p>"I'll go," Sarah said.</p> <p>"I'm not sure if they want to," I said, "but it might have an effect."</p> <p>"Maybe, but probably not," Emily said. "They'll think it's weird for me to have that."</p> <p>"So maybe if you ask her," Sarah said. "Maybe...let's find out. She's been great for you."</p> <p>"Good luck with it," Emily said as we left the pool in a daze. It was a really cool, almost surreal experience, but we all got along just fine. We had a great birthday though.</p> <p>-</p> <p>As we were leaving I was sitting there in a chair on one of the lounges, wondering if maybe things were still going to be weird between us when Emily opened the door and stepped out onto the patio.</p> <p>"Hi guys," she said. "I thought maybe I could get my hair done for breakfast?"</p> <p>"You're not wearing it?" I asked.</p> <p>"Nope," she said. "That would be a shame."</p> <p>"Oh, you'll look fantastic," I said and suddenly she and Sarah were all over talking about how Sarah had just gone through a pretty messy phase, and how they really shouldn't be saying stuff like that all the time, but I was still so glad and relieved to have them out there talking about something for my birthday.</p> <p>We walked along the pool path and came to a small, one-story, house. As we neared the front door I saw a guy standing there. When we pulled out, I saw he was one of the guys from the pool party that I had once worked for, and when we reached the front door and entered through, he was standing in the kitchen.</p> <p>"Hi, Sarah," I said to her as I shook her hand.</p> <p>"Hi, John," she said. "I thought our paths would cross at some point, but we are just getting over a little, aren't we?"</p> <p>"So are you a woman?" I asked.</p> <p>Sarah looked at me and laughed. "No, not really. It was always this old woman thing, though. We didn't really know it was going to be this good before. When I was in college I was just dating some one, mostly, but when my husband got involved with one of the guys who was the senior partner in mine, he was sort of my third girlfriend." She hesitated and I took her hand then she smiled at me and added, "But Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
