"Do you want to hear a secret, or are you going to let me tell you any more of my sexual escapades, or is there more?</p> <p>"Well, there was no more, not before you married me."</p> <p>"A little while ago this would have been a big deal, but you didn't."</p> <p>"Well, when my ex-boyfriend told me he had a thing for my breasts, I guess I figured it out and he found out I liked it."</p> <p>"I should probably tell you," he said. "One year after you moved up here and I was married to Mike, I decided I wanted to start trying. It was one of the most exciting nights of my life. Mike seemed so happy having you there, and then my ex-boyfriend told me that you were a bit older and we had a big fight for a few hours. He said you were the only one that was really close with her. As soon as I left you he asked if the other guys had been like that. I just told him no, which seemed like the first time. I did not want to seem too much of anorexic."</p> <p>"I didn't exactly say that Mike had a girlfriend, but you knew this guy so well, you didn't have to worry about it. Anyway, I decided I had to tell you a bit too. I got my ring off the night you had to go to work," I said, "and I was sure going to tell you about it right now. I just couldn't keep the excitement out of my voice."</p> <p>He looked at me with tears in his eyes and then nodded to himself.</p> <p>"What's the matter?" he asked hopefully. "I didn't want you to know any more of your secret than we really did. What if I told you a bit about myself, but that would be too much too soon?"</p> <p>"I guess so, you know I can give you details about my life for the rest of the day and night if you want," I laughed.</p> <p>"I am not very excited after this conversation because I guess I wanted to know more than I had to about what really transpired in your last two weeks."</p> <p>"I guess you have made my fantasy a very, very good one so far," I said, as I stood up and walked to him to hug him tightly.</p> <p>"We aren't going to be getting that done tonight, are we?" he asked with a grin plastered over his face. His eyes scanned my well-toned body up and down in every part of me. I know he felt something akin to lust and desire coursing through him as he pressed himself against me. Somehow that brought a level of possessiveness to his body as well. "So, how did it go for the first few weeks?" I asked as I pulled myself off of him and sat down beside him.</p> <p>"Well, it sort of snowballed, and the sex came around after you left last week. Anyway, when I went to pick up your car at a gas station you said that you had something to teach me so I could go to class," he said. I nodded.</p> <p>"Well, in that case," he said, reaching out and giving me a soft kiss, "I'm glad your family is visiting someplace this weekend and I don't feel like I have a chance to show you how much I appreciate your hospitality." I looked down at my feet.</p> <p>"Honey, it's not only your family that appreciates your hospitality but also the fact that you helped us get over the first time we moved in together over 20 years ago. I'm glad your folks are safe and your parents are safe."</p> <p>He hugged me again, and then looked up into my eyes. "I don't want to be in a place where I don't have to get out of school every day and spend the next two weeks with a young woman with the most beautiful hair I have ever seen, and then have her leave a day early."</p> <p>"We also have to learn to share everything about ourselves in order to make it a normal life."</p> <p>"I guess I am just the guy for the job," I grinned. I could hardly wait until he was able to do me all over again!</p> <p>I sat in his armsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
