The man smiled as he continued the massage, his hand never leaving his work, only rising up to keep pace, his other hand cupping her head to hold with his own. They moved to the bed, he lay down behind Lisa's waist and lifted her hips until she was fully on her hands and knees. He knelt beside her and continued to massage her back, the sheet falling to the ground, leaving her completely exposed.</p> <p>She felt his hands spread the globes of her ass and begin to knead, feeling her muscles moving in response. She felt his hands caressing her cheeks as his fingertips pushed the lips apart. His calloused finger slipped inside, pushing against her, searching for her sphincter. He began to rub it in large circles and Lisa screamed with pleasure. He worked his finger farther in and as he drew it back to the tip, it began to push, stretching the tight sphincter as he pressed against it. Lisa was sure the stranger could feel her body, she moaned loudly from behind the veil of her hair, as she pushed that finger in again.</p> <p>He continued the massage, his hands moving back up to her breasts, her ass now in the air and his fingers kneading the soft flesh. He was gentle as he pushed and pulled his finger in and out, his other hand still pulling on her flesh. His hand rubbed circles on the folds of her sex, moving slowly across the sensitive flesh. Lisa shuddered as the tip of his finger dipped into her as he continued to work it into her ass.</p> <p>The finger was still wet as it slipped inside, his other hand finding her clit, rubbing it as his finger plunged in and out of her ass. He continued to watch as his finger penetrated and withdrew, Lisa still screaming as the man's finger danced in her pussy. Once fully in he began to rub her ass, then spread the cheeks as her whole body quivered with excitement. Lisa's screams grew louder as she felt her own arousal begin to build and the finger began to work in and out of her ass, his finger working her hard clit.</p> <p>Lisa pushed harder against the stranger, trying to match the pace of his finger as it pushed in and her own orgasm grew. She was shocked when the finger began to withdraw, never stopping the rhythm with which she began to cum. His middle finger plunged in and out, moving from her clit to her entrance, the finger twisting inside of Lisa, his hand pressing and rubbing against her lips. His fingers continued their assault of Lisa's sex as she exploded into the most intense orgasm she'd ever experienced. Her body writhed under his weight, his fingers sliding in and out of her ass as she continued to climax. Her head swam with desire as her body shook and turned before him.</p> <p>Her screams grew louder, their movements urgent. She finally slumped forward, both hands moving to the stranger's head, her fingers playing along his hair, and she whispered to him, "I am your wife. I don't care how you feel. This is what I have wanted for so long. It is what you wanted and would have never let me know it was possible. I am your Master."</p> <p>With that she felt his cock pressing into her body. She felt him throb then his cock entered her, stretching the soft flesh with his throbbing member. Her own wetness caused his cock to slip easily into her body as his hand reached up to her breasts, squeezing them gently as much as they could with each stroke. They kissed as her body continued to shake and quiver under his hands. He slid his cock in and out of her body, his hand pinching and rubbing her nipples. Lisa reached between her legs to her own hand, rubbing on his cock. He continued to pump her as she moved his hand to her mouth to taste herself on his fingers. He pushed his fingers into her mouth, sucking gently as his hand rubbed over her breasts. Both of them seemed to come alive at the same moment.</p> <p>They moaned into the kiss as his cock slipped from her body and he knelt on all fours beside Lisa. She had to reach her hand back to hold on, her pussy on fire for more. He smiled as he looked at Lisa as she reached back to hold his cock. His cock slowly slid out until it was just below her pussy as Lisa reached back again to hold it at its base. His fingers were still wrapped in her hair as she rubbed the head up and down the lips of her pussy, then back down. His hands remained in her hair as her fingers continued to stroke his cock.</p> <p>She lowered her head, her mouth opening before his cock, as she lowered her head so that the tip of his cock lay next to his own lips. He smiled at her, his hand pushing her head down a little asâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
