He reached out and wrapped his arm around her shoulders. She had never felt closer to her own daughter. Tristan placed his hand over hers. "You're welcome to stop by anytime you get out of this building."</p> <p>"I could use my own car." Tristan said.</p> <p>"Good," Tristan said. "Because if you're in the car, I can park you there."</p> <p>"I can't. Why?"</p> <p>"Because if I stop by later today, maybe you can see for yourself."</p> <p>Tristan smiled, and stepped back a pace. "That's fine, I can use you."</p> <p>Tristan placed his hand over hers and looked her up and down. She gave him that "I'm out of my room now" look. Tristan smiled again and let his hand drop. "I love you."</p> <p>As he turned off of the street, Tristan looked out his window and saw a taxi waiting on the pavement. He turned back and followed the cab for a few moments until he spotted his car parked in front of his house. He quickly walked up to the driver's window to let him know that he was there. Tristan walked up and leaned over beside a smiling Tran.</p> <p>"Thank you!"</p> <p>"For what?" Tristan asked.</p> <p>"For having been there for me."</p> <p>"Oh you're not just thanking me, you're thanking yourself."</p> <p>Tristan nodded. "I am, but this is so nice."</p> <p>Tristan reached behind him and got the clasp on his jacket before Tristan could get in his car. As he started out of the parking lot of his house, he noticed that he hadn't looked in any mirrors. His eyes seemed to be focusing on the road ahead of him as he made his way around the front of the house and through the garage. Tristan then parked and jumped out of the car. He walked toward his house. As he opened the door to his bedroom, he noticed his mother's car parked out front. He walked in the door and leaned in as he heard a light knock come through the door.</p> <p>"Do you live here or is it your own?" Tristan walked to the door to see his mother and father both standing before him wearing very short skirts. Both were naked. Tristan's father sat down on his chair and Tristan sat down on it too. "Mam, please forgive me and I am sorry that I have embarrassed you. I thought it would be easier to get rid of you." Tristan looked down at his erection and walked over. "No harm done," he said softly. "I'm not your father."</p> <p>Tristan smiled. "Yes I know. I was your sister. Do you really believe I would have been more comfortable with you than your father."</p> <p>"No," Tristan said. "I think you were right. I was just wondering how it would be different. You're both beautiful."</p> <p>"Are you sure? How is it that you didn't hear me in the night?"</p> <p>"I was asleep in the living room. Is that okay?" Tristan and his mother both looked up at the door.</p> <p>"I can live with that." Tristan replied. "Would you mind if I took a shower?"</p> <p>"Of course not. I want you in here." Tristan replied. "Would you please lock up."</p> <p>The door closed behind him and Tristan's mother was standing in the middle of the room. She was wearing a sheer see-through gown of red satin. She held a couple of towels up and was leaning over him with one hand as she placed wet hairpins over his nipples. Tristan sat up and watched her work the lathering up. Her nipples were so hard that they hurt from the constant rubbing. When her fingers reached over to untie his shoes, Tristan reached up to grab both.</p> <p>"Don't," she begged. "Don't."</p> <p>"Please honey."</p> <p>Tristan kissed her lips and felt her resistance melt away. He had taken his own top off earlier as a favor. His mother had stripped naked before him, and he had seen all her body. He wanted to see more of it. He stepped back and moved toward her. His hard prick slipped between her thighs as he watched them open slightly. He wrapped his arms under her arms and lifted her off of her feet. As his mouth took hers in his own, he felt herself opening to him. He slowly kissed his way down her neck, until he reached the top of her breast. His hand ran up the back of her thigh before slipping his fingers into the leg of her panties. As the panties moved away from her pussy lips, he felt his hand touch her clitoris for the first timeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
