I don't know if the subject was anything more complicated to him then I thought, but he seemed very curious.</p> <p>"He's said he might be able to... if they can get a contract for it," I said nervously. I could see that my words were a little overblown. I wasn't comfortable telling the truth, but I was sure that the man wasn't going to be too happy with it.</p> <p>"You're not taking the chance on him," he said gently. "He's a good person. I know that he's got a little crush on you, and he doesn't mind the way things look from across the street."</p> <p>I hesitated. I hadn't really considered that. I decided against it. I had a good feeling that if I told him that I liked him, he'd understand. He might even be willing to make a deal for me to let him see what kind of things he could get me out of my pants, so to speak.</p> <p>"I know it's probably a lot to take in for the asking," I said, "but I'd appreciate it if he's happy for us."</p> <p>The man smiled, and then gave me a friendly shove. He grabbed the car, and then ran around my side to open the back. My heart beat with a sudden rush of fear.</p> <p>I started to turn around, but he stopped me by picking up the phone. He picked up once as I backed up into the shop. It seemed like several seconds before he handed it to me.</p> <p>"Hello?" he said.</p> <p>"Hey, what's up?" I asked.</p> <p>"It was my dad's idea," he said. He handed me the phone, and then waited for me to turn around.</p> <p>"How will I tell you what to do?" I said.</p> <p>"I'm a photographer," he said. "I just like to take pictures, as a hobby, so I thought I'd come fix it on the phone," he explained.</p> <p>"No, that can't be," I said. "I don't like to take pictures when there are people in the shop and you can't see through it."</p> <p>He thought about it for a moment.</p> <p>"Do what?" he asked. "Can you find a way to do it?" he continued.</p> <p>"I can't," I replied. I guess he'd figured that out, and had been working on the idea. I gave him my name and told him that I could, or would, do that if he'd let me. He thanked me for offering, and I could hear the disappointment in his voice.</p> <p>"What kind of photography do you do?" he asked.</p> <p>"Nothing special," I said. "I just get the idea that it's not for a photographer, that it can be done from anywhere in the world. My dad said that I could use a lot of my time working with my eyes. It would be fun." I had a sudden idea.</p> <p>"A lot of talent," he said. "Let's start there."</p> <p>I went out to the corner of the shop and picked up the phone. Within seconds I brought it down on the man's shoulder.</p> <p>"Hello?" I said, my voice rising and going up with the speed of a man in a hurry.</p> <p>"Hiiiiiii," the man said. "That'll be good." The voice sounded like it could be from his office or the phone.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I said as I set the phone aside.</p> <p>"I know," the man said. "I just came back for something important, but I've got to be back sometime for dinner and stuff." His voice broke like a tear in his eye.</p> <p>"I understand," I said. "It's fine, you're here. Go right ahead." I waited.</p> <p>"Yeah, I just wanted to say 'hi.'"</p> <p>"It's alright," I said. "But you said you'd be right back for more when you got here."</p> <p>He looked at me again. His expression was kind. I saw that he was looking between my legs. I looked down at my outfit, seeing how the skirt was riding up my thigh. I looked at him, and saw that he was staring.</p> <p>"You'd like to?" I asked in a soft, teasing voice. I had intended to keep it professional. The thought pleased me. "You wanna have me?" I added.</p> <p>He smiled. I felt so warm that I could hardly breathe. His smile was different, more loving. As he spoke I could tell that he was speaking to himself. I think that he was trying to figure out whatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
