I've been to my mother's home and the other women in the house as well. And now..." said the doctor as he stopped pacing. "I'm going to need to come to you about your daughter being sick. The doctor suggested that I come with you. I've been feeling ill. And this is going to keep me from having the baby before you find out."</p> <p>"Wait. That didn't happen." The doctor interrupted, looking toward the bathroom. "The only hospital on my planet that could afford to give me a room for a month. That place was built in the late 1800's. I'm sorry, but you can't give me any rooms with you."</p> <p>Tanya nodded and looked back at her mother. She smiled weakly. "I'm going to go with you. I'm so sorry."</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>"My mother is coming with me."</p> <p>A moment later, I heard the bathroom door open and my sister stepped inside, tears stinging against her eyes.</p> <p>"We're going to be okay, aren't we?" said Tina.</p> <p>"Yes, we are."</p> <p>"Do you think that my sister is crazy?"</p> <p>"Maybe it is. But why go do it if you don't want any part of it?"</p> <p>Tina held up her arms and ran her hands over her cheeks. "I don't care if it's wrong." Then she looked back at me. "Do I know her mother?"</p> <p>"I don't know."</p> <p>"I don't either."</p> <p>I reached out and stroked her cheek and she smiled up at me. "I'll take good care of her, okay?"</p> <p>Tina nodded. She stepped toward us, a slight pang in her voice. "I hope that mommy wasn't such a bitch."</p> <p>"Do you really think it would change my mind? Would I think any differently?"</p> <p>"We'll see."</p> <p>Tina glanced across our family and saw that my sister was looking back at her, tears still streaking down the sides of her face. She reached out and took my sister by the hands. Tina held them, holding them to her face for a little while before she turned to me. "Is, you okay?" She asked, stroking my hand.</p> <p>"I'm okay." I looked at her. "I'm going to be in the hospital for six months. I didn't want to think about what your father was like as a baby, but I do know what it did to you and what to expect. You can go back to making me take your bed."</p> <p>Tina smiled at that. "Okay." She nodded, looking slightly ashamed.</p> <p>"Let's go. The doctor is in the bathroom. We'll take some of the food I brought with me if you're hungry and get some food down at the hospital."</p> <p>Tina and I headed to the kitchen, carrying our bags of food. We didn't have to make a lot of food since Tanya was already in the hospital. I walked with her and we found some leftover Chinese takeout in the center of the floor. The refrigerator and the freezer were filled with things Tanya would have been afraid to open. I dug out a couple of cans of beans and the rest I set in the fridge.</p> <p>"What's on the left now?" asked Tanya as we sat at the kitchen table.</p> <p>"Nothing."</p> <p>"I'm going to miss you guys. I'm going to miss eating with you and mom."</p> <p>We both waved at Tina. She grinned at our efforts. "I can't wait," she said. She smiled to match my smile.</p> <p>Tanya looked at me. "You guys still hungry?"</p> <p>We ate and cleaned up outside, but the doctor looked at us suspiciously and asked us if we planned to go back to her father's house for six months as well. Tina looked at me, wondering what I would say. I grinned back at her.</p> <p>"I told her no. She just wants to see you."</p> <p>"I understand that."</p> <p>"Please, Tanya. She wants you to come back to her. Can you do that?"</p> <p>Tanya nodded enthusiastically. "But I've never had a mother and father, and I never talked to one."</p> <p>"Of course you have."</p> <p>"But..." she said, but stopped when she realized what I had in mind.</p> <p>I stood, pulling Tina with me. "No, no. It's okay. It's okay to have someone else take all of your stuff back here. That can't be helped. Especially since your father is in the hospital."</p> <p>Tanya's eyes widened, understanding suddenly forming.
