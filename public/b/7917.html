I was suddenly aware of how I was feeling, as my mind struggled to understand how I had imagined this gorgeous creature as the night before.</p> <p>We were walking towards the car while she tried hard not to stare at me with lustful eyes while talking to me. I could feel how my cock, now fully hard inside my trousers, started aching in time with the blood coursing through my body, as it throbbed and throbbed. I could feel it pressing against me and rubbing against my shirt as we went through the drive. I could feel my blood still throbbing, as if it were a steel rod that was in time with the throbbing in my penis.</p> <p>Suddenly, I stopped, turned around and asked to wait outside as she walked out my front door. But as she entered before me, I had a sudden panic.</p> <p>"No," I said with panic and excitement.</p> <p>What did I just say? "No," she said with a laugh, "but I can't go another day without feeling what it's like. Can you imagine that, with no one else around?" She laughed.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," was my reply, "I think I can."</p> <p>She grabbed my hand and we went in my car, which was still parked in the garage. "Now just drive carefully, because I want something," she said, smiling.</p> <p>I couldn't get my mind off the beautiful and sensual woman walking around me, which was still hidden inside her tight little dress.</p> <p>"Here, have you got your key?" she asked again after I unlocked the door and walked in.</p> <p>"Yes," I said, trying to look the part of my girlfriend, whom we both knew by now, and who had been at the gym with the other girls. "How does that sound, Miss?"</p> <p>"Very good," she smiled, "I think this looks very nice." She looked inside my car, which I could barely see through my head. She looked a lot too, in her deep blue top, which showed her fabulous breasts quite nicely below, and in her short skirt, as it was getting late in the day.</p> <p>I quickly had the car unlocked and on, and we drove away leaving the young man behind. She turned around to look at me.</p> <p>"That was an incredible performance, Chris," she said with a smile, looking down at my crotch which was still trying to pump itself in her tight little dress. "Now hurry up and get me that bottle of vodka I bought earlier." She said. "I don't drink too much, don't I, Chris?"</p> <p>I shook my head nervously.</p> <p>She looked at me with a smile again, and said "No, you look a bit pale, Chris."</p> <p>"Yeah," I replied, "I don't really drink much, but I must admit, I'm not the sort of girl who could be a little too young for you, Miss?"</p> <p>"Don't be silly, Chris," she smiled again, and stood up, turning around towards me. I was again stunned by her beauty.</p> <p>She had on a tight, very thin, light top which showed off her very nice breasts, and a tight short skirt that showed off the cleavage she had. She looked so fucking hot, I almost felt a shiver go up my spine. She turned back round towards me, and I could see her lovely, big smile again. "Now, I'm sure I look a bit overdressed," she said, looking right into my eyes, while her pretty blue eyes twinkled at me. "And a little bit of beer's a bit against the rules, that's why it's only for the girls at the gym, isn't it?"</p> <p>I laughed, although I really did have to admit she was pretty good looking to begin with. "Yes, Miss," I said, "but you're not the real Miss here."</p> <p>"That's alright," she said, giving me a little wave, then looked around again. "There is one more thing to do before we go back to your place," she said. "Have you been thinking about this place many times?," she asked, "I wouldn't know how you do that while you're so distracted, don't you think it's rather inappropriate?"</p> <p>"You mean," I said, thinking that we were being too honest, "that even though I was thinking about something that I'd really like to be able to help you."</p> <p>"Hah, no," she chuckled, "that isn't all."</p> <p>"Oh no, Miss," I said, trying to calm my excitement. "We really mustn't do anything, Missâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
