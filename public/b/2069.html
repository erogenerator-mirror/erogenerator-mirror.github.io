My heart beats erratically and I could feel my stomach rumble as I heard a female voice yell "Fuck me!" I knew that was my only female voice at home, but I couldn't hold back any longer. I stood and unzipped my pants and yanked my cock out.</p> <p>"Fuck, I gotta stop this or I'll cum in my pants..." I heard a voice say. I didn't dare turn around and I was shocked how excited it made me to see a woman like those two women... I thought to myself what the hell? I was just a spectator. I didn't know women. I was still trying to process all the events of that morning.</p> <p>"Hey." a woman's voice started. I didn't look up.</p> <p>"Yeah?" It was not a woman's voice.</p> <p>"Look I know this won't bother you or what your doing here, but how about a shower? I'm ready to go. Could we talk?"</p> <p>"Sure honey, let me grab my jacket." I looked up and I wasn't sure what to make of her. She looked good. She definitely had a lot on her body and I could tell she knew how to use it.</p> <p>We headed up to her apartment and I knocked on the door. I could hear the shower running in the background, "hello." I answered. Her voice was definitely a bit rough and she smelled of sweat. I could feel the hairs on my arm move and it reminded me of her.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, is this bothering you?" I didn't know how to answer. "Let me get you a robe so you can go home? I'm sorry if you're upset. I don't know what I do for a living."</p> <p>"Thank you." I said softly, knowing that I didn't really want to talk but I didn't trust myself to ask. I could feel my cock stiffening once more.</p> <p>"Well, I don't know what this is all about." She said calmly, "and I would never want anything to harm you..."</p> <p>"I just couldn't believe the people in your building..." I felt her eyes staring at my cock.</p> <p>"Please? You have nothing to worry about. My wife is here too, I have a shower and your privacy's not a problem." She turned her eyes back to me. Without another word, she grabbed her clothes, shut off the shower and left the bathroom. I was now in shock.</p> <p>I felt a strange kind of relief.</p> <p>"Okay, I'll tell her" I thought to myself.</p> <p>There was one large part of my mind that couldn't understand what she had just told me. It was so strange and yet my cock was once again raging with excitement. I was about to make some decisions, but I just had to figure out how to tell her. "Wait, if she wants to." I thought to myself. I didn't know where that would lead.</p> <p>I walked back to my desk and sat down. I wanted a glass of milk and some aspirin, but she wouldn't hear it. I had a horrible time getting up in the middle of the afternoon trying to calm down. I think I might have been getting a lot of sleep last night.</p> <p>"So, uh, what have you been doing?" I asked her as I sat staring at her in her apartment. She could see it in my face and it made me very uncomfortable... What would she think of me if she knew what she must have been looking at... I knew I should keep an open mind and talk to her, but I couldn't.</p> <p>"I didn't like what just happened." She said it very casually, but it was like she knew the answer and that she wanted to know how it happened.</p> <p>"What?" I looked her straight in the eyes and I think I looked a little shocked.</p> <p>"I'm... I can't explain why..." I looked back down and she got an evil look in her eye.</p> <p>"Please don't tell anyone," I begged "Just let me finish and I'll come home when I'm done with all of this. I will tell you in person if you want."</p> <p>I sat there waiting for her answer. I can't explain it. But the moment I saw her eyes again, it made a sudden chill run up my spine and I felt something else in my stomach. Anger. Whatever it was, it seemed to be taking a stronger hold on me. I didn't know how I felt but I decided to make the worst decisions of my life and let her have some fun. So I closed my eyes and I said to myself, "I'm sorry. I don't want to hurt you, but please don't tell anyone. I promise I will do whatever you ask. I hope what happened doesn'tâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
