They were, indeed, just as well-endowed as I was; all three were in their early forties and all of them had a lovely figure. My wife was, in truth, much better of a body than she was in those days, as all her years in the gym hadn't kept her in shape enough to make her even more attractive to the two new guys. I was always happy to take any of the men's money and they didn't seem to mind. I thought of it as some kind of initiation ceremony at a bachelor party where the guys get to have their choice of a girl to sleep with. I hadn't ever tried it (or ever hoped to) but after a couple of years I had a hard time not fantasizing about it. Now, all I had to do was pretend that this was my life.</p> <p>Sitting next to Bill, Bill asked, "So, is this about what happens on Tuesday?"</p> <p>Saying nothing, I nodded and replied that I was willing to try it if it turned out to be a good experience.</p> <p>Bill was a little nervous about what to do with me now. After all the men in attendance, Bill had just made an entrance on a very private and intimate day. As I said earlier, he wasn't looking directly at me and I could tell that his shyness might have been showing. He nodded slowly and said, "I certainly hope so." His next comment was "My wife and I would be so honored if you ever decided to accept our little deal." I think he wanted to say, "I've told you before", but no words would come. I was so glad that they both accepted it because my mind was swimming with the possibilities for how this was going to go. My hands were trembling somewhat and his had a nervous look in his eyes as he nodded. Bill smiled a little and said, "I know you have your wedding ring, so I am guessing it doesn't really matter."</p> <p>Feeling so much better about my decision, and so glad I had made the right decision, I turned to Bill and he quickly asked the same question. The big question was in his eyes. He wanted to know if he got one.</p> <p>We both gave the same answer, "We can't."</p> <p>He said, "It was never intended to be an act, so my wife and I were going to take something special from something that was special to her."</p> <p>"Yes it has to be special. This is not so much special as it is a celebration with a special purpose. A special purpose that will be fulfilled for both of us in a special way."</p> <p>Bill looked at my wife and thought, "She will be really happy for me." I mean Bill and I have known each other less than two days, but our relationship now was very similar. I hadn't even known my wife had been sexually active until we had gotten married. Bill had told me that he wanted to experience sex with another woman from time to time, but I couldn't have cared less for our relationship. For me it was Bill's fantasy, not mine and it was Bill's to be my own and I could never do it with anyone else but him.</p> <p>Bill stood up and began to unbuckle his pants; all the time looking me up and down. Bill's cock looked impressive and that made my own body react in a sexual way. A part of me liked the control that the old Bill had over me so I was happy about it. To have someone else looking at me as my slut wife was turning me on like that I had never imagined. As Bill continued removing his slacks, I wondered how many men would have wanted more of my wife's body. I had to admit that a lot of that had to do with watching my wife's body and what it meant for my own future. I wondered if Bill was seeing a future for me as the one he desired.</p> <p>After he had shed his clothes, Bill walked over to me and put his arms around me and kissed me. The first kiss I'd gotten from him. It was a sensuous one, and I was becoming instantly hard.</p> <p>When he pulled away from me I said, "Wait a second Bill." I stood up and bent to kiss him a second time. Bill pulled me into him and I pulled his face to mine and I gave him a hot tongue probing kiss. I put my hands on the back of his head and pulled my mouth slightly away, "I won't be the only one to enjoy your mouth tonight, Bill." He had stopped kissing me and was breathing heavily as Bill began to unbuckle my pants. His hands were moving slowly over my body. He began to unbutton my shirt and I knew he was getting a little nervous about that because before I could get my pants off, his cock wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
