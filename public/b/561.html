I never knew when I'd come home, but suddenly I feel like I'm going in a different direction every time I think of you," she whispered.</p> <p>"If you are, you won't leave here without a lot of explanations."</p> <p>"I didn't mean, you know, to leave without all that love you make."</p> <p>"I know but sometimes things that you're too busy doing can affect you. I don't know what it is though. I might just be getting to know you better when you go home."</p> <p>"I'm so sorry, but the moment I leave here I'm going to get even angrier than I am. I've just met you and I don't know what's going to happen. I don't know what kind of friendship you think you have, but to just leave here and never see you again. That's the last thing I thought you'd say. I can't take it anymore. I feel like I'm losing everything."</p> <p>A minute passed before she finally sat up. "It'll all be taken care of, I love you too. If our friendship ends then we'll take it easy for the rest of the year.</p> <p>She stood up and kissed her lips. "It sure will be better now."</p> <p>She looked back at his face and saw sadness. She quickly stood up and walked back to her room to change to go to her dorm. She knew that she was only going to have one more night like that. She walked back down the hall and to her room while she turned the lights back on.</p> <p></p> <p>Chapter 3:</p> <p></p> <p>Eric came out of his bed with a smile on his face. "That was beautiful," he said as he flopped onto the bed.</p> <p>She looked a little surprised but took off her clothes. "What do we do now?" she asked while stroking her nipples with her finger.</p> <p>"I don't know. Where do we go from here?" he answered.</p> <p>"Do you know what night would be so far away that we aren't in any danger?" She asked as she straddled him. He looked at her with a confused look. "Do you have any idea what's ahead in my new life?"</p> <p>"It's something the two of you do in your heads," she giggled. "It's like the two of you are already one thing, in your own universe. You've always seemed to be on the varsity team."</p> <p>Eric just nodded and reached up to play with her breasts. Her nipples were already rock hard. While he continued to rub her breasts, he slid his hand between her legs.</p> <p>"Not much is going on with your life," he said. "At least I don't think so. You'll be doing college all by yourself but we only need one month and then you have to decide how to start the rest of your life again."</p> <p>"No, we can work on that. I'll give you an example," she said as she leaned forward and slid her pussy down on his cock. He slid into her slowly.</p> <p>A few minutes later she was moaning and grinding her hips into his. Eric began thrusting into her. He loved the feel of her pussy on his cock. He knew they would be in every bedroom again. Maybe he could even sleep in the same room. After all, the only thing that mattered was pleasing her. He was going to have all night to make her feel better so she wasn't going to complain.</p> <p>The two of them continued to rock her world in a constant state of arousal. He could feel her clit pressing against his pubic bone when he would thrust deep into her. Her breasts were bouncing up and down as he rammed into her. Finally he could feel her climax approaching. He began thrusting harder and faster. It was time to cum. He felt himself almost as close as she was. He watched his cock vanish as he thrust it into her. It's time. He felt her pussy clench around it as she came.</p> <p>Once he felt her orgasm subsiding he rolled her over and lifted her so that she was flat on her back. "I think we have to take a quick shower," he said.</p> <p></p> <p>Chapter 4:</p> <p></p> <p>The next morning Eric was woken up by the sounds of running water in the bathroom. "What time is it?" he asked as he got up.</p> <p>"Just time for the shower," she said.</p> <p>Eric was excited by the prospect of showering with her this morning. He didn't know her so well, but she looked good enough to eat. He looked up as he started to go down the hall to use the bathroom. He turned and headed down the hall to take a shower when he remembered she was going to stay the night.</p> <p>He opened the doorâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
