I was scared. I wasn't sure what to do or even if I wanted to be. But what I couldn't seem to make myself understand was myself. What was wrong with me? What could be wrong with what my husband did for me.</p> <p>My husband... I said to myself, what am I doing with him? I didn't feel what I felt at first. I don't know if it was the fact that I had just given my life, or if I was just tired of it, but at that moment I felt deeply and profoundly lonely. Not only would I not know that I was what I was becoming but maybe he would want to be with me again. Maybe even he might even like me as much as I liked being with him. Maybe it would be okay.</p> <p>It would be okay.</p> <p>Maybe even good.</p> <p>I couldn't decide if I wanted to be this way with Rob and go with Jake like I usually did. I wondered what he would think of me. What I might do.</p> <p>But my emotions were in turmoil. I couldn't decide.</p> <p>I could also't decide if I wanted to be with Rob and go to sleep with him again and I didn't know what to feel about our marriage. The last feeling I had was sadness. There is so much emotion in that.</p> <p>It was going on all through dinner. When we got to bed the next evening I had a strange, mixed feeling in the pit of my stomach. I felt the guilt for losing someone I loved. But as I got deeper into the dark, I knew I didn't want to lose Rob. I was too happy to lose anyone.</p> <p>The next day I made up my mind and decided I would go see Rob and see what I had missed the past two days. I told Amy I needed to get a grip and just concentrate on work and what I wanted to do. I thought I could handle that. I was beginning to understand what I was missing and even if it wasn't real life it would be okay, and it was okay with me and I would be happy. In some ways I guess it was okay. It would not be the best experience of my life after that and then when things got too crazy there was still the possibility that maybe it wasn't real.</p> <p>That night I went to the party alone. I told the girls I wouldn't be back before seven o'clock and we would go to dinner out later, but it really would be the right thing for me to do. I figured that would make me a little more comfortable, and it would be nice instead of feeling like a complete asshole and wanting to hang out with Rob and some friends instead of going to sleep with Jake. I just hoped things would work out okay and I could see how it made me feel in the beginning.</p> <p>It was after midnight when I got back. I cleaned up the room and started the dishwasher. I couldn't wait to give Jake a real kiss and then tell him what an awesome husband he was, and how great of a friend he made. But I just couldn't get the idea of what happened with Rob being in bed with my husband out of my head. I had to be honest with myself and even though I felt like I had failed it wasn't too bad. I was so in love with Jake and the more I thought about it the more I didn't understand it so I was going to have to do a quick retreat to the bathroom before I went back to bed too late.</p> <p>As I got ready to give up the room for the night I realized a certain part of me wanted to get Jake to bed. It wasn't really a bad thing if he got more into it than I would have imagined. I had never cheated on my husband and I didn't think I would be doing that. Still I thought about it and thought of Jake. Maybe if I really started to enjoy myself... maybe there even was a chance I might even go through with it.</p> <p>I knew I wouldn't be doing it as some big, silly fantasy like I'd promised Rob. But I would have to try. At least, some day. For now it was time to think about what Rob wanted to happen that day.</p> <p>*********</p> <p>On Thursday I had to get ready for work. The trip had been long and it was important since the start of the next week. The more time I worked on the home front the more I actually enjoyed what I was doing and that was more than just the kitchen cleaning, it was more just the cooking. And it was an opportunity to actually talk with Rob about the coming week and what the job seemed like.</p> <p>I got ready early and decided that since it was the next day I would call Jake and see if I could work out a long-term thing and maybe ask himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
