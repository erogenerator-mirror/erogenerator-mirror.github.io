I couldn't wait to sleep again. I quickly found the key to my computer and opened it, which made me feel warm and relaxed. Then I hit 'Enter' and the lights came on. My eyes began to well up, so I quickly typed the 'Enter' command to turn off the lights and see if I could get into bed.</p> <p>The light in my room was all of the lights. I quickly put all of my clothes on and checked my watch. That brought me back to the present situation. I had only two hours before I was to go back to the apartment and to my bed. My heart raced as I walked quickly to my bedroom. I quickly took off all of my clothes. I could feel my heart beat in my ears while I lay on the bed. I closed my eyes and put my arms over my head, knowing I would have to face the consequences. In the corner was a large wooden chair sitting facing the doorway. I looked out at the corner and saw that I was right.</p> <p>"You left this chair here. This chair has a hook in it that I can attach to the wall."</p> <p>The chair was a large metal bed that was straight with wood sills. The table was a low slung metal chair that looked so comfortable. The room had the curtains on it closed. I looked at my ceiling and saw that I only had a night bed. The room seemed to be very comfortable.</p> <p>I saw the bed was a single king sized bed. It looked very soft and very comfortable. The bed had a deep V to the left and a V to the right. There was no other apparent point. What was really going on was that I had been sleeping in the chair. I lay there for what seemed like forever when all of a sudden, I heard the door open and the light on the bed came on. I opened my eyes and saw a naked man walking towards the bed.</p> <p>'What the hell?" I thought to myself. He paused in the doorway and looked back at me. He had a funny look on his face and it seemed as if he tried to control his breathing. A look of surprise flashed across his face, but he did not turn or look away. His eyes never left mine. I felt myself start to tremble. I felt so helpless with myself in that moment. He took a step forward into the room. He was not a man. He was a muscular large man, maybe six feet in his shoes, and he was in his early 50's to early 60's. He also had dark blond hair that looked like it was pulled back into a pony tail. He had brown eyes that I never saw before. He had a strong jaw and a nose that reminded me of some kind of a small apple. He had a firm nose with small ears. I looked around the room for a minute, but there was nothing.</p> <p>'This man, I mean he look just like my husband." I thought to myself. He must have realized I was looking at him and knew that he had seen me looking at him.</p> <p>He held out his hand and I took it. "David Williams, sorry if I disturbed you but don't worry." He said with a warm smile.</p> <p>"Please, come in." I said nervously.</p> <p>He looked at him and I could see that he looked upset at the whole situation. I thought to myself what a wonderful man he is. He just stood there, as I felt all of my worries come crashing down on me. He pulled me towards him and kissed me deeply on the lips. I responded with my arms around him. He responded by wrapping our arms to my sides. He lowered me to the bed as he quickly undid his shirt and tossed it aside. There he lay next to me as I closed my eyes. He looked at me for a moment and then moved in closer to me. He held his hand to my cheek and brushed it away. Then he pressed his thumb lightly to my lips. "I won't bite until you tell me it's okay." His hand pulled away and I opened my eyes to see him just looking at me. "You look so beautiful." he said.</p> <p>I blushed, but nodded slowly. I closed my eyes and enjoyed the feeling at first. I felt so vulnerable and so loved. I couldn't believe I was allowing that man to look at me like that! He pulled me back towards him and pulled the blankets off of my body. He threw them on the floor and then covered himself with the blanket. He reached down to my waist and pulled me toward him. He turned me around on my back and pushed me so that my head was resting on a pillow right in front of his face. He kissed my forehead and then kissed my cheek. He then kissed my lips and lips.
