You're just saying that, right?" he asked.</p> <p>"No, that's not what I mean. What I mean is that I like you. What I mean is that I was hoping that we could get together, but have the time to ourselves. We're both 18 - maybe 19 now now! We're both single - so if we're ever married we'll never look back!"</p> <p>"I think you're right! It was never in your wildest dreams what you'd do if you were going out - to an all out date! But that wasn't the kind of relationship that I wanted you to have right off of the bat!"</p> <p>I looked into my father's eyes with a sudden determination; something I never thought I'd get tired of seeing.</p> <p>"What do you mean you were willing to throw away your life for me...in a way? You have no idea! I can't!" I said, but it was just an attempt to reassure him.</p> <p>"No, that's not it at all, sweetie. I'm a good Catholic girl and that means I can always say yes."</p> <p>That took me by complete surprise. I wasn't even sure how I felt about it...I was always just looking for some outlet to get away from the life I'd kept hidden from my father because of some kinky and perverse way that he'd treated me. I was pretty certain that he would have been angry by this admission and we'd have made a deal; but he was not going to let it end, so long as it was an open one.</p> <p>"I would take a month off and you have some sort of contract," he said. "A contract between you and me. We'll get together - just a quickie."</p> <p>"I don't know - can't we - why?" I said, trying to get him to change his mind.</p> <p>"Because we can't, honey. If we really go to college I'll be able to find a decent job in the area."</p> <p>"Oh - really? Is there a market for that?" I said. "How can I say no to you in that kind of situation?"</p> <p>"That's not really what I meant," he said. "It's just that-"</p> <p>"Dad," I interrupted, "I'm very serious. I think we should talk about this later, if you're free today."</p> <p>"Sure," he said, "I'm up for another hour or so."</p> <p>I got out the food and went back to get dressed. It was a little after 11PM, so I hadn't eaten yet, so I had to get to sleep before I left for college. I got in my car and headed for home. The more I talked with my father the more I worried about what he might have in mind for me when he got there later that night. I thought he might have changed the mood by getting me in bed early.</p> <p>I was about to get in my nightgown when I heard my car start in the driveway. It was 7:30PM, and I could hear the radio being started up again. I decided I needed to get out to the living room and get some fresh air before heading to college.</p> <p>After I made myself some lunch, I was ready to take my dad into the bedroom and talk about what he had planned for me. I knew he would probably try to seduce me after dinner when I got out of bed, and he likely would have to do that before the night was out. I also knew that he would probably tell me to go home and wait by the front door as he prepared and prepared himself for me, and maybe later - after he got out of the car and closed the door.</p> <p>When I went into the bedroom, I stripped off my clothes as I undressed; nothing special going on; just a routine I knew better for this. It didn't take long before my dress came off and I was standing in my bra, panties, and panties before I even got the hang of my bra. It was as sexy as I'd imagined it would be. I felt a little ridiculous wearing both, but I was already a little turned on by the turn of events with my new found sexuality.</p> <p>I took off the bra and panties and then stood there in front of the bed with only my panties on. I still had my underthings on so I was feeling pretty self-conscious in looking like I was trying to seduce my father. I was sure I was going to see him at least, but I figured that was probably the case.</p> <p>I went to the door as he closed the bedroom door. I looked closely and saw that he had put a towel over the bed when he closed the door. I was in the center of the bed and hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
