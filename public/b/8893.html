I had to admit I was surprised at how long he was. It was like a long thick pencil in my hand. It had to be at least 5 inches flaccid and hard.</p> <p>"Come on, babe. Show me what you have," I pleaded.</p> <p>I could tell he didn’t need to be asked twice and quickly unzipped my jeans, reached into my purse and extracted my cock. I quickly stroked myself as my husband watched in awe as I had one woman in my hand sucking my husband's cock... and then my balls.</p> <p>"Oh yeah," he stuttered. "She is so beautiful. God, she's incredible. I'm gonna cum in her mouth."</p> <p></p> <p>I took his cock out of my mouth and told him to lay on his back while I got on top of him. I slid on top of him and then slowly pressed my cock against him, getting it ready as I sat on his stomach. I lowered myself on him until his cock felt the tight ring of my ass. I eased myself on top of him and slid down his massive cock to the hilt in one slow, smooth movement. My stomach and arms contracted as his rigid cock impaled me completely.</p> <p>"Oh my God. It's so big. Don’t you dare fucking move a muscle or else you'll hurt yourself," I warned him.</p> <p></p> <p>"You ready?"</p> <p>"Yessssss," I gasped. "Come here."</p> <p>As I stood up, I grabbed his hand, pulled him up to a sitting position, and then spun around. I slowly backed him onto his back and then positioned my cock-head on his chest. I took his shoulders and helped him to roll out of the bed. His chest was heaving as he gasped in awe. I turned his body over and positioned myself on top of his face. He grabbed me and pulled me down as he tried to pull me onto his mouth. I slid on the bed with him and he quickly found his hands on my ass and I spread my legs in response. We wrestled as I began to work my way toward his mouth once more.</p> <p>"Don't you dare touch me there!" I warned him.</p> <p>"I'll do whatever you want," he replied.</p> <p>He didn't wait. He grabbed my ass and spread it open and slid down and began to explore. He was soon sucking on my balls and working them in his mouth. One hand firmly planted on my ass, his tongue slid in and out of my hole as he lightly probed my asshole with one hand. His probing fingers were soon in contact with his tongue until I had to tell him to stop. I pulled his head away from me then rolled of over, straddled him and impaled myself on his cock. I bounced on him, pulling my hair to keep from making any sort of noise as he continued to suck and lick my balls hungrily.</p> <p>"It just feels so good I don't even fucking care if he hears me. Fuck me. Fuck me harder!" I screamed.</p> <p>I was quickly getting close to climax and was about to warn him when he slid his thumb in and held his cock there as I erupted on him. My body was rocking as spasms rippled through me at the contact with his cock and his tongue. He continued to lick me as my pussy contracted around him for a few moments, then slid from his mouth and laid down beside me.</p> <p>"Oh my God," I moaned. "That was incredible."</p> <p>I smiled at him as he rubbed his face into the hair at his end.</p> <p>"Damn, you are one great fuck."</p> <p>"As is yours," I agreed.</p> <p>We slept until the wee hours. When dawn broke, I told him he needed to shave and leave the bed. I had told him there was a bathroom that we would use. That's right, I called the place and asked for a spare shower. I got him into the shower, took off my bra and panties, and stepped into his. I pulled him close and washed him off while we talked about the morning. We talked about the two of us and about the two of us. We kept talking, but I could tell he really enjoyed being with his wife. I felt like I was in love with her. My heart soared at the thought.</p> <p>We ended the conversation with kissing on the lips for some more, but then he took a shower. I showered with him and then, following his directions, I shaved his legs. He enjoyed shaving me as much as I did. I enjoyed shaving him too. The sensation was amazing as I shaved him and his cock was also getting a little harder. I was soon washing him every thing. As the water hit my legs, I—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
