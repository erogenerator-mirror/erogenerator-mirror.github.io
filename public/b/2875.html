She pulled back, her lips pursed into a big smile. I took a good look at my baby, my baby, my woman.</p> <p>I told her "We can't do it here, let's go."</p> <p>She nodded and reluctantly nodded. We got ourselves dressed and left the hotel. On the way we stopped in the bar for a beer; the first two I gave and one for her.</p> <p>The second one I gave her and got her a soda.</p> <p>Once safely on the way we stopped for a light snack. As the drink was starting to loosen my tongue I took her hand and started to kiss it, sucking on the top. Then I sucked on her thumb.</p> <p>"I'll come get the light."</p> <p>"What? I'll join you to find a light." She said.</p> <p>I smiled up at her and gave her a kiss. As we finished our drink, I gave her an even better kiss, tongue probing.</p> <p>"So?" She said.</p> <p>"So?" I said. "Do you want to take me back inside?" I asked. I gave her another kiss. "Maybe you should take me back inside."</p> <p>"It's no trouble," she said.</p> <p>"I don't blame you if you don't want to go." She started to protest.</p> <p>My wife looked at me. I put my finger to her lips, stopping her.</p> <p>"Don't worry, I'll take care of it." I smiled to myself. She gave a big smile back then turned away as she said "But I don't think tonight is the night."</p> <p>It was about a mile outside her apartment building but we said nothing for a while. About half way there I told her I was ready for another drink. I picked up our drinks and went back to her apartment to tell her I was leaving and get hers.</p> <p>She smiled her understanding, as I walked back.</p> <p>We got to her place and we sat near her couch. I lit up my cigarette and handed the lighter to her.</p> <p>"So, what did you think about tonight?" I asked.</p> <p>"Hmmm...I've really liked it. It sounded like it'd be pretty fun, especially if it was us." Her eyes held nothing but determination in them.</p> <p>"You really like it?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yeah. I don't want it to be a bad night."</p> <p>"Then why not?" I asked.</p> <p>"It's not like you're going to fuck me or anything," she said. "You don't want to do it."</p> <p>"Because," I said. "It's not that I don't want it to be fun. It just is."</p> <p>"Okay," she said.</p> <p>We sat there for a while, her eyes shining at me.</p> <p>"So...what made it different? Where did you come from?" I asked. "It's not exactly how we've been spending an evening."</p> <p>"It's more like how I'm spending it now," she said.</p> <p>"And you're not the same woman," I said. "I'm sorry, you know I don't even remember our first date."</p> <p>I turned her face so her eyes looked directly at me. I wanted to see her eyes again.</p> <p>"You're still a virgin, you want me to be your first," I said.</p> <p>She stared at me.</p> <p>"So, you just want to be my first?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yes," she said.</p> <p>I was puzzled.</p> <p>"The night that we...did it," she said.</p> <p>"And how did you feel about it?"</p> <p>"I wanted to be with you, but after the things you've said I wanted that too."</p> <p>"But it's not sex?" I asked, concerned.</p> <p>"It's no sex as long as we can be friends," she said.</p> <p>I was about to speak when I heard the sound of a key at the door. Looking up I spotted the door open slightly. She just stared at me for what seemed like forever.</p> <p>"So, where's the playroom? Why don't you take your pants off for me and we can watch some more TV?" I said.</p> <p>She just stared at me for the longest time, before she slowly slipped her clothes off. She got a look of awe on her face.</p> <p>"It's amazing," she said. "I really liked how you watched it while I stroked myself."</p> <p>"So, is it okay if I help you undress?" I asked.</p> <p>"I guessâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
