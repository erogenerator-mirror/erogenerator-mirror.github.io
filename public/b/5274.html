I wondered, looking around me curiously.</p> <p>"What are you trying to hide?" My sister's voice interrupted my thoughts. "You can't leave your parents with a hard on, can you? They're going to be in the next room. I'll be there." It was a very serious tone of voice.</p> <p>"I can't do that." I said. "I don't know why..." I blushed, trying my best to mask my embarrassment by covering up my erection.</p> <p>"It won't be as bad once I figure out who you are, baby."</p> <p>I nodded, trying to focus on my studies.</p> <p>"Don't worry about it. I'll come help you find your girlfriend. She's good, and she's a great teacher. We'll have you in bed when I get there."</p> <p>I looked at my sister. Her face was beautiful. And with her sexy lips, I could tell her body was really toned. Her breasts strained outward, nipples jutting out. Her stomach was flat, and her thighs bulged as she stood. She was very athletic. The skirt was very tight around her ass, and I couldn't believe I was staring at her thighs.</p> <p>I was so distracted by her legs that I barely noticed her eyes going to the bulge in my crotch.</p> <p>"Don't worry, I have plenty of room. Don't worry about it. Let me just do my research."</p> <p>I watched her walk away, all the way through the house. She stood at the end of the hall, and I could clearly see what was going on in the next room.</p> <p>"You can probably see more of him on the way over," she said.</p> <p>I was surprised by her statement, because she could see clearly through the wall. The door was open, and I could clearly hear faint voices. I was in the middle of my bed, and I could hear someone moving about in the house. I didn't think a person could hear that sound inside the house, but I heard it on the third floor outside.</p> <p>"There he is." I heard Sarah whisper. "He just wanted to find his girlfriend. I guess he saw me." Suddenly, a very loud voice came from the end of our room. It sounded like a woman's voice, and it only got louder as I listened.</p> <p>"What?" I asked.</p> <p>"Just follow your girlfriend's lead." Said a female voice. "She's going to make you cum real good."</p> <p>I froze. I never heard Sarah say that, but I was sure that I heard her say it loud.</p> <p>"Who is that?" I asked. "You must be the one I've heard the other night."</p> <p>The woman was not female, but she was definitely female. "What?" I asked, looking at her. "If she's going to make me, I can't be watching. Please turn the other way."</p> <p>As this woman spoke, she walked up to the doorframe, and looked past me.</p> <p>"If you really don't like it, just turn the other way." She asked.</p> <p>"I don't know." I answered, then turned to look at her.</p> <p>She was not the same woman I remember. This new one had longer hair than the girl I was having sex with, and she was much stronger with her fists in her hands. I couldn't see her feet, but her legs were crossed in front of her.</p> <p>"I'm going to be taking advantage of you right now." Sarah said to me with a smile. "You just have to follow your girlfriend's instructions. The first one, you'll find. Trust me."</p> <p>I leaned into the wall for a moment. I didn't know what I was doing, and I certainly didn't know what she was going to ask me. The woman just stood over me, smiling and talking to me as she moved down the hallway with a woman who spoke to her.</p> <p>"What's wrong?" I asked her. I couldn't hear who this thing was on the other side of the wall, and she obviously couldn't see me looking.</p> <p>"It'll help us find your girlfriend. She's here, and she might just be your girlfriend."</p> <p>I looked up at her and was disappointed, for not being able to see her face.</p> <p>"She might be a very attractive person. Do you think she'd want to be with you?"</p> <p>I didn't answer.</p> <p>The woman moved over top of me on I-5, and I could hear her soft moans. Before I knew it, she had slipped her panties from herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
