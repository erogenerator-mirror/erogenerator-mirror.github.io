Hurt?" She looked at him again, a hurt smile on her lips. "I'm a tough girl. I mean, I hate being alone, but there's no way that I can deal with this right now." She smiled, that smile that made him love her in ways that he'd never thought he would.</p> <p>"I want everything you need, sweetheart" he smiled back.</p> <p>She rolled her eyes. "And what? What's to have?" "Let's go."</p> <p>She put her arms around his neck and pressed her chest against his as they walked slowly upstairs. As they reached the top of her steps, he took her shoulders, and said "Now, before we go anywhere, you just might want to take off your blouse, so that we can see more skin." She raised her arms up, and he reached under them to release the spaghetti straps. He was so gentle and loving, and she closed her eyes as he removed the last piece of clothing.</p> <p>She stood there in her bra and skirt, feeling very vulnerable. "Can I take off my bra for you?"</p> <p>"Of course." He stood back and looked at her breasts for a minute, taking them in his hands as he lifted them.</p> <p>"Mmm. They're nice." He ran his fingers up under the strap, and she tilted her head a bit to show that she enjoyed it. He took the other one into his own hand, and with a gentle hand he opened it and began rubbing around the nipple which he took in his fingers and held firm. She held her breath, and he let his thumb press down hard on the hard bud. Her breathing became heavier, as she tried to concentrate on staying still.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want me do that?" He looked at her as he played with her nipple, and she leaned forward to meet him. He slipped a finger into the cup of her bra, which he pulled up to her breasts before releasing it. He brought the finger to his mouth lightly, and traced his tongue over the outline before releasing the breast.</p> <p>She took a long deep breath as he leaned down to lick and bite the other side once, before bringing his tongue to her nipple again. Her back arched as he pulled the other nipple into his mouth.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want to do this?" He said his voice husky. "I mean, do you want to?"</p> <p>She just let her breath escape in her chest and she put her hand over his to stop him.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," she finally whispered. "No...no...not yet. This is not what I want."</p> <p>She let her hand fall to his lap, where she ran it against his erection.</p> <p>"Just let them do the work. Let them make you feel good."</p> <p>He let her feel him rise above her as he bent his head to kiss her again, and she let him lead her to the master bedroom. She could hear him close the bathroom door as he undressed and was surprised how hot and heavy his breathing was becoming. The heat and passion in his face, the look on his face as he undressed his clothes made her want to cry out when they touched her body. It was as if he was in control, and she had no idea that she was about to make love with her boss, yet she found herself doing it as he lay on the bed, still fully clothed. There was something about the fact that she had felt that she was in charge, and with that thought came the rush of feeling that would come later at the end, when he would take her to the brink and tell her just to keep going. She lay on the bed, and he joined her as he pulled the nightie over her head. He ran his hands all over her, starting with her shoulders, neck, breasts, stomach, thighs, where their bodies would be on display. When he reached her belly button, he rubbed his fingers along the soft flesh there, making her shiver. He slipped his hand back down to her thighs, just below her skirt. She put her hand down on his shoulder and moved herself closer to him, pressing her sex against his hardness.</p> <p>"You don't have to tell me to stop," she said, "I like it." He slid his fingertips to her panties, and she lifted her hips as he slid them down her legs. She watched as his fingers hooked in the edges and pulled them away from his body, revealing a dark patch. His eyes focused on the wet fabric as he rubbed the tip of his penis against the wetness he had found between her thighs. She was already wet, and he could feel the muscles in her sex. She was as tight as they appeared, and it was more than she was used to.
