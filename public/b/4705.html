She could almost feel a part of her, the one that belonged... somewhere, in herself, inside her, she thought as she felt her pussy tingle yet again at the thought of where that belonged, it belonged to her boyfriend again. It belonged here, somewhere, in her new life. She turned her head to look quickly around the store, noting that it looked a little bit brighter at this time. She looked across the store toward the door, and saw that it opened almost completely away from her. She turned her head to the next aisle, and noticed an older man leaning against the doorframe, obviously looking for things, he said with an uncertain grin.</p> <p>"Hey there, come on in, could you get me a bag out for a new suit? I bought this one a few months ago, there really isn't anything more to it." He stepped into the shop, and closed the door behind him. "Here," she said, stepping toward him. She reached out for her bag, putting it on the ground before looking at the suit in front of her. "What is it?"</p> <p>He smiled, his eyes bright and friendly with something other than embarrassment. "It's a bathing suit. They usually don't come with the top," he said.</p> <p>She blushed, her cheeks burning with embarrassment. "Oh. It's beautiful. Please... just buy me some, like... a little bikini." She smiled nervously again. "Can I just look at it?"</p> <p>He raised an eyebrow. "Sure," he said. "I wouldn't have minded if you took your top off to look at it. This one is a little more modest."</p> <p>She smiled. "Thank you," she said. They had gotten a few more swimsuits over the years, and she hadn't tried to hide herself from the looks. It didn't help that one man, a handsome, younger man, had followed her down the aisle, trying not to be as he was a couple of nights a week around.</p> <p>After checking the suit, they shook hands, both almost seeming to be in a hurry. He took hers in his hand, and she took it without a word as she glanced up the length of it. She felt a twinge of excitement as she looked at how slim he had become, and how good looking it was.</p> <p>"You'd better keep it out of your hair, you'll be much closer to mom."</p> <p>"My first date," he said as he looked her in the eye, holding out his hand. "I can't tell you how much it means to me to see you like this," he continued as he gently rubbed her hand.</p> <p>She was taken aback, not only by the hand he held it, but also by the fact that he had only just managed to put this on, holding the top of her bathing suit in his hand. The suit was a light yellow, and seemed to float through the air a bit. "Oh, my God!" she thought, and looked down. "Is that really a bathing suit? This thing's... wow!" he said. "I'd guess it's a size twelve or so."</p> <p>She nodded. "I'd say it's a size 10," she said, as her heart was racing. "I can't believe I was staring at this thing."</p> <p>"You weren't looking at it because you were afraid that your boyfriend would notice," he said as a smile played around his lips.</p> <p>"Actually, it wasn't that bad." She glanced toward the door again, and saw that it was closing. "I had a pretty good time."</p> <p>"I think you will," he said as he smiled. "And I'm sure a lot of people would have noticed if the bottoms didn't," he said as he looked down the suit, noting how slim it was, how hard it was, how tiny it was. "I always wondered what it would be like..." he hesitated, looking over the top of her bathing suit. "I used to wonder what it would be like... to be completely naked," he said as his eyes moved on, seeing just how small it was.</p> <p>"I never thought that it would be so... shocking," she said as she realized he didn't look as he did.</p> <p>"It will be different this time around," he said as he turned and leaned down, resting his head on his hands, smiling. "I like how it makes me feel," he said, looking her in the eyes. "I've been with women here before, but never before I... I mean... not like this," he said as he lifted his head up, looking her over. "This suit makes me..." he said as he looked up into her eyes again, as he rubbed his hands together.</p> <p>Sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
