It was an old fashion thing but still, I thought for sure, it looked sexy on you." I asked. "What did you think of it, then?"</p> <p>"Oh it was hot!" She said with a smile.</p> <p>"You think I like it?"</p> <p>"I guess you do," she laughed. "It's hot."</p> <p>"It's the kind of hot that just makes a woman hotter." Then to break the uncomfortable silence I added, "You might want to look away, the people in there could be watching this."</p> <p>"Oh I don't care. If people would watch me, I'd get over it," she laughed. "I'd even have some fun."</p> <p>"Well, you're not having some fun," I told her, giving her ass a squeeze. "Now that's better."</p> <p>There was a moment of awkwardness as I stared and then I went back to the story we had started. "Well, at least now we know why we came here. I'd really thought the first few times you looked at me and talked with my roommate. That first time, she was so fucking hot," I said.</p> <p>"And now we know why they're watching this," she said. "So, if they're seeing us right now, what are they going to think?"</p> <p>"I don't know," I told her. "I'll have to wait until they get here."</p> <p>"Just get some wine," she said.</p> <p>We went back in and we sat in the chairs. She took her glass from me and handed it to me. There was a moment of awkward silence, then I got a look at the girls sitting around us. I could see they were trying to decide what to do next.</p> <p>"So, what do you think?" She asked.</p> <p>"What do you mean?" I asked.</p> <p>She shrugged her shoulders and replied, "Well, I do like what I saw, it makes me hot but that was way more than that."</p> <p>I paused and stared at her.</p> <p>"Can you feel it, too?" My roommate asked.</p> <p>She nodded and smiled. So, I did feel a little. Not just a little bit, but almost completely, like it was the moment she was waiting for.</p> <p>"You get hard thinking about that?" She asked. "It got that way when I was with our college football team."</p> <p>"If we weren't all over eighteen I wouldn't have a hard-on for nearly a week," I answered.</p> <p>"You really don't have a hard-on do you? You can't imagine how hard I get when you're staring at my titties." She turned to them and ran her fingers over her erect nipples. "Do you mind?" she asked playfully.</p> <p>They took a long drink from their wine and gave me an uncomfortable moment.</p> <p>"Yeah, of course not," I said. "That's what I was doing."</p> <p>"I don't mind at all. I like it. I like your attention." She leaned back and smiled.</p> <p>"Well, what did you like? I like what's about to happen, too," she said.</p> <p>I looked over to the young man sitting in the other chair. He smiled and reached over and gave her his hand. She took it and leaned over to kiss him. In a few seconds time, the two girls were back in the bathroom on the other side of the room.</p> <p>The boys stared at them for a moment and then looked back at me.</p> <p>"Are they watching us?" They asked in unison.</p> <p>"Don't worry about it," I answered. "It's probably just a hand job from someone you know."</p> <p>"But, I feel so naked, so vulnerable, in front of these people," I said, looking at the three of us. "I guess that's my excuse for looking at them." It had an embarrassed undertone.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" She asked again.</p> <p>"I'm sure. They're watching us," I shrugged.</p> <p>We didn't hear them turn on the shower and go.</p> <p>"I guess everyone will know when they come back down after lunch," I said. "And, if anyone wants to go get dinner, we can come right back and put on our swimsuits and go out and do it again."</p> <p>She let go of my hand and sat back down.</p> <p>"You don't see them, do you?" she asked.</p> <p>It was hard to say, because the expression on her face changed from nervousness to a little embarrassment.</p> <p>"Yeah, sure, they'll know, you don't worry about them.
