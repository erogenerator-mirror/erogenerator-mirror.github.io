He said, "We don't want your mom to get the wrong idea; we don't want to scare you off for me, and to get her into my bed. But it's not you you want to have sex with."</p> <p>As soon as Mary was standing in front of him again, she kissed him, not one, but several times. She kissed him and he kissed her back. She pulled back, standing back to look at him, "Did I do that?"</p> <p>He smiled, "You sure did, but you better come on in for my bath." With a big grin, he pulled her toward his bedroom and out of the bathroom. As she stepped in, he started to shut the door, then turned and smiled at her, a mischievous smile as he said, "In bed with me, I got us a bath." He reached out and pulled her close and kissed her, her tongue sliding into his mouth as he sucked on his. They held the kiss for several moments, just long enough for him to take her hand and he led her by the hand to his bedroom, and they undressed. As soon as they were naked, they both stepped up on the bed, facing each other, facing their sides. He bent down, taking her face in his hands, his mouth just inches from hers. They kissed and he moved his kisses across her neck and shoulders. He moved his lips down across her chest to her nipples. Kissing her hard and deep with each suck on her nipple. He slid his hands down and grasped her breasts, pulling her breasts upwards as he nibbled on them, then moved his lips and moved down to her stomach. He knelt down and started to move his head lower, until he lay between her thighs and his tongue slid across and over her pussy, moving between her lips until he hit her clit. They both sighed as he held her, rubbing at it as he slipped a finger into her. She was so wet, so ready that he slid easily in and out. Leaning down, they hugged as they kissed passionately, their tongues sliding around each others.</p> <p>He moved his finger inside her again as he continued his assault on her clit, sliding three, then four fingers in and out of her as his other fingers found their way to her ass. They moved closer to each other, pressing their bodies together as his fingers probed her pussy. He slipped his fingers out of her pussy and put his tongue in her ass, sliding up her ass towards her pussy. The feeling was so intense when he rimmed her it drove Mary crazy. She lifted her legs, crossing them over his, causing his hips to press against hers. She could feel the bulge in his pants pressing into her soft flesh as he continued to play with her ass, slowly pulling his fingers from her as his tongue began to move back and forth. She opened her eyes and looked down to where his fingers were still probing her. He turned her around, laying her back down on the bed so that her head was between his legs and her ass was in front him. He moved his mouth to her pussy, sucking on it, his tongue darting in and out of her as he moved his hips up a little bit. He moved down a little to her opening, moving his mouth back and forth over her lips. Mary could feel his hardness rubbing on her inner leg as he moved his hips back and forth, his hard cock pressing into her hard as he kissed her.</p> <p>He moved down between her legs, kissing, licking and sucking on her lips and clit as he pulled back up to her. Her wetness was covering his lips and nose all the way around. Moving up to enter her, he pulled back out a little, then he slid back in, taking it in completely. The sensation was exquisite as he moved and massaged at her from behind. Mary could feel it building inside her, moving up to her tummy, her breasts, down her chest to the tip of her nipples. As she moved her arms around him, feeling his hardness in her arms, she closed his hands around her breast, rubbing her hard nipple into his palm. She moved one hand to her pussy, rubbing her pussy as he moved his head to her nipple. His tongue flicked across her nipple as his hands slid up and down her body. Her body began to writhe slightly as pleasure built inside her. She moved one arm around him, one hand down between them, wanting more contact as he moved one leg up and pulled her to him. She slid her hand up his thigh as he continued to move steadily in and out of her. He stopped kissing her and stood up. He slid one hand around his waist, the other around her shoulder to hold her as he moved his hips to line up with hers.</p> <p>She could feel the wetness of his cock sliding across her pussy and herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
