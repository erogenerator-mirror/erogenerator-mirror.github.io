He had been on one of his many trips to Italy, and then on to Hawaii in the winter, and now, he was with a lady, who had come in to stay with him and his family during his last summer. She was beautiful.</p> <p>He was a little concerned about what was happening at home. He saw no reason to get married now, to avoid any issues of commitment. What he wanted to do was to get away from those worries, not stay and think about his life in the moment.</p> <p>He had been at the start of his relationship with his mother, but in the interim had learned to think about the situation. He knew his mother would not have had any problems in raising him if she had not gotten pregnant. He just had to try to be more careful.</p> <p>He had dated several men in his life, but not to the point of marriage. He had been involved with several women before his mother began to raise him in the world. He didn't date much after his last encounter with his girlfriend in the summer.</p> <p>Since then, he had been trying to find another partner in the life of a married man. It was hard to find any suitable man. Most never came close to meeting his needs.</p> <p>He and his girlfriend had been on a very busy cruise. He was the star on the ship when its crew landed. He was the first to arrive in the Bahamas before the ship took off. She had landed first, but she couldn't get a seat at the next port she could dock a week later. They had met and became friends.</p> <p>Now, it was time to try it out. He had started this cruise with his girlfriend of many months. It had been a fun night; but after that, they had started drinking. Even in the dark of night, he could see from her looks that she was in fact sober.</p> <p>He decided to try to find out as much as possible when they had their time in the Bahamas. He could still feel a bit of fear in her, but he could also feel a kind of excitement. It was one thing to get your girlfriend laid after they were married, to have their honeymoon.</p> <p>He tried to get a hold of some friends to come stay with him. He could still remember his mother, as she was still living with him. She had given birth to three daughters. She was still very attractive. He had never been attracted to women his own age, until he had met her in a museum somewhere. He had never been with someone who looked so much like his mother.</p> <p>Once he reached his limit, he decided to find out about his life long lover's. He had spent the night in their bed, and he couldn't deny having had a good time with most of the night. He had also managed to get into the mood with a couple of people he didn't know, or that he was attracted to. None of the men he had dated had been able to satisfy that woman. He just didn't know how he would ever keep it together with that woman. The woman who had been the woman he had met after his mother's death. She had come to him, while he was having a drink too drunk to drive.</p> <p>He was feeling a bit better and decided to see if he could find anything to help him with his problem.</p> <p>He met Sally at her house before leaving the ship. If she didn't already know he could, she didn't have to. He had talked her into his plan and told her about his situation.</p> <p>He told her everything that he had found out. He told her how it had been very sexually satisfying for him, as he hadn't known it was possible to feel a man's penis in his hands. He explained about the fact that he had had two lovers before, but that he never made love to the first lover while his girlfriend remained with him.</p> <p>She told him if he was going to try to get her, he needed to be a bit more careful. She went to him, and he knew he had to do the same.</p> <p>He remembered his mother telling him that he had been a good lover. She said she could tell him that he was more experienced and not to forget his mother. He thought she was right. He had had a good time, but he had learned he was different in every way he knew. He didn't know what to think.</p> <p>He remembered his first encounter with his girlfriend and what had led to that. Things had gone very well. She had not only taken him to bed, but she had also taken care of him, even if it was from an unknown source. She had taught him to be a good lover. She had also coached him on how a man could make love to a woman.</p> <p>He hadâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
