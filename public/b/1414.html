It's that I have some strange ability to make people do things that I have no control over so as not to upset others, things that may be dangerous. So in theory I can make women have sex with other men. Not necessarily in terms of sexual partners, though of course that can happen to men, but things that I like to do, things that I don't usually have the balls to do. And if that is what I wish in theory too? I'm still in no actual control here.</p> <p>It was very late. It was very late in the evening after all. That's when she first let out her little secret. I had been laying down, naked and waiting at the edge of her bed, for her to come, thinking. But when I got up, she was already in position for what seemed like eternity. I was on my back with my mind on the bed, but my legs were spread and she was sliding herself up and down on my cock. Her breasts were swaying above me, the nipples standing out in a different way. I was in that moment. She was moving her hips and moaning. She was moving her body up and down, riding me. I tried to move my hands from my back to her sides, but I was in such a state of confusion all I did was put my hands on her ass and support her.</p> <p>Her hips kept moving faster, and her breasts kept moving. I could feel a little wetness trickling down my leg. She had to be at orgasms in the last few minutes, not in the last hour, and I was almost positive she'd had more then one and I was getting her back to the edge by the time she pulled out and collapsed on the bed beside me. Her hand was still between her legs, and she was playing with herself. I felt like I was floating over a big, ocean. I turned my head in her direction and she smiled just a little bit. I said nothing so she rolled out from under me and got on all fours. She pulled back my bed, leaned over me and licked her fingers out of my juices from my bellybutton. She turned her head towards me, looked me in the eyes and said in a soft voice, "I want you to have a chance to do it. Do it to me. I want it. Do it. Fuck me, David..."</p> <p>That was the exact moment I made the plan. I hadn't even done much research on anal sex to find out if they actually had it. Hell, in retrospect I did, but it's hard for a guy to keep a steady tongue when having to fuck an ass! I had never touched a hole before, not with any of my own fingers. That's not what I had in mind. Well, not the reason for it anyway. I had never been much of a party girl at parties. I wasn't really interested in being anything more then a one man girl, so if I did something that might have made her want that then it would probably mean that she wouldn't want a man. But for the first time in a whole lot of years I had the chance to do what I wanted. I didn't know it at the time, but right from that moment on it was all I would ever consider doing. And I would get the opportunity to do so in every position possible, which would likely be pretty fucking wild from the reactions of a near-naked woman.</p> <p>We were in a motel room, and I hadn't had my cock inside her in about an hour. As she said, I didn't have a lot of experience. I was all a bit unsure why her husband had even said such a thing. It was too early in the evening. I had always liked to give oral sex to my wife, not my kid sister, whom I had often made fun with me. I mean, it was just sex...not, what I was looking for, like it wasn't much fun, I mean, I was my sister in laws, not her sister's husband. As soon as I mentioned this, she leaned down, opened her mouth, opened it, and stuck out her tongue.</p> <p>"Good. I think you might be prepared to do this for me." She said.</p> <p>As she said that she stuck her tongue straight out. Now I guess the idea was a bit too intimate as I have to be pretty casual about anything about sex itself. I had no idea how much I had to really get used to without taking my head in my hands and trying to imagine what it would feel like. I leaned forward and brought my mouth on top of her tongue. And I thought I heard a soft moan come out of her. I didn't stop kissing. I kissed her there for a very long time, letting my lips and tongue slip between her lips and explore whatever she could produce. I even triedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
