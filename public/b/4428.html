"You won't have to do anything, will you baby?"</p> <p>I couldn't take it anymore. I reached out and grabbed her. "I won't."</p> <p>She didn't release me but walked into the kitchen and started to pour herself a cup of tea, placing it into a cup as she took it out. She sat on the edge of the small table opposite the stove, and took a sip of the warm beverage.</p> <p>"Where in the world is your mother?"</p> <p>"In your arms, baby."</p> <p>"Is this your home now?"</p> <p>"Yes, baby, you will find it very nice."</p> <p>"Then, what should I do? Are you going to give me more power?"</p> <p>"No sweetie, you won't have power before I take control over it. You don't even need the strength. You aren't even in control of it now."</p> <p>"No baby, you are not."</p> <p>"But you want to"</p> <p>"Yes, but I want to."</p> <p>"So you're going to let me, to dominate you?"</p> <p>"Yes." She put the cup down on the table and walked over to me.</p> <p>"I want you to come home so you can prove to me that you'll be safe with me. I want to take control every way, every day, every time. I love when you come home, but I want to take the time for our relationship to get back to the way it was before."</p> <p>"Do you love me?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes, very much!"</p> <p>"Do you love what I've done for you?"</p> <p>"I love what I have done for you. I wanted to have kids, but as you say, I had to wait a few years. I love you more now than I ever have, but I also love you like a sister loves her own brother. I just don't know yet," she said as she reached down and stroked my cheek.</p> <p>"I want to make you happy, so I can make you happy too. Come home, baby: I want you home."</p> <p>"I love you, I love you, I love you."</p> <p>I took her in my arms and gently kissed her lips.</p> <p>"Come home, sweetie; we have to be apart."</p> <p>With that I placed her down again on the table and pulled her over to me. Kissing my face, she said: "Are you ready?"</p> <p>I had not done anything else at that point. I knew she was ready; I also knew I would have power of my own if she ever needed it as I had power of my own as she had done. I placed her hands behind her head and gently pulled her face down to mine. I leaned in and we tenderly kissed. I kissed her for a long time before kissing my way down her cheek to her neck. I licked and gently kissed to her ear and began the journey to her breast that I knew could only be mine. I gently sucked on her hardening nipple and the other than moved to the other one. I continued to kiss and suck on her nipples as I did so. I kissed my way down her body, over her belly button to that part of her body that was mine, to which I knew she loved being controlled in those ways. I kissed down her body, my eyes still watching her face, as each time I move down the road she was about to make the next move.</p> <p>As I continued down she opened her eyes with a smile and said, "I love you."</p> <p>"Is that a yes?"</p> <p>"Yes, baby." I said as I moved down and placed her legs over my shoulders, then leaned back for a full view of that beautiful pussy; and to the mouth that was beginning to open in anticipation of me. I was at the gates once again; I wanted all of this to be for real. I moved between her legs and placed them on my shoulders, then placed my hands on her lower abdomen, then began kissing her belly button again. I did this a few times, each time bringing my lips closer to her. I took her right nipple in my mouth and began to lick and suck. I had only had her nipples in my mouth a couple of times.
