My eyes widened. "So beautiful and so naughty." It was all coming from the most precious person on the planet, and the most beautiful man on the planet. His body was the perfect complement to my own, it would make any man happy, and he needed to be with me forever. My hand wrapped around his cock. "You're so big . . ."</p> <p>As I kissed him, he ran his hands through my hair, as if to guide me to a rhythm to follow, or a guide to follow, or a guide and to guide me. We didn't kiss much in the time I was kissing him, although he still kept trying. He tried a few times, but didn't think to try to make me lose interest in him. He made me cum so many times I could barely think.</p> <p>A little while later we were lying naked in bed. He was stroking my legs and arms, and his mouth was teasing my tits. He took one of them in his hand, and gently nibbled the nipple. I felt a warm glow run through my body that started in my pussy, then spread through my whole body. I pulled it to my mouth and began to suck on it softly. He ran his fingernails down my throat, teasing my nipples with his fingernails. I ran my fingers through his beautiful black hair as he sucked on my tits. I slid my fingers under his beard, and then gently down and around his neck. He was so strong yet so gentle and sexy. It felt so good to be held, but I didn't want to scare him off. I kissed his lips and mouth gently.</p> <p>"Lie with me baby, I want to taste you." He rolled us over onto our sides, so I could kiss him again. The kiss was soft and loving. I loved his hands on my body.</p> <p>The next thing I knew my hands were caressing his cock and balls. I slid down until I could lick him between balls and cock. He tasted so good, and I loved the taste of myself on his face, the smell of his body. I took a deep breath as I took him into my mouth. I felt him pulse when I ran my lips up and down. I loved it. When I took every inch of him into my mouth, I could hear him moan and pant. The combination of his moans, and his breathing against my skin sent me spiraling. I loved to have it done to me, to him, the way he touched me. My legs twined around his and I felt him slide into me. My pussy was throbbing, and it was making me very wet. God he felt good in me.</p> <p>He had taken me to the edge, and I knew it wouldn't be long. It wouldn't. I wrapped one leg around his hips, and pulled him inside me. When he was deep enough, I grabbed his shoulders and pulled him in for a long hard kiss. "Sir, please don't get off on my body. I'm not your slave."</p> <p>He slid out of me. He stood at the end of the bed while I looked at him. It was an expression of complete contentment, which made me smile.</p> <p>"Do you love me, my precious slave?" he asked in a soft smooth voice.</p> <p>I leaned up and kissed him. "Yes, you have too much to teach me, Sir. Yes, I love you, Sir."</p> <p>"Good," he said and leaned down to kiss me, sliding a condom on his beautiful cock. "Lay down, honey, I want to feel you. It's time for me to feel what it's like to lose myself inside you, to have you." His voice seemed to be breath taking. It didn't sound like the gentle sex he'd had with all the girls in school that he'd gone to school with. He sounded like a man just dying for release. He was taking the same pleasure he'd given me with the other girls.</p> <p>Before I knew it, I was on top of him, my hands wrapped around his chest, stroking his nipples, and running down to his cock, feeling him pulse as I slid it to me. When I had settled him inside me, I began the rocking motion he liked so much. He'd been in pretty much the same position the previous day, so I knew I was doing the right thing. When he was hard, he slid his hips to my entrance and fucked me slowly, and gently.</p> <p>I was breathing deeply, and slowly, as we did everything we liked together. He wasn't about to cum quickly, nor was he going to cum so quickly. In order to prolong this moment as long as he could, I would start by riding him. He was going crazy from my slow stroking, so I stopped him.</p> <p>"No, Sir, I'm justâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
