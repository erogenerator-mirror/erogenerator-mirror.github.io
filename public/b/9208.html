I grabbed a handful of water from the shelf for us and stepped into it, my cock bouncing around as I walked. I made my way to my bed and slipped next to the lovely Sarah who was quickly asleep, her legs spreading out on the bottom bunk.</p> <p>I moved down the ladder, sitting across from her, her body silhouetted as the light of the moon poured in through the small screen door into the water. I reached onto the bedside table and retrieved a small pitcher, pouring a little into the palm of my hand. I placed it on the floor and knelt next to her in the tub. Her back was slightly arched with one knee bent and her ass thrust out to allow me to dip a little lower into the water. I started the pitcher, handed it to her and moved back and sat down next to Sarah, pulling her to me with my cock still in her ass.</p> <p>We had been chatting about the weekend and the wine glasses and wine bottle was empty. I poured the remaining glass for her and she lifted it and we sipped, my cock hardening and coming out of her ass.</p> <p>"Are you hungry this weekend, honey?" I whispered as I nibbled on her neck.</p> <p>"No," she said softly, "I guess I could do with a little breakfast, huh?"</p> <p>I grinned as she slid down into the water. I had a hard time staying upright as Sarah was lying down. Her legs rose and parted as I moved over to kneel between her legs and placed the glass at the bottom of the tub. She had her eyes closed and I could tell she was asleep. I kissed her deeply and we kissed for a long time; Sarah's breathing even more so and as I returned to my semi-erect cock she murmured.</p> <p>"Mmmm....,"</p> <p>Sarah is one of my favorite models, both for her beauty and her body. I like to think of her as my little girl, but to be honest, I've never been a fan of my girl until now. Even when we played with her a little, our friendship and sexual experience has been very pleasant. I never found the woman's image attractive, nor should I. She never complained, never tried to get in my pants, and I think she enjoys sex as much as I do. She also has a terrific body and looks great when she is relaxed and willing to submit herself or simply take on the task at hand. I think that's a real ego boost for someone who is not quite sure of their own sexuality.</p> <p>We drank about half of the glass and I leaned back against the headboard, my hand resting on her stomach just below her navel. Sarah snuggled up to me, my cock sticking hard in time to the music. Her eyes were closed as she softly purred and began to murmur in the soft music. Her hands were now in my lap and her fingers gently stroking my cock. Her fingers began to tease my cock as our lips continued to kiss deeply.</p> <p>"Come on," she whispered. "I gotta be honest. It's been a long time since I've had someone to cum in me. Do it. Cum for me."</p> <p>At this point, it didn't come naturally. Sarah had learned to masturbate for me. She seemed to love taking the responsibility for herself.</p> <p>"I don't know about you, Sarah, but just feel good. I know it's been a long time since I've had a cock in me."</p> <p>She smiled as she slid her hand down and placed it on my cock, stroking it up and down as she listened to the music in her head.</p> <p>"It sure is," I said, my fingers gently rubbing her thighs under her kilt while I kissed her neck. "I've had a long time as well, too. But before we get started, can I...?"</p> <p>I slid out of her, rising up and offering her my cock to suck, which she willingly took into her throat. Sarah moaned at how sexy it felt. I sat on the side of the tub, my cock slowly sliding out as she bobbed up and down. Sarah slid back as I lifted one leg off the side and spread it. I grabbed her wrist and brought her hand up to my cock. Gently, she began to stroke me up and down. I had never found a blowjob quite this sexual, much like one you could imagine in a porno, especially when you were as horny as Sarah was. I smiled as I reached down and began to stroke her head.</p> <p>I looked down at her sucking my cock, her eyes closed, her head bobbing up and down. She stroked me harder and deeper with her hand as her eyes remained shut.
