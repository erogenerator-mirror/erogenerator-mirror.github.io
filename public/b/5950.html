He never told me," she replied. "I was his first, and that first thing we did together was him fucking me. My first time having sex."</p> <p>"And how did it feel?"</p> <p>"It was, he had an ass pounding me, the next thing I knew he had his cock in my mouth, his hands wrapped in my hair and he wouldn't let me pull off until I was ready."</p> <p>"How was it?"</p> <p>"Like I said there was no other thing. It just happened."</p> <p>"I'm sorry, that makes me feel that way. That's all I can say," I said. "It's been a long time since I've got my cock sucked, and now that it's here, I guess I will," I said, putting my arm around her shoulders and pulling her close to me. "It is a lot to learn about how a woman feels."</p> <p>She giggled. "Okay, then let's do it another way," she said, putting her arms around my neck and pulling me to her. "Oh, god, just let me feel you."</p> <p>As I started to kiss her, she took one of my hands and lifted it over to her pussy. I started to rub her through her pants, working my way up to rubbing her clit. Her tongue came out to meet mine. She had a slight pout to her mouth. If she only knew what I was thinking, no way she would do that in front of me. We were interrupted by the sound of a knock at door.</p> <p>"Who would that be?" I asked.</p> <p>"Room service, a lady of the house," she said.</p> <p>Shit! I thought. We had never even kissed before. If she had just come on in a few seconds she would have done it right there in the hallway, right in front of me. Now she was going to come walking in right now, with an open door, and I was a little pissed. What the hell is wrong with me? What did I do to deserve this? I just got to talking to her yesterday, and I have never once even tried to fuck her. Damn it, fuck it all. Then it comes to me now. Can I just kiss her goodbye? Or can I kiss her again? I can probably do both. The look of disgust on her face must have been worth it.</p> <p>"Oh, God, no," I said.</p> <p>"Oh, honey, don't be such a pussy," I said. "We can't talk about this right now. You really don't want to take anyone home like this."</p> <p>"I love you, you know that?" She said as she leaned in to kiss me. "I just don't want to walk in on you being so mean."</p> <p>I kissed her, which she returned and kissed me back a little harder, our tongues playing with each others as I felt her hand come around to cup my balls through my jeans.</p> <p>She backed away from me. "You know, I should take that to the bedroom. I really do want to have some fun, and I've already told you that I love you a lot, but you just got to be patient."</p> <p>Well shit. "I know, but it is going to be a while before I can get you to let me play with your pussy again."</p> <p>"Well, okay, but just do me a big favor."</p> <p>"What is it?"</p> <p>"I don't want to be the only one leaving your apartment tonight. I want you to go take a nap in my bed while I'm gone, and then I'll clean up a little while after I leave."</p> <p>"What about dinner, and what about this."</p> <p>"That's fine. I'll do the rest." I reached over to squeeze her ass as I watched her head off like it was the most perfectly natural thing in the world. I could hear her running around the hallway. She probably never goes upstairs to her room without knowing what I was doing, and I couldn't wait for her to finish cleaning up.</p> <p>********************</p> <p>I woke up around 1:30 a.m. to a loud knocking on my apartment door. Shit! I'd had sex with two women in my life, and now it was a new experience. I must have been loud enough, because it came out as a little squeak.</p> <p>"Hello?" I said.</p> <p>"Who's there?" a voice said.</p> <p>"My God!" I thought to myself, "What in the hell is going on here? It's not just my ex. Why is she here?</p> <p>"Hi, I think you've hadâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
