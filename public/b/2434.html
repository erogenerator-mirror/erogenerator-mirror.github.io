My lips were locked on hers as my hips slapped against her ass cheeks. My balls slapped up against her with every thrust I made into her. My body was a rutting machine as each wave of ecstasy went over me. I was lost to the world, like a little boy about to lose his virginity, and when it ended I couldn't even tell time in time, as my mind lost all semblance of focus, as my muscles tensed and then the explosion began, as my body was a quivering wave of pleasure.</p> <p>We were both silent for a long moment as my orgasm continued at the edge of orgasm. Then, she kissed me, her hand covering mine as I wrapped my fingers around hers. Together we stroked each others hands, and we just stared and stared into each others eyes as we held each other and kissed passionately. Her other hand held my cock and guided it to her sex as she ground her clit onto it and slid me into her, her hips driving me into her once more before her body relaxed.</p> <p>I still held her gently as we lay motionless, our bodies just melting into each others embrace. I was the middle-man in my world, and my mind was on an upside-down axis. I was just her, my entire world. She held me tightly, and we kissed again, my dick filling up her so full that I was almost afraid I would drown in her.</p> <p>Finally, she released her hold on me, and I rolled off her onto the bed. We sat up and faced each other, and as we looked into each others eyes, I gently kissed her. "I shouldn't have done that with you, sweetheart, but thank you for making my night special."</p> <p>She laughed and cuddled against me, still holding my cock in her hands, "Are you ok, baby? I thought you were going to give me a piece this time."</p> <p>"I'm not sure, but I will take it as a compliment, and I didn't mean to do anything that might cause you to regret it."</p> <p>"Ok, that was wonderful," and we kissed again, her body still mine, her hips still mine. "Now we can really relax and enjoy each other."</p> <p>I kissed her neck and shoulders, "As is your right, my wife." I kissed her face, kissed her forehead and her eyelids, then kissed her lips. And then kissed it again, her tongue flicking across my bottom lip, and her arms snaking around my neck, "Thank you, that was really amazing."</p> <p>"I'm not sure about that, you have to admit that." She smiled and kissed my mouth. "But let's finish this and put some clothes away, before we get too hot."</p> <p>I just lay there, as she got up and pulled her panties and jeans back on. Then she walked with me out to the bathroom to dry off. Her body felt so soft to touch, and her touch was so innocent, and she was so soft in my arms, and her ass was so firm. The image of what I was doing to her made me hard again, and I wanted to be back inside her soon. She reached for and then dried herself off in the mirror, and then left to go off to take a shower.</p> <p>I heard her shower running and turned over to her. "So what do you think of what you just heard?"</p> <p>"Well, I'm not sure, but I think you might be right," and we both laughed. I got up and walked over to the sink. I washed my hair and combed it for the first time since we'd been here together. Her hair was a little more blond, and I wondered if she did the same. That's just what made me so horny to watch her take her shower. She was watching me, and her eyes were glued to my body as my body twitched and throbbed. I could imagine her taking every inch of me into her mouth, fucking my cock with her lips and tongue and the head of my prick with her tongue.</p> <p>But I wanted something else and pulled out my watch from outside the door.</p> <p>"What time is it?" she asked.</p> <p>"Just after ten," I answered.</p> <p>She had taken off her clothes and stepped into the shower again. "I want to shower in your shower, too."</p> <p>"Okay, but just for a few minutes," I said, "and then we can go."</p> <p>"Alrighty then."</p> <p>We kissed again, then she got some shaving gel out of the bathroom and applied it. Her body was smooth as silk as she knelt in front of me, and I was treated to the sight of her face disappearing in the water.
