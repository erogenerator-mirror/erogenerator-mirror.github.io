It turned out that they had been experimenting for awhile with experimenting in front of us, but it certainly wasn't going to take long for either one of them to go over the edge. They were not only still a little shy about their nakedness, though. They were not even aware of that, either. Bethany looked directly at me and waved towards her friend, and I did the same towards my wife. We then turned our gaze back towards Katie, and Katie began to get up, and Bethany gave her a wink.</p> <p>"Here, you two sit down and I'll show you some poses," and the girls followed me into the kitchen.</p> <p>"Katie's done some modeling for us and she's got a great body. I can see why you two love it so much." It's not unusual for women to comment about this.</p> <p>"So, Bethany did all of the work. Do you like mine?" Bethany asked.</p> <p>"Well, she's got great legs. I think she keeps them pretty long."</p> <p>"Well, let's get started," Bethany laughed.</p> <p>Bethany and her new friend were soon naked, and we all got down to some more nude poses, except for Katie's outfit, which she had on earlier.</p> <p>"You two want to get naked too?" Bethany asked us. "Or should I just do it on my own?"</p> <p>The girls started to move away from us, but Bethany grabbed our hands and pulled us towards the bedroom.</p> <p>"I've got a surprise for you guys," and Bethany walked away to her computer desk. She opened the bottom drawer, took out her vibrator, and got out a box of condoms. She walked over to Katie, took out the condom, and got in front of her.</p> <p>"Come on. It'll be fun." Bethany pulled her closer and kissed her. Katie leaned forward and kissed her too, but the hug was short and they didn't leave the room.</p> <p>"What are those for?" Katie asked as she grabbed Bethany's arm.</p> <p>"For making love. Let Katie and I use the condoms?"</p> <p>"Oh, I don't think so."</p> <p>"You can go ahead and use the condoms," Bethany said with a smile.</p> <p>"Yes," I said and went to follow her, but Bethany grabbed me and pulled me back. "Oh, wait," she said as she led me out to the bedroom. "That's enough. I'm not done." Then she grabbed the condom out of the box and handed it to me. I took it, and as I approached the bed, my wife was just finishing getting in. It was a couple of inches longer than me, and I didn't think I was going to be able to go any further up a woman's pussy, let alone up to her cervix, but it was a struggle to get my legs beneath me, though.</p> <p>Then there was the difference in how quickly or quickly Bethany and I got into bed together, with two beds. This was one bed we had already planned, and that had to be the only bed. I did my best to hold back my tears from seeing my wife's naked body in the bright light of the bathroom next to mine. I felt my heart pounding and I was terrified to see Bethany in that position. I realized that she had not wanted to go any further and that there would be no going back with Katie.</p> <p>We had been making love for the last five or six hours, but as I began to feel my pussy starting to get numb, I was not sure I wanted it at all. I had only just begun to lose control of myself when my stomach convulsed as I let out a loud orgasm and a scream. If I had thought that I had made the climax because it was that good, then I had no idea it was what I was doing. The whole experience was one that I was never sure I would enjoy as much as I had. I just kept it going. I would have sworn I felt Bethany getting off, but somehow that was enough for me. After that little scream, all that came was the quiet and the groaning and our heavy breathing. I thought that I was going to faint. Just seeing Bethany's body and looking at her in the glow of the setting light of the bathroom made it seem like the night had just come to a close, though. Katie and Bethany were already on their knees with their hands down each other's clothes, so there would be no awkwardness in their embrace. But that was not true. I could also tell it was Bethany, though. She put one of her hands on her friend's face and softly said, â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
