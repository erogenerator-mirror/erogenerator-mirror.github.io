What do you say I make us some breakfast while we wait for your mom," Ken said.</p> <p>He turned on his heel and walked towards her. They both got on the cart and they proceeded to breakfast. As soon as they got into the kitchen the breakfast was set up in the room. As soon as it was set up she started talking to the chef.</p> <p>After breakfast they had some time to themselves so they got into bed and made love. Their morning coupling was passionate, fulfilling and very loving.</p> <p>************</p> <p>Ken went back into town to get his mail. As he returned to his office he got a surprise. It was his neighbor's daughter Marie's and his house. It was a surprise. Ken smiled. He had a good time with the neighbor. He made dinner and cooked it in his spare room. As they were eating they were talking. Marie was very excited. It seemed obvious they had a great time together. Ken asked if it was Ok if she would like to go out with them.</p> <p>Marie smiled. "Well, we can have the next few hours together. After we finish eating I should be home before ten so if it will make you happy. Just say yes."</p> <p>Ken sat there thinking about the offer. Here he was at his house. He wondered what she looked like and when. He felt proud he had an invite to dinner with three beautiful girls. He was very turned on knowing them. Ken got up from the table and walked to Marie.</p> <p>She stood up and wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him. Marie had a sweet taste to her kiss.</p> <p>"Can we call it a night?" Marie asked.</p> <p>Ken kissed her and said, "Of course we can. I don't think I can stand it any more.</p> <p>"You just have to make sure you call when you are home," Marie said smiling as she broke off the kiss.</p> <p>Ken kissed Marie again and gave her hand a squeeze. Then he picked up the phone.</p> <p>"Hello. It's me. Ken. Your girlfriend says she has a surprise for you."</p> <p>"Hello," Ken said to Marie.</p> <p>"Ken, Marie will you please talk with me so I can be sure I have everything you need. Please talk to me." Marie said to Ken.</p> <p>Ken answered the door. "Hello dear. You have come home early. Yes, I am home before ten. I am not sure if I should tell you or not."</p> <p>Marie said, "Ken I love you. You don't know that."</p> <p>Ken answered, "Marie, if I was half a boy I would feel guilty. I am not doing anything."</p> <p>"There must be a reason." Marie said as she handed Ken the phone.</p> <p>"Do you like the house? I know you have an apartment so I want to make a little money for you." Ken asked.</p> <p>"Marie you are more than everything. I really do like it. My brother is out of town on business. I am going to help you move in." Marie said.</p> <p>She took the phone away from Ken.</p> <p>"Ken, can you talk to me. I have been telling you about me and my boy friend. Will you help me move in?" Marie said.</p> <p>Ken sat back.</p> <p>"Come on. What is the plan?" Ken asked.</p> <p>"You'll just be a part time gardener until you start your job. Will that solve a lot of the problem?" Marie asked.</p> <p>Ken thought about what Marie had said, "The idea is a lot of work, and there is money from the apartment."</p> <p>Marie looked at Ken. "Ken you're not going to get away with it? I can't take a chance."</p> <p>"Marie I can't do that, I want you to stay with me. After dinner tonight we can go to the neighborhood park after we finish dinner." Ken said.</p> <p>Marie's eyes got wide and her mouth dropped open.</p> <p>"I will do it. Ken, I really do want to stay with you."</p> <p>Ken knew Marie had no intentions for staying with him. He could see the look in her eyes.</p> <p>"OK, I'll do it," Ken said.</p> <p>Marie was excited to take the offer but Ken knew the payoff would be great. A part time gardener and his friend would be living together. If Marie went with Ken and the neighbors and that would be a lot more than ten hours.</p> <p>"You two will do it, just like old times," Ken said.</p> <p>Ken hung up the phone and they both looked at each other nervously.</p> <p>Marie thought, "Oh my God, Ken, what's happenedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
