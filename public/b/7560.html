How did you decide that someone like her, would have sex like that? She was really so attractive."</p> <p>"I had the whole plan in mind," I replied. "She could be my wife and still have sex. If she wanted to, I was willing to let her have sex with other men. I just never thought that she would be able to get the real thing, and it had been three weeks of denial. She had to try it to really feel real. I guess the only thing I really didn't like about her was that when she masturbated, she came and came for the first time, and then when it was over and she just collapsed in a heap on the bed, her hands fell free and she just collapsed with me."</p> <p>Jill sat staring at me for a while, "What about you?"</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. I really had a lot on my mind when I heard about you being with her, that made me realize that she wasn't my wife. Did she ever get close to you?"</p> <p>"No. She had been with another man, you know. I didn't know if she knew, or even if she was still in the area. She seemed so happy about spending time with me."</p> <p>"So you really can't have sex with me? Is that it?"</p> <p>"Well, not exactly, but I don't really care what she does, if she is interested in sex with other guys. I think it depends on what she wants to do or not. I just wouldn't feel comfortable doing anything wrong, and if she wanted to go further with this, I would happily have sex with her after an or almost. I'm very satisfied that I have never let a cock come close to me in all of my relationships, and even then, I've made love to many women who have cheated on me, but to be honest, I've never enjoyed being with so many people at once. This has been an interesting challenge though."</p> <p>"I guess we have to learn to be less self-conscious," Jill said. "At least that is what I'd hope we would do." I took Jill to the couch in my old room across from the one we shared. "This should just keep you calm, and after awhile, it will calm your nervousness." That would be easy for me to get comfortable, because I still loved sex with Jill, and had been very much in love with her.</p> <p>Jill lay on her back. I moved down and knelt between her legs. Her pussy lips were pink and swollen, waiting to be explored by my tongue. I began licking her lips. She moaned and I smiled. I could taste her already mixed with the salty, salty pungent taste of cum.</p> <p>"Did it make you very horny?" I asked.</p> <p>"Mmmmmmm, yes." Her hips pushed upward toward me. I licked my way down. "Oh yes, right there. I can barely feel you!" I moved up to her pussy. My tongue traced her lips. Her taste was stronger than I had imagined, but not necessarily a lot of tang. I opened my mouth and pushed my tongue as far up into her as it would go, where the taste seemed to increase even more.</p> <p>"I wish you were here too," Jill moaned. "How about we go have a big, hard, passionate fuck?" Jill lay back and I rose up on my knees to enter her.</p> <p>I moved inside of her and began fucking her. She was so wet it wasn't really that bad of a sensation to start from and I could easily move smoothly and smoothly without any difficulty, although I knew that some things took longer for a slow, even in the midst of multiple orgasms.</p> <p>As soon as I started my slow stroked, I was really beginning to feel something building in Jill's pussy. I could feel her pussy start to stretch, and when I felt it begin to take on a tight grip around my hard cock, I knew it was her first orgasm. She came again and again and, while she did so, she pushed her hips back up, trying to take me deeper inside of her.</p> <p>"OH GOD!!!" she cried out when she came, not in pain, but in pleasure. She was still holding on to me, and in a way, she was now more afraid of hurting me as she was concerned that I might hurt her, or I might not let her have my cock fully buried in her pussy. She had said to me that she didn't want to be hurt, and to take me there. She was going to take it. She just wanted to be with me, and she was going to get itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
