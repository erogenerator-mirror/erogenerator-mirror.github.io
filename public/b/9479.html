Not much tongue, but enough to make me dizzy. Then she moved her face down my chest and around to my left side, her small hands running up both of my legs. My dick was still hard from earlier when I started to stroke it. She sucked and kissed my entire body until I was breathing hard again. Then she went back to my dick and sucked it again, this time taking the whole thing down her throat. She worked her mouth up and down my cock. We both were starting to come, and I felt her body jerk against mine in another orgasm.</p> <p>“We were going to share this again…” she said over my dick.</p> <p>“We better be careful,” I joked.</p> <p>They were quiet for a bit. I couldn’t believe how excited I was after that. We both laid there for 15 minutes before getting up and going back down stairs to the kitchen. We both were thirsty and wanted a drink in the fridge. While they were gone, I decided to give them a taste. “I’ve never tasted anything remotely similar before. I’d have to be sure that I was in the right state for it.”</p> <p>“Well, we’ll take it slow and we can practice every day.” They both laughed. I’m not sure if they were joking or just joking, but I thought this night was definitely going to happen. “I guess it’s your turn now…”—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
