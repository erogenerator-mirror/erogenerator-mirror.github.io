I grinned.</p> <p>"I am sorry that we have to be so honest about things," she began.</p> <p>"You're not sorry," I said, nodding. "You're not sorry I'm here with you, and the time is right."</p> <p>She smiled. She'd made me forget all about the first time she'd just come inside, of course, but I was able to find a new meaning to that. I wanted to ask her if she liked being able to talk to me like this. To see if that might give her something that she couldn't say the way she came home. To see what could make me happier with her than the life she had already lead. I don't know what she wanted from me.</p> <p>I thought for her. I wasn't sure what she did have in her. I did have feelings for her. Maybe that was what she wanted, but I didn't know for sure.</p> <p>"I don't know what I want," she eventually said, sitting down again.</p> <p>"You're happy," I said, and this time the smile I was wearing was on her face.</p> <p>She nodded, and I decided to try to make things more comfortable for her then.</p> <p>"Thank you," she said after a moment.</p> <p>"No," I said, and I gave her a soft kiss. "Thank you for not giving me to anyone else."</p> <p>"I didn't mean to," she said. "But you're right. I'm still worried about you. I'm not happy about it. But if it makes you happy or miserable or whatever, it would be okay, not a big deal."</p> <p>"Yeah, but if it made you happy, then what's wrong with me?" I asked.</p> <p>"It doesn't," she said. I could tell by the tone of her voice that she wasn't thinking.</p> <p>"Well, the last time I was with a boyfriend," I began. "When we broke up, I don't know what brought it into it. So I guess I just made a mistake. If I'm sorry, then let me be."</p> <p>"You're sorry, you need to let it out, you can't change things now, no matter how much they hurt you," she added.</p> <p>She was right. I could have easily been wrong or just not sure, but I wasn't in the mood for the pain of the other. For one, I didn't want to give her what she needed. Because I felt guilty. And because of the hurt in my heart, maybe if I could make it out and then move on, she wouldn't get hurt as bad as she had been.</p> <p>"I'm not sorry that you're here," I said into her ear. "I'm not sorry for how you've been treating me. I'm not sorry for how you just started talking to me. But I'm not. I'm not sorry that you are here. If you say you don't like me, I'll let you go."</p> <p>With those words, she leaned over and kissed me.</p> <p>I could tell she was nervous, and she didn't exactly know what to make of that. It took me all of two seconds to convince her of that.</p> <p>"I have a lot of feelings for you," she said. "I'm not ready to take the burden off so soon and take everything on account. I mean, I'd like to do that, but you'd have to be ready for it too."</p> <p>"I know," I said.</p> <p>"But don't blame yourself," she added, and kissed me again. "Besides, I think I was just being honest with you. I meant it in every way except for a small one."</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I admitted.</p> <p>"I've never known anything like this," she said. Then she put her hands on my shoulders and pushed me gently forward.</p> <p>"I am so sorry," she said. "I didn't mean to say this, I really shouldn't. Please believe me, that I am sorry. I'm sorry that I haven't told you about being with just anyone. I am so ashamed."</p> <p>"I understand," I said. "It made me so happy."</p> <p>"And I meant all of this too, but I had to tell you one more time," she said. She looked down at her hands.</p> <p>"I really shouldn't have done that," I muttered. "I'm just not that good, and you're so beautiful."</p> <p>She stared at me, surprised.</p> <p>"I wasn't trying to be bad," I told her. "I meant to tell you some things, so I can try to change the path that I'mâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
