I like a lot of things that feel like that..."</p> <p>"That's how I feel..." she said looking up at him. Her hand was still stroking his cock, "I can't help but wonder...what is it that makes you do that?"</p> <p>"Well, it's not like I'm a one-track hypnotist."</p> <p>Dina put her head down on the pillow and smiled up at him before looking back at him. "What do you mean?" she said with a wry grin.</p> <p>"What does it make you?"</p> <p>"Well, I can't really describe it," she said, "what it makes me is different from anything else. It's not what you can do. It's not what you can do. It's just...that it's very..."</p> <p>"Achingly beautiful."</p> <p>"Thank you," she smiled.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Oh...nothing in particular," she said.</p> <p>"Well, for starters, it doesn't make you have sex. So can you give me a blowjob instead?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Good. Because as I said, you know what you want to do right?" she asked.</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"I think...you know...put a cock in your mouth and suck on it like you would a lollipop."</p> <p>"Now, can you really?"</p> <p>"Of course. You want me to do whatever you want me to do...don't you?" he asked.</p> <p>Dina looked up from sucking his long, hard cock. "Oh yes..." she sighed.</p> <p>"Good. Because I know what you want. I'm not going to say anything else...just know that you will be pleased if I do that for you someday."</p> <p>She thought for a moment, "I think that's a wonderful idea."</p> <p>They were both still laying on their sides, with Dina on top of him. "Do you like it when I kiss you?" he asked.</p> <p>She looked up from sucking on his cock, "What kind of questions?"</p> <p>"Just...if you'd rather if I didn't feel what I like?"</p> <p>She smiled, "I guess not. Maybe we both will have to do that, but right now I want to be on top for a bit. If you're uncomfortable, just say so before I do."</p> <p>"Oh, you want me to lie on the bed?"</p> <p>Dina's face reddened as she thought about the question. "Yes," she said, "if you want to."</p> <p>"Good. I'd like that," he said, smiling. As she watched his hands and cock flex, he continued to grin. "Well, we'll see." She had no doubt that he was serious about having sex. He was just saying so that he thought that was a bit funny. She felt her eyebrows tickling her forehead as she considered what he was doing with his answer. She was still pretty good at the art of talking. She had to be. So why go in that direction? She turned and went back to sucking on her boyfriend's cock.</p> <p>"Now...you don't mind if I just fuck you right do you?" he asked with a laugh.</p> <p>"I would be happy," she said, "and if you ever feel uncomfortable, just say so."</p> <p>"You're making it sound kind of clinical," he smiled. After giving her a bit of a rest, he rolled her back onto her stomach. Dina was not so sure how to react to his proposition, so she just looked up at him in a questioning way. He smiled and asked, "Can you really do that for me?"</p> <p>"Of course. Of course I can," she said, "and if I do it for you, I promise it will mean many things to me." She thought for a moment, "How about if I take my top off so that the guys can see me do it?" She turned over and sat up, facing him. He got the hint quickly enough and quickly unbuttoned her top. With both hands, he pulled her top and bra down to expose her ample breasts. She felt silly at first, knowing that she was exposing them. After she was naked, she felt really foolish. She wondered what she was getting into. She would find out soon enough. She wanted him to think that she was just playing it off. Maybe some way to play this kind of game?</p> <p>"Are you sure you want to do it?" she asked.</p> <p>"I would like to," heâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
