She was not an experienced lesbian, but rather had been with others than my daughter. We fucked whenever and wherever we could, and I enjoyed it from her; not just because of the experience, which I now felt no discomfort in her or our relationship, but because we were both so happy to be together. I am now not so much sure if we should continue seeing each other. In the meantime, I had other women for her.</p> <p>I never thought I was going to get around to fucking that woman for myself, even if I was at least one minute away. But my heart was made up.</p> <p>One night we were in a secluded part of the beach. We had just come back from a cruise together. It was a beautiful afternoon and the heat was rising in the cove. The water was cold but I was feeling good. I had just stripped off my shorts when I felt a hand caressing my balls.</p> <p>I turned to see a cute, young girl in a bikini. She had a sun-bleached blonde hair that looked like it had caught the summer morning. Her breasts were small -- hardly any of them. Her tummy, below, was tiny too.</p> <p>"Hi." I greeted her and stood up. "Can I help you?"</p> <p>"I'm sorry, David?" she asked, "My name is Amanda. I came down to join a friend earlier today. My friend Jim is a friend."</p> <p>"We will just swim for a few minutes." I agreed. She looked over at me and I found it incredibly sexy. I took her hand and put it on my shoulder and led her under the water.</p> <p>I could see Amanda's body and I couldn't help but make the comment. "Amanda, I'm sorry but it looks as if we won't be able to swim long." I was thinking that perhaps I should tell Amanda that Amanda needed to do it, even though she looked nervous that I might see her, that she would be embarrassed. I thought that such a bold request might get Amanda even more aroused. "But I guess it looks as though you might get into it."</p> <p>I led Amanda to the shallow end of the pool so she would not be at risk from splashing into the water. She swam over to a spot which was nearby and then stood with her back to me. I reached forward and put my hand on her lower back.</p> <p>"Amanda," I said into her ear, as I began to play with her back. "Do you want to try this?"</p> <p>"Mmm hmm," Amanda moaned.</p> <p>I moved my hand from her back down to her waist and began to lift her onto the pool deck. She followed, moving to one side so that I could reach her lower body. I lifted her up into the pool and she put her feet up at the bottom. I lifted the bottom of her bikini with both hands and slowly peeled it away from her. I leaned forward to kiss her stomach as I lifted her legs. When I lowered her back onto the lounger, Amanda closed her eyes and sighed.</p> <p>When I dropped her down onto the lounge, Amanda spread her legs for me. I put her legs over my shoulders and leaned forward between them. Amanda reached down and took hold of my dick and began to softly stroke it.</p> <p>"I haven't given you a chance to fuck me yet," she whispered.</p> <p>"We might be able to if you want it that way." I said. "But that's up to you." She nodded and then leaned back up to watch.</p> <p>I was working my way up Amanda's legs, my hand moving up to caress her stomach and the soft skin at the junction between her legs. Once again, her body was beautiful and I enjoyed being there beside her. Amanda was a pretty blonde. Her body was perfect -- with just the slight tan lines, and just enough that I was certain we would not be mistaken between my daughter's legs, that she was in a bikini, and that she was ready to fuck. She had nice breasts that were very firm, and her skin was smooth. I caressed her breasts and she responded in kind by taking my hand between her legs and placing it between her. Amanda's body felt like silk.</p> <p>I leaned my head up just low enough to kiss Amanda lightly. My tongue slid inside her mouth and she opened her mouth slightly to accept my tongue. I began to kiss and lick her neck, as her hands went down to stroke my dick. She moved her hips and helped me with me between her legs. She moaned as she felt the precum oozing from me. Our fingers stroked and massaged each other's sex as I worked my way up Amanda's thighs. By the time our lips parted Amanda's lips were glistening.</p> <p>"Can I kiss you?" Amanda asked, kissing meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
