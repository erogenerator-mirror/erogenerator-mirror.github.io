She couldn't see his face but her breasts could.</p> <p>"He wants us," said Julie.</p> <p>"Yes. He wants us too." She looked over to where my head was at the end of the table. "He's had it up my ass. I don't think he's ever seen that before and he's been asking me for the chance to." She was looking at all three men now. She was shocked to see that there were four guys now on the table. "I think we can do with a little more foreplay."</p> <p>"That'd really go down too well," said Julie, "not to mention the chance of getting my cherry ass fucked at the same time. That's not fair. I think they'd like that too."</p> <p>They all turned around to look at me. My ass was right there, but the cock that they were all looking at was not in my hand. Julie said, "I think maybe that's as big as mine. Can I join you for a minute?"</p> <p>"Oh," said David. He sat down next to me. "I'll fuck you," he said. The others all laughed at that. Both of them stood by the table.</p> <p>"I'd be really mad if your dick was stuck up my asshole," said Julie. She stood up, the guys standing around her, and reached down to hold it. I turned around and felt her hand on my dick. She was looking at me while she worked it.</p> <p>"You're so big," said Julie. She felt some pre-cum coming out of the tip. She leaned down and licked it off when it came out. It didn't take long for me to cum. She started jerking me off as my dick was shooting its cum all over my belly and chest. When the spurts stopped, she gave me a kiss.</p> <p>"Oh, shit!" said Julie. She looked over at me. I was sitting back just a little, trying to hold my dick in place. She said, "I can't believe I did that. I never even considered that."</p> <p>"I guess you don't," said David.</p> <p>"But I've been fantasizing about giving a hand job," said Julie. She looked at me and smiled. "Well, maybe I can do something to fulfill the fantasy."</p> <p>"Yeah?" said David. "If you want to try it." I don't know where Julie got her courage. Did I?</p> <p>"What you see's what you get," said Julie. "When is it and where?"</p> <p>"In about three weeks," said David. "I expect to have a talk with one or two of the guys on Monday. You better take the afternoon off and do whatever you normally do while I'm away. Don't stay up late or you'll get a stiffy."</p> <p>"OK," said Julie. "I'll let you see then." Her arms hung around me as we hugged. I looked over at Julie, who was staring at me with her eyebrows raised. She reached up and placed her hands on my forehead. "Now, David," she said. "I want you to take me home. I've wanted to have all of that cock up me all day. I don't care if any of the other guys want to fuck you right now."</p> <p>"OK," I said. I'd never done anything like Julie said I should be doing. "I'm not sure if I can go."</p> <p>Julie started laughing. "Let's go," she said. "I'm sure you can find other women that I've been with that would give you a run for your money. Just know that if you do it, it's nothing compared to what it will get you. We've all had a little experience with things like that. I wouldn't want to put that all away."</p> <p>"Maybe I can do that," I said. "I've been with a lot of women already." She hugged me again. "Not sure how much I'm even getting out of it." I reached over and grabbed her hand. The hands holding her hand were big enough to be pretty solid. I let go for a minute, just to feel her soft arm. "If it gets you anything, it's worth it. I'll give you anything you want."</p> <p>"Thanks, David," she said. "You're a special man." I'm sure she kissed him again.</p> <p>The hand on her pussy was over in just a few seconds. The one in my hand, too. We kissed some more. Julie was breathing hard.</p> <p>"You're a special man," she said.</p> <p>We sat down again. "Let's go do some shopping," said Julie. â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
