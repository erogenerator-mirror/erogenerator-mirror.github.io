That was more than a little weird, too, wasn't it? After all, no-one had to know.</p> <p>"Okay, how about you get me a drink, too?"</p> <p>"Sure, honey." She handed me a bottle of beer and sat next to me, sipping. "Here," she said as she gestured to the pitcher, "I'll go get it while I get us something to eat."</p> <p>"How long is that going to take?" I asked nervously.</p> <p>"My stomach's about to burst when I come back," she said, "it's been almost three and a half hours since dinner.</p> <p>"I see," I said with a start. She seemed a bit more anxious to say I was about to drink now, but then added, "You know the guy from your office?"</p> <p>"Yes," I replied, thinking. It was one of the most exciting experiences of my life, I thought. She's a good girl, too. I've never said I found the whole thing kind of weird or anything, but there's always been something inside my head that says, 'hey, just hang on a minute, you know, let's do it,' I guess. At least, I used to think it was, until one day I tried a girl.</p> <p>"Her boyfriend, Jim, took it pretty far."</p> <p>"What? Jim's what?" I asked, genuinely puzzled but somewhat incredulous.</p> <p>"My boyfriend Jim, if you're interested in having a relationship with him, please don't say anything about this. He's a lousy guy, but it seems that he's a good fit for you. We were talking, though."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"And?"</p> <p>"Well, I think that this will give us the opportunity to get a little wild in our bed."</p> <p>"Yeah, sure."</p> <p>I sipped my beer as we talked, and the fact that she continued to be friendly made the experience even more exciting. The topic of Jim had turned me on more and more as the evening went on, but I still wondered what my reaction would be after we finished our drinks. "So what do you think?" she asked as we started heading back to the house.</p> <p>"It's a different town."</p> <p>"Does Jim live here?"</p> <p>"No, my work is in Pittsburgh."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Yes. I mean, my work's in Pittsburgh."</p> <p>"It was just..."</p> <p>"Just where?" I asked, "It's not what you think." Then, realizing that I should have felt guilty about it earlier, after all, I was still feeling very turned on. "I mean, I kind of figured, all this time, that there's going to be two couples hanging out in this town. And, well, I've never had a more memorable experience with two people that I know."</p> <p>She smiled a warm smile and stood up to hug me again. This time, though, she put her arms around me as she pressed up against me. I felt her warm body, pressing against mine, and I felt my lips brush against her neck, her throat, her collarbone. I knew I shouldn't, of course, but somehow I did. I felt all tingly at the mere thought of the evening, and I felt as if my body was trying to tell me more than just how it felt to be kissing my best friend.</p> <p>Her kiss felt good, really good, as I felt her lips gently touch one cheek of my face, her nose brushing against my stubbly chin. I felt the lips against my temple, softly kissing my jaw. "That was nice." I murmured in response.</p> <p>"You taste incredible," she said, "and I can't thank you enough for sharing the experience." She kissed my face again, this time running a trail of tiny kisses down my chin, taking special care to not touch my lips just yet. She lingered at the top of my jaw but this time, when she got to where her chin touched my neck, she took the hair from my face and carefully brushed her tongue across my skin, tracing the small lines of my cheek.</p> <p>When she finally came to rest at my lips, we were in a deep and meaningful kiss, both of us struggling to maintain composure. Finally, we broke to catch our breath, and she released her grip from me and stood up. "That was nice," she said, "but I have one of my own planned."</p> <p>"What are you talking about?"</p> <p>"Wellâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
