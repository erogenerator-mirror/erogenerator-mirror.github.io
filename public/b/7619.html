It's my man, Dave, the one with the black hair and the silver eyes!"</p> <p>"Yeah. He's been trying to hook me up with him for the longest time."</p> <p>Melody started talking about a number of times before her little 'I'm going to give you my number for your trouble' remark came to mind, but instead of bringing it up again, she looked him dead in the eye and slowly looked back at the pictures, letting her eyes linger on his body for a moment before turning to her mom.</p> <p>"That should be interesting!"</p> <p>"Yeah, but I still can't quite believe it!"</p> <p>"You might as well find the place I go for the rest of the week and make up for it, don't you?"</p> <p>"Yeah, well, what if your dad wasn't there when you did it? What if your dad was sitting in the family room with the hottest female model in school right next door?" He raised an eyebrow, and started to blush.</p> <p>"Maybe I could find a girl to do it with."</p> <p>"Don't just drop your panties!"</p> <p>"I'm sorry, honey."</p> <p>Melody sighed happily, and smiled.</p> <p>"So what'd I miss?"</p> <p>"Honey, you missed it because I found your mom and your dad and I was going to call them and tell them I just had a birthday surprise for you, and it was a good thing the weekend was almost over," she said with a smile as the line went dead.</p> <p>She was sitting there with her back to the wall and she could hear the sound of her mother's heels on the stairs. She was just about to come back up when she saw the woman of her dreams come walking out the door. Even though Melody had to sneak back home, she couldn't get the woman out of her head. She started to get up off the floor so she could put an end to Melody's thoughts. She turned to walk home and when she was walking, the woman who had helped move the pictures out of her head turned from the doorway.</p> <p>"Hey!" she exclaimed, looking up at her mother. "How was your week?" the woman asked sarcastically.</p> <p>"It's alright, Mom," Melody replied. "I got to see the pictures again and was still kind of in awe of how awesome they were, especially as to the guy in them."</p> <p>"Wow," was all the woman said without looking at Melody.</p> <p>Melody looked back at her mother then back at the pictures on the ground, feeling a little better. "Thanks," she said softly before walking over to the picture.</p> <p>As she walked over to the computer, the memory of her mom smiling and watching her work, popped up. Melody looked it over for a moment before finding the picture of her and Dave at the time, and she slowly clicked it, and found herself wishing again and again for her to get rid of the woman who had given her the shock she had, and she was glad she wasn't having to worry about it as she walked home. She looked at the picture and she had a sinking feeling in her stomach that she would never see her again, but it seemed the woman who had handed her the picture was going to be her. She picked up where she left off, but as Melody clicked on the picture, she couldn't help but smile a little. Suddenly it was like she couldn't wait till the week when they would meet. Melody knew it was time.</p> <p>"Honey, you can get back up now," her mom finally spoke. "Why don't you go and put on something sexy while I fix dinner," Melody asked.</p> <p>Melody didn't know why she was talking, but it felt like an eternity as she walked her mother to the door where her friend was waiting, and she didn't need to even give her a once over. They walked to the door and Melody closed it as she unlocked it, and turned off the light before locking it back into it and getting an erection from the awkwardness of her first time. She took off her coat and hung it up on an empty hook by the door. She walked to her purse and picked it up, but it ended up with the bottom of it in her hands, so she started to fold it and put it on her dresser, when she heard her mother call her name out from the hall.</p> <p>"Hey, honey," she called back. "Have you ever been to see a couple of my friends?"</p> <p>"Uh, no."</p> <p>"Well," Melody continued after giving her friend a chance to answer. "Have you seen them?"</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Well," she continued.
