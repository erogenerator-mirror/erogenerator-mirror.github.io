It really should be free for you."</p> <p>She grabbed a small plate from the side table and a plastic cup, and walked through the door, holding it out to me. "Here, you need to eat. All of it."</p> <p>I nodded. This might turn out to be a great weekend. I'd have to call my Aunt and see how the plans are going. They may try and find me a job, but if that's enough I'll have to do something nice for a little money.</p> <p>As we ate breakfast, Aunt Jean opened up. "So you're doing all your friends a favour, huh?"</p> <p>"Yes. I did have to get some help, but I'm alright."</p> <p>"There's more, you know."</p> <p>I was confused. The idea that anyone could help at all, with no food or money, might not seem so great. And with what had happened in the café, didn't Aunt Jean want to see me upset? I nodded. "Well, I can't promise I won't do anything. I just need some food to sleep."</p> <p>"I can give you something to sleep in."</p> <p>"You're kidding. There's no other option."</p> <p>Her eyes narrowed. "Is this what you want?"</p> <p>"Don't worry. It's nothing really, and I'll take care of everything else..."</p> <p>Tears started to leak out, a mixture of fear and excitement. "I've never done anything like this before, thank God!"</p> <p>"It's okay, there's nothing to be scared of. You aren't going to be a virgin."</p> <p>I couldn't believe I was agreeing to do this. I was so excited all I cared about was the pleasure, the feeling of being with Aunt Jean.</p> <p>"How are we going to get the food to your room this time?"</p> <p>"By the way. You can get it to the cafe with the bathroom next door, and we'll call the next place and have an open line by the car until you get it, and we can go back to our house and start a new life together."</p> <p>"Great. Okay. I'll do my best."</p> <p>We finished up the food then I went to a bathroom that was next door and got up to find something to wash down the dishes. The rest of my day was like that, there were no other options. The money was great, and no one would bother me. In the meantime Aunt Jean, with the help of some other girls, had arranged a group party for me the following Friday.</p> <p>Aunt Jean had organised the trip with help from the girls. For a bit they were a big group of girls, with a lot of sex, so I had a number of friends that lived with me and the other girls for the most part. Also the girls were very discreet, and it didn't take a lot of guys to know what happened, and what was going to happen during the party. The last thing they would want that to do was to go too far, with one girl. And if you were with the other girl, it was going to take longer for the guy to get into her. It's easy to be the jealous type, but it works both ways.</p> <p>I found two very happy looking men that were the type that had lots of girls following them around, so when things didn't go as planned the night went extremely well. One man, I think Aunt Jean guessed he was, walked over to me and started to run her hands over my chest. At first I didn't take it at all, but before I could say anything again I found myself having my nipples pinched. It felt great, to have her touch them. Soon I started to feel a real need for her.</p> <p>"I think we should go get a drink," she said, in a voice that brooked no argument. "Here, get me one."</p> <p>As I handed her a drink and started to walk away from her, she stopped in the doorway just before I got across the room. My jeans were tight, and I'm sure she could have found a way to get a good look. It looked as good as it felt, as if every inch of her body, every inch of her skin, had been touching its way to being touched.</p> <p>"What? Are you going to join us?" she said, stepping forward, still wearing that little smile.</p> <p>"Just a minute," I replied, getting up myself to put away the glass. It was going to be a long night, and I'm sure the men and ladies would be having a lot of fun.</p> <p>We sat on the sofa and finished—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
