"But I'd also want to have a place to stay. Mom says we should have a room in town tomorrow, right?"</p> <p>"I think we're ready for another honeymoon," I said, a little worried about Mike.</p> <p>"Are you kidding?" he asked, shaking his head. "It would be nice to stay with you on a first honeymoon.</p> <p>Mike shook his head. "I wasn't sure about you."</p> <p>The tension between us was palpable. I couldn't keep my hands off of Mike.</p> <p>After we finished breakfast - no more coffee for us - I took his hand and led us out the door to our hotel room. Mike said he'd be fine the next day, but I assured him the next day was too soon for him to want a second honeymoon.</p> <p>We climbed into bed; I fell asleep in his arms, and I heard him fall asleep shortly thereafter.</p> <p>For whatever reason, I fell asleep with a sense of apprehension. It was as if my heart wasn't beating like it should be. It didn't feel good. I couldn't really sleep. I was completely confused.</p> <p>I woke the next morning to the sun shining through my bedroom window. I turned out the light and stretched to get the sleep that I craved. I pulled the sheet over my face.</p> <p>As I sat up in the bed, I wondered exactly what that meant. In my head, I thought of Mike, and then what he must have meant. The implications, the consequences, my confusion, my concern - it all was a bit too much at once.</p> <p>I went to the mirror to be sure I looked good and looked my best. I went down the hall to the mirror - my eyes were still blurry from sleep. I looked down my body and saw that my dick was tenting the sheet in anticipation of morning freedom.</p> <p>As I walked along the hall, I saw Michael standing at the door to my suite, his feet still up on the desk. He was completely naked. I smiled. It was his first day with the beach. I couldn't wait.</p> <p>I saw Mike walk to the bed, his erect cock standing straight out from his body. He leaned down, still on the bed. He kissed my neck. Then he began to lower his lips to my chest. I felt his warm breath wash over me, and his body, and his lips. His lips were on my nipples. I moaned involuntarily. He kissed my abdomen, the soft hairs on my chest, and then he moved down to the V of my thigh.</p> <p>I was in ecstasy just from the feel of his lips on my skin. My hands were all over the place. My body was alive with electricity. Mike kissed, licked, and sucked on my body. By the time it was his turn to kiss me, I was fully awake, my hands fumbling ineffectually over my throbbing hard dick. I knew it was time for another show.</p> <p>My hands were all over Mike. I stroked and massaged his hairless body while kissing his eyes. I took control of the situation as I explored his body with my hands and kissed his mouth, nibbling his ears. My cock was straining against the front of his Speedo.</p> <p>"Oh God!" Jim's voice startled me. I looked up, startled. I was still in bed. Jim was across the hall, probably asleep from the stress of the day. I heard my son say, "Well, mom, you weren't kidding was you? You made some man very happy last night."</p> <p>I couldn't believe Jim was here. I was confused.</p> <p>Jim said, "Sorry honey, I couldn't believe I was seeing you, mom." As Jim and I watched Mike, Mike reached over and stroked Jim's penis in his hand. Jim moaned in pleasure.</p> <p>Mike's cock was hard and upright in Mike's hand. He looked up at my son, his eyes never leaving Mike's penis.</p> <p>"I'm going to need a bigger pair of underwear," Mike said. Jim giggled.</p> <p>Mike rolled off the bed. In front of me, Jim's cock was still hard. He knelt on the floor. He wrapped his hand around Jim's penis and held him up. Jim grinned at me. Mike lifted Jim's penis up and looked closely at it. His eyes traveled up and down Jim's body. He smiled broadly. When he had finished looking, he lifted Jim's leg in an attempt to get at the crotch of his Speedo before Jim slid it off.</p> <p>Mike sat down on the bed. He put the cock inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
