She groaned and groaned, her hips thrusting back at him. Her eyes bulged as he drove his big dick in and out of her. Her cunt gripped him as he pushed it in and out, rubbing against it with each thrust. He held her by the hips and continued to pound her furiously.</p> <p>Gabby moaned as she came repeatedly, her ass pushing back at him. He pulled out and began ramming his dick in and out, getting faster and faster. She came again, her legs shaking hard. He pounded her again. She screamed and her orgasm went on and on. Finally she fell off of his dick, a little unsteady on her feet. He collapsed on top of her. She put her arms around his neck and smiled, "Oh, baby, I've missed you."</p> <p>His smile, at that moment, vanished, and he pulled her up to cuddle against his body. He kissed her tenderly on the lips. She leaned into him, hugging tighter. He put his arm around her and held her. She lay back down next to him, looking up at him. 'That was wonderful." He reached over to turn off the overhead lights before his parents got home.</p> <p>Gabby laughed and kissed him. He held her closer to him and they lay there silently for a while. She rested her head on his shoulder. He ran his fingers through her hair and kissed her on the cheek.</p> <p>They lay in her bed for a long time talking about all that had happened over the past few weeks. He told her he had made great progress, but he was still unsure about how it would work. She was always the kind of girl who took great pains to make the best for the person. She gave great advice. She'd told him once that it was better to stay with someone, in order to find out what you can from someone else.</p> <p>One night, they were lying in bed spooning. He was stroking her face and rubbing his hand over her breasts. Giggling, she turned her head to kiss him. He rolled on top of her, their stomachs grinding against each other. Her hands ran through his wet hair. She pushed her chest into his and kissed him. Then she rolled over on her back. He ran his fingers over the curve of her breast and down over her abdomen. As he slipped his fingers over her mound, she lifted from the pillow, pressing it into his chest. He kissed her softly, trailing his tongue down her neck. She let out a small moan. He kissed his way down to the hollow of her throat. He licked her skin, and began at the hollow of her throat again, moving slowly downward. His lips pressed against her collarbone and down her chest. He suckled on her breast, softly pulling and gently sucking each nipple. He moved his hand up and down the crevice between her legs, rubbing the moisture there with his fingertips. Gabby began to sigh when his tongue dipped inside of her, slowly moving in and out. She was growing damp.</p> <p>"Baby," he whispered, "I just want you. I don't know what'll come next." He moved to the night stand and sat up so they could look at each other. Her eyes were wet. She kissed him while gently running her fingers over his jaw line.</p> <p>"I want you. I really want you, daddy." She ran her hands down his chest and into his hair. "I've missed you so much. I wanted to be with you the first week and I finally realized that I can't take this chance. I can't even go with you if you decide I'm in no shape to go."</p> <p>He smiled, kissing her back, "Come on Gabby, you know you're in no shape when I think you're in an awful lot of shape. But, if I really want to, I promise you'll always be in a good place." He reached out and ran one finger through her dark hair.</p> <p>"Thank you daddy," she said before kissing his lips. They continued to kiss while he got dressed. He left for the bathroom and walked quickly back to his room. He undressed and got in bed, looking at the clock. It was 10. He took one more minute to finish getting dressed.</p> <p>He put on his jeans and tee shirt and he pulled on a pair of socks and sneakers. He walked to the door. Gabby peeked out at the clock. It read 11:00. She sat up and peeked out her window, noticing that it was only 9. She put her feet up on the coffee table, grabbed a couple of glasses and the paper napkins. She put her feet down.</p> <p>She stoodâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
