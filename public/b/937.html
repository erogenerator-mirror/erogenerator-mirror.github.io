The rest I could work on. The next morning I awoke in bed and he was there next to me. He looked so good and so naked that I had to do something. He’d taken his shirt off and he was sitting on me with his shorts on.</p> <p>I wanted him so bad in that moment I knew I would never get those shorts off. At some point it’s always up to him if he wants it this time and he always seems to be the one who has to take it off. He kissed me gently and went on to strip off his shorts. He stood and pulled his shorts back up. I’m not sure what it was that I found so very appealing, a cock that would have been very hard and huge. It did look pretty good, and so sexy hanging off of him.</p> <p>“Is that all you feel like last night?”</p> <p>“Mmm, maybe but not today.” I smiled and pulled him down and kissed him. He’s very good at making me feel good, I could tell. I knew there was no denying his arousal.</p> <p>He said something like “I thought you were the last man I've had, that you’ll be a last man to me.”</p> <p>“You got me good. Then it’ll never be for the last, especially not with you.”</p> <p>“I don’t know, but maybe we would like to see how you feel about it…”. He laughed and kissed me again.</p> <p>When I came to he said “I’d like to hear how you feel now, it’s not so bad.” His hand was running up and down my body. We kissed and he started to rub my body. His fingers would slide over my nipples and then slowly move down over my stomach, my navel, back up my slit and finally into me. I was beginning to have a feeling of anticipation and a big feeling. After a while his hand moved onto my breasts and he used one to play with my nipple. When he kissed my nipple his finger flicked it and it felt as hard as a marble. Then he flicked it again and then used the other to tease my slit. I couldn’t help myself. I was already wet and he hadn’t done anything but lick me and tease me.</p> <p>He started to finger fuck me slowly, and I could feel his tongue flicking over my clit and around it. His finger went quickly in and out, flicking over it. I moaned as it made me feel as if I was going to go for him, not him. I came very early and he kept rubbing my body and fingering me. His finger moved over my clitty in many different ways. It was a lot different than my previous ones.</p> <p>There was a pause between strokes and he said “I don’t want to go any further then this right now, but I’m so hot I just may explode if you keep touching me that way.”</p> <p>I told him I was feeling really good and kissed him again. When we finished the kiss I felt his finger come out of me again, but this time with more lube, if he took it in it was like sliding a little finger in his mouth. He was grinning when I took it in with my mouth and it slid in easily. The sensations were very different this time and made me even wetter. It was wonderful, but it wasn't everything I realized it would be.</p> <p>I went down on him and slowly, letting him slide onto me, until I’d let out a little moan as a result. As I slid onto him I had to stretch a little to get to the bottom. I could now feel the ridge of his cock rub around my clit, and then back up to the tip of him. I could feel another orgasm coming but I wasn’t ready. I wanted to feel him as deep as I could get. Then I felt the ridge, just right. Again I couldn’t get to the bottom he was so big, and it was a lot easier with out any lube. Before long I felt my juices seeping from me and he was still in my pussy but was starting to move in a little. I thought he was ready…</p> <p>“I want you big—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
