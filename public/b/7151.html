She kissed him again, and his hands began unbuttoning her shirt again. She helped him out of it carefully. His hands were on her breasts. She felt flushed, a bit more so, than she'd been in a long time. She let the shirt drop, leaving her skin bare and exposed, feeling her nipples stiffen under his hands.</p> <p>Jenny's head fell back as the kisses intensified, until she couldn't breathe. Her pussy ached.</p> <p>"Oh, Jenny," Peter moaned when Jenny's mouth descended to kiss her right breast. He suckled it gently, his tongue teasing her nipple, flicking it as her fingers entwined with his hair, pulling it tight.</p> <p>"You know," she sighed. "I can't remember the last time I felt like this."</p> <p>He kissed her other one. He felt her shudder.</p> <p>"Jenny?"</p> <p>She pulled him to her. They clung to each other, both wanting more, and both of them knew they would have to stop this soon. Their eyes closed, their faces buried in each other.</p> <p>"Jenny," Peter muttered. "Jenny."</p> <p>His hands went up and over her bare back, feeling over her spine. He pulled her shirt off, feeling the warm skin beneath it, the small bumps at the base of the vertebrae there. He ran fingertips over her back, along the curve of her spine, across her hips and lower back. He kissed the top of her head.</p> <p>"I have no idea what you're thinking," he whispered.</p> <p>"Don't stop," Jenny breathed.</p> <p>"Not yet. This."</p> <p>"That doesn't mean we can't stop," she said gently as she kissed his forehead. She reached and stroked him, feeling his body tense beneath her. "I love you."</p> <p>"I love you too," Peter said as he kissed her forehead. His lips met hers, and their tongues met and wrestled, exploring each other.</p> <p>He put his arms around her and held her. His kiss was wet, wild. He'd never felt anything like it.</p> <p>"I love you," Jenny said after breaking their kiss.</p> <p>"I love you too," Peter said, kissing her lips even though they were so open. He had the strangest sensation his heart felt as she took him inside of her. She moaned when his fingers caressed her ass. "You didn't tell me you could do it again. You're still so sore."</p> <p>She smiled. "I loved it when you kissed it."</p> <p>"It felt good," He said as he eased her into his lap.</p> <p>"Yeah, but I didn't think that would feel that good. I'm used to it."</p> <p>"You can try," he said, as he kissed her neck. "I love it."</p> <p>"I do," Jenny smiled as Peter nuzzled her.</p> <p>"I like to tell you that sometimes I like to tell you that," he whispered as he kissed her neck. "Sometimes I love to tell you that, too."</p> <p>"I know. So now you're just going to have to love that as well," Jenny said, running her fingers down his face, taking in his features. He looked so cute, his eyes half open, his lips parted as he sighed.</p> <p>"God, you're so beautiful," Jenny said happily as she leaned down, opening her mouth over his and returning his tongue to her. She ran her fingertips through his hair as he sucked the tip of her tongue into his mouth, pulling on it. Then she kissed her way down his body, kissing his stomach, the skin just under the waistline of his shorts.</p> <p>"Ah!" he gasped when she licked the underside of his shaft. She stroked him with one hand as she kissed the tip of his cock.</p> <p>"Jenny!" he moaned.</p> <p>"You have no idea," she said as her lips surrounded his head.</p> <p>She bobbed her head slowly, feeling him push into her throat each time she took him deeper. When she felt his thighs begin to shake, she took him out from her mouth, the first time she'd ever deep throated him.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," he said.</p> <p>"Don't be," she said. "I want to hear you say it."</p> <p>"I love how you're always thinking of me when you suck me."</p> <p>She kissed down his shaft, feeling him swell and pulsate as it hit the back of her throat. He was already a little wet from her sucking on him, as much so as from his own. His body felt like a tight ball of muscle, like it was trying to keep him in. Then she felt him swell even more as he pressed deeperâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
