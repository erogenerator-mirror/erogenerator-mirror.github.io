While slowly leaning across him, she brought one of her hands up his stomach, slowly creeping under his shirt, running up his ribs. Feeling his flesh beneath her fingers she traced along them, and he moaned softly. She slid her hand down into his jeans and began to massage him, feeling his body shiver underneath her. She let her hand slip out, and she slowly brought it behind himself to rest against her neck and shoulder. Looking back up at him she softly whispered, "Come on, I want you inside me." Looking down at her she started to feel down his shorts, his cock was hard as a rock and straining through the fabric. She brought the fingers up to meet his stomach, and slowly moved her legs farther apart, causing his bulging cock to push up against her legs. She looked up at him, and said hoarsely, "Oh, yeah!" He gave his head a shake of appreciation and he bent down toward her. She leaned back against the wall in the hallway.</p> <p>He pushed his shorts down, his cock springing free, its head pointing straight up. Licking his lips he gave his cock a teasing tug, "No, wait! I'm not really ready yet." She stepped away from the wall. With that she walked over to another chair that was at the end of the hallway. Taking her time she slowly walked toward him, her breasts bouncing slightly off of her shirt as she walked. Finally standing in front of him she lifted her shirt over her head, revealing her naked breasts. She looked him up and down, noting his eyes travel slowly down from her feet to her eyes, and then back up. Turning around she looked back over her shoulder.</p> <p>"What the hell?" He looked back at her and grinned when he saw she was looking him over.</p> <p>"What's wrong?" She asked. Moving over next to him, she held his hands and gently laid herself down on his lap.</p> <p>"I don't think I'm up to watching this right now." He replied. Feeling his cock grow harder against her thigh she gently nudged it forward, and he gasped in excitement. Turning around as if to say something, she placed his hands on her breasts, squeezing gently. Bending to face him her lips parted and she breathed, "Honey, do a little more than just watch, because I don't have all night." She paused for a second and then gave his eyes the eye-lids.</p> <p>"Is it that you didn't like the way I looked, I'm still not completely certain you really need to see me?" She asked. His breathing quickened again, and the corner of his mouth turned up in a smile.</p> <p>"That depends." He replied.</p> <p>"What is?" She asked, slowly looking back up at him.</p> <p>"Well, a lot depends. I'm not sure when I'll start to notice you...I'm not sure where I'll start to notice you, but here," he said as he lightly caressed her cheek. He leaned over and kissed her lips softly, feeling his cock begin to rub up against her leg. He gently pulled back from her and sat back on his heels.</p> <p>Sitting there, she looked down at his cock. It looked as hard as rock, and almost twitching at the sight of her. She slowly stroked it gently, watching his face as he watched her. His cock began to jerk to her touch. Looking down she was pleased to see that she could have handled just about everything he did to her at that moment.</p> <p>"Why is it that every man seems to have a weakness for my breasts." She said, slightly flustered.</p> <p>"Well, no man really wants to be able to see them." He responded. He reached out and ran his hand over her stomach, feeling over it as well. Feeling his cock grow harder underneath she moved over until she was sitting on his lap. She started to move her hips back and forth slowly, her eyes never leaving his.</p> <p>He leaned his head around and put his arms around her waist. He leaned back over her, and kissed her mouth passionately. She reached behind and began to roll her hips and grind herself up against him. Suddenly feeling his weight on top of her, she reached down and pushed him off of her. "Honey I need to ask you something." she said.</p> <p>"What is it?" He asked nervously. He had always been scared to ask her anything for fear he would be accused of being an idiot. It terrified him that she probably wouldn't want to see him naked and to know that she might leave him if he did.</p> <p>"You know how we talk about things, I'll tell you whatever you want me to." He smiled and leaned forward, kissing her softlyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
