Hey," came her reply.</p> <p>A thought popped into my head. I looked down at the sheet, where she had laid the blanket out on the bed, and it was still covering both of us.</p> <p>"Um..." I stalled for an answer.</p> <p>"I'm not...I don't want you to feel embarrassed if you were naked or dressed before." She said. Then her voice was husky. "It's ok if you're naked."</p> <p>"I'm not."</p> <p>"No you're not." She said again.</p> <p>I was still trying to get my mind to not think about the possibility of the events I had just witnessed. I was still trying to figure out what had just happened, so I wasn't looking at her right now. I was still trying to remember if there was a chance of us having some kind of relationship. Maybe we were just both adults.</p> <p>"How about you and I get naked first. Then you can show me?"</p> <p>"Um...ok," was her answer.</p> <p>"Ok." Was out of the question.</p> <p>So we dressed and I put my towel with us. I put on her top, which came over almost perfectly. She put on mine and we were both standing there in only our nightshirts. It was still warm in the hallway.</p> <p>"Nice," I said, as I looked at the nightshirt's color. It came down around her hips and she was braless.</p> <p>"Thank you," she said, blushing. "You are absolutely beautiful too."</p> <p>I noticed she spoke so quickly, and she said her thing with every word. It took a while for our clothes to dry, but soon we had returned to our rooms. I stripped down to my boxers and I was out the door in record time. The lights had finally come on, but it was still dark out. I could see her room from where I was, but I couldn't see anything of her. My heart slowed as I climbed the stairs. My heart was pounding. I wanted to run away. My cock was throbbing inside my shorts. I could hear the sound of her room as she climbed the stairs. She opened her bedroom door. Oh what will I do? I thought. What if I run? Should I just stay there and let it happen?</p> <p>"Hello?" she said in a very soft voice.</p> <p>I could hear the sound of a door shut next to my bed. I was frozen in my tracks. I could hear her breathing in and out. It wasn't a whisper, it was coming from her in my mind. I couldn't believe she was still there. I was standing under her covers looking at her beautiful breasts encased in a white nightshirt. I knew she looked at my hands which were rubbing them gently.</p> <p>"Come on in," she said again. "It's really nice that we've got some light in the room."</p> <p>The first thing I noticed was her body that was revealed from her nightshirt. It was a little shorter than I had imagined. It wasn't a thin line like you'd imagine. But I could see that it was barely covering something underneath. Her face was covered by only the thin fabric of the robe. It was a soft pink with a thin line running the middle of her forehead and a thin line from her shoulder bone on her neck. It was so thin you could see her hair, but it didn't look as if it was all that obvious.</p> <p>"Is there some room for one there? I'm kind of cramped. Will you come in and share the covers with me?" She asked again.</p> <p>I couldn't move or speak. I couldn't do anything. It was so sudden that I nearly tripped over myself as I sat down on my bed, completely mesmerized by her body. Her breasts were so much bigger than any other woman I had ever seen, and I couldn't believe their size. There was a little curve to them just barely visible beneath the fabric. My cock was straining inside my boxers. I could feel it throbbing. I was staring at two of the most beautiful girls in my life. I couldn't believe the excitement I felt there was something there. I could feel everything. Her hair was so thick, and I just knew she couldn't cover anything. I was looking at her legs. They seemed to have crossed the floor. There were very long legs running up the side of the bed. Their shape was perfect, like the most perfect body shape. They had to be as long as I remembered hers. And her arms. They were long and graceful as she moved them up her body. The way her skin felt when her hands came down to cover her shoulders.</p> <p>I stood still forâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
