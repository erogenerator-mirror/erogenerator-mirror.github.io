He smiled again, feeling her wet tongue on his. She stopped kissing him long enough to lift off, and then slide around on his lap. Her bare feet on the chair, and he sat up, pulling her down with him. Her ass rested on his lap, her wet pussy grinding against his semi hard cock.</p> <p>"Fuck" he breathed as she began to grind and gyrate. "You feel so good."</p> <p>"So fucking good." she whispered, her mouth sliding up and down his face then on his chin.</p> <p>When they finally came to an armchair with a soft black and blue recliner in the center, he lay her back down on the armrests. Her eyes glistened against the green light, and she leaned back onto the chair, opening her legs, offering him full access to her sex.</p> <p>Jason's body quivered for her touch, she moved her hand over him, rubbing her finger up and down the underside of his shaft. She leaned forward to wrap her lips around the head of his cock.</p> <p>"Let me." he whispered into her ear, as his hips slid into her hand.</p> <p>"No, I want to," she said softly as she lifted her knees up to rest them on his hips, giving him even greater access to her. As his cock slid easily into her, Jason pushed up against her, lifting his hips so that his cock would glide just past her g-spot.</p> <p>"Ohhhhh, god, yes." She moaned as he slid into her.</p> <p>And Jason responded, thrusting himself deeper inside of her, her body arching under him as he continued moving inside her. Suddenly, she arched her back, lifting her hips with him with each downward thrust. The motion of her orgasm against his cock triggered his own and he thrust one more time, burying himself inside her. The sounds echoed around them as Jason growled and slammed into her, burying himself within her.</p> <p>He came, his own orgasm coming within seconds, as his shaft pumped a massive load into her. His muscles locked in pleasure as he continued to drive into her, his orgasm still in force, filling the small apartment. He rested his head on top of hers and kissed her neck, her breath catching in his ear and sending shivers down his spine.</p> <p>They lay in silence for a moment.</p> <p>"That was..."</p> <p>"Amazing." she said, her fingers caressing his cheek. Her fingertips traced his lips.</p> <p>"Better than amazing." he grinned as he kissed his way down her chest, leaving a trail across her stomach.</p> <p>"I am going to fuck you until the day I die." he breathed against her, giving her a wink.</p> <p>"Good." she said as he kissed it again.</p> <p>When he finished kissing her belly she sat up.</p> <p>"You didn't." she said as he helped her sit on the chair. "It feels as though we have been talking about something."</p> <p>"It's been a difficult day, and the people at Columbia are treating us horribly." Jason said, putting her to bed.</p> <p>"I'm sorry that I didn't get to spend that long." she admitted, her lips brushing his ear.</p> <p>"You won't regret it." He said as he climbed off the bed.</p> <p>She smiled, laying down on the chair near him.</p> <p>"Well, I will," she agreed.</p> <p>"Wait." he said as he grabbed her under the arm.</p> <p>"I had something to tell you." he said, sitting on the bed, waiting for her.</p> <p>She stared at him, the tension in the air broken as he spoke to her. "I'm a vampire." she said, nodding when she saw his look change into something else. As if it could tell her that something else was on the horizon at some point.</p> <p>"What do you mean?" she asked cautiously.</p> <p>"I'm a vampire. I met a vampire and then, when they don't want me they change me. It's all good, because then I'd end up losing your body."</p> <p>The expression in her eyes told him there was more, if that was possible. He smiled at her.</p> <p>"You know that's not true."</p> <p>"But you are different." she admitted, trying to be sure.</p> <p>His eyes were a dark, stormy gray, and they burned with energy.</p> <p>"So, you know." he said lightly, his dark gaze focused above her.</p> <p>"Of course." she agreed.</p> <p>He looked at her in a deep and dangerous way.
