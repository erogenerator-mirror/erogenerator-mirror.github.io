I moved my hand from the back of his legs, to the front. I took him in, in the softness of his hair, the hardness of his flesh. I moved up and down the length, and felt him slide in and out, almost perfectly without breaking the rhythm. I thought I could feel my own moisture on his pubic hair, which sent a shiver up my spine. I began moving faster on his cock, my pussy tightening around him so nicely.</p> <p>He took my hand that was still wrapped around him and held it against the counter. He slowly took my palm and brought it up to him, which he used as leverage. He continued to move his hips, moving his hand as I squeezed his. This was almost as if he wanted to bring me to my own climax, but he never let me come from his hand. I moved my hand to his chest, over his stomach, and began to move up the length of his body. When I reached the top, I stopped and said, "Honey, I want to feel you cum on me. I want it like that."</p> <p>In response, he kissed me and grabbed my hand that was still wrapped around him. I reached my other hand down to his butt, and started to rub him. He moaned into my mouth as his hips began to move again. Soon it became obvious I had nothing left to move. He was so hard his cock was pushing against my stomach. His hips started to thrust faster, and my hand couldn't keep pace with everything. I let go of his ass, and leaned over him. I put one hand on his and the other under his back, moving my hips in sync.</p> <p>He was still very hard from the blow job I had given him. He reached over with his free hand, and began to run his fingers through my hair. I moved from my position at him, on one side of the counter and I sat up higher on the edge. I moved forward to keep him away from my hips, but it wasn't long before my legs hit the counter too. I felt my lower half hit his chest as my body pressed forward.</p> <p>He took his hands and put them on my thighs, holding me with them as I moved forward on the counter. I wrapped my thighs around him as he reached his hands around and held my breasts. His fingers began to roam all over my body, from my shoulders, to my stomach. I had my head back against the wall, and he moved in front of me, my stomach pressing upward. My legs fell back to his chest, which he lifted and then lowered me to the counter.</p> <p>When he lowered me back to the counter, my body again pressed against him and his cock continued to enter my body. Our bodies moved with an almost perfect rhythm, his cock sliding into and out of my love canal over and over. He was the one in control, I realized. I reached my hands up to his face and pulled his mouth to mine. His lips parted, and his tongue forced its way into my mouth.</p> <p>I took his hand off my thigh and started to pull him forward. He lifted his hips, and I wrapped my legs around him and pulled him right into me again. He slid his hands behind my back and my ass dropped back against the counter. He began to thrust faster and harder, but I kept at him, pushing up with my hands to take him in deeper. When he reached for the cup, I put one finger under it, making him stop short of cumming. I quickly put both lips to his mouth, and held them there. One of his hands was on mine, and he pushed it down between us, down my side, to my ass.</p> <p>We rocked against each other, his cock still sliding into my love canal. I wanted to do it all day, but the feeling was so great in my pussy, I couldn't get enough of him inside me. He was starting to get a little heavy on me, and I felt him start to come up. He leaned toward me, but I quickly pulled him down, and kissed him as he lay on top of me.</p> <p>That started everything in to a blur. I felt as if I might cum from his lips on mine, from his kisses on my lips—but it was different. He began to lift his body up and down, grinding his hips together, and I felt a surge of love and contentment. He had always found it sexy to me, and I loved it, as long as I could have him inside me all day long.</p> <p>When I finished up on him, I reached down with both hands, and began to stroke him. It sent a wave of pleasure through him. I moved my hands away, keeping as close to him as I could, and began to work his cock.
