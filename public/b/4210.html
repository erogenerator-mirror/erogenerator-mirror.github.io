I've got a special surprise for you." He asked.</p> <p>"We've got time enough," I said. "Besides, I have the day off tomorrow."</p> <p>"Okay" he replied nervously.</p> <p>When I left the bedroom, he headed toward my bedroom to take a look at my lingerie. I took the lingerie I had bought to the bathroom. I didn't want to take any chances with him having a secret orgasm. I took the blue satin, the black lace, the garter and stockings. I had put my favorite vibrator up again which I found when I removed my skirt today. He smiled when I put on a robe and made his way to the bedroom.</p> <p>When he finally got to my bed, I had him lay on his side. I sat on the edge of the bed as I reached between his legs and started working the vibrator in and out of him.</p> <p>"Oh, that feels good." He murmured looking up at me with a grin.</p> <p>I was getting impatient so I turned the vibrator on a little more so I could play with his balls as I worked. I knew it wouldn't take too much to have him come in my hand. After about ten minutes, he stiffened and moaned loudly.</p> <p>I quickly removed the vibrator and started playing with it again.</p> <p>"Oh, Mommy" he whimpered.</p> <p>I moved his hand onto my knee and moved it up and down to my pussy. He massaged the whole area for about fifteen seconds before sliding his finger into me and starting a slow motion. I continued playing with him, teasing his balls while kissing him and caressing his cock. I started to stroke him again and he was starting to groan in anticipation of another orgasm.</p> <p>I worked him till he was almost ready to explode, then lifted his leg so that he was up and on his back. I straddled his body and started to stroke his cock again. When he started to buck under me, I slid his cock into my pussy and we both moaned.</p> <p>"Mommy likes to watch." he growled.</p> <p>"I love to watch." I replied, "I want to keep watching if you want me to come."</p> <p>"Oh, you have got it good." he replied.</p> <p>I leaned over him, keeping the vibrator buzzing in his wet pussy, and started to really suck on his cock while still stroking him. I took him up into the back of my mouth and started to slide him in and out of my mouth with long strokes of my tongue. I knew that he was getting close so I switched positions and slid my body back down on him.</p> <p>"This feels so good. Mommy is a good girl and I'm going to love making love to you!" he cried.</p> <p>"Go for it! You're going to make me come!" I replied.</p> <p>"Me too!" he replied.</p> <p>We fucked for another 20 minutes and I loved watching his face, knowing that he was close. I had him come over and over as I rubbed his balls, the underside of his cock, and I could tell he was getting close to coming again. I sensed his balls were tightening up, and I knew he was about to come. I slid upward on him as we both came together, then rolled off him and lay next to him.</p> <p>"That was marvelous!" I replied.</p> <p>"I've never come that much. But, you were incredible!" he replied.</p> <p>Once he had recovered, I moved to his side and we cuddled for a while then I asked him if he had enjoyed the evening's events.</p> <p>"After having sex for about an hour, I feel really dirty!" he replied.</p> <p>"I'm sorry to put that in such a vulgar way, but it was incredible."</p> <p>"It was also amazing, but it's okay to say stuff like that whenever we have an amazing evening. Are your parents still taking you to school?" He asked.</p> <p>"No. I'm afraid my mom did it last week."</p> <p>"Okay, she told me that your dad won't be back till Monday," he replied, "so I guess I'm going to put my plan into action and see what happens."</p> <p>"It's okay to say anything, especially when we've been spending time together, but I'm not surprised that he says something like that."</p> <p>"Well, in that case, it won't bother you if we're alone, at least not for a little while. But I want you to be very careful if your father and I are going to use the opportunity as a big opportunity for us to get to know each other better, not just as just our friends."</p> <p>"I'm sure you won't be able to explainâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
