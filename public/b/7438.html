She stood still like a statue, taking his hands in hers and kissing him tenderly and deeply on the lips. When the two melted into each other, the two became a thing, one wanting more and more of the one being, but needing much more of the other.</p> <p>"I hope that is enough for you," she smiled softly.</p> <p>"Absolutely, love!"</p> <p>She grinned and kissed her again, once more and whispered, "We'll see."</p> <p>Chapter 6</p> <p>She returned after a quick shower, and told her new master that she would find out more about him the moment he went to bed.</p> <p>"He had a great deal to do!" she told herself, "I'll be right there!"</p> <p>They had dinner together in a dark and intimate but romantic restaurant, in her new bedroom on top of her new home that afternoon. The two were naked in their own bed, holding each other, kissing, stroking each others' bodies. For the first time in their lives, all was as new and wonderful as it could be, but it wasn't long before she reached a crescendo that she had never known before.</p> <p>"Oh, David, oh, David..." she whispered in his ear when the climax struck her, "I think I can't get it out of my mind!" she giggled, and he laughed, too.</p> <p>They went back to their shared house, and when David was hard again with her, she sucked him off before taking him inside her back there.</p> <p>Chapter 7</p> <p>They had a wonderful time, talking about what had happened to them in the kitchen, and trying to get each other to say more about "the one"... how things turned out, and who they had come to love. The following week was a blur, for they both tried to talk to each other about nothing, about anything and everyone else they were with, but never seemed to find the words.</p> <p>It was Saturday evening, and her master returned home from work, and they were lying in bed that evening. David was still naked and half-erect, as they talked when she said, "I thought you would never come home this time."</p> <p>"I am sorry," he said, "it was the first time in my life that I was completely alone. I never had anyone's permission."</p> <p>She giggled and said, "He has permission already, love!"</p> <p>"Then we can celebrate!"</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"You are not alone, you are the one!" she said, smiling happily.</p> <p>"David, I'm still mad, but if you are serious I'll do anything you want, just don't do anything you wouldn't do! I don't know if I can even begin to thank you for everything you've done in the past."</p> <p>"Hm?"</p> <p>"I really did, David. You've done nothing but make me happy. I still don't understand it, but at least you didn't suffer from the pain of loss, or the heartache of losing your marriage. I would have been devastated, but I didn't have your permission."</p> <p>"No, I can't, Love."</p> <p>"I think we should talk about that, but I don't know if I can handle that conversation!"</p> <p>David looked her in the face and said, "Don't you want a divorce?"</p> <p>"I do love you, David, and I'm so excited for what you think you may have in mind."</p> <p>"I can't wait. I want to make love to you too, darling!"</p> <p>"You have to kiss me," she said.</p> <p>"Then you have to give me the kiss of my life!"</p> <p>"If it's as good as that kiss you gave me all those years ago, then I will do it again!"</p> <p>"Ohh!"</p> <p>"I need to do it to you, David! We have to do this, or we never will. It's been years since we've done it, and I want to give you this kiss of our life!"</p> <p>"If I take it too fast, it will scare you off."</p> <p>"Don't be silly! After all, I love you! We're both alone here now and we can do anything we want!"</p> <p>His heart was a fluttering hammer, and his cock was hard as he kissed her.</p> <p>"I want you again," he whispered, "Please, Darling, please give me the kiss of my life!"</p> <p>They did it, softly, over and over, and David kissed her until she was trembling with need. When there were no more kisses to give, he picked her up and carried her to their bed. He lay on the bed and lay beside her, and caressed her body, kissing her and stroking her until she was moaningâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
