This was a very strange request but in the end we agreed. He would pick us up at 8.</p> <p>It was not until he had put the food down that we started to feel any sense of disappointment. The wait staff was working overtime and it had gotten to the point that he would need to take our bags into the hotel hotel bar and get a drink or two before we got there. This time the waiter came right out to tell us there might be something that might happen and it took us a moment to decide.</p> <p>At 6 o'clock we were sitting in a booth when he got up and said, "Have you done anything with a woman?"</p> <p>We both sat quiet looking at each other. "No, not really." I was afraid to say something so I just looked at him with the biggest, most confused look I could muster.</p> <p>We ordered drinks in his hotel bar and got him to stand next to us with one in each hand. This of course was in the middle of the next room.</p> <p>I don't think either of us knew how comfortable we were feeling. He was looking intently at us and I could tell he was uncomfortable.</p> <p>After a few moments he said "You seem nervous about it. If I were you I'd be uncomfortable doing this. We're doing this because we like each other and want to be with each other." He turned to face us and added, "We are attracted to each other."</p> <p>I couldn't believe how nervous he was. After the first couple of drinks (it took ten of us to get through that) he didn't seem all that nervous. He was smiling, but he still wasn't looking at our eyes.</p> <p>After he was done drinking we left our booth and walked back to our table.</p> <p>He kept a big smile on his face telling me how nervous he had been.</p> <p>He told me he had just had a great trip and wanted to spend as much time as possible with me. That's when we made eye contact as we walked toward the door of our table. He had his eyes glued to my eyes as I walked toward him and he could not help but look back at me. His expression was very intense for us.</p> <p>We got to the table and I leaned over taking his face between my hands but not close enough to have any contact between us.</p> <p>"This can't happen right now. We have to be careful. Right now I don't want that smile or look and feel uncomfortable talking to our waitress about it. I don't want you to think that I'm some kind of pervert, I'd just like to keep it all to myself."</p> <p>We just sat there for several minutes. I thought he would stay there forever, but he finally broke and just looked at me like he was going to say something but then started looking back at me again. For the second time in as many minutes I just stayed there not looking back at him.</p> <p>"Do you...want to, uh.... go back to your room? Maybe in the tub or something."</p> <p>I didn't say anything. I could feel myself start to flush very badly and I couldn't bring myself to look his way. It was then that I realized for the first time that I was about to say "yes" and it was the only option I had.</p> <p>"I'm not asking for anything from you I just want you to stay right here with me for a while. Please?"</p> <p>"Ok."</p> <p>He left to use my bathroom but I sat there for what seemed like forever thinking about how much I liked this guy. My stomach was really queasy. I could not believe how nervous I almost felt.</p> <p>About an hour or so later he came out of the bathroom wearing a bathrobe. I could see that he was not taking anything off. He pulled a bottle of scented sun block from his pocket and handed me the bottle. He sat down next to me with a glass of water for his and I also had my glass of water.</p> <p>"This water is perfect. That should help after the tub. Have a good soak. It feels great and I wish you could feel better yourself."</p> <p>"Thank you." I sat there looking around at how empty the bar and bar area was.</p> <p>"I'm sorry for interrupting. Here, have your glass of water." I went with him to the bar. The bathrobe was completely open and it draped across his lap and I had a full view of his penis. It was a great view and I thought I could see my own nipples hardening. I felt flushed and wet all overâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
