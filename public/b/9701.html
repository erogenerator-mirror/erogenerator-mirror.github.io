I feel like I'm always ready, even when I go wild."</p> <p>"I do too. If it helps, we still have quite a lot I can do with my imagination."</p> <p>"Me too. If we do this right, you should get to see my face after you cum."</p> <p>"That's okay. You can play too, if you wanted to. You can use your fingers too at times."</p> <p>Sonia looked stunned, but her eyes got very wide in amazement.</p> <p>"We've gotta do this right, I know. We should definitely do this!"</p> <p>After she had taken his cock into her mouth and let him slide out, she looked him in the eye. She kissed him on the cheek, then, kissing her way down his chest, she started to lick his balls.</p> <p>"Let me suck them?"</p> <p>He smiled and slowly sat up on the bed, positioning herself on her knees. She grabbed his cock through his boxers. She licked the tip, then pulled him in. All the way till the back of her throat, then all the way again. He was so hard, she could hardly take it. She pulled out, kissed the tip and looked up at him.</p> <p>"Ready?"</p> <p>"Fuck yeah."</p> <p>She kissed the tip.</p> <p>"No. Come on. It's okay, you can tell me. I'm a novice."</p> <p>She grabbed his cock again as she went back down. He felt so good in her mouth. The softness, the warmth. He'd never felt anything so good in his entire married life. He looked down, saw how good it felt, and wanted to see more.</p> <p>"Ok, I can see it."</p> <p>"No. I'm not having sex with you. You're my second time. We're just doing it."</p> <p>He held her head while she bobbed her head on his cock. He could feel her soft lips slide along every inch of his shaft each time. It felt so good. She held one fist around the base of his cock, so her thumb pressed hard as she sucked hard, as her tongue flicked back the top. He felt the wetness of her mouth as she bobbed her head and held his breath. She pulled her head off and kissed his cock again. Her hand gently stroked his cock, which had grown harder and bigger. She leaned in and kissed the tip, then slid her lips on down to his ball sac, kissing there and then kissing his balls. He could feel her breath on his cock as she kissed them.</p> <p>His hands were on her head, which felt so good. She took his cock out of her mouth with a wet pop, and moved back up.</p> <p>"There you go," she said. "I guess. I guess we're on for tonight."</p> <p>I've never had anything like this in my mouth. Amazingly, she continued sucking.</p> <p>"How does it taste?" she asked.</p> <p>She sucked his cock again, and he could feel his cock growing harder in her mouth. Suddenly, he felt himself stiffen, and she felt the warm cum surge into her mouth. She swallowed with a happy groan as it left her mouth. She kissed the tip of his cock.</p> <p>"You're delicious. I have absolutely no idea how you get this cock up your throat."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>He kissed her and kissed his way back down as she sucked. Her mouth felt like warm silk. He felt the heady mix of saliva and his cum on the way down. She stopped sucking his cock as his head hit the back of her throat.</p> <p>He reached down and gently took her head in his hands, then turned her around. She leaned forward and kissed him while holding her breath. After a minute, she moved her mouth away for an instant, allowing him to push her onto the bed.</p> <p>Her naked breast hung in front of him. He didn't give her time to get out of bed. He pushed her down over the side, onto her belly. She was beautiful. Her skin was cool, and when she sat up, he could see some of his cum on her skin and her pubic hair as it was pulled back by her position. His cock throbbed, throbbed. He wanted that pussy, and that pussy was about to be his for the rest of the weekend. He pulled her legs over his shoulders as she let him have her. He put her legs back together and she put her feet on his shoulders as he started to push his cock head in.</p> <p>Her pussy opened up easily while his cock slid further into herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
