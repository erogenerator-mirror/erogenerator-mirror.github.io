So I agreed.</p> <p>We all decided on going through with it and agreed to meet in bed after all we've already done, but it seemed like fun because we'd both been a little anxious to take the initiative. It didn't make sense. But we agreed that we might as well join in after all.</p> <p>And so we did. We took our clothes off and lay face to face, kissing, fondling each other. I kissed her neck and then licked her nipples, which were already hard. She loved that. I licked her clit and fingered her as she rubbed my dick to a nice hard pace. She was really ready. I licked her slit and found that she was still a little pinker than before. She moaned. So I moved to her clit and then rubbed it, a little rough-ish, then fingered it a little. It was a little sensitive.</p> <p>Then I started sucking her nipples, which I knew would drive her crazy. She was so sexy and excited.</p> <p>"Oh!" she cried out, as I slipped two fingers into her, and pumped them in and out.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," she exclaimed at the same time. I felt her pussy clamp down on my fingers as she came. The sound was so incredibly sexy.</p> <p>I sucked her clit some more and fingered her clit some more as she came, harder and harder the harder she came. Now she wasn't just trembling but her hips were really high off the mattress.</p> <p>When she finally went limp, I moved up her body and we embraced, kissing again. I kissed her breasts and nipples. Then I licked her mouth. It went a lot better than she would have preferred. I was on top of her now, moving my dick up and down, making little movements with each slide. I felt like an animal, like no one in this place had ever got me off.</p> <p>"I'm ready," She suddenly said.</p> <p>"Ready?" I said.</p> <p>"Yes, I've been ready for such a long time. I want you. I want you inside me. Please." She sounded scared, but she was smiling again. "I want it. Please, just do it."</p> <p>I was amazed. She was begging and pleading for it and I was getting excited, too.</p> <p>I had no problem making her wait, slowly going in and going back out. On and on, in, out.</p> <p>"Are you OK?" I asked once I was all the way in.</p> <p>"Yes, yes! I'm...it's so..." she was saying.</p> <p>"Good? Are you fine?"</p> <p>"Yes, very good," she replied, which I could hear as she kept breathing hard and trying hard to control her movements. I leaned over and kissed her. She was still trying hard to talk but she kept saying, "Yes, let's go, let's go, let's go, baby...fuck me now...don't make me wait."</p> <p>So I started fucking her steadily, while kissing her. I couldn't hold myself back and shot everything I had into her in a really big, long time. And a big moment. I was not just the biggest cummer she'd ever had, but my first big, and I know, bigger than any other guy she had ever had. She came as well. She was trembling, trying to hold on to me. Her body seemed to move inside me and I was surprised that she was getting off in the end and not squealing so much as moaning.</p> <p>"It's OK, it's OK!" she said.</p> <p>"It's only OK," I said, still kissing her, but gently. She looked at me, smiled, and then her face looked all pearly white, but I felt myself starting to swell. So I made her keep me in her longer. There was no way I could lose it.</p> <p>After a while, we cuddled each other and let her recover. We lay on there for a while with her legs curled under me and her arms around me, while I kissed her lovely, sweet lips and said: "Do you think your friend is going to be upset?"</p> <p>"No, not really."</p> <p>But I sensed it was something that we needed to talk about anyway. So I said. "It's OK. You were great. I'm really pleased you had the guts to make it happen. I think I'm going to be in your future. I know you're going to want me. I think I'd like to try and be an example to someone else when they get married and live with a dad who won't let them live atâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
