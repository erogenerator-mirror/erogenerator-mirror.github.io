"I'm an ass," she muttered in the back of her throat, a nervous giggle escaping her every time she said it. "I'm not a virgin, I swear." She bit her lower lip to stifle her own laughter, but was quick to correct her. "But I've never had a guy before, and I guess the chances are slim." She closed her eyes again, allowing that last phrase to drift away before she spoke again, her voice low and husky. "Would you go over there for a while? I could feel your eyes staring at me through my hair." She heard herself gasp as he turned back to her, the corner of her lips quirking. "I know what you need," he whispered. "I could spend the whole night wondering what you're really like, what your body feels like." His hand rested against her back, tracing small circles over it even as he spoke those words, moving ever so slightly so that she couldn't quite take it. "I need to be that way for as long as you want me to be. It gets lonely here, and there just isn't enough privacy for that." His touch was soft and sweet, and she could do no more than hold onto it. He slid his hand down her arm, brushing against her skin as he slid down, his hands coming to rest on either side of her neck.</p> <p>"That sounds like you've been waiting for this," She bit her lip. "Tell me what you were looking at when you took off those glasses."</p> <p>"They're not glasses," he said simply. "They're my glasses." She shuddered inwardly, her blush deepening as she heard his reply. "The first time... well... I swear I couldn't keep my eyes off them. And I swear it was even more intense than before." He chuckled against her ear, a soft and husky sound that made her tremble. "The second time... well, I swear I still couldn't stop staring at them." She nodded, not looking away as he trailed his fingertips over her skin softly before sliding down again. "But then you showed up..." His eyes met hers once more, and this time as he pressed forward so that she couldn't help herself and slid along the bed as her mind worked to fill in the blanks in her fantasies. "You took off those glasses so effortlessly, so perfectly," he whispered, his lips leaving hers to trail a trail of feather-light kisses along her neck. "Your eyes, those eyes..." His fingers tightened on her shoulders, sliding them down her shoulders, across her body, down her ribs as he knelt between her legs, kissing her lips again. "I couldn't stop looking at them, couldn't stop touching..." She whimpered when he paused between her legs as his hand slid against her, caressing her body slowly, teasing and tantalizing her. "And... now, it's your turn for touching," His kiss moved slowly off her lips, causing her eyes to close and her body relax. "Let go of me," he whispered, his fingers curling into her hair as he kissed her once more, his lips brushing against her neck again. "That's it." His hand slid lower, sliding down to cup her center in his palm, his fingers pressing into her, pushing inwards so that his palm brushed over her. She whimpered against his lips, biting in between his teeth. "Tell me." A finger pressed into her aching center, forcing her to whimper in anticipation. His mouth moved, his tongue slowly kissing across her skin, licking, tasting as his hand pressed into her harder and firmer the higher he pressed, the more she whimpered into his kiss.</p> <p>"More," he said hoarsely against her neck. His fingers twisted inside of her as his lips pressed hard against hers, claiming her mouth, forcing it open, taking her tongue into his mouth. "I need you inside of me," he whispered against her ear. Her fingers tangled into his hair as she struggled for air, pushing against his fingertips as he slipped a thumb inside and pressed deep; her thighs trembled against his legs as the waves of lust flowed over her. "Make me come," he breathed against her neck, his lips pressing against the hollow of her ear as his thumb pressed inside her, rubbing her clit as his thumb pressed against her.</p> <p>She gasped as he slid two fingers inside of her, pulling them out, stroking her wet pussy while they did so. "God," she moaned. "That feels so wrong." She closed her eyes tight, struggling to breathe as he rubbed her just as roughly as she had done. "But you're making everything alright. You're making me feel like a dirty little whore... you're making me feel as though I've never been touched before..."
