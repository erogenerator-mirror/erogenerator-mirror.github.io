It's time."</p> <p>Gabby got between my legs and rubbed her pussy on my aching dick, sliding it down just enough to let some prejuice seeped out her labia. As she rubbed my dick down she could feel her own juice being coated my head. She started to rub herself, squeezing my dick with her pussy muscles as I pushed up.</p> <p>"OH GOD! YOU'RE SO BIG! YES! I don't believe this! I can't believe how big! Oh shit!!!! It feels so good!!! It's so much!!! I love this big cock! I love watching you, rubbing and fucking my pussy..."</p> <p>"Mmm. I know. I'm sure I can take more than a couple of inches now."</p> <p>She slid down further on my shaft so she could suck my balls with her sweet mouth and feel the tip of my dick touch her cervix.</p> <p>"Oh god, it's so much!!"</p> <p>We were both moaning again, both completely spent. But at the same time we were completely exhausted from riding like animals and just laying here in each other's arms.</p> <p>Gabby climbed off of my tool and went round to the side of me and leaned across and gave me a deep kiss.</p> <p>"Thank you so much for making love with me tonight. It was good for me too, but my head was still a bit fuzzy and I didn't feel so sexy anymore."</p> <p>"It was good too. Even better than yesterday."</p> <p>Gabby looked at me lovingly "And I'll do it again next weekend too. You're the best lover. We still love each other."</p> <p>"Mmm, I'd like that too. I still have feelings for you though, but I've got to start working on our relationshipâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
