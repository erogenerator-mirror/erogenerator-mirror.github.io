Every time he would put his hand under my t-shirt, I was always naked. He always felt me up with one of his hands. After all his teasing, I was surprised how soft my skin felt. It took my breath away. My nipples got even harder and he would suck on them a little too hard.</p> <p>I have no idea what happened with him but I have to tell you, it was always a bit of a turn on to know that every now and then he would go to my bed. I felt the most special kind of freedom that I have ever felt in my life when I walked in with a towel wrapped around me. I never had to do any more than put some clothes on, when I walked in, with the towel so tight around me that I wasn't able to completely stand up. I couldn't tell you if I felt the same way or not, but I thought I felt it all the time.</p> <p>I was always the one at the kitchen table. He was always talking to me, and then he would turn me on his lap for a minute or two. He would take another cup of coffee, get up and come back to the coffee bar while I was still trying to finish my first cup. Just like that, my mind was focused on his hands all over me and how they slid over my shoulders and then down my arms, pulling the straps of my bra slowly off. All I could think of was how wonderful that feels.</p> <p>Then, something unexpected happened. I never thought a stranger could make me feel that way. I didn't even think about how he touched me. He moved his hands all over me and I found out later that it was just the way he touched me. The feeling and feeling of his fingers in my arms, down my arm, over my breast was making me feel very special. I have no idea what turned me on about it, and I don't know if it was the way he told me to get a drink or his touch, but whenever he would be touching me that way in public, it made me feel so... special.</p> <p>I could feel it in the way he would look at me when he brought me to my table, at his table, all night long. I think I just like to be looked at. I just looked away while we talked over our tea, or when it was really late at night, when our parents couldn't come back. Every time he would talk to me he would look at me and it was as if I was the only girl in school that he knew and he knew that I was special, that's how it always felt to me. He would look at me, and then smile at me as he placed the cup back down.</p> <p>Even he could tell a little bit of a difference. I know I was staring at his eyes, but I did feel his eyes in my face. There I was, staring down at a cup of my favorite mug and wondering what his eyes were looking at. I think that it gave me the most powerful feeling at the time. All I could think of was I loved it and he loved it, too. I knew he could read it in my expression, just like my own. The way my eyes were closed and everything seemed to be focused on the person under his breath. I think that I felt something that I guess was a bit strange about it. Something that he saw as a bit of a turn on.</p> <p>It didn't help that he still had his hand on my shoulder. It just let me know that he was still talking to me. He would take another sip from his cup, and then I felt his hand slide up my neck, over my collarbone. He didn't make any movements over my neck as much as he did up my top button, but he just seemed to take a little more of his weight on his hand on my neck. He felt my neck against his arm and as he looked up at me, I smiled. It was one of the most erotic feelings I've ever had. I could feel his hand slowly moving up my body that was pressed against my bra. I knew he was feeling me up, but he didn't make any moves. I can only lay there and smile and wonder what our parents would think. He was looking me in the eyes and I could feel the electricity running from his gaze to my arms.</p> <p>As I laid there, he let his hand slid over my bare skin for a time. I was wearing a black bra that was a little too tight around my small but perky breasts. My nipples were still firm, sticking up a bit, and I could feel the moisture on them as he slid his body under mine. I could feel his hard cock against my legâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
