And when you get here, you can decide when you get to cum. That ought to do it."</p> <p>"I guess I'm going to need some relief." said I.</p> <p>"Well, I know what you need now," said I.</p> <p>She rolled me over on top of her body and I went on top of her. It looked like a wild thing that's me doing that. She held me against her breast and when I was inside her, like I had in the limelight at the airport, I felt every bit of pressure inside her as I felt her insides tighten. "Oh, gee, don't be too long!" she said.</p> <p>"Are we going to have to make love on your sofa?" said I.</p> <p>"Oh, but we will! Now!"</p> <p>With that we had to lie there in each other's arms for some time. I didn't give it another thought that I would miss this first-time experience. That's why I said it was OK to think of it. But what about if I was to fuck her in any way as well? Should I ask her to let me fuck her! I said to myself, "Sure, I mean. Why not? You won't have to explain at all what we did and if you do, fine!"</p> <p>When we were sure that we had gotten it all under our control, I said, "I am going to put my lips on yours. You will not believe it!"</p> <p>I stuck my tongue into her mouth and felt the warmth of her tongue. She accepted it and after some thought, said, "Well, there again!"</p> <p>"I just hope I can perform as nice as you think I can," I said. "I must be going to have to be a bit of an exhibitionist."</p> <p>She said, "Oh, no you don't. Not you! I love it that you like showing yourself to other men when you wear that. I really would love to see if you are as nice as you think you are. I mean, just be sure about making yourself cum. That's the main thing, isn't it?"</p> <p>"OK. You are just looking for it and I'm just making sure, are you?" I said.</p> <p>"Well," she said, "I'm sure!"</p> <p>I pulled her into a kiss with a whole lot more force but she didn't seem to like it. She kissed me back for a while, then said, "Hey, when we finish, you can put that thing that I just made love to into a condom! I am sure I can be an extra condom tonight!"</p> <p>I got a condom that said "Glamour" in large letters. It didn't come with a wrapper and it looked so fancy that it didn't even need to be put in. I said thanks and took the bag. I got back up on top of her and started to kiss her again and she responded by pushing me back and reaching for my cock. I reached behind her holding myself between us.</p> <p>"You don't have to put a condom, if you want to fuck me; just use my finger to push a tiny bit so you can slide the tip of your finger inside, OK?" I asked.</p> <p>"What! You want me to do anything with this thing!" she said with excitement in her voice.</p> <p>"I am going to slip in the tip of that thing, then you could just put it in. It's pretty fancy but you'll love it. If you want to, just let me know. You don't need to worry. It's a good thing you can feel it. Otherwise the penis might get uncomfortable."</p> <p>"Oh, no, I want to feel it in me. Not in a hole." She stopped me. "You have to try and get all the way in, too. Now just lay down and I will rub it in you. We don't do anything like intercourse, do we?"</p> <p>"Oh, no, no one should get hurt before. I'll just let it come on then."</p> <p>She took the KY tube from my hands and coated the head of my penis with it. I had no idea she had this stuff! It gave me a hard-on I didn't want to lose and it was nice after watching her do that.</p> <p>"How should I make it feel?" I asked.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah. I know you better than to say no. That would ruin the mood. Come on, it's not the size. When you get ready, feel the pressure, push gently in and pull in out."</p> <p>"OK! That's nice," I said. "I can just lie here and let you do what you want."</p> <p>"Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
