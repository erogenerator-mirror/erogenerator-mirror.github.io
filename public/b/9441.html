Good choice bro."</p> <p>"You got it, man!" said the boy.</p> <p>"I'll try anything once"</p> <p>"You can do anything as long as I help!" the boy said.</p> <p>"It's nice to know the guy likes girls."</p> <p>"You need to learn not to get excited. Boys are really weird," said the boy, before walking over to the bar. "See you if you wanna join us later?"</p> <p>"We'll have to get along better!" said the boy, walking away.</p> <p>"Can you have the boys drink their tequila?" asked the boy?</p> <p>"We'll have to make sure they are ready to dance," he said</p> <p>"They sure are. Thanks." The boy smiled.</p> <p>"I'll be right back," the girl said as she walked up to her room.</p> <p>~</p> <p>When the boys all returned, the blonde said, "Damn you look good," then turned towards her and gave her a kiss.</p> <p>"Thanks."</p> <p>The three boys smiled.</p> <p>The girl said, "I really do have to go, I don't have anyone staying with me tonight so I have to go. I really didn't intend on doing anything with a man tonight, so thank you."</p> <p>They each drank a glass of tequila and walked off to get dressed while still laughing at their own jokes. "If I didn't need one to go, I'd take off my clothes and fuck you right there right now!"</p> <p>The boys laughed and started to get dressed, only to each of them stop. They quickly got dressed and turned to look at the girl. "You're the hot one tonight. You should be out in front of the whole bar tonight!"</p> <p>The blonde smiled and said, "Thanks a bunch!"</p> <p>The two boys shook their hands and walked out the door, laughing as they did so. The blonde was feeling extremely embarrassed, even as she looked back at the boy who'd just said that just a few moments ago. She looked back at the boy. "How do you feel? I mean is this even a date, is my boyfriend not a guy?"</p> <p>"You're probably right."</p> <p>The blonde laughed and said, "Come on, let's hit the beach before I can go back in there, OK. I have to get changed. I hate the cold. My clothes are soaking wet."</p> <p>The boy got up and followed her out to the back of the bar. "Wow, you look great tonight. I've never seen you dressed as good."</p> <p>"Thanks, you're a special guy. You can definitely turn a lot of heads!"</p> <p>The boy grinned, but didn't say anything.</p> <p>The blonde shook her head and walked into a large and comfortable bedroom. She walked over to the closet and grabbed a couple of other clothes. She picked another pair for her boyfriend to try on but put them on. She walked over and saw a short denim skirt that she really liked, so she put it on and pulled it on. The boys whistled. "She really has the cutest little pussy!"</p> <p>The blonde giggled and shook her head, her breasts nearly exploding out of her shirt. "I know, but you haven't seen it yet!" She grabbed her clothes one and started pulling on her boots.</p> <p>"You look terrific!" said the boy as he grabbed a pair of her panties. "Here, put these on. They really accent my ass."</p> <p>She smiled and put them on before walking back to her room. "Why don't I just walk back in there and get changed in there?"</p> <p>The boy, still grinning, said, "I've been there and done that once before."</p> <p>The blonde stopped at the door and turned around. "Haha, I knew you had a tight body. I bet your boyfriend isn't even watching you get changed?"</p> <p>The boy didn't answer his girlfriend's question and instead walked over to her. "Well, you are still the hottest thing I've ever saw, so I guess I won't mind getting the boys attention tonight." He said with a big smile.</p> <p>She laughed and sat down on her own bed, as the boy stood there smiling. "What happened to you on the boat?"</p> <p>The boy chuckled and answered, "We got back home and it was like my whole body went into convulsions."</p> <p>The boy smiled and replied, "Yeah, I do. You still look good."</p> <p>She sighed and replied, "Yeah, you probably don't need to tell me that."</p> <p>The boy grinned at her as he pulled his own shirt on. "Thanks." Then he walked out of the room and disappeared into the bedroomâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
