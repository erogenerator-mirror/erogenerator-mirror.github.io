I asked.</p> <p>"Honey..."</p> <p>And he kissed her again, then asked her how much she wanted to do the same.</p> <p>"Just do it, honey," she said. "I'm a big strong girl. We can do it."</p> <p>He kissed her again, but this time more aggressively.</p> <p>Sally's arms were around his neck, and she had her legs around his waist. Her heels were pressing up against his ass and crotch. He was pushing slowly into her, but very deeply.</p> <p>He was in her mouth and his hips were moving just a little.</p> <p>"Just do it, honey," she whispered. "Just do it."</p> <p>He kept moving in and out of her. I'm sure he was going to cum soon, but he stopped.</p> <p>He looked at me seriously for a moment, his smile just slightly widening. "It's ok," he said. "It's ok."</p> <p>He lifted her head from between his hands and looked me back in the eye. It was a look he used all the time.</p> <p>I felt a tiny bit more awkward doing something that I had to be honest with my wife. Not only did her know that this was what I wanted her to do, but she was okay with it. She had come to him to be gentle and to please him in ways which his wife rarely did. As a part-time sales consultant, he had been giving her this gift.</p> <p>He pulled her back to him and she looked up at him.</p> <p>"Ok," she said. "Go ahead."</p> <p>She knew he was going to do it. He was going to do it.</p> <p>He lifted her by the hips so she was just lying down, and she put her arms around his neck. She was still smiling.</p> <p>"Just move with me," he said. "If you want a little more..."</p> <p>When he did this, he moved all the way and pulled out until just the head of his penis was inside her pussy. It slid right in.</p> <p>"Oh, my," I said.</p> <p>It was just a very slow, nice, slow fuck. I thought it was over by the time he was done, but it wasn't - he was just going in and out a little bit. I still wasn't exactly sure how to feel about it. Part of me, perhaps, was a bit hurt that he didn't let her do it any more, but I felt a bit ashamed that my wife wouldn't go along with it.</p> <p>I turned to look at Sally. This man was fucking her, and she was enjoying it. I saw her eyes roll back.</p> <p>"Oh, fuck," I whispered. I just wanted to get closer.</p> <p>Then I looked at his eyes, as he pushed deeper inside her. I felt it. It was not just like when he would do it, no, like he knew she wouldn't stop.</p> <p>"Oh, shit," I said again. I tried to watch the expression on his face. It was an expression, though, which was totally different from when he looked at me. It was sad. It was almost as if it had been a long time for me, but for him to be looking at his face and seeing my wife's eyes roll into the back of her head, and having that look back on her was a huge turn-on. But then he closed his eyes and was looking at her face as she continued to hold him.</p> <p>"Oh, Jesus," I whispered. I felt like I was going to have to cry. I held her, and she had no idea who felt the need that it might be too. But it was still very nice.</p> <p>It was a very nice long, slow fuck, and we came about the same time he pulled out. He was looking into her eyes, and as he did so, he kissed her as she looked at him. When he left her, she hugged him.</p> <p>I didn't know why I had felt that way about her. But I had, and I really did think the love we had for each other was only for me.</p> <p>He didn't say much more. It was just a quick hug. I went back to my wife.</p> <p>"It doesn't bother you if I cum in you," he said into my ears. "What's wrong?"</p> <p>I put my fingers into his mouth.</p> <p>"I'm not going to tell you I'm cumming anytime soon," I said softly. It wasn't the first time that I had heard a man say that.</p> <p>She was still holding him.</p> <p>"Sally," I said. "Do you really want to do that?"</p> <p>She smiled.</p> <p>"No," she said. "But we both love it."</p> <p>He pushed backâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
