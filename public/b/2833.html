I didn't need any details of what we planed to do; I knew how much she liked our sex. I told her I could only fuck her on our first date, and that I really liked it. I was sure of it I guess, she was very receptive. She really enjoyed it, and I just needed to know.</p> <p>When we got to our home we were both dripping, and the first act was a bit of a turn. Before we got it started I got on the bed and lay back, my feet on the floor. She moved up between my legs and sat down on me. I took her breasts in my hands and gently massaged them for a while. Just before the tips of her nipples grazed me she looked into my eyes with an amazing smile. I could see the fire in her eyes, my cock was so hard, she moved up and took me in her mouth.</p> <p>At the same time she had me playing with her cunt, I was looking down at her face, looking into her eyes, looking into the fire in there. I was thinking I wanted to fuck her and had to decide on an early day as she had asked. As soon as she took me out of her mouth I knew I had to go into the bathroom. My cock was about ready to fuck her. I got to the bathroom and just sat on the toilet, looking into the mirror. She was staring at me in a daze. Her mouth hung slack and her tits looked so sexy, a smile on her lips. I was just trying to keep my composure. Finally she walked over to me and bent her head and started to kiss and lick and suck my balls, making me start to breathe. She was really good at it, and I know if I could have just asked her to stay, she would have. Her nipples were so hard, and I could see her pussy lips were still wet and open, which must be one of her favorite ways for her to be hot.</p> <p>She got up, turned away from me and slowly unzipped her dress letting her ass sway in front of me. She just smiled and went to get a robe. When she came back she opened and gave me that sexy "I'm hungry" look, and then she slid the robe off her shoulders, and let it drop onto the floor. She walked back to her chair as I slid my slacks down and started to walk toward her. She stopped and sat down again, this time her hand reached out and started to start stroking my cock.</p> <p>I'm really not sure how much I said it. I was just too horny. But of course I didn't.</p> <p>"Will you let me suck your cock baby, please?" She had a look of urgency on her face with no hint of what she wanted me to do.</p> <p>Before I got to the part where she begged me to fuck her, I had to convince her to fuck me. It was a good thing I brought a condom, because she was wet when I got near. She just kept smiling as I got on the bed, she had just started to lick my cock, slowly licking the very tip. Then she looked up and saw the love bite on my cock. I just looked down at her, and nodded. She reached to caress my cock, and that was the end of the first "fuck" of the night. She just leaned forward and took it in again. After about a minute she just stopped, and pulled off of my cock.</p> <p>She looked at me, she said "I want you in me baby, please."</p> <p>I'm not sure if she was begging me to stay, she asked.</p> <p>"Sure, I'll stay, but you gotta promise to keep your word, I don't want to cheat on you."</p> <p>I said, "Okay babe, sure I promise."</p> <p>It was a wonderful night, there was one thing that made it special. There was absolutely no chance of cheating on my wife.</p> <p>So, the following week we made love, and talked about how much we liked it, and about what came next. We talked about what we'd done and what we'd done. She was so loving and giving and it was so nice to be so close to someone who loved and enjoyed sex.</p> <p>After we started dating my wife kept telling me how much she loved me, because it was very important that I understand how I made her feel. I guess that was just a little more than I had anticipated. But there was nothing I could say to her, because I was so confused. She even asked me if she could fuck me, I'm pretty sure she tried to hold back because of the fear of getting pregnant.</p> <p>That night we just lay together for a while, then I told her to get off the bedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
