That is of course a bonus. But don't say you've not enjoyed them. They are just a bonus, not an obligation. They are always open."</p> <p>She laughed. "I could ask for more. You are always so thoughtful."</p> <p>"Very thoughtful. How thoughtful." As soon as he finished a third of what was left in the box, he held the phone in his hand and looked back towards the bed. "Do you have plans for tomorrow?"</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Good. So, I'm off. I'm heading out now. Have you had time to come down? I've been away so long, we can have some time together tomorrow."</p> <p>"Okay, but let's wait until I get ready."</p> <p>He sighed and put the phone down. He was already in the shower when she got out of the bathroom. He watched her through the glass and he felt the tension he had been carrying for so long melting away in the face of his presence as she washed herself and shampooed her hair. He washed himself and took himself out of his wet clothes before climbing under the water. It felt good to wash away the saltiness of the early mornings but he didn't mind in the least. They were the perfect time to talk about anything at all; they had talked about all the little things that they'd been up to, and all the big and important things that they'd been trying to do for each other. He felt he had learned a lot today, not just about one person, but also about the world that he'd grown up in.</p> <p>There was just something about her that felt right and right at the same time. He wasn't sure that he could call her the 'Korath' name for her, but he would try anything once and just hold the phone to her. At the top of his list was her hair. She'd already been washed and conditioned in the manner that they had on the days they had been apart. What mattered now was what things she planned to wear and how she would look in them. She'd always hated the way it was when she sat. The way that it was all they needed to wear for today was just a couple of inches above the knees.</p> <p>He heard a knock on his door and his heart gave a little skip. He put the phone down and picked up the package he'd slipped into the box and opened the box. There inside, he found a dozen or so things that would change his life tomorrow and tonight, his life. They were all about him with his happiness, his happiness in finding a beautiful woman and the happiness of knowing she could bring him everything that he'd always thought he'd want. Even though he had just gotten married to her, he was already thinking about things that had been bugging him for months and years. He'd always thought there was no way with his happiness getting in the way of what she already had going on.</p> <p>He took the final wrapping paper from her and held it out again, giving her another kiss as she closed the box. "Ready," he said, his voice rumbling.</p> <p>"Just a minute," she whispered, turning and stepping out of the shower.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>Korath opened the bathroom door for him and his friend Mike, giving them an extra big smile as they entered.</p> <p>"How's tonight going?" he asked. He felt bad that it was over so early but he didn't have a chance to tell her how great it had been for him in a long time.</p> <p>"It's okay," she responded by pulling him into a hug that looked as though it had been a lifetime ago. "The love is still there."</p> <p>"That's sweet."</p> <p>"I'm just thankful that you took the time to talk with us. It was so hard to find someone that we could both relate to. It's hard to imagine that you two would have the heart to do this."</p> <p>"It's okay. We'll take it as deep as we can. We already have plans for tomorrow," Mike assured her.</p> <p>"We'll pick it up on the way," Mike said. He was smiling at the other side of the wall where Mike had been standing waiting for their friend to get inside his apartment all night.</p> <p>Mike smiled and pulled him into another hug. "Just let it go," he said.</p> <p>Korath hugged him. She was nervous about what may happen tomorrow and she was trying to get a handle on it as best she could in her limited and time out. The more she was able to give Mike all those little things about herself, the more she was glad thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
