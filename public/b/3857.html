But she couldn't leave him. She thought that she had seen him and that their relationship might be over now. "Oh, he's my boyfriend" she said.</p> <p>"Yes, you are sweetie."</p> <p>They kissed for a few minutes, each time thinking and laughing. Then his arm wrapped around her waist and he leaned down to kiss her. He kissed her softly, tasting his lips. He rubbed her arm against their bodies.</p> <p>"This is so sexy."</p> <p>He kissed her again and again, each time more passionately. She tried to lift her hands up to take him to her breasts but found, instead, she squeezed his buttock with her feet. He ground his erection into her stomach. "Why you've become so heavy."</p> <p>He pushed her on to her back again and lifted her hands to the back of his neck. She felt his fingers dig into her hands and heard his zipper go down. "Please put it in" she whispered. "I want your cock inside me."</p> <p>He leaned closer and moved her hands toward his waist. He took the belt of his shirt and gently pulled it over his head and off. Her fingers caressed the skin of his biceps, then his pecs. His nipples hardened under her touch. "Oh, God."</p> <p>"Is that why you want my body?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"I love your body." He took his right hand, then both, from her arms and slipped the straps of her bathing suit off her shoulders. He took the straps off her breasts, then he slowly peeled off her bathing suit. She stood there, a man in a bathing suit, standing bare breasted in front of her lover. Her body was the perfect combination of soft and hard.</p> <p>Dawn moved away to take the remainder of the suit over her shoulders. When she did, she stood there with her hands on her hips, legs slightly apart. For one final moment they held each other. He looked at her, the most beautiful, perfect, golden-brown skin surrounding her pale, flawless, porcelain skin. His gaze focused on her firm nipples. They were small but had been carefully trimmed.</p> <p>He leaned into her, pressing his lips against hers.</p> <p>"I want to taste you. I want what you've given me."</p> <p>He raised his arms over his head while he leaned forward and kissed her fully and passionately. Her hands found his chest, his stomach, then he felt two, then three, fingers entering her vagina. It was warm and wet, sopping wet, slippery. He pressed his lips to hers and moaned against her lips. He heard her gasp.</p> <p>His hands found her breasts, his fingers kneading the nipples, and his thumbs and fingers rubbed her belly, hips and thighs.</p> <p>"Oh, fuck baby! Oh, fuck!" The word, his lover's name escaped his lips, his tongue danced with hers. She could feel another orgasm building, building. She moaned into his mouth. "Yes! Yes, yes, yes! Oh my God!"</p> <p>He held her close while she went rigid on and on until she collapsed against the floor. He fell to the floor too, completely satisfied to stay there. The two of them lay there on the floor, both still breathing heavily. He put his arms around her and she was still shaking but felt so safe in his embrace.</p> <p>"I'll call you when we're ready to go againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
