His touch, the smell and warmth of his body were becoming too much to handle.</p> <p>I knew my pants were getting tight because my dick was throbbing and the friction against my jeans was getting me off. I had already unzipped myself, reached down and began to rub my hot cock. I knew I wouldn't last long.</p> <p>I was lost in the sensations of pleasure.</p> <p>As if I hadn't already lost control!</p> <p>It wasn't long, then, before the whole world became dark and a feeling took over my body.</p> <p>"Oh god! Oh god! Oh god! More!" I kept up a steady chant of fuck-me's, "You're too much!" I managed to call as I came hard and deep with wave after wave of pleasure. Wave after wave of pure ecstasy overtook me. I was exhausted and lay back, my body still trembling. I knew I had won. I could have gone on forever if it meant he would give me the chance again, but that was what happened. I gave in and lay back, looking into his brown-blue eyes. A deep sigh escaped me. "Thank you, sir. I'll tell you again when I wake up tomorrow," I said.</p> <p>He took my hand and gave me the finger-wrestling he'd held when we got married and was now massaging. We kissed and held each other as he turned and walked from the room.</p> <p>"You're up early, aren't you?" I called out after him.</p> <p>He ignored me and walked to the desk, picked up all the dirty papers and left them in a corner. He opened the drawer and withdrew something he'd just brought home with him.</p> <p>I couldn't see what it was at first. "Why?" I managed.</p> <p>He leaned closer and whispered. "We need to go shopping tonight. Do you want to show me your new purchases?"</p> <p>I had been too busy with my day to see what he had brought with him and, as if I was a child, I replied, "I think that would be a good idea."</p> <p>We kissed again. "You do look good in those."</p> <p>"Thank you," he answered with a smile. "Maybe we can make some breakfast."</p> <p>Without thinking I answered, "That sounds great."</p> <p>We went to his office and I found him with several different kinds of fruit and vegetables for me, some kind of fresh fish they had picked up for me, and some hotdogs for dinner. We ate and he was still talking before I noticed I was no longer sitting at my table.</p> <p>"Oh well." I answered. "Perhaps next time it will be more like a picnic."</p> <p>He looked surprised. "Maybe I'll have to start planning for it."</p> <p>I smiled. "I don't think you will, but for now, it will be fine."</p> <p>"It's really good to have you here with me. You gave me a lot to think about."</p> <p>I was glad we had a family day ahead and to be young, ready and eager to experience the joys of sex.</p> <p>We left his office and went home. "I think I'll call you tomorrow, okay?" he said, "By the way, I'd love to get a chance to take you shopping."</p> <p>"No, let's not go anywhere together. It's important to me that we have a good time." I told him.</p> <p>"Good. I really enjoyed you today," he said with a smile.</p> <p>"It will be nice to know I can make up my mind whether I want to spend the rest of my life with you or without this experience."</p> <p>"I'll make sure we have a good time tomorrow."</p> <p>I looked at him and smiled. I was pleased with him.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>My marriage to Tina was about to go crazy and I was happy to have the opportunity to spend time with her. After many weeks of dating she became my best friend. I kept a close eye on her and she kept an eye on me.</p> <p>My one week off from Tina meant that I could spend a while in her company. I often wondered what her husband had been up to, but had no idea if he had actually done anything. My hopes were quickly dashed when, a new customer had arrived at our place. We got him to let us in. One afternoon Tina was sitting on the couch drinking coffee with a cup of tea watching a football game on television. Her husband was sitting in a chair next to her. I heard her say, "Hi, honey," and then realized then she was talking to me. There had never been a question as to whether to go in to our bedroom for sex. It was just a casual thing. No demands on my partâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
