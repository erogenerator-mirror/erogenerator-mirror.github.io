"It's because we have been trying to get you to stay out of our group sex life," she said "but you kept pushing, asking, pleading. I knew she wanted me to be more assertive, to not be controlling, and to keep control for you."</p> <p>Before I could reply, she jumped up, gave me a quick kiss, and spun around while she walked towards her room.</p> <p>I waited by the pool naked in the moonlight until she returned. I was surprised to find her still standing there with a smile on her face. I asked her what was wrong but she just said that she missed me. She didn't say much else as she picked up the drinks off the night table and took a drink of the vodka. I watched as she moved over to kiss me tenderly on the lips.</p> <p>"That made me feel better," she said, "You kissed me so good I can't describe how good it makes me feel."</p> <p>I held on to her and pulled her tight against me. I kissed her deeply and passionately, my hands exploring her hot body. As far as I was concerned, I knew she had no regrets about our night of sexual excitement the previous night.</p> <p>My hands went to her breasts, squeezing her flesh, feeling her nipples harden and push against my palms. I continued to kiss her, pushing my tongue between her lips and into her body.</p> <p>"I've missed you so much," she confessed with a smile.</p> <p>"Me too, honey," I replied. "Now I want to take you home," I said, releasing her from the kiss.</p> <p>She moved to go to the couch, but I stopped her. "No, wait here," I said. "I'll come get you right away."</p> <p>I took my coat off, hung it up then grabbed a towel and led her to the front door. As I closed the door, I turned to face her.</p> <p>"Is this alright?" I asked.</p> <p>"Sure," she said, "just don't take too long... I'm aching to have you inside me now that you're inside me."</p> <p>"Okay," I said as I opened her coat and began to stroke my cock, "Come on!"</p> <p>We made a quick stop at my hotel room before we got undressed and I helped her get into bed naked. As we lay on our sides next to each other, looking into the dark, I realized that I didn't feel exactly ashamed of what happened. I loved it! I loved making her feel good! That didn't seem to bother me at all. It just turned me on so much that I could see myself do the same to her, touching and sucking on her sensitive nipples! When we started to make out, I knew I would have a difficult time resisting those new pleasures. When I finally put my mouth on her pussy, the next thing I felt was a strong pair of lips and tongue working to make her climax all over my face.</p> <p>"Oh my!" I said. I couldn't believe I just watched this.</p> <p>"I saw you looking and knowing your wife has been enjoying sex with your best friend right then," she said with a laugh.</p> <p>"Do you have a thing for me?" I asked as I licked the length of her clit, making her tremble with delight!</p> <p>"As far as I've gotten before," she said, "but it always felt good to just look at her. It's nice to watch her have sex. Now, I want you on top. If you're going to lick me to orgasm while I watch you, I don't want to disappoint you. Are you sure there isn't something you'd rather do?"</p> <p>"Of course, honey." I said, "I'll be right back."</p> <p>As I returned to the end of the bed, she was lying on her back with one leg over the side and her feet on the floor. I got on top of her, positioned my shaft at her opening then slowly pushed it in. She didn't even ask what I was going to make her do, only asked what I wanted her to tell me as she moaned and pushed with her hips against me. I didn't have to be asked again.</p> <p>As I continued to slowly fuck into her, she began to move her hips inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
