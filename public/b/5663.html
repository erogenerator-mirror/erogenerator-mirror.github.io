I love it when you cum like that, and this time it won't be so hard to control yourself."</p> <p>I can recall hearing a rustling then his hard cock slamming into me and hearing the sound of him hitting my cervix. A moment later there was a smack, a hard smack! I gasped, "Oh yeah!"</p> <p>He fucked me long and hard. The heat between my legs was like the warm glow that a night of lovemaking should be. My juices were flowing freely as I felt his thickness thrusting into me with each thrust. I felt my body go wild and quiver, as the pleasure built higher within me, and then it burst like a fire through my soul. I bucked and I thrashed under him as I came, and then I collapsed on the bed.</p> <p>For a moment, he lay beside me, his weight pressing me down, his hard cock twitching inside me with each spasm. I reached down and grabbed hold of him and stroked along the length of him and into the deepest parts of my being. Waves of ecstasy rolled over me as I stroked and caressed him, my own cock still hard and throbbing, the veins standing out on the sides and the blood coursing down from my body to my cock head. My body was alive with passion and with it was the sensation between my thighs. When I turned back to look back at the bed I thought I could see the bed rocking back and forth in the throes of passion and I wondered how many times I'd managed to get my hands or fingers up me to orgasm this way.</p> <p>I heard him chuckle again. "You did say you liked to fuck my hard!"</p> <p>It was true, but this time when I saw he was still hard I realized how much I was liking it. I was already wondering if the bed had been a good place to cum because I was on the verge of another intense orgasm when he kissed me. Just as he started to roll off me I felt the bed move again, and then I felt the hard cock that had been up me move up my body and then it was back inside. For a moment I couldn't tell which was which, but either way we were both lost in the pleasure and as he picked up the rhythm, my legs fell open and closed around him tightly. For a moment it felt like there was one in between us and then the intensity increased. He moved his body to make sure that he still hit all the places I loved having touched and even better I realized that there were only now times when I enjoyed that feeling. My back arched as he fucked me with a strong purpose and it felt good.</p> <p>All during our fucking I had had several dreams of us getting together, with my boss being the one coming to me with the details of that meeting.</p> <p>As I lay next to him I heard my boss say, "And what would happen then, when he gets into that meeting, just where in the hell is Jim?"</p> <p>I said, "He'll tell you just what would happen."</p> <p>The room grew quiet, with only the sound of my boss's breathing. I knew that he would soon be there, and that he would think of me as a person and have the idea that I wasn't human. My cock had never really gone away, nor did it ever become hard before. Not so it had not been when we had made love together when we had been married. Now it was becoming a thing of beauty, and when it was hard it was a beautiful thing.</p> <p>The second half of our fuck went on like that for awhile, and while we were at it we were both getting close to orgasm as we got close. After some more time for awhile it seemed like Jim and I came together for a long time. "Do you want to do each other again?" he asked me.</p> <p>"I don't think so...."</p> <p>"I think you need to know, that if I told you that I would do it at least twice as often as I had just been fucked, that's twice as often as I'll probably want to do you," he said.</p> <p>"Oh, I'll be the judge of that decision...." I said without much enthusiasm in my voice.</p> <p>"Why don't you tell me then," he said as he started to stroke his cock again.</p> <p>"I don't even know what to think," I said, "And we're going to have our little talk tonight and tonight only. The choice is yours!"</p> <p>"Just remember what I said about what I said about being my man...."</p> <p>At this point I knew that Jim and I were going to be lovers, and that I now might have the choice to be or not. I said, "You're not my man."</p> <p>"Why not?" Jim saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
