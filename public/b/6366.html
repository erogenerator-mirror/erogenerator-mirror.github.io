He knew he was too close to losing to a girl in high school to risk a date by being stupid when he'd watched the videos. The way it seemed, the girls who'd watched the videos often seemed to be so turned on, so turned on it was embarrassing.</p> <p>That meant that the guys who were there watching wouldn't have to go up to a chick at all to talk to her and kiss her and talk to her about anything other than what her body was worth to him.</p> <p>It was just hard enough that once you were there he couldn't stop himself. Even now just thinking of her, she'd be worth his time. She'd be perfect for him. Of course she wouldn't have sex with him because he didn't want her because he wouldn't give her the time of day. She would be a part of his life, maybe just as much as all his fantasies were. They didn't have to get a girl to be his, he wouldn't force himself on a virgin girl who'd be too timid for him.</p> <p>Maybe it didn't matter how he felt. He wouldn't have to worry about having someone else with him if she was still worth watching after she'd been so far and was really enjoying herself. He could be doing this forever.</p> <p>"Oh shit!" he muttered to himself. "This is really hard." He took a sip of his wine. "I mean she did it!"</p> <p>He was so lost in thought, he hadn't even heard his sister get up to get up. And then he saw her come over.</p> <p>"Hi, I was just thinking that maybe you'd like to join me downstairs for lunch sometime?" He saw her shake her hair as she asked, and it looked like maybe she was trying to make sure she looked at him.</p> <p>"Sure!" he stammered. Why did he have to be so lame? "What'd you think?"</p> <p>"You're a nerd!" She said, but that was true.</p> <p>"A nerd! And you've seen these videos!"</p> <p>"What?" she asked, then stopped in mid-stride and looked directly at him. "They're really hot?"</p> <p>"Yep!" he was shocked. The whole time he was thinking of trying to talk to her.</p> <p>She leaned over and gave him an embrace so he took her in his arms. "Well, I'd really enjoy seeing those." She said as she rubbed his chest. "You can get me some pictures of my mom and dad!" Her voice had a mischievous way it sounded. He felt like he was going to pop over and start kissing the girl right there in front of all the guys at school. "Let's have lunch before the movie, like I said, let you know what to do."</p> <p>"Alright!" he said as he stood up and grabbed his pants. "I'm gonna hit the shower in a minute."</p> <p>"Alright!" she said as she stood up and followed him out. Then he heard the shower go on again. After he closed the door, he grabbed some clothes and headed upstairs. He didn't know what was on TV, but he knew that he wanted to do it. He went right to his bedroom, and changed before returning to the computer. It wasn't until he was on the laptop that he realized that it was his own laptop. He grabbed that and used it. There was no way to type, but he could open Google and find a way to talk on the laptop instead of the phone. He was pretty certain that it turned out to be the worst possible connection, or worse than that, but he didn't have enough money to take the whole thing. In fact, it wasn't like he didn't have the money to get a decent home for himself.</p> <p>On the computer his friends would be so impressed with this thing if they could just open the box like you did. It was the one thing that they could ask about their friends' internet history - how they were reading.</p> <p>He didn't say anything until he heard the water running. He sat and watched the screen on the computer, and decided that he'd probably be able to take much worse chances than taking it if she wanted to. He could just say something to her. He could just show her some stuff. It would be more difficult than if she did, but she would just have to trust him and let him know what she really wanted.</p> <p>Then he changed the password. "This is just like the other day," he thought. "And maybe it takes something better away!"</p> <p></p> <p>It went quiet for a while. She didn't notice the clock onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
