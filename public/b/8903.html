If I was a guy, I would want it very badly. I could kiss you in the street in New Orleans. I would love to be your lover, my soul mate."</p> <p>She stood up and moved to him and kissed him and then she whispered, "I love you, my sweet man."</p> <p>The next morning they had a lovely brunch in the city park. A young couple had a picnic basket. Both were dressed in bathing suits. They had brought clothes for when they went to the shore. They talked for about an hour. They had a lot to say about their work. They shared how successful, how happy they were and how they were on the road again. They spent the entire picnic at a park a couple miles south.</p> <p>They spent another hour in a state park near the shore. She was happy because it reminded her of where she was going this week. She felt happy the way they were and she loved the day. She loved the way they were going. She thought of him every time she thought about him. She thought of him every time she was naked except a thin towel or something. She thought of their conversation over breakfast. She wondered if he noticed. She thought of the way he loved her breasts. He had made her nipples get harder. He had used his teeth and tongue on them. She thought of how he had taken them for his pleasure.</p> <p>She knew she had to be careful. But she also knew that the next time she saw him, she loved him. She thought of the way he said, "Thank you," and carried on with the next time they would go swimming. She knew he would remember that. They talked a lot on the way to the shore and even talked like friends.</p> <p>He was still a little unsure of her but he agreed that she looked good naked. He wasn't in the mood to go swimming naked at the beach. They sat on the blanket on his lap. His hand had found her breast and was feeling it. She was enjoying being with him and the conversation. His hand roamed up her leg and he found her slit. She was already wet, so warm under his expert touch. He started to stroke her gently between the lips of her pussy. He knew this would help her relax and she enjoyed it. He loved to slide a finger into her tight pussy. He teased her clit with it before he slipped it in and out. She was wet and so he finger fucked her a little first then added another finger. He got her in a state she thought he would never think of as sex play. She loved being touched and loved the sensations of it. She had never had this before. She was feeling herself close to orgasm, but he seemed not to notice. She was in a dream state when they sat back up. She looked into his eyes and said, "Will it get better? I mean, I know it is different now."</p> <p>He thought about what she said and said but he wanted to enjoy all of her. He wanted to be with her, make love to her. He wanted to make a connection. He knew she felt the same way. There had to be something else. Why now? Why now?</p> <p>As she said the phrase 'just can't wait to try' he could sense that her mind would be working on her pussy at the moment. He could sense it on his dick! He didn't even wonder about the possibility of a dick going into her pussy. She was going places where one finger might if she needed it. He knew it would never work with him. He thought that if she was open to it, she would enjoy it. He knew that she enjoyed the game. They would just need to find a way to work them up to it. He had just as much at stake as her that way. It didn't matter. She would never want to cheat on him or cheat on him. She might want things to work out and it would be easy.</p> <p>She loved the first time she had sex with a man. She told him about it. They talked about it often. But it was just a fantasy. They never acted on it though. They had made love some of the time over the summer but never with a real cock inside of what they were doing. Now they were doing it in the park in the park near their home. This was going to be one of the most exciting sex sessions they had ever had together.</p> <p>That afternoon they returned to her house without seeing each others faces. She told him that they had better clean up and change out of their bathing suits. It was her body she wanted to feel when she was naked and then take it off for him.</p> <p>He stripped too and they spent a little time on their lovemaking again just as they had at the park. It was beautiful. She told him she liked how he kept talking aboutâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
