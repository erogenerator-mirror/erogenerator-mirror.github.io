I'm getting a headache just remembering, "I thought. I had just sat back on the bed and leaned back and looked at the ceiling.</p> <p>Now I had some good news. I'd had a conversation with Jim, and I didn't want to end it for him! I wasn't having sex with Tony, I was just listening to him.</p> <p>I could feel myself being drawn back into the dream. Tony had told his friend that he'd been playing a game, and it had really turned me on, and I'd had the urge to jump and touch his cock.</p> <p>I opened my mouth and slowly moved my hand toward him. I felt my hand touch something and stopped, and the feeling quickly returned. I started to stroke him slowly and then stopped again. Oh well, I thought, no more time, and continued to caress him.</p> <p>Now I didn't know if I'd actually stopped stroking him before I'd gone too far, but I kept it up, and I could feel his hands on mine as I stroked.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah, that feels good" He moaned. "Mmmmmm that tickles" I moaned.</p> <p>I stopped again, and felt him move his hips. I kept stroking him and then I stopped again. This time I couldn't be wrong about it, and I felt him lift his hips again, and I felt his hand on my shoulder.</p> <p>Suddenly I was standing up, and he was holding me close and whispered softly in my ear "Do you remember?" I could see the smile on his face and felt myself relax back onto the bed.</p> <p>Looking back at him I couldn't tell if he'd heard, but I could see him looking at me as he spoke.</p> <p>"Ya know, I've been wondering what you do for a while now", I heard him say.</p> <p>I just smiled and reached back and pulled the pillow over our heads. Tony then reached over me and pulled one sheet back down in between me and the bed. I raised with him, and we each spread the sheet completely across the bed. He pulled me to him.</p> <p>"Ya knew I was going to try something here?" He asked me.</p> <p>"Maybe" I said as I reached down and pulled off my clothes. We didn't need to look.</p> <p>I sat on the bed, and he pulled him to me. As he did it I could feel his erection pressing against the sheets under me. I lay back, and he pulled me up with him. I felt him slide a couple of the buttons of my blouse from off my shoulders and let it drop on the bed beside us.</p> <p>He reached behind me and unzipped my slacks, pulled them off. I hadn't really thought about letting him undress me, but if he wanted to I was game for anything. He slowly pushed my panties down and as I did he ran his fingers over my pubic bone, and down the valley. It felt so delicious. When it was finally over the top of my thighs the heat from his touch was almost unbearable.</p> <p>I was panting now. I raised my legs, then held them up for him. His hand stroked my pussy from behind, and he gently parted my pussy lips with one finger to open it wider. I felt him dip his finger into me and was pleased and excited, as I heard myself moan. I wanted so much to be filled, but somehow had to remain sitting on the edge and facing him.</p> <p>He worked his finger a little farther inside me and I felt my pussy lips opening even wider and contracting. I almost came again when the pressure on my clit, and the moisture I was already so wet was making me so horny I didn't want to go over the edge yet.</p> <p>He stopped and turned me around to straddle his lap. I felt the pressure on my clit and the pressure against the tip of me as we both watched the show.</p> <p>"If this is what it feels like to have someone else, then you should too", I told him as I pushed down on his throbbing erection.</p> <p>My pussy was incredibly soft and slippery. As I worked myself with his erection it felt like velvet caresses, moving so wonderfully and stimulating all at once.</p> <p>"You still haven't told me how you really feel about this too", he teased me as he leaned forward and took in what I was doing to myself.</p> <p>"Oh, I don't know about that", I said as I pushed down harder, "we can try something else".</p> <p>It felt amazing. I was leaning back on my elbows. He pulled me to him and he reached around to hold my body close. He moved his hips inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
