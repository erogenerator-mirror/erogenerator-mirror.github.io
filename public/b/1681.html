Sam whispered into my ear as we kissed.</p> <p>"You're home." I smiled.</p> <p>"Is it okay?"</p> <p>"Is it alright?"</p> <p>"Yes. Please have another drink with me, Sam." I whispered, my face turned down to the floor.</p> <p>She got off of me and came over to where she was sitting on the floor; I put my arm around her shoulder, and we got up and sat down together.</p> <p>"This isn't your fault." I whispered to her, kissing her gently.</p> <p>"I know. I'm the one that caused it though." She smiled.</p> <p>"It isn't your fault as you are doing it to me." I replied.</p> <p>"You can stop talking like that." She smiled.</p> <p>"That's okay. I'm not going to stop talking, now."</p> <p>"Hannah, you are the one who caused it."</p> <p>"Yes." She sighed.</p> <p>"You're not going to stop loving me." I whispered, "You're not going to stop loving me. I'm not going to stop loving you until our marriage goes down the tubes. I will never love you the way you love me now."</p> <p>"But I love you." She whispered back.</p> <p>"I love you too."</p> <p>At that moment Hannah's phone rang, she looked at the display, then looked back at me.</p> <p>"Is it important?" She whispered.</p> <p>"I can answer it." I whispered to her, and then handed it to Sam.</p> <p>"Hello, Sam." Hannah answered my message, and handed the phone back to me.</p> <p>"Hannah. It's Hannah."</p> <p>"Hannah what's wrong?" Sam asked me.</p> <p>"I don't understand what's happened to Sam."</p> <p>"She told me." Sam said, making a gesture with her hands.</p> <p>"Sam is in love with you." I said.</p> <p>"I know you two are lovers." Hannah smiled. "But, why?"</p> <p>"Sam loves me." I smiled at her.</p> <p>"And Sam loves you." Sam answered.</p> <p>"I think the truth is going to come out sooner rather than later. Hannah has a lot of questions for me about this. Will she still love me, can she?"</p> <p>"Of course she will." Sam assured her. "She wouldn't have sex with you if you weren't in love with you. Will she love you enough to love me enough to love me?"</p> <p>"Oh Sam. I love her. I never want her to be happy and want me for herself, I love her and want her to love me, and love me." Sam paused before continuing.</p> <p>"So Hannah can love you, even if your parents don't find out she loves you." Sam said. "I think the only thing she can do is ask you to love her, not your husband."</p> <p>"Hannah loves me." I whispered to her, "she wants me, she's in love with me."</p> <p>"I love her too." Sam whispered to me.</p> <p>"You'll love them no matter what."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"I'll talk to Sam and I'll tell her, she knows it." Sam said.</p> <p>"Sam, can you explain last night, to Hannah?"</p> <p>"Yeah, she's in love with you and thinks it's about time to make a move, isn't that right?"</p> <p>"Uh huh." Sam replied. "I'm thinking about the proposal you have." She stopped for a moment. "Well, I'm not sure, and I certainly wasn't ready to commit to anything until you were there with me, but yes, I think there is. I was kind of nervous, but the minute we said it, I was thrilled and proud you and I could share our relationship with someone that I love very deeply. That isn't something I can live with my parents, but if she goes out with Hannah, it doesn't bother me as much."</p> <p>"Hannah has already made the right choice in her life."</p> <p>"I know, I'm not sure the answer to that." She smiled, "But I guess you were right too."</p> <p>"That's the only thing I meant."</p> <p>"Okay, I'm going to talk to her now, okay?"</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"Hannah and I have a plan." I smiled.</p> <p>"We have a plan?"</p> <p>"Yeah, the plan is going to start right now." I smiled.
