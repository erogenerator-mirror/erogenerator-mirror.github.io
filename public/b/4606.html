A few hours later, we were getting ready to go out to dinner and she was ready to go out again, but she was still trying to pull out of me. I was trying to figure out where the next move might be. This was a situation I'd never have considered when I started in on my wife and I was now trying to figure things out.</p> <p>"Just keep dreaming," I said to her. "Maybe, if I didn't know better, I'd think for a minute I was dreaming about you."</p> <p>"I do know better, and if I could have my way, you could never have given back what you'd made me. Don't make this easy on me," she said, with a little more confidence.</p> <p>"You're not going to win, I'm just going to have to take you down," I said.</p> <p>"I've lost every fight I've ever had before in my life, and here you are. Let's try something else," she said. "How about we hit the back of this little alley and let our luck take us. I'll have a good time and, if you're up for it, you can pick your own outfit."</p> <p>"What did you say?" I asked her, trying my best to sound as confident as my ex.</p> <p>"If you don't pick something else, this alley's yours," she said, with a laugh. "Besides, I'm going to have a nice time tonight. I don't want you getting into the wrong clothes."</p> <p>"Okay, I've always thought you were a hot one," I said, as I led her in the opposite direction.</p> <p>"Just look around," she said. "I don't mind sharing my luck in return if you think I'm cute."</p> <p>"If you say so," I replied. "Are you sure this is something you want to do with me?"</p> <p>"This is your lucky week, so let's see if it's anything but," she said. "And you better put that tongue to work while we're eating."</p> <p>"Okay," I said.</p> <p>"What about if I ask you to do something for me tonight, so we don't have to do it out here?" she asked, as she went back to her table and was serving herself another bowl.</p> <p>I think I said a few things that might have been asked out in that tone. It was time to get down to some serious business.</p> <p>To Be Continued....</p> <p>Thanks, Freddie for your help and feedback. As always, it's my sincere hope that you enjoy the storyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
