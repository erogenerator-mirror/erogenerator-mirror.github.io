I blurted as I realized I was busted. I could barely breathe. I'd not meant it to be so...weird.</p> <p>I glanced down at my cock, feeling it swelling inside the folds of my shorts and realized...not only was I boned...it was time to take this trip! I thought to myself to shake my head. 'No' my mind snapped before I turned my face back to my friend. "I'm sorry," I said, realizing I had been just inches from him as he looked down at me, his eyes bright with surprise - and lust. "Sorry, wasn't to be mean."</p> <p>He glanced up from the paper he was reading. "It was what I meant," he said. "I really do want to see you naked...," he paused, and then his face scrunched up with anger, "not the one who just fucked me."</p> <p>I took my friend's hand and we turned slowly away. He was practically shaking. We stood in the hallway, hand in hand. His words just spilled out so slowly, so silently, that my dick didn't register. I couldn't imagine any normal man hearing them...our words of affection.</p> <p>He pulled me into his arms and hugged me tight. I felt safe in his arms...in his love...in his confidence. My head was spinning, my heartbeat hard. He ran his hands over me, feeling my nakedness, his skin, memorizing it as it was exposed by my clothes. He unbuttoned my shirt and slipped it off, tossing it over onto the end of the bed in the back corner of the room.</p> <p>He reached down and pulled me to him, crushing me against him as he kissed me, his soft lips tasting as he kissed me. I felt his body heat through my clothes, and I knew it was the first time since our first date we had been in an intimate moment together, since my parents had divorced us, and the first time we had kissed when we were kids...our first real and passionate kiss...he pulled away, breaking our kiss. He looked at me, his eyes wild with lust. And then the look went from fear, to desire, to desire, to lust, to lust.</p> <p>We broke off our kiss quickly, our breathing uneven. "Turn around," he said, his hand sliding up to the back of my head as I turned my face toward him. I felt his hand slide around my neck while he wrapped his arms around my body, pulling me back against him, pressing his hard cock against me. He reached around me and unbuttoned my shorts, sliding them down until they were the only thing separating our bodies. He reached down and pulled my panties aside, spreading my legs open, my cock trapped between us. "Spread your legs," he told me.</p> <p>And when I did, he pressed his hard cock against me, then pressed it hard against me before moving it back and forth, rubbing it over my opening, touching my skin. He leaned down and brushed his lips across mine. Slowly...slowing. Slowly...teeth rubbing against lips...he pressed his lips to mine, parting us slightly.</p> <p>He slowly backed away until he was right beside me. Slowly I felt his hand touch my lower back then slide up under my shirt, cupping my naked breast, his finger massaging my nipple slowly. His hand continued down and he pressed firmly against my cock again. He slowly slid that hand up my body, pressing it against my cock. This time I felt it pressing between my thighs, slowly moving upward through the length of my body. His hand felt so good sliding over me...and I could feel his fingers gliding against my skin, softly at first, then with more frantic, feeling it start to work its way up between my lips...my cock pressing against him... my stomach moving as it moved along mine...</p> <p>With that, he took both of my hands, pulling me toward him while slowly rolling his body over mine. He was laying beside me and his shirt lifted up over his head and his face fell to mine as he kissed me, his mouth opening for mine as our tongues played back and forth inside each other's mouth. This was different....this was tender, this was love, this was a lust as his tongue found mine again and we each came together in a mind-blowing, mind-blowing kiss...all this time feeling the intensity growing between us. The sensation and emotions rising as his lips sucked mine...the heat of my lips...the wetness of his kiss...the taste of him on me...the sound of his voice as he softly stroked my face and my body....</p> <p>His hand had strayed down between his legs now, slowly making its way to my cock. He rubbed my length through the fabric of my jeans, feeling it move against his hand, teasing me, feeling his arousal.
