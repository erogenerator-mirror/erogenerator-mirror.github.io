I'm quite used to this. I mean, it's usually pretty routine for a married lady in her own home with two children. But to tell you the truth, I'm not surprised that you're in this condition."</p> <p>"What?" I asked in shock.</p> <p>"Just as much to be honest" she smiled at me, her eyes returning to mine. "And honestly, I'm surprised that you're not already going to be in this condition."</p> <p>"What? You're kidding me!" I replied, my stomach twisting in knots. It must have shown as the look of a child in front of her, as she quickly picked up her phone, quickly dialed a number, and hung up. She turned back to me to tell me what was going on when I suddenly realized that there was no way I was gonna be the one who could give her anything more than a foot massage. But that would be a huge mistake.</p> <p>To the best of my knowledge, I didn't get the chance to see what she was wearing that morning. A nice pair of blue bikini panties adorned her thighs and crotch and looked very similar to the ones I had seen in the store a few minutes before. I couldn't help but take note when she pulled them up over those legs and the other time I had seen her with a bikini on, though, I couldn't be sure of the situation. My cock was now rock hard and straining in my shorts.</p> <p>"Are you wearing a bra this morning?" she asked, looking over at me.</p> <p>"I'm not sure." I lied. I wasn't sure she noticed, then noticed that she was staring at me with intense interest. "I think I just needed a bit of a distraction." I said, looking away from her. "It's getting a bit hard to keep away from the heat."</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she said, quickly looking away from me again again. "Please forgive me."</p> <p>"No, really. It's nothing inappropriate on my part. It's just, it's too...well, I haven't exactly been feeling well in a long time." I took a bite of my food.</p> <p>"What is?" she asked, looking away before adding. She leaned closer to me, her skin touching mine, and I could feel her warm breath on my neck. Her breath was so soft, so intimate. It made me tingle. She leaned forward and I felt her breasts press against my chest, her nipples poking my upper chest as she pressed closer, her hard nipples grazing my skin.</p> <p>"Well..." I began slowly, still keeping my mouth shut. "You look...exciting", I managed before being cut off by her lips on mine, slipping hers into mine, and feeling the heat from both of us. She pulled back, looking at me with her beautiful brown eyes, and her eyes widened as she pulled back once again, letting me feel the heat of her lips on mine.</p> <p>"Oh wow", she said, again smiling. "I can't believe you think the way you do!" She laughed, leaning closer to me. She slid one hand down to grip both my nipples as she leaned back in and pressed her body back against mine, my cock throbbing beneath us. She pressed her lips against mine, our tongues dancing, our hands quickly finding each other's breasts. She kissed me as she pulled me closer, her body hot against mine, her lips and tongue driving me wild. I reached down to grope her ass in my hands, my fingers sliding through the soft skin and under her panties at her crotch.</p> <p>"You know," she began, before breaking off the kiss. "if there is anything you'd like, you can have the massage" She said, her hand running my hand over the other side of her body, squeezing her breasts as I squeezed her ass.</p> <p>"Really?" I asked, looking up at her. "What do you want?"</p> <p>"Well, it could be your time off and we could just have a quick shower, like...I could wash this stuff off of you? Or, can it be something special? What do you think?"</p> <p>"Well, for you to say "well, you could give me a nice massage like I asked you for", I should go into a little more detail, she thought. "But I think my wife is pretty ticked she didn't even mention letting this happen."</p> <p>"It is not exactly your wife it's just my wife."</p> <p>"Doesn't matter, I am just getting to know it."</p> <p>"So are you, and I mean that in a very serious way. You know, it's really kind of fun to try," I replied, reaching up to touch her cheek.</p> <p>"I could hardly have taken the bait", she repliedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
