"What the hell." I thought. I slid out of my seat and moved under the table like I were going to sit in there. I looked over, and my wife was there. She had that smile that all men know and loves - a smile that says, "I'm there, so you'll be there." Then she waved back at me from a table.</p> <p>"We're closed," my wife said, trying to make it sound normal, "Can we order now?"</p> <p>"We're closed," I replied back, "The waiter is in the next one."</p> <p>I could feel the moisture starting to seep from my pants, making it difficult to drive. My pulse was racing. "Is there anyway to take your pants off, when you're not in a hurry?" my wife asked.</p> <p>"Probably some other place," I said, "just for now."</p> <p>She looked down to see my pussy, and said, "Let her do it. She's got to know what to do with it."</p> <p>The waiter walked up and took my hand, pulling me to my feet. I turned back to face my wife, who was leaning on the counter with her legs spread wide. "I'm going to fuck you. You're going to fuck the waiter."</p> <p>I watched as she grabbed our waiter and put him on his back. Then I watched, as she unzipped her skirt, and slid it down. I could see the front was wet, and I could see that the waiter had a big hard cock just waiting to be freed from its cage, and I smiled to myself. I wanted my husband's cock in me so badly and so much it was all I could do to resist. I pushed my fingers inside my panties, and moved my wet pussy onto my husband's erection, pushing it inside me and rubbing it against my clit. I smiled to myself as I saw her push back and I felt his cock slide inside me.</p> <p>"I like the way you like my pussy," I said to my husband as he reached down and massaged my clit between his fingers.</p> <p>I bent forward a little, feeling his cock slide out of me, and I said, "Do you like fucking the waiter?"</p> <p>"God yes, baby," he told me, "Your pussy is so good."</p> <p>"Do you like to feel me get fucked," I asked him, knowing that I was the only question on his mind, and he nodded. "Good answer," I said to my husband as I started pulling on my clit. I closed my eyes and slid my finger faster inside me as I imagined us both being fucked.</p> <p>The waiter started moving his cock in and out of my pussy as if it could be anyone else. He was sliding his cock in and out of my pussy with great abandon, and his hands were grabbing my ass as he fucked me. As if you'd ask if I was going to get his cock hard again, he said, "I think we'll make this a threesome," and his eyes rolled right up into his head. Then he started to move faster inside me. He held my hips as he pulled out and then slid back in, hard and fast. "God, I'm going to blow and cum any second." He told me, and I could hear myself moan just a few feet away. I pushed my fingers as hard as I could to force him to cum with me. My whole body was tingling. I could go on. I could fuck him. I looked to see my husband fucking the waiter. My husband's balls were moving like crazy, I heard him moaning, and I could see that the waiter was really fucking the waiter now, as he held my hips, and the waiter was pounding against my clit. I could almost hear my husband's voice in my ear, as if he were talking to me and saying dirty things. It made me think that he was going to cum any second.</p> <p>I started yelling, like a cat, "I can't take it anymore. I'm going to fuck your brains out." I opened my head, and the waiter was standing over me. He was holding my hair and guiding his cock from my mouth down to my cunt. "Oh God," I yelled to the guy I didn't recognize as my husband, "Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me good." I was still thinking that it didn't matter, and I felt his cock as it slid inside me. I looked at the face of the guy that fucked the waiter and I could see that his eyes were wide open, and I knew that he liked what my husband had done as well. I felt him get even harder and then I could see it shoot into my wife's pussy, and all over my stomach. He was cumming inside meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
