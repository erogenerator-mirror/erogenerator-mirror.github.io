Scott said.</p> <p>"Wow," she said, "that makes sense." She stared at him thoughtfully.</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm sorta used to it." Scott told her, taking a sip of his bourbon.</p> <p>"Well," she said, "I really did say I didn't want to get involved with you yet, and I've been thinking I just might."</p> <p>Scott paused for a moment to think. "I uh...well...."</p> <p>"No, don't say that sweetie," she said, "I'm not upset because I'm not...oh, you know...."</p> <p>Scott didn't know what to say, she suddenly seemed very serious, and he wasn't sure what to make of it. He had no experience with girls, but this girl...what the hell was she looking at? It was like she had someone inside her that she was seeing as a sexual being...she was looking inside him. As much as he wondered if he was actually seeing her as a sexual being, he didn't want to feel like that. He didn't want to feel the pain of having an affair with someone that he couldn't be happy with. He was tired of fighting it.</p> <p>"Okay..." he said softly, "I'll see what I can do."</p> <p>"So what do you do for fun?" she asked, leaning over and taking his left hand in her as she took his glass from his other hand and put it back on the table.</p> <p>"I don't know how to describe it! I can't even start to." Scott said softly, "but I want to."</p> <p>"You'll probably find the right things for you to do." She said with a smile. She slowly took his hand and placed it on her thigh. Her skin seemed so much softer and warm. Scott didn't know it then, but his hand felt better. It was so smooth and soft that he wasn't entirely sure he was handling it like a proper hand. He slid his fingers up and down her thigh, letting it rest on the inside of her right thigh. It felt so silky, almost as soft as her skin.</p> <p>"Oh, that feels good." she said.</p> <p>Scott looked down and saw a damp patch in the front of her t-shirt.</p> <p>"I'm really glad you like it." Scott said. She smiled at him and began to run her fingers along his fingers. "It's only a touch." She continued. "If you don't want me to stop..."</p> <p>Scott couldn't believe it. He hadn't realized she was a little drunk...and the fact that he had started to feel this way...was actually beginning to turn him on. She continued. "I like to have fun" she said with a smile.</p> <p>Scott didn't know what to say. He had a feeling that she had never had any kind of sexual experience. And he had always had a thing for girls who had a lot of experience. But she certainly hadn't given any kind of sexual experience. He reached up and took her hand in his. She didn't move back and put it back on her hip, but then gave him another smile. He looked down at her, noting everything.</p> <p>"I'm not saying I don't want that thing inside me, though." she said.</p> <p>Scott stopped moving and looked at her questioningly, "you...you shouldn't."</p> <p>"Is that wrong?" she asked with a questioning look in her eyes. Scott looked down, his eyes looking down.</p> <p>"No, I guess not." he said quickly. She looked shocked at his statement, but didn't seem to notice.</p> <p>"It's just that you haven't had much experience with boys." she said quietly. She put her hand over his, and felt his hand on her thigh. Her skin was so soft and warm. Scott's hand was right where he thought it should be...he had never really looked at a woman's legs...he had always assumed they were smooth, and had never dreamed they felt smooth. She felt so young and pretty. She seemed so young and sweet. She reached down and grabbed his hand, "you know, you don't have to do anything you don't want to."</p> <p>Scott looked at her with a puzzled expression. He just couldn't think on that logic, because he couldn't have her saying that, either. When he looked down at her, she was looking up at him. It was an expression of concern and concern. He had never thought he could have an emotional attraction to a beautiful young thing.</p> <p>"It's okay," she saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
