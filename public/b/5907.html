I'd already fucked more than the girls, and a third woman had also made it clear that I was in a position to be rewarded. For just a brief moment, my eyes glanced at Tracey for approval, but she just smiled down at me before giving me a quick tug on my shirt collar, and leading me back towards the couch.</p> <p>"Let's get comfortable," she said as soon as I was seated, and I was just to take the opportunity to put my arms around her neck, and hold her.</p> <p>"Are you hungry?" she asked as she slid off her shoes and began to remove her socks.</p> <p>"Um, yeah, I was."</p> <p>"Me too, I think," she said as the fabric of her underwear fell to the floor, revealing the red satin bra covering her pert breasts, and I quickly dropped my arms to hide my burgeoning erection.</p> <p>"Come on, let's eat. You'll feel better if you eat."</p> <p>I couldn't disagree. Tracey led me to the nearest corner table, which we sat facing, and was soon joined by a tall, curvy blonde from somewhere across a room.</p> <p>"So you're the shy guy at the school?" I asked as I sipped my wine.</p> <p>"Oh, not really. Most of the male students are much more shy than the female students, and we're more interested in their looks."</p> <p>"What do I look like?" I asked.</p> <p>"Well, all I really need to know is what size breasts you like, which I know. It's hard to describe what size ass and pussy juice taste like."</p> <p>"No one has ever described it to me like that," I pointed out.</p> <p>"Come on, now. This is your friend," Tracey said to the blonde, who quickly walked over and gave me a friendly little squeeze on the butt cheek.</p> <p>"Are you sure that's what you want?" she asked me, as she gave me that little smile again.</p> <p>"Well, no. Not really, but let's not change the topic. Right now, I could definitely use some help from you as a roommate."</p> <p>"Sure, come on, sit down," she said. I walked slowly across the room with her as she sat down on my lap, and started rubbing my shoulders.</p> <p>We kept a close eye on each other as we sat and ate, and as soon as we finished eating, we both realized the tension we'd been having. The tension was gone from our relationship, and the excitement, even if just a little, had all but disappeared.</p> <p>"Let's start slow," Tracey said.</p> <p>I followed her instructions and she soon started massaging my shoulders, as she ran a hand along the line of my neck, down my shirt, and then gently massaged the front of my pants. As she began to unbutton the waistband, I slipped my hands over hers, which was a far cry from pulling them inside her blouse. Instead, I slowly eased her toward the end of the couch, and gently unbuttoned her blouse as she continued massaging along the inside of my right arm.</p> <p>"What are you so good at, Tonia?" Tracey whispered the words softly into my ear, as she ran a hand seductively through my hairline, which made me think of something I'd heard from my favorite rock band. I moved my other hand down over her waistline and found her panties, which I rubbed through for a little while as I pushed her legs apart.</p> <p>"You're a hot girl. You're one of those girls who just want to be loved."</p> <p>I knew what she meant. I felt that tension of this whole relationship building in my balls, like a tidal force. Without even realizing it, I reached under Tracey's skirt with both hands, and began toying with her clit with my fingertips.</p> <p>Tracey gasped slightly when I first touched her there, but soon the little "h-h-oh, oh, oh" came out of her lips as she grabbed my hands and put them on her stomach, my fingers barely skimming her skin, and her breath quickened again as I pushed her skirt up and onto her legs. Soon her panties were gone, and as I pulled her panties down slowly and gently, she spread her legs to allow me easier access, allowing my fingers to push up between her lips, as her moans became louder, and her knees started to shake. Before she'd finished this, I had her down on her bed, her moans turning into full screams as I continued my ministrations to her clit.</p> <p>Tonia and I had a quick, quick moment of intimacy, before Tracey, who already had an audience by the time we finished having sex, slid the door shut in the roomâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
