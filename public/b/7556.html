He replied with a smirk.</p> <p>They both chuckled a bit as they walked outside.</p> <p>"So if we can't go over it again, we could try a new dress and do it in the back..."</p> <p>"Oh...sure, why don't you?"</p> <p>"I think it would be better if we were more comfortable in public?" he joked.</p> <p>"Why can't we go shopping?" she suggested, as she stood in front of him looking at the dress he had picked out for them.</p> <p>"Then why don't we try it out in a store in the nude?" he asked.</p> <p>"I don't think so, the sun is out and I don't have anything to wear around me..." she said coyly.</p> <p>"Oh I see," was all James said as he reached out to help her stand, turning her to face him.</p> <p>"There is one thing..." his eyes quickly scanned her body, finally stopping at her breasts as she smiled back at him.</p> <p>"Yeah...I guess we had better not try to go shopping with nothing on under it," she laughed as she turned around to put it on, before turning around again, this time with the dress showing a hint of the bottom of her firm round bottom.</p> <p>"Come on baby, why do you need to try this in the nude?" he laughed as he watched the way her firm breasts seemed to sway sexily from side to side as she turned around.</p> <p>"I think you know why, I think you just need to change some things around," she replied. "Just stay there if you don't want to see me completely out of this dress." she giggled as she walked out to the front of the apartment and stood for a moment, waiting while he put the dress on.</p> <p>"Yeah, ok...just try to get the right way to change in here. Let's get back to the changing room before you wear it out. I'll put some makeup on you." James said as he helped her out of the dress. When he put the new dress on she had slipped her panties off before he handed it to her.</p> <p>"Thank you, that will really be worth it..." she said as she smiled shyly at him.</p> <p>"Come on honey, let's get back to the dressing room, this is going to be a while!" he yelled as he grabbed her hand.</p> <p>'I can't believe I'm doing this..." she thought as he kissed her hand and she followed him back into the apartment.</p> <p>In the dressing room, he quickly dropped her panties and began to put some makeup on her. "No, don't do that. I want to look good..." she laughed nervously as he leaned close and kissed her mouth. His tongue slid deep into her mouth, and then found hers. Her arms were tight around his neck as he pushed his tongue into her mouth, running his fingers through her soft brown hair while they stood nose to nose. They stood locked together for a moment before she felt him step back a bit and watched as he pulled her close to him for a short kiss. She felt his arms hug her even tighter against his chest, and she leaned into him as he pulled her body back against his.</p> <p>"Now go get the door for me." he commanded as he reached for the door knob.</p> <p>"Yes, baby!" she replied as she stepped into the hallway. It was obvious she was getting extremely wet, and it was beginning to be obvious if she kept up their little charade they were being watched by someone. All he could do is smile as she walked out the door, feeling a bit silly, but she didn't care because he could always turn back to them at any time to have the time of his life with his arms around the one hot and horny little thing who happened to be on the phone with a new friendâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
