I say. I was a little worried, but I wasn't doing anything to stop it.</p> <p>"Yes, baby, I want you to make love to me."</p> <p>"I don't know. You know how much I've had fantasising about you."</p> <p>"Please," I beg.</p> <p>"Don't be afraid, sweetheart. This is what you want. Do you know what you want?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Well," I answer. I'm kneeling on the bed with my body just inches from your lips, my breasts now just inches from your own flesh. For a brief moment our eyes lock. Slowly your face descends to mine, your kiss first on my lips then on my lower lip. You open your mouth over mine, your tongue slowly pushing out, teasing my mouth before gently probing my mouth. Your tongue flicks against mine. Our tongues meet and begin dueling. Your tongue enters my mouth and swirls around it. Your hand finds its way through my hair and pulls me towards you, your lips locking tight. Suddenly I feel your hand on my breast, your fingers wrapping around the small firm globes and your thumb is tugging on my nipple through my nightie. It's like an electric current surges through me until I moan and lift myself off of the bed. I move to a sitting position on the edge and we continue our kiss.</p> <p>"How's that for me?" I ask and you look over at me with a questioning look. "What do you think you're doing?"</p> <p>"This is what I want. I want you to kiss me"</p> <p>I'm still slightly nervous. I've never done it like this before, but knowing it's in your fantasies will cause a change. I take off the teddy and the negligee. You watch with hungry eyes as I run my hands down my tummy, sliding one hand under my panties, the other over a pert little breast that seems so soft, yet hard and so full. I slide two fingers into my now sopping wet folds and then pull back out. I run my other hand down over my breasts and then down to cup my ass. Your eyes flick down to mine as I start to squeeze my cheeks. You can hardly breathe. You can't think. Not yet. I can't take it much longer. Your cock starts to get hard. You try to sit up a bit to free it but it just keeps coming out of its shell. Finally, I put one last finger into my wetness. You can't move at all. The desire is strong. You've almost had enough.</p> <p>I crawl on the end of the bed to you and straddle your lap so that your hardness is in my grasp. I turn around, kneeling on all fours before you. I let my body slide up the bed, feeling your gaze on me.</p> <p>"I love you!" I say as I move my hands back to each of my breasts, running my palms over my nipples through my negligee.</p> <p>"I love you, too," you answer with a smile.</p> <p>My fingers run along the edge of my pink nipple before running over it and squeezing gently. I can smell our cologne, the smell of our cologne. I let my fingers dance through my hair and I feel my pussy beginning to respond. Your warm hands glide over my body, across my shoulders and eventually you slide a finger down my back and back along my spine into the thin strip of hair that grows above me. I arch upwards slightly in order to slide your finger further down.</p> <p>"Oh, baby," you say, your voice catching and making me feel a little dizzy. "Let me feel those lips," you say. "Touch me..."</p> <p>I smile and slide my hands down my stomach until they reach the top of my panties. You pull down the fabric and I feel my most vulnerable flesh. Your fingers find little places on me that make me want to scream. I'm so hot, so wet. I spread my legs apart to give you better access. You run a fingertip along the lips of my pussy but not into my hole, only up to my clit. Your fingertip is hot, so cold. You can see little drops of my juices. You bring your index finger up to the top of my pussy and run it in a line from my hole, across my clit and up through my pussy lips making me squirm and thrust my hips up in reaction to it. I can feel your fingers, your lips and your fingers, touching me, making me crazy even more. You hold my hips and bring them together and begin to slide your finger back and forth. My juices drip down onto your hand. The sensation makes me shiver and moan, wanting more of it.</p> <p>"I'm going to fuck you," you say. "Just lay back and enjoyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
