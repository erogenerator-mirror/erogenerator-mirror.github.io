Because I have always wanted your cock in my ass."</p> <p>"I'm glad you are finally ready." With that I took her by the hand and walked to the bedroom where I pulled her panties off and tossed them on the bed. Then I pulled off my own panties and tossed them too by her on the bed. She looked at me and I just nodded but still smiled as she slowly moved between my legs. She lowered herself onto me and she kissed me slowly as she felt my ass cheeks on both sides of her. When she had kissed me so softly I pulled her onto me completely, making it seem as though I was going to be the one to do this. So I kissed her back and she continued moving up and down a little at a time.</p> <p>I was so enjoying the feel of her body all over mine. I was in a completely new world to be aware of. The sensation of my own skin on hers was like sliding on wet silk. I had wanted this for a while, and right now I had decided I would enjoy every second of it.</p> <p>I moved myself up to kiss her again as she lowered herself down slowly at times and she moved back and forth slowly to show me how much she cared for me, and also to teach me how to love her in other ways, not just simply because I was now hers.</p> <p>She took one of her hands and her ring finger started to move across my lips while the second started to travel down the center of my stomach towards her pussy. Then she started to rub her finger all over her clit making my lips tremble with desire.</p> <p>"You're so wet my love!"</p> <p>I moaned slightly as she took her mouth and sucked on each of my toes.</p> <p>"You taste so good!"</p> <p>I moved my legs and took her in my mouth. My hips thrust against her mouth a little but she pulled her finger away again making me shake again, much more strongly. Then just as I felt I wasn't getting quite as far as I wanted I took her hand and placed it on my cl-ring and moved it side to side so I could show her how to press the ring. Then I moved my hips to the side so I could still move between them. She made a small sound as I moved back and forth in front of her; a little moan escaping my lips.</p> <p>She continued rubbing the ring on my cl-ring, moving her finger into the ring and back out again. Then she got it over my cl-ring and pressed it back into me; but it was moving outwards faster now. She kept going at one end then the other end; slowly pulling it out and returning it back. I closed my eyes and let my head fall back and savors the sensation. As one hand had rubbed her cl-ring back and forth now I pressed it between my lips while she was pressing my cl-ring.</p> <p>We stopped as soon as I felt my climax building; as if my body had a mind of its own. I held onto the headboard while I felt my spasms start to speed up again. I never came this way before in my whole life; I never knew I could feel this way. I finally pushed my body off of hers and lay there beside her, my legs open and outstretched. I could move but I had to keep my feet on the floor. I finally relaxed and let my legs do all the talking.</p> <p>We both just lay there quietly catching our breath, listening to the waves. As we came back down to earth, I saw she was looking at me with those big brown eyes.</p> <p>"I have never done this with anyone. Not even anyone else."</p> <p>I couldn't tell how to reply so I just looked at her and smiled.</p> <p>"You were absolutely beautiful! I love watching you."</p> <p>"You are really sweet."</p> <p>"Now, we are going to get a chance to see if you still need the same kind of care he takes!"</p> <p>She got out of bed and sat next to me, she looked almost amused, but I couldn't figure out how much she meant.</p> <p>I watched her hands as she carefully walked across the bed and then knelt down and pulled me down beside her. I felt her soft hair brushing my shoulder. I started to relax and felt her hands run the whole length of my legs, up and down the insides of my knees and back again. Her fingers began to stroke my thighs, moving towards my sex. I spread my legs slightly as she approached my pussy. When her fingertips touched the opening of my pussy, I felt my thighs lift, allowing her access. Then she would slide her fingers slowly around my lips, opening them.</p> <p>She pushed her finger, wet with my juices inside me. I felt the wetness as it slid in and out. She started to stroke it in and out; I closed myâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
