Yes, he'd been a little bit rough with our relationship. It had just taken a little time. I had a feeling the pain was going to fade. But right now, that feeling came back. It was not the pain. It was the thought of all that time, and how it was going to be. How he had treated me the way he did. He'd had a tough time with his job, and even though he was good but not what I'd wanted, he had pushed me away. It had hurt him. It was not something I was ready to admit to myself, and frankly, I wasn't ready to admit to myself how deeply hurt I'd been. Maybe, just maybe, the best thing for both our ends would have been for me to confess to his wife, and it would have been the second worst experience of our lives.</p> <p>I took a deep breath. Yes, I'd talked her into being his wife, and I'd done that. I'd had that experience. I wasn't even sure my wife was even capable of doing that for me, but I'd seen in her. He had wanted her to be an independent woman, and I had known that. I just didn't know the how of that.</p> <p>"I can't say why, but I just can't do that for myself. Can I, Mr. Williams?"</p> <p>"I think we could talk about me and this situation while we had the chance," I said. "But we mustn't be in each other's home."</p> <p>He smiled. "Perhaps we should try to get this over with."</p> <p>Of all of the things I had to confess to him, this was one of the things my biggest fear had been that he would find another woman to marry. That he would find another man who loved me for who I was. I was afraid what that might mean for my marriage. I knew what it meant.</p> <p>"I know, George. We can try."</p> <p>He moved closer to me and I turned away.</p> <p>"No, George, please. I'm not ready. I just need to try."</p> <p>For the rest of that day, things continued to be as they had always been. I learned about his life, and about his love for me. My anger, my hatred, my fear, were mixed with sadness. As we moved in our relationship, I was always able to help him get over this. We had a relationship that was very different than what I'd expected. What I had thought was a marriage based on love and commitment was really just another life experience that had happened when I was younger. It was never as intense, maybe for a few months, but there was definitely a connection there. And to be honest, I couldn't get over it.</p> <p>George had always been very nice. I'd never had the thought of him being a lover, but I'd always felt a deep, loving attraction to him as we dated, and sometimes when our schedules met, we'd take time at dinner together. George loved to dance and we'd talk about anything and everything. His sexual fantasies, he'd said, were very intense. There was an intense connection between we, and the thought that I knew how he felt about me, was enough to make his world spin.</p> <p>It was almost too easy to doubt whether we ever would be able to get over being together. I knew that it was a problem, and I knew I couldn't just be left like this. I still didn't know how to handle the idea that I was not sure how I felt about him. All I knew was that I was very much in love with him, and in a very hurtful way. He had given me another reason to be my friend. I just needed to clear up some of these thoughts. When I talked to him again at that weekend, I felt totally alone. Even though the fact that we had never had a relationship again, I was not totally alone, but I couldn't help letting go to let go again.</p> <p>My first thoughts when I got back to the hotel room, was of course the sadness that was hanging in the air. It wasn't just the last night. It was also the day after. And even though I was relieved to see George's loving, but not in a sense of love, I also felt that it was not an easy thing to do. I don't think I would have agreed to that without thinking, even when I knew we could manage it.</p> <p>Over the next few days, when George was back to work, I tried to take some comfort in his love. I think I understood why it was important for us to live together for a while. If he had found anyone new that he was falling in love with, I'd have thought they were the kind of people who would fall in love, but George had only been with me once.
