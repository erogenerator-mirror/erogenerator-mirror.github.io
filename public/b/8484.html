I heard her ask.</p> <p>"Yes, and you..." I said, as her hand reached down between us. She grasped the tip of my dick and tugged on the soft flesh of my shaft, then I felt her moist lips slide over the sensitive head of my dick, the slippery, slippery flesh sliding over the head of the cock I had just fucked. Her wet, soft lips slipped around my cock, and all I could do was groan at the wonderful erotic sensation.</p> <p>"You're still hard!" she said as her lips slid over and around my hard shaft, her tongue licking the shaft of my erect penis. And when her lips slid off and I felt her fingers slide up and down my hard shaft, my hips lifted up off the bed as she touched me.</p> <p>"You're...it feels so...good!" I groaned. "Oh...oh, god!" I cried out.</p> <p>"You feel so good!" she said. "I can't wait another minute!"</p> <p>With that, she slowly pulled me up to my feet, and after getting onto her knees, she pulled my cock down until my head popped right through her wet folds. I groaned as I felt the slick skin of her lips slide over the head of my cock, as her slippery pussy slowly slid the length of my cock, as her warm, wet pussy gripped the base of my hard penis. Her legs slid up and down my body, as if they would hold me tight to her.</p> <p>"Oh, you feel so...good!" she groaned, her hips pushing on my dick. "You feel so good, Michael." She said. Not saying a word, not a word. I watched her lips sliding along the length of my cock, her fingers spreading her wet lips as she held my stiff cock, my dick. My balls were heavy with my sperm that still leaked from her pussy, her moist pussy lips sliding over my cock as she leaned back on the bed.</p> <p>"Yeah," Michael said, pulling my mouth to his. "Suck me. Suck me hard!" His mouth engulfed my lips, and I felt his hand move up my shaft. His thumb, as she was sucking my erection, caressed my cock. He slid his thumb over my helmet, over the tip of my cock, and his hand rubbed my shaft as he worked my dick. His hand slid up and down the length of my cock, moving up over the head when it was covered in his saliva. His thumb slid along the ridge of my mushroom head. I felt my hips lifting up, my hard cock rubbing against his palm.</p> <p>"I want to feel this," he said, his mouth sliding right down my shaft.</p> <p>"Oh...oh, yeah," I groaned as his lips slid around the head.</p> <p>"Are you still hard?"</p> <p>As far as I could understand, I was still hard. "Not really," I groaned, watching his lips slide lower down my shaft until they wrapped around the shaft of my dick.</p> <p>"Oh!" he exclaimed as his lips slid up and down my erection again, his tongue licking the head of my cock as he moved up and down my stiff cock. His lips slid up and down on the head of my cock as his head bobbed up and down on my shaft. His hand held my shaft, my hard cock resting on his fist, and each time I lifted up from the bed, he slid him thumb over my slit. His lips slid up and lowered on my cock, sucking just the head of my cock, his tongue licking the underside of my shaft. His hand was stroking my dick, sliding my cock up and down his hand. He was stroking me hard now. My cock was about to explode.</p> <p>"God!" I groaned as I watched the lips glide back down to my hips.</p> <p>As my hips lifted, my cock slid past his tongue and down his throat.</p> <p>I heard her sucking me in front of both our eyes, as her head bobbed up and down against my hard erection. Then, her head left the bed as she stood up, taking my hands, she turned me back around, pulling me up from the bed. She sat me on the edge of the bed, as she got to her knees. She pushed my legs apart, and I felt her soft body slide under my legs. I reached down to let my legs go, then felt her hands slide up my legs, spreading them apart. She lifted my feet up onto the mattress, my hands reaching out to feel her pussy.</p> <p>Her tits were soft as she lowered my feet back down my legs, her pussy just inches from my waiting face.</p> <p>"Lick me," she said.</p> <p>I heard her say, her words sounding so sensual, yet there was nothing like the feeling of a woman's hot pussy lips being drawnâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
