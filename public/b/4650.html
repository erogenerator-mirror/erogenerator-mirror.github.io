"You need to go and talk to the nurse, to get her to make up her mind for us. I'm sure she can understand the predicament we're in."</p> <p>"What do you mean, and what will she do?"</p> <p>"I doubt it. I'm sure we'll get into a fight and all that, but there can be no harm done. You're the nurse. There can't be."</p> <p>"But, I'm no longer the baby-saviour."</p> <p>"Not at all. I'm sorry about what you've done to me. What more did you want? What would you have to say to the other children?"</p> <p>The tears stopped. It took him a couple of seconds to realise what he had done.</p> <p>"You don't believe me. I didn't mean --"</p> <p>"Now don't lie. We've got some more to be worried about. I won't ask for more, but you need to be honest with me, won't you?</p> <p>"Of course I will," he told her, and then sat her down in front of the phone. "I love you, but I don't want to hurt you."</p> <p>"I know, but I don't know how much I love you anymore," she said, and she wrapped her arms around him.</p> <p>"I know, and I'm not sure if I can forgive you, but don't get your hopes up. You still have a kid -- even if you don't like the one you're giving up, I'll go and take care of that. You're so beautiful it would be stupid not to have had that. I won't force myself, but you have to trust me."</p> <p>She turned her face away from him and smiled at him. Their embrace broke and she said, "I'm sorry."</p> <p>"You're so brave and so sweet and sweet, my beautiful, smart, intelligent, thoughtful, sensitive, sexy lover, that's not true," he said.</p> <p>Her smile vanished. She began shaking so much that he put his arm round her. She grabbed hold of a pillow and buried her head in his shoulder. When he started again, she had an almost maniacal expression on her face.</p> <p>The next day, they were both sitting on their own loungers outside a café when the receptionist told them that they would have to wait a minute or so and she would be over. She left the café with them and walked through a group of people to the door, and she turned back and said, "Don't try and change my mind. You'll find that we've got to talk more seriously first, because what I'm talking about is not your doing. I had to go to the hospital and I'll be back."</p> <p>"I could say that. I'm afraid the other patients are going to come in my way."</p> <p>"But what about me?"</p> <p>"Let's go, and we'll go to the nearest hospital and discuss what there is to talk about. You've got to see what the patient is about first."</p> <p>By the time Trudi had gone down the long corridor from the hospital, he was beginning to feel as frustrated and confused about her as she was. She felt a little better at seeing him upset. That night they fucked in the car and, when he was in the toilet, she used a condom on him, and she was surprised that it did not hurt. Instead, it gave him more confidence and made more sense. It had already taken an hour to complete the process of being a partner with her lover and the next month when they would spend a few days apart. His frustration level had subsided.</p> <p>He knew that she would like him. Not just as a sex partner, but also as a lover. That way he would find other people as well. So what would happen between the two of them next time they met? There was no question of going to the same clinic she had used, but it was his chance to make up for his lack of experience.</p> <p>It was another week before he had to attend to work. This time he was not going to the hospital, but going to a local hospital with a local anaesthetic specialist. He was also going on a holiday for five days. They would meet again in a month's time or so and then go back to their hotel. That was another new experience for him, but he knew that he was going to love every second of it.</p> <p>The following week he was feeling particularly stressed. He found that the first couple of weeks they spent together were all about work. And they had all the time in the world. But then he did, and, again, they only spent one session together each time until he was ready to go to Manchester—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
