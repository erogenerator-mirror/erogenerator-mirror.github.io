That's where I can take you. But I would love to have a good show.</p> <p>"I'm not sure that I like to," she said honestly.</p> <p>"Maybe it's more like taking control." He kissed her again, his hand going to her mound again. "Or maybe I like to make your head ache," he said softly.</p> <p>"Mmm, but maybe it's more like a bit more like taking a step back," she said smiling at him. "Why don't you lead me into the bedroom?" she said, leaning back against him after pulling her panties back up. He pushed himself back up on his elbow and stood up on the bed, leading the way.</p> <p>He sat down on the bed, sitting back and watching her. The room was a mess of papers and clothing, and from time to time there'd be a pile of dust on the floor where they'd been standing. She stood in front of him, reaching out to take his arm.</p> <p>"Are you kidding me?" she said. "You're the hottest guy I know!" She gave him a hug and a kiss, then climbed on the bed. "I don't know why, but I want you to keep me out of this."</p> <p>"So I get to take your bed?"</p> <p>"You'd be the first to know. But you've already gotten to enjoy the things that I've got, so I've got to get my mind off of it," she said turning on the bed and laying on her back. She'd given up on having her panties taken off before they even entered the room, and rather than simply toss them aside it had just been pulled down below her hips.</p> <p>He stood up from the bed, taking the sheet from her body and lying down with her on her back. His lips pressed against her as a hand reached under his shirt, cupping her breast. She gave her head a little shake as his lips found their way to her neck. She felt hands roaming lower, and as his lips came back up she felt fingers start to play with the lips of her pussy through her shorts.</p> <p>"My, aren't you one good one," he whispered between kisses. "I've come to learn that when I've got it inside you," he went on, running his finger over her lips.</p> <p>"Yes," she managed to say, holding the finger that he had in her ear, her eyes half closed from excitement.</p> <p>"And you really can say no?" he murmured as he kissed his way down to her breasts and pulled the nipple. He suckled it gently, pulling lightly with his teeth on the tiny flesh before biting them. The groan that came from her encouraged him to kiss all over her stomach before he worked his way up to her mound.</p> <p>"Please," she gasped as his tongue lapped at her clit before teasing it inside his mouth. She leaned her hands down from his shoulders to the hair that she'd been keeping in his eyes, feeling the muscles of his jaw flex the next minute as he drew her clit into his mouth.</p> <p>"You're so pretty, Sarah. It's nice to see that you make that much of a face," he told her.</p> <p>"I really like it when you call me that," she said, looking down at him. She saw his eyes lock onto hers and they came back to rest on the dark hairs under his chin.</p> <p>"Mmm, and you're so sexy when you're excited," he said back.</p> <p>"You like that?" she said, smiling.</p> <p>He nodded. "I think you already know that," he replied.</p> <p>"Really? I'm so glad to hear it," she replied as he shifted his position and came up to kiss her nipple again. He sucked it into his mouth before biting down lightly on it before kissing it.</p> <p>"Is that what that pussy is for?" he asked.</p> <p>She grinned. "That's what I thought it was," she answered.</p> <p>His mouth went back to her other nipple while his hand drifted lower to her pussy. He caressed her in time with his mouth's travels to her stomach, feeling her shiver under his gentle touch. His fingers explored up under her panties, dipping into her pussy while his other hand slowly and gently stroked her clit while he kissed and licked her. She lifted her hips a bit more, hoping for more stimulation. His mouth moved to her neck once more, sucking on the skin to expose the top of her jaw.</p> <p>"No, baby, not yet," she gasped, fighting the urge to move his mouth down.</p> <p>"Not yet?" he asked as he moved hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
