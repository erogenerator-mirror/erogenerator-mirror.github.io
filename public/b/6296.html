They were always my responsibility, not mine and I didn't like to be bothered by that. It usually came in the form of my ex-boyfriend; we both enjoyed a hell of a lot of sex from time to time. The last one had hit me hard, his mouth was too dry to eat and his hand seemed to be all over himself every time I was away from him, so I wasn't very comfortable with him. We had had a few glasses of wine and I had noticed that he was very clean, I would have guessed. I think he would have been a little bit better off if he had spent some money on sex that night, instead of going off with people he couldn't have seen even if he was drunk.</p> <p>He was about my height and slim, wearing a blue button-down shirt that showed off his muscular arms without the shirt at all - and a pair of cargo shorts like mine but with more of an air of care for me. He had also taken the jacket off at the door when we came in.</p> <p>"Hello, gorgeous," he smiled over at me as if I wasn't there, I shivered. "I didn't ask you where you were going."</p> <p>It was all I could do not to cry. It made me look back at him over my cleavage and back up in his eyes.</p> <p>"H-h-h-hi. Hello? I'm so sorry, I mean, I didn't say anything," I told him, trying to smile awkwardly at him the way I probably had when I was nervous, "It's just that, you look beautiful."</p> <p>For a moment I felt like he was looking in my eyes and looking into my soul, just as I had when I had walked out on him at that damn bar the night of his visit. "Well, what are you waiting for, girl? We don't have all day."</p> <p>"Awe, sorry, not quite ready. So, where have you been? I was looking for you..." I paused, wanting to find something to say, anything.</p> <p>"Uh, nowhere, it's kind of late, I'm sorry," he said, a little unsure of himself, "I'm working right now."</p> <p>"Oh, that's okay," I smiled over at him, "you go back to your work."</p> <p>"But I just can't..." he began.</p> <p>"Yeah," I said, "you do that now, ok?" I reached down and placed a hand gently on top of his cock, which was slowly growing under my touch, "You know how I like to get your cock hard and then have some fun?"</p> <p>I could feel his cock start to expand under my hand as my words sunk in, "No, I've got work."</p> <p>His cock jumped as it touched my hand the first time, it was like it was a part of me, it was a part of him. A thick hard length of flesh, like the one that I had seen in the shower. It felt just like the one I had seen on the webcam, so thick I think that it would be difficult to get my hand around it and fit all the way round. I could feel the blood surge to my cock as his eyes widened nervously, I could see that he had the same thought on his face.</p> <p>"Well, here. Go ahead." I smiled at him as I took another step towards where I had been sitting. His cock was still growing under my hand as I wrapped a hand round his penis, making a gentle circle around the head. As I pulled it firmly to my hand, it felt like it might slide off the outside and into my waiting hand, but it was not quite that deep and it felt warm and soft to the touch. It was hard and almost like my pussy had never taken anything before. As I let his swollen member fall away to stand up out of my hand, it was my turn to stare at it and smile. It was still about seven inches long and looked well around two and a half and it was not too huge; it wasn't heavy either, I would just say it was as thick as mine or maybe both. I didn't really pay attention to where I was pointing my finger, as I was really not very happy with any of the ways a cock had gotten, and I was starting to be a bit disappointed that I couldn't take my eyes off it while I was holding itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
