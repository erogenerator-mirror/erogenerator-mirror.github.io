My hair was loose, just coming up to curl behind it as it flowed over my shoulders. I wore a pair of strappy high heels and a long black dress that accentuated my full figure, showing off my long legs and my full breasts. With both my hands, my dress slithered up my body, showing my nakedness again - my breasts standing straight out and my nipples standing up on my breasts. My arms went to my breasts, caressing them as I walked, and my fingers brushed the hair of my pussy.</p> <p>The man at the bar was seated. I leaned over the bar to chat with him, looking over his shoulder as I did so, to see if he had noticed. As I turned back to my husband, his eyes were watching my legs, and I felt my nipples harden as my breath rushed from my mouth.</p> <p>He looked at me and smiled, obviously very pleased with my outfit. Our eyes met briefly for a brief moment. He leaned toward me and kissed my lips, then my cheek.</p> <p>"You look fantastic," he said. "I didn't know you had hair like this!"</p> <p>It was the first time he had called me that, but I felt his hand brush my breasts, and I looked around to make sure no one was looking. He kissed my cheek again, and I responded with a smile.</p> <p>"Thank you," I said. "Thank you for having me here. I'm glad you took me." I grinned at him knowingly.</p> <p>"I was just getting in to checking out," he said. "We're open til eight, right?"</p> <p>"I think that's fine," I replied quietly, but with a slight smile.</p> <p>As we approached the bar, the lights were flashing. I could see the bartender standing near the door looking at us, he was leaning with his arms crossed under his bald head, his hands on his hips. We stood next to each other, and he raised his eyes to look directly at my full, naked breasts, my nipples fully erect, showing the dark line of arousal across my stomach. The bartender glanced at me with a smile, then turned his eyes back to a slightly longer, but clearly pointed glance at my eyes, so I smiled at him.</p> <p>I took a seat on the stool next to him, and he sat across from me. I placed my hand over mine as we talked.</p> <p>"So, you're married?"</p> <p>"Not really," he said. "Just an unplanned weekend. No kids. I just came to check up on you."</p> <p>I studied his face.</p> <p>"My wife and I have been together only a couple of weeks. We started dating last month."</p> <p>He paused. "Oh no," he said softly. "She cheated."</p> <p>I didn't understand his reference to his wife.</p> <p>He took a deep breath. "She wanted a better relationship." His voice took on a serious tone. "She was the one in charge, and I helped her out. That's all."</p> <p>He took another sip of beer. I took the opportunity to do the same.</p> <p>"I'm getting drunk," I said. I took a small sip of beer for courage.</p> <p>I sat quiet for a moment, hoping he didn't notice that I'd downed the remainder of my beer. When I began to regain my composure, I looked down at his face again, and his eyes were firmly fixed on the exposed areas of my breasts. I let my hand linger for a while on my thigh, then lifted my left leg and draped my leg over his right leg. I felt his warm, muscular leg next to my nylon-covered thigh as I leaned into him. I felt my nipple harden under my dress.</p> <p>"I'm not kidding," I said.</p> <p>He smiled. "Well, at least I don't think I am."</p> <p>I gave him one last moment of silence; then said, "Have you ever been with a woman?"</p> <p>"No. Why?"</p> <p>"Just had some great sex."</p> <p>My reply surprised him. I continued to sit there, looking down at his legs, where I could feel the skin on his inner leg. I raised my eyes to meet his as I continued. "I find it's fascinating," I said. "Aroused and aroused, as we speak. You're obviously very sexually attracted to me. Are you attracted to me?"</p> <p>"Yes, you are very attractive," he replied.</p> <p>I raised my head up and stared at his face, and continued, "Do you want to, you know, have sex with me?"</p> <p>Asking for the right answer, he simply nodded. I continued. "I don't quite know why you are so interested in someoneâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
