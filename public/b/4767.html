She felt liberated from her fear and her fears to feel normal again. She was still a young girl and she felt she still needed an emotional support network to function in her normal adult role. Jane was a young woman and she couldn't get over the idea of being a woman at all, especially in her mind when she was riding her lover. She really thought about being a woman on a mission and doing something about her own needs. That just made her so hot, it almost seemed a good idea to do it.</p> <p>In the midst of their passionate kiss they couldn't help but share a secret moment. Jane's hand was still on her own hip as she stood behind the man beside her. "Don't feel bad about being a woman now," she whispered.</p> <p>"I don't," Eric chuckled. "That was really exciting. I feel so liberated now."</p> <p>"Is it always this wild around us," Jane asked as she felt him stir. She knew he'd enjoyed being with her too. She hoped that they wouldn't ever be the same, with one another again.</p> <p>"It just seems crazy," Eric mumbled. "I mean, when we had those orgasms, I never realized this would be so fulfilling. I had these thoughts that we couldn't do anything anymore with one another. I guess it's because I haven't been so open about myself in quite some time."</p> <p>"It's not that," Jane added. "We just felt that we needed to explore things with others. Just think about that for a few minutes and enjoy it." She squeezed his dick and smiled to herself as she felt it grow.</p> <p>"I've wanted this to happen forever," Eric whispered.</p> <p>"You've been through a lot, right?" Jane asked as she kissed his forehead.</p> <p>"Pretty much," Eric said as they continued to ride the bus in front of their hotel. "I just hope things will go with the flow with you." They'd arrived at their destination after having lunch. It looked great there. The landscape was beautiful in the afternoon sun, and the birds were singing in the trees. It had been a good day. Just feeling those sensations of Eric's cock inside her, running her fingers through his hair, and that new sensation when she had been naked was exhilarating.</p> <p>"Mmmmm," she moaned softly in his ear as two of those fingers found her swollen clitoris again. "I'm wet again."</p> <p>"You're wet, just as wet as I was," Eric replied as she continued to grind his cock inside her.</p> <p>"We have to get our things," Jane said, kissing him on the lips again as she walked toward their room.</p> <p>"We'll leave it at that," Eric teased as he stood and kissed her again.</p> <p>"You'll love how we'll use them when you're naked next time," Jane promised her smiling brother.</p> <p>"You're so right," Eric assured her. He was the lucky boy she'd been talking about.</p> <p>As they walked into the room, Jane felt a little bit more relaxed by the fact that her mother couldn't see them. She felt much more confident that the rest of the family would not be there to see things go off the rails. She couldn't wait for what she knew was about to happenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
