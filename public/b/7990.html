Fuck me good!" I demanded.</p> <p>He responded, thrusting into me faster; I took the challenge for him. I couldn't get away; it felt so good to meet my lover on the bed. I wrapped my legs around his waist and held onto his ass as he thrust into me again and again.</p> <p>I pulled my hand down and started pinching his nipples again, I could feel his body quiver. My other hand was buried in his hair as I felt the first wave of his orgasm hit. I was moaning too, my moans mixing with his moans.</p> <p>"I'll come inside you," he groaned, pushing into me.</p> <p>I felt his cock spasm inside me, my body convulsed in orgasm.</p> <p>He was breathing hard, holding onto my chest as his body went limp.</p> <p>I smiled at him for a moment and said, "I want a little kiss," as I pulled away from him to give him his kiss.</p> <p>I felt his body soften after a minute and he pulled from me just a little, "Thank you," he panted.</p> <p>At the other end of the bed, my lover laid back down and I rolled on top of him, grinding our bodies together; he was breathing hard too. I kissed his neck, nibbling on his ear and kissed the other ear, feeling his body quiver against me more; his hands ran through my hair, feeling me shiver against him.</p> <p>I could barely believe how good he felt, his body was so hot.</p> <p>I moved down and started licking his chest licking at his nipples, his skin quivered with each stroke I made towards them. He had the perfect body, his skin was so soft, I could feel his hard nipples pressing against my tongue as he ran his hands through my hair. I reached down his body and slid his boxers down his legs, I felt his body shiver. I didn't want to wait, I slid a hand down his side and onto his thigh. I felt his leg twitch with every brush of my fingers.</p> <p>I kissed his collar bone, the smell was overwhelming. His body was so hot, so close to mine. I ran my hand up his side, I stopped at his earlobe, I heard his breathing change as his eyes closed.</p> <p>I pushed his leg and moved down his body. I kissed his stomach and ran my fingers into his hair. I ran my lips over his smooth skin, I could actually see his heart beat. I kissed up his inner thigh, his body shivered against me as I ran my lips over his hard muscle, making his body jump. I moved my mouth down his thigh and pushed my face inside, inhaling his manly smell through my nose. His body twitched, his head fell back and his eyes shut.</p> <p>"Take me," he moaned, opening his eyes to look at me.</p> <p>I was on my knees.</p> <p>I laid back on the bed, propped up my head against the headboard. I pulled my tank top off over my head. I tossed it on the chair and lay there, panting, sweaty. I ran my fingers through my hair. I closed my eyes, feeling his body on top of mine, knowing he was between my legs now. I could feel the heat from his body against my legs.</p> <p>I was panting; my heart was beating rapidly. He moved between my legs. I felt his soft skin against my legs, the scent of coconut made me shiver.</p> <p>"You're beautiful," he murmured as he kissed the side of my neck.</p> <p>His words made me want to scream. I felt so vulnerable and yet so wanted, his touch electrified me. I felt his hands on my hips, he slid his body between my legs and rubbed his hands onto my hot folds, I couldn't help my moans of pleasure.</p> <p>I felt his mouth on my breasts, sucking my nipples and the feeling made me quiver. I couldn't wait any longer. My fingers ran along his back and reached his firm ass.</p> <p>I guided him towards me so he could slide himself inside me.</p> <p>I felt him groan in my ear as he thrust inside me; he ran his hands over my hips, feeling me move up and down; he slid his body against mine.</p> <p>I wrapped my legs around his waist, I was afraid I wouldn't be able to move my body again, it felt so good. I could feel myself tighten on him.</p> <p>"I love you," he breathed into my ear as my arms wrapped around him as if holding him.</p> <p>His head was against my shoulder. I was trembling, my hips pressed up against his as he thrust into me. I couldn't control myself, I wanted it... I knew I couldn't.</p> <p>His voiceâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
