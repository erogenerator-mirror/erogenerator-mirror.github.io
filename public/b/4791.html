You wanted him to come here."</p> <p>"I couldn't get him to see me. He was my best friend."</p> <p>"Then he's better off not seeing you."</p> <p>"Yes, it's true. But I just can't bring myself to be with him again, we really don't have a bond."</p> <p>"No you don't, but if your mother and you ever meet, there will be no getting over it, I promise."</p> <p>"Will I still be friends with you?"</p> <p>"Maybe."</p> <p>"Yes, I certainly will be friends with you," Emily replied as she hugged her daughter tighter. "Well, thank you for letting your son stay with you for your daughter."</p> <p>"I guess I could have forgiven him for acting like that," Emily replied. "There were a lot of things up in Seattle, but my son is a real nice guy."</p> <p>"Yes, he is, but I should have known the reason for his mood was because of my son."</p> <p>"And if I'm to be your son, how much of your son would be his son?" Emily queried.</p> <p>"I really don't know, not much, really. But you should go visit him again, when I am gone for another year."</p> <p>"I don't know, what have I got myself into already. I guess I would have to get up close and personal with him some more, but I guess I'll find out."</p> <p>Emily returned to bed, with a pillow in her lap, and she spooned with her daughter. She laid her head on her shoulder and sighed as she drifted off to sleep. Before she drifted off, she remembered that the previous evening had been so erotic and wonderful. She thought of the time when her father had been her best friend in the city and what had passed before, if any of the other times that had happened with him. What had then been so wrong and wrong, had really changed so much.</p> <p>~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</p> <p>Emily awoke to a ringing telephone that she never thought she would ever have. There was a knock at the door. Looking through the peephole, she saw a white man standing there, looking around the house as if he was having a hard time finding something to do with. Suddenly feeling nervous, she walked toward him, wanting to say something to him, but fearing it might just come to nothing. She had been looking to see if he had some work or something and when she saw him standing beside her house with someone in tow - it was just a question.</p> <p>"So what can I help you with?" Emily asked.</p> <p>They stood in silence for a moment. She could feel a tear rolling down her cheek, while she was looking at the man. She didn't know what to answer. She thought that perhaps the answer would be 'yes, I'm up in the kitchen doing some work'. But the only reason her mouth could talk was because her lower lip was so puffy and when she did look up, however, her eyes were sparkling. She didn't move, but she did look so beautiful that it made Emily want to curl up in a ball and bury her face in her pillow.</p> <p>"Are you okay? Can you fix me up a cup of tea?" Emily asked as she took the tea from his hands.</p> <p>"Yes. I can fix you up a tea cup if you just let me get it fixed."</p> <p>"What happened to you, sir? I guess I should have you help me get a few things fixed before your son comes home?"</p> <p>"I am sorry sir, but I just woke up feeling like an idiot. I couldn't find a place to fix anything. Please let me go and go straight home, sir."</p> <p>"I don't know what I would ask you to do for me, Missy, but I insist it be you."</p> <p>"Please! I don't want to go. I'll just stay here for awhile, I promise."</p> <p>"All right. I'll pay for your tea."</p> <p>"Thank you. I'll be right back, I promise."</p> <p>Emily walked with her son toward the front door and she watched as his eyes light up with excitement. She closed the door behind them and sat down on the side of the old stone porch. She turned to face him, hoping to hug and kiss him goodbye, but she felt that it would not be good to feel hisâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
