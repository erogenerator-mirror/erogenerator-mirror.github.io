I had a good feeling about this dinner because the conversation was mostly about school and the new job. It was all about work! I looked over at her and she was looking at me with the look I had known so long ago. I felt a deep sense of pride, and I decided to try and hide it a bit.</p> <p>After we ate we made our way upstairs. It was dark and the bedroom was quite nice. We went into the master bedroom and there were candles sitting on the night stand. We lit them and turned to face each other. We both leaned and touched each other and leaned back and then leaned forward and we kissed.</p> <p>I pulled back and looked over to her and smiled. I could see her watching me like I was a puppy or a kitten or something. I was looking right at her. I took her hand and brought it over to my face. She leaned closer to me and I put my head on her shoulder and she put her hand underneath my dress and touched it, it was warm and it was soft. She ran her fingers through my hair and it felt warm and silky against her fingers. She leaned back just a bit, my lips were over her breasts and her nipple was hard. I could feel her breath in my ear and I kissed it and sucked it lightly in my mouth as I lightly licked her breast. I knew she could feel my tongue on her nipple and she reached up and ran her hand down between my legs and I heard her sigh as her hand cupped my breast.</p> <p>I looked again into her eyes and I saw the desire there. I had to try it, this couldn't be happening, could it? I moved back a little, I wanted it to. I put my arms up around her and reached my head back and my mouth came to her neck. I took her collar bone between my lips and her moan indicated I was done with that. I opened my mouth and licked and sucked on it. She let out a giggle and slid her hand down to mine and held it tight.</p> <p>"You like that?" I whispered into her ear. "God!" She moaned in my ear. "You like it, don't you!." She breathed in my ear as she pulled my hand down to her crotch.</p> <p>"Yes!" I answered her. "Your hard cock! Oh, yes!" I was stroking her hard little clit under her panties and she was moaning in her throat. "It's all for you!" I whispered to her and let go of her. I started to pull them off and she pushed me back a little. I knew what she wanted and I went back to work on her nipples, as she watched me. I kissed each one individually and then did the same to her nipples.</p> <p>She was enjoying herself as much as I was, so I kept on going, giving each nipple extra attention. I could hear her breathing getting harder and harder, and there was a slight vibration in my ear, so I knew she was enjoying this as much as I was. She grabbed my head again and pulled on it at the same time she pulled me down and we kissed some more. I pulled back a little and she looked at me.</p> <p>"Do you know what you're doing?" she asked, as my hands went down to find her. I pulled her towards me and pushed her back against the bed and our lips met. I took my hands and pushed her onto her back and she reached back and pulled at my face and kissed me hard as our tongues darted together. The kiss was passionate and I was not sure that was going to stop anytime soon, so I pulled back so I could get my shirt off and she pulled my arms over her head and we kissed again.</p> <p>We kept on kissing, and as my hands started to slide down to her legs, I knew it was time for her to tell me what she wanted. "I want to suck your cock!" she said. "God yes!" was my response.</p> <p>"What is your pleasure?" she asked with a sexy smile as she pulled me down to her mouth. "Do you want me to suck your cum?" she asked, pushing her hand down between our legs. "God yes!" I breathed. "I want your cum in my mouth. I want to swallow it."</p> <p>I took in the sight of her perfect breasts and her hard nipple. "I want to taste it." I said. She moaned and I felt her mouth sliding down my body again. I put one hand on the back of her head and she did the same to my cock. She let her tongue go between my balls, I felt her tongue running around each ball. She took each one in her mouth and teased it with her tongue, licking it as sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
