"This will be just as perfect for us."</p> <p>"I hope so, as you are very much looking forward to your 'session,' Miss," he smiled at her.</p> <p>***</p> <p>"Please don't think we'll be here for just anyone," she told him in the dimly-lit space of her bedroom, "as the only woman here now is you."</p> <p>Hearing this, Paul's head was still spinning slightly, and he still couldn't believe he'd just fucked this hot, sexy little college girl from the top of her class and she was going to get it on with him...on the first date. Paul had always fantasized about this, and having gone along with it, he didn't expect that their 'session' would actually have a sexual connection. No, it wouldn't be just fucking, though...he wasn't sure why. She couldn't be that sort of person. He'd never get over having a girl in the other room with him, so he knew his way around a woman. He'd take his time in fucking her though...even if it meant being her first.</p> <p>"Let's just get right to the good time, young man," she told him, leaning across him and kissing him. "You've got plenty of time, I promise," she added playfully. She made her way over to the nightstand and opened the top drawer, pulling out a thick tube of K-Y. She squirted some on his hand and told him to wrap it around his dick. As he did so, she handed him the dildo, which he started to place there.</p> <p>"Oh no," she teased, "you're going to slide that thing up my ass before I do. No, that's too good a time for that. Just get back here," she added with a wink, as she started to push the head of the dildo into his ass. Paul started to move his ass to help her, because he knew this would be the most gentle, slow, sensual pleasure he could give his cock, right at that moment. He could tell she liked having her butt fucked, and he could tell that soon he'd be in love with her.</p> <p>"There's still a little lube left in here, don't worry," she told him as she began to slide it up and down through his anal ring, making sure it was completely coated with the warm, wet gel. "And I already feel pretty good," Paul lied.</p> <p>"As good as I'll ever feel," she grinned, looking over at him through half-closed eyes. "My, aren't you ready to be taken...?" she teased. Paul started to protest a bit, but just then she slipped her hand under his balls and gave them a slight squeeze. His cock twitched to her touch as she did so.</p> <p>"I guess so," he agreed with a moan of pleasure. His head was still spinning a bit, but he was at least getting some relief. He didn't have much experience in this aspect of the male anatomy, so he guessed he would soon get at least some kind of pleasure out of having her ass full of cock...for all they were really doing...</p> <p>"Just relax a bit," she told him, giving his scrotum a squeeze. Paul reached forward and took hold of his own cock, slowly pumping back and forth as he continued to slide up and down in the lube. He couldn't hold back much longer.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum," he told her. "I'm cumming," he warned her as, in a matter of moments, he shot out all over the bed, almost falling on his back. He tried to keep his balance by grabbing on, keeping it from falling to the floor.</p> <p>"Yeah, you're cumming, too. That was incredible," she agreed, running her fingertip over the tip of his cock and taking it out, smiling. "It looks like everyone's cumming, too," she told him as she wiped her hand on the bedspread and spread him out on the clean spot.</p> <p>"We're going to have to get this over with real soon," he told her, as he rolled over to look at her once more. "What time is it?" he asked. "It looks like it could get very late, as we have to get going," she said with a mischievous grin. She pulled her thong panties from the night stand and pulled them up before laying her bra on top of them. She then gave him a sly look, and he couldn't help but see a sparkle in her eyes as she turned around to give him a glimpse of her ass.</p> <p>"It's time to get you in bed," she told him. "Hurry nowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
