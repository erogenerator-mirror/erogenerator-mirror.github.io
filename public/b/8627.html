She kissed his chest and then lowered her head slowly down to his pubic hair. She opened her lips and licked his cock head up and down once each time she drew away and then she slowly lowered her head and took his cock deeply inside her mouth.</p> <p>"Mmmmm," she moaned in his ear. "Your cock tastes so good."</p> <p>She began to suck even though he was in her mouth. She knew from her own experiences that he really wanted her to do more. She sucked the full length of his cock for several long minutes then she pulled away and looked up at him.</p> <p>"Do you want more?" she asked him. "Maybe another blow job?"</p> <p>He just nodded that he did.</p> <p>"Why don't you lie down and I'll give you some relief. I promise you it will be pleasurable for both of us."</p> <p>He lay back on the bed and she climbed on top of him. Her pussy lips parted and her clit started to protrude towards him as she lowered to him. It was hard for her to get down but it was not long before he was all the way inside her. He began to move his cock in and out of her for a while before she raised herself up.</p> <p>"Let's give them a try," she said as she turned around in the tub and sat up. She got back on the bed with her back to him, her long brown hair in his hand, and she put both of her hands on the back of the tub. Her breasts stood straight out and she squeezed them together while she guided his large erection to her opening. She was slightly uncomfortable because he penetrated her a bit at first but soon it was good and she got wet. He slowly worked his cock into her with an easy long stroke. The feeling of being able to move inside her and knowing he was going to come soon was wonderful; the sight of him doing that for her was something to fantasize about.</p> <p>"I need you to fuck me just once more," she said. "This is just the start."</p> <p>"No, I want to do it now," he replied. "I want you."</p> <p>He got off the bed and stood behind her and kissed her while pushing his big cock between her legs. She lifted off of the bed a bit more and then leaned on the ledge facing him. Her pussy was still a bit sore from the earlier pounding and he could not wait any more. He lowered his body to hers and spread her legs. He held his cock in his right hand and aimed it towards her. As he did so he rubbed the head of his cock against her clit as he slowly pulled away. His cock was still only a bit wet with her juices but it was a good omen. He had her bent over the edge with his head under her while slowly inserting his cock into her pussy. She was still quite tight but the sight of his large cock sliding up inside her was a thrill. He began fucking her with long strokes. First it was a short stroke all the way in and then he got into an extra rhythm. She was beginning to groan now and her body was responding with new sensations. He could feel her pussy tightening around his cock and knew he was about to come so he lifted off a bit to get a faster pace and kept on slamming himself into her as hard as he could. She arched her back, pushing against his body and squeezed his cock with her pussy as she climaxed. He could feel the orgasm that was building inside her and he continued to bang her into the mattress as she came.</p> <p>Finally, he was spent and he collapsed on her back. They lay there together in orgasmic bliss for the longest time. They were breathing hard by the time they both came down from the bliss themselves. As they kissed deeply, he said, "Thank you so much."</p> <p>"You weren't as gentle as you thought," she replied with a chuckle. "That was so good."</p> <p>"I didn't know I would be so gentle with someone as gorgeous as you are," he continued. "Your pussy is too damn good to be wrapped around your boyfriend's cock."</p> <p>"That's what I figured," she giggled, turning out to be serious.</p> <p>"Besides, you made it easy to get there for me," he said. "I didn't even feel your tits when I came inside you. I think I should have come inside you."</p> <p>"Not as easy to get off as you thought," she replied with a chuckle. "But you were wonderful."</p> <p>"It's not so bad though," he said as he got off the bed. "It has just been a long time since I have done this."</p> <p>"Maybeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
