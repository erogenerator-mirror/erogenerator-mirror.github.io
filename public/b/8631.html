I would have to play with this for a while to get him to go and talk about it.</p> <p>When I got back to the kitchen, I had a little more to think of. I had gone back to the computer and was just now deciding on how to go about getting my son interested in me.</p> <p>Then a voice in my head said 'Hey Mom! I guess I would love to get laid. I was so lonely."</p> <p>I couldn't believe my ears. I couldn't believe it either. My son was a young man. And I was a married woman. Why was it that I was in a sexual situation with my son? I thought I was finally getting that sexual feeling.</p> <p>Mom went on with our small talk about our son for a while. Then finally she asked me if I had made any friends of my own. Of course I told her I had only seen two or three. That made me blush. "Well son, I'm not kidding when I tell you that I've not had much sexual contact since I got the divorce. I've had lots of boyfriends. My husband never touched me. He never really enjoyed it. If he did, it certainly wasn't anything that I was interested in. I have been more interested in girls my age. I've dated girls my age. My girlfriends said I look good in a swimsuit. I guess you could say it's just that sort of thing. I think they were just trying to get me to wear something new."</p> <p>To my surprise, I really didn't have a lot to say to that. My mind had been on my son and I hadn't noticed him. But he had said something. And he knew. There was nothing that it could have said. So I told him I wanted to get rid of him.</p> <p>He surprised me. "What did you say?"</p> <p>I told him that I hadn't wanted him to leave. "No, I guess I didn't. Don't worry about it. I've gone out and I'm still having fun."</p> <p>After this he said, "If I were you I would go up to your room and take care of myself."</p> <p>I told him again that just wasn't my idea. I just didn't want him to leave. I couldn't even say that it was no trouble at all. He just wanted to give me something to look forward to.</p> <p>So the next day about a week later I was walking from one meeting to the next. I saw my son standing down by a meeting and he was with another couple who was at a different part of the building. My son was taking notes but he seemed to be ignoring me.</p> <p>When I passed the desk I saw that my son had been going to his room for a while. He was gone a whole week. The guy had a different man in the room with him. He left about an hour or so later. As I was walking down the hall to my son's room I could see I wasn't wearing any panties. There was this guy coming into my son's room. As I passed their room I went in and turned on the light and stood near them both. I told myself to take note if they looked in our son's room. I didn't want to seem too desperate or too unprofessional. I just wanted to be sure I wasn't being unfaithful. I wanted to be sure that my son had some sort of hidden agenda involved while I might be just taking care of myself.</p> <p>Then I heard my son say, "Hey honey, that sounds like it's going to be a little fun."</p> <p>I turned around to take my son's side and say, "Look, I'll have what is necessary from here and then you and I can go our own. Just go have fun."</p> <p>"Okay, Mom, I'll go right on ahead." After a couple more minutes of my son's talking and listening, they looked towards me. My son was really looking me up and down. There was a bit of a bulge in his pants under the thin robe I sported a few minutes before. I could feel myself blushing.</p> <p>Then they left without saying a word.</p> <p>On the way home from the office I thought I would talk to my son about this. But he didn't talk to me. I was so confused. Why was he showing some kind of sexual interest in my son's young friend? And why did he seem interested in having sex with me?</p> <p>I finally found my voice and said to my son, "What are you talking about?"</p> <p>"I just wanted to come over and see if you would have dinner with me Thursday evening." He said.</p> <p>"You wanted to see what I planned on having him do with me Friday, didn't you?" I asked.</p> <p>"Come over with me, Momâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
