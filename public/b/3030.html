He looked at me but didn't say anything and just grinned.</p> <p>"Can I see your tits?" His fingers slid to the top button on his shirt and with a quick twist, he had a few buttons undone. He pulled it off of his shoulders. I couldn't help notice some muscles under his skin.</p> <p>"I like them," I replied, trying to act as nonchalant as possible without getting too carried away. "But I like a big one." He grinned and reached out to caress my chest as he sat down on the side of the bed. I took the opportunity to watch as he bent over to pull his shoes off, giving me a clear view of his ass.</p> <p>"Can I take your bra off?" I teased, sitting on the side of the bed and leaning forward to run my hands up and down his chest. It was amazing. He was smooth and muscly, and I thought that being him naked was going to feel great. I let my hands linger for a few moments before taking off the rest of his shirt.</p> <p>"No," he said, sitting up again and pulling off my shirt with his back turned so that everything came to rest on my chest.</p> <p>I sat forward and slipped my tank top off. He gave me a look of appreciation, but I pulled it over my head. I stood there in just my bra and slid my skirt off. He had to turn back to my left again but instead of sitting down, he reached out and gave my chest a tender squeeze before turning to kiss me again. I put my hands on his thigh as he leaned forward, and then rested my hands on his stomach. I could feel his skin through the thin fabric. I ran my hand over his stomach, and he moaned. I moved my right hand into the front of his jeans and grabbed his member by the base and began jacking him off.</p> <p>"Shiiit, yes. "</p> <p>I leaned back and unbuttoned his pants so I could pull them down and off his legs. I was getting so turned on by this, I could feel an orgasm creeping up on me, and I wondered if I wanted to come at the same time. He was wearing a condom.</p> <p>"Do you usually suck my cock first?" he asked.</p> <p>"No." I replied. "I just can't help myself."</p> <p>I pulled my bra off and tossed it onto the bed, and turned the bedside table to get a condom out. I pulled down the top of my panties and pulled it out to give him a glimpse of my red pussy lips as I took my remaining shoe off and took the condom.</p> <p>"Let me lube you up," I said as I handed him the end of the condom. He opened the package, unwrapped the condom and dropped it onto the bed between our legs.</p> <p>"Can I eat you instead?" he asked.</p> <p>"Not if that's what you're afraid to," I said, reaching out and grabbing his cock. I slid onto the bed, positioning myself on my hands and knees.</p> <p>I felt his fingers start to touch my pussy as he pulled the lube from the bag. He used one finger to open my pussy lips, sliding it over and into me before moving a second finger into my ass. I had been afraid he would stop, but after a second, nothing went right. I pushed back onto his fingers without realizing it, and he slid a third finger up my other hole. I started pulling his face into me, pushing the head of his cock back into my mouth. I heard the lube being tossed onto my thigh. His fingers were moving rapidly over my pussy opening, and he was still lubing his fingers. Soon he was inserting two, then three fingers. I didn't know how good it felt, and I couldn't tell where I went from there. I pushed back onto his fingers as they entered deeper inside of me and felt his fourth finger moving faster.</p> <p>I started fucking his fingers with my pussy, pushing into him with every movement and when I felt they were all gone. This was one of our favourite things. I felt completely filled up and stretched out. I had been fucked in the ass, twice, but he always wanted to take me slowly, so we did. I felt him begin to move his fingers to rub my clit, and this made my cunt feel so nice that I reached down with both hands and moved his fingers out of me. He slid his fingers back in, and pulled the vibrator slowly out of my pussy.</p> <p>He flipped my legs over his shoulders and pulled me over to straddle him. My pussy was wet, and I couldn't believe how good it felt. He started to slide the vibrâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
