What can I say, I'm not gay or anything. I love a woman's lips, and I want to lick them and taste every inch of her lips. I just want to taste you!"</p> <p>"Yes, you can start by doing that. But let's get this show on the road before we get down and dirty!"</p> <p>My cock had responded to her words, and she wanted it badly, and my tongue was starting to move as I got a hand under her ass and down between her legs to explore her lips and clit. With her moaning softly, she spread her legs slightly before lowering her hand to the bed to position my hard cock, then she pushed herself toward me for entry.</p> <p>We moved together to join one another, then our mouths found each other once again, our tongues wrestling for dominance. She tasted salty yet wonderful. She moved from my lips to my lips then moved to my neck. As we moved our mouths together, our tongues danced a tango of pleasure.</p> <p>"I'm going to fuck you tonight. Can you just watch?"</p> <p>"Yeah! I'm naked on our bed right now. I'm just waiting."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>My hand came up as her pussy lips were separated in her arousal. She was dripping.</p> <p>"Just look at me, and touch me."</p> <p>My hand went from her pussy to her shoulders, then to her breasts, to her lips and chin. With the hand that was on her hips, she started to slowly move.</p> <p>My hand was over her breasts, caressing them gently.</p> <p>My fingers started to move down her stomach, and I could feel her heat in the cleft between her lips.</p> <p>She spread her legs for me, and opened her legs. My finger trailed down one of her outer labia, before sliding down her slit and gently back up the other side. A small gasp came from her lips as her juices found my mouth. I loved her taste, and I loved the fact that this was the first time I had tasted her.</p> <p>My finger moved to her clit as it hardened from the stimulation, and my tongue went to work on it. She gasped from time to time, and moaned with each touch, as she started to work herself on my finger.</p> <p>"Do you see how hard my nipples are? How wet my pussy is? Just wait, and we'll go slow," she moaned.</p> <p>I moved my finger off her clit, which she began to move against it, as her breathing became heavier. When she felt the pressure build, she moved her mouth to mine and pulled me closer. She kissed me deeply. "If I let you take me, I'll take you to heaven" she said.</p> <p>My cock wanted just a release, but there was a huge pressure building inside.</p> <p>She looked into my eyes, "Let me take you!"</p> <p>It was the same feeling which had started her on my finger at first. I could feel the cum build in my balls.</p> <p>I looked into her face, her eyes still closed. I could see her emotions, but she was looking into me as if she was trying to connect with me.</p> <p>I couldn't hold my load for a moment, and with one last look of lust, my cock went away into her mouth, as the pressure built. It was as if my orgasm had already started to subside, and her pussy was pulsing on my finger. I could feel her swallowing my cum before another spurt came out.</p> <p>She swallowed again and again as another contraction overtook her.</p> <p>"Oh, shit!" she exclaimed, and I felt the pressure building to a level that she had never felt before. She closed her eyes, and then opened them and looked up at me with a dreamy expression on her face. She pulled my hand to her face, and kissed me hard.</p> <p>"I love the way you taste on my lips!" she whispered in my ear. She kissed my lips, my chin, and all the way down to my chest, where she began licking me with relish.</p> <p>I felt my climax building deep within me. Her mouth and hands were playing and touching every inch of my body. She took care of my cock completely, and she took care of every inch of my body.</p> <p>"I want you to take me as far as you can!" she said between kisses. She moved one hand down and stroked my hard on.</p> <p>We lay there for a moment, in the silence of the bed, her mouth still on mine, her hand still stroking me.</p> <p>"Take off the clothespins," she said.
