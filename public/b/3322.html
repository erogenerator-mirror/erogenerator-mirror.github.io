I said "Well, how about it, baby, you don't have to leave me. How about a nice hug and then see if you can convince me to move in with you? We can always call you when we're not sleeping and you can still bring your stuff."</p> <p>She smiled at me and whispered with affection, "You know, that sounds hot," and then said, "Let's go inside to make love."</p> <p>I was a little surprised by her behavior, but decided not to say "no" to this beautiful creature. As we got in the bed, we snuggled and I began caressing her wonderful body again. She told me she loved my cock, and I was delighted by that. I got out of bed and told her to lay still while I got ready. As I got out of bed, I heard her say "Oh, yes. That feels so good," as my cock entered her pussy again. I started pumping her as she reached under her body again which caused me to get a lot more action than was necessary. As we both knew that this was the same time that I had just completed my orgasm, we moved into sixty-nine position and then started lapping at each other again. My cock remained hard and she asked me to turn over.</p> <p>I moved over her so we could go at her with our mouths, but before we could do it, she asked me to make love to her. I said to her, "That sounds just as good as I thought it would." I moved over her on my hands and knees, and then started to lick her pussy like it was a desert flower.</p> <p>After my cock was fully inserted into her vagina, I slowly pulled out and said "I think this is better for now."</p> <p>She told me she wanted me back inside her quickly, and that she needed to try again, and after all, she was still a little tender with the first orgasm of the night. I slid into her and held myself there, while enjoying the feel of her warmth and wetness. We moved our legs apart to get better access to each other.</p> <p>We were kissing deeply as my cock slowly slid in and out of her pussy. It was then that I noticed that her breathing became faster and more shallow. It was about the time I stopped moving, and told her to hold on some and let me go all the way in. As I did, she said, "Not so fast, baby. I have to feel you in me!"</p> <p>I felt her hand on my ass cheeks as her legs wrapped around mine and she pulled me closer. As we were moving against each other in this position, I asked her if she wanted me to come in deeper, and she said she did, and felt my cock begin to stiffen. As I felt the first spurt of my cum, she said, "Oh shit," and started moving faster against me. When she felt my cock swelling, she pushed me all the way back, almost in an out way, and said, "I feel all of the cock in my pussy. Oh, my god. I'm in the sea again! That was magnificent!"</p> <p>I couldn't believe it, but I was hard again. As in, she reached under and felt me, and said "I need to try something different with you now," and rolled over once again. She lifted her body up and looked down at her pussy and its swollen little clit. She took a deep breath and then looked directly at me and said, "I can see the head of your cock coming out of your hole at the same time it does. It feels so different from my pussy. Do you like it?"</p> <p>I was looking directly at her pussy now, and was almost in the sky as she continued to smile at me. She said "I want you to come more often. I really love the feeling of your cock going in and out," which caused her to smile even more.</p> <p>As I felt her body begin to twitch, I said, "Well, maybe next time," and rolled over onto her side to get out of bed. We lay in each others arms for almost thirty minutes, before she said, "I don't want this to end either, so I know I have to go to sleep."</p> <p>"Well, I know that," I said with a smile. "How about we do it in the shower?"</p> <p>She agreed, and I rolled onto my back and watched her begin her shower. About this time, I heard her door shut and turned to see her leaning against the doorway. I thought she had just gone to bed, and was going to call it a night, but she had said she was nakedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
