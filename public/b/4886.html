Do you need to wait a little bit?" He asked with a grin of amusement.</p> <p>"Not at all, baby." She replied with a smile. "I just don't want to make you wait. I've really been needing that for so long this past week and I can't think of any other way to repay you." She said as she gently pulled him back.</p> <p>"There is no problem... I love you, I really do and honestly, I'm glad you did," he replied as he pulled her in for a huge kiss. Her lips were soft and felt like silk as they were pressed against his. She moaned into his lips as he started to gently grind against her through their kiss as he held her close. He gently nibbled on her lower lip and gave it a small tug as he pulled away from it and gave it a few more strokes before continuing to move toward her neck. He leaned heavily against her back until his face was positioned between her breasts and he gently kissed her skin as he stroked her with his hands. This time, he pulled his lips away at a point where he could kiss and nibble on her breast very lightly.</p> <p>"Oh, that feels so good. " she quietly replied as he continued to stroke her soft skin. He moved his hands slowly down to her jeans but instead of taking off them completely, he just started to rub her thighs gently as he continued to fondle her breasts. After a few minutes, he finally removed his hands and he started to gently pinch her nipples as he continued to caress her body and she sighed and moaned. He brought one hand out from under her sweater and slowly reached around to unbutton it. When he had the two sides open, he slowly slid it down her body until it reached her waist.</p> <p>He started to massage her body again as he kissed her neck and reached over to pull down her t-shirt. He slid his hands down further and gently squeezed her breasts with his palms. She was so warm, so soft, her breasts so large, her nipples already standing erect and pushing against his palms. He moved his hands back up from her breasts and slowly reached down to cup her bottom in his hands and slowly lift it as he continued to gently kiss her neck while he rubbed her skin. She let out small shudders when he finally reached her bottom and gently squeezed it and teased her with his tongue. His tongue was now teasing her entire upper and lower part of her body as it gently circled her nipples. It was all she could do to keep from moaning out loud as she tried her hardest to keep her balance while he slowly moved from her breasts down to her waist.</p> <p>"Please, baby" she said as she started to struggle slightly a little.</p> <p>"Not yet," he said, quickly stopping and releasing one side of her thong as he continued to knead her breasts, "I don't want to take this any farther. That feels way too good."</p> <p>"Please, honey. I need you inside me again." She replied with a smile.</p> <p>"Then just take them off and get them wet and sit on the edge of the bed," he said as he gently pushed her towards the bed. She was a little unsure of her next move but she didn't have to ask twice. She took both titty's in her hands and gently guided him back towards her center with her legs bent up on top of his. As he pulled them apart, she could feel the wetness that was already starting to run from his lips and chin down to hers. She leaned forward on him and started to kiss his forehead where he was lightly rubbing her body every so often.</p> <p>"So, you like?" he asked, moving his fingers back up to her breasts and gently started to rub them again as he leaned back on his hands while they continued to kiss. She moved her head closer but tried to wait to feel his lips on her nipples in the cool night air. "You know you want to..." she started again.</p> <p>"I want that too," he replied as she moved a little closer to him and started to slowly rub his cock through his jeans. She had him hard within a few moments and he was almost ready to go but didn't want to rush it.</p> <p>"Oh..." she let out as he turned her around and placed his hands on her hips. She wrapped both arms around his neck and pulled herself closer, rubbing her body against his. He quickly moved his hands up from her hips to her buttocks, spreading her legs further as he guided his erection inside of her. They both gasped as it took just a few strokes of his cock up in between her lips to rub her clit, before he grabbed her hips and started to slowly move his hips in and out.</p> <p>"Oh, God," she let out softly as he pulledâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
