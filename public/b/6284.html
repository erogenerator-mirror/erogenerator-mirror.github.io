That's something that you do right. I'm going to get dinner on the table and I'll join you in a couple of minutes. That was so nice to see."</p> <p>She went upstairs, changed, and found a suitably large chair to sit on. "Wow, just incredible!"</p> <p>"Yeah, I was impressed."</p> <p>"How long is he here? You're not going to be in the bath are you?" He looked around. "I'm all alone."</p> <p>"No, it's more than that. My partner is off now and it'll be a week until we have dinner."</p> <p>"Oh, um, I thought you had plans for dinner?" she asked her husband.</p> <p>"The next day. I have to pick her up this afternoon. But I'll be back tomorrow."</p> <p>"You have plans?" she asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, something like this. You and Gary are the 'sensible' neighbors."</p> <p>"What makes you think that?"</p> <p>"I just think that we like you, a lot. And we can have your children someday."</p> <p>"Oh, really?" she asked. "What if I'd given up on him for sex with me?"</p> <p>"What?" he asked. But it looked like she was really hoping that he would.</p> <p>"Oh no, I'm serious. I think that you would enjoy a lot with me. Your friends are pretty excited too. You won't embarrass me, will you?"</p> <p>"No, you won't embarrass me. I'll be here for your comfort and pleasure and I will enjoy having a strong husband with some of the greatest men in the world."</p> <p>"You don't have to wear that to dinner."</p> <p>"I'm not wearing that," she said. "It's a nice suit, and I thought it would suit you."</p> <p>They ate supper and she noticed that the wine was taking its toll.</p> <p>"I hate to do this, but you seem a little out of sorts," said Gary. "Do you like to go to the movies?"</p> <p>"Oh, sure! I love to see the shows they've got done here. They have a big variety of them. They have the most sophisticated, sexy women in the world."</p> <p>"Sounds nice. I'm interested but I don't want to talk about it right now."</p> <p>"No way! I'm going to go see if there's another place we can go."</p> <p>After they finished the wine, Gary turned to Jill and said, "Well, here we go again. I guess it's time that I got out of prison and put on my shoes?"</p> <p>"You can come with me," she said. "There's more wine that there was that night."</p> <p>"I'd be happy to take you with me, just to show your appreciation," he said, his hand sliding down her back to her buttock.</p> <p>"No, I'll stay with you," she said.</p> <p>"We'll see."</p> <p>He followed her to the guest room and then left without looking at her.</p> <p>Gary sat down on the bed to watch a movie and heard Jill return from the bathroom. She came down and sat beside him and they both watched the movie. They continued to talk about the last day with the lawyer until Gary couldn't stand it any more. He turned her on her back and began to kiss her. She allowed him to take his time with her but then she reached down and pulled him on top of her. She felt his arousal and began to stroke him.</p> <p>Gary kissed and licked his way across her neck and down to her breasts. She felt him rubbing his cock against her. She felt her desire rise and begin to build for him. She slid down his body and then began to suck his cock while stroking him with her mouth.</p> <p>Gary's cock began to throb and he began to moan. Jill began to lick the head while working him with her hand. Gary began to thrust his hips up trying to force Jill into him. He couldn't hold himself back. With one last thrust he pushed her away and began to shoot his load all over Jill's face. He continued to moan until he caught his breath, exhausted, and he collapsed on the bed beside her.</p> <p>Jill turned on her side to face him. She kissed him, licked his face, and kissed him again. He returned the kiss and began again to return her attentions until he felt his erection rising again.
