She'd left her panties on the seat in front. And, of course, in the front seat, I'd fingered and masturbated her to orgasm. I'm not sure I even came. She had been in front of the mirror, fingering her cunt while pretending to be me. I don't recall exactly what she'd said to me but I can assure you that it was one hell of a blowjob.</p> <p>My cumming turned out to be pretty bad. She hadn't moved or moaned at all. "Mmmpphh," I heard in the car. "Mmmpphh.." Her breathing was erratic all over again. "Mmmpph" was a sound.</p> <p>She just laid there like that for a minute or two longer. Then she said, "What the hell?" Her voice was weak and trembling. And she said it like it was obvious.</p> <p>"What the hell happened?"</p> <p>This time she said, "You're still there, Joe."</p> <p>I'd just sat there with her listening to her take another big breath, relax, and be. The smell of her on me must have reached all the way up to the ceiling. I guess I still hadn't come.</p> <p>"Honey..." She kept talking for about five seconds. "If you're still here at the hotel, and you still want me to be the only one, I'd be more than happy to be your girl. You can make me all of the arrangements, or you can go home and masturbate. Just remember to tell the other one you're coming." She said that as a joke but I could see that she was serious.</p> <p>I sat there for a minute, looking down at my cock like an animal. Then I got up. She'd still been sleeping, but I took my cell phone out and started the cell phone conversation for both of us.</p> <p>My wife was sleeping peacefully in the back seat, when I had gotten into the car to drive home.</p> <p>"Where are we going tomorrow, Joe?"</p> <p>"Right here," I said and kissed her shoulder. "The same hotel you took me to, the same one where you fucked Joe."</p> <p>She started to laugh but she said nothing.</p> <p>We drove the few miles to the hotel a little ways before she opened the car door and got out. I followed her to the door. There was a sign for room service at the front desk. I went in and got a bottle of champagne, a bucket of warm water, a glass of ice cream, and a bottle of wine, two of which I had drunk the night before. I went to the front desk.</p> <p>"Joe is there for you," the receptionist said. Joe was already walking out of the room looking a bit tipsy.</p> <p>I gave the receptionist a nod and she opened the door for me.</p> <p>"Thank you," I said. "We will be coming down in a cab."</p> <p>"Yes, please bring the driver up to you when you get back," the receptionist told me. "Don't you worry. It will be your pleasure." But there was something about that look that made me think she was getting back the cab and the taxi to leave.</p> <p>The room was in the end of the first floor. It was large and spacious with a beautiful fireplace in it, a huge bed, and a table, chair, and all kinds of other furniture that I didn't even recognize. There was an old TV set, a full length mirror in the room, a set of toiletries, and a sink with glass doors and a small refrigerator.</p> <p>"Sit down and get comfortable," the receptionist told me. "We'll come and get you." I sat down and she handed me the champagne. "Thank you, Joe."</p> <p>"Anytime, honey," I said. She smiled at me and gave me a kiss on the cheek and left.</p> <p>I turned on the news while I was out. The big news would be that I was going to have to spend a lot of time in Europe. What was I going to do? I had a lot to think about. I took a shower, dressed and went back to the hotel. It took me less than ten minutes to find the Hotel in the middle of the valley that I had rented that first night we had been together. I had to give her everything that I had but I had to get her to come. That was it. The next part of the plan.</p> <p>I walked down to the back of the hotel and took another look around. There were three bar stools with very comfortable looking chairs on each one, and a large circular table against one wall. I walked past a woman in a black dress in the back of the room where I'd just been, and then stopped and lookedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
