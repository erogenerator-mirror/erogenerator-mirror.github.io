I asked, reaching out to cup her naked, sticky breasts with my palm. She shuddered and whimpered in my grasp, giving a muffled mewl of ecstasy as I rolled her stiff nipples between my fingers. The sweet taste of her sweat tickled my taste buds as she writhed atop the bed in her ecstasy, and I kissed my way down her body to suck upon the sweetest nipple that I could think of. She cooed with a sweet sound of pleasure each time my nose rubbed at her navel, and I could tell that she still adored sex, as evidenced by her constant moaning that was growing louder with her arousal, and the way her thighs twitched as her arousal increased with my tongue and lips.</p> <p>I moved my mouth upon her, taking her nipples between my lips and pulling them with such force that she cried out against my sucking lips, then grabbed a hold of my hair and pulled my face hard against her, pressing her breasts firmly against my lips in answer. I could feel her inner muscles contract around my face as she orgasmed, and her juices mixed with my own saliva before flooding into my mouth as she gushed out her hot and delicious cumm across my tongue.</p> <p>She slumped against the bed, shuddering as she shook at my mouth for a moment before settling back to rest. "No condom?" she said between gasps of breath.</p> <p>I nodded, sitting back on my knees. "On my back next," I added.</p> <p>"I suppose it's not necessary?" she said.</p> <p>"Probably. But I need to say something."</p> <p>"Of course." She reached down, cupping my chin to get my attention as she looked at the wall. "I've already called the number of the limousine."</p> <p>I sighed. "If you'd rather wait, I'm ready to go."</p> <p>She looked off to the side. "There's always room and more to come." Her fingers twined together around her wedding ring, which seemed to be about the size of a thumb, and she gave a little wriggle, then stood. I got up from the bed. "Wait a minute." I turned to the closet, a corner where I had just placed my coat hanger, then went on to the desk next to the bed. When I returned to the suite, she was seated on my floor, gazing at a computer monitor and the TV at an angle that gave us enough time to chat. I set the timer for fifteen minutes, and went on to her desk. "What's the occasion?" I asked.</p> <p>"I just had an idea," she said with a hint of a smile. "I'm going to go and get something to eat..."</p> <p>"Ahh," I replied with a smile. You'd think she would've been eating a meal from a chicken coop in the first place, you idiot.</p> <p>"No, this is my idea," she said, waving me towards the bedroom door. "And so I think you're going to like it."</p> <p>I didn't get much closer to the door at that moment, which didn't prevent me from watching as she went from desk to door before closing it. Eventually I made my way to the door to find her sitting on the bed, arms folded across her chest in the classic fashion that showed she was a lady of color.</p> <p>"I'm sure that you have a nice steak to go with that wine," I said, approaching her.</p> <p>"That's because it smells so good," she said, and I could have sworn that she blushed, then sat down on the bed and put her head in my lap. I didn't mind because I had just finished telling her the whole story about the hotel.</p> <p>"The restaurant we went to is over the road," she said. "Don't you see it when you park?"</p> <p>"I'd like to sit at that table with you," I replied.</p> <p>"Then I will," she said, and in a matter of breath, she kissed me on the cheek. "And I'm not even thinking about that dessert we had today!"</p> <p>"Okay, come on," I said as I took a step towards her, my hand running up her legs to grasp her thigh. I didn't have to say anything because she reached out and ran her hand along the top of my thigh, moving it higher until I was practically in a state of arousal.</p> <p>"Mmm..." she moaned against my lips, then took my hand and led me, hand by hand, through the door and into the dining room. The dining room was fairly small, and I wondered what she had in mind for each of us after dinner. While eating, I made the mistake of staring down her blouse when I entered the dining room.
