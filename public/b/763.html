Maybe we'll share lunch again." He was standing before me and waved. He was clearly nervous. I smiled. I felt a pang of nostalgia. I smiled back and went to sit down.</p> <p>It dawned on me that all of the kids in the class had been staring at me. The teachers, as well as my teacher, had all been looking at me. I laughed at that and realized the kids were laughing too. I realized it must be a mistake to have a crush on my teacher!</p> <p>"Hi, Mr. Smith," one of the kids called out.</p> <p>"Hello, Mrs. Smith." I shook hands with the teacher and shook hands with all the kids before returning to my seat on the board.</p> <p>"Thanks, Ms. Jones, you too, Mr. Smith." The teacher returned my teacher's hand and my teacher's face flushed red as we talked about the class again.</p> <p>"You're a very special teacher, Miss Jones." She smiled and took my teacher's hand in hers.</p> <p>"Mr. Smith, Mr. Smith," she shook hands with the first teacher again. His eyes scanned me all the way to where I was. He seemed to be searching me for something. I smiled again. He was looking me up and down. Oh no, he was looking at me like that. Oh, oh, yes. He was looking at my bare legs and I wondered if he could imagine what I had on under my short skirt.</p> <p>"Why, Mrs. Smith," he said, with a small smile, not missing it in the slightest. "I'm really pleased to meet you." He seemed to take a deep breath.</p> <p>I smiled. "Thank you for being my student, Mr. Smith." I was feeling very good.</p> <p>"This is what you did the first day after lunch," he continued. "You had to work harder than I thought." He took my hand and looked at my fingers.</p> <p>"Yes, Mr. Smith, it was difficult." He smiled at me.</p> <p>"It's very easy." He took my hand. "Did you go into the class today?"</p> <p>"Yes sir, I did." I giggled slightly.</p> <p>He looked at my teacher. "We need to talk about this. What you say may make a difference, but it's not going to change anything between Mr. and I. In class." The girls in the class, including the teachers, were cheering us on. I was elated. I had felt some attraction of a boy's. I felt a little bit guilty. And the teacher, the man in the class, just smiled and nodded and I got to know my teacher better. I liked him, he was a teacher. He was fun.</p> <p>"Please, Mr. Smith," he nodded his head, his eyes staring me in the face. "I would like nothing more than to, uh, take you aside and talk to you about this," he mumbled.</p> <p>"This is my room," I said. "My classroom's on the other end of the hall." I motioned to the door. "Please give me one minute." I went back to my desk where I laid out for the teacher a pencil I had packed. I didn't want to miss any of the class. I would be there in forty minutes.</p> <p>Fifteen minutes later, he walked into my classroom. "Oh, Ms. Jones." He walked over to take his seat.</p> <p>"Yes, Mr. Smith," I answered.</p> <p>"Mr. Smith, please sit down." He sat down after I had left the classroom. He stared at me while he waited for me to return from class. What was I thinking? I should have been asking him to take me over his knee. I wasn't looking at him in the least. I wasn't looking in his eyes. I was looking at his face. I realized I could not stop myself if I wanted to. I wanted to ask him what I thought about him, I wanted to see what he thought of me.</p> <p>"Excuse me, Mrs. Smith." He stood and moved away.</p> <p>"What did I do, sir?" I was still staring at him as I spoke.</p> <p>"Nothing. Do you want something to drink?" He nodded his head towards the refrigerator. "Anything I could?" He looked at me and grinned.</p> <p>"No, thank you. I'm going to wait here until I hear from your mother. I can leave for school when I'm out of school." He smiled broadly and walked out of the classroom.</p> <p>I waited a few minutes. My mind raced, I thought of one last chance. I could be fired, maybe I could get expelled. I decided I wouldn't push the issue again.
