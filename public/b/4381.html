I knew that they'd hit the ground running. They were on a slippery slope, but they were willing to give it a try. Their heads were screwed up in an 'A'. They didn't know what to expect, and they didn't know if they were doing it right.</p> <p>In another minute, Karen's head rolled over, eyes rolling back into her head. Her face flushed red and her lips parted. She threw her blonde curls behind her shoulders and her eyes rolled back.</p> <p>"Oh God, Chris."</p> <p>I smiled and walked over to her. I cupped her head in my hand.</p> <p>"C'mon."</p> <p>We stood there for a minute and she stared.</p> <p>"'Chris, what's wrong?"</p> <p>"I can't sleep. I'm too nervous."</p> <p>I reached out and pulled a sheet from a chair, covering her face. Her eyes widened as I tucked it under her chin. I turned her so she'd just look me in the face.</p> <p>"What the hell are you trying to do?"</p> <p>I took a deep breath. "The kids are getting better."</p> <p>Her eyes widened again, then she took a deep breath.</p> <p>"There?"</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"The kids know that's what's going to happen."</p> <p>"The kids?" She looked up at me.</p> <p>"Uh-huh." I turned her face toward me again. "The kids."</p> <p>She smiled and stared at me for a minute. She bit her lower lip.</p> <p>"OK, we'll do nothing. But I'm just gonna... think you're pretty. I mean it."</p> <p>I felt the excitement in her again. I turned her back toward me so we were touching. Her eyes were still slitted and she hadn't moved away from me.</p> <p>"What?" I asked, surprised.</p> <p>"Nothing. Just thinking."</p> <p>I smiled as I kissed her forehead. I reached over and ran my fingertips along her lip.</p> <p>"OK. We'll think we're better than different."</p> <p>"Great," she smiled, her eyes still locked on mine. "I can't have you looking at me the wrong way but I can at least kiss. If you want me to just think."</p> <p>I turned her head toward me again to kiss her on the mouth. She pulled back with a gasp. Her voice was breathy now.</p> <p>"Chris, what are you thinking. This is the first time that the kids are doing anything other than having sex... not like I do with you and the others. What I'm thinking is that you should not expect anything different. It's OK though, I don't hate you for what you've done to them."</p> <p>I smiled.</p> <p>"Of course I don't hate you. I mean it's not a big deal."</p> <p>Karen shook her head.</p> <p>"If you feel that way, don't think. You know why I'm doing this. It's part of the reason I have your blessing for you to stay in bed with me. Do you know why I'm doing this?"</p> <p>I smiled, "Oh, don't think, I'm just giving you an incentive. I'm really in love with you and I want to make you happy."</p> <p>"Oh good," she whispered. "I love this and don't even care."</p> <p>I kissed her again and I was a little uncomfortable. I wanted her to be thinking that she had to be in charge. But, well, she still had to think, but I didn't want to ruin it.</p> <p>"Do you really think I should tell you that?" she whispered. "That I just..." she smiled, "I'm not sure what to say."</p> <p>I leaned in and kissed her again.</p> <p>"I want us to be our own special people," I continued. We kissed again. "I want you to feel what it is I feel when you're close to me. And I want us to look at each other when we make love. We can be in love. I can tell you that."</p> <p>I looked at her. I'm not sure why, but I had a sense of where we were heading. Karen's eyes were glued to mine as she said:</p> <p>"Chris, do you want to come right now?"</p> <p>"Yes, yes, I do," I replied. "I want to be there right now, I want us to be happy. Come now," I smiled. "Let's go to bed."</p> <p>Karen nodded. She looked around, and she was holding the sheets in two fingers. She looked like she was ready to jump out of bed and run around the houseâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
