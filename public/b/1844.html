I was glad that she was awake, I really had a long way to go before cumming. She sucked on my cock a bit more, not too much, maybe enough to keep me from shooting, but it wasn't enough. I pulled on her nightgown and crawled naked down the bed and knelt on the side of her. I held the base of the condom I had in my left hand and slipped it up into her mouth, leaving it there. I held the base of the condom and slid my hand up to my thumb and forefinger and squeezed it until I was sure I had it firmly in place. I slid down and positioned my cock at her vaginal opening. I leaned over and we kissed for a while. I pulled the small condom off of her and put it on the nightstand.</p> <p>I placed my feet on either side of her bed and slid down on top of her, still kissing her. We broke off the kiss and stared at each other for a moment. I put a hand on her left breast, and I squeezed it as I leaned in and tasted her erect nipple. She leaned towards me so we could kiss, and my body was on top of hers as I lifted up and down, fucking her on top of the bed. She responded, moving her feet to my body and pulling me down as I kissed her.</p> <p>She was moaning and squirming as I kept going. I continued to ride her, grinding and thrusting, until she arched her back and she went off, I continued on down, and we both came again, this time both of us moaning at the sudden pleasure we received, and I pushed her up so that I could kiss her on top of the headboard.</p> <p>She reached under herself to hold me, and I slid inside her, both of us moaning and gasping as the feeling of her tight vagina on me pushed my orgasm past my defenses and my sperm shot into her again. "Holy fuck!" I said as we climaxed together and it felt incredible.</p> <p>We lay for a moment, with me on top of her, and it was my turn to speak. "We did it again?" I still had a few minutes to myself so I said, "Yes."</p> <p>"How did it feel?"</p> <p>"Wonderful. It felt wonderful and I can't describe what we did next."</p> <p>"It was wonderful to be with you."</p> <p>"And what do we do now?"</p> <p>"Same with you."</p> <p>"What exactly are you thinking about?"</p> <p>"If you are anything like me, there should be nothing more you can do!"</p> <p>"Yes, I can't think of anything you could possibly be more in love with than I am with you."</p> <p>She moved her right hand to her right boob and squeezed it. "You're just so wonderful."</p> <p>I kissed her on the lips with more than a little tongue, and she got up on her side and put her hand on my right tit and squeezed and rubbed while I played with her nipple. I pulled on it gently, squeezing and pulling at it until it was rock hard. It was my turn to groan my desire for her, and I pulled my hand from her tit and slid down her body.</p> <p>She grabbed her right forearm and held it away from her body as I began kissing and sucking her nipple. She started moaning softly, and I had a flash of a thought and started licking her nipple, so I did the same thing to her other one. I slid my right hand down and I felt her pussy with my fingers just above it. I slowly worked one finger inside her while I licked her and continued moving my finger in and out and working her nipple more with the motion of my tongue.</p> <p>She rolled her hips towards me, and I felt her hand move down between us and felt her warm lips on mine. I put my arm around her and pulled her down to me, and we kissed for a while, enjoying the feeling of her wetness on my hand in combination with the feeling of her nipple in my mouth. I kissed down along her neck to the top of her breast then back up again. She pushed me down off her body so she could hold onto me. She was naked and beautiful, and I didn't mind. I still had a very wet patch from our play on our bed.</p> <p>She had me lie on my back. She worked me for a while, just kissing me and rubbing my whole body as she moved lower and lower. Her fingertips caressed the skin on my belly, down to my balls and back up again, down to my cock. I had to push my hips upward so she could get her fingers under the base of my cock and stroke against me.</p> <p>I don't know how long she spent teasing me with herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
