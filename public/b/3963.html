The salads served with a selection of baked chicken, vegetables included. Since it was Sunday, with the weekend over, the chicken, vegetables, lemonade and lemonade looked like paradise to make a home cooked meal. While not the most glamorous of restaurant settings, these casual meals were always a special treat. It was on one of these occasions that I thought of another girl, Michelle, whom I had just been with, who had just told me she was getting married to me. I was happy.</p> <p>Before we turned the tables over the next two weeks, Michelle brought a couple of bags along. As she came over to greet them, I could see she was braless, with an extremely fine looking pair of breasts in the thin material of her blouse. When she came back into the dining room, she told me she would be glad to see me, and she hoped she would be with me soon. Of course, I assured Michelle I would wait at home to join her, and that I would see her tomorrow. I didn't have to wait another day to know exactly how I would be going to join her at her wedding and when she saw me waiting, and who was she for?</p> <p>After dinner that night, Michelle invited me to a special "wedding party" with her best friends. The main attraction was the big screen television with over one hundred stations on it, with a good stereo system and lots of speakers. This party was going to be very different than the usual party with friends and family. Michelle didn't want to be there alone so she invited my wife Amy to join. Michelle was excited and told Amy she would be in touch. Amy showed us all around, and we asked questions about "the real-estate" on the property and the company they represented, which was underwriters. Amy seemed happy to start with the part about the company and asked me about myself.</p> <p>Amy did seem to get that the business was fairly close to being in the corporate world. The company was based on an investment in real-estate and property ownership, and it was very competitive. The company seemed to keep the property line up very well, so Amy had no problem explaining things about the real-estate business. I had met Amy before. She was a sophomore at Georgia State. The company was a partner in an insurance company and was making a lot of money very quickly. When we went over a list of things we could get, Amy asked me about Michelle.</p> <p>"She's a really good friend," Amy said. "She and your mom were friends all along. He does it for his own good. He's always had a special relationship with my mom." Amy continued on. "One of the things he used to do was to give me money to buy a house. Michelle told me she has a good thing going with him and likes to keep him busy on his own. I love them, but when you're in the big city that really isn't what Michelle was looking for."</p> <p>"Wow," Amy said. "He's really nice."</p> <p>"Yes, but I'm not that nice," I responded. When Amy spoke about how Michelle and Michelle were looking for a house, I couldn't help but notice that she was always smiling at me. I had to wonder where Michelle and Amy were, since Amy and the others didn't seem to notice us.</p> <p>"So Amy really loves to live on her own. She even bought a couple of real-estate brochures she bought out." Amy continued. "He loves to do it. He's a regular for her. That's the thing."</p> <p>I was thinking about how Amy and Michelle were still friends. I guess Amy was just as protective of Michelle as she always was of Michelle. I knew Amy and Michelle had been in various other relationship for some time. Michelle and Amy had always been close, but as soon as Amy was in college, and Michelle got the job at the company, it started to end. Michelle's job was just hanging out with her friends. I knew it wasn't a personal life for Michelle, but I wanted a long term relationship with Amy.</p> <p>Amy and Michelle made a couple of plans to get to know each other. Michelle was going to be home from her job on Monday, and Michelle would also be busy for the next few weeks working in her real-estate company. Amy and I went over to Michelle's house the following Sunday, and Amy was invited to help Amy. Michelle was happy to help Michelle pick out clothes, and asked if Michelle liked to go shopping together or if Michelle would like me to join her.</p> <p>We finished our shopping together, and Amy and I went home together for a couple hours. We were getting ready to leave when Amy askedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
