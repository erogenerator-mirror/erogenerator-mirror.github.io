It is our way of demonstrating that your own love can take on an entirely new meaning, that it's your life and it won't be forgotten even if it doesn't suit your way of showing it.'</p> <p>"Please forgive me. This may sound like some of the strange questions our new friend has asked me but we are here together for each other's sake and that's not what happened tonight. Please let me prove to you that I'm not interested in the 'meeting' you gave me."</p> <p>I don't know if it was the wine or the heat of the moment I was feeling again my emotions began to take over and I decided to tell him about my day at work. We had been going over a couple's schedules together since early that morning. Each time it seemed we were going to catch the next one in our rush to get on with it. I told him how much I really loved him and our time together would only be better when he found a way to give himself in bed to me. I had no idea how he was going to take the idea so I just kept asking. Finally he relented and asked the obvious question before asking me to take the next ride. When I did I was surprised that he didn't even attempt to get me into bed. At that point I really didn't care if he wanted to make love to my cock. I actually thought it would be a good idea since I had never been so turned on I could hardly believe it.</p> <p>We drove the rest of the way home and by the time he pulled in the driveway my heart was really racing. My cock was so hard it was almost painful. Once again he asked if I wanted to go to bed early. After telling him I really didn't want to even think about trying to make out in the car anymore, I agreed that I had to give in now if I couldn't keep myself from getting myself off, just driving myself into oblivion.</p> <p>As we headed to bed I couldn't help but think of our evening together in the hot tub. Maybe it had only been a matter of a few months since we had met but it seemed like this was even longer. I could see that the sex I had had with him had only helped us understand each other. There was so much more going on than just two lovers who were now as close as we could be. I knew he loved every second of it and told him so I wasn't about to say anything for fear of rejection.</p> <p>I fell asleep almost immediately, snuggled up to him and drifted to sleep, not wanting to think how happy I would make him to be here with me again. There was a slight twinge of guilt as I tried to work out how I was feeling, but then again maybe I had hoped he could understand. I guess the sex thing that had just occurred between us had really gotten to me. I was happy but I was concerned for him. I knew as long as I kept him close I might just forget about all the things about our day together and it might just be a one time thing. I had to tell the man that I thought I had fallen in love with that night. It was still dark outside the bedroom when we got up and stumbled into the living room and sat on couch. I took my shirt off and crawled back into bed in my boxers, hoping he would want to make love to me again so soon. That hope didn't last long. He wasn't going to turn me down and I could tell that he really liked my reaction during that conversation. I pulled back the covers and got a good night's sleep that night and sure enough he didn't waste time, just went right to work.</p> <p>As he began to thrust himself in and out of me, I pulled the night shirt up over my head, trying to keep myself from touching him. By the time he was fucking me with everything he had he was getting quite a bit of pleasure from it and I felt a little guilty because I didn't want him to stop. I didn't want him to be afraid to find someone so he could please himself inside of me. I guess it could be the first time someone had done that and it really hurt me to think of him doing so. Still, all through the day I just felt so good wrapped up in his feelings and his lusts. It was a real turn on feeling his cock inside of me, feeling him inside of me. It was one of the best orgasms I had ever had and I could tell he really felt the same way about my body. As we continued to fuck we began to have a little conversation about how I was feeling as he continued to thrust me in rhythm with him. I finally felt that the only thing his cock could do was to reach deeper and he was able to give me so much pleasure and no problem. Soon both of us were coming and Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
