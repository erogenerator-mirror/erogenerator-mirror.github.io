I felt her mouth moving as her hands moved up my thigh. I could not stop myself. My head went back. Her mouth was sucking on my manhood. My hands were moving on her head. Her head moved faster than I thought possible.</p> <p>The intensity in my eyes was so intense that it scared me.</p> <p>I looked at her. Her lips were still sliding up and down over my cock. I could feel her hands rubbing my thighs in a slow motion. Each time they came to rest a little higher to get a little more contact.</p> <p>At one point she was still moving her lips up and down. I could tell from the sound of it that she had not been stroking me very hard. She stopped for a second. I looked toward the ceiling. It was dark. I turned so that I was on my back and looked down at her. She was still stroking up and down. There was an unmistakable smile on her lips. My eyes were still closed.</p> <p>I opened my eyes. It was now dark outside. The room was not that dark. I felt her come off me and I felt her hands move behind my head. She pulled me back so that we were looking at her. My cock was now semi erect. It did not hang there.</p> <p>I could hear her kissing my dick but her mouth was never touching it again.</p> <p>“Oh baby,” I gasped, “please.”</p> <p>“Can you just come for me baby, it won’t be long now,” she said softly, a dreamy look in her eyes.</p> <p>Her mouth moved up again. With one hand she started stroking my cock, while she kissed my cock and balls with the other. I put my arms down by my sides. I looked into her eyes as her stroking hand made the journey up my cock to my balls. I am not proud about telling you what happens over the next few hours between a woman and a man in bed. I just can not. But now it seemed to be the most appropriate time for my self control and if for no other reason than to keep a clear head.</p> <p>My eyes were closing as the tension in my body was being lifted. I could see her mouth moving over my balls. As my eyes still closed I could feel her hot, wet tongue circling my balls. Her hand kept stroking her boyfriend’s cock. Her hand moved up and down on my cock as her mouth sucked. The pleasure was intense. I was about to come, but I knew I could not let a girl get me that way.</p> <p>Just as the feeling started to start to build I saw the light come on in the bedroom door. It was a man. He had on his suit. A dark green shirt came down well over his muscular arms and went across his chest showing the muscles on his chest. My eyes opened and I looked across the room for my partner. It was my partner. He got up off his feet and came into the darkened room just a couple of feet from us. He pulled up his pants. He turned and walked toward the door. As he took a step I saw what was now unmistakable.</p> <p>The two women in the room were in her and I was sitting up. They were kissing and had their hands on each others bodies and they were rubbing their hands all over each others bodies. The light was coming into the room and we could see all of them. I watched as they came up behind each other and kissed. Hands were moving all over each other.</p> <p>I heard the door open again and then the light come on. It was the one man that had been in the room standing up looking at the window. He turned to me with a sexy smile and said:</p> <p>“Are you still watching the window sir? It’s not a good time for that.”</p> <p>I shook my head. “No I can’t. That is my man fucking her.” My boss was clearly watching.</p> <p>The two men got a laugh at this. They had obviously watched my wife and I being taken out of our room. The two men left. They never said a word. I was speechless. They walked quickly down the hallway, closing the door. My mind seemed to be in a whirlwind as I started to come up. But I could not. I was too busy watching the action.</p> <p>I heard the voice of "the woman" coming from the dark doorway.</p> <p>She asked me if I would like to join them. As I stood up I noticed that I was completely soaked. I didn’t care because she had been in between my legs moments before. I couldn’t take my eyes off—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
