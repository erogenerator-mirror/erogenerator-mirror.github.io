She always responded, and seemed to have a natural ability to make people feel that way. This is one of her main weaknesses. If she was going to give pleasure, she'd let every one of her holes get a workout every night. However, she never seemed to feel as good as she did when I was fucking her cunt. It's not that she really didn't like it, but for someone of our high position, it was probably because she seemed so eager to please. She certainly didn't complain about being humiliated, or about her looks. Lily always smiled her best smile and showed respect, and always seemed to give great pleasure when I gave it to her. We both agreed to follow our roles, and in some ways we were very much alike. I'd become somewhat possessive in our relationship, and if Liz told me to do it, I'd do it without question.</p> <p>"Do you like it?" Liz asked her.</p> <p>"It's beautiful," Lily replied.</p> <p>"It feels so good," my girlfriend added.</p> <p>There was definitely more to our relationship than just friendship in general. I knew that we could both be open to anything we wanted to do, and Liz liked to dress up a bit more than she wore, so it didn't seem as though we had any sort of conflict to lose. In fact, I found it very liberating to dress as I knew Lily liked to. It certainly wouldn't be as much fun if I'd have to put on a costume or make a show for her; that would only add to my embarrassment, and it would be like playing a role I already knew nothing about. But I had always thought Lily was much more open-minded and accepting of our relationship than most. Liz had no problem with it.</p> <p>"Show me!" Lily excitedly replied to me.</p> <p>We walked to our room together. Liz lay down on the bed and opened her legs. I stripped slowly, watching as my cock stood proud and waiting for her. I felt I was going to get an immediate erection from what I was seeing. I crawled on the bed and got onto all fours as my girlfriend crawled on the other side of Lily.</p> <p>Lily was naked, and I could clearly see every detail of her nakedness. She had a beautiful petite body covered in a light sheen of sweat. Her breasts were small and perky, and her nipples were standing up hard and erect. She looked incredibly sexy, and I loved it. I could smell her arousal as I slowly crawled closer towards her so I could kiss her passionately. My girlfriend's pussy smelled like honeysuckle, and that caused me to want to taste her so much. I wanted to devour her pussy, but she had other ideas.</p> <p>"I want you in me. I want you to make love to me," Lily said.</p> <p>I climbed down off the bed and knelt on the floor, my face between her legs. I could see every inch of her exposed skin as I slid my hands up her thighs and pressed my mouth against her pussy lips. The scent was familiar. As warm and sweet as I'd smelled before, this time I'd taste Lily again. I didn't think she'd be able to tolerate that after the night I'd had with my roommate. And I certainly didn't think I could. I could barely breathe. Lily tasted salty and tangy, like watermelon in a glass. I kissed deeply and lapped at her juices.</p> <p>"This is so hot," Lily moaned. "I want you in me, Jack."</p> <p>I couldn't believe how loud she was, so far away from everything she'd been doing. She had to be over twice my size now! I was so turned on! I didn't think it would be so long before I would reach some kind of orgasm right there in this bed. But I managed to control myself.</p> <p>"I want you to come in my mouth," I said as my mouth opened to invite her.</p> <p>Lily had a surprised look on her face. I didn't get that many chances to make a move on her like I usually did. Lily was not a shy girl. She was not a prudish teenager, just a little timid. She never seemed to get the opportunity to make her own choices, and was the result of many of mine. Of course, we were both a bit inexperienced as I had little experience at cunnilingus, either in or out of it. The opportunity to make love to Lily was something I certainly was going to be happy to get to do every night for the next month or so. There was a lot more room in my sex life after allâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
