My balls slapped down into her ass with each thrust. Kelly moaned her approval. She spread her legs and began to hump her ass back at me, driving two fingers inside her pussy and her fingers inside her asshole. I grabbed her thighs and began to pound my cock in and out of her cunt with quick, short strokes every time. Kelly’s body jolted with every hard thrust of my cock into her.</p> <p>“Harder!” Kelly demanded. She slammed her ass back at me harder now. “Fuck my tight pussy!” she chanted. “Ohhh god! I’m going to cum!” she cried. I could feel her body start to shake and she tensed up. I knew her pussy was about to cum. I slammed my cock deep inside her hard and she cried out in pleasure. Kelly shook and shimmied from the force of her climax. She slumped back onto the bed. I felt her juices running down my hand. There was a large wet spot on the bed on which there was a large pool of them.</p> <p>Kelly slid forward and kissed me. She took a small step forward, opened her mouth and softly ran her tongue across mine. I reached to the side and gathered up some of the wetness on her lips. She placed her head back and closed her eyes. I ran my tongue in circles on her lips and then down her throat. I pulled my face away and looked into her eyes. Kelly smiled a sexy smile.</p> <p>“Mm, that was good,” she said with a little breathy. “It looked like I got a lot of you inside me though.” She put her hand on my back, and continued to rub against me. I pushed my cock at her with my hand. It slid in between her thighs easily. She rubbed her pelvis against mine. I pulled my hard cock out of her, but did not pull it back as soon as it was out of her. She slid down and slid up my entire body, kissing me and then back to me. We kissed some more. We turned off the bed and got out of bed. I pulled on my boxers and jeans and put my tee-shirt back on.</p> <p>Kelly got dressed and then walked back to her window and looked into the house. Her bedroom door was locked when she closed it but she also left the blinds on. “I can’t see anything out there,” she said. I could hear her laughing as she stepped towards her door. My heart raced and my hand slid down to my crotch.</p> <p>She shut the door and came back. She grabbed my shoulder and kissed me. Her tongue flicked inside my mouth. I tried to get closer to her, but we were only a few feet away. She leaned forward and gently kissed me. We shared a kiss like we had only done in the past. I felt her teeth scrape my lips as her tongue worked its magic. I began to feel my body respond. I could feel my hard dick rub against her thigh.</p> <p>“It’s time,” I said, “Time for what?”</p> <p>Kelly laughed again</p> <p>“I’m not sure exactly,” she said as she walked out of the bedroom. She came back with a condom. “It’s up to you,” she said. I took hold of my cock and slipped it into the rubber on the end. She quickly took the condom from me and rolled it on my cock. She took a condom from her purse, handed it to me and sat down on the couch in the bedroom. We kissed a few moments.</p> <p>“I love you,” Kelly said, almost as she was speaking of her body. She kissed me again a long time. I reached down and lifted her leg and placed the end of it over my shoulder. She put her hands on my chest and pulled me to her. I lowered my lips to hers. She moaned as we kissed. I pressed our bodies tighter against each other. She ran her hands over my naked chest and down my thighs. I reached down and put my hand down on her thigh. I began to stroke her outer lips. She pushed herself harder against me.</p> <p>I pushed her up against the wall with my hand, as I pressed my body toward her. She put her arms around my neck and pressed her breasts against my chest. I had the tip of my penis against her wet pussy. She pulled away with me. “Wait,” she said in frustration in her tone. “I don’t have any condoms with me today,” she said. “I would be really disappointed if—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
