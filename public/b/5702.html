In other words, a guy may have an orgasm only if and when he gets a hard penis up inside him! It's not just that he has to be aroused and excited by having that pleasure. You may find that having it done to you by a guy makes it feel really real!</p> <p>Let me tell you, that with some things, your body does respond like it does for the pleasure it is giving yourself. And if you want to do something else for a change - to be able to do this yourself, just tell me. Oh, right, I want to tell you that the first thing I want you to do is to lick off all the precum I got off of him."</p> <p>I was really impressed. Of course, I would get a lot of that, right?</p> <p>I thought she was gonna run off and tell the boss, that was a great idea, and then tell him I really needed his hand on my tits! I was surprised when she suggested that. I think I surprised her with more than a little pride in the fact that she'd suggested such a thing, but I think she really was just surprised to hear me tell myself.</p> <p>When I told her that, she said "No way!" Then she had an amused look on her face. "No way? We're going to do it!"</p> <p>I told her I would, and for the next two hours, she was the only one outside of the room, with my mouth locked shut, tied up and blindfolded. "Oh, man, I'm going to cum, aren't I?" she asked.</p> <p>I nodded. "That's what everyone who has been there likes to do, too. I didn't know, you know. But I guess that makes it fun."</p> <p>"Oh, I don't know if I want to do it, or if I'd like you to do it. I'm probably all worked up at the moment anyways - I'm a really high-way."</p> <p>I nodded in response. "Yes. I think you will too. Are you excited?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes. And excited about doing something so very naughty to you."</p> <p>"Well, what's that?"</p> <p>"I'm not sure, but I think that's a great question," I said. "If you've ever tried it before, would you think this was a good idea?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes! This really is a chance!"</p> <p>"Good," I said. This was one big night ahead.</p> <p>And with that, I untied her ankles, so that she was left totally open for my oral and hand work. I took the nipple clamps off of her. She gasped - like when I first do it to her, but it seems to last for a long time.</p> <p>"There's some sort of rule about them, right? Oh, right!" I clamped them onto to her as she reached a very high orgasm. "They're very special!" I said, as she came hard.</p> <p>"Yes! Oh - please, yes!"</p> <p>I was proud to have made a young woman who could have any man she desired, but to have her beg me over and over to please her like that was quite amazing! I did not want her to ever get bored and get frustrated.</p> <p>"There," I said. "There's only one rule though, and so is a little something called 'tit clamping'. We've already discussed it, so how about it?"</p> <p>"You mean I do this?"</p> <p>"Of course. We'll discuss it over dinner."</p> <p>She nodded and I had no doubt, that she'd be delighted to do it.</p> <p>I sat her on the bed and went to the closet, returning with some kind of sort of soft leather strap on. I looked at it with interest and said "Ok, now you'll need a little bit of this. I'll get the belt. You'll need to get your panties off too."</p> <p>She nodded her acceptance and removed her skirt, panties and bra, taking them off, but in addition to the nipple clamps.</p> <p>"Good! Then you're going to enjoy licking that. I'm so impressed!"</p> <p>"Oh, I am. Please, lick me here, please! It's all about you, you know."</p> <p>She was really trying to get me to open my mouth - but just couldn't, so she put the end of the strap on the floor, and gently grabbed her hair, pulling her face away from her own pussy. Then she quickly began licking and sucking the whole thing, with no hands, not evenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
