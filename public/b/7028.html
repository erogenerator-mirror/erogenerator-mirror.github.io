"I just love fucking you" he breathed once again into her ear.</p> <p>She could feel her sex contract against her own fingers as she moved her lips slightly. He kissed her neck now and moved quickly down her body, her lips opening as his head pushed against her wet sex. He pushed into her slowly, feeling her relax her wetness to let him in. His head was right now, and in her ass.</p> <p>Again and again, he went, sliding his long member in and out of her ass hole, getting a finger in and out with each thrust.</p> <p>Her pussy was aching as he pressed the head into her, wanting more, and then his eyes closed once again.</p> <p>He wanted to please her now, too, for the first time in a long time.</p> <p>Her hands were on him, kneading his back. She couldn't believe she was feeling herself again, and it was just so awesome.</p> <p>He pulled out of her ass and his cock glistened in the lights of the room as it left the tight hole.

She loved it.</p> <p>He was fucking her ass again, and his cock in her pussy. They could barely feel it as his hand slid to the front of his cock, which had hardened again. He moved her hips, fucking her ass with each stroke. He couldn't seem to get enough of her ass.</p> <p>Just knowing he was fucking her ass now, not her pussy, felt so good. Like fucking a hot furnace, his cock was like a furnace.</p> <p>He would use her like that for longer periods of time, just fucking her.</p> <p>His hand came off her shoulder, then up to her face. She turned her face to kiss him.</p> <p>"I'm sorry for not being able to help you sooner, baby," he whispered into her ear.
