I decided that I should just give him something to wear.</p> <p>"Will I be allowed to wear anything when you're with you friends?" I asked him.</p> <p>"Sure, whatever you want." He replied.</p> <p>I sat up on the side of the bed and started to read what he had written. I wanted to read a lot of it, but I wanted to have some kind of effect on him.</p> <p>"Okay, I'm going to wear this dress." I said and walked into the bathroom.</p> <p>When I came back a moment later, he was on the bed dressed only in a pair of gray slacks and a black vest under which his shirt was open and he had the top two buttons open. He has a great body, I thought but his expression was one of amusement. His eyes were full of hope and he had a smile on his lips.</p> <p>"How do I look?" I asked him.</p> <p>"Absolutely stunning." He replied.</p> <p>"Thank you."</p> <p>We hugged and kissed, our tongues met again and I could taste myself on his lips. We looked each other in the eyes.</p> <p>"I'll get us another drink and go to dinner." I said.</p> <p>I kissed his cheek and he gave me his hand and we went out.</p> <p>The wedding was the wedding of a brother. At least, I assumed that was what he would have done but there was a lot more than just a day, another day, as it turned out.</p> <p>When the night of the reception ended they came together and we all walked down the aisle together. Everyone loved him, and I think my friends in college had a similar reaction to him.</p> <p>After the reception the big speeches were over and we moved to a private room. I turned on a few of the bands that were playing on stage, I wanted to see them with my father. Everyone stood in front of us, and the big room was mostly empty.</p> <p>"I think we'll start with something nice to go over before we get married." I announced.</p> <p>I sat him down on the side of the room and kissed him deeply and passionately. I wrapped my arms around him and he wrapped his around me, we were kissing like that for what seemed like minutes. And then it was over.</p> <p>His mouth was so tender, he made me feel like I wanted to stay in this place forever. The music started again and I leaned over and whispered to him,</p> <p>"Go take your jacket off."</p> <p>He looked so vulnerable just standing there smiling and he did as he was told.</p> <p>As the music played, there were cheers for him. I told him what to do, and he seemed happy enough to do it. He looked up at me, and then at the rest of the people sitting around him. I was still just as he was going down, he had his shirt open and it looked like he was on the edge of his seat trying to pull out what he knew he wanted.</p> <p>I got down on my knees before him, and gently began to unbutton his shirt. My hands were so soft with his head on them, so unlike the men I had danced with before. I could feel his body and feel the softness of his skin under my hands.</p> <p>"Oh you are so lovely." I whispered into his ear.</p> <p>I ran my hands over every inch of him, feeling at times like when I was the one dancing with them. I wanted to kiss all of his features. All of my parts. God I wanted to just sit in his lap and kiss him all night.</p> <p>I had his shirt open now and was licking his chest hairs with my tongue. I kissed the top of his chest as though I were kissing a lover. I had one of my hands caressing his stomach, he had his head leaning back.</p> <p>"Oh God." he moaned as his hands started to run over my body.</p> <p>My right hand reached around and ran across his stomach, feeling for his belt but finding nothing. I pulled his pants open and grabbed hold of his hard shaft.</p> <p>"Let me get you out for a minute." I whispered.</p> <p>The music was so loud I could have walked around the room and heard it, I had the feeling he would hear it very soon.</p> <p>I started to kiss my way further down from his chest. Stopping at his nipples, I sucked and kissed each one, I then started to lick them. By this time my right hand had come back down and was stroking his wet shaft.</p> <p>"Baby, you have to take off your shirt." I saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
