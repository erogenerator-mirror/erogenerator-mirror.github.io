I said as I grabbed my dick and started stroking while I leaned against the wall of my room in a 69 position to try and make them as close to each other as I could. I continued to stroke with one hand as I gently sucked on Karen's pussy as her tongue found its way to my ear and began to explore my earlobe. "I want you to enjoy yourself as much as I was." She said as she started pulling up her t-shirt and squeezing my ass as if she were trying to drive her big tits around. Then she let out a laugh and said "You better not turn me down now. Come over anytime!" We agreed to meet her on the second week of our trip and we left for the airport where we would be picked up by the airport.</p> <p>On Tuesday, I put my phone in my computer and left a message for Karen to pick me up at the airport on Thursday. It was 2 weeks later when I noticed Karen leaving a note saying that she had arrived early after her flight and had spent the most time with her mom to help out her in getting us ready to visit her grandparents.</p> <p>As I looked back at Karen's mom who was still standing at the counter waiting for the package that she had opened and my eyes, she was staring at me with her brown eyes staring back. It was then that I noticed the fact that Karen's mom had a little bit of a sassy southern accent which she didn't normally have, but I was beginning to find her a bit more attractive.</p> <p>The following day I walked across the lobby to the front of the plane to pick up Karen and on my way back Karen came over to talk to me. She smiled at me and said "Honey I am going to take a quick shower to take my vitamins. Will you get me a glass of ice tea and help me get my luggage up to the plane. I have been so busy this past week that I have not been able to wait to see you when you get here. I had no clue how long you might have been in the shower with your parents" She finished as she bent down to pick up her bags and gave me a hug and a kiss. When she got to the elevator that we boarded we headed down to the terminal and waited for a small plane to take our bags up to our hotel.</p> <p>It had only been 15 minutes when I got my flight back here so I had a quick shower and got my suitcase and my bag to the hotel. As I walked back into the bedroom after getting the suitcase in the bedroom and getting the ice tea I noticed that the bed had just moved a little bit. The bed was about three thirds of the way up and it's headboard seemed to be just barely making room. I picked up the phone and dialed her father's number as I could just make out what she had said earlier. "Hi Steve! I hope you are not tired from your flight. I am just having a snack and got the food here for you guys to enjoy. You sound like you slept OK." She said into the phone. "Yeah just about." I responded.</p> <p>I left the phone on the desk just about half a quarter of the way up so that it would not bounce and make me nervous. I grabbed that tea and headed into the bathroom to clean up a little but not much. I found that the glass of water I grabbed from the bathroom sink and got under the shower. I got the water really running and started washing it off. As I was washing my cock was beginning to come back from being in my hand and I just had to do something to get it back. Not wanting to seem too anxious, I got up to the bathroom to see what was going on. Karen was just getting out of the shower when I came along and closed the bathroom door.</p> <p>I grabbed Karen's towel wrapped around her as I wrapped my towel around the back of my head. Karen, having taken a couple quick steps back into the main room, was still in her robes from our last trip. I pulled my own towel up to my collar and began to dry myself off a little. "Honey I am sorry. I did not mean to make you uncomfortable. I want to make you feel better and to give you some peace and quiet. " I said softly as I wrapped the towel around me and began to dry my hair, "I really want to talk with you so I just want a little chat so that we can decide what to do. You are going to have a lot of talking to do if you get up to go over to your parents tonight. But you can have the day of the rest of your life spent sleeping with my parents tonight if you give me the chance to do that. " My towel fell to the floor as I dropped it in the hamper and she got in between our towels. Karen took a towel that hadâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
