Her emotions were conflicted. She felt as if she too was going to explode. She saw a car parked in the lot beside her, but she did not know whom. Dani got out, shaking and feeling very self-doubt. With a shaking voice, she turned to say goodnight, but an image of his hand on his cock flashed through her head. She didn't respond to the image, at least not yet. She looked at herself in the mirror and was shocked at how excited she was. She wasn't exactly attracted to him. They were just friends, not lovers. "My parents wouldn't even talk about what I do," Dani said. She felt very foolish, and even more embarrassed when she started walking into the school. The rest of the day passed quickly. A group session ended almost right away. And, she had to stop at their locker. It didn't seem appropriate. She grabbed the keys and walked as carefully as she could to the men's locker room.</p> <p>She entered quietly, and stood there for a moment. She looked around and saw a group of guys and one girl. It appeared to be in a group. Dani had been following other girls as she had gotten up to the lockers, but now she noticed that there were all different sized ones. She was surprised. She looked back at the locker and saw that it was empty, so she went around the front. She checked the door, and saw that it wasn't locked. "Oh, fuck!" she cursed inwardly once more. She pulled on the locker key and opened it out. "What the shit is going on?" she called out. The lock clicked, and she heard a giggle come. She opened the door, and entered a stall. "I'm sorry, it's just..." she paused and stopped. She glanced at the door to the other locker. She could feel his eyes on her and was afraid that she might get caught. She couldn't. She looked through the glass. No one else was locked that way. Not a stitch. She pushed the door open. She saw the lock clicked, and closed off. She was so relieved that she was able to control her fear. She felt the tears slide down her face as she saw the black stall door with its four foot slats opening. A dark blue door, that had to be it, opened.</p> <p>Danielle turned from the stall. She grabbed for his shirt. "Where are you going?" she asked. She felt him reach around her, but quickly pulled away from his grasp.</p> <p>"I'm sorry." He said. "You don't have to tell me that I didn't do it. I would've understood if you did." He held her arms, and she melted with his touch.</p> <p>"No," she whispered.</p> <p>"Of course not." He rubbed her arm. "It wasn't your fault. There is nothing to be sorry for. After all, I had already seen the way you look at me." He smiled. "I wanted to tell you that I was going to try to help you."</p> <p>She held her head back, and he stroked her cheek tenderly.</p> <p>"Thank you. I really needed to talk to you."</p> <p>Danielle sat on the seat. She closed her eyes as she sobbed, her tears trickling.</p> <p>It took five minutes before she was free. She pulled his shirt from his pants, and he had to force himself to put the shirt back on. He sat beside her, her fingers in his hair. Danielle sobbed, and then broke down.</p> <p>"I'm sorry I ruined your life," she said.</p> <p>"Don't worry about it. I had to do it. I didn't expect it. Besides, I have to get back home before my mom gets home in a huff." His voice went to a whisper. "Where are we going?"</p> <p>Dani just shook her head. "We can't stay in here all night." Dani shook her head again.</p> <p>"No. I can't," she agreed.</p> <p>"It's alright." He leaned over to kiss. "I will see you later." He leaned over to kiss her again, but then stepped away. Dani stood. She couldn't face him, or anyone for that matter, so she just turned and started walking away. In the short walk to the school building, she felt tears well in her eyes. She turned back, and felt him press his body up against her.</p> <p>"Dani?" She looked up. Her father stood nearby. "Dani! What, what is wrong?" He held out his hand and shook her hand. "Dani. Call your mom."</p> <p>She pulled out her phone and dialed a number. â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
