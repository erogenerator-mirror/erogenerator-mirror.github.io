His mouth moved and then opened, a smile slowly spreading across his lips.</p> <p>"Wow," I said, still laughing.</p> <p>"Yeah," he chimed in, "I've always wondered what it'd be like to kiss a girl."</p> <p>"And if this isn't it?"</p> <p>"You bet, dude!" Mike replied, with a quick wink. I could tell that he wanted more than this to just play around like a normal guy, but knew that he wanted to take things to the next level. I had made this a fantasy, so this was one.</p> <p>I took a step towards the door to meet him as he entered. When I stood out of the doorway, he grabbed my hand and pulled me around to the other side of the living room where he closed the door behind us. I was about to object, but couldn't. I could feel his hands moving up my legs, stopping near the hem of my skirt. He was looking back down at my face, his eyes almost gliding over every inch of my body as he ran his fingers up to the hem of my skirt, just short enough that he could easily caress my naked thigh. His hands moved to my upper thighs, sliding up and down, occasionally brushing against my panties, sending jolts of desire through my body. His hands continued to move in a gentle but steady pattern, slowly up and down the inside of my thighs, brushing from my lower leg to just a couple inches below my knee. The feel of his hands running up my thighs gave me goose bumps from the chill of the room, and my breathing quickened.</p> <p>"Do you really want me to wait for you guys to leave?" I asked coyly.</p> <p>"Of course," he replied, in a matter-of-fact manner. "But it's going to take a lot of convincing."</p> <p>I could feel my panties getting wet just from his talk. In fact, I wanted him so badly if he was actually thinking the whole thing through.</p> <p>"Okay dude." I replied, not being as sure as I would have been without him. I knew that Mike was just that, dude. He was a natural cock-teaser, but I knew that he genuinely wanted me for real. And not just in bed, though I suspected that he fantasized about more than that.</p> <p>Mike ran his hands up my thighs, his fingers brushing against my panties. He took one of my legs and lifted it off the ground, his hands now touching as much of my body as he could. When I felt his fingers lightly touching and teasing my panties, I felt the electricity of his touch run through the entire length of my very being.</p> <p>"Well..." I said, a question in my voice, trying to play coy. "How long?" I said.</p> <p>He grinned devilishly. "We can keep this little surprise a secret. I think you'll find it in your own fantasies. What is your desire?" He asked.</p> <p>"I think I want you to go down on me," I replied. "I want to feel you all over my body. It's just going to be a little more than just a game."</p> <p>"Really?" he retorted. "We can play that for a while if you want," he offered.</p> <p>All of my resistance was gone, and my mind was free to play with other ideas. I wanted him to just put his fingers in my panties and finger me, knowing that I'd probably explode at his touch again.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I asked, my voice sounding excited. "We just might be a little late."</p> <p>"That's fine," he said. "This is gonna be exciting. I can almost guarantee I'll cum all over your beautiful body," he whispered as his fingers slid upwards.</p> <p>I didn't wait for him to answer, but just went back to the chair and laid back against the armrest. When he slid his fingers over the fabric of my panties, I couldn't help it. I reached up and gripped his upper arms with my hands. He didn't disappoint and pulled my panties off of my knees and tossed them aside. It seemed like a good start to the game, and I decided to give him more of the prize. I leaned into him, our lips practically touching. I could feel his cock pressing directly into my stomach as we kissed. His hands ran up and down my thighs, and I could feel the muscles relax slightly at each movement. He was starting to have a hard time breathing, which only made it feel better. After he stopped sucking on my fingers, I reached down and pulled his boxer briefs down a little by tugging on the elastic. As he lifted his hips, I slidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
