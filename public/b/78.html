It's just that, well ..."</p> <p>"You might as well finish too, because I'm going to be really disappointed in myself if I don't take you upstairs right now."</p> <p>He leaned down, kissed her and stood back.</p> <p>"I'd better go."</p> <p>She followed Mike down to the basement and up to the main door. Once the door was securely shut she unlocked it and got in the car; the rest of her plans for the evening were in the back.</p> <p>Mike headed to the hotel and had to ask Rachel if he could get room service or someplace to park. Mike didn't want to get out of bed while the food was cooking so he got it. He had also been looking forward to taking off for the gym, so that he was in shape to take a quick shower and then he called the pizza place for the pizza and some ice.</p> <p>At the hotel the rest of the day was pretty uneventful as he checked out of the hotel and headed to his room. First, he called his cell again and was surprised to get a voice mail.</p> <p>"Hello honey. Yes, I'm at the gym. I'm wearing a new black pair of shorts, a white shirt, and black sandals. See, you can see a bit of cleavage and I'm walking with you. I'm really feeling pretty good about ourselves and the things that we're enjoying. What's up?"</p> <p>"Nothing. I just wanted to tell you that I'm heading to the gym in a couple days. No more shopping, but I wanted to tell you that I'm really looking forward to that trip."</p> <p>"Yeah, you're sure doing that. And no more shopping either. I'm on my way up now."</p> <p>"I was hoping that we could meet tonight so we can start talking about what kind of fun he's got."</p> <p>"I'm glad that we're getting along now but I can't say that I'm looking forward to it either."</p> <p>"I know but we had a lot of fun last night. I hope that we can do this some more. I hope that I can make up for it by coming home with you. I know that we could just go back to our room if you'd like."</p> <p>"Maybe we could. But, can we go with that tomorrow?"</p> <p>"If that goes well, I'll call you tomorrow and let you know how things went."</p> <p>"I look forward to having a wonderful time with you. And I hope that both of us have a wonderful time."</p> <p>"You know that we are going to have a great time and I don't want to have to do anything other than wait for you to go home."</p> <p>"I know. You just keep me on my toes forever."</p> <p>Mike hung up and called his sister; she answered and said that she was going to get ready for Mike for their anniversary. When he got to the office he saw the mail that he was looking for on his desk. He opened it and pulled out a small stack of junk mail and found a little poem from Rachel. He grabbed his things and went back to the office to get his paper work. He was surprised to see that the work that he had in earlier was getting canceled; it was a very bad day.</p> <p>It was then that he realized that it was his birthday and he was thinking that maybe he should get some more of his birthday present. Thinking about it for a moment, he pulled the cards out again and put one into the envelope and then he set one down in front of him. It wasn't exactly something that he would normally do, but he thought that she might like it. He put his things into his briefcase and headed down to the gym on his way back to the table that he was staying at for his birthday.</p> <p>He made his way around the gym and then took a seat in one of the folding chairs that he had put out the last time. He didn't have to stay and talk to Rachel, so he had no reason to look down at him or talk to him. He just sat there listening to the music that she was listening to throughout the day. As he lay there on his side on the chair, he suddenly felt very relaxed, but he couldn't help but feel that his situation was starting to take a real turn on him. This was his own problem, and he didn't want to look back.</p> <p>He could smell the wine that she had put on the table and it definitely had an effect on him. The bottle of wine was the perfect complement for the alcohol that he had been sipping it today. He wanted the drink more than anything else in the world, but his thoughts were occupied.
