I lean over and give you a hard kiss; I know that it's the right thing to do, just say "What the fuck..."</p> <p>"I can do that, babe!" You cry out.</p> <p>I slide my hand down your shirt and into your lap; I can feel your hard cock straining against your jeans.</p> <p>"Oh fuck yeah!" you groan, "Oh my god, I've wanted to touch you for months..." I moan, teasing and rubbing your swollen head through your pants. I lift my dress up over you and lower my panties.</p> <p>"Ooooooooooh," you gasp. You feel my wetness as I rub my labia through my lips, spreading them as I slide them down my thighs... I look at you and smile, knowing that I'm dripping wet. I grab your head and pull your mouth down onto me, and I can no longer suppress my cry of ecstasy as you slide your tongue between my lips, tasting my juices on your tongue. You move up the head of my slit, and I moan; you want to feel how good I'm feeling so you slip your tongue between my lips into me and I push hard against your face, as you feel me arch up into you; you feel me clamp down on your tongue and suck it, feeling me throb against you... I lean forward and lift my face as we kiss, and I kiss your breasts, as we kiss, and your body aches for me. I rub my hands over your thighs and down to your cock, and feel it throb against my body as you lean hard against me and grind your hardness against me, my ass squirming against your crotch.</p> <p>The two of us are lost in passion and lust. You can't feel my legs under you anymore and you stop when you feel your cock throb against my wetness, as the swollen helmet strains against my opening. You feel the heat spreading through you as my hips jerk against you, pushing up against you, feeling the wetness and the silk of my dress as I tremble. I grind against you, feeling your cockhead pressing against me, the hardness of your body and the heat as I tremble against it.</p> <p>"Do you want me to fuck you?" You whisper, and my head shakes, my face contorts and I let out a long and hard sigh, as you press down into me, as your hands move with my hips... The warmth of your cock and my warmth makes me shudder and I can no longer resist...</p> <p>"Oh please... I can't... just... oooooooooohhh!!" I cry out, as I feel your cock pressing against my swollen lips again... and then you drive deep into me, as I arch up again... I moan and cry out, as you feel me grasping you... I grind faster against your cock, so full of your hardness, as you lift me up to meet you...</p> <p>The feeling of your cock in my opening makes me tremble and feel myself open to your hot flesh, as it slowly moves into me... I feel you move with me, as you continue to rub your cock against my lips... I feel your legs against my thighs, as we are both sweating, making it feel like you're naked under the hot sun. Suddenly I feel you pulling me back, as you thrust into me once more, as you thrust your cock into so deeply, I feel it sliding deeper... deeper it is, and I feel your body tightening against me...</p> <p>You can feel me tense... it's so tight... your cock feels so hard against me, as your entire body is throbbing, that I'm so filled...</p> <p>And then you are pumping into me again as you hold on to my hips... You can't feel a thing... you are just on fire... as you continue to thrust into me...</p> <p>"Ohhhhhhh..." I moan, as you continue to thrust, as you take me and it's so wonderful... Oh god...</p> <p>I can feel you getting tighter, in me, against me...</p> <p>I can feel that your hands are digging into my ass, as you are thrusting into me... you can't hold back any longer... and then you're cumming inside of me... I can feel it as your body spasms against me... then I'm done, as we are both covered in sweat, as we lay there, as I wrap my arms around you....</p> <p>You're lying beside me. I can hardly move.</p> <p>We lie together... I feel so exhausted at this point... as you hold me, as you feel me shaking against you... I can feel our hearts beating... as I can feel your heart pounding with happiness. You can't think... no words can be said... we can't exist togetherâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
