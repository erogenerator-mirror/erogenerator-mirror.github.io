This was different from the last few times we'd been together. I felt a little guilty. Rebecca took it as her consent to the girl that I wanted. I moved to the bottom of the staircase and took them both in my arms.</p> <p>"We'll be in the car in about an hour," Rebecca said softly. "It's still light outside. We should have at least finished before anyone else."</p> <p>I pulled away from Rebecca and walked towards the door. They both turned towards me. "And just think why are we waiting? It's as if I didn't leave you alone in the middle of the night. I was going to come right in, but didn't. I'm glad you're okay with us. We'll need to hurry." She laughed. "As long as I'm with you. Now, have you got your clothes on?"</p> <p>I didn't even hesitate before following Rebecca in her car and taking off all my clothes. When I reached the car, I turned to Rebecca and began kissing her cheek and face the same as I had the previous time. Rebecca leaned in and gave me a quick kiss on the cheek.</p> <p>"That was fast." She laughed. "You sure were hot!"</p> <p>I smiled at her approving of my body and the way Rebecca's eyes devoured everything I had on. She leaned in and kissed the side of my neck.</p> <p>"And you still look like a girl," she finished.</p> <p>I smiled broadly and got in the car.</p> <p>"You sure are a girl," I thought to myself as I drove us back to campus, back to the girl who had made it clear I wanted her.</p> <p>I parked the car and walked over to Rebecca's house. Rebecca was still waiting for me and took my hand to guide me into her house.</p> <p>"Take your clothes off, but leave something else on," she said.</p> <p>I looked at her puzzled. I was nervous. "Did I really do this?" I thought to myself.</p> <p>"No," Rebecca laughed. "You did a great job tonight baby."</p> <p>I stared at her for a second. She seemed genuinely happy I'd taken the courage to do so.</p> <p>"I just need some help. Help from you. You were so willing to play."</p> <p>My eyes went to her, taking her in and noting her petite frame. I looked at her breasts for a second as I undid the buttons on my shirt. The cool air on my chest caused a chill of relief to flow through me as Rebecca smiled. "You look ready for me to fuck," she said as she pulled off her clothes and lay back, pulling me down with her on top of her.</p> <p>Rebecca kissed me, but held me for what seemed like an eternity as we hugged each other and ground down on one another. I felt like a kid on Christmas morning. We went at it for minutes, but we were both breathing hard. We'd waited all our lives for the chance to make love, but now it seemed like it was all about time.</p> <p>When the tension subsided, I broke off and asked "Can we go again?"</p> <p>She reached over and took my hand. "I don't see why I can't make passionate love to you!"</p> <p>Rebecca began caressing me again and I was hard as steel. "I want to make love with you, so I'll just have to lie here with you and think about how incredible everything has been."</p> <p>She smiled at the idea of lying there on the couch, but didn't say anything.</p> <p>I got up and kissed her as I stood from the sofa. "I'll come back when you're ready, Rebecca."</p> <p>"I'll be ready in the morning," she replied.</p> <p>I left her in the kitchen and returned to the bedroom, naked as I came. She looked at her reflection in the mirror. She seemed pleased that she couldn't be anymore embarrassed about not being able to sleep. She knew she had gotten more than half the fun she'd had tonight.</p> <p>I left her bedroom door open until I heard Rebecca go into the laundry room. I sat and turned on the light in the bathroom. I looked at the clock and saw the light went out. For a brief instant, I couldn't figure out where I could sleep. I thought I'd just go to the couch and wait for Rebecca. I heard her coming back out of the laundry room. Her voice was calm, almost non-â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
