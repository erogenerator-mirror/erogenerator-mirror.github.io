"But can I get you a drink? I don't want to be here looking like this all the time." She added, sipping her rum and cuzzler. A few drinks were good and I really had to agree with my eyes.</p> <p>"Sure, that would be great. I'm about to go over to your place." I said. "That way we get to be alone and have a good time."</p> <p>She took another pull. "Really?"</p> <p>"Really. You?" I said, not even giving her a second look before taking the next sip.</p> <p>"I am a little nervous," she told me. "You don't really like to drink do you? Maybe it's time to turn that down."</p> <p>"No! No, it's fine if you would like." I replied.</p> <p>She looked up at me, biting her bottom lip. "I can't do that. I'm drunk, it's just wine." She said, her expression suddenly thoughtful.</p> <p>"Well OK, I guess for wine, I'm afraid." I assured her.</p> <p>"So I don't have to go to your place when you left?"</p> <p>"No, no you don't." I said. "I mean, it's just that, well, it's not like we're drinking anymore."</p> <p>"What the hell, I just figured that."</p> <p>I took another drink and then offered her another one.</p> <p>"It's just that, well, it feels that way. It's just that, well the thought of you drinking, all of that wine, and all of the drugs on the table, and here you are with the most awesome guy I've ever met."</p> <p>"Oh, thank you," she said, a smile spreading over her face again, as her hand moved over to pat my leg. She seemed to be trying to be reassuring this time. "I don't really have a choice. All I have to do is wait until you get home and you'll see the lights go out."</p> <p>"You don't know what that means do you?" I said with a laugh.</p> <p>"I never knew. It feels like I was always too young at the age of eight. You'll make a really good teacher." She said, her hand feeling my leg again. I could feel her leg moving up and down under mine. I was already starting to get wet there just thinking about it.</p> <p>"I thought so." I said to her as I finished my first of four beers.</p> <p>"Yeah, well, you got me started that way." She said, taking another pull.</p> <p>We made another round before I was ready to take some more. I'm not usually so easy to find so I put two more in front of her and then she took just a sip and started to let it slide down her throat.</p> <p>"You know, if this is any indication that you may be a little drunk, I think maybe I could let you do this in the hot tub." I said. I took another sip. Her hand was lightly rubbing just below my thigh. The alcohol in my system was already getting me horny again. I closed my eyes and let my head fall back against the bar. I didn't care how far this girl might take this. Her hands were just about as large as mine, they probably made it possible for her up to an inch and half to go higher still before she even touched me.</p> <p>As much as I was enjoying the alcohol, I had really never experienced that before. It felt pretty great. I could just barely make out the shape of a breast. The nipples looked like dark chocolate candy, begging to bite them. The skin at the end of the breast was thin and smooth, her skin seemed to be slightly warmer than a layer of salt. The nipples pushed up and down into the cool night air and were rock hard. It was hardening quickly, and she had her fingers just running over them just slightly. The hands were slowly working their way up, up to her neck and then back to just a little behind her ear. I could feel the tension leave her body as her breathing quickened. Her body stiffened then, and her eyes were starting to glaze. Her hands were now up to the hem of her sweater, and I realized that she had undone it. She had just pulled her sweater up and then let it fall. I wasn't going to let her get away with her sweater like that. I wanted to see her bra.</p> <p>I had not been going at it for quite a while. All that wine and booze helped keep my mind off of things. However, the alcohol was loosening me up a bit. I was suddenly getting a little dizzy, and wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
