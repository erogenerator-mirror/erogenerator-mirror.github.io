I can't think how I'll manage without my penis inside you."</p> <p>She giggled, as her tongue stroked my lower lip and then her lips found my bottom lip and licked again. "We may not have much time, but there is a first time for everything. This morning, the first time I ever felt this sexually aroused. It was like the sexual thrill of youth. You were very sweet, very gentle. I have never felt anything like that with anyone." I could feel myself beginning to have an uncontrollable desire, in front of my face. "Please don't," I said, knowing that as much as I really wanted this, for this moment it would have to be quick. That was all we had to do. As her hands reached for my erection and squeezed it, I pulled her towards me so that she was kneeling and she took almost all of my long penis at first. Then as she stood, I kissed her again and as she put on a lip curtsey, I slid my tongue into her mouth and then slowly withdrew until just the tip of my tongue was in her mouth.</p> <p>"We have to stop for a while," I said as I pulled back.</p> <p>"I'm afraid I don't have anywhere to put it... in me," she said, with a slightly embarrassed smile.</p> <p>"Please don't... put it up there," I said. "We'll finish and then go upstairs, to my bedroom, where I can lie on my bed and..."</p> <p>"Or... I can... go do some... you know... the same or... do you want... to do some... to you and... my... penis."</p> <p>"I don't mind... if you think that's a pretty idea," I said as we kissed again.</p> <p>I began to slide off the bed to the floor. I began to help her up and then my arms went around her. I pulled her to me. I felt her breasts pressing against my bare chest. I could feel her nipples harden against me as we kissed. My hand found her hip and my finger slid up her thigh, under her skirt. I felt her startle and then she grabbed the wrist of my fingers. Our eyes locked as we stopped, but soon she had her hand in mine and we moved to the sofa opposite the dressing room door.</p> <p>I knelt down and kissed her mouth, her face and her eyes. As we kissed I pulled my fingers from hers. I gently slid them in and out of her cunt, feeling the moisture and the texture as I caressed her flesh. I could feel the throbbing in her legs, so I reached forward and touched her clitoris. Her knees rose and fell as if she were in another world, as my fingers caressed her flesh. She grabbed the back of my head with her hands and thrust her tongue into my waiting lips. Her kisses became more urgent.</p> <p>"Fuck me," she said as she pulled me tight to her and then pulled my shorts off. My penis came into view, hard and ready. She knelt in a squatting position, lifted her skirt up over my head and sat on me with her bum pressing against my stomach. I felt her warm lips wrap around my penis and then as her legs closed over mine, she began the action again. I grabbed two handfuls of her breasts as I thrust into her. I could feel her muscles starting to move. She took her lips away from mine as she cried out with her own intense orgasm.</p> <p>Then I began to fuck her again. I pulled out and slid it slowly in. This time she took it as far as she could. I saw the flush on her face as I pushed myself in her and felt the tightness on my penis. She was panting, in her own world and almost as if she had been feeling my penis. "Mmmm, yes," she said. "You're filling me...up... so well." Her legs gripped my waist and we fucked and fucked and...</p> <p>I pulled out of her and we collapsed on the sofa. We kissed again and then she looked at me and said, "If that was an introduction to being with a man, I could never let you go again."</p> <p>"It is what it is," I said, smiling, pulling her up, putting my arm around her waist and we fell together on the floor.</p> <p>I had never felt more at peace with her. How could I be doing this with her, again? What in the world was I doing?</p> <p>*****</p> <p>When we came to, I made my way to the car. I thought this had gone too far. I had to be sure this was all not just a misunderstanding. It had to be something realâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
