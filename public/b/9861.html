Her hands slipped from my shoulders and onto my arms, squeezing me. Her breath came in pants, but her eyes stayed focused at the sight of me.</p> <p>Her voice caught for a second, and I had no idea what her mind was doing. "If you want, I can come with you. Maybe we can have a walk with that." I was trying to be sweet and give her my best, or worst, but I heard myself sigh as she pushed me against the wall. I looked back and saw a pair of long, thick boots on her feet. It was her, in my mind. But I couldn't see. She leaned forward, and her breasts fell over my face. I wanted to see more of her.</p> <p>"Yes," I grunted, my cock fully erect again. She pushed against my thigh in a slow, almost silent climb. "I think you can come here," I managed to say.</p> <p>"No," she pouted, sounding hurt. "I want to walk down a street."</p> <p>"A street?" I nodded toward where the buildings were.</p> <p>"Sure, but just for a while. I'm sure you understand, and I'm sure you'll go the whole way before you're done." I looked to her, realizing the look on her face. I shook my head, to convince myself that she was serious. I pulled my pants up, and slid off her boots. I pulled my shirt off, but had to leave the shoes off as I pulled my arms through. She was naked, except for her socks. I was in shock.</p> <p>It didn't seem she noticed as I stepped up to her. I put my hands on hers, not enough to hold them against her, but just enough so we were touching. She took her hands off my face, and ran them down my chest, over my stomach, and down my thighs. I gasped as she touched me. She leaned over and kissed the skin just below my cock, then pulled her hands back up on my chest again, rubbing her breasts against the hard muscles. She leaned back, pulling her arms free and letting me remove her socks before bringing them back up and off. She looked up at me, and a small smile crossed her lips.</p> <p>I wanted more of her, and her hands slid down to meet mine. We turned to face each other, and fell back on the cold, hard concrete floor. I pulled back the hood of her car, and started walking toward her as fast as I could. We were both so tense that I could barely think about it anymore. She was just taking control, and I didn't mind. I followed quickly behind her to the next street.</p> <p>I didn't even glance back as I walked there, not wanting to stop the two of us if I might lose the confidence. There were other people in the street, and I could hear people moving about, talking. She just stood there, taking it in both arms and smiling widely. Her hair was hanging loosely about her shoulder blades.</p> <p>I stopped just at the edge of the street, not a mile from where we parked. I looked up to see people getting out of cars, and talking to one group of people. I saw a couple of kids in the crowd, and knew they could see us. I wanted to go back. The walk was too awkward. I took a step back, and looked behind me. If someone had just stood up and seen us, we'd have walked out together. I stepped back, feeling a bit uncomfortable standing there with my feet planted firmly on asphalt. That was where we were.</p> <p>"Maybe you should leave now," I suggested. She was watching me.</p> <p>She just looked around, then dropped her head to the ground, "maybe we shouldn't even..."</p> <p>"Come along," I said, and pulled her toward me.</p> <p>We walked together, still smiling and looking around. The street was just as quiet as it always was—a small, empty group of people walking a half mile away from us. I was suddenly feeling at ease. It felt like a normal situation. People were walking, talking, talking, laughing, and holding hands. It felt good.</p> <p>I stopped to look around. I felt a little stupid, but didn't care. I hadn't been able to do anything for the last three days. She was standing in front of me, her feet planted firmly on the ground. I was sitting on the grass, looking out through the windshield.</p> <p>"Where do we go this time," she asked.</p> <p>She looked over at me, "Just like you did yesterday, the first day I got the idea."</p> <p>"That's fine. I want it to last this time."</p> <p>She reached for my hand, and pressed herself into me.
