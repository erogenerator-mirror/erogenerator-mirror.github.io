It felt too real and it wasn't just that I never wanted this. It felt too real and it wasn't just that I didn't want to live with him. It felt too real. It wasn't just that I couldn't live without Jason.</p> <p>As I thought about my life outside of Jason, I noticed my hand was shaking a little. Normally, I don't feel that bad when I'm cold and that I have a fear like I do when I start crying. I just wanted Jason and I didn't really know any other way of having someone.</p> <p>I wondered if this was it and if I were going to try again. I tried getting Jason to stop, but if I did that, then he wouldn't talk back once I let him go. Now I had to give some comfort to the people I lost and if this wasn't a lesson in my life, then I wouldn't bother trying.</p> <p>I went inside for a quick shower and tried to keep my cold body from making a racket as I dried off. When I came back, Jason was staring at a DVD on the wall while he was finishing dressing. He looked up when I walked by and smiled. He got up and walked over to the stereo and put on some soft music.</p> <p>"I didn't know you could dance so well."</p> <p>He leaned over and kissed me. I melted into him. I didn't even notice that Jason had put on the cd player. I could feel it playing in the corner of my eye as I felt the wetness between my legs grow.</p> <p>"You have a nice ass."</p> <p>"Thanks. I never even knew dancing could be so good."</p> <p>"I'm glad you liked dancing."</p> <p>"I love dancing, you just have to stop when you want to."</p> <p>He was a bit shocked that I said that to him. I'm not sure what turned him on more, the song or just the fact I said it.</p> <p>"Would you like to dance some of my favorite songs?"</p> <p>I felt his eyes taking in my body again.</p> <p>"God yes, you are a sexy woman."</p> <p>He leaned down and gave me a long kiss before he picked up the cd and played my favorite songs.</p> <p>After my shower, I walked back into Jason's bedroom. I pulled a dress over my head and put on a bra over the top of the dress. I stood there in front of his bed.</p> <p>"I'm sorry. I didn't know I was going to make you do this."</p> <p>"You're all too sexy to be sorry."</p> <p>"Do you have any idea how much I appreciate it?"</p> <p>He stood up and put his hands on his hips.</p> <p>"You know it isn't nice to make me do this."</p> <p>I walked over to him and put my hands on his shoulders.</p> <p>His hands were trembling slightly as I reached down and took his hands in mine.</p> <p>"Jason. Don't do this."</p> <p>"Don't what?"</p> <p>"I don't want to make love to you tonight."</p> <p>"We just can try for a few more minutes."</p> <p>He pulled me closer and leaned forward. I pulled the dress down and let his hands slide down my back. His fingers gently wrapped around my ass. I could feel his hands on my skin. I moaned as he gently squeezed my cheeks.</p> <p>He leaned back and looked at me.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want to do this?"</p> <p>I knew better than to make any decision while Jason was in a relationship. It wasn't like we'd be breaking up anytime soon again. I'd already had more than enough of his kisses and cuddling, but it was probably better waiting for him. This was only the third time I'd been with Jason and I couldn't just expect to be exclusive forever.</p> <p>"Maybe we can change the path of our relationship."</p> <p>His look was a bit of a surprise.</p> <p>"Well then, let me make you something to eat. Let me lay down on my stomach."</p> <p>I turned around to face him as I went down to the bed. In a soft voice I asked him if he felt the same about me?</p> <p>"Well, it's probably just different with you around."</p> <p>"I have to say, I'm not going to lie to you."</p> <p>"You won't."</p> <p>"You know I'm not going to lie to you. You're just going to have to accept me for who I am."</p> <p>I wanted to know what he was going to say nextâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
