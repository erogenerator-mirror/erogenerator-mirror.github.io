I said. I sat myself on the bed, my dick standing upright, I pulled her on it, it disappeared deep in her pussy.</p> <p>"No, this is how you'll do this!" she said, pushing me away. "Get on the bed and on your back! I'll do this the hard way!" she ordered. I took the prophylactic off her, slid it on, lying down.</p> <p>"What the fuck is this?" she asked, straddling me. I took her into my arms and kissed her, my dick making a squishy sound every time I entered her. The feel of her hot pussy on top of my dick was divine. It felt right. It took her a few moments to find her balance and start moving back and forth on my dick. We were both breathing hard when she got the hang of it and then she was moving back and forth on it, fucking me. It wasn't the best sex I'd ever had, but at least it was working. I reached up and squeezed her boobs, her nipples reacted to my touch.</p> <p>"Wow! That feels so good!" she cried out. "I think you just made me cum!" she added. I was about to tell her to fuck off when she started to move, just a bit slower, just a little faster.</p> <p>"Not yet! I need to take control!" she said. She began to move faster, leaning down and hugging me with her warm body.</p> <p>"Is it time?" I asked. She climbed off of me. She lay on the bed right where I'd left her.</p> <p>"Fuck me! Don't stop!" she cried out. My dick disappeared into her again. I took her by the neck and looked down into her eyes. Our eyes locked. She started to move her hips, fucking me again. I held her face up.</p> <p>"Do it to me!" she begged. I held her face in my hands as she moved herself on the bed. "Yes, yes, yes, oh yes!" she moaned. I did as she asked, pressing her head hard against my lips.</p> <p>"You like this don't you?" she asked. I nodded. She lowered her head. "Say it. Don't hold back," she said.</p> <p>"I do," I said. I kissed her, sliding my tongue in her mouth. I pulled her to me and we kissed, our hands massaging and stroking one another.</p> <p>"You're the best!" she said. I knew she wasn't finished by the way she was grinding on top of me.</p> <p>"Now you can do it in different ways," she said. "Take me on top." We lay there, kissing all over, our bodies slick and wet with sweat. She slid down, my dick was already back in her pussy. As soon as she had it she sat down and drove my dick home. It took her a second to reach a climax. I had already had mine, but I was already cumming. I was getting close.</p> <p>"I want your cum!" she cried. She bounced up and down on my dick. I grabbed both of her breasts, squeezing them, pinching her nipples, lifting them up and then sliding them back and forth. Oh God, I loved those. Every part of me responded to this. They were perfect!</p> <p>She was almost there, I felt it too. The feeling took over and she started to cum harder. She cried out my name, as well as her own. It was almost too much to tell just from my body. Her body went limp, she collapsed onto me, her hands and fingers held me close. I lay there, feeling her warmth surround me and just enjoy my moment.</p> <p>"You're so good," Janie said into my shoulder, "I can't believe how many times I've wanted it."</p> <p>"You're a terrific lover," I replied.</p> <p>She reached into the nightstand, found her nightcap and poured us both a glass of wine. "Here, you've earned another turn with me," she said, handing me the glass. As she downed her glass I took a sip.</p> <p>"You're good!" I smiled back.</p> <p>"I know," she said as she climbed off of me, stood on the bed. She bent over and took me in her mouth. She sucked, deep, trying to get my load in her mouth. I saw a drop of my sperm falling onto her face, it rolled down her neck. She turned and sucked my dick, cleaning the drops off.</p> <p>"Was that better than the past?" she said, holding herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
