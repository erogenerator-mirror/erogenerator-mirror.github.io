Our first stop was the grocery store. I was thinking about some of the things we had purchased but that was not the case. I was going to buy them from a local farmer. He would be my partner in the business and I would make the best out of the few we made so far. He was looking forward to it too.</p> <p>After several minutes of driving I decided to stop at his office. We drove out toward the city. There would never be a question we would be out. When we got there we entered our office and I told him to lock the door. He had a puzzled look on his face at my statement so I didn't do the same. He did as I said and went in and sat behind his desk. We had only been on the internet for about fifteen minutes when I spoke up.</p> <p>"I don't know how to begin with you." He said.</p> <p>I explained what I was doing to his face and the way I was taking advantage. He agreed but he was also becoming more nervous.</p> <p>"We need to be very discreet." I replied.</p> <p>"This is not a business like a relationship, not at all." he argued.</p> <p>I could see his confusion. I didn't give him an answer. I told him to get on with that. I had done my research and was going to be with him again. That said there was the possibility of things going to get out of control.</p> <p>"I don't feel like going any further." He stated and looked at his feet.</p> <p>"I don't think we should talk about anything." I said.</p> <p>"We shouldn't." He answered. "The one thing that has always been with us is sex. There will be no secrets between us. I am going to be very careful in this part of the business and if I think that something I don't want you to know becomes a little too comfortable... we will talk about it later today. I have to confess that I have been very selfish with how much I have taken for the last two years." he said as he continued his conversation.</p> <p>I could see that he was afraid to get up but I decided to see what he was afraid of. I sat next to him but didn't touch him. All he did was get his face in my face. I did that a lot but nothing more. We talked for a long time and I made sure he was still safe.</p> <p>After another hour or so we stopped at another motel. I told him that I needed to get home. I was taking what I thought that I was doing to him. We needed to get some rest. We got out of the car and walked upstairs. I opened the door and took him by the hand. Once in the room I locked the door and we held each other's hand. I moved forward and our mouths met. I slowly made my way to he and our mouths locked. Our hands moved slowly over each other's body until I pushed him onto the bed. His body reacted without warning. I could see his excitement begin to increase as I began to make my way to his cock. I looked at his face as we made our way to mutual release. He was breathing as if he were going to faint for us and I could tell he was. His body shivered as we kissed. Our bodies became entangled as we kissed and my hands were exploring the inside of his thighs. He pulled me closer and we quickly entered into each others embrace. Our kiss was becoming urgent as the fire of passion began between us. We kept the urgency to ourselves. As our kisses became more passionate the intensity built up.</p> <p>"Take me." I said. "Make my body yours."</p> <p>It was not a request but a promise. He pushed me down onto the bed and immediately joined me. Our tongues fought for control of each other as the fires raged. It was my turn now. I turned myself so that I was straddling him. Our bodies were in perfect harmony and I lifted myself up until our love organs were aligned. I placed his cock in my pussy. Slowly I slid my body onto the shaft which felt like granite. I could feel him on my stomach as our kiss never stopped. My hand rubbed across his face as our pace quickened. He held my breast in his hand as he thrust downward. Our tongues were dancing like a tornado and our moans mixed in harmonious harmony. My mouth hungrily consumed his mouth as we made love. Our love making was becoming more frantic as we tried to reach our goal. Our bodies began to move more fluidly together as our breathing intensified. My body was in complete bliss and I could feel my legs shaking uncontrollably. I loved his warmth and the feeling as it spread throughout my entire body. My body wanted to cum from this act but I had already cum from our lips and their contact onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
