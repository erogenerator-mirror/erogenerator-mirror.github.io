Amanda's voice brought me back to the moment. I had been a little worried that we were going to have sex while in bed, but now it was the highlight of my day. With my body still flushed, I rushed back to get him and took up where she had left off. I found him sitting on the bed in the living room where we had left him, waiting for Amanda and me to arrive. What a nice surprise! I jumped a little bit as he was talking to me, but then I saw Amanda and my eyes nearly popped out. "Oh my god!" she cried out as she finally settled to the bed. She was completely naked, looking very sexy. Her breasts were the most inviting of all of them, with a good amount of her breasts showing through and her neatly trimmed strawberry blonde mane flowing all around them. Her stomach was flat, but her legs were long and shapely, very attractive. Just looking at her made me want to grab the bed sheet and fall asleep. But she had taken it off completely, revealing just the top two buttons of her white silk shirt.</p> <p>"Hello?" I said excitedly. I couldn't believe it was even after 2 years of being with Amanda that I had finally been able to finally come out of the daze that had been going through my mind, and now, only in bed could I really believe her. She was in shock, and excited too. "Amanda, how much time has been lost?" I said nervously.</p> <p>"It's been only about 2 hours and we have the entire house to ourselves," Amanda said. She had been taking care of the house, but we had to be back by then, and the weather had been hot and we needed some fresh air. "How long it been?" she asked.</p> <p>I thought for a moment. "It wasn't long, but in only a couple minutes, and this time...I lost it completely."</p> <p>"Well, I'm glad you've come," she said with a little smile.</p> <p>"Me too. You gave me the best orgasm ever, babe." Amanda said, sitting up in the bed. She grabbed the blanket off the side and sat it over her shoulders revealing her amazing body. "I've had a crush on you for longer than I'll ever forget," she said, giving me a little kiss on the lips. "I'm sorry about the surprise, but...I think maybe we should take a break from our current plans," her voice trailed off as she looked me up and down. I could see her jaw line, a line of her black, thick eyelashes, through her lips and her face, which was absolutely beautiful.</p> <p>"Really?" Amanda smiled, "You really have to ask me twice."</p> <p>"Amandra," I asked, taking her hand. She smiled at me again, the same smile that I'd seen on hers a few hours ago. "I want to keep seeing you with someone else." I said as I looked back down at her. "I don't know what you're doing, but I don't care about anything, not if it's nothing."</p> <p>"Oh, no," she giggled, "don't worry, it feels good. But, you know, I still want a part..." she leaned in and kissed me.</p> <p>"Of course you will," I assured her, "And you know you'll always have me," I added as I moved closer to her. We kissed for another second as we kissed, Amanda tasting her lover for the first time, me tasting a slightly salty cum from her lover as we continued to explore each other through our kissing and caressing.</p> <p>"I want to go back in a time where you can be your friend all the time," Amanda said with a little smile in her voice. The moment of truth had finally arrived, and I couldn't go back any time soon. We both knew this was our last chance. With Amanda, all my doubts about whether or not her relationship is real vanished. We could still be together, and that was just about what anyone would be doing for the last 20 years. After a couple years of not having sex in bed with each other, I wanted her so badly right now. I wanted everything from her to me, and to have her with me forever...</p> <p>-oOo-â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
