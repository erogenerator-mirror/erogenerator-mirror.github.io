"Don't we want to hear what it's like?"</p> <p>"Yeah, sure. It's gonna be fun."</p> <p>* * * * *</p> <p>The house that she got was a ranchy old rustic house on a nice stretch of highway in a little town on the outskirts of Kentucky that was home to a few family farms. The property was surrounded by a small field that had a large fence running along the fence that went from the driveway to the barn and the driveway covered the fence and was fairly tall. A lot of trees were standing on the property like a tall bridge as the trees and bushes cut high and high on the field. A few picnic tables sat to the right and the front porch had a pool and a bench behind the fence. To the left was a barn with a large back yard and the front door was open and looked like it led to the back yard.</p> <p>Just like old times and it was a small ranch in the state of Tennessee.</p> <p>She stepped off the house porch and entered the house. The kitchen was set up as she had expected and there was a large patio at the center. She looked around and saw three couches and chairs laid out on the patio and another set up on the far side of the main house. The dining room was in the back, the entertainment table had a TV and stereo in it and there was a small side door with an old iron door to the side that led to the main house. She walked over to the other side of the house and into a bedroom that had the bed on one bed and a dresser on another. The master bedroom was a beautiful little room in a little back country style house and it had the biggest king sized bed ever built. The one wall was bare white with some gray trim on it. A window in the far left room had a large clear blue window that had just a few slivers of light coming through.</p> <p>It was obvious that the main house was a little different than other homes in this part of town and had a lot of windows and a lot of other windows to help look out a window. There were some trees and in the opposite bedroom there was a large screen on the wall in front of the window that showed pictures of different times that the place had been in this neighborhood when the place was in the south area. She got a little nervous. Maybe she should get dressed up while she was there. But she thought she would just go and check to see if her outfit would fit. She looked around at the house in a little panic.</p> <p>"It sure doesn't look like it's a good fit," she laughed to herself. "They all look like old mans. It's just that..."</p> <p>A hand ran up her thigh and her jaw nearly hit the floor. She turned to look at him. "You okay?" he asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, yeah. You? You?" she asked while trying to hold back the laugh.</p> <p>The hands moved up her leg, under her dress and felt her through her panties as he felt around her ass. "Yeah, I'm good," she said. He smiled and kissed her cheek gently. "Thanks for the outfit." Her fingers felt around his shorts for the first time, which she found to be quite a size too. "What are you gonna wear?" she asked.</p> <p>"Well, I'm not sure what I would wear, but I think this one will be good for some things," he answered. "Let me see. Your mom's dresses? You gonna be showing me those dresses again?" he asked as she pulled his pants down a bit too.</p> <p>"Mmm, yeah, maybe. I'll go change. But if you take off that shirt anyway, I think we would just walk out in front of the house and not walk over on the porch where we usually are. I don't feel comfortable. I don't know why I do it."</p> <p>He shrugged. "Yeah. I guess it doesn't bother me. Are you ready to go?"</p> <p>"Maybe," she said, smiling. "I'm actually really nervous."</p> <p>"No kidding. Are you nervous about having a stranger in here? You can trust me." He held her arm as she backed up through the house, turned around and followed her into the second bedroom. His eyes ran around the room as she crossed the room in front of the double doors. "Are there a lot of dressers?" he wondered.</p> <p>"There are a few on the other end. You could just take your shirt off if you want. But I think you would better use more than one, anyway."</p> <p>He smiled and looked around the room in front of him. "You think I would take them off if I came in here?" he askedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
