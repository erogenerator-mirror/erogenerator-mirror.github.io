"I've got to run," he said. "I hope you don't mind if we go for a drive before we go somewhere else. Maybe you know where we will go," he said.</p> <p>"Sure," I said, and we got out of the truck, headed for the house.</p> <p>"I can go to the hotel. I have a pool there."</p> <p>"I have it with me."</p> <p>"I do too. That's a lovely place, too large for just one big bed."</p> <p>"I could take one tonight."</p> <p>"I agree. Not much privacy. Just two places," I said as I reached for his hand. "Don't get in the pool with him. You can get in with you in the chair, while I get my keys," I teased.</p> <p>"Thanks." He walked me out to the parking lot, pulling me along with him a little behind, and we headed out towards the pool to enjoy our afternoon.</p> <p>"It is nice, isn't it, Mark?" I said as we parked, the rest of the way to my house.</p> <p>"I love the view out from the pool."</p> <p>"That's for me to enjoy. If you want me to join you in your garden, I'll do that, if you want me to."</p> <p>He didn't hesitate. He got out of his truck and went inside to get his keys. "Thank you for asking me to come along," he said, taking the keys and handing them over.</p> <p>"It was my pleasure," I said, taking them and taking mine. "If you don't mind, I'll take one of the bed for myself. You might like it on the patio over there."</p> <p>He turned right instead of going in that direction, so I pulled over to the nearest side of the lot, waiting for him to turn. He didn't say anything but opened his door, stepping quickly out into the hot-tub to get out, then went inside and came back out a moment later. He came over to me and pulled me into him again from the side before letting me out of the cab of his truck and went inside, turning back towards me with a twinkle in his eye.</p> <p>"You can join me now," he said.</p> <p>"Sure," I giggled and followed suit, following him out of the front door.</p> <p>There wasn't just the hot tub though. There was a pool with a picnic area on one side, a large pool table and a huge outdoor hot tub on the other. We took the seats out next to one another so I had the option to play with him or get laid.</p> <p>"Why don't you get yourself out here? I'm sure that would take my mind off of you. It would be easier to find someplace a little more private and it feels safe even when we're in public."</p> <p>"It's a bit out in the lot, Mark. It is a little cooler. It's probably time to lay down on the bench," I said. "Maybe we can do a little sunbathing."</p> <p>"No, I'm okay. It is pretty warm out there," he said. "Besides, I don't think my cock will need some cold oil in it."</p> <p>"Maybe you can just use that towel over there," I said as I lay on the bench and spread my arms and hips so he could get one on to see when he leaned down to slide into the water just a bit, then lay down on his back on the table.</p> <p>He got in behind me and moved up so his body was against my ass, his hands on my waist. He leaned over and kissed me on the neck, then his lips moved in to my shoulder so I had to slide down his body even more so his cock slid into me.</p> <p>"God you're tight," he said after a minute.</p> <p>"It's the fact that I'm almost twice the size that makes it that much work for me."</p> <p>"You mean you get to have the whole thing inside you once you get it up?" he said, grinning ear to ear.</p> <p>"Do you want me to wait a second and get it inside again," I asked, sliding down his body so his cock was inside of me.</p> <p>"You want to have my cock inside of you first?" he said, pulling my body towards him so his cock was close to my pussy.</p> <p>"Please," I moaned as he pushed inside of me, hitting my clit and sliding into my pussy easily. It felt better than any other time we had done it, and the more my husband liked the way it made me feel, the better it felt.</p> <p>"Yeah," he said, taking his cock out after a minute or so, sliding up andâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
