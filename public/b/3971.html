"You look just incredible!" "Better than incredible." I said, moving behind her.</p> <p>Her panties lay half to the floor, and the cheeks of her ass rested on my cock, which was nestled between them. It rubbed up and down the length of her crack as she moved. It was slick with saliva and pussy juice and the head was still shiny with her wetness.</p> <p>"How'd you like to play with my ass, too? Do you think it would hurt a little?" she asked, not hesitating or really bothering. "After all, it's the first time I've been fucked there."</p> <p>I moved up and kissed her neck. "I think you did too."</p> <p>Her mouth nibbled my ear, and she murmured, "My ass. It's been a long time, and I missed it. You were right-I can't believe I'm giving up my ass to you. But, I sure do like the way you put your fingers in me," she murmured, before lowering back down to take my cock back in her hand.</p> <p>I turned her so that she could suck on my left nipple while I fondled her right. The hand with which fingers penetrated her pussy moved down to her clit. She moaned around my nipple in response, and I pinched and rubbed her other nipple, causing her to whimper in pleasure, then look up at me with sparkling eyes.</p> <p>I moved back to her and, now sliding my fingers inside her pussy, I could feel her hot juices seeping onto my shaft before they got slick against her clit. I rubbed my fingers in tiny circles around her spot, bringing out the pink spots with each pass through her opening, and she gasped at my touch. We had been doing that for weeks, and she had no idea that she was ready to take me, even with my fingers still moving over her clit. Just the idea of it, if it was possible, caused her to squirm on top of me, her body moving back and forth, and she had to hold onto the bed, trying to keep from being thrown off of me.</p> <p>"I'm so close," she moaned as she started to cum. "Go slow or stop. Please."</p> <p>With one last kiss, she sat up and smiled at me and said "My turn..."</p> <p>*</p> <p>This one's for you, lovebirds. I hope you enjoyed it. And please comment as you think. Let me know what you think - I already write the next story, but that may not come as quickly or in style. Just like the preceding one, I've decided it's time to push things a little farther, but it was worth it - hopefully.
