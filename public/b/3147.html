"Your daddy and I went down the beach that first weekend. When we got there he was wearing a t-shirt and shorts and I couldn't miss noticing his big bulge. At first I thought it was because he was having a hard time getting the sun going again and he was looking over his shoulder like it was all the other people in the world."</p> <p>She had a pretty good point. The more I knew about my father, the more I realized the effect she had had on him. I looked a little more closely; it was a little dark, but I could definitely tell it wasn't dark tan, even in the nude. I didn't have an erection at all the next day anyway. I just assumed she had a boyfriend.</p> <p>"She told me what she did next for me. He and Dad were gone about a month then they came back out. It was all they could do but not fuck. Mom made sure everything was okay. She's a great sister and her sister's been here a lot. Not as much as Daddy," she added. I could hear a sad little grin coming over her face. She gave me a little pat on my shoulder.</p> <p>"Thanks," I said, trying to lighten the mood. "What do you think of her? Are you still jealous?"</p> <p>"Of course I am!" she said. "It's just that you know I'm a very nice guy and that I'd do anything for you. I'm really, really flattered. But my sister and I love each other. You are such a great guy," she said with a sigh. "Besides I think Mom makes a good impression on my Mom."</p> <p>"I am glad she was good for you," I said. "That's great." The smile disappeared from Kelly's face.</p> <p>"Mom said she made a great impression on me too. She told me how nice the beach was and how much I enjoyed swimming with you." "And how would you like to swim with me?" I asked with one eyebrow arched.</p> <p>"I'd love it," she said with a smile.</p> <p>"Good! I've always been attracted to alligators, but you're an exotic species," I said with a grin.</p> <p>She laughed, but then began to look at the sun. "Is it really that hot?"</p> <p>"It's beautiful in California, but a little cold, too," I offered. "I don't think Dad has seen any scenery in years." She gave me a wan smile.</p> <p>"Well, he doesn't get to see much either," she giggled. I smiled back. "Come on, let me get a cold one." We headed over, I handed her a bottle of water and she got a beer.</p> <p>"That's cold!" I said. I hadn't been kidding, but I was more than a little worried about it anyway. Kelly was probably more than capable of freezing it in a minute or two. She giggled and looked at me.</p> <p>"Do you want me to keep your temperature down?" she asked. I took a sip of my water and then looked at her. "Don't worry, you can get a lot warmer." I smiled and held out my free arm. This was getting a little awkward and I was having trouble keeping my head together.</p> <p>"I don't think my clothes would be able to cover this," I said as I reached over to shake her hand. I could see the look on her face.</p> <p>"Here, you can put my clothes back on!" she said as she threw her arms around my neck. I grinned and hugged her back.</p> <p>"You'll never guess," I said. There was no one in the room but us. She took a chance and slid one hand behind my head. I took the chance of holding her against me, we made sure of everything, except hers.</p> <p>"Do we need to swim to cool off a little?" she asked.</p> <p>"The water's a bit cold, but we should probably go," I said. After making sure she could put my clothes inside the tank, I went down into the house to grab our swim suits.</p> <p>"We're having guests tomorrow night?" my little sister asked as we walked back to the house. She was looking at the door as we walked. She turned her head and kissed my cheek. "What?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'm sorry. They're going to be all over their swimming friends tomorrow," she said, her blue eyes flashing at me with such beautiful lust. She was smiling widely and I could feel my heart racing. Did she know I had a crush on her? Damn it, she had probably noticedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
