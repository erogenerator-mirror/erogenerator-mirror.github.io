"Don't take too long, I'll catch up and we'll be on our way."</p> <p>I turned and walked back to the hotel, holding both Jack and Todd's hand tightly in mine. I felt a little more of my hair go straight down my back, and the shirt fell to cover just the very bottom two and a half of my back. I walked over to the elevator and let the doors close, then climbed in and waited.</p> <p>I sat looking out the window in this dark room and for a long time, before I could even think about it a man walked in, and I thought I was going to pass out for a long time.</p> <p>"You still here?" he asked, looking up at me.</p> <p>I nodded my head to him, "Yeah."</p> <p>He smiled down at me, "Well, I was wondering if you'd still like to stay a while longer" I said. My face was still a little red, but a little better, but I had a feeling I'd never gotten to sleep much.</p> <p>Suddenly, like on that first encounter, his hand tightened around mine, pulling me closer into his embrace. I felt so safe and loved, and I liked his scent, it was very nice and familiar. I didn't feel so drunk it would have made me a little light-headed, but there were other smells too, one from him and another from him. As he held me so tight, one foot on my other knee and one on my waist, I felt every sense in my body, one spot in between, on, and on it.</p> <p>He pulled me closer into him, my breasts pressing against his chest. His lips were soft and warm, and I could feel his strong jaw against my neck. In response to this, his tongue made one long slow lick at my nipple, and I felt myself go weak beneath his touch. I moaned, which pleased him also.</p> <p>I was still thinking about what it would be like to be held in a dark room, the very same room that had been me all this time, where I could be myself and have his body, and his touch, both, if he wanted to. I didn't need to think of any of it that night.</p> <p>"It's a real pleasure to meet you." He murmured as he looked me in the eyes. I could feel the moisture of his eyes, he wasn't smiling, but he didn't look like he was trying to hide anything either, in fact he was being kind of nervous, like I was still thinking about that.</p> <p>He pulled me even tighter, and his hands slipped down to find the hem of my shirt, lifting it off over my head. Underneath I was so small and frail, but he took his time with my neck, his hands, his arms. At first not trying to caress my body, but I knew he wanted me, needed me, and I let me hands do the rest, slipping one hand up his stomach to cup and gently squeeze on his cheek. He was so soft and fragile, and I loved his softness. I moved my hand up slowly, then stopped there.</p> <p>I could feel wetness at the juncture between my legs, and his lips captured mine, holding me just that tiny bit longer. I felt him slowly slide his lips lower until his tongue touched me just above my nipple. I breathed in, as he lowered his head, my head fell back against him and I moaned.</p> <p>He sucked, then bit, then kissed, and eventually ran his tongue down my stomach, just past the shirt on my skirt. This left him just above the hem, and I moved my hips, trying to rub myself against him. He lifted his head, "No, no."</p> <p>I lifted my head and looked him in the eyes again, "I'm not a little girl who's just going to have to put up with whatever you want to do to me, I'm not... You don't have to put up with anything," I said. "I love it, I really do. And if that was the only thing you wanted to do to me that night, then..." I paused to watch his expression as he moved his head back to look down at me. My eyes searched his, "What?" I felt a little confused.</p> <p>He looked at me, "What's this?"</p> <p>"It's my last name for here." I smiled at him, "I just have a last name. This is my last name. But it doesn't mean that I'm interested in you," I said, a bit scaredâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
