"You could be right. I didn't know this would happen."</p> <p>My own words were in my head, as memories of this morning raced back in.</p> <p>"I'll make it my birthday again..."</p> <p>"And I get to go to your birthday?"</p> <p>I nodded, then said in a slightly breathless voice: "So," and added hurriedly: "You guys have fun tonight?"</p> <p>He nodded seriously and added:</p> <p>"You could join the group."</p> <p>I grinned, then said softly: "You could be my man."</p> <p>He grinned in reply as he nodded and added: "I'd love to be your man. I don't want to do anything else with anybody other than you, and you're definitely a pretty sexy girl."</p> <p>Then he held out his hand to help me up, and I could feel his firmness, as it was again beginning to grow. He shook it as he said softly:</p> <p>"We really do have a lot of catching up to do today if we don't take it slow."</p> <p>I nodded and kissed him. I felt it again at my lips but didn't care - I had to get back to work - and then he was pulling me up and towards him, and with his left hand he gently cupped my right breast through my blouse. There we stood together by ourselves, feeling the warmth and hardness of his manhood against my stomach as it grew to full erection. Then, just the feel of his chest moving against me was enough to satisfy me - and he did that just before reaching down to tug at the elastic of my skirt. As I tried not to protest, he pulled back and looked expectantly at me, smiling and saying:</p> <p>"You're wearing this, honey."</p> <p>He leaned down and kissed me again, and he was obviously ready for me and the way my skirt had slipped off, and soon he was holding the blouse up and I stood naked in front of him. He was obviously in a hurry and needed to be ready as soon as he could, as if I had said:</p> <p>"I think he's in his office, waiting for you to come in."</p> <p>I smiled and kissed him again, and felt that tingle in my belly again and he took my left hand and guided it to his belt. Then he stood me up against his desk and pulled me close, taking my hand and guiding it down his pants and inside. He held his right hand out and I brought it to his mouth then took his finger and opened it up for him, licking its wetness - my pussy juice - off his finger as he kissed me again, then drew his mouth to my neck and licked up and down and then licked his way to my breasts again. He kissed and licked and sucked at them, and his dick was already growing. I looked at him, with a look of desperation.</p> <p>"What about you? Are you okay with this, hon?"</p> <p>He grinned and said softly:</p> <p>"I like everything we have done so far. I think it would help us to be a good couple, if we don't just go crazy."</p> <p>He got straight to the point, and I just could see his erection throb at my hand.</p> <p>"You know you're not just going to have to get me to suck you," he added.</p> <p>I nodded, and smiled and asked him:</p> <p>"You sure you're okay?"</p> <p>He nodded and grinned again, saying:</p> <p>"I'm better than okay. I promise."</p> <p>He kissed me, and lifted me so that I was straddling his leg, then said softly:</p> <p>"Let me have some room."</p> <p>I just smiled and nodded, then watched as he pulled off the shirt. By then his body felt ready for me and I felt the heat of his body with my fingers as they ran over his cock. He was already up to the task in his office but his dick was still growing and was standing proudly, so I didn't need to guide it inside. I looked at his hand, and I'd hardly seen his finger.</p> <p>As I took his left hand, he put my right nipple between his fingers and squeezed it gently, and then held the left one, and he bent down and kissed the other one as he gently moved his hand over mine and his. Then he pulled it slowly towards him. As it neared my pussy, his hand rubbed the side of my breast gently, then he moved his whole hand. I felt the heat of it through both of usâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
