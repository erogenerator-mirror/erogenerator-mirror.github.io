Then she leaned forward a little and kissed me lightly on the cheek, and turned to go.</p> <p>Later that night I snuggled up against her, rubbing against her leg ever so lightly.</p> <p>"I've still got a long way to go before I can be completely alone." she said softly in my ear, and with that I rolled onto my side.</p> <p>I could feel the warmth of her body against my leg and I was already about to fall asleep when she got up from the night stand and grabbed my hand again.</p> <p>"Come on, let's go get something to eat." she said and we headed out of the bathroom toward the bedroom.</p> <p>When we found the kitchen she made up something and we sat at the island in the middle of the table. I took a bite of my cheesecake and looked across at her.</p> <p>"I'm sure you're dying to tell me how much you have in your little pocket."</p> <p>"You don't need to remind me that, it looks great," she said running her fingers through her hair with a smile on her face. I didn't say a word, just enjoyed her company as we ate our cheesecake. I was starting to really enjoy her company. We finished off our chocolate cake with cream, strawberries and a small bowl of whipped cream.</p> <p>"Ok, what would you like to do today?" I asked her hopefully.</p> <p>"Well, I've been meaning to tell you but I've been thinking or going crazy lately." she said looking at me and starting to smile.</p> <p>"I see.</p> <p>So what are you really thinking right now?"</p> <p>"I'm not a little girl anymore." she said with a smile and threw the hair at me.</p> <p>"A little girl.</p> <p>So when are we going to spend the rest of our lives together?" I asked back with that same smile back.</p> <p>"That sounds like a good plan." she admitted, "it will be only for a little while."</p> <p>And then we started kissing again as I pulled her closer. She started to moan quietly as we continued to kiss. My mind started to get a little foggy, it was kind of like getting up in the middle of the day and all it seemed to be getting was a little slower. It was beginning to get dark and it wasn't long before her hands were all over my body.</p> <p>"Damn babe, how did you know how to use that thing?" I asked as she pulled at my shirt.</p> <p>"I think you were the first thing that ever said what it was I needed." she said with a smile, "I'm sure some other man would have been happy to come in his pants."</p> <p>"Well, I don't need to. But I'd like to do some exploring with it for you."</p> <p>"You mean to come in my pussy?" she asked and she started to reach inside of me to take a finger from the bowl on the counter.</p> <p>I smiled at her and pushed her fingers into my mouth, licking the last of her juices from them. She reached below me and grabbed my cock, pulling it up hard. She brought me to her mouth and sucked on my head, getting me wet before she moved me back and up to the tip.</p> <p>"See something you like?" I said to her and she just nodded.</p> <p>"Are you ready to get inside of me?" I asked her as I reached down and grabbed the little pink jewel holding her hair.</p> <p>She moved down the bed while I held her head in place and guided her slowly down. I felt the slickness of her pussy as she sank down all the way and was in a moment.</p> <p>Her hand reached out and started to gently rub at my balls while I started to kiss her hard at the same time. I could hear her moaning as she took me in all the way.</p> <p>"I feel how good you are in me babe...so tight and warm. I can feel you in my belly, all down there. That feels soo good!" she whispered to me as she took me out and started to run her tongue along the base of it.</p> <p>I could feel a small orgasm building and wanted to move on in case I got an invitation to join in at that point.</p> <p>"That's so nice, babe. Keep going." I moaned as she grabbed my hair and pulled me up to her.</p> <p>"Are you sure, you feel different than I do?" she asked me with a soft voice.</p> <p>"Mmm hmm" was my replyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
