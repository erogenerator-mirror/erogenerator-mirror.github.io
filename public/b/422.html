As we stepped out onto my platform I looked out at the street. It was as I had imagined: a gorgeous sunny day with a glorious view of the city. As we headed toward it we felt the city’s vibrancy fill our senses for a brief moment. I saw something, and a figure behind me. It took me a few seconds before I focused on the face of the blonde woman I had seen in the elevator before.</p> <p>Looking at her I saw that she was the blonde woman I had just left with the story of the story. It was the first time I had ever seen a woman with long hair. I just shook my head; the idea of a blonde woman that I had never even noticed before in my wildest imaginings had never even crossed my mind.</p> <p>As we passed her the elevator continued on, taking us inside a building she pulled me toward her. She pressed the lock button and opened the door. We stepped inside, the lights glowed off, and the room was dark except for the one light that came from across the room. Suddenly the light changed to a soft blue-green light from behind her that illuminated the room like a second light. There was a moment of silence, and then the woman inside her opened her eyes, but only for a second.</p> <p>The room was a complete change from where I had left it. There were windows from the inside and above, but no windows directly overhead. This time I could only see the distance between where she was standing and where the light started coming on. The two women in front were the same height, but the two figures were now closer to us. All the lights were dim. The first thing that struck me as totally odd was that there was no glow to match the bright light behind them.</p> <p>The blond woman from earlier had stood with her hands on her hips, looking directly at me. She began to laugh and wave at the same time and I could see that the laughter was also coming from her partner, but he too was looking directly at me. Her partner spoke first, which caught me by surprise. I could tell that he had been looking straight into my face as he spoke.</p> <p>“Hey, I was just about to tell you the story of the story of the story of the day,” he said, and I watched as his eyes moved from his feet up to meet mine. When they left mine, they moved up, resting on the arms of his partner's. I could see the expression of a smile on his face.</p> <p>He looked me in the eyes again, and then took both of his hands out of his pants.</p> <p>“See?” He asked.</p> <p>“Yeah, I guess I do.”</p> <p>With that, he reached over and took my hand, leading me to the second level. I could hear the sounds of jazz and soft-drum music coming from somewhere just behind us. I listened as he brought me up to the first floor, looking around. The carpet was soft and carpeted.</p> <p>She was still standing there, still holding onto him, as she took off her coat, pulling him into the room. The three of us entered and he led me to the corner of the first floor. I realized that they were actually going to make love there. I looked around at the room. The décor was everything I had imagined; candlelight, romantic music, and lush lighting. There was something about this room that was really sexy. I liked it.</p> <p>He stopped me in front of a doorway and opened the door, and as I turned to look at him, he took me in his arms and kissed me. I was instantly aware of his soft, warm lips and a light caress along the curve of my neck. I closed my eyes and tilted my head back, as I felt him slip more of himself in to me. He kissed me harder, as he did that. I turned away and pushed him away, which surprised him once again. Still feeling the warmth of his body inside of mine, he stood up, and reached down, taking my hands.</p> <p>“Come on, my lover,” he started, then—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
