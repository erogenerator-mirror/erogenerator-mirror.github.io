"It makes us even hotter."</p> <p>"And it makes us even closer friends too."</p> <p>"Yeah, yeah."</p> <p>"So... What would you like to do, right now?"</p> <p>"Now you have me all set."</p> <p>"Let's do it now," he took another drink and put on his plate to take and eat, "Here, sit up there on the sofa and put your feet in the stirrups."</p> <p>"How do I do that?"</p> <p>"You need to get up a little. Put your skirt on the floor. I'll tie the straps. You can take your top off." He set his glass on the floor, "We could go do this in private."</p> <p>"Let me lay face down with my bare bottom over the end of the sofa?"</p> <p>He didn't even wait a second, "Why don't you hop up on that sofa and lie on your back."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>He started to get up from the sofa. "Here, get back over here and lie on your belly." She sat in the armchair and took off her skirt. "You know."</p> <p>"How...," he reached back and untied her bra as she was reaching for her top and slipped the straps off. Her breasts were heaving back and forth to try and get some air. He was getting a lot more interested in her breasts and the way her nipples stood even straighter from her excitement. He put his arms under her as she lay flat on the leather sofa, "I knew you were built for a man to be inside you, weren't you?"</p> <p>"We are going to try the things that we have read about, but I don't think we should start just yet."</p> <p>"Okay" he reached over from behind her to the bag she had thrown away on the coffee table. He fished out what she had picked up from the bathroom. He had made them a lot of money. One day he would have made them an even bigger fortune if the girl had been like this. Now, two women and three men.</p> <p>"These are a couple of things you've already done for me. This would be a lot of fun if I let you try them, but they would be great if I did what you have been doing for you all these months thinking I wasn't a girl."</p> <p>"I'm still not convinced you're a girl."</p> <p>"Just a little better than a girl you've been with."</p> <p>He put on the two of them.</p> <p>He leaned down and kissed her neck.</p> <p>"Mmm, we can do another one."</p> <p>"What's so much fun in a little bit? I'm still not sure how much we can get you all to myself, I think two would feel much better."</p> <p>"Mmm, we can try."</p> <p>She had opened the robe she had picked up from the bathroom, "Okay," his fingers slipped inside it from behind. It was a warm wet sensation as he touched her from behind, "You have great tits. You'd probably like to suck on them again?"</p> <p>"I did something that first day I met you that was a first for me."</p> <p>He cupped them and squeezed them, "I like to kiss them and fondle them, but do you see if you can make me cum with your nipples?"</p> <p>"That's it. It feels so good there."</p> <p>"But before we start... Can you make me cum?"</p> <p>"I don't know, if you feel good enough... We'll work on your body, just have to make sure it works for us. We were going to have a little discussion that we needed to discuss."</p> <p>"How do we make it work?"</p> <p>He turned around in time to see her put her panties and bra back on and he pulled out his own top and laid it across the coffee table. "Put these under you on."</p> <p>She put her panties on and he tied the waistband on each side of her hips and pulled her thong up around her hips.</p> <p>"So, just try to keep us from doing things that will get us started in our own world."</p> <p>"There's one thing," she reached around under the table and put her hands on his shoulders. "Mmm, my tits are aching a bit from all that work you did, we better just get comfortable without having a lot of people watchingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
