I want you. It's time."</p> <p>I got out of the car just after she started it and was quickly out the door and on my way. I reached my apartment and found her waiting for me on my front step. I handed her the keys and she grabbed her keys.</p> <p>"You don't have to go any further with me," she said. "We can find a way out of this."</p> <p>I shrugged and turned around then started toward my apartment. I looked around and wondered where all the other guys were hanging out. There would be a lot of people there if they were as horny as I was. I wondered if I could get her to do something with me. I couldn't. Not in front of a whole lot of people. I wanted more than that.</p> <p>"I don't want to go into this," I said. "This is way more than sex. I'm really pissed off. Let's just go."</p> <p>I walked into the bedroom on my two seater couch and sat down. I looked around until everything looked normal and then opened the laptop for the video game I was in the process of doing. I had a game that I was working on on my laptop for the week. I turned it on and tried to watch the game. I put all the video I was seeing and all of my videos and when I finished I realized I had stopped looking at the video again; I sat the video on the laptop and looked around the room again. It wasn't the first time I had looked at something different.</p> <p>I stood up and walked across my living room toward the bedroom. I heard music coming from under the windows. I stopped and looked out the window at the street on the opposite side of town. It was just a small neighborhood on the other side of town. I looked at the street again and noticed that if anyone followed on my street, they would never be able to see.</p> <p>I walked out the front doors of my local community to the street for a walk. It's not far, but I didn't think the people could get away with getting in trouble, so I walked as fast as I could. I noticed that a nice looking couple was walking in front of me on the street next to mine. I stopped, turned to face them and started walking back toward my apartment building. By the time I got there they were both in the front seat and the guy had his right arm around her.</p> <p>I looked up and saw that the guy's left hand was on the small of her bare back while her hand was on the guy's thigh. That was definitely too far for her to do what she wanted to do, but it did give me some of a view of her ass. I could see the outline of her dark panties through the thin material of the man's pants. The man was looking more than the view of her breasts, so I knew this was just going to be a little extra.</p> <p>I walked by, and again noticed the guys' hand on her left shoulder. I watched as they looked at each other.</p> <p>When I got back to my apartment I realized that I had been too horny to notice how much the guy's hand felt on her back. I was going to have to do something about it. I got all the stuff out of my apartment and put it on the kitchen table. I went into my bedroom and pulled out my video game and waited for my parents to come home and get me home.</p> <p>A couple of minutes later they arrived home. They were dressed in similar outfits from their own day. I told them to sit on the stairs, but I told them to put on their underwear. They did as told. When they arrived upstairs, I explained that it was my dad and mom's problem. It would be fine with them if I just let them just go take a shower. I could use the extra towel and water.</p> <p>My mother and dad came downstairs, and the two men sat and ate. They stopped just before they got up to go and mom said, "You're parents are not allowed to see each other like this."</p> <p>"We wouldn't be able to tell them what we're doing. We'll tell them right here," my dad said. He turned her around just as she was giving them a blowjob. This was so embarrassing and I wished they would just leave. I wanted to get angry and run them off. But instead I felt that there was more to this humiliation right now. "Come out here, go on your knees," I yelled at them as I pulled her up.</p> <p>"Are you sure that is where we want to be?" my mother asked.</p> <p>"Look," I said to my dad, "There is nothing we can do to stop you now."</p> <p>"Okay," the other guy said.
