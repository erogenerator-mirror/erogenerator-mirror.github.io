I nodded. "I've been wanting it for days." he said as he slid off me, and got on the bed between my legs. He slid in easily and we started fucking again. I don't think I've ever been fucked that long or hard in my whole life right on my feet. He fucked me a good five minutes before he tensed up and came again. I felt the warmth of his seed fill me and the contractions it caused. He fell onto me and we were both exhausted.</p> <p>"My God," I finally told him. "That was incredible." I said after a moment to him. "I don't feel that way for anyone else after that."</p> <p>He laughed lightly and then kissed the back of my neck. "I'm glad you enjoyed the experience. It's been a long time." He said and then rolled off me. He pulled a clean towel from the nightstand and cleaned himself off as he got up, and got dressed.</p> <p>* * * * * *</p> <p>The next one I saw was a little before dinner time. I was shocked. The woman sitting in the middle of the family room seemed to be dressed in a white blouse and matching skirt. She looked so hot. I couldn't help smiling. She smiled at that.</p> <p>She saw me staring and asked, "Is that a girl or a boy?"</p> <p>I blushed and shook my head. "A boy. He got to bed with me a short time ago." and I held out the empty plate. "It's not that I want to be alone. I just need to sit and watch and listen for a while." I offered, but she just waved my hand dismissively.</p> <p>We waited at the table and talked about different things from family to their school, hobbies to school to hobbies and hobbies to life to things like that. After dinner the women got up and left. I noticed the look on the woman's face as she walked out of the room. I heard the doors close as she strode by. She stopped at the table and smiled at me. I think the expression on her face was like one of surprise.</p> <p>"What's with you?" she asked me after the table was cleared. I could tell it was something that she had put down on the phone, but I didn't catch it.</p> <p>I smiled at her. "I'm your son in law." I started. "My wife died and I was so excited she left me a checkbook. Just like the girls at the diner did to their credit cards." I leaned forward and said gently, "If anything happened to your wife, you could be dead in two weeks."</p> <p>She was silent for a few seconds, then smiled. "If that happens, there won't be anybody else there. I know it's been a while and I miss my wife. But when I see her there, everything is perfect. If that doesn't happen, she's going to see someone she knows. She doesn't mind if I get caught up to be with my brother in law."</p> <p>I just smiled. "If she catches you, she'd understand and would get back to me. I don't want her to lose a thing either. Besides if she's a deadbeat, it doesn't matter.</p> <p>"Mom, you've seen dad. Dad is the best man they have. He has a great job, is dependable and has a nice house for your kids to live up in. I just think it would be nice to have a man that works with him. He just made sure you were having a good time, so you wouldn't get sick." I said as I looked at her, who smiled.</p> <p>"He never would have picked that one." she said in a small voice. "You don't get to pick who would take care of you while dad's there. It's always better just for his job." I said.</p> <p>She laughed and pulled herself into the corner of the chair and sat back down, resting her feet on my lap. "I don't think I could handle that son of a bitch." She said in a hushed voice as she reached for my hand.</p> <p>I smiled knowingly and said, "You think it's just a one night stand do you?" I squeezed her hand and then leaned in again. "I've been around enough." I laughed lightly.</p> <p>The next day we went into the kitchen and I helped her into the hot water for dinner. I washed her dishes and we cooked together. She loved to cook and cleaned up after myself and she showed me just what I could do. When we got out to the pool she had a new dress on. That one was different. It was a bright yellow, and I had tried to visualize her in a skirtâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
