A private performance to show off the girl’s body, and to impress your peers.”</p> <p>“I don’t understand.”</p> <p>“Well, we do have an arrangement, now you know how.”</p> <p>“But she doesn’t even look like a man.”</p> <p>“And you think she's a woman?”</p> <p>“Well, she’s a man. She’s a transsexual woman.”</p> <p>“And she’s not into men at all.”</p> <p>He started to laugh. “Well it’s a big step on her side, she was quite into dressing up a little. But she’s a transsexual and we’re both women.”</p> <p>“That’s right. I guess there was a time when she was actually gay.”</p> <p>“But if I had a guy, would you do it?”</p> <p>“Yes, I do. But if it was some big business, I would not be able to go that far.”</p> <p>“Don’t you worry, you’ll have fun, sweetheart,” and as soon as she said it she was right there. She straddled him, sitting on his thigh. Leaning forward he cupped her face in his hands, her eyes widened. She placed her hands on his shoulders and he pulled her onto him. She felt his erection pressing against her hip, which was now just inches from her pussy. She reached down and grasped his rigid member. She rubbed the tip back and forth along her lips. He moaned softly.</p> <p>“You have such a beautiful pussy, baby. I’m going to worship it.”</p> <p>“I love you being so forceful with me. But let me take care of that first,” but she didn’t have time for teasing. She leaned forward, her lips brushing against his. His hands reached out and caressed her breasts, playing with her nipples as she rubbed her pubis against his. She let out a low moan as the tip of his long cock pushed into her pussy. She felt it spreading her lips. She pressed her pelvis against him as she felt him penetrate her. One of his hands moved to cup her bottom. His fingertips traced the curve of her cheek as the other pulled her into him. She pressed her tongue against his, their bodies moving at the same time. He let the tip of his cock push into her open labia.</p> <p>“That’s it, sweetheart,” and he started to withdraw. Her wet hole tightened around him as he did so. He pushed back into her, moving his cock in and out of her slowly. Every so often, she would pause from moving in rhythm to the thrust. She was moaning now as well, with the need of coming and so much joy in their coupling. She had never felt anyone fuck her so powerfully before. It felt so good. His cock was filling her completely now. She started to ride him again, taking his full length in her slippery tunnel of delight while their tongues explored each other’s mouths. Her eyes were closed, so she could barely see the expression on his face. She could feel his muscles tightening as he moved inside her. He pulled out and then he thrust deep into her, coming so close to her that she felt it hit her. She collapsed against him.</p> <p>The passion was back in the room now. The audience was watching them. Their hands were busy in their own private places, the faces between their legs were a delight. She started to walk slowly away. One of his legs shifted around behind her. She knew it was him and she stopped. They stayed like that. She leaned forward and kissed him again, as his hand moved behind her to her bottom. Now her hips were moving with him, moving against him. Her nipples were like bullets as she teased him with gentle kisses all across his face. She held him, and kissed him all over. She started to rise again, to leave his member behind. He placed a single finger in her mouth, making her suck it.</p> <p>“Please baby, stop, I need to cum.”</p> <p>“Please. I can’t.”</p> <p>“I said I can’t.”</p> <p>“Okay,” she said then, as the tip of his cock—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
