I'm not all that long but I'm not overweight either but I'm not a beauty queen. I'm slender 5' 8", and I've got long straight blond hair, blue eyes, an hourglass figure with an ass to die for.</p> <p>We met a little under 5 minutes late after we had started. At first it wasn't me but soon we got to know each other, we talked the night before and agreed to meet at a club the next weekend.</p> <p>"You can't be that late, my room mates are at a friend's house, they'll be asleep or something." He warned me.</p> <p>He was about 6'2, and had a good body and an outgoing personality with no bullshit. There was no way he was not going to be at my apartment any sooner. This was a guy who I knew was in the dark.</p> <p>At the door I rang the bell and within a minute he opened the door and invited me in.</p> <p>I was instantly drawn to him instantly, I could hardly believe this was happening. It was as though he knew it was possible to fall in love, and he could do this to me so easily.</p> <p>He walked me in, turned and said, "How the night was out" his eyes dropped to my chest, "What do you think is in my pants?"</p> <p>I was speechless, my mind raced back for a moment trying to comprehend what was here to be said.</p> <p>"What did you want to know?"</p> <p>"How would I like to start?" was his simple reply. His hands started to work, slowly caressing my upper arms and back.</p> <p>"That is so nice" I said, my voice was shaking with emotion.</p> <p>"How would you like to start? You do remember that I promised you a date." He asked. I nodded my head. He slowly turned me towards him, and began to run his hands down my neck and chest. He slowly put his palms in my cleavage and up over my breasts. He gave me a hard kiss on my mouth, our tongues danced in each others' tasting. He ran his hands round my back while pulling me closer to him. He cupped each one in his hands and began to lightly tease my nipples, making them rock hard between his fingers.</p> <p>"Ohhhhhhhhhh, please" I was moaning, my head is rolling in the back of my head, he pulled me towards him by my shoulders and gently turned me around, as he pushed me towards the bed and undid his pants. I just could not believe what was happening this was so hot and happening so fast.</p> <p>He pushed me to the bed and began to strip me before taking my shirt and pants off. He sat me down on the bed and started to remove my panties. He was slowly taking his time making the most of it, he pulled apart my legs giving me a moment to feel his hot tongue first licking my mound. As he made his way down my body he slowly opened my legs and got to my knees and took his face and started to slide his tongue up and down my slit.</p> <p>I was feeling so good I could hardly control my body, it was a long time coming but I was already on the verge. I was in a fever already I was lost in a world of his mouth and tongue.</p> <p>He started to suck my clit, sending me into sexual bliss all at once. His tongue felt soooo good, it felt like magic as he kept on with his tongue, I was in heaven. As I calmed my body down he stood up and took his pants off, and with another movement of his hands he threw me lying on the bed.</p> <p>He grabbed me by the legs and pulled me closer, my head was back and my eyes were closed and I was moaning in a lust filled tone as he slowly positioned himself. He slowly pushed his length in me, taking a few thrusts into me, not wasting time, making me tense up before slowly thrusting it all the way in my body.</p> <p>He kept it moving in me all the time, I could feel my body moving and squeezing the whole time, I could feel my breasts, my stomach, my thighs and my ass. He then started to thrust faster, deeper and harder until both of us were panting heavily in an attempt to keep up. As he started to explode deep inside me, he held me close with each thrust, so that we fell on the ground underneath my body, I could feel his warmth on me as he slowly got off me.</p> <p>We lay on the bed, exhausted.</p> <p>"Your next, I want your ass to be nice and ready while I get my own bed ready."</p> <p>Without any further ado he rolled me off him and quickly tore off his clothes, my eyes opened wideâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
