He grabbed her hips, pressing himself inside her body.</p> <p>"Yeah," she said. "Go for it!"</p> <p>He began to fuck her faster and harder. He was breathing harder now, but he tried not to cum. Just when she thought he couldn't handle another minute of this, he did get off her, too.</p> <p>She leaned forward, pressing her body against him. Their kiss went on, a deep, passionate, soulful kiss. Neither of them wanted a moment more.</p> <p>It was the third person to go home with, and as he watched his girlfriend sucking hungrily on his cock to her climax, he knew it was time for him too. He let her go.</p> <p>"Take me home," he said, his voice sounding like his guttural voice.</p> <p>"What?" she exclaimed, surprised and surprised. "You're staying. Oh, no, that's okay, I already have some money."</p> <p>"Right in that." He stepped aside, holding the door open for her. "Come on in, too."</p> <p>The house was empty. The man got in the car behind it, turning around once he got in the passenger side. She followed him, getting into the driver side. As they drove away from the car, she turned on his radio to get some music playing from the stereo.</p> <p>They were at the door to the house, at last able to talk at last.</p> <p>"I have something I need to do, now. And you do too; I'm a little busy, too, but I have lots of free time to do it. I've been thinking of you all day."</p> <p>"I missed being with you that way, too."</p> <p>"I missed being with you that way, too." They pulled into the driveway, which was as dark as the one they had just left.</p> <p>"Where did you want to be gone from?" he asked.</p> <p>"I told my parents I was taking the bus to work and they agreed that I'd need to stay here if I was going to be all right. I'm glad they're all good with me there."</p> <p>"I guess I got the point, too. My parents have got all kinds of bad thoughts about me, don't they?"</p> <p>"There were times, really, that one mother said they ought to take me up on it. Well, I'm here."</p> <p>"Oh, that's so sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet. You're the first person they've forgiven me for having a boyfriend."</p> <p>"Well, thank you," she said, laughing. "I'm glad they know I'm so devoted to you, but we're friends now. They're not gonna let that go unchangably."</p> <p>"It was nice being friends with a boy," he said, leaning back and looking into the face of her. "But I still have a lot to do."</p> <p>They kissed before entering the house.</p> <p>"Do you like Italian?" he asked.</p> <p>"I really like it and, yes, I do love Italian."</p> <p>"Is it as bad as you think it should be?"</p> <p>"There's no such thing as bad as bad. If you like it, don't stop kissing it! If I don't like it, just go crazy. I don't have to go crazy, just go crazy!"</p> <p>For some unexplainable reason, all the women he had met since he knew her would love to fuck him right then. So he kissed her, too—and she started kissing him back. This was what he had been looking for and had been hoping to experience for himself.</p> <p>His hands came up to feel her breasts as she lay with him on the sofa, his legs between hers, their legs overlapping, his cock buried in her pussy. But she moved them away. In fact, he pulled back, as though she was making him uncomfortable.</p> <p>"I want to tell you this," she murmured, her hand moving between his legs, caressing their cocks. "You better not just go crazy on me like that! I want to feel you inside of me! I want to feel you in me!"</p> <p>She slid her hand up and down on his cock, using her free hand to spread herself so that one hand was on the cushion, the other one on the arm of the sofa, while she felt around.</p> <p>She found that the head of the black cock was swollen and fully erect. She could feel it pulsing against her palm. She was actually starting to get wet, a fact that she had noticed before when she had come in to the house.</p> <p>She looked down at him, smiling at him sweetly as she continued.</p> <p>"This—this big black cock—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
