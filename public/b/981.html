I began sucking her right breast, and my left slowly brought my mouth to her left, teasing in her nipple with my tongue. She continued to lick and suck at my ear.</p> <p>“Mmm,” she said.</p> <p>I looked down at her. She had removed the rest of her clothes in a single motion, and was naked underneath; her dark, trimmed bush gleaming above her smooth body.</p> <p>I leaned down and put my hands under her ass, lifting and spreading her open until her pussy was exposed below it. The lips glistened wetly as her juices started running onto my fingers, wetting them.</p> <p>“Please,” she murmured. I smiled as I dipped my tongue into her wetness. I pulled her left leg slightly, then the right, and spread her open again.</p> <p>Her face was at the level of my dick, which was hanging limp at an angle right near my belly; I could see that my dick was glistening from her saliva and her pussy. As I lowered her to my waiting dick, her lips wrapped around it, sucking on the engorged head with her lips as she sucked. Her hands still held my dick tightly in the palm of one hand. I could feel my shaft in a fist. Her throat muscles tightened almost immediately around the head when my dick went all the way down. She sucked on the base and her tongue slid along the entire length of my shaft.</p> <p>She began humming in her throat, moaning with it, and I felt the vibrations of her humming on my dick. I continued to pleasure her with my lips and tongue. Her lips began to quiver even more as she came down onto my dick and I felt her pussy clamp down onto me. I pulled her up off of me and she lifted herself up.</p> <p>“I’m gonna make this a long time,” I murmured. We both laughed, and I pulled her face to mine and we made out again for about 10 minutes, her fingers teasing my pussy, pulling my legs apart, rubbing my clit and sliding into my anus. I’m still not sure how long we made out, but we were both panting, and I felt a flood of wetness from her pussy that flowed down on her fingers.</p> <p>We lay on the bed watching the TV once more, and she got up to wash her hands. I lay down beside her, spooning her, and we both drifted off to sleep.</p> <p>The next morning, her roommate came down to our room to collect her things from the house. The whole room was quiet. I heard her ask my name, and when I turned to look at her face, I saw a smile on her face. We kissed again, and she put her arms around me, pressing herself firmly against my naked body. She rolled her head to the left and looked into my eyes after taking a breath.</p> <p>“I’ve never been with a man like you;” she said quietly.</p> <p>I just grinned. “And it’s not the first time I’ve had a woman like you. What do you say we get to know each other better?”</p> <p>She laughed softly at that. “I could give you a lot more than you bargained for.” She laughed again. “This wouldn’t be more than just me, if you wanted my body too.”</p> <p>I felt my dick start to grow at the thought of her lying naked in bed with me. “Well, I’m glad for you,” I sighed.</p> <p>“Me too,” she replied.</p> <p>She leaned close to me and kissed my cheek.</p> <p>“You can be sure that if we ever do get together, I’m going to be with you, in every way that you can imagine.”</p> <p>“You sure do," I said. She leaned in again and ran her tongue down my chin. She turned away and pulled her shirt up and off. Her ass looked even better when she bent over to take the shoes off first. She leaned back and I could see she was still barefoot. I leaned back down and ran my hands under her ass and pulled her into my mouth. She gave out little moans of pleasure when my lips closed over her nipples.</p> <p>Her knees were bent and her legs were spread wide. I ran my hands along her inner thighs until I found the lips of her pussy, and gently stroked them through the thin cloth of her thong. She was already wet, and my hands slid easily in and out along the soft, wet lips. I pulled her down onto my—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
