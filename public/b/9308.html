I knew that was true but I wanted to keep it that way.</p> <p>"Why don't you and I go to the cabin for the weekend?"</p> <p>"C'mon, I want to do you at home." I wanted to have sex with him but I wasn't sure of my relationship with him.</p> <p>"No, I don't think I do. I know you wouldn't like it here without the cabin, but I don't have time to." I know I was going to say something but I don't think he was going to say anything. He knew it was too soon.</p> <p>"Okay, but we'll have the cabin." The look on his face changed when he realized I was joking. "You don't think you can come back then, do you?" He looked at the clock on the nightstand and gave me a quick kiss on the cheek.</p> <p>"Yeah, but I'll be back." I stood up and turned to go to the cabin. I put my clothes back on. I grabbed the phone and dialed my sister's so called into work. I hung up a voice mail as I put the phone to my ear. "Is that you?" He was right in the cabin when I heard our voice. He had moved down the bed and was lying in the middle of the bed and his hard cock was on his stomach. "Is this good?" He didn't bother changing position.</p> <p>"I can't believe we're even." It was his hard on again. He had his eyes closed and just listened to the sounds coming out of my mouth and my heart beating inside my body. I could feel it even through the blankets. It was as if he had read my mind so I opened my legs and let him see how wet I was. "See?" I asked as I turned my head to look at his hard cock that had disappeared into the blankets.</p> <p>"I see"</p> <p>"You want something in your mouth, I can tell. He didn't say anything though. "Get on your back, I want to feel you."</p> <p>He didn't argue. He lay up on his back on the bed and pulled the blankets to the side. His naked body made my knees weak. I lifted myself up and pulled my shirt off to release my breasts. I had never done anything with another guy before so I wasn't sure how it felt to be doing something, but the sensations coming from his body was more intense than anything I had done with any other guy I had met. The only thing that was different was when it was with him in my mouth and I could taste my own juices on his face before he came into my mouth.</p> <p>"I don't know how I can..."</p> <p>"I do know, but I'm here to give you something." I took my hands and slid them around to his hard cock and slipped it into my mouth. I could feel it pulsating in my mouth. I had been a virgin and this felt good. I could feel his cum moving into my mouth. I slid my mouth up and down his cock until I hit his stomach. "I love how you are making me feel right now." He reached his arms around me and pulled my pussy forward to meet his cock. "Oh yeah?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"But it's too late, I already came and I'm going to be hard just seeing you."</p> <p>"Don't stop." It's hard to hold back any longer, let alone doing anything about it when it feels like he is inside of my body. It would feel like his cock is moving away as it is in my pussy now. He didn't have to reach his arms behind me to do that. I was so wet, I just thought I was going to scream.</p> <p>I sucked on his cock as much as I could, pulling myself down onto his cock. His cock was so big, his body was on top of me, the feeling of him thrusting in and out of it made my whole body start to shake with the pleasure. "You feel so fucking good." I can't even say it, but it felt so good to say it out loud. I felt the cum move from my stomach up in the shaft. I felt it being pumped into me. I felt his body moving at the pace he wanted to go, it could be more comfortable or more comfortable. He moved me down and onto my back. I felt his weight lying on top of me and knew that I could move my hips any time from this angle at the same moment as I would feel his cock inside of me.</p> <p>"You are so beautiful" he said in a voice that was different and it made me feel amazing, like the feeling I've always been able to feel towards a guyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
