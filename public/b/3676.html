He says he wants my ass."</p> <p>I watched his ass walk down the stairs as I sat beside him. He seemed a little confused since he had never done that, I guess being a kid that way. I reached over and took his hand, giving it a squeeze as we walked down the stairs. As we got closer to the master, I felt his hand wrap around my hand. I glanced over as he stopped and looked at me, his face blanked with what seemed to be a confused look.</p> <p>"He likes to play with my ass," I said, and a nervous laugh escaped him. "He got me a dildo too, that's all."</p> <p>"You're such a naughty little girl, he's not going to do that is he?" I said to him, and his face lit up. I felt my lips part, just wanting to kiss him, kiss him the way that only brothers kiss and get off each other on. "Just do not tell him about tonight!"</p> <p>"Of course not," he replied, and I felt his hand slide up to my breast, squeezing it through the silk top.</p> <p>I looked over to the door and I could see he was looking back. "Are you coming?" I asked him, and he shook his head as I looked back. I felt him pull his hand away, and I looked back to the door before I walked around him. "Please, stop for a second, I'm coming!" I said to him, and we both laughed as he turned and started up the stairs.</p> <p>"Come on..." I said before I could get him to stop. I slowly walked around him, looking his ass over, noticing all the different colors of the skin, and I could smell the muskiness of his sex. I reached down and felt his ass, rubbing my hand over it.</p> <p>"Yes, just relax...." I said to him. He smiled at me, the corner of his mouth coming up to meet mine just a long moment too quickly. We broke out of our kiss, both of us smiling at the look of surprise and the look on his face.</p> <p>Just then, the doorbell went. I looked at Ron's, and saw him smile.</p> <p>"Come on in," he said to me. I could see his eyes light up as he entered.</p> <p>Inside the house I could hear him call the front desk, it startled me. "Please have a seat, I'll let you up."</p> <p>"Oh...ok," he answered then came back over and sat on the couch.</p> <p>"It's kind of cold in here," he told my.</p> <p>"It's been a few months heh," I remarked over my shoulder.</p> <p>"I hope you're not cold," he said, pulling up his pants, showing his face. He made me smile as he handed it to me, so I could see it.</p> <p>"Oh, don't get down on your hands and knees like that...we need to get that thing out of here!" I exclaimed.</p> <p>I heard him laugh a bit at it, but he wasn't smiling anymore. He grabbed my hand again, pulling me away from his lap so I was standing and facing him. "I need a shower and some food," he said to me quickly.</p> <p>"Alright, where'd you guys go?" I asked him.</p> <p>"I think we went out to the mall," he replied. That actually made a bit of a mess though.</p> <p>"I have a really good feeling about you" I said, feeling proud of just saying that.</p> <p>"And you're all grown up, why don't you join in on the fun?" I turned to walk towards the stairs to go to the kitchen, he looked back at me over his shoulder.</p> <p>"You are, the new kid," he said, and pushed my hand out of his. I just turned to return it as he looked back at me. "I think you're ready to be a man."</p> <p>I smiled as I took it, feeling him pull me behind him to the door to the bathroom. I looked over at him as he leaned back against the door handle, he smiled at me when I bent down to look inside the shower. The steam was almost pouring out of me, and I could see it running down his body like a sheet. His legs were still in the hot water, and his face looked so different with his eyes closed and he had his hands behind his head, the one holding the water.</p> <p>The next thing I felt was his arms wrapped around me, pulling me against him. I leaned back against him when he kissed me, my hands on his ass, pulling him even closer to me. The door to the shower opened and I turned it to let in the shower, then my hands were moving upâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
