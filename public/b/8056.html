He looked me over like an animal and said, "Your outfit is stunning and I can't help but be attracted to you, I can't help but be extremely turned on. I am quite sure my face and my hair will be on fire and I am certain if we are seen going to the back of the club it would probably ruin our show."</p> <p>I couldn't help it and I took off the jacket and I was wearing a short red cocktail dress with a low cut back that stopped to mid-thigh. I have a petite frame with long flowing blonde hair and a very pretty smile. In a way it was a statement that I could never let go of it, I have never had any doubts about me being beautiful in my body and not in all my other attributes. I was wearing a strapless bra and I was very aware of that fact. We were going to have to talk about it in a minute.</p> <p>"Are you sure you are ok, I can't help it," I whispered, "there's no way you can see any skin." My voice was huskier with my words and I leaned closer to him with my elbow and as he looked me in the face he placed his right hand on my waist at the lower curve of my hip and slowly brought it up to my rib. He smiled at just how beautiful he thought I was and as I looked down into his eyes he took one of my hands and placed it on his right thigh. He put his hand back down and let my hand remain there. At this point I was quite nervous and just kept looking directly into his eyes so I could make no move to remove it or cover it with my head. I decided on the latter.</p> <p>For what felt like an eternity or so and we stood there talking for about a thirty second or so without looking each other in the face. He then leaned back from the desk, put one hand on the wall behind my chair, took my other hand in his hand and said, "I've always loved a sub and I really needed to get this experience out of you or I might have destroyed you. It's been so long."</p> <p>"So you want to get off to a point now then?" I asked as I gently squeezed his thigh.</p> <p>"Oh, sure why not, you're quite the sexy little doll. I think you should have something to talk about though. Come to think of it, I might even like it," he laughed and walked past me while removing his hand from mine. This time he did just as he was told and moved his other hand across my hip towards mine from the very back. In the very back of the room I could feel my skirt moving back and forth as it was beginning to lift away from my body and I kept watching him as he moved his hand over my body. He looked at me with a little smile while looking me over and said, "If I had known that the idea had suddenly appeared in my head I would have wanted a closer look at you from afar so badly before I got there. I don't see why one little part of me is so scared. I really do appreciate the way you have handled the situation and the other part of me is just as interested in getting out of here as you are. Would you like a little help now?"</p> <p>"You're taking me to places I've never even thought of before." I said as I reached my hand over to the counter and began to slowly stroke his thigh. Just as quickly his fingers disappeared as he put one of them on the top of my hand below the hem of my skirt. That sent me into another orbit.</p> <p>As I looked up at him again I knew my nipples were pushing against the soft material of my bra and I could feel he was looking at them. After several minutes I felt his fingers slide around my upper thigh and as they rose they just barely bumped into the crotch of my panties. As he reached my upper thigh his fingers moved up towards my lower and they had disappeared again. I had been right, his hand had reached down below my skirt and it was moving up towards my panties in the process of pulling up the hem of my skirt. He slid a finger under the edge of the material and I felt just a tiny bit of my bare skin. He brought his hand back up and then I saw the front of my panties. He pulled his hand away slightly and my panties slid down over his fingers. I was now breathing quite heavily and he took the opportunity to slide his other hand up my lower back towards my hairless pubic area which I then felt before as he pulled up. It also seemed as though it was happening just below my breasts. In fact if we weren't standing so close I wouldn't even have expected to find his hand under the hem of my short skirt to reach my inner thighsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
