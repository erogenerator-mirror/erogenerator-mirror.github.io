She pulled me off the couch and out to the hall so I didn’t hear the door slam. “You’ve got ten minutes. Go get out of your uncomfortable clothes and get on the bed with me. I want to get to know your body.”</p> <p>Once the door closed behind us, we moved together into sixty-nine position, and just stared at each other, smiling and talking about our day. A second later, my cock was in her mouth, and two tongues, one deep inside, swirling around each other. Our hands found and caressed each other’s bodies, and we found our way. I was on her bottom and I could tell she wanted me to fuck her; she was rubbing herself on my stiff cock. I rubbed her clit with my thumb, and she squirmed until it was erect enough, and I pushed it between her lips and into her sweet pussy. Her ass wiggled and jerked, and I rubbed her clit with my thumb as it drove in and out.</p> <p>We kissed and licked, and I thought I heard someone saying “Fuck me in the ass,” but she wasn’t to sure. I pushed my cock into her and fucked her sweet ass with long, slow strokes. She came hard, squirting. The next morning, she said, “The other shoe came off the same story I had of getting a blowjob at a strip club. Don’t worry about whether I’m gay,”, she laughed. Afterward, I told her I was just going to sit on the sofa and watch some TV.</p> <p>I found the right number of things for her to do. I bought two of those tapes – one to watch on my tablet – just for her. We watched them together, and found that we found us mutually sexier while we were together. We had been watching them almost every weekend, and it paid to see the tapes as soon as we got home. We were both satisfied and satisfied – we had been making love for nearly three months, and each other’s sex had been much more.</p> <p>I had called her into the bedroom, naked, and started undressing her, sliding down her body until I was just in front of her. My eyes were fixed on her shaved pussy, and I just stared as she reached down and pulled me forward so her clit could lightly brush my cock. I had always liked a pretty pussy, and I found myself standing almost at her feet as I licked her nipples, pulling her breasts together. I kissed her belly, then kissed and licked the outside of her pussy, and she raised her hips to make it easier, then lay back as I kissed down her stomach and over her clit. She was wet, and I could smell it. She lifted her legs high into the air as my tongue found her clit and I licked it as my finger found her opening, slid into her, and began stroking as I began sucking on her nipple while licking faster and faster. Her hips were writhing and thrashing, and my finger fucked her as I sucked her clit and sucked on her tits.</p> <p>“Oh, God! Oh, Yes! That’s so, so goooood!” she moaned softly. “Mmm, that’s it! That’s it”. I kept licking her clit while pressing her clit deep into my open mouth. I kept sucking her clit into my mouth as the first wave of her orgasm began. “Ohh! Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!” she cried. “Please, don’t stop! Don’t stop!”</p> <p>“Please,” I asked. I began to tongue fuck her pussy. “Oh, God, don’t stop! Ahh! Yes! Yes!” She came one more time, then I stopped and she pulled me up to her mouth and I kissed her hard and long and I pushed my tongue down her throat several times. The feeling of her mouth on mine made me cum inside her, and I pumped into her one last time and my cock slid out of her pussy lips and I began to kiss across her stomach and stroke along her leg as she was slowly coming down from her orgasm. Our mouths found each other again, and then as we kissed and licked our way down her body, we slowly, teasingly, began to climb the stairs of our sexual—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
