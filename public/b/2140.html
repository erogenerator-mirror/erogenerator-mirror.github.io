He slid one hand between them and she gasped when he slipped his fingers into her moist depths. She wrapped her legs around him and rubbed her hips against his, his penis fully embedded now. She closed her eyes and let her head fall back as he slid in and out.</p> <p>Lying together on the hood of the car, their lips still sealed, he began to massage her back. He worked back and forth, working his hands and his cock into her soft, wet tunnel. Her arms were a little loose from holding her in this position. She lifted her butt, pulling forward against him, meeting each stroke with a thrust of her own. She looked at him again. He'd kissed her long enough, but he was still only holding her wrists with one hand at a time.</p> <p>"My name is James," he said.</p> <p>"Lisa. Lisa."</p> <p>"I like the sound of that. You can tell I get it from a guy. I also like to think we're very alike in that regard."</p> <p>"Is that why the hood's opened up?"</p> <p>"It's because I'm wearing my glasses."</p> <p>"I hope I didn't cause you any trouble. They make me so nervous."</p> <p>"No. I'm pretty nervous as well. I'm just a quick learner. It was easy."</p> <p>He slid one hand around to her butt-cheek again, and that's when he started to pull her against him again. This time, the head of his penis was still inside her, and she felt the warmth of it inside her. She'd been so wet and slippery; it easily slipped into her without any problem. He slid another finger around her anus, moving it in circles as he slid his cock in and out of her, slowly at first, then faster, her tight, virgin back passage stretched around his cockhead. His fingers were moving around her back hole, making it feel even stranger.</p> <p>He kissed her, whispering against her lips. "Lisa, you're so ready for me."</p> <p>Lisa looked up at him from time to time, but mostly she just looked back at him. She reached back with one hand, and ran her fingers all along his chest, then down his stomach and around his cock. She touched him directly, then rubbed his entire length into her. As if in reply, she felt his finger start to rub again inside her back hole. She felt another finger. This time one that felt the same thing, pressing into a small hole there. Her eyes squeezed shut as she rubbed and moved her pussy on the head of his cock, wanting him there, wanting him to feel her fullness.</p> <p>"Does it hurt?"</p> <p>"Not too much," he said. "I didn't do it to hurt you."</p> <p>"Well, I don't mind; it just hurts when I'm nervous about it. I don't take it very well. Do it to me."</p> <p>James slid his finger out slightly—she gasped each time it slid back inside. He slid his other hand down her back to her butt, cupping it and guiding her movements. His finger found her puckered hole; she felt for the first time the sensation of his fingertip; she bit her lip to keep from screaming. His hand pressed down on either side of her waist, and he started to work his finger in and out of her back hole. He felt the walls of her channel give to him when he moved out and in a sudden thrust, his finger sank into her, making her scream. Her backside clenched in response to his finger's invasion.</p> <p>"Fuck me!" he shouted out, sliding his finger in and out of her. He reached between their bodies to press both breasts together before sliding his cock back into her. Slowly at first, he slid himself out of her once again, then in again. Her body started to tense; his finger went in and out of her as deep as it could go, then pulled it back out, still moving inside her. Her bottom moved on top of him as she felt him inside her. A third finger went in; she felt so full, stretched that a third finger didn't feel that good.</p> <p>He reached again—he pulled both of her wrists and held them against his chest.</p> <p>"Are you on top of me?" she asked. "Are you using your legs? What does it feel like to be on top?"</p> <p>James gave her a wicked smile. "It doesn't feel like it. It feels like you're on edge; in my arms."</p> <p>"This feels exactly like that!"</p> <p>"I can feel," he assured her, sliding his fingers out of her as he leaned back and took her nipple into his mouth.</p> <p>"Just like that," she murmured into his mouth as he did—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
