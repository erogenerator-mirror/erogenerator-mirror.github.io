She opened her eyes and looked up at him, realizing that she wasn't going to be able to keep holding back much longer and that this was going to be another intense orgasm.</p> <p>John got up beside her, laying beside her on his side. He had a warm arm gently holding her and a leg draped over each arm of the tub. They cuddled and kissed.</p> <p>Jeri just felt the need to tell her brother that she wasn't going to be able to hold back. She had a feeling she would go through that phase at least one more times. There would be a chance. It seemed like the same need had been there before for him to come along. Jela needed to make him her man now, and not just because it was the way she wanted it. She really wanted what the last couple of days had taught her.</p> <p>And, if something happened, she might have to go back to that life with him and he might be her man now. This time she would be the one that took that last chance.</p> <p>As John was telling her that he would never make her love herself again, Jela started to get excited. She looked up at him from underneath the water so she had access to a breast, which he didn't miss. She took one of her tits out, kissed it, and started to play with her nipple. She felt the softness and started to move her nipple between her fingers, feeling it growing under her hand. She looked up at him and said, "I don't want a baby in my arms."</p> <p>John lifted her head out of the water so his lips could kiss her. "It's okay. I'll make sure it doesn't happen soon. Maybe sometime in time we can arrange some sort of a nursery for it. I guess that I think a kid, a little boy would be nice, you know?"</p> <p>Jela laughed. "Oh, that's right. You're going to have a baby, aren't you?"</p> <p>John nodded. Then he got up and knelt by the tub, pulling his sister onto his lap so she could look at him. "We should talk about this now," he said. "I think I'll get up." Jela started to get up. He held her. "Wait," he said. "Let me go change and we can talk about this?" He got going. They went to the bedroom. He quickly went into her bathroom, took off his clothes and put on an old pair of boxer shorts. He sat back down and took the tube of lipstick from her purse. He had put a small dab of it on her nipples, right where the lip on his shaft had been. She couldn't hide it in the tube. He knew her nipples and his dick would be there. She'd had her tubes cut off. He knew he'd never have her nipple, just a light touch, a soft, light little kiss.</p> <p>She got out of her bath. She had some things of her own to put on, so she headed into the bedroom to get them. When she returned John had gone to see if something he wanted to do was going to help Jela with a pregnancy, or if she was going to become a daddy.</p> <p>Jela was thinking: "Oh, how wrong he was." She wasn't sure she was ready for him to get up and go to any of this. Was he, in fact, going to be her father?</p> <p>When Jela was ready to dress for the day, she looked at herself in the mirror while she stood there, looking for a place where she could run out of the house in something that was just plain sexy. But, she didn't want to change the dress before the man she was going to marry. So she tried to wear casual and let her hair down, but it was long and brown and didn't do much of a job. But, then she had her skirt on and it made her legs look even longer. And she tried to put on makeup and her lips were so soft. The idea that she would have a sexy man looking at her in the next two minutes, when he was just another young man, was actually kind of embarrassing.</p> <p>She wasn't sure how many men she would have if they happened to be with her, but she figured there would be a half dozen, a twenty-five. What would he think? "Just how many guys will come barging in and take all that he wants from my body?" She had to say, 'just like that,' but she didn't want it to be more than five minutes.</p> <p>Jela came downstairs about ten minutes later. She had been trying not to do anything but stand there in the middle of the kitchen wearing only her bikini bottoms. She knew she looked goodâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
