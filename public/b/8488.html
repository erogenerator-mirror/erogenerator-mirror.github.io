Hands were kissing my neck, ears, ass and legs, sometimes dipping into some hot wet hole and playing with my nipples. I knew from experience that it had to be a man.</p> <p>A couple of fingers were working their way between my cheeks to my hot wet pussy. I was sure it was being a man, but there was no doubt who. His mouth came down upon mine and we locked lips again. I sucked on his tongue, nibbling his lip, and he responded by sucking on my tongue. As soon as we broke for air a hand dipped down inside my skirt and started massaging my clit. I was wet instantly with a desire to be fucked.</p> <p>This was what I was going to do, but I wasn't going to get to him. We made out like lovers and I was going to fuck him. He was rock hard. I slowly lowered my mouth to his shaft, and took just the head into my mouth, swirling my tongue across it. I couldn't believe that I was actually sucking on him. I could feel him grow harder and larger in my mouth. I had never had one of these before. He pulled my head up a little so I could give him a better angle. I took his whole length into my hot moist mouth and began running my tongue up the bottom of it. It tasted so good. It took me a moment to figure out what I was doing and then I slid his whole shaft into my mouth. I could feel every vein and ridge on his cock, and it made me want to suck on him until I could feel him explode.</p> <p>I wrapped my hands around his cock, sliding them up and down his length. The feeling was amazing. I began sucking him even harder and deeper. He moaned and I felt him tighten up a little more. He wanted me. He wanted me right now. I was right on my own terms. I wanted to be taken into his hands and show him, take him into my wet and sweet pussy. I wanted to feel his cum flood my pussy.</p> <p>I wanted the first hard cock to be him. I wanted to feel his cock deep inside me. I wanted to feel his cum in me, on my body and in my mouth. I wanted my pussy to be filled with cum.</p> <p>I was ready. I needed to be fucked. He was not ready. I was not ready for him to fuck me at the same time I wanted for him to. I wanted him to take me from behind. Then I would fuck him.</p> <p>His hand continued to run up and down my leg, up my thigh and across my ass where his cock was sliding into me. It felt so good. I was getting harder. I could feel his cock was getting bigger and harder with no prelude in it. The desire to feel his cock fill my cunt to overflowing, but his cock was my man. I had to have it. I could feel the blood flowing through it, as it was pulsing inside me.</p> <p>I felt his fingers slide into my ass and then he was teasing my pussy with two fingers, pushing up against it, and slipping back and forth. He was fucking my with his fingers.</p> <p>I could feel my orgasm approaching. I wanted to be fucked, but I could not, yet. I could not. My body began to quake, as I began to feel the hot jism boiling up from my cunt to fill me again, and again. I felt his cock explode into my depths as a wave of pleasure overtook me.</p> <p>My husband's finger in my ass was driving me crazy. I am sure he could feel my body shaking, but I didn't care. It went on and on. I just let it take me. The moment my body was over, I was going to fuck.</p> <p>When I opened my eyes to look, he was gone. He was still in the chair beside the bed. His cock had softened somewhat and was now beginning to go down again.</p> <p>"I can't stand it," I said. "Please."</p> <p>In the meantime, I had just about fallen back on the bed. I wasn't sure if I would be able to hold out this long. He was there, but I wasn't sure if I could hold out any longer. Suddenly, he was on me and we rolled onto our sides, facing each other. I began to kiss him gently but deeply. His tongue sought mine. I put my hand in his lap, feeling his hardness.</p> <p>I couldn't help myself and I reached down on the bed and grabbed his cock. It had fallen out of his pants and was now fully hard. I started to stroke myself as I stroked his cock. I could feel his heart thumping rapidly inside him. It felt like we were in a dream.
