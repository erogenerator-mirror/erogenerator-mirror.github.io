She smiled and agreed. I got in the car and got out. She held my hand as I drove away with my arms wrapped around her. She drove in her father's driveway and then turned in her mother's driveway. After entering her mother's house the rest of the way home she turned and looked at me with tears in her eyes. "It'll get better. I promise." She said.</p> <p>I smiled and took her hand. I pulled in and we got out. Once I was inside her house she pulled me in for a kiss. I wrapped my arms around her and held her close. When we broke the kiss she stepped back smiling and looked at me. "Are you sure about this?"</p> <p>"Yes. Trust me. It will be so good. I want you!"</p> <p>"Me too," she answered.</p> <p>As I opened the back door of her car I looked around. "I have a hard on and a wet pussy." I said as I watched her pull out of the driveway and start to run around town.</p> <p>"Wait until we get a good deal in." She said as she leaned over grabbing my hard on. "It really won't take long."</p> <p>"How's this?" I asked.</p> <p>"Pretty good. If I was going to do all the work..."</p> <p>"It's fine," I assured her as I pulled her in for a long kiss.</p> <p>When we got to her place she pulled me inside and pushed me on the bed. She slid her body between my legs and began to stroke the hardness between them. I lay back and allowed her to slide my cock from its resting place. When she got down to the base of my cock she leaned over and slowly kissed and licked me. I felt the lips of her cunt engulfing me as her tongue worked it's way around the crown of my cock. When she got the tip of my cock just inside of her mouth she let it slide back down between her lips. I felt her begin to bob up and down my hard on. She held me deep in her mouth until I could feel her throat muscles begin to work on me. I held back until I was almost ready to cum, she then let her tongue work its way around the sensitive rim of my cock.</p> <p>When she felt me getting ready to shoot she slid my cock from her lips and slid her mouth completely over my hard on. She began to stroke me rapidly while sucking me. I heard my knees buckle and she reached down between my legs and stroked me. I grabbed her head and held her there while I shot a load into her waiting mouth. She slid her lips back over my cock head then slid them down the length of my cock. I tried to pull her mouth off my cock but she just held me deep in her throat.</p> <p>I let her slide from under on the bed and turn on the light. We moved around the bed and laid on our side with her head on my shoulder. I put my arm around her and she put her head next to mine. We lay there listening to the soft, quiet sounds of the forest.</p> <p>"I don't really know what you do in the forest," she said softly, "but I'm not exactly in the woods all that often."</p> <p>"I just think that it's a fun place to relax and be and watch and it's a nice place for a lover to watch." I told her.</p> <p>"I'm sure," she said softly. "I like to think I'm doing that to you. I just got a little lonely." "I'm glad," I told her. "That is why I thought it would be nice for you to be around me."</p> <p>"You're welcome. I like to think I can't turn you out."</p> <p>I held her a bit longer, thinking that she was probably a little uncomfortable. Then I gently kissed her on the cheek. "I'm sure you'll think the same about me."</p> <p>I got up and went to the door and opened it. It was dark out and she was curled up with her legs tucked under her body. There was a little puddle of her juices on the bottom of the puddle. I reached out and wiped it off and then I looked around the room. I took the lamp out of the closet and had it turned on. When my lamp's light came up I held it up to her and said, "Why don't you just curl up in the comforter and we'll do a little window watching?"</p> <p>When I saw she was about to ask what I meant she said, "Okay." Then she quickly jumped up and hugged me tighter. When she was done, she leaned back. "I really did really mean that."</p> <p>"Didâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
