"I guess I'm just trying to make our weekend together memorable. Is that alright with you?"</p> <p>"Of course! Let's go!" she said, as she took my hand and pulled me up for a quick kiss. She also snuck one of her hands down to my underwear, finding my cock quickly beneath it.</p> <p>"It's not a lot of room! I'm not really going to the club with you on our first date," I said feebly.</p> <p>"I'm fine," she assured me, kissing me again. "So, do you want to come with me to the club again?"</p> <p>"What do you mean?" I asked.</p> <p>"I mean, do you want to come?" she repeated teasingly.</p> <p>I was speechless.</p> <p>"Lilly," I said, as she suddenly pushed me down on the couch.</p> <p>"But you should, you're my best friend," she giggled as she leaned toward me and began kissing me.</p> <p>I felt a jolt of pure sexuality as the older woman's soft mouth came up, kissing me with her tongue.</p> <p>I had the sudden urge to push the older woman away, to give her something else to think about.</p> <p>She had been teasing me the moment I had laid eyes on her. Her short pixie pixie-red night-gown looked so inviting that it was almost like I was looking at a naked woman.</p> <p>I couldn't take my eyes away from her lips. They almost stopped just below her pink tip. Her lips were so full and soft, and her dark green eyes looked so inviting that her lips were inviting me to kiss them.</p> <p>"Lilly!" I muttered as my hands began pushing her nightgown up and down her legs.</p> <p>"Nonsense!" she giggled, then pulled her lips from mine and began stroking me. "After all, I want it all to be memorable for both of us."</p> <p>She continued to play with my cock. I closed my eyes and enjoyed this moment.</p> <p>"I want you to give me your best friend's cock," she cooed as she brought her lips back down to my cockhead. "You should know."</p> <p>I groaned in frustration.</p> <p>"Come here then, sweetheart," she said sweetly, pulling me toward her.</p> <p>I kissed her warmly as I knelt on the floor. I couldn't believe how much I was enjoying kissing her. She kissed me with such hunger that I thought our mouths were going to split and my cock would explode out of my shorts.</p> <p>"That's it, baby," she cooed as she held me by the shoulders and started kissing me at my chin button. "Let's take that shirt off so I can lick your pussy while we get ready for work."</p> <p>"I don't think I'm ready for work yet," I panted, although I wasn't sure.</p> <p>"It's too late for that," she told me. "I'm all yours tonight."</p> <p>"I don't ever want to be anyone else," I said as I looked down at her and pulled her into my arms for another passionate kiss.</p> <p>"I've been thinking about this for weeks, sweetheart," she said softly, then took my left hand and placed it into her panties. "Rub away."</p> <p>I was surprised how wet my hand was getting.</p> <p>"I want you to rub me," she said softly, taking my right hand and pulling it towards her pussy.</p> <p>"Lucky I didn't put panties on," I muttered, but she made me laugh.</p> <p>"There you go," she whispered, then took my hand and placed it on her pussy. "I'm so wet for you."</p> <p>"God, you just had fun," I groaned as I was slowly stroking her clit.</p> <p>"I can't wait to feel your lips on mine," she giggled. "Let's get you a lap dance, okay?"</p> <p>"Can't you wait until later to watch me strip off and sit on your lap?" I said, grinning.</p> <p>"But right now, I'm all yours," she said as she held my cock in her hands. "We've still got time."</p> <p>She guided me down to the carpet and we fell to do a lap dance together, her legs straddling mine. I felt like she was on a rollâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
