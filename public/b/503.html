All of the stimulation in her body was concentrated on her clit. Her first orgasm was coming; so was even her second. And he too, was coming; and the same moment was coming, her second, a third, a fourth, and finally, her fifth. He pressed himself deeper and deeper into her canal and began working himself out. When he came back he was still in her. He took it out. Her vagina held him. He started to pull it back out, but he held it in place.</p> <p>"No," she cried. "Let me have another."</p> <p>She was desperate to have him back in her. She wanted to be taken again. He still had his cock inside her! He began pumping in and out of her. A new emotion seemed to invade her; desire? Lust!? Lust! It was all new to him! He had never before been able to last this long in his life. It seemed like hours before he felt his semen rising again. He pulled out of her.</p> <p>"Take me."</p> <p>Her expression changed immediately.</p> <p>"Let me."</p> <p>"Please?"</p> <p>"I can't, you have to finish me."</p> <p>She took his face in her hands and kissed him. Not the way she loved to kiss, but a long loving kiss that spoke of caring for each other. She began pumping his cock.</p> <p>"Please finish me!" she begged. "Please! Please! I need you!"</p> <p>She knew he couldn't hold back much longer.</p> <p>"Fill me up!"</p> <p>He pulled her with him as he took her from behind. His hands held both her breasts and he rubbed his cock against her lips.</p> <p>Her lips parted to catch a jet of semen that came from his cock and she smiled at him lustfully.</p> <p>'Damn, I thought she knew what was going on!' She thought. 'I love these women!' She smiled. 'These women can come a long way.'</p> <p>And when they came, she wanted more again.</p> <p>************</p> <p>This was different. This wasn't just another woman. This was something else. An exciting new emotion. No! It was something even more wonderful in each case.</p> <p>It became a game! The more excited she seemed that she got the more excited he became by it. The more excited she became she fucked him faster. She liked that!</p> <p>He enjoyed it so much! It was so much of a thrill!</p> <p>He didn't cum. It just made him feel like he was going to cum. He couldn't. He continued fucking her as her climax built. He could feel in her vagina her excitement was coming up!</p> <p>There wasn't anything he didn't do. He fucked her! He fucked his wife! He fucked his wife! he fucked her! he fucked her!</p> <p>There must have been no stopping the sexual excitement. A dozen orgasms? Two? Four? She was coming again!</p> <p>"Yes! Cum for me!" she whispered, as he pounded into her, harder, harder. "Cumming! Cumming! Cumming! Cumming!"</p> <p>She was there! He felt it on the inside! His cock began to swell. He started filling her cunt with his semen. She came with him again! They both climaxed together; again! Finally they relaxed and drifted to the bed. They were soon dressed.</p> <p>"How does it feel?" she smiled. "To fuck your wife after the way we did it?"</p> <p>"It was incredible!"</p> <p>"Thank you darling," she leaned over and kissed him deeply; sharing just a hint of the taste that they had shared before.</p> <p>"Well, it didn't leave anything to the imagination here at the hotel," he laughed. "It was a really good night."</p> <p>********************</p> <p>As she woke, she noticed the alarm wasn't blinking. She checked the clock; she knew it was 4am: 3am in Chicago, and she remembered it all vividly. Her husband and his sexy wife. He wasn't there; she knew it was him. She lay there thinking of what it was like to be in this bed with him. That was what it all felt like, that he still loved her.</p> <p>She thought that maybe he just needed to go to the bathroom; clean up after a good fuck. As if she couldn't get enough of his cock, she continued to think about how wonderful it was to make love with him. She couldn't wait to meet him. She also couldn't wait to have him with her. The desire to take him had gone. She wondered if she could make it another morning like last night.</p> <p>********************</p> <p>It was 5:30am. Just after 6amâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
