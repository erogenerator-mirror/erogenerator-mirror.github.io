For several minutes, they simply watched and looked at each other. Then, he said, "Well don't you want to?" She blushed, obviously at her nervousness about this. "I do too?" she answered.</p> <p>"I think we both do," he said as he stood up and took her hand. He moved behind her and felt her body, the soft curves of her buttocks. "You do need some reassurance after what we've gone through," he whispered in her ear. Her heart melted. And, his arms surrounded her again, holding her tightly as their lips met. He was surprised that she still thought she was straight and had never really considered this as a possibility so quickly, yet she could tell something about herself deep down that made him excited to do this. They kissed each other. First in a slow, easy way; then in a long, drawn out kiss that seemed endless. His hands were roaming all over her back, sliding his fingers through the hair and down her spine. Her skin had a smooth texture; even he had to admit, she had the best ass he had ever gotten in his life.</p> <p>He reached down and unclasped her bra and let it fall to the floor. "You have a lovely body," he told her as he kneaded her breasts. "How about now? Would you like me to go down on you?"</p> <p>"Oh yes," she said enthusiastically. "Yes, Mr. Anderson!" She was eager for him to do it. "Let me get undressed!" "Not yet," he said, kissing her neck as his hands moved from her back to her chest. "I want to see you for a while first." He began to unbutton her blouse. "Now, let me see those beautiful breasts," he ordered, taking a nipple in his mouth, sucking it and nipping it with his teeth. His hands followed, slipping and sliding down over her stomach and waist. She shivered and groaned. "Very nice," he said. Then he pushed her back against the door's frame. The air hit her as she lay back on the door's cool, smooth wooden surface and lifted her head to see his eyes. Her hands flew to his face, holding him tightly to her breast as he kissed her mouth again, pulling her closer by the waist. He pulled her toward the door, not yet moving to undress her. He pulled her shirt off and then his own top, both falling to the floor. They stood, holding each other's faces in their hands as he stared at her. Her breasts were now heaving with her breathing. She reached behind her with both her hands and undid his button and zipper. When it was a last moment to be able to touch her and she felt him pulling off his own underwear, she stepped back to look at him. His cock was hard, straight and proud as she took him in her hands and ran her hands over his muscular form. She could tell that he was clean-shaved underneath and felt her fingers caress and stroke her fingers as they slid over him. She leaned over and kissed him, sliding herself down until she was resting against his thigh and he was in her. "I want you," she said, pulling herself up, bending to kiss him again. "Now!" she said, pulling him close and kissing him again. Her lips felt so soft against his as he leaned back on the door's cool surface. Her hands slid down his chest, over his abs and on up to his cock. "Oh, yes please," she whispered, "yes please." This time he held her back, not letting her go, just letting her slide over him. "Now!" she said again. He bent his knees as much as his position would allow, spreading his legs for her. She had never felt a man take control from behind, nor had any woman before her. She could feel him slide in just slightly, before she felt a new sensation; he was fully inside her and she felt full. Her whole body felt alive as the feelings of his cock and his hands moved in and out of her, spreading her open more and more with each movement. He felt her clench at his cock as she felt him grow even harder, pushing it deeper inside of her. She could feel him press up against her cervix. She was on fire now, as he began to fuck her, driving it deep inside of her. He pulled out and then slid himself all the way back inside of her. She was completely helpless in his hands; his cock sliding effortlessly in and out of her wet pussy.
