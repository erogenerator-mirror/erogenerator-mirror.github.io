A couple of blocks from the restaurant, they got out of their bunks and headed for the door of the hotel bar they were staying in. As they entered the bar, the bartender asked the men to come up with someone to get their beers. They complied and, by the time the bartender returned with their beers, both of their beers were gone and the bar was empty.</p> <p>The waiter said that he recognized the name from the menu when he came in. When he saw that it was the man who had served them to the other three guys, he smiled and said, "Hello, welcome to our bar! It looks like you guys have already been drinking."</p> <p>"I sure do," said the waiter. "We are only getting a couple of beers, if your guys are not coming home soon. We'll need them later, in fact, we'll need to wait until tomorrow morning for our pints. If you're interested, you'll bring the check and we can pay your tab. It's still early, but I can tell that your guys will have a good time and we'll have a good time if you are interested."</p> <p>"That sounds nice," said the waiter. "But what are the other names in the bar?"</p> <p>The waiter told him, 'That's up to you. But you'll have to come up with your own name to determine who is calling you. For now, I'll make the bartender send us a list of names. They'll probably be the names of the guys who are with us. We have been waiting patiently for the same name before, so our list for our drinks can change by just asking."</p> <p>The waiter took the waiter's orders and left the bar. "I have to buy our pints for my men, just to save some money so that I won't have to take care of them while they watch the game on ESPN. I'll buy them both beers, in fact, if you want me to."</p> <p>"No, I don't want you to buy them either. I want to get you a beer. I'll just charge them the same amount in advance. I don't want you to charge me for another beer without paying for the beer itself. I'll charge you for any drinks I can find. That would be nice."</p> <p>Cecile laughed at the idea of having the waiter charge for one beer. He laughed and said, "No, I want you to feel confident and know you're going to receive an appreciative tip. Are you interested in being a little tipsy now?"</p> <p>"I'm not sure. I'll let you decide," responded Cecil.</p> <p>"Okay, we'll leave it at that. What kind of wine do you have?" asks Cecil. "I'm going to need three glasses of red."</p> <p>"Yes, please. It's on the house."</p> <p>"No, it's not on the house. It's in the bathroom."</p> <p>The hotel manager was going to go back into the bar, when he saw Cecil enter with the other guys. The manager saw Cecil come into the bar and said, "Well, gentlemen, we've made a mess of it up here. So, we should go into the bathroom and let our guests wash their hands or do some washing up to help clean the room."</p> <p>"No! I can't do that. It would be my duty as your bartender to clean the room!" begs Cecil.</p> <p>"Please, Cecil. You can do it. You'll do it right here; just for us, right?"</p> <p>"We'll have to clean you up, too, if you don't like it like this," replied Cecil.</p> <p>"I don't care; I'm going to get all four of you out of these potties when they return," says Cecil. "Please, let's go to our bedroom. We'll wait out here, if you don't mind! How about it; will you wait one more drink before coming back out here while the others clean up, and you too can have their pints of wine and their drinks to share?"</p> <p>As Cecil left the bar, the two men made their exit. Cecil said, "I can't believe my wife was going to go to all this trouble on her birthday!"</p> <p>"You don't want to do it on your birthday", I want to do it on my eighteenth birthday, because you're already married and won't want to waste my wedding gift like this."</p> <p>"You're trying to kill me!" asks Cecil.</p> <p>"Let me get this straight, while I'm still pissed at you. You're already married and have a little wine beside your mouth and you're already married. If that's your wedding gift, do it. I'd even think about it. Or, if it's the rightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
