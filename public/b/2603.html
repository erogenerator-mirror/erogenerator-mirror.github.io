I don't want to fuck anything in particular. Just finish what you started!"</p> <p>Again I was surprised and said, "OK, but only this time I'm going to do it on you."</p> <p>"Hush! It's OK." She kissed me and said, "If it's Ok by me, I want to try to make it a good one. Right then!"</p> <p>I didn't have to be asked twice. I rolled her onto her back and started to lick her sweet pussy again. This time she grabbed my head and pulled on it, almost forcing me to take her completely in my mouth. She told me later that as my hands massaged her ass, her hands kept grabbing my head and pulling me hard into them. It didn't take long and my mouth was flooded with her cum and I drank all it went.</p> <p>The whole time we were kissing, I kept thinking about what would happen, if I had to do it for her again.</p> <p>Finally, she whispered to me, "I think you'd better go back to camp in order to catch your plane. You're going right back to your seat now. If you are in that seat, I want to keep my cunt."</p> <p>I told her I couldn't do that, but she reminded me that it's OK to touch me anytime. I really loved her, and didn't mind if she had another lover, but it was going to happen tomorrow and not just once.</p> <p>About that time, I heard the water running, and she walked out of the bathroom. I heard her tell the door to my cabin that she would meet me in the kitchen in one week. She left the door of the bathroom cracked and I heard her enter the bathroom with a big smile.</p> <p>After she had hung her clothes, she came out of the bathtub, dried herself off, got dressed, and went into her bedroom. I heard the water stop and when she came out to the kitchen, she said, "I'll have your coffee back soon."</p> <p>In the meantime, my roommate was in the bedroom, talking on his cell phone and sitting on the bed. He said he had just come home after a night-ending with the football team, but that he had a job to finish in the morning, and he should be back by then. He had left the window open so that it lighted all of his bedroom windows.</p> <p>His name was Bill, but sometimes I think he was called Bill. When my mind wandered my cock hardened and got more interested than it ever had in me living with a stranger, knowing what sort of trouble we had caused.</p> <p>When I finished my coffee, I opened my closet and pulled out the first of many outfits that I was planning on throwing at her, but instead of putting them in the clothes hamper, I took them back to my room. It was going to be a lot of fun and I told her so.</p> <p>That night, I kept thinking of how she would want to be with me. I thought about what she had said about how she would want that very thing with me to happen. I had to think hard about that. I decided that if I could not come to terms with the situation, I would have to go through with it tomorrow, but it was better to leave it all in the past, because I didn't want it to become a long drawn out affair.</p> <p>I figured that I had better dress her for the job we wanted and that I would go get some clothes and some cash from my house as soon as they arrived. I pulled on my robe and headed to the bathroom. I looked in the mirror and my eyes were looking right at my cock and I had decided that I couldn't put it away. I had only seen Bill in my head. Then I looked down at myself and saw that I was still staring at my cock. I wondered to myself who had got me all worked up the previous night and then decided that there had only been a one night stand. It was the one where I had let him put his tongue in my mouth. I figured that if I ever got the opportunity to, I would let him, but it was going to be a long time.</p> <p>I took a long look at my cock and saw that it seemed to be getting bigger with each beat of my heart. It seemed to get larger, but not like my own. As my mind wandered, I slowly started to slide my robe open and looked down at it. My cock rose up a little bit and came as it reached for the mirror and I felt a warmâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
