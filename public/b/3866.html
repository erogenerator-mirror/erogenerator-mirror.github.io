"I just want to be with you," he said. "I can't be away for too long." He slipped his arms around her.</p> <p>"Then I can be with you then," she murmured. Then, "Why shouldn't I be with you tonight?"</p> <p>"I wanted to do that," he whispered. He kissed her neck and she shivered.</p> <p>"I can't," she gasped. "I got kicked out of my house for something I want to do," she added with a giggle.</p> <p>"If you got kicked out for something you want to do, the answer is, 'yes'," he murmured. "We can do everything together, and I have been thinking about how to make that happen," he said with a smile. "But I got kicked out last night when you did."</p> <p>She giggled. "I missed you last night, you asshole," she whispered. After a moment she pulled away from him and said, "I don't want to make love to you, if you don't believe me, but I want to make love to you." He gave her a puzzled look, but said, "You want to kiss me right here."</p> <p>Natalie nodded. She stood up and walked around the bed. She opened the bottom drawer of her dresser door and pulled out a few tissues that looked like they had been used before, but Natalie didn't know what made her want to put them in his mouth. She knelt down on the floor and slowly removed the top part of his jacket. His shoes were next, and then a pair of jeans followed. She pushed them down and felt his body shivering in anticipation at seeing that thing in her hand. She pushed the crotch of those jeans down over his cock and it jumped, not to her. He was wearing a t-shirt. Natalie smiled. That was her first time with a man, and she liked it. "Do you know what a t-shirt is?" she asked, and he looked down at himself confused. "Not what this is, exactly," she said as she stepped back and pulled the shirt from his hands. "You will see," she whispered as her eyes took him in their gaze. Then she stepped back to look at the bulge she saw the day before. "It's a big cock," she whispered. "It was the one I stole from my mother's bedroom."</p> <p>"Oh," he said softly. "Don't worry it won't hurt you," he murmured, and then added "and I love being your first..."</p> <p>Mara pulled her t-shirt over her head. Her breasts were small, barely a handful, but they were firm and her areolas were large and dark brown, and her nipples were already hard, waiting for attention. She leaned over to take them in her mouth. He was so close to her that she could feel the heat of the sun on her back. When he came down on her, her skirt came up well above the crack of her ass. She leaned over to let him in as he got more and better at sucking on her nipples. His cock was already hard.</p> <p>"Oh, yes," moaned Natalie as he kissed his way down her stomach to her pussy and up the inside to her clit.</p> <p>Mara licked her lips. "God, yes," she moaned. "I needed this so much."</p> <p>Mara's hands slid up and down and all around his head. He was a little thinner than she was, but he took her hard and deep and she was wetter then she thought she'd been. She stroked that shaft with one hand and reached back with the other. She knew that she'd wanted to get this over with when she tasted herself on his tongue. Natalie watched, mesmerized, as a finger slid inside her, and another slid into her ass from the other side.</p> <p>She moaned and leaned back more to let him take her into his mouth. He licked up the inside of one and down the other. Natalie felt her muscles tighten up and knew she was close. "I'm close," she whispered between breaths. "I'm going to come," she said as the orgasm started to build.</p> <p>"Then you'll be fucked good and hard," he groaned against her clit. Natalie felt a rush of mixed feelings as he sucked and pulled away from her. But his lips were back with his cock so she couldn't have a thought anymore about what he'd wanted to come over to do to her. He was so close to her, she felt so close.</p> <p>Before she had a chance to think about all else, another orgasm built deep inside her and spread out from beneath her legs until each was a scream of ecstasy. The orgasm tore from her like a freight trainâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
