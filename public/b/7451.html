They were all excited, and for the first time Andy got a glimpse of Tina, and he suddenly felt as he had that morning. She was naked, her gorgeous breasts were hanging down, her body tight. He couldn't see her nipples but he was sure he was seeing them as he stood by the door watching her. It was as he had dreamed it would be, just a few moments before, that he felt her hand touch his shoulder, and he felt his heart pounding in his chest again. "Hey, Andy! How are you feeling with what happened last night?" asked one young woman's voice from the doorway. "Tina looks so fucking sizzly all over!"</p> <p>"Yeah, look at her! She's all sexy but she's a lot of fun to be around," the other one laughed.</p> <p>Andy couldn't really tell who the younger girl was at first, but he couldn't have stopped himself if he wanted to, so as he followed her and joined her, one of the others walked over behind her and was rubbing her boobs.</p> <p>"Nice tits," he said.</p> <p>The hand on his shoulder was suddenly tugged away and pulled away. She squirmed and pulled away from the hands so quickly and quickly they almost touched Andy. He felt their soft, firm breasts against his chest and felt his cock swell again. Without knowing who it had come to, he felt the soft skin of one of the others' breasts brushing against the front of his shorts, and he smiled.</p> <p>"Whoa, that's a little different," he said as he pulled away from the others, leaving only the tip of his cock and his hand between his legs. It felt hot in his warm, soft hand and he felt a wetness in his shorts that he hadn't realised he was producing.</p> <p>"I can't tell anything else about it except that it felt kinda good when you touched it," the young girl said softly.</p> <p>"Thanks, I think," Andy said as he returned his hand to the woman's body again, this time cupping one of her boobs in the palm, feeling the weight of the boob. The girl laughed.</p> <p>"Wow, you seem a lot more grown up this way, and more energetic!" she said, "I don't think I'm going to be a model any time soon!"</p> <p>She pushed herself even closer to Andy. Her skin felt silky and soft to his touch and it felt as though he were caressing the small of her back, but when he pressed himself against her as though he was afraid she was going to resist he just felt like he was touching her like he had touched her. Something else, something he had never felt before, something exciting. It was as though all of Andy's body responded to the touch of another man's and he was surprised to find that it was making him feel like a teenager again.</p> <p>Suddenly, he felt Tina pressing herself right next to his ear, her breath whispering into it.</p> <p>"I wish I could feel this way with anyone," she breathed, "I always wanted to be with a girl, like you and your family, but never got the chance."</p> <p>"Can I talk to Tina tonight? She's really quiet lately," Andy said as he turned and lifted her chin, kissing her.</p> <p>"You really should ask her, Andy," she gasped, "if you're here at all. She's usually so calm when she's upset, I doubt she's upset."</p> <p>She let go of his ear, running her hand down his bare chest. He thought about it, and he knew that she would probably feel a little more confident by coming out, but he didn't know if that would get him through to her.</p> <p>"She'll be okay," he said as he moved back a little. Tossing his shorts back on the couch, he went over to her, his hands on her waist. He leaned over to kiss her, and then, before she could put a hand on his head, he kissed all across her face, looking into her blue eyes, smiling.</p> <p>"Are you okay, Tina?" he said again as he pushed himself against her and kissed her again, this time more firmly.</p> <p>"I'm fine," she said a little uncertainly, "I just kind of felt like things might not be as they seemed at first. Is there any chance you can get away from me some time, if you want."</p> <p>"Sure," he said. He wanted there to be a little more than that, he wanted to feel her atâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
