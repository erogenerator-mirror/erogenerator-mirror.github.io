This time, as dinner went on, the bottle of wine was open, and the conversation was light. I asked if anyone was on-line and she smiled again, and nodded, with a soft voice that indicated approval to her. After supper, we started looking for the computer.</p> <p>There were already four windows and we were looking for one with a keyboard. After searching the desk area, we found another in her corner. Her computer was not set for the Internet, though. The office had an office.</p> <p>"We need to do some work here too" she said. "We'll be out a while." "That's good," I said with a wink. "I think we can find the computer if we can find it." "Sure," I said. "I can do that, too."</p> <p>"Thanks," she replied, and reached for mine. "Let's jump into my desk."</p> <p>We walked over to her desk, and she grabbed a chair on the other side of it. We sat down and she started on her computer. It was very easy: she had a hardwood back panel, and the desktop had buttons and switches that she needed to type the job. I was sitting next to her with my arms around her waist, feeling her body against my own.</p> <p>She typed something in a word processor, and turned the computer to full screen. It took forever. Then the screen flickered and blinked on as the screen filled with a picture of a white haired woman. The picture clearly showed that she was on her back on a desk, legs spread and a cock thrusting in to her doggie style. She was looking at her face and looking at the monitor. The expression in her eyes was clear, and she was loving.</p> <p>I had never imagined a female like this in my life. Her body language clearly showed that she was extremely turned on, and her facial expression conveyed that she was aroused, too. She was definitely wet now, and my cock was hard. We just looked at each other. She took a short, sharp breath, and then started typing some more words.</p> <p>"What are you looking at, David?" she asked. "How are you going to get to fucking her?"</p> <p>She typed some more words, finally hitting "button."</p> <p>"It's a cock-in-vagina thing," she finished.</p> <p>"I bet it is" I replied with a grin.</p> <p>"I think it's a very big cock," she asked. "And it's big!"</p> <p>Well, that was interesting, too. A guy and women fucking, not a keyboard or phone?"</p> <p>"Yes, it sure is. We just found out. We've been working together for a long time. We're very, very good friends." She wrote a few more words to indicate how much she wanted her pussy eaten.</p> <p>We continued with the typing, just as we had done before, and she finally had to put a stop to it.</p> <p>"I need to get the mouse back up again" she said, reaching for the mouse again. "I need to turn the screen off."</p> <p>"Not yet," I said with a smile, pushing the keyboard back in her direction.</p> <p>She looked at me and said: "I can't do that, either. They'll be in here by the time the computer gets up."</p> <p>"Let me turn it off if you don't mind," I said.</p> <p>"Not at all" she said. "Just keep quiet for now, please."</p> <p>"Thank you," I replied, "and may I ask, can you do back windows for us as well?" "Sure."</p> <p>She clicked to another of the windows, typed something, and typed something on the keyboard. Then she typed:</p> <p>"I want you to pull my pussy hard by the legs, and fuck it long and really deep. I want to be open for your cock. I want to feel your balls slap against mine every time you cum." "Are we ready to get the windows off?" she asked. "Just take the windows!"</p> <p>We set the windows off, and she quickly turned them off, and turned the monitor on. Then she pulled her shirt off, pushed her skirt up onto her hips, and pulled her panties down to the sides. She lifted one of her legs and pointed it at the ceiling, and then she lay with legs spread wide apart. I walked over and stood behind her.</p> <p>Her pussy was wide open and pink, ready, waiting for me. I pressed my already stiff cock between her legs, and pushed in forcefully.</p> <p>"Ooohhhh," she moaned. "That feels good" "Give me more," she told me.</p> <p>I did.
