It didn't stop me from thinking about our encounter the other day. Perhaps our sexual life would have been different if not for my friend's advice and, I'm sure, my body. How could I ever be as confident at the prospect of another sexual session with my friend's wife as I am now? Yes that is exactly the type of situation Rachel and I would've enjoyed in the past, a few encounters now and then leading to fantasies like tonight’s events. And here we were.</p> <p>Rachel and I continued kissing, our hands exploring each other's bodies, taking it slow until suddenly she was on her back and I was on top. She let out a moan, and began playing with my nipples, slowly working her way down. Rachel has always been an insatiable and willing lover, but tonight she must have been as well, her body eager to explore our new friend's body. The sexual chemistry was incredible, and my body was writhing in a combination of excitement, nervousness and desire.</p> <p>My hand drifted down towards her crotch and my fingers ran through her thick, blonde bush, feeling the dampness as she lay back and opened her legs a little, encouraging me to explore her. I quickly explored her wetness and was surprised at the way she responded to my touches. She had had many girlfriends and I could only imagine how close she must be to experiencing what she was now feeling. I pulled her panties aside with two fingers, slipping them into her tight pussy. Rachel spread her legs apart as I felt her slickness and gasped when my finger slid inside her. The sensations were amazing, but I had to be quick. I rolled over so that she was on her back in front of me and quickly found my way into her hot pussy. I was amazed at how quickly she had started enjoying my finger, although I had to admit I was a little worried about how sensitive her clitoris would be. I worked it back and forth a little feeling her clit as it expanded and hardened in response.</p> <p>Finally I worked two fingers against her clit, rubbing it in circles while massaging her inner walls. It felt wonderful, but the anticipation was building at a higher and higher level. I moved so that I could be able to feel both her vagina and her clit at the same time, as well as being able to play with both of her pussy lips at the same time. Rachel was starting to moan and whimper and occasionally she would thrust her hips in the bed as my fingers worked her. Her breathing returned to normal after a few minutes and I gently extracted my fingers from inside her, kissing them to be as discreetly as possible. Rachel reached out and placed her hand on the back of my head as I got her off, pulling my face down towards her. My tongue and lips began exploring her inner thighs, working their way closer and closer to her clit.</p> <p>Her moans quickly turned to little gasps of pleasure and her knees started to shake, her moans rising a little more with each beat of her hips. I licked away at her and sucked on her clit a little harder with my tongue, occasionally flicking it back and forth. Her breathing increased and she pulled my face up with one hand, trying to get more of my face into her. I had to hold her in place with both hands, knowing that there was no way I was going to be able to make her cum just by just one lick; at the very least. I started moving down her body, kissing and licking down her stomach as my hands pulled aside her bikini bottoms. I took my time as she had done to me, sliding her panties slowly down to reveal her glistening pussy. She was clean shaven and I could smell her. I continued to run my tongue up and down her swollen lips. I slid one more time inside her, but not too far.</p> <p>Rachel reached down and held my head between her legs, encouraging me to continue. I felt her moist labia slide around around my tongue and I could tell she was incredibly turned on. I used the flat of my tongue to gather moisture inside her and brought it up to her clitoris. She had moaned many times during our session, so I took the opportunity to add a little more pressure on her clitoris. As I lapped away at her she kept making little unintelligible sounds, even if her moans were more muffled by her legs.</p> <p>Rachel held tightly to my head, her body trembling with pleasure. When her moaning had subsided, she turned onto her side and moved over toward me, turning so that her pussy and my head were once again at the head of the bed. I gently placed my hand under her leg so that my fingers could reach over her body, exploring the softness there. I couldn't even imagine—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
