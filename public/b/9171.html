That's why she did it. It seemed right.</p> <p>She sat on the sofa and leaned against the cushions with her head on the back as her friend watched the game in front of her. She was very shy. I wasn't.</p> <p>This must be one crazy night. I think I might have a hard time catching up to Gina.</p> <p>A few minutes later, she stood up and held her phone out across the room and gave me directions. I took the phone out of her hands, and made sure there were no missed calls. Just enough for me to look at the calendar from the top of the camera. It had been so long since I had been in bed with a woman and this was the best way to show it.</p> <p>My phone is in my left hand. In my right hand, I'm holding a camera with my right hand. Not the type I use for work, but it is something to remember. I'm standing there trying to hide myself with my left hand, and trying to not look stupid. And the first camera is pointing toward Gina, so I'm looking right at her. I know she sees. She is smiling, and I know she's enjoying herself. I think I'm just a little tipsy. I think I'll see how many glasses of wine I get.</p> <p>She walks over and kisses me on the cheek. "That felt even better than I imagined," she says.</p> <p>"Good. Thank you," I agree. "Just let me finish my wine."</p> <p>"No problem," Gina replies as she stands and gives me a kiss on the cheek.</p> <p>I go back to the kitchen and start putting out my dishes. I'm sure it was one of the best nights in my life. I'm proud of my culinary skills. This guy really knew what he was doing. Just seeing a good man standing in the middle of his kitchen with a smile so innocent looking, just makes me feel more like a man instead of some guy with no manners.</p> <p>I pick up the plates from the kitchen floor and head upstairs to the bathroom, and wash my hands in the sink. I check my laptop, the video feeds from my camera, and see that the screen is up and running. After washing both, I head downstairs to the living room to watch a movie.</p> <p>I put the computer on a video chat window and start to click through the list of movies. I'm not used to anything that I watch, so there's only one of three movies. I guess the first movie is probably going to be a bad one to watch, and a third movie might end up a lot more interesting.</p> <p>Before you go mad, watch with me one of the few videos where people kiss and lick each other. Trust me, there will be plenty to watch over the next few days. I can't wait.</p> <p>I watch the video. I don't really know how I felt about it, but I can't wait to watch it with Gina again.</p> <p>A few minutes later, I click into the chat room I'm talking about.</p> <p>I start to type and type, in hopes that the email will start to come through. The chat's loaded, and there's already a message from Gina in my message box:</p> <p>"Hey, sorry I wasn't the first person to see the movie in the video in front of you. I'll catch up later.</p> <p>Gina"</p> <p>The next time I see Gina, I wonder if this was supposed to be a good night.</p> <p>Later, Gina is sitting on the couch with a few glasses of wine, watching the movie. I'm looking at her, too. We have a connection. I can't help think that this is so much better than the best sex night I've ever had.</p> <p>Gina has her laptop open, and is reading up on the story about cheating. There's very little of what I think about in this story, but for some reason it fills me. Maybe she's really good. Maybe she just doesn't know how to be better than me.</p> <p>She starts to feel good, and she doesn't seem to mind that I'm looking at her. She's a really good looking lady. I can't believe she's even with me right now. I'm still pretty buzzed myself, but I'm feeling comfortable talking freely about sex and relationships.</p> <p>Gina's eyes flick toward me. "How'd you sleep?" she asks. "Did you sleep good?"</p> <p>"No," I reply in my best boy voice. "You?"</p> <p>"Yeah," she replies, "I was thinking about coming home early at the last moment, and I had a bad dream."</p> <p>"You have a bad dream, too?" I have to ask. I'm sure my voice was too high for what she wasâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
