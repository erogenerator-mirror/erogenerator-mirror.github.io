I asked quietly.</p> <p>"No," she answered breathily.</p> <p>"Good," I said.</p> <p>We made small talk for the remainder of the evening. By the time we finished eating I was pretty sweaty and my hair was wet with it, but it was nothing I did not care for. Even so, I had no interest in getting cleaned up or getting into bed. We had dinner and then she left after paying off the loan.</p> <p>"Can I ask you something?" she finally asked.</p> <p>"Anything you say," I answered.</p> <p>"Do you have any friends on the boat, you know?"</p> <p>"Yes, I do," I said. "There are three of us and they were out there on the boat today trying to get their asses to the island."</p> <p>"It doesn't look like they would go," she said.</p> <p>"Oh, there is no one there. They have their room, they got their towels, and everything else, right? They will still be out there when they leave, but the boat will be in the water, right?"</p> <p>"Right," she agreed. There really seemed to be some logic behind it, or in some cases it did, and I was glad it did. "I just have no idea where they got their towels, or how they got their tarp from the side of the boat. I didn't think there was much of a beach here anyway"</p> <p>"Do you know where they sleep? I'm supposed to come to the door in their towels and bring them on board, right? I don't do it for everyone, but I can go back, and find them someplace to camp or just hang out there."</p> <p>"All that stuff about the beach, huh?" she asked. "I'd say they have a lot of staying power and a good time. I wouldn't mind getting my stuff up here myself, but I'm not going that far without getting in the shower first."</p> <p>"I guess I could give you a ride down to the island, but there are not many places there any more," I said. "You should try the beach this week, too. You could stay up there for a couple nights. They have great beaches."</p> <p>For all I knew she could have stayed there for two weeks, but she chose to visit and I really wasn't going to do that. I was going to go see a couple island bikinis, but I couldn't go and let them think I was going away without going someplace. Maybe the idea was for the girls to be naked along with me. It sounded okay to me anyway.</p> <p>The next week the three of us went out to the boat that was on the beach. It was the last vacation we had, so we had to find someone to stay with. I rented for just that reason. I found a beach that was really nice, it was really nice, and, in the back of my mind, I was not going to have to wait so long until we got back to the house.</p> <p>That night we went to that beach. We had a couple of drinks, ate some pizza, and, when my hand went down between her legs right there and then it was a really pleasant surprise. She came right up to me in the dark. She pulled my hand to her and we did not speak. It was really nice to hold someone so close to me, not only because I was holding her, but also because the moment I held her there almost immediately the fire that raged inside was gone.</p> <p>We sat around for a while and I could hear her talking to me. It was sort of funny, really, because that moment when she told me she just wanted to hold me, the same moment that I was holding her, we talked about all the things we wanted to do, and I told her of my desire to fuck, and some other nonsense. When she finally asked me if I had ever thought about making love to my mother in the dark, I didn't say anything.</p> <p>"You're crazy," she said, looking up at me with concern. "I have been doing it for all these years, but it is the same thing every time, only better."</p> <p>I nodded and we started talking about how long we would go at the beach and even what we thought of doing it in the dark. She said that she had never done it and I said that if she really wanted to go out there and start something she could do it herself. It was a kind of odd conversation, but I had a feeling we were going to get it on together some day.</p> <p>By this time it was after one in the morning when we finally had to stop and get a room for the night. I had my cell phone set up for the beach that I hadâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
