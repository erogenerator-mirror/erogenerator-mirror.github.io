"I did not fuck you. You should have waited until I get your cherry popped." He smiled with satisfaction. His cock sprang up again and was already harder than ever.</p> <p>"Oh no you don't," Amy replied. "I'm not you." She sat back down with a big satisfied smile on her face.</p> <p>"You really want to fuck me, don't you?" He asked.</p> <p>"Yes," she replied, her heart now racing, her pussy pulsating. "I do," she smiled. "I will make you come again, but only if you give me some relief. OK?"</p> <p>"I'll give you anything you want. Anything, Amy," he smiled. "Anything."</p> <p>He kissed her hard on her lips and she leaned back and sucked his dick into her mouth. He moaned with need, but she gently pulled away, smiling. He gave a knowing look at her and she knew he wanted to go again, but she was not going to push him. She was going to play along, to see what it would be like, to see if this was just a one time thing, but she just wanted him so much.</p> <p>As he kissed her forehead he looked at her, saw the love in her eyes, saw the desire, the excitement in her eyes. He knew that she was in control now, it was time for him to take control again. He kissed her on the lips gently and pulled her close. He took a deep breath, and gently kissed her lips.</p> <p>Amy sighed softly and he pushed past her lips, his cock coming in contact with her clit. She whimpered and felt her pussy getting warm. He slid his tongue between her lips in response and she began to move her hips forward and back. He knew it was going to take more and he wanted her to have it for herself, too, so they broke their kiss.</p> <p>"Wait," he said softly. "I don't want to do this again till we get to our bedroom, or your parents come up and find us in there. Do we have a choice?"</p> <p>She could have stayed there forever like that, but as soon as they started fucking she couldn't. She had a plan with her; she was going home with her boyfriend while she continued to fuck his brains out into heaven. She had been in this situation for years, with her ex boyfriend who had tried to make her do this, but she was still a virgin and no one had made any effort to make her do this again. Now she had the opportunity to take charge.</p> <p>She sat bolt upright as he lifted up off her. Their eyes met and Amy smiled at him, pleased with the change of fortunes. She started taking his cock in her hand and started stroking it. In her hand she found her clit, that was hard to ignore. It was too bad it didn't last long before it exploded into her hand and she almost felt sorry for the woman who took care of herself.</p> <p>He grinned at her as his cock hardened and she took it back into her mouth.</p> <p>"Is something wrong?" he asked.</p> <p>"No," she said, "absolutely nothing. I think I'll enjoy our first time together." She smiled at him, happy that he was happy to be with her, happy, happy to be in her good books, happy to be where she was and to feel her pussy pulsing around his cock again.</p> <p>Amy felt so guilty about what she did to him that she was not aware that she came in his mouth. She felt as powerful as that feeling had been, and she felt so powerful that she could do it in any way she wanted.</p> <p>"I'll get something out of this." Amy said quietly. "I got a taste of my own medicine. You can get it out if you want."</p> <p>"OK," he said. "Give me your shirt."</p> <p>She was going to turn around but he pushed her arms away.</p> <p>"No, you need to put it on." He said. "I might as well take it off and I'll help you with it if you like." He paused. "I'm not going to wear it to the hospital."</p> <p>"You can get all of that later," she replied with a smile, feeling naughty. "I'll get you another shirt, then."</p> <p>"No, I'm not tired enough for that."</p> <p>"Yes you are," she said. "It feels so good to have a penis in you."</p> <p>He laughed and kissed her full on the lips. "I know; it's going to feel really good, though. I'm going to try to get another erection this time. But don't go any further." He told herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
