She got up and looked into his eyes as they were filled with passion. She smiled back at him.</p> <p>She turned to walk away after pulling her pj shorts and panties off.</p> <p>"Can I join you?” he asked softly touching her cheek.</p> <p>Allison smiled at his words, not wanting to disappoint him.</p> <p>"That’s Ok, honey.</p> <p>He watched as she got up, and then smiled.</p> <p>She got off him and went into his bedroom.</p> <p>He could hear the shower running and he looked to see her in her robe, looking fresh and clean.</p> <p>There was a knock at the door.</p> <p>"It is time dear, come in, it is not time for you to change," John called.</p> <p>She came in and he could see everything she had changed over the past weeks.</p> <p>She looked so fresh, he thought and smiled back. He put his arms around her and kissed the top of her head.</p> <p>"I’m not sure of anything I ever thought I wanted, I just wanted to make you feel good," Allison said smiling back at him.</p> <p>She wrapped her arms around him and he felt something inside him.</p> <p>"I know honey," he said again just above a whisper.</p> <p>"You are so special to me.” Allison said not wanting to feel more so in his arms than she already did.</p> <p>He turned and walked to the bedroom.</p> <p>After he was in there and he heard her, he went to her and kissed her neck, he could still taste her.</p> <p>He looked down at her and she saw the desire he saw. She could feel his desire within her.</p> <p>"I want you, darling," he said softly.</p> <p>It had been so long for her. Now her desire had come over full force.</p> <p>Allison could feel him moving, knowing he wanted her.</p> <p>She knew he was going to take her, but she wanted to feel him, wanted him to be buried inside her.</p> <p>"Yes sweetheart," Allison whispered to him.</p> <p>"Yes dear, I want you, to be with me, to feel me, love me, to love you.”</p> <p>They kissed again and then stood there before him. "It feels so wonderful being inside you, being in your strong loving embrace and just saying I love you."</p> <p>Allison looked deeply into his eyes.</p> <p>“I want to feel what it is like to be a woman" she smiled as she felt his heart speed through with hers.</p> <p>The thought was very exciting to her, but she knew it was wrong to be this way with this man.</p> <p>"I want you too, but first things first,” she continued to say to him.</p> <p>As she kissed him, she pulled his pajama shirt off revealing his bare chest.</p> <p>She began to kiss and lick him down there, down the middle of his chest to his belly. Stopping right where he had been for so long, she looked up at him as if to ask if everything was alright.</p> <p>John could see she was serious, because her face, lips and tongue never left his body.</p> <p>They laid like that for a while as John ran his hands over her body as he watched her.</p> <p>When they had finished kissing, she began to tell him more about the changes being made to her body by her.</p> <p>“I have not known anything about women,” Allison said, looking down at herself.</p> <p>“I know about men,” he answered her, “and the differences in them.”</p> <p>She put her fingers in-between his legs, and felt his hard on, and said,</p> <p>“And I have no problem with women,” she paused waiting for some form of explanation.</p> <p>“I am very feminine, and it is not at all surprising that I will come out to you after all.”</p> <p>He felt her heart start to thump again just having heard the words the woman could say to him.</p> <p>She continued with her story of wanting him to know more.</p> <p>“First, a few months prior things were going well in the office,” she tried to make it clear, but the way he always said it made her a little uncomfortable.</p> <p>”When work was done, you could see the boss in her in the office.”</p> <p>As the story went on, she knew his manliness was gone.</p> <p>Now, as she explained to him what she felt about him, she was getting a hard on just from what he was saying.</p> <p>“She has been with a few women, but they were always more than just friends, and more than that! We all know, she could have been one.”</p> <p>She saw him look down as her—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
