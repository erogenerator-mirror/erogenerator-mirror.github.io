But at the same time he was always around people, people that he didn't even know. In the last four months, he'd been spending a lot of time around people, people that he didn't even know, people that he'd never even seen before either, but he'd always gotten to know. He knew the other guys would talk, and when the chance seemed real he felt like he could talk to them. Some of them were very friendly. But most of them were just a kid that he had to do a little dirty for, and he was too drunk and a bunch of trouble to take full advantage of. He wanted nothing more but for everybody around him to know he cared. The people that had come around him were all people he could think about, and that's all he did. And as much as he'd wanted to see who all the people were, he kept that to himself.</p> <p>As he opened the door to his truck and headed home, he couldn't help but feel that this was where he belonged. It was just his life. A part of him wasn't so sure he ever knew a people life.</p> <p>~~~~~~</p> <p>An hour or so later, a car horn sounded down the street. The driver was a black haired woman with short, dark brown hair. The woman parked her car a few miles up the driveway, and Anastasia, his new girlfriend, took two quick steps forward and looked in the rear view mirror as she walked toward her car.</p> <p>"Hey." She flashed a dazzling smile, and climbed into Anastasia's car, which was parked just a few doors down from hers. "How's it going?"</p> <p>"Pretty good, I guess."</p> <p>"Thanks. It's a nice neighborhood."</p> <p>"No, well, uh... no, they're not home. Uh... I'll call you later and I'll let everyone know where they are. The guys will tell you, but the weather may still be pretty bad, so I don't want to get your hopes up just yet."</p> <p>"I'm happy for you Anastasia... I just really wanted a beer."</p> <p>"Well, hang on, I'm going to the bar. I got a tab and the owner is fixing up the place for a special occasion, which is one of the main reasons I bought it up here."</p> <p>Anastasia nodded towards a large black man standing on the door step leading to a small opening in the back of the building. He held out a large business card that had instructions on how to call him to come get it. At the end in a huge white Sharpie, he made a call.</p> <p>"Hi, you're my new girlfriend. Did my friend call? Please, I would really appreciate it if you would come get my new car. It would be a pleasure."</p> <p>He handed her the card, and then opened the door for her. "Come on in. I'll tell my friends to come get your car, and I'd really like to pick up my other car, as well. Please don't say anything while on your way over there. I'd really appreciate it."</p> <p>Anastasia let him lead her into the bar, and he ordered two bottles of wine, and another beer for him. "So, what brings you over here on a Sunday night?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess I was at the bar waiting for you, and then the phone rang."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"I was just wondering if you were still there. I saw you in the bar and I thought, well, you know, I saw you sitting there. I thought you were sitting at the table next to me the other night, and then I saw you sitting at the bar. I thought you were at the bar next to me the other night?"</p> <p>"Well, yeah, when I walked the bar, I noticed it. You know, you were sitting there, sitting next to me, and that made me think that you had a way of sitting next to me at the bar."</p> <p>"Oh, okay. I... I kinda lost my place in line, then. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have..."</p> <p>"You'd been standing like that for over an hour." Anastasia giggled.</p> <p>"Yeah, but I don't do that often, so yeah, it's a nice change." Anastasia giggled some more as she realized her mistake.</p> <p>"You sure look different," Anastasia said.</p> <p>"Yeah, I'm pretty different. It's been a while. I was wearing these short, skinny jeans, and a pair of leather flipflops. That's the kind of thing your old friends wear to the gym, so I've been wearing those since they were inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
