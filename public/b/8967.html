Do you want to go get me a towel? She asked, with that little grin on her face.</p> <p>I just grinned and shook my head no.</p> <p>I picked up a robe off the back of the door and threw it to her, and we headed down to the beach. We talked about what she was up too. We told each other about how we have made our marriage work better than it has in our life, and that is part of why we are having sex right now. I told her that it was important for us to make that marriage better than what we have been through as a couple and make it something else, that we made it that.</p> <p>We talked more about the sex and the loving our marriage has just experienced. She said many times that we have had sex without any condom protection and have both of us orgasming while making love. I didn't even ask how we did. We simply say that we've never had sex without one before. We have talked about doing other things for a while, but never brought it up. We like having sex with each other, but nothing else. We are both married to each other and we are really in love with each other. We were not married to one another, but we had been with other people before we got involved with each other. It happened for some time with only one of us knowing. She said that sometimes if we had a special party or we were in a rush she would be there.</p> <p>This wasn't really new because she was my wife. For instance, we had discussed our sex life before making love. Maybe a little too quickly, at first. But we really went through everything. We have talked about it at length, and I have even started to think that I could have been a more confident lover than she, maybe more so. We had tried all kinds of new things. We had sex with each other. Our sex with other people. She had tried being with two people at once, but it was hard to get used to doing it. We were both virgins when she said that. I was worried. I'm still a virgin. She had the thought that maybe it would be more fun doing it with her, but that was probably against the rules.</p> <p>I told her that she was not to be concerned about making me a virgin, I am really comfortable doing it with someone else just as much as she is doing it to me.</p> <p>"I never would have thought of that," she said, "but I don't care if you have done it with a guy, I don't care. You are the best guy I have ever had."</p> <p>I'm really embarrassed now talking to her like this. I was still a little shocked at what she had said about making a new relationship with a man.</p> <p>"I think we need to talk tonight," I said, "it is really time to get out of here and clean up."</p> <p>We dressed in the bathroom and sat on the bed. I asked her what she had meant, and she said that she had said that it would be ok if we could take the night off again and get together with other people.</p> <p>I kissed her sweetly again before I helped her off the bed. We kissed and she held me to her as I carried her out the door.</p> <p>We drove to the restaurant and she insisted that we have dinner while we were in the car. I was pretty excited at the idea of a "we" and would agree to anything to do with another man. That would be pretty cool, but at the moment and right now all I had is my hand in her crotch.</p> <p>We arrived at the restaurant, and it was crowded. There were a few couples, most of them young or in their fifties or sixties. At one point, there were some people sitting at tables, mostly middle aged and they looked up looking at us with a little smile, but I could tell that they were looking at us with some amusement. There were a few people on the dance floor dancing with each other and even just watching us. Most of the guys were either out of place, or at least looked like they could not keep their hands to themselves.</p> <p>It was really fun. We had brought different food and drinks so we sat around with our heads on the tables facing them. She took the lead for a long time looking at each of us. Our new friends were all really interesting people. We found them all fascinating and interested in every aspect of our marriage and the way we were dealing with them after the first time.</p> <p>She kept talking to me all the time and I kept taking turns saying things like, "How could you possibly be married to someone that does it every night?"
