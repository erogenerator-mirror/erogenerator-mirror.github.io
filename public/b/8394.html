Each time it felt as though she was about to cry, she felt his hand grip one of her nipples in turn and it felt as though someone was making love to it, hard and deep. Their sex was in a constant state of motion and each of them wanted so much more.</p> <p>Kicking off her top to reveal one of her big breasts, she raised her head and began to kiss him while she massaged his engorged cock with her body. When he sucked on one of the erect nipples in his mouth, her hand started to work its way into his shorts once more. He took one of her hands and slid it up to cup one of her large breasts, the nipple hardens under his touch. Pulling on it, he sucked on it and pulled her nipple straight out, eliciting from her what sounded like a growl.</p> <p>She felt completely possessed by him, every fiber of her body throbbed with passion, and as much as she had never wanted anything, it felt as if she could do this without even touching and being touched. She didn't want to give him the satisfaction of seeing it, just the same as he felt. So close, each time she pulled his body towards hers as though she were going to pull him in, his cock would graze the bottom corner of her leg and she would feel him press up against her and her body would react to its contact. Each time he kissed her or held his hands on her breasts, she found her body reacting to its contact. She felt something akin to an electric current between them. Every part of her body was alive with desire and every part could not move. She wanted more. She wanted everything he made her feel.</p> <p>His thrusts were becoming more urgent. He could feel his muscles tightening and he let the tip of one finger trace an outline of her right nipple, while he used the hand that was massaging his cock on her thigh. She moaned. One of his fingers circled the tip of her other nipple and she closed her eyes, the sensation was so strong. When all of a sudden she felt his hand come down against her tummy.</p> <p>"I'm gonna come," he said.</p> <p>"Do it," she said.</p> <p>His body tensed up. He was about to, when she felt his penis twitch and throb against her belly. She started to moan too. His body tensed, she felt him twitch and she knew his seed was going to blast into her. Her body tensed and she screamed as the orgasm surged out of her vagina and into his body. The sensation of their bodies being one, made her tremble in climax and she felt him twitch again, sending a massive surge of pleasure out of the head of his penis down to her vagina and her entire abdomen. Their bodies bucking and trembling for some time as she let him come.</p> <p>Neither one of them said a word as they lay in each other's arms, each breathing deeply, as she held his trembling body to her as the waves of pleasure subsided.</p> <p>When they parted they just stared at each other. Neither of them could explain exactly what they'd just done. It was as though both of them were feeling the electricity of the moment at the same time. All she knew was that she was going to go into the bedroom together and let their bodies be one.</p> <p>She didn't say no, she didn't care one way or the other. There would be time for both of them, and then they could take time to themselves in a way that was neither for their liking nor for theirs. But right now, they both felt it too and knew that there wasn't another way, that other ways were possible, that their lovemaking could be made better.</p> <p>The week passed and by the following Friday, they had decided to get together at the cottage for dinner that weekend. This was the one thing they both enjoyed that she hadn't. It was when they were alone in bed together, or in the same room at night, that things changed. It wasn't at the same time, it was like someone else had stepped right into the room. They were two more lovers than either of them wanted to be. Neither of them would ever feel as though they couldn't touch each other. After all, they were both sexually attractive together, and as such they were willing to try it. The fact was they knew it, and the moment she got over that idea her first reaction would be one of the most thrilling.</p> <p>After dinner, they sat down on the couch in their bedroom and talked. Neither one had a lot in common besides the fact that she had to keep an eye on herself daily. It was hard to watch him every day while thinking of the night they'd be together. He was gorgeous, and she felt she owed him for everything he did. She felt as though she had no need for himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
