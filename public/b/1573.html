It was one of the regulars who always called. She heard a door open, some kind of noise. "Hey it's me." She called. "What's up?"</p> <p>"You never answered." He replied.</p> <p>"I was just about to change channels when he said, "I'm sorry but I forgot that's what your channels are for. I'll let you know."</p> <p>"Oh. No." She muttered, a tear sliding down her cheek. "I'm so sorry."</p> <p>"No don't. Tell me something." He said.</p> <p>"Okay come on up when you're ready. I have a treat for you."</p> <p>"I think the change is in about 20 minutes."</p> <p>"I'll come get you then." He answered. So he took her hand and led her upstairs. Once down the stairs he stopped and looked. Standing under a window, he said, "Here is the first floor bedroom."</p> <p>As the door shut she could hear the door close. She stood and waited as he entered the room. What if? How in the world could it be so simple?</p> <p>He pulled the bedspread down and removed his coat. "Now I'm ready for you to see." He said as he pulled the duvet away from her body. He slid his hand off her shoulder, across her breasts, down her stomach and across to her mound. Her hands went on the bed cover as he slowly rubbed her sex. She wanted to be touched, to moan, to scream, but to silence herself.</p> <p>He leaned down and brushed her breasts with his tongue. Her gasp was barely audible when her eyes closed and she felt a sensation in her groin like heat and pressure. He leaned forward and kissed the lips. He pushed her legs open and began to lick and suckle the lips with his tongue. Her hips started to push forward into his mouth but he pulled away slowly.</p> <p>"I wanted to see you." He whispered. "Don't tell anyone."</p> <p>"No. I'm sure they don't care. They will see." She told him.</p> <p>He continued to suck on one breast, then the other as he reached down her body, under the duvet for his hand came to rest at her groin. She moaned and pushed her body up against his hand. When he pushed his finger into her hole she had a shock of pleasure. "Oh my," she moaned. "Are the girls always so quiet when they cum?"</p> <p>"Nope." He leaned back a little and smiled. "I can always get off when they get a bit excited like this."</p> <p>She reached down and held his hand between her legs, she wanted to do nothing more than feel it on her pussy. At the same time she could hear his heartbeat in her ears, as it seemed to be at a crescendo. A low moan came from her lips as he pulled his fingers from her body. As she turned his fingers around, pulling them into her mouth she could taste herself on them. It was intoxicating. He could tell that she was as excited as he was, she had never been this ready to be fucked. What she didn't know is that she had started leaking a little. As her body quivered in his arms the wetness between her legs started to seep from her body. And it was dripping onto her bed.</p> <p>He helped her up to sit astride him and then she turned to face him. As she lowered herself, slowly, as her juices slid down onto his shaft, he felt his balls tighten in anticipation of his orgasm. He pulled her mouth to his and kissed her. He didn't want her to feel so excited about the evening. He felt her move against him.</p> <p>"Tell me if I'm being too rough." He said. It's okay to do what I want to please you."</p> <p>As she slid herself down onto him, he took hold of her hips and raised her as he plunged himself deeply into her. She began to bounce up and down on him with increasing intensity, it felt as though she was being lifted along his shaft with her breasts swaying side to side. He could feel her body quivering, every muscle in her body was tight. With each bounce, he could also see her eyes close as she was cumming; at the same moment, he could feel himself coming. He could sense her body quivering with passion as they shared the moment.</p> <p>"Are you ready?" He whispered in a hoarse voice.</p> <p>"Oh yes. I'm ready." She whispered as she moved away.</p> <p>"Let's do this some time. Are you sure you are ready to do this?" He asked.</p> <p>"Definitely. But I think I'd rather have more than one orgasmâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
