I walked into the ER and was greeted by the cheerful, very pretty and very cute nurse in a nurse's uniform. This was probably her first ever visit and one that I wished I didn't have to go through.</p> <p>"Good luck to you in your recovery. As soon as you get on your feet, you'll be staying with the parents," she said.</p> <p>"That's great, thanks," I said with tears in my eyes.</p> <p>"It's really late for you," she said.</p> <p>"I'm glad you're okay," I replied.</p> <p>"Let's get you in bed," she said as we got to the bed.</p> <p>I had just started to lay down when the nurse returned to the room with a little more help.</p> <p>"Here you go," she said when she handed me a syringe.</p> <p>"Thank you," she said as she walked out of the door.</p> <p>"My name is Dr. James," she told me.</p> <p>"Hello, Dr. James," I replied.</p> <p>My whole life came to an end that evening at the party where the wedding was being held. I had been trying so hard to find out more about what people were really like in their real lives. Eventually, an empty chair was thrown in my face because my head felt too heavy, so I asked what happened.</p> <p>"I didn't mean to startle you," he said as he sat down. "How do you feel now?"</p> <p>"Okay," I replied.</p> <p>"You're doing better," he laughed. "How's your head? I asked.</p> <p>"Much better," I replied.</p> <p>"How do you feel about your family? Would it be ok if you got married next September?" he asked.</p> <p>"Sure, that sounds great," I replied.</p> <p>"You can just go ahead and marry your parents' son," he said. "We'll take care of you."</p> <p>"Thanks! I'd really like that!" I replied.</p> <p>"How about you?" he answered.</p> <p>"I'd like that! I like that very much!" I replied.</p> <p>"Well, I guess we'd better get you ready for the reception then. Your parents are expecting you to come home at the end of November," he said as he sat down.</p> <p>"I think I'll be okay." I said.</p> <p>"You're doing splendidly," he told me as he continued to sit and watch me.</p> <p>"So I'll be staying with your parents in order to keep their eyes off of you," he continued as he laid his hand on my right shoulder.</p> <p>"No, that won't do!" I replied, as I started to move to get up.</p> <p>"No it won't," he told me. "It won't hurt anyway. It's just me and you right now. All right?"</p> <p>I nodded as I stood up.</p> <p>"No," he said. "It won't."</p> <p>"It won't?" I asked. "Why?"</p> <p>"Well," he began, "it's you and I haven't seen each other much, have we?"</p> <p>"I'm only going out with the family," I told him.</p> <p>"No one's ever invited you to a party," he told me as he looked me over closely. "What if you were to get up and walk away without looking?"</p> <p>"No," I said as I began to walk towards the entrance to the room. "I'm going to get dressed, if that's okay."</p> <p>"Sure!" he replied. "It's nothing."</p> <p>"No it's not!" I yelled out before I stopped and looked at him. "I don't want my parents to know you're going to get married."</p> <p>"Of course you won't!" he said. "You wouldn't want to wait to tell your mom and dad."</p> <p>"No, I won't!" I shouted, as I walked outside with him.</p> <p>"Then I guess I'll go," he replied. "I think I want to go on home."</p> <p>"Okay," I replied as I looked over his shoulder at him.
