It shouldn't have happened at all," I answered.</p> <p>"No, it shouldn't have."</p> <p>"I'm not surprised, baby..."</p> <p>"Yeah, well, I'm glad it didn't. But I hope we can do something together."</p> <p>"Like what, tonight? Just you know. I know you want to and you'll have to be a part of all of this."</p> <p>"I know, I know. I can't be jealous...you're my best friend...I don't want to ruin...what you guys are going out to dinner?"</p> <p>"Yeah, sure. That would be great. And maybe you should just tell the girls you have an important meeting the next week."</p> <p>"Sure. I'll definitely tell them. Okay?"</p> <p>"That's a good girl."</p> <p>"Now, we have about five hours. We'll make plans to go out for dinner. Then I'll be in front of the TV and you'll be sitting on the couch. You need to tell me how you've been getting through your day." She smiled. "And I may know something you'll like."</p> <p>The last thing I needed was to have to go back and tell my girlfriends I had had sex with her when we were out going dancing. I took a long, deep breath. It was good I had found out that my dad was the reason I didn't have any girlfriends. It was good that I had gotten laid by other people as well. What was worse was, my dad was an idiot to have sex with women. And even if he did, I should have had better luck in the sack. Maybe I was hoping he might get me to stay out for the night.</p> <p>Chapter 5</p> <p>I didn't know whether to think about how much I had enjoyed it or whether to wonder if a good thing had happened tonight. I don't think I had even gone as far as to take the trash back into the recycling bin when I had left my phone on the counter, so I would have had my mind blown once I got back here. And to be honest, I had been surprised when I came back out to our room just as the guys had finished leaving. We had been talking about something silly, so I was surprised to find it was getting late. So I sat there in the bed until I got my stuff together, and when I opened the bathroom door I was surprised to see my mom asleep on our bed.</p> <p>"Hey, Mom. Are you okay?" I asked.</p> <p>My mom stirred and then opened her eyes and smiled at me. "Yep, I'm fine. I just heard the shower running," she said, looking over at my mother then back at me. "Is that what I thought it was?"</p> <p>"Uh, mom?" I asked her nervously. "I told you, I was asleep."</p> <p>I could only nod my head sheepishly and stare at my mother. My father had never been very successful in sleeping with women before. He was never interested in girls at all. He just liked playing with my mother. Then his girlfriend and I had gotten naked with the water just right and the first time I had done so, he had felt like he was being fucked by the fishes. I had never felt much shame. I had spent two years of my life sleeping with all the women in my father's life.</p> <p></p> <p>"So, is Daddy awake?" I asked as I sat next to my mother.</p> <p>My mother laughed sarcastically. "Nope, he's not up yet."</p> <p>"Why don't you go get something to eat and we can order something before we leave. I can get you anything," she said.</p> <p>I sighed and got up, heading to the kitchen to make us something to eat. I heard my dad's footsteps coming down the hall as he was getting into his chair. I walked toward the kitchen so he wouldn't hear me, just in case there was a knock on the bathroom door. When I reached the kitchen I found that my dad was still asleep in the chair. I got a glass of milk out of the refrigerator and filled it with water so I could make sure no one was home. When I was done, I went back up to the bedroom. I opened up my nightstand and threw the covers off and found my panties on the floor next to the bed. Now that they were on the floor I started to get up, but my mother's arms pushed me back down onto the bed with my back against the wall.</p> <p>"Not you, my sweet," she began.</p> <p>"No," I gasped between gasps of air. I pulled her into my arms and tried to kiss her. She pushed me back and then sat up.</p> <p>"Hurry, baby, eat me and then make love to me!"</p> <p>I quickly moved downâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
