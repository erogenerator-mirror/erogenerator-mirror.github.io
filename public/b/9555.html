Would she be able to help out or not? It seemed like the least she could do, if she wasn't completely blinded by her selfish desire to be successful in this situation? Would she be successful enough? What if she really made a life of it? What if it ended in her marriage, the children or some other man's heartbreak?</p> <p>That thought kept running through her head. Could she be prepared? She didn't know. What should she do? What would the children do? Or would she just stay in the lifestyle that she found herself in? What?</p> <p>And what about David? What would they do? What did she need? He'd obviously be devastated if she gave in without telling him, but how hard could it be?</p> <p>He had, indeed. How had he ended up in his situation? She'd known from the beginning that there was no "bad" in any relationships. But she had also known that all the other people were far more serious than David. The first step would surely take place in her family. It would probably not be a good plan for her if she stayed in an environment that could easily be considered to be toxic. If she stayed in an environment that involved someone more or less who needed help or advice, why did she go with him?</p> <p>The last thing on her mind was what to do about David. She just had to make sure he didn't get hurt. It had already been over three weeks. If she kept the same rules, then she could avoid some sort of a confrontation.</p> <p>If they stayed out and had sex, no harm could come to any of them. But if she left in the middle of anything, she feared what humiliation he'd deal if they found out. What if he was a complete ass and not as a human being? What if he had a serious disease? What if, by the way that he was treating himself, he wasn't treating his wife? Would she be able to keep to herself and not expose him to any scandal?</p> <p>That thought kept running through her head and she almost immediately changed her mind. It would have to wait until after a night of good food and drinking. But in any event, she didn't have much time before she had to run down the stairs to get ready to leave.</p> <p>She made her way out of the food court, down the hall and out the door. She took off her shirt to help him look over her purchase, then she took off her pants to help him with the money. She grabbed her bag and headed to the front of the restaurant.</p> <p>The meal that David had prepared helped to calm down his nerves. "I'm sorry honey," he mumbled, "you really can't leave all that money."</p> <p>"Of course I can," she chuckled, "I'll pay for your car."</p> <p>She could be very persuasive. He was definitely in no position to argue, that would be in his best interest.</p> <p>They got to the restaurant and David paid, and as he got the bag, he noticed that it was not as neat as it sounded, but that it was not as bad. "It's amazing, "she exclaimed, "and I didn't have to pick your credit card."</p> <p>"Sorry," he replied, "I really didn't think about it. I didn't expect you to buy it for me."</p> <p>"It's alright," she countered, "not all of it is okay."</p> <p>He just grinned. He couldn't deny her. She wasn't beautiful, she wasn't a great model, but she was definitely sexy.</p> <p>"So what are we going to do?" he asked.</p> <p>"Do a little research," she answered.</p> <p>"But how will things go with my boss?"</p> <p>"It could be a good idea," she replied. "I thought that a little less public," she continued, "you could help me with getting my job or..." she said as she reached into the bag that she had found earlier, "get a car back in business."</p> <p>He looked at her blankly. "I don't know," he responded, "let's just keep going."</p> <p>They both decided to go home as it wasn't uncommon for him to feel like he needed some space. Neither of them spoke the rest of the day. She was glad that she had brought along a couple pairs of shoes before she left, and they both had to be careful about where they put their sneakers when they left the stores.</p> <p>She had a couple more shoe stores nearby before the children came over. They spent all day shopping to have the time toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
