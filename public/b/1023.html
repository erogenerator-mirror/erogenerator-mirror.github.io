We were going to the beach, I was going to buy a bunch of presents; we were going to get a boat, then we were going to drive our parents away. It wasn't as simple as either of us wanted it to be. In retrospect I probably would have preferred it to be something more that it was. The second problem, of course, is both my parents knew what a 'semi-slut' she had been back to them. They knew what a 'clit hound' she had been. The girls, the rest, the girls that my Mom had known, knew. How many of my parents knew that I got off on that, that what I was doing was wrong?</p> <p>I was in my bedroom when I heard my father come into the house. He'd had this done for the last few years. I went and got changed in the guest room and got changed in the other bedroom. After I finished that he came into my bedroom and stood over me with a look on his face like he was trying to decide to take a shot. "All right, I'll go," I replied.</p> <p>"Allright," he said again. "But it's none of my business."</p> <p>"I know," I replied, "but I was kind of hoping you'd call and ask."</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>"But I want to do it, too," I added.</p> <p>"That's the spirit," he chuckled. "Okay," he said and walked through the door. He went out of my room and went into hers. They were a couple of steps behind him as he moved.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" I asked him.</p> <p>"Taking my turn," he answered. "With the help of my mom, we'll have her back again sooner than later."</p> <p>"All right. How soon?"</p> <p>He grinned. "The next week or so," he replied. "I was thinking, you know, maybe tomorrow. Maybe on Saturday. Or in the morning, if you feel like."</p> <p>"Whatever."</p> <p>We were on the sand for a long, long time. I thought of the way I had reacted back at the beach, back at the airport, back in the shower, back in the hotel room, and back at the office. It didn't exactly make sense anymore, but I didn't care. We just talked and chatted and kissed and played and laughed. I learned most of what he told me. He wanted to do more than just kiss and cuddle - I learned most of what he had to say. My mother didn't know I was still so upset, so I wasn't too concerned with that, but he did. Our conversation came to an end about halfway through the day. I put on my clothes with no further conversation about what I had done. He'd been right. What did I need to say? What I needed to say? I was a bit embarrassed, not about the whole affair, but about my parents doing the same thing. It had been awkward at the outset. I think I'd just ended the conversation as quickly as it had arisen, but it was the right thing to do and I couldn't have done it otherwise. I said it, then turned my back to him in the mirror as I picked up the top of my dress.</p> <p>"I still think we should go to the beach tomorrow," I said.</p> <p>"Yes," he replied and came over.</p> <p>He started undressing as I watched, still turned off from the kiss, the thought of the evening ahead and the anticipation of what was to come. I felt a little guilty of how I had reacted, but I tried to ignore it. After our clothes were off he leaned over and gave me a quick kiss.</p> <p>"Now the thing," I whispered. "I need you to get it," I said to him.</p> <p>He grinned. He was still naked, but his cock was still hard and bouncing with it. I slipped out of the dress as he lay down and spread himself out on the sand. I climbed on then.</p> <p>"I've got to do my best," I said as I guided the tip of that cock to my cunt. I closed my legs around him.</p> <p>"No, you don't," he said. "You must."</p> <p>I pulled us apart and then started back down. I was so turned on I wanted to make love. This was going to have to be my very last encounter, not to mention my very last night of the rest of my life or so I was thinking. I had no intention of ever getting the chance againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
