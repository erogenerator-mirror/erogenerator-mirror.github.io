If his parents hadn't been around today, he never would have gotten a chance like this. He loved seeing his mother so happy.</p> <p>'God, I love her. She makes me feel like I am old and ugly,' he thought, knowing that she loved the whole package.</p> <p>The next day she started preparing breakfast. She would be home from school on Thursday. She wanted to be there that time. She also wanted to be home from school by lunchtime.</p> <p>"Oh no, let me get that first thing!" she called out, as she put the sausage roll in a bowl in the microwave.</p> <p>"What is the rush today mom?" Matt said.</p> <p>"Oh you know, I'm just going to be at home watching the football game I guess," she said.</p> <p>She went to the fridge to get a drink of water, while he grabbed three orange juice. They had made small talk about the evening before. She told him how beautiful she thought his mother would be. She even had to try on a few times to make sure she looked okay. That always gave him a hard time.</p> <p>When Matt got home on Saturday, he immediately sat down to watch the game. Even though he had only been watching football, it was something that had been forgotten from his life.</p> <p>Matt went to the fridge to get a bottle of beer and opened it. When he got back to the living room, mom was reading while reading the newspaper. He noticed she had a look of relief on her face when she had the paper out of her hand, but she didn't say anything to him.</p> <p>He sat down across from her and looked at her reading the paper. She had obviously picked up on the fact that his father had been a cop in the past. From the way he wrote, her father was a detective working tirelessly to solve every crime.</p> <p>He looked at her a while longer when he noticed that she had fallen asleep on her side by then. She didn't even look at him.</p> <p>"So mommy looks up at you. Is that true?" he teased.</p> <p>"Well sweetheart, do you know I don't look up at you?" she laughed.</p> <p>"No, but you do make me uncomfortable. I mean how would I ever be with you around," he said, trying hard to hide his anger for being so young.</p> <p>"Matt, I am not an old woman," she said as she sat up.</p> <p>He laughed, but didn't answer her. "No wait. You don't look old. You look like a twenty something," he said to her.</p> <p>"I'm twenty-six," she yelled at him. "And I'm not old. I feel young. I feel young," she yelled back.</p> <p>"But mom...." he said, trying to get back to the game.</p> <p>"Matthew, you don't hear me saying anything to you. I like to call you my handsome son," she said in her most seductive voice.</p> <p>"Well that just sounds so...oh so old," he mumbled.</p> <p>She laughed and looked up at him. "Matthew, I know how old you must think I am," she said.</p> <p>"No don't say that," he said.</p> <p>"No I'm just trying to explain to you that there is no age limit in regards to the legal age of consent in my state," she said to him.</p> <p>"Mom, that's ridiculous. You are my mother," he said.</p> <p>"So there is no age limit, is there?" she said laughing, but continued, "It's just the way I was raised. I didn't know if that would be the case until you came along," she said.</p> <p>"Mom, I don't think that is even a legal age," he said.</p> <p>"I think it would be silly to be concerned," she said. "And so far, I am not having any of that. Do you agree with that?" she said to him, now sounding excited.</p> <p>"Yes mom, I agree with all of that," he said to her.</p> <p>"I'll see you at school," she said.</p> <p>As she finished her lunch she said," Oh and Matt, if I get to go first, I'll really be excited if you are."</p> <p>"Sure mom, I understand. I never thought that you would be interested in going there," heâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
