She leaned forward and began kissing the head of my cock. The softness of her lips were so erotic. I almost blew my load right then.</p> <p>"Mmm...your hands, like I always do." she said, grinning.</p> <p>She moved back and put her arms around me. It was a simple soft gesture, but the sheer passion she showed was almost overwhelming. She kissed the base of my cock, then leaned forward and took it in her mouth. I could feel I had come already, so I was not far under her control as we continued kissing. She kissed the tip of my cock before sliding her lips down the shaft. Her tongue flicked around it several times, and her head bobbed up and down on my cock, never taking it out of her mouth. She took me back into her mouth. God, I loved the way she began to suck on my cock, her lips sliding up and down it.</p> <p>I reached down and pulled her up my body, and we lay on the cool bathroom floor. She was facing the wall and I leaned forward and began running my hands up and down her stomach, her breasts in my hands. I kneaded them and slid a hand inside her robe, cupping her breasts. I took a nipple between my fingers and softly rolled it as I kissed and nibbled them. She moaned as she turned her head to the side and began sucking on my nipples again.</p> <p>She began kissing her way down my body, her lips never leaving. She kneeled before me and began unbuckling my robe. She pulled it off, tossing it to the floor. She grabbed my cock and began stroking it, squeezing it as she kissed her way down to the base. She licked from my balls to my wet, throbbing head. This time, she took my cock deep into her mouth, and sucked hard.</p> <p>I groaned as she looked up at me and she slowly took my cock into her mouth, taking it as deep into her throat as she could. I looked down at her perfect little cock, it was so big and hard as it pointed straight at me.</p> <p>"Christ, you are so good," I said as I looked at her. My legs were shaking and I was close to the breaking point. She looked up at me, and I knew what was coming. I took her head in my hands and slid it down, taking my cock back up her throat. She went faster, and suddenly began moving her hips in time with my strokes.</p> <p>"Oh, God, I am going to come!" I said suddenly, thrusting forward as far as I could. She continued to suck on my cock, moving her hips as much as she could, sucking hard. My cum flew out, shooting into her mouth and onto the ground. I could not contain it as I thrust in and out of her mouth, my cum continuing to stream from my cock.</p> <p>We lay there, with my cock still in her mouth, for a few minutes before she moved. She stood up and took my face in her hands, pressing her lips hard against mine. Our lips locked, and for a moment, I just laid my head on hers.</p> <p>"Was that okay?" she asked me after a half breath.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah," I said, kissing her again.</p> <p>"If I would have known what your feelings were about me," she said, "I would have fucked you in the past months."</p> <p>"You didn't have to do this," I said.</p> <p>"Well," she said, "there is one thing I would like to do to you. And if we don't do this, I will leave you alone."</p> <p>I was not in control, and for one last moment, I believed my words. I pulled her to me, then reached for her robe. She lifted her arms as I held her robe closed. I undid the knot on her robe and dropped it to the floor. She was naked, except for her heels. I grabbed her by the waist, pulling her to me and her towards the shower.</p> <p>The shower was large and the water was hot. The cold was almost scary as I turned her around. She bent forward, supporting her weight with one hand on the shower wall for support. I reached down and stroked her ass. She pushed herself on her hands.</p> <p>"I have wanted to fuck you," I said.</p> <p>"I want to fuck you all night, honey," she said, pulling my cock from her mouth.</p> <p>"This is not the time for that," I laughedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
