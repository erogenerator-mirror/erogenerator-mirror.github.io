But I've never been with them in a sexual way. Well, never been with a women in a non-sexual way. So when I think about doing this with a woman that I know will want me to play with her, I just get the feeling that it might not always be that way for me. Then, when I'm back at home, just once, I'll find out that she's never been with men. I don't think that is such a bad thing. It's the same way I feel about other girls. Even if I'm not bi-sexual, I also enjoy seeing other's bodies that I like and they may like and I'll get them into the same mood I am. The fact that it is not always about a guy and how to handle guys is not in my interest. It is more about the actual experience of doing something and making it happen. I have, in fact, had quite a few experiences with different sex partners. My girlfriend used one of men in the apartment I shared with her and, after a few seconds, the man I was with pulled out of her. We kept our secret to ourselves. If something really did happen in a room of different people and the other didn't know it, he would stop. I'm guessing she had had a few experiences with a number of different men and I wouldn't be surprised if she had been with some of the men at another party. Just to be safe, she didn't tell me about the other partners. Her first sex partner only wanted to watch since he wanted to hear and so she let him have her again. I'm guessing, however, she had only wanted one other guy at a party and I'd bet I was the only one that told the other person."</p> <p>"Then, I felt more confident that I could enjoy doing this with a woman, even if she seemed like her sexual being was a challenge." I thought to myself. "But, then she wouldn't have been able to tell anything of what I would have wanted done to her."</p> <p>"That's an interesting theory, because the female sexuality just doesn't do a lot of things with a man," Sarah laughed. It seemed to be a natural response to how Sarah was speaking.</p> <p>"I'm sorry, I'm not sure how much I should be saying. I felt compelled to tell you this and, I think that's the best way to take it."</p> <p>"Actually, I think it's actually quite sweet," Sarah smiled. "And even just for a moment, I wonder if we really are lovers? If it was really just a sex thing, then I never would have thought that it would be about. But, as far as I'm concerned, I still liked doing this with you."</p> <p>"Thank you. I feel that strongly about being with you, too, not just with the sexual aspects of it."</p> <p>"I like how you feel, too," Sarah grinned, "and, I really did like you not asking me to do that."</p> <p>I looked at the two of them and then I stood up and pulled her to me. There was one issue that I didn't quite know about. "Sarah, I just don't see how any of this could ever be the same for you and for me, at least not this quickly."</p> <p>"Oh, Dave, it's not that easy for me. Besides, the person that I loved most in that whole world is still here. Now, I know how that feels." She pulled me to her and she kissed me. Then, she kissed my neck as she began to unbutton my shirt. I was getting concerned. "Wait. Let me see what I have to offer you to do while we are here on that flight home."</p> <p>She helped me out of my shirt and bra and then knelt on the side of the bed. She pulled off my shoes and socks and then she helped me undress. When I was down to my boxers, I had difficulty breathing. She helped me sit back into the chair.</p> <p>"Dave, I don't know you well enough to know how to have sex with another man. I just don't know that it's okay or fun to me to try without asking you first. But, please don't assume that I'll want to make the first move." "Of course not."</p> <p>"I'm going to tell you, though. If that's just because I'm feeling that way about you, then I'm pretty sure I can't just ask you to do the same thing with me that you just did to another guy," Sarah said. "And I can't really be your first guy. But, I'll try."</p> <p>"I'm pretty sure that you're pretty sure that you can do that," I said. "It was just that I was curious about this.
