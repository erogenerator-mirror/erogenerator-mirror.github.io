Just relax." I told her. "I'm sorry, my hand is shaking so bad, I just wanted to wipe it up."</p> <p>"Don't worry, it's fine." She replied, brushing herself off and kissing me.</p> <p>We had a good time together the next couple of hours and we really got into it again. We finished eating and took a break and went into the living room. I was sitting with my back against the back of the sofa and Heather sat between my legs on my lap as she bent over, kissing me. I was slowly massaging her ass and she squirmed a little on my lap.</p> <p>"What do you plan to do if I sit with you?" she asked me, giggling, and I responded, "Like you don't."</p> <p>"I don't think I'll mind. It makes me feel warm all over, but I just don't think it would feel that good."</p> <p>"It's not that good." I told her. "You're so... soft, and... and... sexy."</p> <p>"Mmhmm, that sounds good." She said, as she got off my lap then sat next to me on the sofa, facing me. I moved closer to her and gave her a quick kiss.</p> <p>"Your turn." I told her, kissing her neck and running my hand down her chest.</p> <p>My hand was now down her shirt and she had one arm across my head and was still running her hand up and down my chest, and I ran my hand over her bra, and ran the palm up to her left breast and softly cupped it in my hand and started rubbing it. She moaned and leaned back against me, pressing herself against me, letting me know it was okay. I could feel her nipples getting hard, and her breathing getting heavier at the feel of me being close to her. I unbuttoned her shirt fully and felt her breasts as I pulled it out of the opening, and pulled the lacy black bra straps down her arms, exposing them to my touch.</p> <p>I started kissing them on the lips and started rubbing her nipples with my thumb and forefinger. She closed her eyes and moaned softly. I went back to kissing her deeply and slowly, so I was enjoying it as well. I worked one of her boobs into my mouth, and used one hand to pull her towards me while the other went down between us and played with her clit, playing like musical notes in her sex. She was now pressing her pussy into my thigh and we were just starting to get into it.</p> <p>I felt her hand moving over to my dick and she was stroking it through the fabric of my boxers. "Can you do this with my pants on?" she asked, with a cute grin.</p> <p>"Sure" I answered, and started to rub her crotch, moving my hand inside the leg of her panties, and feeling her pubes and clit through the fabric.</p> <p>"Do you want me to do something else about that too?" she asked.</p> <p>"Sure." I answered, still stroking her crotch.</p> <p>"Can I... have you do anything?" she asked, in her sexiest voice.</p> <p>"Absolutely." I answered. I pushed her down and sat back, pulling her panties down over her hips and off. My fingers were now stroking her clit and she was grinding her crotch harder into my thigh.</p> <p>"Oh, god I'm about to cum." she moaned, starting to move her hips rhythmically against my fingers. As she was going up and down on my lap, I got up on my knees and pushed her down so she was lying on the floor, kissing her again. Her hands went to the back of my head, and she started stroking my hair and neck and face, encouraging me to take her. I put my hand on her ass, and pulled it over and under, playing with her soft, smooth skin all over.</p> <p>"I'm... going to... going to cum." Heather said in a raspy voice.</p> <p>"Me too." I answered.</p> <p>Without slowing down, I slipped my hand down between us and up into her shorts and through her wet sex. I could feel her opening, and I rubbed up against her inner folds while continuing to rub them in and out. With the head of my dick, it looked like it was about an inch apart from her clit, but the other wayside was wider, so I continued the pressure on her sex and watched her face as she enjoyed my touch. It was almost like her eyes were going off into a trance or something, like she was watching a movie with her mouth open, so I felt good about what I was doing, really. I looked down at her faceâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
