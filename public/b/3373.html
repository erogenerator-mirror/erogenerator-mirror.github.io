I asked him.</p> <p>"No," he said sheepishly with a slight smile on his lips, "I'm just glad to be free again. I'm just happy to be working on my own."</p> <p>"That's good, Jake," I said to see if he was feeling any better, "And it looks like you have just started to get a little more relaxed."</p> <p>I told him that it just felt so wonderful when I had him cumming in my mouth. It was so satisfying that even the feeling of it had a negative effect on his orgasm.</p> <p>I looked down at him and said, "Now, Jake... I want you to get on your knees... and pull your pants down as far as you can."</p> <p>He hesitated a bit before he slowly and carefully turned around. His penis was hard and glistening from the work that he had just put in earlier. I could see the moisture running down onto the tops of his legs, but he seemed more comfortable with his pants off. So, once he had removed his pants I told him to wait. I stood close to him and leaned over the top of him so that he did not have to look in my direction for long. He reached up his hands and I helped him pull them down as far as they would go. He quickly stood up, still looking in my direction, and then reached out and grasped his hardness. Using his hands I began to lightly stroke him, just like he did to me.</p> <p>I leaned forward and kissed the tip of his cock on the tip. I looked up to see if it was hard as a rock and smiled. I continued and was pleased to see that my hand was quickly growing soft and very warm.</p> <p>I leaned back in my chair and looked at Jake with an inquiring look. I told him I wanted him to feel as well as he felt, so he dropped to his knees and bent forward. He was very eager to get him completely inside my mouth.</p> <p>He slid almost the rest of his 8 inches all the way in. He had a soft and warm, wet mouth. I could not take all of him in and felt that it would not help. But I really had to get him in farther. I had one hand holding him in place while I used the other to run a finger along his perineum. My finger traced the tiny line of his prostate over his entire area of pleasure and he was writhing and moaning with abandon.</p> <p>He pushed his hips forward slightly, trying to push more of himself into my mouth, but I resisted for a bit so I could move forward until the tip of his penis was in between my lips and just the swollen end. For some reason this caused me to hesitate for a moment. This seemed odd, but I wanted to continue working him as much as he was giving me. I reached up with my hand and gently wrapped it around the shaft. Then I started to slowly move my hand up and down the underside of his shaft and he followed suit.</p> <p>"Oh, yesssss, Jake. That feels so good," I whispered in his ear, "Let me show you what you have been missing."</p> <p>He still wouldn't move. He didn't want to try and take me in deeper. I wanted him to feel as good as I did, but I wanted him to relax and just let himself go with a few soft strokes. I decided that I could go further than that, so I removed his hand and reached down and started to run my fingers through his pubic hair.</p> <p>"Yesssss... that feels wonderful." He said.</p> <p>He began to move his hips in small circular motions, which I appreciated. I did not have very much of him in my mouth, but I was feeling very good at the moment so I decided to make use of it.</p> <p>Taking my hand away from his penis I said, "OK, Jake, come up here. Lie down on your back."</p> <p>His face was serious and he was holding his breath with a look of relief and anticipation that made me smile.</p> <p>"Let me know if you feel awkward moving around, but be assured that I have just taken what seemed like a lot of him into my mouth."</p> <p>The look on his face was priceless. He could not believe that I had just done that.</p> <p>At least I was not a big fan of being the expert in this respect. I decided to continue in my current position, so I put my feet up and hooked them around his thighs. He had now sat up slightly so that he could grab the headboard and support himself. He wrapped his arms around my lower back and held tight to me and I could feel his penis begin to move within me.</p> <p>I moved a bit to make room until I felt his bottom and it was very slick against me. Then I wrapped my arms around him and hugged himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
