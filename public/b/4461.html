We're only going to be ten minutes away."</p> <p>"Okay!" I agreed, and they went back into the kitchen. I returned to my room in seconds and was suddenly very afraid of what was next, for in less than a minute I had changed my mind.</p> <p>To say I looked forlorn was the understatement of the term. I sat in my room and began to sob. I cried it off, I cried it over and over and over again. My sobs were muffled by the bedsheets and eventually stopped. As the sounds came to an end there was that feeling again, one where I wanted nothing more than to be there.</p> <p>After what seemed like an eternity they came into the room and I heard them go through to the kitchen as if I was a statue. I lay there breathing slowly as I felt a calm sweep over me. I lay there thinking "I don't deserve him." I wasn't thinking of a love life, what was I thinking? My arms reached out to my own sides but they were still wrapped about me. I looked up and saw that he was standing there looking at the bed. He was holding his cock in one hand and my breasts in the other, his other hand was holding on to my back and pressing me tightly to him. He pushed himself against my side and then he pulled me so that I was leaning on both sides of the bed as he sat close to me. My head was up against his chest and I could feel his cock pressing against my hip. I could feel every ridge on it, every vein, and every thick vein under the skin. My legs were spread just enough that the bottom of my stockings were between the top of my stocking and his thigh. He reached around me with his other hand and then took hold of my breast which I thought was about to pop out. I couldn't stand it and closed my eyes in a self-inflicted shudder of ecstasy.</p> <p>"What's wrong?" he said as he took hold of my other breast and I felt his thumb brush on my nipple.</p> <p>"This, I, we..." I stammered, "this's wrong." My hands were on his chest and he put his hands on mine to steady me.</p> <p>"Let me make you happy," he told me, gently pinching my nipples between his thumb and forefinger.</p> <p>"Oh God, please...I want to be free."</p> <p>"Nonsense," he said as he lifted one breast away from my body and sat up. He looked down at me. His cock was hard and throbbing against my hip and I saw it pulsing. He gently pulled on the neckline of my nightie and I felt its straps slide off my back to fall onto the bed. He looked at my breasts with a devilish smile before reaching for the other breast with a little more grace and power as he held them for me. He pulled me back down so that his cock slid down between my legs. It felt so good, so good in fact that it was hard to believe I was aroused. I could feel his breath on my neck and it sent small shivers through me.</p> <p>He lifted one breast up slowly to his mouth and I let him do what he wanted with it for a moment. His mouth covered both of my breasts and the feeling of his mouth on each one was wonderful. I was feeling a twinge of pleasure and he had his mouth on my breast, not as firmly it was with his mouth but just enough so that I could feel it.</p> <p>"Fuck me," I told him. "I can feel you're hard."</p> <p>He lifted himself just enough so that he could position his cock in front of my opening and then he pushed himself firmly against me and leaned over me so that his face was in front of mine. Just then I felt that incredible sense of touch, of being held in the arms of someone who knew how to make love to you like you knew how to make love to him. We kissed for a moment and then he lifted his mouth away and looked directly into my eyes.</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Fuck yes," I said, "please?"</p> <p>He smiled slightly and then quickly moved his body away. He moved to the bed and gently pulled me down to the bed, lying between my parted legs. When he laid my head back I looked up at him and saw the way he'd come. He was wearing only his cock, his hairless chest and legs, his pubes shaved bare at the very base of his cock pointing straight up at me. I looked up at him before he looked back down at me.</p> <p>"Are you sure you want to do this? I can help," he said.</p> <p>Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
