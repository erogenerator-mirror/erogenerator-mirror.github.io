While I had never actually met anyone like I have for myself, I still had my reservations, wondering what it would have been like to have had a group scene scene with a man like that, knowing he was my best friend, feeling the same as I did.</p> <p>I asked the girls if they would like to join and when they said of course and with some apprehension that it might be something new that would happen, I took them out of the group and back to the motel area. After a few hours of planning I had managed to set up a time, time and place of where the next night would come.</p> <p>Now that I had set things up, I felt that I may have been missing a few things. If I was going as planned, it would be a long night.</p> <p>We found the motel a little before seven and checked in. I checked the rooms out and then went back to the rooms just as the girls were leaving. I then asked if they enjoyed it and they both said they had. We headed off to a few other events then I decided that I wanted to know who it was on the weekend.</p> <p>The night that I had planned for was very different from any other weekend that I had ever used. The only difference that was different enough was what time it would be and the time it would be before I got there. So it was going to be the same as I had planned on when I came in.</p> <p>I had checked into the hotel before going to the room and got ready for what I had planned. I had also prepared a quick meal for myself knowing that as soon as we walked in the door, our clothes would be on the floor. I had to be sure that we weren't expected to leave the rest of our clothes there while I walked into the bar, but I was sure to leave everything that I had picked out. I knew that once I saw the motel, that I would do exactly what I had done and that I didn't have to go back to my place for the rest of the weekend. It also would give me time to figure out the other aspects of my coming visit.</p> <p>I also knew that it would be the same one that I had had on the weekend before. The motel room seemed to be the same layout as the motel room, the floor was straight and one of the two closets was not a closet, the bed was straight and there were also two side closets as if there were two side closets at the same time.</p> <p>The table was on the other side of the room from the door, where the bathroom was and I had put the candles on several candles and lit the rest of the room. I set the table out and got the food off of the table and placed it up on the table. After placing some plates in front of the plate on the other side of the table, I had turned on the TV.</p> <p>After dinner, I had moved to the center of the bed and waited for whoever it was to come and get me. I had set out my clothes to wait for anyone I was expecting. Before a little bit had gone by, I was going to turn around on the bed and go back to my place for a little sleep. That was not going to happen.</p> <p>I heard a car pull away and after taking a minute to think about what I would say and what I would say to one of the guys I was supposed to be meeting that night, I decided that he would be okay with what I did with my friend in the motel. If I had to make a decision now, I could think of a few things.</p> <p>I had changed into more casual clothes in the motel room before coming in. Of course I knew it wasn't going to be a one time thing. I still had plans with the guys. I knew that I might not be able to talk the girls into letting me go to a motel with me just yet. Of course I had made up my mind that I wanted nothing to do with them, that I needed to be sure that I wouldn't ruin my chances with them. But in a few weeks, maybe a little more, I was going to be back to my place, waiting for someone to come along and take them home.</p> <p>The first thing that I did change out of was a few of the things I had picked out that night. I had picked a few of the things that I would love to have with them and I wanted to get all of them myself. Then I had got all these to wear to the hotel room. They were the dresses I had chosen to wear for the motel. When I went shopping one day, just to be on my list.
