My body responded instantly and I groaned as the first wave swept through me. I was vaguely aware of my legs pulling me forward when the second wave exploded out. I screamed my pleasure into my pillow as orgasm flooded me. His tongue worked at me, his fingers worked my clit and his lips suck and lick my pussy like some kind of demented animal. My body thrashed as I came hard, his fingers continued to play at my g-spot as he licked me and my body twitched with every orgasm.</p> <p>When I had finally stopped trembling, he climbed up beside me and kissed me deeply.</p> <p>"I want you so damn bad, but I've got to take a quick shower," he said after we'd settled down.</p> <p>"I agree, but in time, in time."</p> <p>"I'll see you later, sweetheart. Later. Right now, I want a nice glass of wine. I haven't had time to take a cab home. I'm sorry."</p> <p>"I'd hate for you to be upset with me."</p> <p>Saying that, he grinned and pulled me close and kissed me as he held me. "Let's take a shower. And you can take your clothes off before we even get in the shower."</p> <p>"Ohhhh. I'll need more time than that before it's even worth my time."</p> <p>He smiled, got dressed and pulled on his clothes as the shower started.</p> <p>I got out of bed a little after he got dressed and started to pull on my robe and when he came out of the bathroom, he smiled and said, "I guess I'm the same as always; only better."</p> <p>I couldn't help but laugh as he said that. It just made me happy. I gave him a cheeky smile, pulled my robe down over my shoulders and walked out the door, letting him watch me as I walked, feeling a little embarrassed. As we got to the street, he gave me a smile and said, "I don't suppose you ever did take a cab before, did you?"</p> <p>"No," I admitted, but I'm sure it felt the same thing we were doing the first time we came home, but that didn't bother me. "I had a boyfriend who I dated for a while, but it was kind of a waste of time. I don't really get off on sex." "It's really sexy. I don't mean you don't like to kiss and make out, but you really don't have to. If you had a friend, you'd be on the pill."</p> <p>"It's the other side of the law. Do you know what I mean?"</p> <p>"No. But yes, I hear what you say, and yes it's sexy stuff."</p> <p>"Oh no, I know what all we are talking about. I just want you to know it means a lot to me."</p> <p>"Well, I love it. You're gorgeous, smart and funny, and there's no sense in keeping secrets from you."</p> <p>"You're not the first guy I've had in there tonight. And that was only one date. There's a lot more. And you're the guy that makes me feel special in so many ways. My first time on top, you came for me."</p> <p>"I love that name."</p> <p>"You did. And you know it. I'm glad you came for me."</p> <p>"You're just saying that to tease me while I'm being as stupid as you are. I was supposed to come home for coffee, or some food, or something. And you were going to fuck me. You're the one who made me feel special last night, and I'm sure you're the one that made me feel that way again."</p> <p>I could see a bit of truth in his eyes, but I wasn't too happy after the way he'd behaved when we went to bed, but he said a friendly hello anyway and kissed me gently, as if he were comforting me for something I needed. I think he thought I was more excited about making love to him than myself.</p> <p>He started his car and we drove off, hand in hand. We got out of the car and I felt the excitement of the night before and the anticipation of what was ahead. I knew my lover loved me like no woman ever had. This time, I felt like I belonged to him, in many ways. For the first time in so very long I felt comfortable. We got onto the main street, headed toward the courthouse, and I was ready to be on my way home. I hadn't expected to see him just yet, but I thought he'dâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
