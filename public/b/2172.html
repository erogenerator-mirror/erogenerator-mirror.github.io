I just couldn't seem to get near to you or anything as you were so close."</p> <p>I turned my head around and looked at him and said, "So what was it you wanted? Something you said?"</p> <p>"Yes," he said.</p> <p>"What was it?" I asked.</p> <p>"I wanted you to look at me like I was a person. That's all it is."</p> <p>"I don't know what you're talking about," I said.</p> <p>He grabbed me around the waist and carried me back in the direction I was going. He carried me the same way I had the first night we ever had. His lips were on mine as he held me like a child holding his mother's leg. My mouth opened and I kissed him back. His hands were feeling all over my body and he took each of them in one of my hands and started caressing them as we kissed harder and harder. Our tongues were dancing in each other’s mouth. I had never felt such pleasure as I just moments before and it felt so good. He brought his hands down and he started rubbing my breasts through my clothing. I pulled his shirt up to a point that it just barely covered my left breast and he just stared at me as he undid a button. When his right hand reached my waist, he pulled off my shirt and started kissing all over my body. When the shirt was off he looked at me with fire in his eyes and kissed me one last time. As his tongue slid down my body his hand grabbed my breast from behind and squeezed it gently.</p> <p>"Come on baby, we have to take this to work," he said. And I could tell by the look in his eyes that he really did really want to. There was no way out of it if I agreed too. He pulled me to the bedroom and threw me down on the bed, and with one push, put me on my back.</p> <p>His lips never left mine as his hands continued to caress my body. I could smell the scent of his skin that was so hot in the room and it excited and excited me even more. His mouth found my nipples again and I grabbed at his hair to pull his head closer to my chest. When my nipple popped free, he grabbed it with a slow hand and twisted it. With a moan, my body convulsed in reaction. I grabbed him by his hair again and pulled him closer. I bit my lip as the feeling hit me again. His hand slid up my stomach to my belly button. He rubbed it lightly and it sent shivers through me again.</p> <p>"You are so fucking hot," he said.</p> <p>"I'm hot from your lips on mine," I responded.</p> <p>Once the words were uttered, he dropped his mouth on mine again and he kissed me ever so intensely.</p> <p>"I want you so badly," I said between kisses.</p> <p>"I'm not sure how long we will be together," he said.</p> <p>"Do you want to go back to that same night?" I asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, but I have a few other things I want to do for you," he said.</p> <p>"What would you like to do?"</p> <p>"I'd love you to come over again right now," he said.</p> <p>His lips went back to mine. Before I could reply, he rolled on top of me and slowly made his way down my body, stopping every now and then to make sure that each area belonged to him. When he finally found my pussy, he kissed it, tasting it once again. He took his tongue and started to work it around the outside.</p> <p>"I can't believe how good your tongue felt inside me," I said.</p> <p>"My tongue works differently with you?" he responded.</p> <p>"Yes, my tongue works with you and I could feel when it touched your finger so you got me excited."</p> <p>"This was so fucking hot. Was it as good as the other night?"</p> <p>He ran his tongue down my slit and my legs automatically wrapped around his waist. He started to lick and suck my clitoris which had taken up all of my attention before but my body wanted more.</p> <p>"I couldn't believe that I just let you do this," I said.</p> <p>With that, he started eating me again. He didn't spend as long on my pussy as he did earlier, since there was no reason to go on so long after we had already had sex. When he ran his tongue all over my pussy, it felt like heaven.</p> <p>"You are so wet," he said.</p> <p>"I'm glad you like it," I said, with a smile playing across my face.</p> <p>He pulled off my boxers and ran his tongue along my—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
