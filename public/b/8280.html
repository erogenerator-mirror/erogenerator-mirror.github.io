He promised as he put on the sweatshirt and jeans he had borrowed from the store.</p> <p>"I'll try for you!" Katie cooed as she picked up the shopping bag.</p> <p>He followed her back out onto the porch.</p> <p>"Now, where do you think we're going?" He asked with a smile.</p> <p>"Just sit and watch me move this place out. You'll see."</p> <p>"It's kind of a mess though. Can we go shopping?" He teased as he closed the door on the porch.</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>As they walked the rest of the way, he opened up the bags and found several pieces.</p> <p>"Would you like to try them all?"</p> <p>"No! I want to shop. We can wait." Katie said.</p> <p>"Ok. We can try and get the rest of yours, if you mean me!" he smiled as they entered the house.</p> <p>"I'm sure we'll both enjoy. Oh, and by the way..." he finished, "I just wanted to warn you that there are a few things in here you might want to see if you want to go into town with me!"</p> <p>"Oh yeah? Are you sure about that?" She asked.</p> <p>"Absolutely!" He said eagerly.</p> <p>She picked up the bags.</p> <p>"These are not much. They're very nice!"</p> <p>"Thanks! I'll be glad to help!"</p> <p>Katie went up to the bedroom. He saw the bed from time to time as she undressed. He noticed a light coming from the bathroom through the open door and hoped she hadn't had to strip.</p> <p>After she had stripped, he got up and stripped off his own clothes.</p> <p>"So, I guess we've got time for one more thing! Do you want me to undress or should I undress?" He asked with his hands at the ready.</p> <p>"Let's do both together!"</p> <p>"Ok. Now we'll do it here!"</p> <p>He took his own shirt off and she took her own. They smiled at each other as they put on the shirts.</p> <p>He grabbed the shoes he had brought and walked over to her. She took her own pants off while he grabbed a new shirt. He slipped one back on and then followed her into the bathroom. He pulled her toward him and they embraced. "I love you Katie. This is so wonderful. No other man could get me happier than you." He kissed her.</p> <p>"I love you too. We'll do the same. This will be a once in a lifetime event." She smiled.</p> <p>He undid his own pants, took her hands, and pulled her down into the water. They kissed again and she helped him off the wet shirt and then followed his lead. They splashed and laughed together in the water before they both stripped too.</p> <p>He took the bottom so they could wash each other.</p> <p>"I need to make us a new place!" He joked.</p> <p>"That's all right. I'm sure we can be together this much longer!" She smiled.</p> <p>They kissed again before he picked her up and carried her out of the tub. They dried each other off while he carried her bags into the bedroom and laid her down on the bed. They snuggled together and snuggled together, spooning, a lot.</p> <p>"Honey, I want to tell you something. I'm very attracted to you but I'd even better make it special. I always wonder what it's like to be with a virgin." He said.</p> <p>"I'm not going to say I'm not attracted to you. We just haven't had that much time together in a long time. I don't want to scare you away. I just want you to have me for a change!" She said.</p> <p>"You already have me!" he agreed.</p> <p>"What made you decide I'm not going to show you?" She asked.</p> <p>"Let's not think about it. Just have fun! I've got lots of time and I'll be happy to do things for you!"</p> <p>"Good! Then we'll see!"</p> <p>He lay down beside her and she snuggled up close.</p> <p>"Tell me when you go to sleep!"</p> <p>"OK. I'll probably go to sleep in the middle of the night. How about you? I'll sleep right beside you." He said hopefully.</p> <p>"Good! I'm usually safe. I sleep with you." She said.</p> <p>"We'll see. But we'll only do it with you here. I'll be sleeping beside you when I get up!"</p> <p>"You're a gentleman!"</p> <p>"No, I wasn't!
