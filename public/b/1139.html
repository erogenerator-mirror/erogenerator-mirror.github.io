Can I see it?"</p> <p>She stood there completely naked in her garden, her firm breasts with nipples standing firm and erect. The bikini top and bikini bottoms were discarded on the cold ground. She turned slightly to the left to see the full-length garden through her windows.</p> <p>"Have a look!"</p> <p>"I can't help myself, so I'm not very brave."</p> <p>"We don't have to do anything"</p> <p>"Just let me get back into the house."</p> <p>"No"</p> <p>"Oh no, I was just thinking that I just can't stop thinking of you" she paused again and ran her finger across her breasts "I love looking at you, and I couldn't help it if I wanted to."</p> <p>She sat down on the grass and opened the front door so that she could get dressed. She put back on her sandals and ran her fingers over her body again. She then slowly opened her door and stepped outside. From there she turned to see the lovely view of the water down the side of the village building. The sunlight from the open window reflected warmly on her lovely body from behind. She walked back to the cottage knowing that she had to keep her mind on her job.</p> <p>Chapter 2</p> <p>After taking a shower the next morning, the first thing that Sophie wanted to do was get dressed. Then she remembered that she had to get dressed. She went to the full-length mirror just to be sure. When she saw that she couldn't see any more black panties; that could be mistaken for one. Then she put on a white dress.</p> <p>In her hurry to get dressed, Sophie couldn't see anything. But, she did catch a glimpse of the string hanging from the back of her dress. The string stopped just below the hem line, and it looked like a bikini. Then she pulled her hands into a large handbag. She pulled up her dress and adjusted it to cover her thighs and the top half of her breasts. She put her dress on in silence and followed the house to the next door on the left.</p> <p>"Hmmm...." was all she could say as she rang the bell. There was a long pause, she didn't even acknowledge it. She heard footsteps on the carpeting and then footsteps on the other side. Sophie went over to the door and opened it for her husband, "Come in" she said. He took hers and she shut the door. "Oh what a lovely morning you're making."</p> <p>"Yes, it has been a very strange one."</p> <p>Sophie put on a white negligee to cover up her body. She heard the sound of shoes as her husband came into the room.</p> <p>"I've come to see if it is alright." He said without looking up.</p> <p>She stood on the landing.</p> <p>"Yes, of course. You look wonderful. Now come over here and sit down. I have something for you."</p> <p>They hugged and Sophie felt the hardness of his chest pressed into her.</p> <p>"I really appreciate the way you are so kind to me. I am grateful that you and Mrs. W. let me take her shopping. I really miss all the nice things that happen to me."</p> <p>Sophie gave him a big hug but didn't feel a bra strap. She felt that her breasts would have to be a more substantial part of her chest than they already were, and they were not as large as they had been. Her husband's arms were still around her and she felt his fingers caressing her shoulders. He bent his head and gave her a long kiss on the lips. She kissed him back. Then they went and sat down to have breakfast.</p> <p>As they ate, they talked. Sophie told him about her life with her husband. This started him thinking about what she could do once he had taken over, even though he hadn't taken over since before she got pregnant but not since she had become pregnant. Sophie took no responsibility in this; it was her way of being with the other woman; she took it very well.</p> <p>Finally, they cleaned up, collected their things and left for the house. Sophie told her husband that she would be going shopping and she would bring a car for him at lunchtime. Just as she got dressed, she felt his hand on her leg as they walked up the garden path. She smiled at his hand and told him to come in his wife's car.</p> <p>In their car, they talked of everything and it was quite easy to see that they all wanted to be here and that they wanted to do everything together.</p> <p>The next morning, Sophie felt as sexy as ever.
