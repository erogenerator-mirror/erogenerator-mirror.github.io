She will be going to see a doctor tomorrow. It will be her day off. I feel it is important to see what she will think of the experience of not only my company's management team meeting at the hospital but also to have a woman present. I am sure in time I will even talk to her.</p> <p>When she arrives at work, the first thing she sees is me sitting at my desk. She asks what I am going to be doing this evening. I tell her I am going to meet with a female management specialist to sort things out in my mind. She asks what kind of things and what I am going to be looking for and what I'll be doing. I tell her I am going to have an interview and we will meet and talk for the first time.</p> <p>I ask her if she knows where her office is located. She says sure, I will be there at eight in the afternoon. I go home at the end of the night. I have a wonderful time. Just before I fall asleep I dream that I was with her at the hospital. I wake up the next morning and find myself naked before my bed. It was my first time being with a woman. She tells me that I'm ready. Of course this is not what I had in mind. I get up, strip off my clothes, and start getting into the shower. My mind is focused on the image of us in each other's arms. I get out the shower, soap myself up, and use the shower head. I get out and dry off. I get dressed quickly and head out the door.</p> <p>When I get back to my desk, I am pleasantly surprised to find the doctor waiting at the desk. The doctor opens his door looking at me. He then asks where I am off to. My stomach flutters with excitement. I tell him that I am about to be out of the hospital. I take the doctor by the hand and lead him to my office. I tell him that I want to have his opinion. It's so nice to have a doctor watch you for a change.</p> <p>After getting him into the office, I tell the doctor to keep the video camera recording. I tell him that I think he will be impressed if he gets an interview. He takes the picture. We are both sitting side by side in the doctor's office. I am looking at him now. A look of surprise on his face. He takes the camera from my hands and places it on the desk. The doctor's eyes meet mine, a smile comes to his face. I am pleased to see a man who knows that I care for him.</p> <p>The look of surprise is back on his face. He looks at me and I can see a sparkle in his eyes. I ask him to sit down. I sit in the chair across from him. He has a nervous expression on his face. I take the camera from him, put it on my desk and open it showing him both videotaping my interview with the doctor. They are both smiling as all the blood rushes to my face. I look at the doctor and the smile on his face changes to something else. I wonder if what I want to have is different or if this is my dream.</p> <p>In front of me, he turns and faces me. His expression is still that of a smile when I start talking about how the training was complete and how the company should keep its position. He's still smiling. I want him to be happy. But I guess I'm just as good a patient as him.</p> <p>"My name is Doctor Jenkins. This is Dr. Smith. Is there a problem?" I ask him to go from the record to the front door.</p> <p>"Um, no, there is no problem," he replies.</p> <p>"Good. I will put you on hold until I get back. I need to ask you a few questions about each of us."</p> <p>"OK. Here's my question. Are you ready to sign up for a new job. I have a good idea of what is coming, but do you like the job description that the company offers. Do you like the company that is being provided for you. It may take a year or up, depending on the job. Do not mention it to anybody in the company. Is that all you want?"</p> <p>He looks a little stunned.</p> <p>"I'm asking for a job," comes out of his lips.</p> <p>"Yes. I'd be happy to. You know you are welcome in any position offered as long as it is with me. Do we need to talk about your schedule?"</p> <p>"Yes. I will work as long as I can. Is there anything I should know from the information you have on me?"</p> <p>"No. We are in a professional relationship. That's all I am interested inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
