I didn't know you had a girlfriend. You look a little sad. I'll let you get some rest before you call me, please."</p> <p>I couldn't believe he had said that. He said she looked sad. He said she looked tired and puffy.</p> <p>I reached out and touched his arm. He had obviously just been waiting for me to say something. I touched his shoulder and he turned and hugged me. I leaned in and kissed his cheek.</p> <p>"I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to embarrass you. Please forgive me."</p> <p>"I'm glad it was worth it."</p> <p>They stopped at a red light. They took longer this time and came back, holding me more firmly around the waist. They both took me into the living room and went to the kitchen. I could hear the sounds of beer cans. We sat there and made out for a while before the light began to change. I knew I wanted more; but this time I needed more. I knew his tongue was still between my legs. He kissed my thigh as he pulled from me some of my juices which had been on his beard. "I don't know how to ask this," he said, "but you have to let me make love to you for you to understand. I love to make love to you."</p> <p>This time it took us to his apartment. He had a robe off the back of his bed. I could see a lot of his body.</p> <p>When we came to his couch, his back was to me.</p> <p>"How's your back? Is it sore?"</p> <p>"Yes," he said, "but not really, I have a pretty good back. You know the doctor at the hospital?"</p> <p>"Yeah,"</p> <p>"Oh, we're going to watch the fireworks tonight. We just talked about it a little today."</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>I felt like the center of the world. I had never been with a woman before. I was afraid to kiss another woman.</p> <p>"Where do we start?</p> <p>"We don't have to go far. There are a number of things that we can try. I can show you how to eat; you can get the basics."</p> <p>"What else?"</p> <p>"It's just that everything will be so new. If you're sure."</p> <p>It was the one thing I knew they could never learn.</p> <p>"Well, let's go and eat," he said and we sat down.</p> <p>"Why don't you give me your pants? I can get them off and I'll show you."</p> <p>While we were having our fun, I reached out and grabbed the belt on his robe. He reached toward me, but didn't pull it off. I got it and pulled his robe off his shoulders, exposing his tanned skin.</p> <p>"Oh my," was all I could think of.</p> <p>It was a nice body; not that he had ever looked good in the past but just that. He was muscular, like an athlete. He had some hair on his chest but it was in the places he was most sensitive. I unzipped the fly of his robe and his erection was already exposed and beginning to make a tent in his shorts. His hard dick was pointing out.</p> <p>I moved my hands and put my mouth on it. I ran my tongue all over it as he closed his eyes and groaned.</p> <p>"That feels nice."</p> <p>I pulled his boxers down and let his cock spring free. The first shot, as expected, hit my chin and went on my breasts. The second and third were as strong. All of them hit my tits but some of it hit his belly. He was close and I wanted to taste him. While I had all of his cum on my tongue, I wanted to keep it in the air.</p> <p>The smell was intoxicating, musky and sweet. I licked his dick clean with my tongue, savoring every drop of his cum that I had collected on my tongue. After he was all clean, I kissed him.</p> <p>We ended up staying up until dawn. When he walked me to the bedroom, I was not expecting anything, but he had a box in his hand with my lingerie. I had taken my panties off so I could go without a doubt. He helped me into the bed, where I fell asleep while he undressed me.</p> <p>It was dark before I had to call David. I didn't want that I would have to go outside and be able to sleep with him, but I said no. He said he had a way of letting me make up for all of my past mistakes. We did everything we could to make it up to him.</p> <p>David took me to a small coffee houseâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
