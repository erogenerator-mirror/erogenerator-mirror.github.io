I hope you know why this is so hard, to be fair," he said.</p> <p>"I dunno," she answered.</p> <p>"It's my job. You want to be with me. And you said the same thing to your parents," he said.</p> <p>"I don't know," she said.</p> <p>"I guess in a way it's hard," he said.</p> <p>"I... I don't know. You have a nice body," she said, not being able to look away from him as he took her hand and led her to the door, then out they went.</p> <p>"Well, there's nothing that I wouldn't do," he said, "and you're a nice girl. And if you want to stop by, it's okay."</p> <p>~~~~~~</p> <p>"Are you going to the game?" she said as they walked down to the bleachers at the end of the bleachers.</p> <p>"No," he nodded. "I'd like to see it with you."</p> <p>"It's really good," she said as she felt the familiar pull that she'd felt the day before in his arm.</p> <p>"Thank you," he said, "I've wanted to have seen it with you. Thank you."</p> <p>~~~~~~</p> <p>He sat with his back to the bleachers as the coach's cheerleader and her friends all came running over towards the bleachers.</p> <p>All their arms and legs were wrapped around him, they were holding him tight and just the sound of their laughter echoed through the school. He put his right hand on the small of her back and she felt as if she could hug him. The way he held her was too much. He was so handsome and strong and it was impossible to not be in that way that he seemed to be with her and not the way he was now.</p> <p>The two of them were kissing each other's cheeks and neck. She felt him go further and move his mouth down her neck, over her chin to her ear. She couldn't believe the sensation of his warm breath. He sucked on her earlobe as if his life depended on it and she loved every second of it. She knew when she'd had enough of listening to his sweet voice, letting him know that she really needed him.</p> <p>He moved on top of her and she instinctively opened her legs and he laid on top of her. He was so wonderful and she was as he said, "Wow, you are still as smooth as a peach from a day of softening."</p> <p>"Thanks," she smiled, feeling her whole body tingle at the sound.</p> <p>"We'll get to that when we get there," he smiled up at her, trying to get his feelings for her to disappear,</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>"It's going to be a long day," he nodded as they stood staring into each others eyes.</p> <p>"Okay then," she replied, "We'll get going."</p> <p>~~~~~~</p> <p>The game began but as they sat and watched the players play, neither one of them took time to realize that there was a huge difference between them, or they were as a species, and they were more like an ordinary human being, each of them wanting to be one of the best players on the team.</p> <p>It was the first game and the team really wasn't too good. Each of the guys tried, but the end result wasn't really as good as they hoped it would be, but it was still something nonetheless. As the game went on and the coaches talked quietly, so did the players.</p> <p>Their coach started the game with, "We have the day out of the gate and now we have a score to make."</p> <p>"I hope they are good," Chris said.</p> <p>"And they are," he smiled.</p> <p>"What if we score ourselves the score, then we can win?" she asked.</p> <p>"I don't see how we can have a chance," he replied. "I know I'm not the most popular player on the team, but the coach will be happy to give us an extra player in the game, because I know that is what they want."</p> <p>The game went on and the season was still going. But even once they knew each other better they still managed to lose and as they watched the team play, they found each other more and more interesting, than their opponents. When the game ended, the coach announced that he was putting in someone, he called them out and said that they'd be better off in the end.</p> <p>"I can't believe that you guys are on team duty," he called, "but it's just something that happens during an important game."</p> <p>"Coach, you need to step down if you expect us to be on the team," he pointed towards the field behind him.
