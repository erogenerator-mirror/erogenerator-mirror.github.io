With a deep breath I continued to read. I'm not what you call the best writer on the planet. Some things simply aren't the same. There's the way you would be able to find that missing piece of your own, and the pain it would cause you. Then there's the way it would look, and then there's the way it would seem, and then there's the way it would look, and then there's the way it would appear, and then there's the way the pain would appear and even though it wasn't in the first place, in the moment that's where it would appear, and I can still come into a million, if it ever comes again, and all I want is for you to go away and never see it."</p> <p>I continued to read, and even though I knew that it was impossible, I continued. For now, as I looked at the next page, it was like being in a daze. The lines on the page slowly ran out without making any progress, and at first glance I couldn't see much, but the next two or three lines left no doubt that they were missing parts of the story of how it would have happened. I tried to focus on each of the first six lines, but when I started to read one of the final lines with a new page of my mind, and it was like the whole thing was being dragged through the air by me, it wasn't funny anymore. I kept looking at the page with renewed interest and even though if I could actually get this thing off to the good parts (yes), it would be worth it to try to get it to the bad parts (hell yes) again.</p> <p>There was a second time, and I started to read a third time, but when I got back to the seventh and eighth lines, I started to get even worse. How many other lines would I have to work with to try to finish the eighth of the eight? It seemed to be an almost impossible task, but by the end of the second page, I was struggling so hard I thought I'd black out.</p> <p>My hand was still on the book, and I was struggling hard to finish the third paragraph. On the tenth page, all the while I kept trying to focus on the last line, I was having difficulty looking away from it. After that I was trying desperately to do my best to write my essay.</p> <p>Then after three hundred fifty pages of my journal entries, I started to get tired.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>"We are just at the end of our allotted time period." The announcer came through the speaker. "To go further, let us present.....................:)..."</p> <p>I smiled at the announcer, but it was dark, and so was the time. The announcer made to stand up and turn off the screen (my notebook on the floor?), but the announcer wasn't listening.</p> <p>"I am in here to be with you and thank you for your patience..." He began, "...but there will be only one word that can be used to complete the program, and with those words I wish you all the best..............."</p> <p>I looked up and saw that he was just smiling. My heart just kept beating faster.</p> <p>"I'm not sure how to start the program, I guess......" He paused. "...but if there is any other way that we could go into it, I'd love to see you."</p> <p>I looked up again.</p> <p>"But I think I'm going to need to sit here for a while, until the last word comes out, then I guess you can all sit down, but when the announcer comes back online, I will be in to give his microphone to the sponsors."</p> <p>"I hope you don't mind, but, I am going to leave you to sit here all day and have you all sit down and then..." The announcer paused again.</p> <p>"Heh yes, I think you can do it. I feel free now, that's the point. You just go ahead and sit down a little while, you should feel free to do the same thing."</p> <p>There was a pause. I stood up and began to lean back against the wall again. I could tell he was still holding the microphone in his hand.</p> <p>"But do you remember when we started this program, that was the start of a program?" he asked. "Do you remember?"</p> <p>I looked into his dark eyes once again and then I looked back into his, and we smiled. For a second I just wanted to kiss him.</p> <p>"Well......yes. I remember. My name is Sam and I will be your host this year...I hope that I can get you all back together in one night...ifâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
