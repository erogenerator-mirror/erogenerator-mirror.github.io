I can't.... I'm in you now... I gotta cum."</p> <p>And I could not last any longer. I could feel my dick throbbing, pulsing with my heartbeat, and I felt the pressure begin to build. And then, my dick released the hot cum deep inside his ass, pumping another load into us. And again, my body convulsing in shock waves.</p> <p>When I had stopped my ejaculation, he rose up, resting on his hands and knees, face contorted in contorted sexual pleasure. When I was done cumming, I withdrew my still hard dick from his ass, causing him to give a disappointed sigh.</p> <p>"Are you ready to cum now, Baby," I asked, "do it hard for my wife. Then, I'll show you what it's like to cum."</p> <p>With that, he rose up and put his dick back into his ass to feel the residual lubrication of the cum that had been oozing out of his rear hole. He began to move his hips as he slid it in and out, in and out. The friction of it was exquisite to him, and I could see beads of sweat forming on his chest and neck.</p> <p>I bent over him, pushing my mouth against his, and whispered sweet, gentle words, and his ass began to move under my oral touch. I loved to feel the texture of his skin over my lips and tongue. So silky it was erotic, and felt divine, to feel his soft muscular ass move under me as he moved up and down in my mouth.</p> <p>Soon, he was moving up and down in rhythm, the rhythm of our mutual orgasmic pleasure. As each second passed, we looked into each other's eyes, and saw in mutual pleasure that we were both in a moment of pure ecstasy.</p> <p>When our orgasms subsided a little, my dick started to soften, as we gently kissed. He said "God, that was so good...and I needed that, too." and I replied, "Yes, Baby. That was everything that just happened. And I loved it."</p> <p>I pulled the mask over my face, and said "Now, the other night, you were the center of my universe... I just wanted to show you the joy of a great orgasm."</p> <p>"Yes," he replied, "and you were beautiful and I loved it, too. I love you, too."</p> <p>When we were out of the bedroom, I stripped off the rubber, and we lay side-by-side on the bed. I felt the latex covered dick inside my ass as we kissed. He had cum in me, and I felt the sticky warm cum as it flowed in the latex back, causing his dick to twitch.</p> <p>He said softly, "Thank you, Baby. That was wonderfulâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
