What's up?"</p> <p>Lisa smiled sweetly at him and said, "I've just been feeling kind of lonely."</p> <p>"Well, we're not going to be lonely. We will be."</p> <p>He laughed at that and said, "Don't feel so alone!"</p> <p>With that, he grabbed her hand and placed it under his left trouser leg, pushing the leg of his briefs off and giving her a clear view of his penis, the tip of which was already swelling even more, and a thick drop of clear cum leaking from itself in the middle of his cock.</p> <p>As Sam turned to leave he said, "You look so beautiful." and then turned back and left the room.</p> <p>A long, sexy walk through the courtyard, hand in hand with Sam, then to the hotel, hand in hand, with Lisa, and then into their room. Sam pushed Lisa back against the bed and pulled her jeans down the her legs.</p> <p>"Oh!" Sam exclaimed, "What are you doing?"</p> <p>Lisa looked at him, confused but still excited that he had wanted her. He said, "Oh! I wanted you. You look pretty damn gorgeous. And don't you worry about losing that dress. You'll have fun showing all those guys what a horny slut you really are, and they'll keep wanting you."</p> <p>"Well, I guess I do. It seems weird talking about it."</p> <p>Sam had already opened his pants and had his swollen cock in his hand, looking at it, before taking his hard shaft out of his hand. While he watched, Lisa got out of bed and walked around the bed until she was in front of him. Her breasts were just big enough to just brush around his dick but still stick out in front of him. Her nipples seemed to press into one another and they were getting stiffer and harder as they got closer together.</p> <p>Taking his shaft in her hand she began stroking it, up and down, in and out, up and down.</p> <p>"I'm glad it's you I've been fantasizing about all week. And don't look disappointed," she said. Then she put her hands under her breasts and cupped them, lifting them in the air, pushing her nipples out toward him. "It feels really good."</p> <p>"Do it," Sam said. Sliding one of his fingers from her breast to her pussy, Lisa's pussy was already dripping wet.</p> <p>With his thumb he started rubbing his thumb up and down the length of her slit, getting her wetter than she remembered. As Sam continued to rub, Lisa put one of her hands down between her legs, getting his cock and the lubrication off as well, and slid it into her pussy, feeling that velvety head of meat as it slid into her. "Oh!" she was shocked. He wasn't big, but it felt like he was bigger than any cock she had ever felt, not to mention the feeling of his cock in her hand, and balls in her other hand.</p> <p>"You have a wonderful cock," she said, reaching for the condom on the bed and laying it back down. "So I'll just be a little late for practice," she said, "And I'll be ready for anything that'll make you happy."</p> <p>"Oh, you're so sweet," he said as he turned to go to the bathroom. "I'll be right back."</p> <p>As he walked out of the room, Lisa turned toward him and kissed him and said, "Don't worry. I'm not going to make a habit of it." She grinned at Sam and said, "Besides, you'll be in for a treat."</p> <p>He grinned back as he walked into the bedroom, pulling off his shirt and pants. He got on the bed and lay down next to Lisa. After removing all his clothes and joining her on the bed he kissed her and said, "All week dreaming about this beautiful woman. I wonder what it feels like to feel you around me." He turned toward her, pushing his cock into her so she could feel it against her.</p> <p>"I feel wonderful," she said, closing her eyes as she felt it slide between her. "The head is at the opening to my vagina, and he's in me. Are you ready for me to take charge?"</p> <p>"Not really. I'm just waiting for you to take charge."</p> <p>He reached down to the headboard of the bed and pulled the sheets from the beds head. Then sliding the rest of the bed from the mattress he put the bedding over the head of the bed and climbed onto the bed with her, getting up on one elbow and looking down into her eyes for the first time. â€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
