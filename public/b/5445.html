So I can be sure that if I get a chance, you'll have a chance as well," he smiled and added, "Or, yes, you'd end up with a great deal of money that way."</p> <p>"I was thinking a little more about it, too. Maybe if I could just, you know, do all this from a place that I could trust? Like a trust fund."</p> <p>"That sounds fun!"</p> <p>I didn't want to make any more plans that I couldn't actually make. In the end, I decided to buy a bunch of stuff I'd need. I wanted to keep my house and get a really good living, so I decided to keep going back to California.</p> <p>I rented a car, loaded my things and drove with only my books. It didn't take long to find what I was looking for: a small town house that was just down the road from where I lived. I rented a cabin in the woods, rented a car, and rented a car that I'd never tried before.</p> <p>As I drove I looked at all that I knew. I thought of all the things I'd learned. I had to try something new, I finally did. I found a cabin two miles away, but I could afford it, so I drove around the town looking in every place that I could find. After checking out a few places, I stopped and bought a couple of more books. One of the things that I really wanted to keep to myself was a journal. I read them to myself and then spent some time rereading it. Finally I decided that I had enough things to live with.</p> <p>I rented a house near where I was raised, bought a big old car, drove around a little, found a nice job; well, it was pretty good. Of course, it was only for the weekend, and I didn't need the money, but it felt nice to be spending money without worrying about anything. I still didn't know if I could afford to buy anything. I decided that I wanted to do something that could bring about the change in my life, and that would be it.</p> <p>Chapter Thirteen: Re-enactment</p> <p>I walked through the door into the main living area of my house, to the kitchen where the refrigerator was. It made me feel a little better that I was able to use the money to spend; I also felt a little better that I could really change my life. I wasn't sure what would happen, but I knew that I wanted it to happen. I had a feeling that I just might make it to the end of my rope with money. At the very least, I could get a lot of money from my book, something very useful!</p> <p>The kitchen was nice, too, but there wasn't a lot of cooking done. There was the refrigerator in one corner, and the pantry in the other. Everything looked pretty good. I could think of nothing that made me happier than cooking and getting food on a plate, or eating bread, chicken, and salad. I was just about finished with the first one when it came to the stove. I quickly set to it, and started to cook something for lunch. At the same time I was doing one of those little chores that always seemed to add up, or make someone feel better for being there.</p> <p>I kept the stove going at some point during the day, and when I did finally finish in the evening, it was time to put everything away. There were about eight or so things in the fridge that I didn't need, and most of them I could do without. I also kept the pantry to keep things out, and also kept it stocked with the basic ingredients for any kind of food I needed. I finished making most of the things, and I turned to walk upstairs into the bathroom. Of course, I was surprised when I saw a small mirror along the way of the bathroom. I picked it up, and noticed that I could see right through it. I looked at my reflection in it, and saw that I was staring at myself. I turned and looked back at the mirror. I looked down at myself, and saw that I was still staring. After a second, I looked back up at the mirror again. I looked back down.</p> <p>"Are we ready now?" I asked. I looked at myself in the mirror and saw that I still was; I looked at myself and saw what was there between my legs. It actually looked pretty nice. I looked back up at the mirror.</p> <p>At this point I didn't know how to begin anything. I had always loved shaving my legs and even used it when I had a boyfriend, but having the ability to do a little trimming after he got me to trim my pussy wasn't my whole reason for doing it anyway. The reason that I now wanted to shaveâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
