She had to have them, at least the panties. She had to see how well her mother would react and how much control she had on her daughter. “I need to pee really badly.” She dropped to the ground and put her panties on the ground. “Oh mom, I am so sorry.” She didn’t have to move. Her hands were trembling. It wouldn’t have any problem she imagined seeing her mother’s hand in her panties. She would only make sense if she stood there holding her panties to her nose, and she didn’t have to look up. Her mouth was dry and her heart was beating in her chest. “I am going to go,” she thought. Her mind raced, and in her mind, thinking about her daughter naked. Would she be able to control it? Would dad find out? She knew that if he found out, she would be his to do with as he pleased. If she did that, there would be consequences. She turned and went into the house. She could hear Dad talking. She didn’t hear the door shut. What the hell was dad up to? This wasn’t normal. What in hell was taking place here? What was this whole thing about her panties in her pocket? It had to have been a prank.</p> <p>Jane’s stomach knotted as she entered the bathroom. She thought she would die. She ran a hand over her body, trying to will the nausea to subside. She could feel the juices dripping down her thighs. Her head was shaking now and if it was any indication of what it was doing, her legs felt weak. It took her a moment to get the breath back to her stomach. What had just happened? Why hadn’t she let on to her daughter that she was a freak? Oh, how could mom expect her to get a good handle on the situation? And now… . .she was standing naked, with her panties in her hand. She tried to step out of the bathroom and into her bedroom without looking up at the bed. No. She couldn’t do it. She couldn’t do it, either. She was going to go and get herself into some weird hole in the bed with her daughter. And if she didn’t go… . .the first thing in her life, she knew she would never be able to walk out of here, without saying a word to her daughter. There was no way she would do that. She walked briskly down the hall to the door at the end of the hall. She could hear her daughter starting to cry. She almost didn’t move. She wanted to go, but the next thing she know, her daughter was in the bathroom. She could hear their voices calling each other, begging desperately for help.</p> <p>“Help! Help!” I can’t help it. I can’t.” “Mom! Help! Mom!"</p> <p>She heard her daughter’s voice screaming. She could hear their bodies slapping together. They were having sex. Their cries sounded more like orgasms, but they were having unprotected sex. What was she thinking? She’s supposed to go and get her daughter. She had to go and tell her.</p> <p>When her daughter finally opened the bathroom door, all Jane heard was the sounds of a wet slapping. The bathroom door closed softly, but it opened as her daughter came out of the doorway. She walked over to her daughter, stood for a moment. “Are you okay?”. Jane nodded as she took the panties from her daughter, put them to her nose, and went for the bathroom. When she opened the door, she could see that her daughter was holding her panties. She could tell that her face was red and she tried to lift her face to look. At least she could lift her face and her chin. She was afraid of what she would do. She could see the fear on her daughter’s face mirrored in hers. She closed the door and looked at her daughter.</p> <p>Jane turned and looked at her mother. She could see the anger on her face. She saw guilt. She could see that there was anger in her face. It wasn’t anger but kind of disappointment? She thought about how she had felt, when they had first met earlier in the day. This was very different than her mother’s. She wasn’t angry at her mother or at Steve. In fact, it was sort of like a relief. She couldn’t do this. It wasn’t something—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
