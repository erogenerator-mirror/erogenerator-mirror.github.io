Your eyes bright with fire, the way your mouth glides, I see a pained expression of desire in those blue eyes, your body moving against mine, your nipples pressing up against my chest as you reach to grab my hair, pulling, pulling your breast closer to that warm, tight mound, my hands move to cradle your hips as you lift yourself, arching a little higher, moaning as I kiss you.</p> <p>I kiss my way down your tummy while still massaging that small mound with my free hand. My tongue gently probing the tip of your nipple, I can taste the sweet, slippery texture of you as it slips slowly into my mouth. I hear you moan, pressing harder into my mouth, enjoying my lips and tongue on your breasts. Your legs parted as I move down your front, kissing the small strip over your belly button as I reach the base of your body. I smile as you reach down to spread your legs, inviting me to take what I wanted to and taste it.</p> <p>I lift my head, my fingertips tracing the lines of your belly button, slowly lower. My warm mouth presses on your belly button as my tongue moves over you, my teeth sinking lightly into the soft skin of it. Slowly moving forward, my tongue touches your clit, and then my mouth closes round you and begins to suck. I feel your fingers tighten in my hair, pushing up into my face, the sensation of my mouth against your sex is too much as I feel your hips lift involuntarily up from the mattress. I feel your knees tighten and then relax as I continue, my tongue moving over your skin, swirling, drawing and then swirling again.</p> <p>My teeth lightly graze your skin, your breathing becoming more labored as my tongue continues to play with your clit, my hands moving to feel your thighs. Slowly, my hands move up to hold each arm tightly, knowing you are not used to having this touch. Your hands slide up and grip my shoulders, my hands slipping beneath you as I kiss you deeply on the lips, tasting you, moving my hands to slowly part your lips with my fingers so that I can taste you, my tongue pushing against your clit as I slide one finger into your, slowly drawing it back out and then sinking it deep inside your warmth.</p> <p>My hands move to your breasts, my fingers rolling the nipples, then I move from your breast down to your hips, my tongue moving against your skin as I work, slowly moving from your hips to your clit, my finger probing, spreading your juices over your lips. I feel your body lift higher, sliding against my fingers that move deeper, pushing against you. You arch onto me, pressing your thighs against my chest, feeling my skin against yours over and over.</p> <p>You reach one arm around me, pulling my face against the side of your neck and you whisper, "I can't last long, Baby".</p> <p>This is it, you want it don't you? You say it so softly to wake me from my slumber, that is my only response.</p> <p>As you feel the release in your body, you know I am ready. You tell me to lie on my back, laying back against the pillow, knowing your body will be waiting for it. As I lay with my head thrown back, I can feel a little of your juices as I stroke your body, your back, the gentle curve of your breasts. Your nipples are hard beneath my fingertips as I slide a finger from your lips to the swollen bud of your clit. My hands slide over your stomach as I feel you, my hands sliding up and around to grab your hair, pushing your body against me, my mouth moving to suck your breast while I slide my finger in.</p> <p>My fingers begin to slowly work your body as my mouth plays with your nipple, my finger sliding inside your warmth. I kiss you, our lips pressing together between kisses, a moan escapes my lips as your body moves against mine. Your hands move to my head, pulling me closer to your chest, feeling the softness of my hair beneath your fingers. I feel your body move to press harder against your finger as I press my mouth against your skin, my tongue working to capture the slick liquid coating my fingertip, my lips moving slowly on your nipple. You begin to buck against my hand, your hands coming to rest on my head, your nipples hard against my back, pushing up toward me in my mouth.</p> <p>You can feel me, your body now on your own, my body is mine and mine alone. Your breast rises, sliding against my body as I move against your body, feeling my hand sliding across your hip, your thigh, as your hips slide to meet my hand. You find yourself wanting me; wanting to feel my hands on your body instead of me.</p> <p>"God you are hot", you whisper against my earâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
