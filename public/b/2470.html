"I'll catch up in fifteen minutes. What's on your mind?"</p> <p>"I just want to stop by the local adult book store and see what I can find."</p> <p>He smiled when I said it. I could see the wheels turning in his mind.</p> <p>"I guess you're hungry, then. We can go and get some breakfast in the hotel, maybe take a look around before going on our walk. It's in the hotel lobby to the left. I'll pick you up at seven o'clock, no later. It looks like an upscale area, but I'll know the place at lunch."</p> <p>I smiled at him and said, "OK." I turned and started walking. When we got to the hotel, I went inside. The desk clerk smiled at me. I had one of those smiles you get when people like you like them. I walked into the room and I was immediately struck by the amount of clothes and lingerie I had on. One of those suits was in the closet. I thought about going for the suit and leaving it in there, but I didn't want to scare anyone away. I turned back and headed for the bed which was on the other side of the room. It sat on the bed a perfect setting, so it would look good on me also. I found the suit and went to see what it was.</p> <p>It was a black suit, but it had an obvious name on it. The front was a very sheer fabric. I could see the material of it clinging to my body. The front had some material that would just blend into me when I got on the bed. The suit was really pretty. I was wearing a sheer white robe on top. It had a slit up one side, and I knew I would have a really nice pair of lingerie if I wore the robe. I walked out the door and into the hotel lobby.</p> <p>As I turned back towards the parking lot, I had a smile on my face. There was almost always a parking lot full of people. I felt the familiar feeling that I had always felt when I was having lunch with a friend or colleague at a work place. This time, I decided that I liked the suit, so I went for the suit.</p> <p>The clerk greeted me at the lobby entrance and told me that I should park there. I could hear music coming from the room as he walked out into the parking lot. When I climbed out, we both smiled and he got out again. Before he could get out, I was already pulling off the robe I had on and off. I had some of that same suit on under it. I was holding it out to him.</p> <p>"Do you like it?" I asked. "Would you like to stay in it?"</p> <p>"It's very nice, honey," he answered. "You look very sexy, and I'll stay in it."</p> <p>I smiled at him, then I opened the door for him.</p> <p>"Are you dressed, too?" I asked.</p> <p>He looked at me, and I smiled again. I took him to the front desk and asked if he could be checked out. He smiled again and nodded. I was still holding his hand when I got up, walked him to the front desk and said, "The room number is 756, right there if he wants to get checked in."</p> <p>When he reached up, he put his hand around my waist and squeezed my ass as I leaned against him. He squeezed it and his other hand was on my thigh. I started to get a bit impatient.</p> <p>When he pulled away, I was ready to get serious. He said, "Would you like to stay?"</p> <p>"Really?" It sounded so good. I just couldn't seem to get him out of my mind. "Sure thing. You can call me any time."</p> <p>He smiled then and gave me a kiss for doing so. I walked him to the elevator, then I pulled him in for a long passionate make out session with him. When I took his hand in mine, he was smiling as we walked away from the elevator.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Chapter Five: I hope</p> <p>We didn't get back to the room until almost ten o'clock Friday. It wasn't until that time that I even considered going with him to the restaurant for lunch. I didn't really know exactly what I wanted to do as I really didn't have much experience. I decided not to go. I figured lunch with a coworker was a good start, and it would do me some good for my ass that I could get a job soon enough.</p> <p>That Friday, I got off work at seven when I saw the name of one of the restaurant on my caller ID. I couldn't tell what the restaurant was but they told me it was called the Pâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
