He said as he stood there staring at her with those big grey eyes.</p> <p>"What's your name?"</p> <p>"Tom. But you already know my daddy," he said while smiling brightly.</p> <p>He was about fifty, a big guy at around six feet tall. Not one of those Hollywood type guys; his build was around average, but he carried himself well. His eyes were a nice shade of blue, always taking in the beauty of the night, and his hair was always short. His eyes were a deep black that glowed with a light sheen of sweat that could melt the cold. When he smiled, and when he saw her, every time they met, the sight made him feel like he was melting every part of his body. He was almost too handsome, with long, blonde hair that framed his sweet face. He always dressed nice and it gave him the appearance of an angel on his sweetest angel as a lover.</p> <p>"It's nice to finally meet you."</p> <p>"It's nice to finally meet you." He said then gave a little shiver as he heard the word. He felt an overwhelming urge to hug her. He was never able to get a hug like that from a woman. Especially one who was so beautiful that a woman wouldn't take no for an answer. He was always trying to find her weakness. He felt compelled to be as gentle as he could and to make her feel as good as he could. His whole body just seemed to be on edge, his heart beat fast. He could feel a knot of nervousness start to form in his groin.</p> <p>"You look beautiful tonight." His voice sounded like it came from a distance that was in every direction.</p> <p>"Thank you. You're so beautiful to hear." She blushed but didn't say any more.</p> <p>"Let's go see where the party is. I'm sure you'll want to get out of these clothes and have some fun" He said as he took her by the hand and pulled her through the kitchen. They stood there for a moment before he looked her up and down again, taking in the vision of her. Even though he had come down here to be alone with her, he just couldn't help himself. He had already given that little girl of hers a piece of candy and now he was going to go and have the two of them make love to each other. He wanted to make love like in a romantic romantic movie. He wanted to lick her from her beautiful face to her sweet little toes so long as they could all be kissed.</p> <p>Her lips are so soft and moist. They weren't the type to be kissed in that way. Her lips glistened with an intoxicating scent that only a woman would want to inhale. He could see her looking at him intently with a look as if he were a hungry man just about to devour his prize. He wanted to hold her and take her into his arms all night long. He wanted to kiss her so hard and long she could hardly breathe. She looked up at him as if he were a goddess. He couldn't stop smiling because even though he didn't know her name, he saw someone that looked as if he could make her scream. It was the girl, she looked at him with her most beautiful, sexy smile that somehow had him in a stupor.</p> <p>"I'll take you home." He said.</p> <p>"I don't see where this is getting anywhere." She replied.</p> <p>"Well, I'll see what the people are into then and see what kind of friends they are." He replied. He felt a little excited but he wasn't thinking clearly. It was all too real.</p> <p>It was now ten to nine. He sat back in the sofa as he watched her walk away from him in the dim glow of the light that was on in the kitchen. She looked a bit different from the last time he saw her. She was taller and dressed in a silky dress with a scoop neck line. She was wearing a pair of high heeled slippers on her pretty feet while she swayed from side to side in her stilettos. Her makeup was subtle but it had a mesmerizing effect on him. She had a thin and light blue veil draped over her eyes. He thought this would be very comfortable to walk this time, after all he had spent the last few nights talking to her. A part of him wanted to sit and watch her all day just like last night. But what part of him couldn't control himself anymore.</p> <p>"So I was just wondering if it was possible to spend time with a beautiful stranger today if it's not too busy?"</p> <p>"Sure. But I don't know how you would figure out that there's no one else in the room."</p> <p>"Itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
