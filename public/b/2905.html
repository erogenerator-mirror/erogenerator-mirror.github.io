It was so very nice and very relaxing. No one else had ever taken his hand there. He felt a shiver go up his spine.</p> <p>"You don't have to do that."</p> <p>"Not unless you want to," he said.</p> <p>"Of course I do," she said.</p> <p>His head fell back, his mouth a little open.</p> <p>"You're going to make me so uncomfortable," he whispered.</p> <p>She nodded her head. Her eyes were closed, her lips pressed together. It was almost a relief to touch her. Her hand slid up to his cheek. She gave him a small squeeze. He shivered at the small touch, but she just held him and stroked his hair.</p> <p>"I will be so glad when it's over. I want to make you feel as wonderful as I did before the kiss ended."</p> <p>She kissed him again. Her body pressed against his own, like a pair of hungry cats kissing each other for the first time. Her legs wrapped around him, her hips pressing down against his pubis. He shifted around to take her in, but his lips sought hers again, and he kissed her as strongly as he had kissed her. She let out a low moan. He pressed deeper. The kiss was long and deep, lingering, exploring.</p> <p>"You're so sweet," he said.</p> <p>"Why do you say so?"</p> <p>"Because you're so sweet," he said. "I think I have a confession to make."</p> <p>It was a moment or two later, when their mouths parted and their tongues sought each other out. He felt her warm body against him, as though they were making love right in that moment. They kissed long and hard again. She had become so aroused and so willing. She kissed him back with more passion than any kiss he had ever shared with anyone. When they broke apart, she was biting and licking at his cheeks and chin. He knew she had just wanted him to kiss her. Something to hold over his head for the afternoon.</p> <p>"Are we going to stop?" he asked as he pulled her up onto his lap.</p> <p>"No," she whispered as her arms were around his neck.</p> <p>He didn't respond. He moved his hands to her back, cupping her. She moaned as he did so, arching her back. "So warm," he murmured as his lips descended on her neck, nipping with his teeth at the sensitive skin. She moaned again and rubbed her body into his. As she neared her peak, her hand dropped to his pants. He felt her fingers wrap his own, gently massaging him and his own hardness as she continued to kiss him, rubbing herself against his leg.</p> <p>He broke their kiss and moved down her neck as his hands took hers. She wrapped her arms around him. One hand took hold of his manhood, stroking the full length of his shaft. He moaned at the touch. Her lips moved in a path down his chest. The kiss led slowly back to his mouth. She let out a sigh of pleasure before their lips once again sealed. She kissed him until he opened his mouth more fully and their lips and tongues intertwined with a passion that could only be expressed by the feel of his member in her hand. She wrapped her arms around the waistband of his pants and unclasped them as they broke their embrace. As she slowly pushed him back to sit on the couch, she stood up and pulled her clothes back on. He watched her, speechless.</p> <p>"You know," she said a second-to-minute later, "I guess I shouldn't be saying this, but I just can't help myself from trying."</p> <p>"Is that a bad thing?"</p> <p>She looked very hesitant for a moment, but nodded her head.</p> <p>"It's alright; we'll be able to figure it out, just don't get me in trouble or anything."</p> <p>"Just don't do anything."</p> <p>"Just please, don't go crazy and just hold me or anything."</p> <p>He smiled. "Of course I will."</p> <p>They sat there for a little while longer, sipping wine and enjoying the afterglow of their first kiss together. When they finally separated, the smile on her face was one of wonder. He saw her eyes widen as she remembered his kiss. His eyes closed as he drifted into bliss.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>When he awoke, he was alone. He sat up and looked at himself in the reflection on the mirror. He wasn't feeling the least bit bad, he was just worried about this morning. He felt like he had just been onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
