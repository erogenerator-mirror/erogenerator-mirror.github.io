We were sharing drinks and dancing at a secluded little table in the corner of the large room.</p> <p>-</p> <p>We talked almost every night as she worked on me with two fingers and sucked and nibbled on my nipples until my body began to tighten. The wine and the wine were making a difference already. Soon, I could feel the warmth building in me again.</p> <p>-</p> <p>Soon, she was sucking on my tits and fingering my pussy. She had me out of my clothes, then she kissed and sucked on my thighs.</p> <p>-</p> <p>Soon, the kissing became more forceful... I opened my legs up to each of her fingers, giving her free reign.</p> <p>-</p> <p>Soon I couldn't take any more. I was on the edge and I lifted my dress and began playing with my clit.</p> <p>-</p> <p>Soon, I began to moan louder and louder until I screamed it out... she licked my pussy faster and sucked on my clit. Soon, I was coming... with her still on my pussy, kissing my pussy and tasting my cum....</p> <p>-</p> <p>After a few more hours of fun together, the last of the guests had left, we danced to a slow tune and then another slow one.</p> <p>-</p> <p>She looked beautiful sitting there at the table. I told her how stunning she looked and told her where I was. She smiled and told me that she was very happy that she would join me in this nightâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
