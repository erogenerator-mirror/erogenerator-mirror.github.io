She swallowed the last of it, and licked her lips clean. The next day, she was called to her Master's office and his office was quite open. His secretary was looking as though she had given more than an initial examination. John had no idea that she had been a 'good girl', as he had just learned.</p> <p>He was about to introduce a new employee to his office, but the door opened and the secretary came running in. She was in her late late 20s, and quite stunning. As was the secretary, she made her way up to the desk to get her attention. She gave John an appraising expression.</p> <p>"I haven't seen you for days, sir." She said, almost in a whisper. John was struck again. She was gorgeous, he thought. Her long, blonde hair was held in place to frame her face, and she sported a face that was perfectly framed by two high-pitched breasts that were just barely big enough to be beautiful. She was certainly looking like a woman twenty years younger than she actually was. Her long legs, clad in stockings, were just as shapely and shapely, and her high heels brought out her body nicely.</p> <p>"May I sit down Miss?" John asked. The secretary did seem interested in him, though, judging from her appearance. Still, John didn't know her well...</p> <p>"Certainly, sir. Come sit down, miss." He said, gesturing for her to sit down. He sat down on the same side of her chair, which was close enough for him to feel her warmth. "Please have a seat." He told the secretary, and left the room.</p> <p>"Thank you very much, sir," She said, returning to his side as he sat back against the opposite wall. "I don't have a Master's card."</p> <p>"That is not a problem. Would you like a reminder of your position within my company?" He asked, putting her through her paces... she didn't have a title, that was for sure. Her last name was the same as the one Master's had given her earlier. It made her feel very much subordinate to him, though still kind of demeaning.</p> <p>"Yes, sir." She said, nodding her head as best she could, and then, to John's surprise, she reached out and took his hand in hers. "I have a Master's card," she said, and proceeded to read.</p> <p>John was a rather tall man. He had a fair sized beard, and his eyes twinkled as he peered down at his hand-to-a-ma'am with pride. "Would Master please take that down, so I can see what Sir wants from me?" He asked her.</p> <p>"Your pleasure is my pleasure, Sir." She replied.</p> <p>"Then perhaps you would feel more comfortable in my chair here, Miss." John looked around the office, and could see that he had some rather interesting things waiting. He picked up a folder and began to unfold it. "Take your skirt off, and we'll get to some really explicit, if I may add, examples of what Sir expects you to do to please me. It doesn't really seem fair to tell you in a way that Sir expects to see everything, Sir, in a single word. I believe that Master would prefer to go first, and, as such, I'll take the lead."</p> <p>"As you command, Sir." She replied.</p> <p>John smiled and began to unfold the folder. He sat down in the chair, and then began to work. As he did, he could feel the chair's arms relax and drop to the floor behind him. As he worked, he glanced back down her body several times, watching her ass as it lifted to meet his gaze.</p> <p>"I see that Sir has made his mark in your eyes, Miss?" He asked, as he pulled out the paper work of a document in front of him.</p> <p>"Very much so, Sir." She answered him, smiling as she did. She was glad to feel that he was appreciating her company, and for it to continue.</p> <p>"It's been very productive, Miss..." She tried to think of a suitable phrase as her mind flashed back to him and the feel of his body on top of hers. "I see that you seem to have acquired some... personal habits of your own, Sir. Perhaps we would agree?" He asked her.</p> <p>"Well, Sir, what is Sir, anyway?" She asked him again. "What... things... is Sir?" she asked. She had never heard a man say Sir to herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
