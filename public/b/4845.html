I’ll take your advice – for a start anyway.”</p> <p>“Sure.” I nodded. Just a drink or two might be nice.</p> <p>“That sounds a lot fun.”</p> <p>“I guess.”</p> <p>He took in my body. He took note of it all. Long dark hair almost covering my face. A nice tight body and good looking face.</p> <p>“What do you think?” He asked.</p> <p>The wine was loosening my throat. I looked to the side to see if I was right or wrong. He had a nice strong sense of humour. A feeling I hadn’t had in years.</p> <p>“Are you sure you don’t want me to undress?” No, I was definitely not that way. It seemed too natural. “No.”</p> <p>I just stood there, looking at him, my head lowered to the floor.</p> <p>“What do you think of me?”</p> <p>I was trembling. My knees were weak. My whole body was taut.</p> <p>“You’ve got a great body.” I looked up at him, his eyes were looking at me.</p> <p>As soon as he said it, I knew it. I smiled nervously. After all, we just met. I looked at him again, his eyes looked at me, almost as if I was someone else. I slowly looked back at the floor. If I did this, I was sure I would have my skirt lifted.</p> <p>“I just love looking at you. Are you sure you don’t mind?” He said.</p> <p>God. I blushed. Did I speak out of turn? I just stood there looking at him. He was looking at me with a very good-looking smile.</p> <p>I stood very straight. I didn’t take my eyes off his face and he just smiled. It seemed so natural I thought.</p> <p>He sat down next to me. We both sat there looking at nothing. I was feeling a weight in my stomach.</p> <p>“You’re pretty…” He began to say and I interrupted him.</p> <p>“What do you think?” I asked again.</p> <p>“I love you.” My heart was in my chest. I was feeling so close to him.</p> <p>“And I want to be closer to you.” I said nervously.</p> <p>“I’m sure.”</p> <p>“Good.” I replied trying to compose myself.</p> <p>I could see he had a strange smile on his face.</p> <p>“Is… is everything alright?”</p> <p>“Umm, yes.” I said nervously.</p> <p>“You have a beautiful body.”</p> <p>I did look at him a little bit. He was kind of handsome, but I didn’t think it seemed quite right. His eyes were so soft. He was looking at me while he spoke. His eyes were full of a different kind of passion. It was as if he was looking into the soul of me. I suddenly felt so safe with him.</p> <p>Before he left his seat I gave him one too. After the usual exchange of looks, he leaned back and I went back in.</p> <p>The two of us were quiet. Even after my last boyfriend said he loved me, I was not so sure this was my boyfriend. He was so very confident and gentle. He touched my neck gently or kissed my lips in that soft way, like he was looking at me for guidance. I felt so sexy. He kissed me again and softly pushed his lips into me, like the first time – with such feeling I just felt like melting into him.</p> <p>I started to kiss him some more. I thought of him and felt the guilt again. The guilt was gone. He kissed me with so much passion. I began to make out with him again, his lips were now on my neck, my shoulder, my shoulder. It was so sensual and exciting.</p> <p>We spent a lot of time in front of each other, just holding each other. It was nice.</p> <p>We just hugged and kissed and touched as we just walked.
