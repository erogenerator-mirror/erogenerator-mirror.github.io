I was lying in a bed with only a sheet covering my naked body. I turned over on my side to face her and she looked at me, and I said softly, "I'm sorry, I'm in the house and not in the bedroom."</p> <p>She gently stroked my hair and said, "I wouldn't do it if I didn't want to, I just wanted you. You're my friend, we were friends before. I think, now, that I loved you."</p> <p>I hugged her and said, "We were friends again when we were young, I had a good relationship with you, I guess we always got along. I know we were different, but it's been years since we have been together." I got up and walked over to her and she held my face in her hands and kissed me, softly at first, then with a passion that surprised me and made me tingle.</p> <p>"Lana, we should not be getting so carried away. Not after what we just did."</p> <p>She pulled me down on the bed with her and we kissed, slowly at first then we got more aggressive and began to move against each other in earnest. We got to our feet and embraced at the foot of the bed as far as we could go and I rubbed my leg against her and found her pussy with the outline of it. She responded immediately and reached down to me and with fingers in my hair and I rubbed my cheek against hers and kissed her back, moving on top of her. I felt her hand on my dick and she moved it away and I groaned softly. She smiled and I smiled back at her as I leaned up against her and kissed her softly.</p> <p>We lay in bed kissing for a while enjoying the feel of our bodies as they intertwined with each other, but not for too long. I was so wet that I had to put an extra pair of panties on and she had to put one on and come back to me when she felt my body pressing into hers. Laying back up, she told me, "This is not a bad idea. But you've been thinking of my pussy and how you love doing it. It will get you good at it and you will be an attentive lover. I am here and it's going to get better. Are you sure?"</p> <p>I looked down at her and asked, "What about the rest of my body?</p> <p>She lay back and smiled at me and said, "Well, I think you need protection as well." She reached out and started to stroke my dick and as she did so, she reached behind her and with a gentle hand, she guided me into her warm and wet depths and slowly started to move me in and out, kissing me as we kissed and caressed each other.</p> <p>It was almost a second later that she stopped and said, "Lie with me and kiss me. We've got a lot of making up to do. Maybe some time next week?"</p> <p>I pulled her to me and felt my dick sliding deep into her, feeling her warmth, feeling our mingled juices mixing, feeling her breasts flatten against my chest, feeling her softness and pressing my dick against an area that was not there for most of women who liked to ride it with a bit of enthusiasm. The sensation was overwhelming and it took me a minute or so to come and again she reached down to me and stroked me as I was going in and out of her. It was more than I had been able to take and I came within seconds and she kept milking my cock and it softened.</p> <p>She moved down as I rolled to the side to have some space and I kissed her, tasting her tongue. She kissed me and said softly, "I love you, baby. I have always loved you. I think we should never do this again."</p> <p>I kissed her again, holding her close and said, "I love you too and if we do, never again."</p> <p>Lana was looking at me lovingly and said, "No baby, we may never do this again. We always wanted to, but we couldn't."</p> <p>"I know and I'll find people who do it to me and give me my freedom." I said firmly, as I smiled at her and gently pushed her back so we were laying back on the pillows. I kissed her gently, then lay down between her and ran my thumb lightly up one of her nipples which was erect. I watched the light show for a while, then started lightly sucking it before moving back down, my tongue tracing the outline of her nipples, while my lips felt the texture of her skin. This time, a light touch that made her shudder, then I started on lower.
