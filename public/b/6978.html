I asked as I turned off the hot shower. I looked at the towel and saw I had wet my hair but as you said, I wanted to see how much hair it would have on my body tomorrow. As my mind started to wander, my stomach dropped to the ground. God he had made me so damned wet. I had so many secrets, I just thought that the only way to go would be to use the bathroom. I walked through the apartment door and I knew the moment you opened that door you would know exactly what was coming and what I was in the middle of doing. I walked to the master bedroom and began to make myself a coffee as I stood in front of the mirror in my robe just thinking about what had been happening. I had thought about calling for you to come into the bedroom, but I had never gone that far so I just went to take a shower and do my morning business and to think about how I was going to feel later that evening.</p> <p>After washing my hair, I was about to turn back into the room when I heard them come in. In a rush I turned on the light but I could still hear them coming toward me. I saw what I thought was them both naked as they quickly grabbed me in a hard kiss on the lips with passion and desire. There were no words to be spoken on either of their lips but they just moved their hands all over my body. After having some coffee they were both busy pulling down the zipper on my robe. Then I had no idea that I was watching them as they undressed each other. My first vision was of myself in lingerie that was just lying on the bed with them going down each others clothes. My mind had switched from thinking about what they looked like to a thought of what it looked like. My mind was racing as I watched them undo each others belts and pull down the front of their pants. Both of them moved to get on their knees, I could not but I still could hear them taking turns sucking on each others breasts. In a wild frenzy, their hands were all over each others bodies, each one was driving them to the edge of orgasm. The other person was kissing the left side of each other and the other hand was squeezing and rubbing their breasts. I was thinking that it was time to go to breakfast as I walked with the towel that they had just pulled up covering my body.</p> <p>They had me lay on my back as they were working themselves toward an orgasm. I felt the lips on my ear and then the lips and face of my husband moving over me. As his tongue entered my ear his fingers started to massage my mound as his mouth slid over mine. He was still on his knees as my knees opened with his head under my robe. His fingers were sliding over my clit as his tongue worked its way into my mouth and was dancing with my tongue as he began to massage his lips on mine. I knew I was in complete ecstasy.</p> <p>He had stopped what he was doing for a moment and lifted my legs to rest against his chest as he began moving toward my thighs. He told me to close my eyes as he kissed his way down. When he was at my feet he had taken the hose out of my robe and slid it up to my hips as he kissed my ankle. By this time my feet were still in his hands, I reached out to help him. We kissed each others tongues as his hands slid up the outside of my legs. My hands moved up to his head; my legs parted as his fingers slid around the front of the elastic band of my panties. He began to pull the material down as he broke the kiss and looked directly into my eyes as he hooked his finger in the belt around the leg of my underwear and pulled it off. As the panties dropped to the floor his mouth moved from my chest toward mine as he pushed my body back against his cock and slid his hand from my body to my breast. I had my eyes closed as he started to kiss his way down my stomach, my leg sliding between his legs as he opened the lips of my pussy with his finger and entered me. I had to tell him to stop as my thighs squeezed together as he started to go at it. It felt incredible as his finger went in and out, moving slowly in and out, but I knew after he made me cum that he was going to make me cum. He was fucking me with his finger while his mouth would suck on my lips. He was working me up to another orgasm but he wanted to hear me cum and wanted to cum in my mouth. I had to have him now. As he began to suck really hard on my clit with his finger he slid his finger out to move it slowly to my lips where he had already been kissing my breasts and sucked on them. I began to move my hips in rhythm to his hand as he moved the finger from my mouth to my clit.
