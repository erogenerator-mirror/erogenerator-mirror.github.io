His skin darkened like sunburn and his eyes were almost black. I felt like a shadow. We stepped towards each other and he leaned his head back while he stared through his long lashes.</p> <p>"This is my friend, Jack," he said by reaching out to shake his hand. I wasn't going to argue.</p> <p>"No, I don't think so," I said. I wasn't sure what to do or say. Jack's blue eyes seemed to bore into me and his mouth and lips were soft. I was glad for all those years he had been with me after all these years. What would they say? Jack would probably kill me, right now.</p> <p>What the fuck is going on?</p> <p>I looked at both of them. It was obvious why I didn't want to make an entrance. The bar was crowded. Someone had to be out there and I was sure it was Jack. I couldn't look them in the face and I couldn't pretend I didn't see a lot of what they did to each other. I felt trapped. I didn't know how to get the Hell out of here. I still needed the money.</p> <p>"Hey," I said, trying to smile. This was going to be easy. "Can we get some refreshment before we order our drinks?" I offered.</p> <p>Jack looked at me. He shook hands with the man behind the bar. The bartender raised his glass and poured me a glass. It was cold so I took a big swallow of water and let it burn in my throat. He put his glass down and moved aside. He leaned over and put his arm around my shoulder and pulled me closer. I turned and rested my head on his chest. He squeezed my shoulder and whispered in my ear.</p> <p>"Maybe I'm not the best guy to have you, but I'm not exactly a snobby man." With that he turned my head and kissed me and I let the kiss happen. When it ended and he pulled back my eyes fell on his lips. He ran his tongue along my lips and I could taste my lipstick on his mouth.</p> <p>He smiled and reached over towards my leg to pick up the glasses. His hand slid down my bare thigh under the table. When he reached my cock it was hard. I knew it was time to play and when he did I would take him home. I wanted him in the worst way. I pushed my chair back and stood up as he reached for the glasses. We broke the kiss. I got a better look at the man at the bar as a second man, in his late fifties and a little older than I was and his wife had to be there. He was about the same height as Jack and looked like a teenager. I felt a little uneasy but his eyes kept returning to me. He didn't try to see more and I felt ashamed.</p> <p>We drank our fill quickly and left the bar together. We walked back to his car in silence. His hand rested on the small of my back. As he drove I couldn't help but feel a little guilty for feeling this way. I never could get past how much I felt for this man. He had turned down a guy so much I wasn't sure if he even wanted sex or not. It was just sex or sex with an old guy who never really got over me. He had already made the mistake of asking me out on a date and I wasn't going to give up on the guy either.</p> <p>Chapter Four: The Kiss</p> <p>He didn't try to drive home because we had a lot of time to kill and he was only staying an extra day because of our shopping trip. It made up for his cheating when we got home. He never tried to stop kissing me even when we got to his house. Sometimes he just couldn't get the kiss out of his mind. We kissed and talked and just hung out. He would tell me all the time that he needed the money and he needed a little more than me.</p> <p>Sometimes, there would be times that he'd stop kissing and make some excuse and we would get into the back seat. That was our best chance to show him how to get it back. Jack pulled off to the side of the street. He had changed into a pair of shorts and a t-shirt as I drove. When I drove up his driveway I noticed a car sitting in the driveway. As I pulled up behind it she looked over at us and smiled when I got out of the car and stopped. She must have watched us for awhile.</p> <p>"Come on, you're late," she said with a grin. We got out of the car and locked it and walked over to the front door. I was just in time for her to open it and look out when a huge man entered the home.</p> <p>"Jack, this isâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
