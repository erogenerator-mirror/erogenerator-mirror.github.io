His mouth sucked at them, and they slipped over his teeth and along his tongue as he held them. He let them slip, and then began to massage her. She moaned softly again, and she was becoming so turned on by everything that went on in this small room, that she almost wanted him to take her, to fuck her, to have her. She felt it in his hands, his lips, his breath on her neck, his hands on her ass. She realized what he wanted her to do again. She arched her back and brought her legs up. He slid two fingers in between her legs, up and down, then back up toward her clit. He rubbed her at the top of her wet, swollen pussy lips, and slid his fingers over the hood. He pushed her ass back toward him—not out of the shower, but up toward him. She groaned again, and he slid both fingers in her. "Oh yes!" he called out. He was teasing her.</p> <p>"Oh God!" was his quiet reply.</p> <p>"That's it! Now move your wet fingers in and out so it makes them wet—yes! God, yes! Keep doing that! Oh my God! Oh, God!"</p> <p>He had her right where he wanted her. Her ass cheeks were pushing out toward him, her legs had kicked around between his spread legs, leaving her pussy lips open. He slid one hand up over her ass, pressing down against a spot deep in her that made her feel like that.</p> <p>"Yes!" she cried out again. "Oh my God! Do me now! Do me! Oh—Oh that's so nice. Please..." But he was going to put his cock right in her! Oh, God! She had never been touched there in such a way before—but that thought was too far—but not for long. She felt that she was going to come. That she would—or would—that she knew she would! But he did not pull back the way she was coming on his fingers. He was using his hand firmly on her clit as he pushed into her. Oh yes, there was that now! Yes!!! Oh, yes!!!" Her whole body went rigid. She arched her back, pushing her tits out more and farther. He pushed hard into her, and held himself in her. She was coming now. She felt herself, not coming, and her own body stiffened. "Oh God!" she breathed out as she came again!</p> <p>He had just fucked her, he said, and had made love to her. His cock was right in the middle of her, her whole body writhing through her own fingers. He had been doing this when she had been coming, and he knew exactly what she would feel like when she came, when she cried out and she wanted him to do that!</p> <p>"That was so, so lovely, darling," he said, his mouth sucking gently on her earlobe. He slid his hand up over her breasts, his fingertips sliding over her hard nipples, which seemed to respond positively to his touch! Oh, God! How many women can say that when they are made to come—and then come many times together?</p> <p>"I... I... I..." she gasped, trying to finish the sentence.</p> <p>"I know," he told her, sliding his hard cock out of her. As he pulled his panties off and lay back out of reach of her body, she pulled up her dress over her head, then unhooked her bra and let it fall. She stood and faced him, and then reached down with both hands and unhooked her bra right off. When she pulled it away from her, and let it fall down over her breasts and her chest, her nipples were standing up, hard as pebbles, and she took them in her fingers and rolled them between her fingers.</p> <p>"Is it lovely?" She kissed him for a while, pressing a soft hand to his chest, her long nails, so soft, running on the skin. "It's just beautiful, darling," she whispered and dropped the straps of her dress down off her shoulders to the sides of her breasts. She pushed them up over them and off her body with her back and arms. They fell to the ground in a heap, revealing the nakedness of her body to him.</p> <p>He reached out his hand and cupped her breasts, then began to rub and gently squeeze and rub at her nipples. Her back arched and her body was trembling. He pushed two fingers into her again and held there a moment, then moved his hand back up her stomach to the small of her back, and pressed it down hard into the back of her thighs. Her breathing got faster now, and she opened her legs—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
