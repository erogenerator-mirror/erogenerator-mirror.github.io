Come in."</p> <p>Trying to keep my tone steady, I went toward the room with them, and followed them in. In about a second, I was greeted by the sight of my parents from my vantage point of the door, and a look of surprise passed over their faces.</p> <p>"Tara...Tara, wait," my father began, as he quickly stepped into the room as well.</p> <p>"Who are you, Dad? What's going on?" I snapped, pulling my eyes away from him to look my father in the eyes. His cheeks still had a reddened look around them, and his eyes were tightly shut. "I know about your past..." he began, not finishing his sentence.</p> <p>"Are you still with those guys? You haven't really left the house. Come, go away."</p> <p>Taking my son by the shoulder, I walked up to the edge of the kitchen. "Tara, what did you do?"</p> <p>"We tried to find you," my sister responded. "I know a way you could have escaped to the other side, if you would have let us in."</p> <p>Looking up at me for a second with an odd look, the girl continued, "I'm not even sure if she's right. If you look over there, you'll see this little box. It's on the right side next to her door. It's the only way you'll escape."</p> <p>I knew what my mother's words sounded like, but there wasn't any logic there, either. "You heard about us?" I questioned, looking back at Kara.</p> <p>"Yeah," my sister said after I spoke. "I heard some of what you've done, and I'm sorry. It's ok though. If you need anything, get it to me."</p> <p>"Alright," I said. Seeing the seriousness on my daughter's face, I began to relax a bit. "So we could let you in? I mean. You've been through a ton of stuff, I think we can handle that."</p> <p>Tara took a hold of my shoulder. "I think it's a great idea. You're both going to be great people, there's nothing you can do that'll make it worse than living in a big house with an asshole friend." With that, she closed the door completely shut and stepped toward the room. "Well, I'm sure your father has time to help clean up."</p> <p>My hand rose to cover my face as I was approached to the door in my father's arms. "What the hell is it?"</p> <p>Kara began to speak, too tired to continue. "What in God's name are you doing?" she cried. "You're my dad."</p> <p>I felt the anger rise in my father's face. "I should have known. Now shut the hell up, you stupid bitch," he hissed with his body.</p> <p>"Fine. Give me that box," Karate girl said, her hands at the top of her dad's back. Taking a deep breath, she pushed. "I'm just going..." Before my father could finish, Kara pulled my mother into the open door.</p> <p>"Wait a second..." my mom began. "I don't want to..."</p> <p>Kara had already pushed Karate girl out of the room, but this time her arms were at my shoulders, her body shaking with anger. "What the fuck, Mom? Who's the boss here?"</p> <p>"No you don't," my daughter spat, stepping up to my father's side. "You were just a little more of a asshole to us. I know what you wanted this time. I was just the conduit for that. I'm sorry," her eyes were cold, her voice deep as it echoed in the small room. "Tara, don't be mad at us. We're not mad at her. It's just...well...damn, if you knew, you'd be happy, right?"</p> <p>"I'd rather be mad than you," Karate girl replied. "I didn't know what to do when I found out what the hell your sister got you. The way she said it, it just seemed so wrong, and..."</p> <p>Suddenly my dad grabbed her arm, grabbing it roughly. "No! It's ok, Kat," I said and I stepped back. "You didn't mean for it. It was your idea, not mine."</p> <p>I stepped off of Karate, trying to step back from him and grab his hand to stop his struggles. In the span of a second, he was pulling the rest of my dad's shirt off and tossing it to the floor with a clatter of material. The top of his chest was soaked in blood, and I realized it was my blood, that had fallen from my fingers. In the last minute, he'd grabbed my handâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
