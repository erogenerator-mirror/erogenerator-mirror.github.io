"It'll be pretty damn good...</p> <p>"That's for sure, dear."</p> <p>Chapter 9</p> <p>I came out of a meeting in my office a couple of minutes early, after another, and just a touch of anxiety. I had worked on a presentation of some kind today--it was an old client of mine. Since it was supposed to be a little after lunch, I was in there for a moment, just to calm my nerves and come over to ask around an old client of mine to make coffee for lunch. Just the idea of it made me nervous and I could tell I was going to regret it, but for some reason the thought made me feel good.</p> <p>As I walked in the door, I couldn't believe how happy I was to see her. It was funny in a way, but I found it almost hard to believe that she would be here with me. I found my nervousness rising a little bit before I felt really confident in how her presentation would go. It was going exactly as I thought it would.</p> <p>I entered the room in my business suit and tie of course, my shirt having to come off in front, but I did my best to put on what I had on, which showed some cleavage and a touch of hip. I think she took my breath away.</p> <p>"Oh, my," she said, "Thank you, Mr. Anderson. This is so much better than I thought it would be. I'd actually go to the coffee service for free today if I could get you free time to come with me, I'm so pleased!"</p> <p>"Oh, don't worry about the coffee, I don't want to be a burden on you and your wife. I'll just sit down and enjoy the coffee," I assured her.</p> <p>"Thank you," she smiled and sat down, her legs crossed and slightly parted, her beautiful eyes taking in every inch of me. I had never wanted something so much in my life, but I couldn't believe my good fortune to have met this woman and then to be in her presence. I sat down, feeling self-conscious. She was still standing, but I could still see what I remembered seeing on that morning in our bedroom back in my early years. Her eyes never left me, like they had never left mine before her; I could see they were hungry and she seemed to want me. But instead of letting me know her, she smiled her soft smile of happiness and walked me toward the door.</p> <p>"It's okay," she said brightly in her thick southern accent that I had really missed. "They don't have to stay in the hotel; the coffee will be wonderful. Come and have coffee with me, and tell me everything you remember of your old job, Mr. Anderson," she insisted. I smiled as I reached out my hand to the door, and opened the door for her. She accepted my hand and we shared a moment of quiet, deep, loving, loving, loving. It was the first time we had been more than friendly enough to be polite, and then I would have felt bad about it. I'd felt bad enough by then, but this woman was a different thing. She was so very special to me, and I felt like I could never let go of her.</p> <p>All day and all night, I could feel myself getting more and more aroused with every passing moment. This could be mine, but it looked too good to be mine. She was giving me a moment of intimacy that only she could give me, and I felt that familiar feeling of wanting to be in her presence, and only her for the rest of our lives.</p> <p>I felt guilty about having let go of my professional life, as I had done just the same with my professional life, but all I could think of was how we could move on together. We'd had coffee for both of us, maybe two times a day and she'd done so much that we hadn't really spoken or done so much together in over ten years. I think we were so lucky to have her, and that she had my heart, but there was also a feeling of sadness and anxiety in the way we held each other. I'm sure that I didn't realize how happy we could make each other feel until now, but it felt like we were making progress with each other, and maybe we were.</p> <p>Before I was finished our coffee, she walked me over to the phone. "This is so awkward," she said. "I'm a little nervous about this, but here's my number, and let me know if you want anything. I'm sure you have your personal questionsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
