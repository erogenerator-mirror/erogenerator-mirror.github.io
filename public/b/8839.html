It's no problem at all. Besides, I don't think some guy like you might have to fuck me, don't ya understand? I mean it was just a one-time thing, so I'm not exactly a prude!"</p> <p>I laughed aloud, and said, "Well, maybe you're not, but this way I'm better."</p> <p>I helped her down from the table, and we walked from the dining area to the pool, where we spent a few minutes playing in the water, before heading back towards the resort.</p> <p>Chapter 16</p> <p>On our return journey to our destination, I did have a little surprise for her. As we strolled along the deck of the resort, I noticed the light had indeed changed colors, leaving daylight strewn across the windows. The sight that greeted me this time was that of a dark silhouette above a nearby waterfall, and that of someone looking down into the pool. She certainly knew what would be coming. My plan was to wait until later, but the look she must have made in response had me ready to go at any moment.</p> <p>As I exited the cabana in my tight blue swim trunks, I saw that there must have been no other guests in the lot. So far, the sun had set, while her boyfriend had appeared nowhere to be seen. He must have spent the evening in the pool, drinking with friends or watching movies or drinking beer while they were outside. It was almost an hour later before anyone else showed up in the pool area, but it didn't take long before I heard someone calling out to their girlfriend on the cell phone. It was definitely her, so I went to get the portable phone out of my carry-on bag. There wasn't a lot of traffic in the area, and I was quite pleased with my appearance.</p> <p>I had my top hat in my hand, which I draped over my shoulders, covering my chest and head at the same time. As I watched her get out of the cabana, I couldn't help but be impressed. A lot of attractive women are going to be swimming in the pool tonight, and I was sure they will be getting more than a quick view of me. I was wearing a light blue shirt as well, and was definitely not wearing my bag, but I certainly felt it was worth it.</p> <p>I went to my computer, set it up on the table next to the window, and then followed her to the pool. She climbed out of the pool slowly, and started getting out of the water, and then joined me on the pool lounger. Our eyes met as she made her way up the lounge, and we both saw a pair of sparkling eyes, staring straight at us with undisguised lust. We had spoken several times during the day, and she seemed extremely confident, as we both stared at her.</p> <p>I took her hand in mine, and we began to walk back to our condo, our arms around each other's waist. We had just walked over the threshold, and headed inside, when she stopped suddenly, looking directly at me. "John, I know it's too forward, but I think we can work something out here."</p> <p>I nodded. "I'm all ears and everything. But if you're having second thoughts, you've got nothing to worry about."</p> <p>She gave me a devilish smile and said, "And I'm all ears and everything."</p> <p>I knew it wasn't really my place to argue, for all she was doing was helping me understand that she wanted to make a difference. It was also, for the second time, that I felt as though we had shared our own future and that we now had a chance to be together.</p> <p>After kissing her goodbye, we quickly returned to our condo, which was within walking distance of our condo, the front door being open up on the opposite side of the pool.</p> <p>We walked inside, and she immediately shed her wet clothes, leaving me naked with just my boxers. We didn't care, as I grabbed her by the waist, and pushed her back against the couch. We quickly shed that top, and her own top as well, in one swoop, leaving her completely naked except for a pair of very brief bikini panties, which were clearly designed to give her maximum exposure.</p> <p>"Fuck me now, John!" she demanded as we quickly made our way to the bedroom, where we got right in bed and started making a beeline for sex. The night before had been extremely exciting, but that was nothing compared to today.</p> <p>"Please, John. Fuck me! Now!" she ordered, her eyes flashing wantonly with pure, unabashed desire.</p> <p>I wasted no more time and pushed her back onto the bed. My throbbing member instantly found the entrance to her wet pussy, and sheâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
