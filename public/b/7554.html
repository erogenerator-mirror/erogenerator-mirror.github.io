Just do it."</p> <p>With that statement that wordlessly dropped one line to the end. I reached out my right hand and gently caressed her right arm, then began lightly grazing all over her arm, the back side, and even under the edge of her bra. My hand slipped under her arm. I lightly stroked the back of her wrist, caressed the outside of her palm, and continued the upward of her arm to softly and slowly massage to the side of her back. It was getting very intimate. I had the desire to gently squeeze her ass when her head lifted from the bed. However, I knew that it would not happen due to the fact that she was lying on her back and she was so into this particular moment. Instead, I moved onto the other side of her neck and lightly stroked as I had the first time we had done it. I continued to softly and gently caress the back of her shoulder, followed by trailing down towards her shoulder in small deliberate patterns. This motion caused her to softly squirm. This was an experience I would soon learn to enjoy. I started lightly caressing the area behind her ear. I moved my hand forward until it came to her front. I began lightly running my fingers up and down her exposed midriff. She was clearly enjoying this by the reaction I was getting from her. I stopped before I touched her underwear. My fingers felt smooth and silky, and it was like I had been touching myself while watching Amy as I was stroking Kate.</p> <p>"You okay?" I asked as I stroked her right forearm, then her left.</p> <p>"Mmm. I'm good. I like it," she said while lightly stroking up and down my arm.</p> <p>"Are you doing anything else?"</p> <p>"Mmm," she replied. I ran my fingers all over her panties, then around her thigh, then lightly stroked her through them. I looked into her eyes and moved to gently kiss her. I gently pressed my lips to hers when she responded and the kiss lasted a good 30 seconds. We both stopped kissing. We looked at each other's eyes for a while and then I asked, "Are you sure you're okay?"</p> <p>"I'm great. I want you to do something for me. You look so beautiful laying there."</p> <p>"That seems like a good idea. How about when we get back from the party?"</p> <p>"Mmm, it's fine," she replied. We kissed again, again with passion. Her leg remained draped over mine as I stroked her thigh beneath her skirt. As we kissed, I reached my hand underneath her skirt to her panties and lightly began stroking her bare pussy. When she moaned a bit, she reached out and softly took my wrist when she moved my hand downward. While her legs weren't spread as widely as they probably should, they were still open and easily visible through her taffeta panty fabric.</p> <p>She continued to massage my thigh as she kissed me. When she came to my lips again, her lips moved to my ear as she said, "It's not really the same here." I smiled and kissed her more deeply. Soon, we took our time undressing each other. As we did, I gently pushed her back toward the bed, then quickly sat beside her as I removed her taffeta panties and the bra. She smiled at me then pulled me on top of her on the bed as she put her hands behind her neck so I could quickly remove her taffeta top and her panties leaving her completely nude from the waist up. I sat atop her and began kissing her again. As I slid closer to her, her breasts brushed my body as a soft sigh escaped her lips. I continued to kiss her as I removed her teddy exposing her ample breasts, which I took in my hands and squeezed gently. The sensation of her skin caused me to take another step forward, and I placed my lips on her left nipple.</p> <p>This was all so new to me. She usually liked me to gently suck on her areola as much as I could. However, I was much more experienced with receiving oral sex. I lightly nibbled my way around her areola as I moved to the right nipple. This was followed by a similar attention to the left as we kissed and tongued each other for a few minutes. All the while, my hands caressed her skin lightly, as if to emphasize the experience. As I kissed her upper chest and worked my way down to her stomach, I felt like I had just reached paradise. Her flat abdomen was soft, but not toned like the other women I had been with. She lay still for a few seconds while I enjoyed her wonderful body. After a while, her hands once again came to my neck and made contact with her head.</p> <p>"That's nice," she said when I lightlyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
