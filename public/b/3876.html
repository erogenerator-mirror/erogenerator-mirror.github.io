I like it big. I like big." she thought, then she looked back at his face and imagined his big hands sliding underneath her, pulling her tight against his big cock. She wondered if she could do it. Could she give up this fantasy? Would she do it, just now? He wouldn't push her away. The thought of him sucking her cock was turning her on, too. Why had he changed his mind? It sure hadn't changed how she had started it, but it would change her life. She could try it.</p> <p>"I want you to cum inside me, Steve," she said.</p> <p>"I'll do it, baby," he said.</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>There was a knock on the door.</p> <p>"Come," she said.</p> <p>And he opened the door. It was a tall man. He was not dressed the way she had imagined. He looked like the movie character in the movie. She got a glimpse of that big cock, too. He stepped aside and invited the man in. She couldn't help but stare at that huge, muscular butt as it swung. Steve was in his mid-thirties, a man she would have been good at fucking but was not exactly fond of. His clothes certainly weren't all that fancy. The man was smiling, at least a little.</p> <p>"How long are you there, Steve?" she asked again as Steve led the stranger through the main bedroom. Steve's cock was getting hard again. He had told her something like this, but had she ever considered it?</p> <p>The man in the door looked up. He was in his early forties and had dark brown hair that fell in ringlets. "Yes, what the hell is that all about?" he said. "We're alone here. I'm sorry. Is this someone you're talking to?"</p> <p>"Yes," said Steve. "This is Carol. Carol, this is Steve."</p> <p>"Hi, Steve. It's nice to meet you. May I get you a beer?"</p> <p>"I'd like that, but Carol's got to run," Steve said and closed the door.</p> <p>"He's not the stud I thought he was!" smiled Steve again.</p> <p>He was a pretty good dancer, one of the guys said. And he did everything.</p> <p>"Maybe it's because he's not a stud like you two. And he's not hung like you. I don't know."</p> <p>Steve walked across the room and sat on the side of the tub. "Steve wants you to do me a favor." He took off her shoes and shoes and laid them in the tub. He then slid her panties off her legs. He pulled her close to him and kissed her.</p> <p>His mouth moved to her neck. His tongue traced its way to her neck and up her neck. She moaned as he tongued her. Steve began to slide down the tub to the water. He began to remove his shirt and slid it off. He rubbed her breasts against his chest as he licked her throat. He slid his hands down her chest to her hips and slid them into her panties. She lifted up so he could slide her panties down and off her legs.</p> <p>Steve began to move around her in the tub. He sat on the side as he began to slide her panties down. As her panties slid to her ankles, his eyes were drawn to her huge, beautiful tits. Steve put his hands on them, massaged his fingers on the underside of her breasts. He ran his tongue over her nipples and her moaned. He slowly slid his pants and underwear to the floor, leaving the only part of him that she wore that she didn't wear a bra. Steve pulled up her legs and slowly slid them from the floor. He looked at her pussy, dripping with her own pussy juice.</p> <p>"You are as beautiful as you look." He said to her while he ran his fingers through her bush, feeling the heat, the wetness that came with sex. "I really do love a hairy pussy!"</p> <p>He had her lay down on the side of the tub as he removed his pants and underwear and sat on the side. He put one knee behind her thigh and began to kiss and lick her pussy from top to bottom. She moaned as he found the bud of her clitoris and continued his attentions. Steve began to lick and flick her clit as he slid two fingers into a warm, wet pussy.</p> <p>She arched her back, wanting to feel his fingers in her. "Steve, you're driving me crazy. It feels so good. It's soâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
