"You make me feel comfortable with you, Mike."</p> <p>"You make me feel comfortable with you even with knowing that it's going to be one of those days when we'll be together again."</p> <p>"Is that too soon, Mike? It's been a long time since we've had any time together."</p> <p>"And it's almost three years now, isn't it?"</p> <p>"It's been so long since we've had time to sit and talk and have fun with each other."</p> <p>"So...you and me...together?"</p> <p>"You've got me."</p> <p>"It's been a long time. I'll be honest, I'm not sure just how we'll get together, exactly. But I promise I won't take anything more from you than it's been that long."</p> <p>"Me, too. Don't be so sure. It's been a while since I've had a chance to just talk about us together or even just say the words."</p> <p>"And all it's been is two days of silence?"</p> <p>She looked at him with her hands on her hips, then looked back at him. "I can never say it any louder than that, Mike. But I really need to, at least, to let you know that. I think I'm falling in love with you."</p> <p>His eyes got serious as he looked at her. "What?"</p> <p>"You're the reason I've been wanting to try and have a relationship with people while we're apart. I think I've fallen under the spell of being more open around you and trying to make everything okay again. I'll give you that, but, Mike, is that even a possibility? It's never been that easy for me. We've been hanging out here at the apartment a lot, just because of how we'd gotten there and the fact that there wasn't a phone line outside all of those windows. And that would be the worst thing to happen. And maybe, I'm afraid that if we started to date, that it would ruin what we have."</p> <p>"I was the one who suggested we just let it happen, after all. Besides, you had no sense of how you felt about our relationship at any point of time, and we didn't have to wait any longer. And I certainly wasn't either. After the weekend we'd had, I was more ready to be part of something together than just a friend. And I really wanted us to really become a couple. I realized that, in some part of the time we'd been together, I'd be really looking beyond my initial plan of just to see a nice guy and a woman before the whole process was over."</p> <p>"You didn't think of that?"</p> <p>"Sure, I did. I wanted to take part in everything. But I wasn't sure, especially after the Friday night before and Saturday morning before that, that I was really ready for it."</p> <p>"And yet, there you are," he said as he looked at her and sighed. "No wonder it's been so damn long for you."</p> <p>"I know, right? I've been having sex with my boyfriend for what seems like forever. And the sex is fun and so is our relationship. And now, we're really in the middle of it. But...I just...I don't know what to think about this new arrangement."</p> <p>"Mike, I love you," said his heart pounding as he stood up to embrace her, "I want to do everything and anything I can to help you realize these things. I really do. You just don't think that I was trying to force myself on you to make the first move, do you?"</p> <p>"Nope. No way in hell am I going to make a move like this before I'm a hundred fold, Mike. I've always known that it wasn't going to happen; so I never stopped trying."</p> <p>"Good for you. It's not as if you don't understand, even with all the little things you've done already. I love you too, Gina, and I wouldn't have anything else to do with you."</p> <p>He hugged her a little tighter than before. They kissed quickly. And he loved the sensation that she still had there after making a decision. It didn't take long for him to get hard again. They went into the bedroom and quickly undressed, before he dropped to his knees in the dark in front of her. They kissed and he slowly licked her from her clit to her puckered ass. She shuddered a little and he pulled back for a moment, her mouth opened a little.</p> <p>"Are you ready for this, Mike?"</p> <p>"Ready as I'll ever be," he said with a laugh.</p> <p>"I'm readyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
