I lifted her onto the dining room table and spread her legs as I sat before her, her skirt raised up her body.</p> <p>"Open those legs," I commanded, and she lifted each one to my hips and spread them open. I slipped the fingers of one hand between the wet folds of her pussy and pushed my middle finger gently into her. "Mmm!" she moaned, "That's nice. Are you wet, Mrs. H., and are you ready to come for me?"</p> <p>I slipped the finger in and out while I spoke, slowly rubbing her g-spot as she groaned softly in both pleasure and pain. She seemed to be on the edge, her body trembling with her orgasm. "Just wait," I hissed at her as I slipped another finger into her.</p> <p>Her breath caught in her throat at the unexpected invasion of pleasure. I twisted the fingers in her and she moaned softly, "Oh my god, oh my god," as the first wave of her orgasm began to sweep her. She had her head thrown back, her hair tickled her face, and her eyes closed as if in bliss. I pulled my fingers out and slipped them into my mouth. She was wet and slippery, and her taste was musky and sweet. I reached up and cupped each breast in my hands and rolled the nipples between my thumb and forefinger.</p> <p>She opened her eyes and looked over at me with lust in her gorgeous eyes. "Oh, you like my tits," she hissed, "You like my tits, don't you?"</p> <p>I smiled as I stood up and kissed her, sliding my tongue slowly over hers for which she moaned and opened her lips wider for me. Our bodies pressed together as we kissed, our fingers exploring each other's bodies as we worked each other's flesh to the point of no return. I felt her heart beat against my chest as she ground her hips urgently, moving back against me.</p> <p>She reached down and guided my hardness again into her, lifting up a little so that it found the opening of her womanhood. She was slick and wet, and it was as if two people fucking was a natural progression from one into another as they made love, the way a woman moves in rhythm to the sex. Her hips rose to meet mine as she ground her aching mound against me. I felt the heat and wetness that accompanied an impending orgasm as the walls tightened around my cock.</p> <p>I felt how tight she was, so incredibly soft that I loved it. The skin of her pussy enveloped me so well, it felt like I was inside her even though it probably wasn't. I felt her pulse against me as she started to rise and fall, her motion quickening the pace of our fucking.</p> <p>Her mouth opened in a soundless cry. Her eyes fluttered shut and her hands gripped my shoulders. I could see the strain in her face as her back arched and her breasts shook with the force of her climax. Her body trembled as the sensation overwhelmed her, and the strength of her climax was incredible.</p> <p>"I was afraid that it was too soon," she whispered to me as she came down from her high.</p> <p>I smiled at her. "A woman can never be too ready," I told her and kissed her once more, then stood up and went to the laundry room.</p> <p>When I returned, Mrs. H. was kneeling at the edge of the bed, panting for breath. I helped her up and she knelt with her breasts in my hands.</p> <p>"Do you know what would make it better," I said to her, "just by having one of your fingers in me, I could have an orgasm of my ownâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
