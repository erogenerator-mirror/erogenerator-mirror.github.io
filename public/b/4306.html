You feel one of my hands leave my breast to stroke it as my tongue continues its journey downwards. You want to feel more of my body and this is another step in my journey to your body. It touches you, runs over you and brings tingles to your skin at its touch. Your breast, your pussy and even your clit are more sensitive and can send you over the edge.</p> <p>Your lips part and I feel your wet tongue on me, your tongue dancing over my lips and pushing its way into me to tickle the skin. You press your body down onto mine and I can feel your sex pressing against my leg, your breasts squashed between us, but the two of us still sharing your desire. It sends your body tingling and you want more. Instead your hips move up and down, pushing them against my knee, your thighs sliding open to welcome me. I can sense this and you feel the juices on your pussy begin to run.</p> <p>You can't believe this is happening. What a turn on you were to have someone want to touch you like this.</p> <p>I'm so turned on from your attentions it only takes a few seconds for me to come and then I lay back and take in the sights before my eyes. As much as I wanted to wait to take you in my mouth, I couldn't. As you lay back and enjoyed the scenery, my eyes were drawn to your breasts and what they looked like. Your legs wrapped around my waist just as I had, but with a softer feel, not your usual stroking but with the softness of your body against mine.</p> <p>You begin to move your hips against me again, moving with more confidence than the first time. You know what I like and what to do next so that we can have more fun together. You know that I want to be your partner and that we both need this.</p> <p>I can feel you are starting to get close at that point and slowly, as you continue to thrust your breasts against me I take hold of your hand and begin running it over my erection.</p> <p>You don't try to hide your arousal so your eyes meet mine as your fingers run lightly over the underside of my penis. When your finger starts to rub back and forth over my slit, I take a deep breath and groan involuntarily against your breast.</p> <p>Your fingers on my cock begin to work their way back and forth across me and when I groan your other hand comes up, running along my chest and then down my stomach and over my stomach. Your breathing is becoming faster and harder as my lips go back to kissing you, tasting your mouth with tongues, sucking hard on your lower lip.</p> <p>I feel you raise yourself up onto your knees and start pushing down my body. It's so exciting that you aren't sure what you're doing, but it makes you want me to lie down with you. When I'm positioned where you want me and can take your weight on your knees and arms, I kiss your lips, taking in every inch of your face. Your face, but your eyes. Your lips. Your eyes. Your mouth. Your tongue. Your tits.</p> <p>I know what you want, but at the same time it's more than just giving yourself to me. Your moans, your breathing that's getting more pronounced, your body rocking slightly back and forth, you're not even breathing. I feel your hand running up and down my stomach and then along my thighs, feeling my excitement rising again.</p> <p>Finally, I feel your hands on my cock and you run your fingers up and down its length. When my head goes back, your eyes meet mine.</p> <p>"Are you ready to share all this with your friend?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes," you tell me and press down hard on my stomach.</p> <p>And suddenly you pull off of me in one easy, motion. You don't pause, don't hesitate. As soon as we get back to lying down, you kiss on my lips the insides of my cheeks and my chin, then kiss down my neck to my chest.</p> <p>My hands begin to move over your body as my lips follow your kisses to your breasts, your stomach and on down your body. When you reach down to take me again in your hand, I can feel the bed shaking from the movement. As you feel me hardening in your hand, I feel the movement of your fingers going down to your pussy.</p> <p>You are on your back just above me and I'm still on my knees, my arms still around you. Your legs are around my hips and I feel your sex and it turns you on more. It's as though your body wants to make itself known where I'm going.</p> <p>Your breathing comes back towards something approaching excitement and I can sense your body starting to shake and throb against my own. You can feel the movement against your thighâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
