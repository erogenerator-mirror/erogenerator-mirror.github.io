I am so much older than you really are. You look a little too old for you, you don't look much older, but I know, in all reality, you will grow into everything that can go along with your beauty.</p> <p>It doesn't hurt that you are wearing a long, red satin robe, a long strand of pearls between your collar and your lovely hair, and your lovely figure is accentuated wonderfully by the long hem of the robe. You look so sexy you should be completely at home in the big city, instead of in a tiny hotel room.</p> <p>So when you are ready, just go to them, and tell them that you are ready. Then you can wear the same robe you wore to the prom.</p> <p>If for some reason, you don't want to be married in the near future, you can just ask me.</p> <p>Well, I can't be sure. I suppose the thing that I'm sure of is that I will marry Molly tomorrow night when the morning dawns.</p> <p>You've told me that you really want me, all of me, to be in the city tomorrow night, tomorrow night, and I can promise you a whole new experience, don't I, Molly? Would you like that?</p> <p>You just look at me, look at me with some real hope, then you say,</p> <p>"Yes!"</p> <p></p> <p>I'm afraid that I might as well just do it. The world won't end just yet, anyway, so go ahead and pick it up, start making the reservations for our honeymoon, and then make it to our favorite spot tomorrow, maybe there will still be a little party at our favorite beach.</p> <p>You're too old for parties, and anyway, you can take care of yourself. That's your job, for now. It is something which will work itself out as we wind down our honeymoon. The first couple of days will be the usual, the first night that you would probably be alone with me, or at the company picnic, maybe dancing a little, or just relaxing in your warm bed.</p> <p>The weekend will be fantastic. You're always ready for me. We have no trouble getting home at all. I can't wait to make love to you tomorrow, or the weekend, as well. And you won't need to wait for me. I'll take good care of you from now on.</p> <p>Of course, the most important thing is, you aren't my husband. You are as much my husband as you are mine, and you might as well use your gift in one way or another so that when we have sex, I don't worry about leaving anything of yours.</p> <p>Your gift is that you can have children with me, or, or whatever's the term, I won't be a daddy when the weekend comes. I'll be happily with you and will have a great future.</p> <p>Have a good time, and you'll feel even better tomorrow, and this wonderful night together. I'll call you on Tuesday and Saturday after our honeymoon if you want, and call me on Monday and Sunday.</p> <p>I'll call you on Monday. I'll call you on Monday.</p> <p>Molly and Jake are waiting for you, and I'm about to give you a very special gift tomorrow.</p> <p>Molly says, "When are you leaving?"</p> <p></p> <p>I give Molly a kiss and tell her, "We are going to the restaurant, tomorrow night, right after we eat, and you will go home early. There are still some things that have to happen. Like today, last night. We have plans for you afterwards, right after breakfast, okay?"</p> <p>This time she does not need to answer, she kisses me hard, and says, "I'll see you in the future, Jake, do me a big favor, come tomorrow whenever you want to get away from school and get away from school to get married. Then come home early. I'll still need to worry about a good job before we get married tomorrow."</p> <p></p> <p>All her plans have come together, and she'll be back to school Monday, and be all right.</p> <p>And so Molly and I get together on Tuesday and Tuesday, and spend a wonderful evening together.</p> <p>The wedding is held in June of the next year, with Molly doing the reception, and the wedding's in May of the year. Then we go to the apartment of our parents which is just past our family's town limits. It has been a couple of years since Molly and I've been on a date together, and Molly never lets it stop.</p> <p>When we go to the apartment after dinner, she wants me to get a freshâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
