I was pretty buzzed too, but felt no obligation to take any precautions to avoid them - I was just glad to have it to myself. The next morning was Sunday, so it wasn't quite as fun as we'd hoped. At breakfast that morning, Lisa announced she was going out a couple of weeks early and I could make myself at home. Lisa gave me back my coffee, but I didn't even notice when she got up. She wore a short silk robe, tied around her chest, so that it exposed her breasts, and showed off just enough of her cleavage. I could see that she was really showing off and she knew it.</p> <p>"I'm going to the club for a couple of hours," she announced. "That's when I need an encore. I love to dance and I'm feeling kinda tired right now. Would you mind waiting?"</p> <p>"Sure, let me check." I stood up too, and after a few feet she followed, carrying a bunch of stuff with her. "How many people are there?" I asked.</p> <p>"Oh, a lot." When she came back, and handed me back my coffee, she was wearing a nice sleeveless top, so the top plunged lower on her bust. I noticed that it was a little short, at first, but it didn't seem to affect the rest of her body, as she kept walking toward the dance-floor, which I noticed when she stopped and turned.</p> <p>"Oh, I'm going to miss it when I do come back. I'm not sure I want it to be over too soon. Here. Take this, I'll take care of it."</p> <p>Lisa turned and bent over the bar. Her robe slipped open as she did so, so I could clearly see the soft curve of her breasts -- then there were two perfect globes of flesh, which I could actually see, and she could feel it. I watched in amazement as Lisa swayed her hips from side to side, a sort of back and forth wiggle, as she walked to the next table.</p> <p>"This is a little better," she said as she passed me another glass, filled it, and sat down. The two of us sipped our drink, drinking a bit more. I didn't feel like taking my eyes off Lisa's figure, and noticed that a lot of the girls on the floor just gave each other a disapproving stare as they watched the women dancing.</p> <p>"This is so much fun," Lisa said as she smiled to herself, and reached her hand out to me, putting it on the table in front of her. I stood up and handed her my cup too, and she drank, too. Then, just as the last sip came, she stood up to do my drink. My face did not change, except for the slight burn from excitement, and I took a long draw of my drink. I handed it back to her, and she brought my cup back to me, as she bent over to take mine.</p> <p>We laughed, and she put her arms around me, and we kissed, gently, slowly, passionately. Her body was firm, and there was just enough of her breast to squeeze into my robe, and her arm was over my shoulder, just caressing my back and my ass. It sent a thrill through me and I could feel her cock hardening under her robe, which felt as though it might break against her skin.</p> <p>"You know," she said, "we really should have a beer before we go."</p> <p>I stood up and we walked towards the bar. Lisa was as drunk as ever, and was leaning into me, with her arms around my neck, pressing her breasts against me. Our kisses became more passionate and as we walked, our hands were at each others waist. My robe rose at her knees, exposing her thighs almost entirely, then I could feel her press against my own crotch. I reached behind her with my other hand, feeling the swell of her cock as she pushed against me. The robe felt really nice on her, and my cock responded immediately, pressing against her crotch, like a tent pole. Her robe opened up nicely, revealing a little more than she'd normally be without it.</p> <p>Our hands found each other's ass. Lisa ran her long strong fingers up my back. She rubbed at the firm roundness there, then lifted her arms up to pull my robe open to reveal my chest and breasts and her own firm roundness against me. I felt the robe loosen around my waist as my arms rose to her waist, and her other hand found its way between us, to me, caressing my butt then caressing the top of my tits. My nipples responded, and were hard and erect. I think it was the sensation of being pressed against someone's breastsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
