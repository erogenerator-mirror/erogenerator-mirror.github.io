I asked, my fingers beginning to get tired.</p> <p>"How you've been," she murmured without looking up.</p> <p>I smiled. "I should be happy that I'm home."</p> <p>"I'm not," she said, "and besides, I need your help to drive me downtown."</p> <p>"Why don't you stop in and pick up a car?" I asked, already getting tired of the road around here and looking for a better place.</p> <p>"Do you want to see anything? You can keep the place up for a day if you want," she suggested.</p> <p>"That's not really a problem," I said, "I can see a couple of other things down a few streets."</p> <p>"But you don't need anything other than a car," she said.</p> <p>I looked up into a nearby town. "Here I am and it's just up ahead. What about you?"</p> <p>"I need you to pick me up at the door tonight," she said, "because it's a little after nine."</p> <p>My heart started to pound again, knowing that she was lying, but not knowing exactly why, because she didn't know exactly who she was talking with. After a moment she said, "Let's go see if there's anything you want."</p> <p>"We can't," I replied, surprised she still believed me. "Do what you want and you can come back later with me."</p> <p>"I still need to talk to you about what happened," she said.</p> <p>"Please come see me tomorrow," I said. "Come meet me and you can just drive." I pulled on my shirt and jeans and walked through my house and to my car. This part of town was mostly just up ahead and wasn't busy or a great place to stop for a drink. I got in and turned around.</p> <p>"Look," Tina said, stepping from her chair, "I'm glad you're not going to stop here to come."</p> <p>"I guess you just think I'm not interested." I said. As she reached over, took a finger that held my chin and made me look up at her, "I know you want this but you can't have it." She pulled her hand back and looked down.</p> <p>"No," she said. "My sister wouldn't do that. She'd never do that."</p> <p>"No, she won't!" I said. "She wouldn't. We can talk about everything."</p> <p>"Come on, you," she encouraged.</p> <p>"I can't," I said. "I'll do it if you help me." I looked up and saw the woman beside me shaking her head.</p> <p>"I'm so glad we are friends," she said. "I don't really care what happens between you and her. She just wants to be with you and, because you brought it up, I guess I need to know before I give you the green light." She sighed, looked down at my hand.</p> <p>"Let's go see if something else happened," I finally said. "I think that's a good plan."</p> <p>She nodded and led me to her car. We sat for a few minutes and I tried to think of a good reason to let her do this. But after a lot of thought we came to a conclusion. "If we were to become friends, we could do this," I said.</p> <p>"If we were to start trying to do it, there'd be no turning back," Tina said. "We're too far apart in our attitudes to go back."</p> <p>"It's not that," I said. "I just don't see us as friends in the next few minutes. Even if we were to become good friends."</p> <p>I saw Tina's head move and I saw her lips close together. "Do you want to?" she whispered. "Because if you really want to, we can have as much to talk about as would like." She gave me a nervous smile.</p> <p>"I think I should go," I said. I got up without saying a word and I followed her up to the front door. "So I'm going to do this?" I said, hoping she wouldn't mind so I could take my leave.</p> <p>"Can I buy you lunch?" she asked as her head popped through the door.</p> <p>"Sure," I said. "How would you like one?"</p> <p>"Why don't you go get it, and we can stop down there," she told me. "You don't have to come back though."</p> <p>"I don't want to go back without going somewhereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
