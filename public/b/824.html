Slowly she got up, and he got his balance, allowing her to kneel next to him. She leaned over him, placed her hands on the bed next to his and slowly lowered her mouth down on him, sucking the head in. Her tongue twirled around the underside of his dick as she held it straight up. "God, you feel fucking gooooooood." His hands ran through her hair as she bobbed up and down on his length. His fingers found her head, and he held her in place with his other hand, feeling the silky feel of her warm mouth wrapped around him. He ran his hand through the hair on top her head as he watched her lips slide up and down on him. He could smell her sweet smell that he had missed so much the last two nights, and he could not feel himself missing this. He pushed his other hand down into the sheets to help as well.</p> <p>Sarah was still sucking on him, but now she was taking the head fully into her mouth. He watched, his hand coming up to trace over her chin. The blonde head moving steadily, her hands tightening and relaxing the grip that she had on him. Sarah looked up at him with a grin, her head bobbing, her tongue running over his cock as she sucked.</p> <p>"Oh God" he sighed as she finally made the slow rise back up. The feeling of her lips against him, her tongue licking at him, the suction of her mouth on his cock, it was indescribable.</p> <p>His cock twitched in her mouth as she rose back up again, letting the head pop out of her mouth. The blonde head rose up and back in a long "oh" and then her eyes snapped back down at him, giving him a smile. He was watching her with wide eyes as she looked down at him, at the cock she was looking at, she loved sucking him. It seemed so natural, his sister-in-law. With a soft grin she opened her mouth and brought her lips down close again, sucking her lips off. This time he was watching her and he could feel himself twitch again.</p> <p>She pulled back up on her own and got a grin, looking down at him as she did. He could see that she was not really looking directly at him, but was focused on the cock she was watching. The tip of his member slid past her tongue, her head slightly bobbing back and forth. He felt his cock twitch again, and his hand came across to her neck.</p> <p>"Holy FUCK!" he said breathless, her lips and her cheeks. He gently pushed them off as she moved her mouth back up to his, her breasts bobbing and her eyes watching him. He wrapped his hand around her throat, gently squeezing as she leaned closer to him. He could feel her tongue slide out to make wet sounds as he did so. The soft moan that she let out as his finger slid into her mouth brought him so close. Without any other words he pulled her down to him, her lips moving up onto his lips as she kissed him, his hand sliding down her body to the soft mound of hair covering her groin.</p> <p>His other hand moved up to her breast, rubbing it, feeling the softness of it. His fingers found the erect little nub of the nipple that was standing out above, and he gently pulled on it in his hand. The blonde squirmed as her brother-in-law's thumb teased along her sensitive nub. Sarah's head lowered, her tongue playing against his as he slid her panties down around her leg. He watched her as she looked up at him with that smile that would be etched on his body. His hand moved to the back of her head, pulling her downward just a little bit as she moved down. His cock was aching for her as he held her by her hair so he could watch her make love. He watched her mouth moving up and down, and even more so when he could swear that the head of his cock was disappearing into her mouth.</p> <p>Sarah moved her mouth back up his shaft, just a little lower this time. He could feel her tongue tickling the tip of him that way, making the journey up and down the top of him. "Oh, god." He could feel the soft smooth lips of her mouth around him, her wet tongue sliding over his shaft as her thumb flicked along his knob.</p> <p>She let his cock out of her mouth, the top of his head just covering the tip, letting him lick her upper lip as his tongue slid out into her mouth.</p> <p>"Fuck!" he thought as Sarah's mouth returned to him, her teeth gripping his shaft, making his head jerk. Sarah looked up at him, her green eyes looking into his blue ones.
