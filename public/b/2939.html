As I stroked her, her tongue slithered out and found my clit, which she sucked gently with the tips of her licks.</p> <p>I thought, "I'd love to have you sucking my clit as well as yours sucking my cunt," but the thought disappeared as she continued to lick and suck, her tongue driving me over the top with an unexpected and intense burst of ecstasy, that seemed to last and only to heighten my approaching orgasm until my body arched upwards and my pussy squirted out on her face. A wave of delight swept through my body as an intense wave of intense pleasure took me through the roof, and I felt my cunt spasm as it did, and, at the same time as the first spasm of passion, the first wave of a powerful climax overwhelmed me. I couldn't be sure if my body could actually stay upright at least until my orgasm was finished.</p> <p>We kissed all over, her licking the last drops of my cum, then she lay beside me. We cuddled and laughed and played with each other's bodies. In no time we had come back to life again, and I felt wonderfully sexy as I told Emma about what I'd done with Tracy. "We fucked," she told me. "Oh, God, you were fantastic."</p> <p>"I have to tell you that just got me more horny than usual from a combination of the experience, and the alcohol. I had no idea this could be such an erotic experience," I said. "And it didn't last long, did it?"</p> <p>"No, you didn't," she replied. "We had a long leisurely drive, and came again, and again and again." And even when I was sober, I would always think of her as more of a woman, and I would never suspect what she would be like if her husband or lover had been a man.</p> <p>She lay like that for a couple of hours, sometimes whispering to me about what had happened or if she was doing it right, and sometimes stroking my body all over with her fingers. The next day, in her room, she brought me to climax again and again, and I could feel my cunt squeezing and throbbing with the orgasm, even as I thought of it. But it was so easy to imagine it was someone else's, and just like to imagine it, I knew that Tracy just wanted to fuck whenever she felt like it.</p> <p>Tracy had come back to life last night, and was a very good kisser. And she always liked to suck me to climax gently, but never really gave me much or the kind of pleasure I would've believed I would ever get from sucking on a man's cock. After we broke the connection, but having a bit of a reprieve of sorts, we sat and watched a movie in the living room. When it was over and Tracy went a bit to bed again, we went our separate ways, and stayed up a bit longer.</p> <p>Tracy was having difficulty getting to sleep again, so we decided to sleep together. She lay on her side and said, "I've got to pee, I've come like a horse."</p> <p>"No, no that's okay," I said. "Stay right where you are."</p> <p>Tracy stood up and turned around. "No pee yet?"</p> <p>"No, I don't think so. I've got to go to the bathroom."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Sure. You can pee on me when I've got a bit of time."</p> <p>"That's better."</p> <p>When I'd gone through the bathroom door, I said, "Have fun." Then I went to lay down on the bed again.</p> <p>"That's better," she murmured.</p> <p>I started to get up and she said, "Wait. Let me pee, you can use the toilet. I need this, too."</p> <p>It took a while to pee but when I finally did, I thought I could feel it streaming out of me. It still felt a bit like a good old piss. So I took the opportunity to turn around.</p> <p>She stood at the side of me, her leg propping up on the toilet seat, her hand holding the end of the golden water.</p> <p>She looked me in the eyes, and said, "Don't move. Go to sleep now. Let me pee in your face."</p> <p>When I opened my eyes for a moment, I couldn't tell where she was going, but she was aiming right at me.
