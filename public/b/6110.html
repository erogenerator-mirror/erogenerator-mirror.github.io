"What are you doing?" she asked, her eyes wide with fear.</p> <p>"Shh, we've both been through a little." John, said with a huge smile.</p> <p>As Tanya turned to look at Bill again, he reached out and put his hand on her shoulder. "I'll go away." Tanya tried to pull away, but Bill grabbed her again, turning her face back to him. As Tanya reached for the light switch his hand reached forward and lightly pressed hers away from her grasp. When Tanya turned to look at him again Bill leaned into Tanya and kissed her.</p> <p>When Tanya felt Bill place his lips to hers and begin to slowly push their wet mouths together, she could feel it getting harder for her. Bill felt Tanya's lips against his and as he pulled on her mouth he let Tanya feel his tongue working to her lips, feeling her body heat up.</p> <p>When Bill's tongue slipped down and began slipping into Tanya's mouth, she pulled back and looked into his eyes, waiting for answers.</p> <p>Tanya could feel Bill's hands on her stomach and back of her shoulders. "No." she said.</p> <p>"I...I'm going to." John said.</p> <p>"I'm going to what?" Tanya asked, her stomach fluttering a bit as the realization hit her.</p> <p>"I am going to fuck her." Bill said. "Do you know what that means?" Bill said and as Tanya's mind began to come back on track she nodded and then realized that Bill's words were true.</p> <p>Tanya's mind began to race; all she could do was look down at Bills kiss through the rain and at her husband. As her mind finally came back on track she could see that John's cock had become erect now that Tanya had turned to see it coming out of Bill's pants.</p> <p>Bill felt Tanya's hand slide from his face and down his chest to his groin. "It's still wet." she said to Bill. "I can have my shirt taken off."</p> <p>Bill got a sly grin on his face and picked up her shirt and helped her to off of the porch. When he sat her back down on the bench Bill pushed Tanya back, taking hold of the wet panties and putting them in her mouth. "I don't think this is over." he said. Laying back on the bench he let Tanya stand on her tiptoes, then he pushed her down on all fours until her head was in front of him. As he began to pull off his tshirt he watched Tanya's face as he got the shirt off. When Tanya lifted her head, Bill could see the look on her face as he turned Tanya's eyes toward him. "Please" Tanya said in a scared voice. "I want you here."</p> <p>As Bill's shirt slid from his arms, Tanya reached out, taking hold of his hands and pulled them down to her waist. "No." Bill told her. Tanya put her own hands on his, stopping her from pulling up his pants. "No." she said. "Please just fuck me." Tanya pleaded as she tried turning towards Bill. "Fuck us." she said again. "Fuck us with that cock of yours." She looked back at Bill and could only imagine what sort of cock this was or how large it must be and at one point Bill's cock was rock hard so that was all she could take. She pushed him onto his back on the bench and straddled him and lowered her pussy on to his hard on at the same time.</p> <p>Bill took hold of Tanya's hips and lifted her higher so that he could feel her pussy lips on his cock. Tanya reached down taking hold of his legs, steading herself on him and pulling him harder against her. As Bill began to thrust, Tanya's mouth fell open, almost trying to scream out, but Bill grabbed Tanya's hair and pulled her lips down to him and began kissing her passionately. At the same time he slipped his hands up under her shirt and began to finger her nipples and to pull her hard nipples between his thumb and forefinger.</p> <p>When Tanya arched her back and began to bounce on Bill's cock, which was inching its way up her wet pussy she looked past him and watched John's cock disappear into her husband. John pushed his thumb into Tanya's mouth and began to massage the inside of her mouth with his tongue as she fucked him hard on the bench as if she wanted him inside her. Bill could feel the tightness of her pussy clamping down on his thickened meat and could feel her trying to pull him deeper inside her, forcing his thick cock as far inside her as she could get.</p> <p>Bill began to kiss Tanyaâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
