He couldn’t take it anymore. They had to do this. He grabbed her wrist and pulled her hand off his cock, and threw the keycard in her.</p> <p>He grabbed her hand again and started pulling the zipper of her skirt down. He pulled it all the way to her thighs and she stepped out of it. It was so tight he felt his cock pressing against her as she stepped back into the living room and kicked her skirt off onto the floor. She stood back, and he took both of her hands and led her upstairs to the bedroom. "Come on!" she exclaimed.</p> <p>He pushed her onto the bed and quickly pulled her thong off. "You're a natural," he said as he dove onto her and began licking her clit. She was still wearing her heels. She moaned. She pulled his head over her pussy with her thighs on his upstroke. Her clit was swollen and she could feel a tingle in her body. She arched upwards to meet his tongue as he plunged his tongue into her cunt. He licked and licked, and she was going crazy. When he finally took her clit into his mouth, she was bucking and shaking.</p> <p>She felt a pressure and release of tension on her body as the orgasm overcame her. He sucked on her clit, and pulled away. She turned on her back, and he climbed on top of her. He looked down at her, and she saw his face grinning as he began kissing her again. The passion of their sex was still strong in their kiss, but it was gentler at the same time.</p> <p>She could feel his erection pressing against her, and it felt so strange. He was looking down at her as his cock pushed back against her.</p> <p>"I have to taste you," he whispered in her ear.</p> <p>She grinned. "And you have to eat me," she said.</p> <p>He smiled and pressed his cock between her legs as he lay on top of her, feeling her heat and warmth and desire. He kissed her slowly, while he felt her wetness slowly surround his cock. She felt like warm oil as it dripped into her crotch and down her legs. "Do you want me?" he asked.</p> <p>She nodded emphatically. "Yes," she panted, "I want your cock."</p> <p>He positioned himself above her and pushed himself deep into her. He could see her eyes as they stared into his and a smile started creeping across her face. Her arms went around his neck.</p> <p>She wrapped them around his neck and he started thrusting into her body as she wrapped them around his waist. He saw his face disappear into her wetness and felt her tongue explore his. They both moaned into each other’s mouths. She was cumming again. She pulled his face towards her for another wild, wild kiss. For a while, she could feel her pussy clenching and loosening as pleasure coursed through her body, sending waves of pleasure through her. He could feel her lips tightening, and her throat was tight as she came again. She was so aroused that she could feel the waves of her cum rolling over her body as he plunged his cock inside her. His mouth returned to hers, as his thrusts continued.</p> <p>She could feel his balls rubbing against her, and knew that they were tightening rapidly. He didn't want to come. He wanted to prolong his orgasm long enough for her to feel him throb in her body. He pushed himself deeper into her and began to move within her, as she moaned into his mouth as his body tensed in her after the longest erotic moment of her life. "Yes…," she moaned. "Yes," she panted, "yes." His cock twitched within her and held her orgasm tightly. She could feel all of him throb in her body. The tingle began to travel all throughout her body, and she arched upwards, grinding his cock against her pussy. His cock erupted within her. He could feel his cum shooting inside her and she felt everything she needed that moment of climaxing with him: the warmth of her body, the pressure of his cock filling her, his tongue, his cock in her mouth.</p> <p>He held her in his arms as her body continued to shake throughout. He felt her body trembling before he kissed her again and they lay there, cuddling each other as his cock finally withdrew from within her. She could feel every drop of his cum within her.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>They made love like old lovers. They kissed, and they held each other. They kissed each other, and they held each other.
