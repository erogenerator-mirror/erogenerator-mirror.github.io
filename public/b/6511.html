She was lying on the bed with only her heels on and a dildo still at the other end of her dildo, and her tits and her pussy were hanging right above her face. She was sucking her dildo, and her eyes were closed, and her breathing and groans were becoming loud. I walked slowly to her side of the bed and sat down on the side, where I could see her. I looked at her and said, "I'm sorry about your earlier surprise."</p> <p>And looking down at her, she said, "How did it feel?" I looked back up at "him". "I'm sorry I didn't know you were there." And she giggled. "I just thought you would like it." "It's just that," and she looked at "and..." "and how you looked tonight." Her hand slowly reached out and touched "him". Her hands looked so familiar, and I wanted to tell her so I could hug her. "My God, what is it? What are you doing?" I said. "I'm... I haven't seen you in a while, and... and I'm just here..." and now it was getting difficult to keep conversation going. "I came back to check on them." and she opened her eyes and looked at me, "I hope you don't mind... I don't have that..." she said, and looked at her chest, then reached around to start playing with her dildo again. "Please... I've wanted this for a year..." she said at this point. I stood up as well, but stopped just out of sight. She just put the dildo back in her mouth and looked at me, eyes opened and smiling. "Really... I'm so glad I came back, so you could do this." And she lay the entire night's excitement right over to meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
