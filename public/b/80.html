I couldn't help but reach out and rub her thigh as I did so.</p> <p>"Nice," I said. "I like it."</p> <p>She continued to run her hands up and down my legs, gently and caressing me with her warm breath. She then took both her hands and gently put them under my sweater and to my bare chest. Slowly she moved them around to rest on my chest. I leaned my head up a little and kissed her lightly on the lips, slowly easing into the kiss. She then opened my shirt to expose my bare chest. She kept running her hands all over me, slowly massaging my nipples until I gently pulled away from her touch.</p> <p>She then slowly took a nipple and kissed, licking it and then sucking on it a little. She then slowly moved down my body and took off my sweater. I took off hers and we both slid my t-shirt off. She moved her hands around my body to unhook my bra. She helped me take it off, but left me wearing only a thong. I could feel wetness running down my thigh. I put my hand on her shoulder and slowly rubbed her all the way down her body.</p> <p>I put my hand on her belly, running the tips of my fingers in small circles. I could feel how hot and soft she was. She then ran her hand all the way down my abs, past my navel. She then gently ran two fingers down my thighs, running them up and down again, occasionally dipping her fingers into my wetness. She put her fingers in my pants, and I could feel her hot wetness on my fingers, making me think how wet we were.</p> <p>I then felt her slide my thong off my legs. The front of my black underwear was soaked with moisture on her hand. She slowly moved her hand up and down, feeling my moisture on her fingers. I felt her move her fingers against me and rub my clit. I could feel my legs tremble as she continued to work me at the same speed. She put in a finger inside me and slowly moved it in and out. This time I was ready, as she slowly brought out my juices. I could feel me pulsing in her hand because her finger was all the way inside of me.</p> <p>"I'm getting close," I said.</p> <p>She smiled and whispered in my ear. "It's ok. Feel good?"</p> <p>"It feels amazing," I told her.</p> <p>"I'm glad," she said. "I haven't felt like this on such a man for a long time. I can't wait any longer."</p> <p>She then kissed me softly and slowly. I could taste myself on her lips as she continued to kiss me. Then she slid her fingers inside me again, slowly making them move in and out. The feeling was incredible. I slowly started moving my hips back and forth to meet every stroke. I could feel my wetness increasing. She then broke her lips away and started kissing between my breasts and slowly working her way up to nibbling on them.</p> <p>"Oh God," I told her.</p> <p>She then took one of my nipples in her mouth and suckled it, then rolled it around in her mouth with her tongue. The feelings were incredible, and I closed my eyes to enjoy it. She then pulled me to stand before her.</p> <p>"Do I turn you on," I asked, with a sexy smile</p> <p>"Yes, it's amazing," she said with a giggle. "I've wanted to do this for a long time."</p> <p>Then she bent down and took me in her mouth for the first time. My god, it felt so good. She had one hand down, rubbing my clit with the other, just lightly brushing her fingers back and forth with each motion. I then pulled her to me. I didn't let her go as far as I want to, but I was surprised to feel her mouth. Her soft lips wrapped around me and sucked. While her hand worked me, we kissed. We played around, her fingers on my clit and sliding in and out, and up and down. Her other hand kept me hard as a rock. I pulled her away from me and kissed her again.</p> <p>"I want you with me," I whispered.</p> <p>"That sounds nice."</p> <p>We laid down on the bed and I slid down on top of her. She wrapped her arms around me and pulled me close. She then moved her hands down my chest and massaged my ass. I could feel myself getting even wetter as she made her fingers play with my sex. My head rested on her shoulder as I was feeling so good. I pulled herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
