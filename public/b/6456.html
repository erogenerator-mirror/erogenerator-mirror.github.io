I said in response to his comments.</p> <p>"Why not, you have a nice body and nice tits," Chris' response went back to his usual tone of voice, "So, do you have a big ass too?"</p> <p>I was surprised that he was being so direct and direct in the way he asked. "No," I said, "Not at all." I turned and smiled at him. He smiled back and said, with a little more forcefulness, "No, it's just I'd like to know about some really fine ass." To hear from him about so many nice ass and sexy ass... it was getting me hot. "Yeah, I was wondering if you'd like to put your ass in my lap?"</p> <p>"You are such a tease" I replied, smiling back at him. "That's what they say in that place... and I'm a tease," I told him.</p> <p>Chris leaned over and gave me a kiss. "Well, I'd love to try it, if you'd let me try."</p> <p>"I'd love to," I replied. "And I'd be thrilled!"</p> <p>We finished our coffee and walked to the mall. Each of us headed on with our thoughts and fantasies. All of this was making me wonder what is inside my panties. I decided to wear my favorite dress: the one that just barely showed off my big round ass, and was short and low coming down past my pussy. It was not going to be very flattering on my body, but it suited me. I walked into the Victoria Secret store with a big smile on my face. I picked out a few things that I would like to show off and went in a few different dresses. Then I saw the dresses I was picking out and headed into my dressing room.</p> <p>After hanging up my dress, my arms and hands were shaking. The dress was a little loose on my shoulders so I grabbed it and put it on. The dress made the bottom curve of my ass and thighs well. It did not go down past my pussy. My hands felt the dress on my breasts even though I sat down. I did not have to wear a bra to show as it did not come off. This just created a nice sexy effect when my nipples got hard as it rode against my bra. My fingers were not able to hide the fact that they were hard and I could feel me getting wet, my nipples starting to poke against the tight dress.</p> <p>I walked out of the changing area and into the women's department. Chris and I were standing in the back. I was still shaking, but I tried my best not to be as noticeable as before. He was standing behind me and his arm was on my back. I could feel his hand on my body as I walked to the dressing room. I could smell the perfume that I love. And the scent of our "love" is just as good.</p> <p>"So... what do I do in your sexy outfit?" I asked Chris, looking him deep in the eyes. He smiled and nodded his approval. We went into the private department of "our" department and looked inside to see if anything we liked was there. We couldn't find anything that looked as sexy as ours and we were all starting to get a little flushed. The girls were both looking at us, but there was a lot of attention being applied to us while us.</p> <p>"What do you think?" Chris replied, smiling at me as he pulled on the skirt. "Does it work for you?"</p> <p>"Oh my God, yes, I can't wait to try that," I replied. "I love it, do you?" I said, as the front of the skirt was showing more of my thighs.</p> <p>Chris nodded his acknowledgement while he pulled on the top. "Perfect! How did you do?"</p> <p>"I really like it," I replied, as we walked in to the clothing department. It was kind of a "sleeveless fit" sort of store. The front of the dress was not as tight, but rather the sides had a low, slant strap across them which kept it in the right place. It was sort of a halter with small triangular pieces on the top. The fabric just barely materialized my breasts and they could be seen by the sides of my breasts.</p> <p>We were in the right place, as the dressing room was closed off. With my dress being a halter top, it did not have much of a support in the front. When we were in there, it was not being pulled up, rather the dress was pulled up and over, in such a way that it was just covering the top of my breasts, which were still covered when I was standing. Chris then slid his hands up to my waist. The top was pretty tight so he had to pull the dress upâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
