Do you realize, you're still the guy I was with when you fucked his mom? I couldn't have handled that either."</p> <p>"No, I'm not that big. When was the last time you got your meat inside it?"</p> <p>"You mean the last time, that's my story."</p> <p>"Then what was the last night or so, that we both had a little time?" "You have no idea, I came like a freight train."</p> <p>"That wasn't quite what all those people said."</p> <p>"Yes ma'am. The last person I would have wanted to talk to. I didn't want to scare the neighbors by letting them know where they could look and see what happened here."</p> <p>"You and I both know better, don't you? I thought the last of us was a friend of mine and I should be with the guy that hurt you and put him out of his misery."</p> <p>"It wasn't an accident, honey. It was the thing that broke me."</p> <p>"You want a divorce?"</p> <p>"Of course. Why else could you have been with my son?"</p> <p>"I guess the same goes for you too. You can be with him anytime and anywhere you want as long as you leave the kids and move back home."</p> <p>"You mean your son is going to be your lover whenever you want him."</p> <p>"Honey, I don't want a divorce. I just thought we should talk a little more about what happened with the baby. I'm sure you'll agree that I didn't come into these woods in a robe and go home with that damn thing in my mouth."</p> <p>"Yes ma'am, I was sorry but I was too late. And I know you'll forgive me."</p> <p>"I don't think you're so far gone that you're not going to understand where I am or why I came to this conclusion earlier."</p> <p>"But I do, when can I expect you out of my life, I don't need your wife to walk down the aisle, now do I?"</p> <p>"Yes I do, but I'm not your wife. I never said I was with my son or that the kids were yours. I thought I'd come out here and marry you to pay the price."</p> <p>He kissed her cheek and put his foot on the bench behind his chair.</p> <p>"I think it's too late. I'm already in love with you and I'm going to marry you and put you out of your misery."</p> <p>"That's it, we're just talking about love."</p> <p>"Maybe. But before you say anything else, tell the kids to get dressed and come downstairs."</p> <p>*</p> <p>The next day there wasn't much in the store but they bought a case of beer and sat around talking for a while. He even left his house and went on a trip home with the kids.</p> <p>"That's all you need to know, they've moved to the suburbs. The boys'll have their old boat in the morning."</p> <p>"Are they playing in the woods? Or perhaps playing a picnic?"</p> <p>"As they're starting to come home anyway, they won't be able to swim. You're both welcome in my home anytime, anytime. But it won't be like you're going to take the kids, will it?"</p> <p>"I'm thinking that maybe with the kids' parents over, you could come to visit us at our home after school is over and stay if you want. I would also like you to call the girls as often as you can. The kids will be very happy in their own way."</p> <p>He smiled at her enthusiasm. "Is your son in love with me or would it be easier to ask before you talk." "Ask me what? Ask me about my son, my husband, my children."</p> <p>"I'm not going to ask you about your son. But you're going to be in love with him." "Maybe with my own son, but in love with my son."</p> <p>"Does my husband know that you're in love with him?"</p> <p>"No, not that he doesn't know, but he knows that I might want to be with him in a different way."</p> <p>"Why can't we talk about this with your son?"</p> <p>"It's the other night and now I've had enough."</p> <p>"What can I do to make amends?" "There is the usual thing. I'll be in town when we call for the kids the next day. I'll still be here when they get home and can see them."</p> <p>"Maybe you can doâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
