When she bent over and picked something up, she looked over and said, "There's something for you to get out."</p> <p>The young man looked at the ring for a moment and then said, "I wonder if I need money now."</p> <p>"Oh," she said, "how many other things do you have?"</p> <p>He took out a stack of dollars but he didn't move.</p> <p>"Okay." He hesitated, "here, go ahead."</p> <p>"No," she said, "You're going to have to have the other things. Go ahead. All of them."</p> <p>He looked at her, "Are you sure you want to do this?"</p> <p>"Come over here," she said, turning around to face away from him.</p> <p>He walked over and sat down in front of her and pulled up about a foot apart so she could lean against the table, "Okay."</p> <p>She looked at him as she held the box out to him.</p> <p>"I can't," he said, "but it'll be more than you know."</p> <p>"What?" she said, "This is going to feel so, so good."</p> <p>He gave her a long kiss. He was the first guy she's ever been with. It was more than she expected to be having, but she didn't want to hurt him in any way.</p> <p>As the kissing went on, they began to make out, feeling each others' hands begin to roam over their bodies. She was wearing a bra while he had on a pair of jeans and, of course, had a bra on underneath it all. In her mind, she was picturing herself naked in just a pair. The kisses became more and more sexual as they both began to strip. Before long, they were naked and he laid down against the table, kissing down her stomach again as she pulled her panties down and off. He stopped there, taking off his shirt, before she could take off hers, and she did. Soon, she stood, holding his cock in her hands.</p> <p>"I think you're ready for something a little more adventurous. Maybe we can do it a little differently. Here, pull your skirt off for me."</p> <p>She had gotten the skirt off of her body earlier, but when he said something she could see it laying on the table. She had already stripped down to just her panties. She had never done anything like this before. It wasn't very comfortable. It took some time to get it off and she was pretty nervous. She grabbed his cock and, as she held it, she reached for the box again, but he stopped her.</p> <p>"Do as you're told," he said. "Let me help."</p> <p>She reached down and lifted the front up and, with an expert hands, he was pulling her panties off and, in this case, off of her, which she wasn't too sure she would.</p> <p>She felt a chill running up the inside of her, but he just smiled. She wondered if that's why. It wasn't that she was scared for she was as excited as she was. He had asked her if she enjoyed it, and she had been sure that she had, but she just didn't know what to think, even if it made her feel good to do it on a stage.</p> <p>All the nerves in the world were rushing from her mind, and not much longer. This wasn't just a stage. It was being a woman being touched by a man. She wanted so badly to be able to say that the sex itself wasn't that mind-blowing and, if the man really wanted to cum on her, it was okay. He had made it that far that she hadn't really thought it possible to cum. She still had been unsure of herself and not quite sure of herself, but this all felt so exciting she didn't care if it was over when he was kissing her all over. Maybe she should just try it. The more she thought of it in the mirror, the more she began to think perhaps she should. As his hands were moving around her waist, slowly, she wanted to get him to touch her. She started to get a little worried. She hadn't cum that hard or that fast. She hadn't even been touched like that in her whole life. This seemed awfully strange, especially after what he just asked her to do. And though he was the man of the show and the whole situation was strange, it seemed so right. Maybe it was okay to be the center of attention, but now it was more than OK. She had always been attracted to men, particularly men who went through puberty and were never completely satisfied until she came to live in a different world.</p> <p>She didn't know what to think. She felt nervous but this whole moment was going to feel really good.
