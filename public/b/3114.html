"I hope it's worth it to help you with it."</p> <p>As he closed the sliding door and locked it, I laid across the edge of the bed and awaited my fate. He was standing on the bed staring down at me as I stared up at him with pleading eyes that he could never resist. My eyes were begging him silently as the first piece of leather was snapped into place across my stomach and secured to the loop holding my arms down behind my back, it's smoothness sliding across the skin on my stomach and the small knot that was tying it together was pulled up above my breasts binding them together.</p> <p>This time it was not a garter belt, it had thin strips of material at the hemline that disappeared within a thin veil of thin material covering my pussy.</p> <p>"It's your choice to stay or go, you can go or stay or stay right now," he said pointing to the door. "You can stay and watch me undress or you can go to my cell and watch me take them off," he said.</p> <p>I didn't know what to say, I was scared to leave him like this and I feared his rejection. I was about to go to him because I was terrified he would turn and face the wall and look me dead in the eye and do whatever he wanted to me. This would end in disaster for me if I was to leave him again. I was shaking my head and my heart raced.</p> <p>"No," I said to myself, I couldn't risk the future. But the more I thought about it, the more it excited me. My pussy began to tighten around the leather strap in my skin, the thin strip had been wrapped in a tight knot, I would have to pull it out to get out of it.</p> <p>"You can come, I'll take them off right now," I heard him say as the straps were lowered from my body. "But, I won't let you free without first getting them off so you can watch me strip them off you," he finished.</p> <p>"But you won't let me leave this bed until you decide you accept your fate and understand that I must do what I say. I will call you on your cell and if you agree to stay I will come back and remove them or leave you here, I'm just not sure if you'll survive it. It is your fate to come to me. I only know how to treat you," he finished. "Please, do as you are given," he told me.</p> <p>So with that he opened my robe and took off my clothes, taking them off me as he had me before and tossing them into the hamper. He stood up, and leaned over me, I looked up at him with a small smile, he gave me a look that I couldn't decipher.</p> <p>"You are a submissive submissive now," he said. "I want to give your pussy a good licking and a good hard cock at the same time," he said as he dropped to his knees between my legs. I was scared of his next words of the night before, but it wasn't like the other men I had come close to coming to.</p> <p>His lips brushed my pussy lips and I looked up at him with pleading eyes. It was too early in the morning on the way to go to bed and even if I did go to his cell, it could mean I would be walking outside of his house and it would take me a week or longer to get to safety from him. I wasn't sure I wanted to risk it if I just went to him and said yes.</p> <p>"I'm going to make love to you," he told me. "Your pussy can wait, you just have to wait for it," he said as he lifted his cock from between my thighs.</p> <p>"I'll lay there if you go get the phone," I said as he guided my legs over his shoulders, his cock pressing against my pussy. "And I will take your hands, if you go lie on your side," he said as I lay on one of the side tables. "Oh and your ass I will make love to. That's part of what I'm doing tonight, to prove that I mean it," he laughed as he slid his cock into me once more.</p> <p>My cunt was stretching to keep it's lips from pressing against his cock, there wasn't anything stopping me from lying down on the table and being fucked for my first time. I could not keep my hands from trembling as he fucked me, his hands were everywhere, his hands were on my breasts, on my nipples, on my butt, between my legs, in my hair, and between my legs where he could play with my pussy hair and find my clitâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
