She flicked it against her cheek and held her head in place so they could both see him. Her hand cupped his balls, which twitched at the contact, as if to draw his pleasure from her hand. She slid the silk from her hands and ran the rough material along her fingers as she lowered her lips to cover his hard cock. She teased him as her head moved back to stare at her prize, as if to tell him where to go next. Her hand slipped off and he saw the cruel smile on her face. She slowly lowered her lips, teasing him with the feel of her breath as he felt how warm and wet the silk was against his cock. He watched her as she ran her lips back down him again, then back up, her tongue flickering along his skin. Just when he thought she was going to take him into her, she slid her lips back down his length, sucking lightly on him with her tongue.</p> <p>She slid the leather straps gently off her shoulders, watching him as her hands came down to pull them down her arms. He looked up at her with his eyes pleading with her to do what needed to be done. His hand ran down her body until he cupped her ass in his palm, teasing with his fingers. His finger pushed into her ass, as her hand slowly and steadily stroked him while she sucked him.</p> <p>He moved closer to her, strumming her hair with his fingers as he kneaded her ass, bringing his other hand down over her backside, making her moan lightly. His hand moved over her, sliding over her body to her nipples as their lips found each and every inch of flesh together. Their fingers caressed with an intensity they craved. Both of them were gasping as their fingers met once again. Her hips rocked on his fingers, her body begging for them to play in her. Her head rolled back in pleasure, her breasts heaving under the slightest movement. Her hand slowed as she saw him move his other hand to cup her breast. She sucked him again, wanting his finger, needing it to move in and out of her. He watched her as she licked her lips, then down her chin, tasting him as he ran his finger over her nipple. She arched her back, her eyes watching him as she licked his lips, tasting herself. She knew what was next.</p> <p>One hand found its way to one of her breasts, teasing her until she arched against him with the need for more. His finger found her slit and slid between her lips, parting them to bring him closer to her. He teased one nipple harder than the other by running his finger from her clit to her pussy. The tips lightly brushed her lips as his finger found her spot, her body was bucking against him. Just when he thought she was going to cum, she slipped his finger into her, her hips jutting off him. She felt him swell within her as he held her against him.</p> <p>He felt the muscles in her body tighten as he felt her wetness on his hand. He knew she had almost forgotten what they had been doing before, but he still wanted her so he continued. His finger slid from her sopping pussy to slowly press against her asshole. The head of his cock slid easily into her as her body tensed against him. He held her hips and eased himself farther into her. He could already feel that hot pussy clinging to him tightly as she felt his length slowly take her. He groaned softly as he began slowly to stroke into her. Her hands tangled in the hair at the back of his neck and she pressed her hips against him with her own. He felt so tight and so good as he stroked deeper into her. The feeling of her tightness around him overwhelmed him. He felt her juices run down her leg as he stroked and felt her pussy grip his cock hard as she orgasmed on his hand.</p> <p>Just when he thought she was ready to cum, she released her leg from his neck and wrapped her arms around his neck. She pulled him forward against her, meeting him with a passionate kiss. He could feel her body tightening against him. The hot breath against his lips. She could feel him deep inside her, with her legs wrapped around his waist. He could feel her body trembling against his. Her mouth kissed his neck when she felt him come inside her. As he watched her she let one leg slide from his and turn over again. When she had her back to him, he slid out from her and took off his jacket and threw it to the floor. The leather of his uniform slid off his shoulders but it didn't do anything. It turned him on.</p> <p>He took his gloves off as he knelt before her.
