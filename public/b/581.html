You wouldn’t believe how long it took,” she answered.</p> <p>“Oh, it felt weird sitting down in the pool with you.”</p> <p>“You didn’t, either. Besides, I was on the verge of doing something about my jeans,” she said. “So, you’re going to have to help too, huh?”</p> <p>“Yep.” I walked towards her, stopping only long enough to wrap my hands around hers and rub their smooth skin.</p> <p>“Mmm, that feels soo good. Do you do that all the time,” she asked, smiling.</p> <p>“Yeah, I try to, but it can be pretty difficult.” I replied.</p> <p>“Do you do that more, sometimes?” she asked as she squashed her hand over mine.</p> <p>“Sometimes. You know, once in a while?” I asked.</p> <p>“Wow, that feels really good. If you want, you can tell me to go to the bathroom and I’ll do it. I’ll do it when you are sitting right there.” I told her as she got up to follow me.</p> <p>I watched her ass as she moved away with her shorts and panties. Her ass looked so full and sexy. I could swear that I felt my cock start to stir again, thinking about how much I would like to see it again.</p> <p>When we got to the water closet door, I could see that it was unlocked. She looked at me and put my cock back in my pants.</p> <p>“Do you think you could help me undress or something? I want to show you off for all to see.” She asked as she came towards me.</p> <p>“Sure. Why not. Come over.”</p> <p>We started undressing each other slowly as I sat on a bench outside the pool and watched.</p> <p>“Wow, you seem to be hard. Do you always have that effect on me?” She asked. “I want you, I want to make love to you.”</p> <p>“Honey, don’t you think that the more I make you look at, the less you will want me?” I answered. It was my turn to smile at her as she undid her shorts. Her shorts dropped to the ground as mine were all that I wore.</p> <p>“That’s not what I meant at all. I,” she said, shaking me. I stood and she stepped over my body until she was standing on the end of the bench. She then sat on my lap facing me. My shaft slid between her legs and I could feel her heat with it as she hugged my neck.</p> <p>”Wow, what am I doing?” she said as she leaned her head to my ear. She ran her hands over my chest and slid her hand down and inside my shorts. I was already hard again and I didn’t seem to have much restraint left or to stop her. She rubbed her hand over my cock until it became erect and then she sat back again.</p> <p>“Can’t you do something to help?” she asked.</p> <p>“Well... what ever I can,” I answered as I began to rub her thighs.</p> <p>“Mmmm, that feels so good. I don’t know why women are so interested in men so much.” she said as she slid a couple fingers inside me.</p> <p>“Well, don’t worry. I’ll make sure it never gets too rough.” I assured her. She then let go of me and I looked at her face. She was smiling at me and her eyes looked hungry.</p> <p>“You know, I don’t think I ever expected this as much as you.”</p> <p>“I didn’t, either. I guess I had a lot of questions in here,” I answered honestly. "Maybe we should do this another time, if you really want to.”</p> <p>“Oh, you’re always going to get a little rough?” she replied. “Not that I mind,” she continued.</p> <p>“Oh, I’m serious about that. I always love your style of foreplay,” I said as I looked at her face—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
