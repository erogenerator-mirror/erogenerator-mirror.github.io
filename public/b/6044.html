I knocked on the door and waited anxiously for an answer. When Mr. S opened the door, he said, "It's time you came home...you want to come in?" At that, I began to tremble and I was afraid I would do something stupid or not. Mr. S then escorted me to the hallway where I stepped between two large doors on my side, to the left.</p> <p>I was led through the hallway by Mr. S to a door to which I could not unlock, and which was also large enough to fit into. I entered a large room, which at the end was almost a large bathroom, where a shower was filling the room with steam, and other sounds of water being splashed on the tiled walls. The door to the bathroom closed and left me standing alone there.</p> <p>The walls of the small room were thick and covered with ragged, loose, gray carpeting. There were also two doors to the right that led to a bedroom with a double bed, a dresser, and a few other rooms like it. I couldn't take my eyes off of the ceiling. There were two small white, leather, couches on either side of the room, each with some sort of metal contraption in it, and the room smelled of leather. Several other rooms had leather, leather, leather, and leather couches at each end as well. The only other door between two rooms, however, was the door that lead to our bedroom.</p> <p>There were also two doors on the opposite side of the room, leading to the bathroom, where a shower could be located. I noticed, however, that I could not see the shower or anything about it, which might not be a good place to get ready to leave to leave a message. I decided to leave this room for a while and go back to mine with a better idea.</p> <p>I sat down on the other couch and looked at my phone. I texted: 'Hello...'</p> <p>'Hello...' I replied. I started typing on my phone and took a moment to glance around the room. I recognized as all the places in the world, and some of the things I had seen, heard, and photographed, were all ones I might remember. I had not yet learned my own name, but I already knew who I was, so I figured that I could at least keep the conversations going. And, it only took a few minutes for one person to get involved.</p> <p>My phone rang. It was Mr. S.</p> <p>"Hello? Hello... how was your flight?" "Not bad, Mr. S," I replied to Mr. S. without taking my eyes off of the phone.</p> <p>"Mr. S.... I have a... a meeting with a client today, and if you want to come...."</p> <p>"Mr. S..... you know you have to......"</p> <p>"I know that Mr. S.", I interrupted him, "but I do want to...."</p> <p>"I understand. I will call you when I need you. Goodbye, Mr. S. Please hang up this phone."</p> <p>'The rest of the day went very uneventful for me. I slept well and took nice and long showers to get a feel for the hotel I was staying in," I thought to myself, as I walked down the hall as Mr. S called me.</p> <p>I got back to my room and started to unpack my bag for the long conference I was going to be on. I wanted to get ready and get my hair and nails done while I was there. I decided that I didn't want to spend so much time on putting on lingerie, so I started getting everything ready. I even did a lot of putting on makeup. I felt sexy as hell, but it had really been a while. I finished up and I found my outfit and put it on, but didn't do much of anything. I went downstairs to the living room and waited. I didn't see a clock over the fireplace, so I took my time to look around the room.</p> <p>"Damn...." I mused to myself, as I sat next to Mr. S and started playing with him. "My life just got such a turn around today..."</p> <p>"Mr. S..." I began, "what is going on in here? Are you going to be late and not come in?"</p> <p>"My meeting went very well. Maybe you could stay a little while, Mr. S... I don't mind staying a little while in the office tonight anyway."</p> <p>I had never heard Mr. S use that particular word before or at all. I thought 'What in the world is he doing just talking to himself? I wasn't in the mood for him to get onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
