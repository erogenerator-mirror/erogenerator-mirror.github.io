Have her suck all my cum out of my ass. Or, you could suck the rest of it out into her mouth. Either option would be great for that purpose. She wouldn’t even feel left out, would she?”</p> <p>I didn’t answer at all, I knew the answer, yet, so I didn’t. Maybe I should. But the woman would be watching anyway, so I could just watch from afar, and she would not have to be in the house.</p> <p>“She certainly wouldn’t like that,” he said. “But I think she will soon get over that hurdle.”</p> <p>“Would you do this for her?” I asked</p> <p>“She would do this for you,” He answered, not sounding too confident, too sure.</p> <p>“Is that right?”</p> <p>“Yes,” He answered. “You better.”</p> <p>I started to take off my shirt, but he stopped me.</p> <p>“No, you stay in that place you went.”</p> <p>I looked up as I took off my shirt and he smiled.</p> <p>“I know what you mean.”</p> <p>I sat down on the floor next to him. He pulled off his pants right on front of me, and reached out to stroke my face. Without looking, I reached out and touched the head of my cock, and he took it in his hand and licked the tip.</p> <p>“Oh,” I moaned, and that sounded so sexy. He looked up at me, and I leaned forward, and kissed him, pressing my tongue into his mouth, his tongue. We sucked, and he made me kiss his neck, and chest, and finally, my lower lips started to caress the underside of his penis, my tongue sliding around the head and tickling the surface, before my tongue licked around his tip. His hands caressed my face, and he groaned and pressed against me, putting his hand behind my head and holding me in place. I took his cock in my hand, and I looked up at him, wanting to taste his taste again, as my tongue did a tongue twist, and that sent some of his cum to my face. I kissed him again, and I could feel his hand move down to my balls, and I started to jerk him off, as I kissed him and worked my tongue around for a few minutes. I felt his hand in my hair, and his hips moving up and down, trying his best. I smiled, and felt my balls tightening up, so I stopped.</p> <p>“I’m going to come very soon,” I said. “It will be my turn, and I am going to show you my pussy,” I got off the floor again, and stood in front of him. I was only in my underwear, the top covering my cock, but that made up for it, as in his words, I needed to be hard very hard.</p> <p>“That’s a nice cock,” I said, smiling.</p> <p>I walked to him, and he took it in his hands, and it swayed and swayed with each step. I rubbed the top of it against my face, my nose and lips making squelchings of his flesh and sweat. I let the tip slide into my mouth, and let the shaft graze my tongue. I closed my lips. He closed his eyes.</p> <p>“God, you are such a good little slut,” I said with a smile. It was good that I was a good little slut, because a lot of people would never have known me. The power of the man was over me. In front of a room full of women and men, he was a slave, and there was little if any doubt that I could fuck him the way he wanted.</p> <p>I took my mouth off, letting him touch the head again. He looked back and laughed, but continued. I took his cock in my hand and started to jack him off.</p> <p>“Fuck, you are good,” he said.</p> <p>“Are you going to come for me, or for me, too,” I asked, grinning.</p> <p>“Oh, do me,” He said, taking my cock out of my grip. He put one hand on my shoulder and guided me back toward the edge of the couch. I took his cock in my other hand, and put it in my mouth. It tasted different, and tasted of more of an olive salt, slightly tangy and salty, and he knew I liked—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
