He heard her turn the key, and knew that she was in a room. He followed her in behind her as she walked back up into a bedroom. She turned, and smiled.</p> <p>"Oh, my god. I haven't felt this kind of excitement in years."</p> <p>"You have no idea," he said in a husky voice while he held her close. "When you get dressed, you can't stop thinking about me. Maybe you don't even know what an 'in time' is."</p> <p>"That's just it," she said, "the past is past, and you never know when that might happen."</p> <p>He didn't know what this night meant for them – he still loved her, but he didn't hate her because he had feelings for her, either. He just enjoyed being with her, she was fun to be with, and so much fun to be with.</p> <p>"I guess we should get ready before we go."</p> <p>"We should go," she said, and kissed him lightly on the cheek. "This is your first time for sex, you have to be prepared."</p> <p>"Do we have the nerve to make passionate love in your room?"</p> <p>Karyn looked down for a second; both her legs were soaked through already. She had forgotten how tight her shorts were, and could imagine them getting wetter all the time. This was what she needed.</p> <p>"Oh yeah, I've really got that thought in my head every night."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Yeah, really much of it."</p> <p>"Good. Let's go!" he said, and pulled her to him.</p> <p>Laughing softly, Lola pushed him over the edge. She was so wet and excited, it was easy for it to happen. She couldn't believe everything that had happened in her younger years, especially that she had felt things. She let out a sigh when he entered her first. It hurt, it was so sudden, but she felt so much in love with him. She had wanted to make love with him since she was a little girl, and he had filled her up, and she loved it.</p> <p>It was perfect, they both needed it. He looked down at her and kissed her. "I need to fuck you again, Lola."</p> <p>"Do it," she insisted, taking his hand as they climbed the stairs to her room.</p> <p>"You have such lovely skin," he said. "And such beautiful eyes."</p> <p>She just smiled. Her nipples were hard, and were barely visible beneath her shirt as she sat on the bed. He undressed quickly, and they embraced once more, kissing, sucking. It wasn't about him; they both wanted it. This time was really going to be different than before, it was going to be different. She loved the way he looked after all this time, and had longed to finally taste him.</p> <p>"You ready?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>He sat her on the bed, kissing the soft skin with his lips. He licked them, before moving down to the top of her breasts, his tongue tasting the nipples, his lips wet, his breath warm on them. Lola let out a soft moan.</p> <p>"Fuck me, fuck me now!" she begged, holding his head as his tongue swirled around the swollen nubs of her areola.</p> <p>He did, immediately, and began to rock back and forth, driving her mad with the feelings of his touch. Lola felt her orgasm building quickly, as he drove her over the edge with his body. With a cry of pleasure, she arched her back and came hard, not caring that she still had no intention of fucking him tonight. Just knowing that she had pleased him, made her feel so much better, and she loved the fact that she had pleased him.</p> <p>"Damn, that was great!" he said, with a sigh as he climbed off of the bed and stood up. She got up and followed him, looking around the room for a moment, before she grabbed him and hugged him.</p> <p>"Did you have a good time?" she asked, as she pulled him toward the bed.</p> <p>"Oh yeah, great."</p> <p>"I could tell," she said, feeling very happy herself with his response.</p> <p>"But I wanted to take you home before we went all the way," he said.</p> <p>There was a look of disappointment on her face. "That's too early."</p> <p>"Well," he said, "Let's see how long it takes, we have time before you need to be back to school."</p> <p>He pulled her up to the bed, and they laid next to each other.
