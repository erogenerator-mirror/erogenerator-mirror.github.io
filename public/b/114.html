"So sweet, you can tell me anything I want to know. I want that. Tell me, please," he said, his whole body suddenly going rigid.</p> <p>"No," she said quickly. "Don't..."</p> <p>But he didn't stop. He kissed her more deeply and passionately, feeling the wetness and heat of her on his tongue. She opened her thighs for him again, and he pressed his body against hers.</p> <p>"I want this," he whispered.</p> <p>She smiled. "Good. I am so wet it's going to take me weeks to get myself off again, honey."</p> <p>"I know," he said as he pushed himself into her again. "I'm going to tell you what I got me," he told her. "A hundred times I did the same thing to you last night."</p> <p>"No," she whimpered, wrapping her legs behind him and pulling him into her. "Keep going. Don't stop. I want you to stay hard."</p> <p>"Good," he said. "Because that's exactly what I want to do."</p> <p>He smiled. "This is why I need your patience." She closed her legs about him and held him at the edge. She wrapped her arms around him and pulled him into her again, pressing him against her. Her own pussy squeezed his hardness, and he felt his cock stiffen even more in response. They moaned together and began to move in and out. He cupped her breasts, feeling her nipple tighten between his fingers.</p> <p>"Oh God," she moaned. "Fuck me, please!"</p> <p>"You're so wet," he moaned.</p> <p>She bit her lip and squeezed his cock, which by now was rock-hard and throbbing. He pulled himself out and pushed himself back into her. She gripped him hard as she continued to moan.</p> <p>"Come on, baby," he groaned. "It's been almost a year or more."</p> <p>Her thighs clamped around him and her nails dug into his skin.</p> <p>"I can't," she groaned. "I'm a married woman. I can't have sex again."</p> <p>"I know," he said. "Don't worry, I'm on the pill. I don't go through the whole pregnancy thing," he said as he thrust himself inside her. "Just as long as I have you."</p> <p>"No," she said and squeezed him even harder. "You can't. I should have waited until you got rid of the pills."</p> <p>He grinned. "You had a lot to drink down there, baby. I don't want to wait."</p> <p>"I wish I could say what I wanted to say," she said, and held onto him. "You make it so hard on the body, you make me so horny... and yes, it's going to happen."</p> <p>His dick pulsed, and then felt like it was going to burst. He didn't want it to, not with her. He needed to just take it. He wanted to take her right there. She had promised herself in the heat of the moment that this weekend would be her reward.</p> <p>He kept his body in tune with her, and her hips responded by going crazy in response. She kept pulling his arms as he worked himself inside her, and he could feel himself getting ready to burst. But he wanted more, needed more.</p> <p>"Please... fuck me."</p> <p>"Fuck me all over," he said and grinned. "Just let me do that."</p> <p>"God, you are driving me wild," she purred as they made love again.</p> <p>"Yes, we should do it now," he said, and she smiled and looked up at him. "But I got something I had to do first."</p> <p>He pulled himself off and slid onto his back. "Do you want to do this?" he said as he beckoned her downward. He could hear her breathing through her mouth. "I know it's crazy, but, okay... if you would."</p> <p>He smiled and guided her slowly onto her hands and knees. He pushed himself upwards so that she was facing him. She looked so beautiful, her eyes closed, and her face slightly flushed. He took this as a hint to enter her, and she smiled and opened her eyes.</p> <p>"Do me like you do her," he said. "I want you to feel like you belong to me."</p> <p>He reached down and pulled her hips up and drove himself into her again and again, and she moaned. Her eyes were glazed, and he felt her body tighten around him one last time. Then he stopped and she pushed herself back down until her hips met his. He smiled at her as he leaned forward and sucked her tongue, still wet from her before.
