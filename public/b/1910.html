When I was about 14, my parents had decided we each had to do something to pass the time. I guess I figured if I got out of it, maybe I'd do it again sometime, and if anything else happened, he'd be out with friends and my dad's wife had come home and found all kind of crazy. So one night I got out of my high school and I was in high school, still a virgin, I never played much girl. After a time I started talking to my cousins, and I learned how to read, how to talk, learn language, and the like."</p> <p>"So what happened? I mean how did you go from being a virgin to having a boyfriend and then living with a guy to actually having sex?"</p> <p>"Well, I went to a local sex shop, bought some things online. I found you that I hadn't seen you before, I was going to buy some things but decided if you had a girl for a boyfriend I'd be in your way."</p> <p>"I'm scared."</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Do you still love him?"</p> <p>"Yes, but it's not the same thing. I think I'm falling in love with you. I never want you to be upset with me but I do love you."</p> <p>"But we might want to find ways to get together?"</p> <p>"Oh yes, but it would be like a secret. I don't want you to find out. Do you still love me?"</p> <p>"I do love you. I do not know why we want to be together. I love you and I do not want you to think I am a lecherous old perv in your youth or anything like that."</p> <p>"You're wrong, you're right, I do care about you. I don't want you to think I'm a bad person or that's okay. I just don't want you to think I'm an old perv." We laughed.</p> <p>"Well, we can do it, if you want."</p> <p>We held hands, we got up, I put my boxers on and she put on her robe. I watched her as she went down to the water. We dried off and she put on her robe. We went back into the living room.</p> <p>"I've got some food in the kitchen. I'd like you to make me a cup of coffee."</p> <p>We got a pot of coffee out from the fridge and carried it for her. He sat down opposite us, and I was eating my breakfast. She left the door open.</p> <p>After an hour we were both exhausted and went to bed. She fell asleep right next to me. I fell asleep and woke up later, my arms around her. She was naked, sitting in a chair and she was sleeping in my lap. I couldn't resist.</p> <p>We got up to go take a shower. She was the perfect hostess.</p> <p>We got into the shower together. I got the soap and started to lather her up good with my soapy hands. I put my cock into her and she was instantly ready to get the evening started.</p> <p>We dried each other off. I took the soap and washed her face. Then I put my cock in her as I soaped up her breasts. I worked my erection slowly as I washed her body.</p> <p>We finished up and went to get a bed and get comfortable. She was a little sore as I was soaping her up. I felt like I'd just done everything possible. We kissed as I licked her nipples. Then we got our clothes off.</p> <p>She was just as ready to go as I was. We got out of the shower and dried and went into the bedroom.</p> <p>We stripped out of the rest, laid out, and got into bed. I felt her tits as they bounced as we moved against each other. I was getting myself in to bed, she was there and there is could be no more.</p> <p>But there was too. After about 10 minutes of kissing between us, I had been so turned on I couldn't take anymore. I told her how much I loved her and wanted to have sex with her again. We spent about half an hour kissing like lovers making love. It was so sensual and tender.</p> <p>Then, like everything else, I rolled her on her side and she moved so her bottom was slightly higher, in my lap, in our bed, and I could see that she was very turned on. I kissed her, then took my shaft in my hand and put it at her entrance. She was wet already. I slowly pushed the head inside her and it slid into her like a glove.</p> <p>"I can't believe how big you are." She said.</p> <p>"As big as your father's."
