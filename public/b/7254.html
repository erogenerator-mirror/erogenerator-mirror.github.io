I'm sorry I've been such a bitch." I looked at her, my eyes darting back and forth as I looked at her ass, which she was pointing up at me as she leaned forward toward me. I grabbed her hand and pulled her body up by the hips toward me.</p> <p>She got up and I saw that the top of her thong was completely down around her ankles as she stood. I pulled her to me and I leaned forward, kissing her. She responded and I moved my hands to her ass to pull the fabric of the thong to each side. She wiggled it out and then moved to me to pull my shirt over my head. I held her ass through the fabric, sliding my hands over both cheeks, feeling the heat of them. Her tongue darted in and out of my mouth as my arms moved across her. She began grinding her pelvis against mine and I could feel the silkiness of her thong pressing against my skin as she moved against it. Suddenly her hands left and she stepped back, her body in her panties and shirt. She smiled at me, grabbed my shirt and pulled it over me.</p> <p>"Let me get these out." she said, grabbing my shirt and throwing it on the floor and moving toward me.</p> <p>She reached for her bag hanging on the hook, took one of mine and pulled it out. As she pulled the door back around the front I grabbed it and started to get to my feet. When she saw my feet move toward her, she leaned in to kiss me again.</p> <p>"Let me show you something," she said as she lifted herself off of me and started to leave the room.</p> <p>I closed the door and pulled up my sweat pants and slid my thong down from around my cock and around my ass.</p> <p>"There's enough room for that," she smiled and then ran over to the bathroom.</p> <p>I looked to see her walk back over to the closet and then run back toward me with her bag laying on the floor. She turned to me, her arms about a dozen of inches from my face, one in each hand. She smiled when she looked down at my face.</p> <p>"Oh, I forgot about that," she said.</p> <p>I pulled my shirt back over my head and stood up and then I took her hand and pulled her down to me. She came up on her toes and kissed me and then stood upright and ran her hands back down my body. As she reached my belt she pulled it through the loops. I pulled it over my head and it fell to the floor as she dropped to her knees and took my cock in her hands. She slowly stroked my shaft as I stepped to her and took in each inch of her naked body as she kissed and licks the head of my cock. She stopped briefly to look up at me as she licked the rim of the mushroom tip then moved her lips around it, licking up and down the shaft. I moved on her, running my wet index finger over the outer lip of her cunt, up to the hooded nubbin of her clitoris and then back down the center to her opening, which was still slick from her flowing juices.</p> <p>She spread her knees wider and I slid my fingers into her opening and felt her start to open as my index finger slid in and began to slide her toward my wrist. She moaned as my digit slid in and out of her entrance and slowly pushed deeper inside of her. She closed her eyes and opened her legs and looked up at me as she began moving up and down on my hand.</p> <p>"I want you to fuck me," she blurted out.</p> <p>"I love fucking you," I replied.</p> <p>"Now, you better hurry," she said sternly to me as she dropped herself again onto her knees.</p> <p>I leaned back slightly so that she could take my cock into her mouth and she opened as widely as she could without losing the head of my shaft. She wrapped her lips around it and slid down to press the base of my cock against her throat. I felt the warmth of her tongue as it slid against the underside of the crown. As she slid down the shaft, I felt my fingers spreading her lips and sliding into her depths. I pushed all the way into her as I felt her lips slide further and further back on my cock. Her tongue was now flicking at the rim of my cock as it slid up and down her slit.</p> <p>I reached my hand down for my cock, pushing it to enter her with one hand, but not fast enough. The feeling of my hand on my cock was so sensuous that I slid it out of her. As soon as I did, I found a trail of her honeyed juices from her clit to her opening that made them so moist.</p> <p>As she pulled back she reached downâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
