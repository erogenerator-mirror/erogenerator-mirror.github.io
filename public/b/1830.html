"This is between your wife and me. Go to a bar, make a scene and leave a note with your name to be sure you're not having a drinking problem."</p> <p>At this point she noticed that the bartender had already made himself comfortable in the booth. She smiled at the sight of it - his wife was sitting across from him with a bottle of champagne in her hand. She looked over at Sarah and smiled with those beautiful dimples showing on her lips. The sight of her legs crossed as she leaned against the bar added to the effect. She looked over at Josh's wife - she was watching him and she looked back at the bar as if nothing had happened.</p> <p>He looked back at her and nodded his head for her to continue. He was getting pretty worked up over this.</p> <p>"Ok, so this is how it goes. One of your friends goes to a bar, you sit for a while, and then meet another friend... You sit. The bartender will order a free drink -- or a rum and cayenne. Once he starts talking on the phone, you say 'hello'. He starts walking around... you get up, walk into an ally, and sit facing the wall. The bartender puts down his drink and walks back to you and the bartender -- you sit... he orders another drink, and begins talking. He asks how you like wine, what you like to drink. He asks if you like to be sexy and you answer, yes. He then asks if you want to be naughty - but you answer 'yes'. The bartender then picks up a cigarette from the table and puts a fresh one on the tip of you. He asks if you like men in your body, you say 'yes' - he then continues -- 'he asks if you'd like to suck his cock.</p> <p>Sarah knew this was a little too far, but was able to look at Josh as he sat listening to his wife speak.</p> <p>He told her that it'd work like that.</p> <p>She said no, she'd be there. They went back to the bar and sat. The bartender went back to the phone. One time he took one of her nipples in his fingers and pinched and twisted it. She told him he'd better stop doing that, and he pulled his fingers away. He asked for another drink from the table he'd had his fingers in. Now, she really got to work on this game. By the time she got there, she had her hand in her lap and was rubbing her clit as if she were making sure her husband liked that. She was getting closer to cumming.</p> <p>The man sat down beside her and started talking to her. 'Oh yeah, girl - sucking your nipples. Now, you're enjoying yourself.' Sarah was getting close now. 'Oh God, I wanna cum, baby - let me suck your tits. Would you like to feel me shoot my cum in this mouth? I want to give you a facial, Sarah.'</p> <p>She looked at the bartender, who was watching.</p> <p>'Just look at the phone. I want to finish the drink.' She said to the bartender. As the bartender moved, Sarah gave the man her other hand, grabbed the bottle and said 'cum now - on my tits.' She squeezed his fingers harder and started cumming again. The man put the phone on the side table and moved back to his chair.</p> <p>The man stood up, reached over, placed the bottle on Sarah's right breast, his right hand holding the bottle, leaned over, took her left nipple, and sucked on it... she couldn't wait any more.</p> <p>The man lifted his head off her breast and looked at her and asked her 'would you do me a favor and keep this up?"</p> <p>'Sure' she said.</p> <p>"I don't want to cum in my hand and end up with some kind of mess on the other one, but, if you're too horny, you won't mind the other one?"</p> <p>"It'd be my pleasure."</p> <p>"So, what will you do from now on?" he said to her</p> <p>"... You tell him to go to hell."</p> <p>"Yeah, I do. If you're too turned on... just let them come out and cum."</p> <p>"Sure, of course. Here's what I'll do." She took another sip of the rum and cayenne.</p> <p>"How about we go out one night... I want to fuck you a bit."</p> <p>"Ok."</p> <p>"But... I'm not really an American, so, it's not really the same."</p> <p>"So, if you're not, you leave right now?"</p> <p>"Of course - it would be good company, though. I could talk to my wife to see if she's interested..."</p> <p>"OK, see you aroundâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
