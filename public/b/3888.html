I told myself that I could always call her and, while she was out of town, I’d talk to her and we could start over!</p> <p>I watched as Beth got dressed and then I sat down. She said, “Hey, this has to end soon, I’m going to bed.”</p> <p>I said, “Ok, just get your gear and I will walk you up to the door.”</p> <p>When we got inside the house I looked at how the house looked, it had a little pool to sit on as well as a large porch and some chairs that were out in the house. That reminded me of my bedroom as well, it was big enough to hold two people. As we walked over to the porch I looked at Beth in her little blue bikini and noticed something more and then said, “Honey, this looks nice! If I had this place all to myself I might not have to wonder what it would be like to be with a complete stranger!”</p> <p>“It is nice and warm, don’t they all have the heat of a sauna,” said Beth.</p> <p>“I like that too!”</p> <p>“Come on in and you can get changed; its just down the hall from your room, where you could change there.”</p> <p>Beth looked around the house and said, “This is nice! I wish I had some money for a nice place like this.”</p> <p>We walked towards the bedroom and saw the front door open and closed. There were two large shower heads on the wall next to each of the stairs. The bathroom door was on the left and we could see Beth changing into a tiny bikini bathing suit, then walked back towards the shower. Beth pulled off the top and said, “Well I have to change into something else, do you mind?”</p> <p>I said, “Sure come on in and lets get showered.”</p> <p>We walked in the bedroom, it was the same one and we walked towards the door, then down a short hallway and into one of the bedrooms. I looked at the closet and saw that it was one big room. The closet has a couple of drawers and a couple of closets and a couple of drawers and a small couch. The bed was on the left side, it was a deep blue, with a big white fluffy comforter and pillows. The windows are all open and there was a hot tub and a small enclosed shower.</p> <p>Beth said, “Would you like some refreshment to go with your dinner?”</p> <p>I said, “Sure let’s have some drinks right here!”</p> <p>I went over and got the two glasses of water, as I walked over to the table I said, “Here, let me wash them,” and I handed one to Beth and said, “Here, you can get a wash cloth, if you want.” Beth returned with the cloth, then got a clean wash cloth and said, “No, you just clean that, it’s your shower.”</p> <p>I said, “Ok then, but hurry up honey!”</p> <p>When Beth came out of the bathroom with the glass of water and a wash cloth, her body turned a little pink and then she said, “Omigod, you mean I was being unfaithful?”</p> <p>I said, “Yeah, like that’s cheating.”</p> <p>After a minute or so of silence as we said nothing, I said, “Beth, I’ve got to put on some clothes for some other guests.”</p> <p>Beth looked at me, then she said, “What does your going shopping do?”</p> <p>“There are clothes there that I can change in and a pair of shorts and some golf shirts. Then I can show them to you when you get home from work.”</p> <p>After talking for a few minutes, I had to get up and change after looking over at Beth as she was walking back into the bedroom. I looked into the bedroom looking for an outfit to wear. I found a pair of old shorts and a black shirt and went outside to help get it out from under the lounge chair.
