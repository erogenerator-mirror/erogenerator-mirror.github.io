Come dance with me."</p> <p>It took me a few moments to compose myself even while he took a seat in one of the high chairs facing out. I felt a certain amount of discomfort that made me uneasy, the more I held myself back, the more time I spent with him. Our faces were inches from each other; if one of us didn't stop smiling he seemed to know what was wrong with me.</p> <p>I noticed that despite the silence his face was still slightly flushed and his eyes had a certain sliver of anger and it made me feel a bit uncomfortable. When he pulled out his foot stool to stand close behind me I found that my pulse had picked up. It was as if we were still in the middle of some sort of ritual.</p> <p>"Merry Christmas, Santa."</p> <p>I heard a chuckle escape from his lips before I felt him put his hand on my shoulder.</p> <p>"Merry Christmas to all of you. As you know I have been invited to the annual Christmas party of my own and only a couple of my friends and I are present. We will have a great party and you will be the entertainment. We are here to celebrate Christmas and to share our experiences and all of it. Now I've been thinking about asking you to come again and again but I've just kept getting frustrated with myself."</p> <p>I didn't know what to say, I could feel his eyes on me and I wasn't sure if it was his eyes or his voice.</p> <p>"Come again and again."</p> <p>I glanced down at his lap and found that he had taken a napkin from a table and was dabbing at his eye as he spoke.</p> <p>"You can come again and again on Christmas, but I suggest this is in your hands as much as ours or I don't get a chance to spend Christmas in my lap."</p> <p>Oh shit, it all just felt like my own personal Christmas party. And I didn't even know what to say.</p> <p>"We're sure glad to celebrate Christmas together again."</p> <p>I started to cry. I was just happy he wasn't talking about sex with strangers, which had been his excuse to go to the Christmas party as opposed to me being on a public forum. And although it wasn't really bad, maybe I should have felt bad about what he had done.</p> <p>"There, you've been through quite a shock. Happy birthday."</p> <p>"Thank you sir."</p> <p>"Come." He gestured with a hand toward the door and I left. I got to my car and went to my apartment. I sat there in the passenger seat, just staring off the road for a long time. I decided I could try to think of something to do. I needed a drink, something to take my mind off the present I had just got. As soon as I got home I went to my computer, sat down at the computer and went to the mail account.</p> <p>The next morning was Friday and I would wake up first thing after a really stressful night. I got up to get ready for work. When I got to the desk I just stood in front of my phone staring at it for a few moments while I did my best to focus my attention. When I saw one of the email addresses I opened it and found a message waiting for me to read.</p> <p>"Hey sss... I've really missed you. The party has been wonderful but I need some time alone with some things that I need to get from that party. Be home in time for this party.</p> <p>As usual I was in a hurry. I was in no mood to be alone and not have people to talk to so I skipped the party anyway.</p> <p>Anyway, I was going to try getting the night off to a better start. I had gotten a message from a good friend on the way from work to say that they had the place to myself when the party was about to start and had rented a suite for the night.</p> <p>I arrived at the place a few minutes before the party would start but it took a good ten minutes before I saw that I was in a good part of town so I started to change into something a bit less extravagant. It didn't take me long to find a nice designer shirt that fit tightly and left me feeling pretty good but it made me feel cheap as I left the shop wearing a cheap button down shirt of thin cotton that clung almost to my chest. That's when I noticed it was very low-low and it really accentuated my hourglass figure.</p> <p>It was about four or five minutes before the night started.
