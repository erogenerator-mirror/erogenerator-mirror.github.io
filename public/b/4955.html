You just pissed over a stupid little kid."</p> <p>He said nothing. The guy looked around to see how the hell he was making things go with his eyes.</p> <p>"Okay, but you're dead. So what the hell did you call the asshole you really were?"</p> <p>"I called the asshole the person I would have done anything to just get rid of a pissed-off kid."</p> <p>"What did you call me?"</p> <p>"I called you asshole."</p> <p>"What the fuck do you mean? I didn't call you asshole."</p> <p>"You are no big deal. What happened, you didn't tell me."</p> <p>"You didn't believe me."</p> <p>"So what was your motive for all this? You don't want me dead."</p> <p>"Let me get this straight...you want me dead."</p> <p>As he said this, he got really pissed and walked to the door and opened it. His voice was not quite as confident as the one he was speaking to. He closed the door and turned the lock to close and lock the door. He walked over and stared at the person standing against the door. "It's not like I'm a threat; it's something I can handle."</p> <p>"Okay." "I saw the guy with the pistol, so I thought you knew that.</p> <p>"Yeah, but I was not going to stand there and watch my wife get murdered. I'm not going to tell her the truth."</p> <p>"Do that. It wasn't her fault. I had to do some damn thing."</p> <p>"You got it."</p> <p>"What the hell do you want?"</p> <p>"Why isn't your gun in your pants?"</p> <p>He laughed. "It was my fault. I should have put it away before I walked in here."</p> <p>"Get your ass downstairs. What's in this asshole's hands has to do with you," he demanded.</p> <p>"I am not your . . .your goddamn fucking wife."</p> <p>"Let me get this straight. I'm not her."</p> <p>"Don't you dare insult her, asshole."</p> <p>"Don't you dare insult me."</p> <p>"You do nothing but shit on this couch."</p> <p>"What do you want, asshole?"</p> <p>"Get yourself a gun."</p> <p>With that, he turned and walked toward the door without even taking his hat off. Once he was out of sight of the bodyguard, he turned around and walked back to his patrol car. He opened the door, slid in, and climbed in. The door shut. He turned and looked at the bodyguard.</p> <p>"Is that you?"</p> <p>"Yeah. Do you want to tell us who it was?" "That was me. Who else would I give that fucking gun to?"</p> <p>The man glared at his partner, who looked at the bodyguard.</p> <p>"I'll tell you what else. What are you going to do with the gun you said you owned at that party, now that he's gone? What do you have in there to do with those?"</p> <p>"I don't know. What else do you need?"</p> <p>"Get yourself another gun. There's plenty of things there to use as well. Tell you what, we may be able to get what it takes to send you down to the lobby to pick up a corpse. Why don't you come back and help yourself to any other gun that you'll be able to use to get your hands on, if you will please?"</p> <p>"This is not true. I'm not her. The police are not a threat to me. It's none of your fucking business."</p> <p>The man looked at him and then back at the bodyguard. "I have you to face, not the asshole who killed your wife. Now get yourself a gun and get off our property before I kill your wife."</p> <p>The bodyguard's voice took on a calmness to it. "That's enough, buddy. Take yourself to that desk over there and get a gun. We'll have you all day, man."</p> <p>"The desk over there," said the patrolman as he pointed the car toward the hotel. He paused and turned back to the bodyguards. "You can go ahead and bring all of your bags up to the room, while I check to make sure we're in the right location."</p> <p>When the bodyguard opened the door to the hotel, he turned to face the bodyguard.</p> <p>"Please sit with me while those young people go to work, Mr. Caruthers."</p> <p>"Can I see the gun?"</p> <p>"No, you wait there. The gun is in my hands."</p> <p>He turned to the bodyguard and said, "You're not going to believe this.
