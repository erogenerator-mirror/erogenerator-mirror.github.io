I sigh in content as his fingers roam the length of my body. I feel him tug at my clothes, he quickly slips out of them, and my legs part. He begins at my neck, rubbing over all the sensitive spots that cause me to shiver under him, his fingertips brush over my lips, my thighs. His touch makes me melt into him, and he leans down and kisses me again. I pull away to breathe in quickly.</p> <p>"I need to get on my knees right now," I laugh. "Just do what you're thinking of, and you'll be fine." He's all smiles, and he takes my hand and pulls me toward the bed. At the top of the stairs, I stand before us, naked, my skin still trembling from the after rush of excitement. He's standing beside the bed, and I feel him tug on the thin straps of his shirt. Once he removes it, I hear the rustling of cloth on fabric.</p> <p>"I'll do your back."</p> <p>I can hardly breath, but I nod my head and agree, and he runs his hand down the back of my arms, over my lower back and down over my butt. The cool night air and his breath make my skin tingle, as he makes his way down my calves and kneels beside me in front of me. I feel his fingers caress my inner thigh, but he doesn't touch me yet. I feel his fingers brush over my lips, and I take them between my teeth, biting them gently with my lips. He's smiling and I know he's teasing me, but somehow it feels just as dangerous, as I might have been a century back and this was my first time. I try to control my voice, but I can't. I'm so nervous, and excited that I can't really say anything, and I feel his hands run up my thighs, under my skirt. He feels my bare pussy under her flimsy panties, and for the first time I can see the moisture there. I feel his fingers press against my lips, barely touching them, and I'm afraid I might scream in pleasure. I'm afraid that I may just want him to touch me anyhow. I'd hate to disappoint him once, and have to beg him to take my virginity.</p> <p>He's inching closer to me now, his pants and underwear are wet with me as he comes closer. He grasps my hips and I'm afraid he'll fall on me. I think he wants to get me off first, and I feel like he wants my body to give him some kind of reward. I shake my head, but he doesn't stop. Soon, the tip of his thick finger slips in between my outer lips, and I'm shaking in anticipation. He pulls back, and I can barely breathe. I think I might just scream. I can't. The look of fear that flickers over his face as he takes off his shirt, his belt loops, his pants. He's just like any other man- a hard man- for me. He stands only with his boxers on. He looks into my eyes intently, as if asking permission. I can barely make out what he looks like. His hard muscles, but not a monster, not fat or over-muscled like me. He smiles seductively, and I can't help but touch his cock again. He's standing up now, my hand running up and down his length. He puts his palms up and leans down to kiss me again, and soon our tongues are dancing in a hot and sloppy duel. I feel him press down hard against my hand and he moans. I'm thinking he must just want to fuck me.</p> <p>As he picks me up, with me cradled against his chest, his hands slip up my dress, my nakedness suddenly exposed to his eyes. He begins his undressing of me slowly, kissing his way down my back, over my cheeks and on down my neck to my navel. I'm shivery and excited as he works over me, my skin tingling with goose bumps over his lips and tongue. His lips are hot over my skin, his breath hot on me as he kisses through my hair. He kisses down across my stomach, over my stomach button, and down the line of my skirt. He pauses when he gets to the edge of my panties, and slowly pulls them down and off, letting my sex spring free from its silken prison. I'm wet now, and I'm moaning softly as my naked skin catches his full attention. He licks at me, his tongue working inside my pussy, just as I like it. It feels so good, and the hot, hot, wet sensation of his tongue on my flesh, feels so very good. I don't move, and he does my upper back, too, gently but firmly, and thenâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
