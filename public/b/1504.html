I did it in your back seat." I thought she had been watching us for awhile but she got up and walked out of my room.</p> <p>She knocked on the door. After a few minutes, I opened the door. We walked inside saying "hi" and went into my bedroom. She pushed me back on my bed and went around to untie my hands. "So, what's it going to be, you take me or you just go outside and drive for your own enjoyment?" I got up off of the bed after a minute and looked at her. "Are you sure, there's no rush?"</p> <p>"No, go and have fun. We'll take it from here."</p> <p>I walked to my dresser and started back to the mirror to change my clothes. I took off my shirt and jeans and turned out the lights. I tossed my clothes on the floor and started to make my way to the mirror. She went to the window, opened the drawer and smiled, as I came up behind her, wrapping my arms around her.</p> <p>"Wow." She was not wearing a bra and I ran my hands up and down her arms. "Thank for making me this happy."</p> <p>I kissed her neck and shoulders and then moved her shirt over her shoulders and off, leaving her standing in her sheer white bra. She leaned into me a little putting her face in my neck which I ran my hands up and down her chest, and up to her breasts which were not as large as she remembered but they sure had that nice feel. I was kissing up her neck and ear when she reached out, untied my belt and unzipped the side of my jeans.</p> <p>"God you feel great." Her bra strap fell off.</p> <p>She reached around my chest, slipped the bra off, revealing my breasts. "They feel great as always. I can't wait to put mine on."</p> <p>She lifted her body up till she got the pants off. I took her bra off, looked at her perfect breast for a second before I kissed her, kissing the inside of her upper chest. She ran her fingers through my hair and ran her fingers through my curls. I moved down, kissing her stomach and slowly worked my way up. "Your stomach is nice and soft," I said.</p> <p>She looked up at me, "I remember you saying that when we were dancing." I kissed her stomach and moved my kisses up to her chest and began sucking her nipple gently and flicking it with my tongue. This caused her to moan louder than she had since the first time I had done that. My hands moved back to her side as I sucked on her breast for a minute then began moving up to take her other nipple in my mouth. It grew to life in my mouth and I could feel her body shaking a little as I ran my other hand up her leg and into her panties. I could feel the heat of her pussy through her panties. I looked up into her eyes, her breathing was more rapid and I could see her chest heave and her eyes were closed.</p> <p>I moved lower and began to run my tongue along her lips, which looked like they were going to explode. She moaned louder and ran her fingers across my face then around my mouth until I pulled her wet pussy to my mouth. It tasted great as always, but there was a little more to it as I ran my tongue and teeth over her.</p> <p>She put her finger into my mouth, "You'll like this more than the last times I did it," and moved from my mouth to my face. I could feel how much her tongue wanted to move in my mouth as I ran my teeth along her and felt her pussy tighten up, which only made her juices flow out. "That's it, put your tongue in me now," she panted.</p> <p>I slid my mouth down over her pussy and slowly moved my tongue in and out while she slowly went to her head to put some pressure on my tongue and lips. I moved my tongue up and down, up, down and in her pussy a little as she did the same with her mouth. I ran my hand back up her thigh and pushed my fingers in her pussy a little more so they slid in further into her pussy.</p> <p>She put one hand on the back of my head and pressed me toward her harder. Her leg and hips went off the bed as she moved her hips from side to side and grabbed the back of my head with both hands and I felt her pussy tighten up around my tongue. She moaned and pushed my head into her.</p> <p>"Yes. Oh...oh. Yes. YES!" She came with one last shudder. I could feel her juices on my chin and nose as she came a second time. I moved my head slowly from between her legsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
