You know that, right?'</p> <p>She shook her head.</p> <p>"I'll be back before you know it."</p> <p>She looked at the door for a while before turning toward the shower.</p> <p>"I'm not sure if..." she said as she stepped into the bathroom.</p> <p>When she got completely in the shower, I took the opportunity to check on her as well. It wasn't until I got to the bedroom that I realized she wasn't even in bed yet. I looked down the hall and saw her still out and in the shower. She had apparently finished drying her hair, so she was standing there in just a towel. She looked so... beautiful. Even through the towel it was clear that she was very sexually experienced.</p> <p>"What?" I asked.</p> <p>"I'm so glad you're here, Jeremy," she said as she took his hand and led him toward the bedroom.</p> <p>"Where are you going?"</p> <p>"To shower."</p> <p>"Can I join you?" She asked as she picked up her towel.</p> <p>"No! You go ahead and undress."</p> <p>As soon as she closed the door, she was down on her knees. Before I could protest, she took my belt in her teeth and unfastened it. My boxers were as well, and she pulled them down slowly.</p> <p>"Come on, honey. You have to get dressed too."</p> <p>She was undressing so fast that she was almost as naked as I was. She sat on the bed and watched some television until I joined her. She'd taken all the toys out of the dresser and set them aside for her.</p> <p>"Your turn," she said as she stepped out of the dress and stood naked in front of me.</p> <p>As she picked up my robe and left the bedroom that she had lit, she reached into the drawer and fished around until she finally pulled out some body lotion. She started rubbing it onto her body while she kissed me.</p> <p>She looked absolutely gorgeous and so incredibly sexy. I wasn't sure if this was the result of being at the top of our sex-crazed cycle, but it was incredibly sexy. It also gave her a slight chill that would have set off alarm bells, so I took her hand from my now hard cock and moved her onto her back.</p> <p>The look of concern on the other woman's face told me I was still a little too aroused for anything else. Without further discussion, she reached between her legs to rub the lotion down her thighs with both hands. As I worked the lotion in one hand, she took that hand and put it between her legs. She rubbed her middle finger in the lotion a few times until she was completely slick. She turned her hips to invite me in, but didn't force it. She was ready.</p> <p>I slid my hand beneath her so I could start kissing her breasts. They were larger than most women's, and felt firmer and cooler than she did. Her pink nipples were stiffening in my mouth as I moved from one to the other. I slipped a finger between her inner lips and pressed into her. She didn't moan. She didn't say a word. She just lay there and let me do whatever I wanted.</p> <p>I could have moved on top of her, but she pushed back to make it easier. It certainly felt like fun to watch the other woman. I'm not sure what I was more curious about: what had happened to me or what, but watching her get aroused and get off made my heart pound. I was about to touch her while I had the same effect I had seen on the other woman.</p> <p>Suddenly that hand left her breasts. It was replaced by a pair of soft hands. I didn't know what to expect when my fingers found themselves buried in a female vagina. Neither was much of anything, but the pussy they found felt pretty, if slightly different. I suspected that they were a bit thicker than the other pussy, and I felt no way that it wasn't a natural change. I wanted to be on my knees between her thighs, between her legs, sucking and licking and fucking her with my tongue, so I wouldn't leave out a second moan as I brought her to orgasm.</p> <p>Before I could make any sort of attempt to fuck that sexy pussy, it was too late. Her hips lifted and she pressed her pussy against my mouth.</p> <p>"Ah, Jeremy. Your mouth feels so good," she groaned.</p> <p>I didn't waste time deciding whether to give her anything more than a couple of seconds of teasing. I was still trying to decide when she gaveâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
