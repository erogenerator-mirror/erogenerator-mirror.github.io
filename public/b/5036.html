I asked,</p> <p>"May I ask a personal question?"</p> <p>She smiled and held my hand.</p> <p>"May I join you in the hot tub?"</p> <p>She was quite attractive in a rugged kind of way, the way women who are comfortable with men look. She smiled and we walked in together. We got the hot tub started and it was really relaxing. She asked me to sit beside her, I sat beside her and we had a very comfortable conversation,</p> <p>I couldn't help but notice she looked at me as well, I realized just looking at her breasts was making me get hard. I told her I would have to get a drink. She said,</p> <p>"I'll take that as a 'yes'."</p> <p>We sat for a short while, we just talked like the two of you were friends, she seemed like she didn't really know us both very well. Finally she said,</p> <p>"I need to ask you something."</p> <p>I had a hard time keeping my voice quiet, she smiled again and said, "I'm not sure I want to talk about this right now."</p> <p>We stayed in the tub and she started to ask me all kinds of questions. I was in heaven just listening to her. I knew I was going to be late for work.</p> <p>"I can tell you have to drive back to the house and then we are going to sit and talk awhile, come back about tomorrow."</p> <p>I could see she was really beginning to enjoy our little conversation. She continued,</p> <p>"Do you think it was okay for me to tell you this?"</p> <p>I could hear that she was about to say something, but after a time she finished,</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Thank you."</p> <p>"No! Thank you!" she smiled again.</p> <p>I could feel myself getting hard again even though I was really excited having just been talking to her. She said,</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>We were both speechless for a while. After saying our goodbyes she stood up, I got up to stand and she said she needed to take a shower so I went and got her a towel. When I returned she was standing there naked with water on her beautiful body, her nipples were standing up like diamonds. She smiled and said,</p> <p>"Thank you."</p> <p>I couldn't keep my eyes off her breasts, and then down her body. She was looking at me with a bit of a devious smile, she pulled back the shower curtain then said to me,</p> <p>"If that was your wish I am certainly willing to do that."</p> <p>I just stared straight in her and I mean really stared straight in her eyes. She stepped into the shower and got under the shower head and let the water wash over her long legs and feet. I couldn't help it she was gorgeous. She asked me to take her soaping sponge and I stood there waiting but she didn't say a word and I just sat there and let her wash my body then got out the shower head and started to rinse her off. As I was rinsing her off she turned and asked me to turn off the water so we could take some towels and dry ourselves.</p> <p>I was shocked but she just smiled and came back into the bathroom with a fresh towel. She laid the towels on the floor next to the jacuzzi's and then she asked me to lie down. I told her to go ahead, and she sat down with me and we just lay there for about a minute. Then she started to kiss me and we started to kiss and we got more passionate. I guess we started to get more passionate and then she took my right hand and put it on the side of her breast. I was about to do that when she said,</p> <p>"Not here, right now."</p> <p>I knew what she had in mind but we had to make sure we didn't do anything that would hurt or make her mad. So I started to rub her breast lightly with my left hand, then I started to slowly trace my fingers from front to back with the tip of my index finger. It caused the other breast to be in my hand and it felt really good. I was feeling pretty good myself, the feeling was all around my fingers and my hand was getting really slippery with her saliva. Then we broke the kiss and we just lay there.</p> <p>Just holding each other in my mind did that to me. As I was rubbing her nipple her moans were becoming more frequent. She had removed my hands from her breast and was gently stroking my chest and belly. Then she looked at my face and saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
