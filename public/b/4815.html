His cock."</p> <p>"No, he's not going that far, I didn't."</p> <p>A new understanding dawned.</p> <p>"My husband wouldn't let go."</p> <p>I didn't understand why.</p> <p>"Not until we know more. I want to learn more first, before I go off."</p> <p>To my surprise in that second the expression was that of a smile.</p> <p>There was another question on my mind, "What did I ever do to you?"</p> <p>"Well, my question is about me?"</p> <p>I didn't know what to say. Here I was wondering what I was supposed to do and I didn't know if the answer would be yes or no. Or maybe I was supposed to go along with that and see if things progressed beyond the next day.</p> <p>"How long do you want me to go on this vacation?"</p> <p>"Three weeks."</p> <p>There was that smile again. "I think I know what you mean."</p> <p>I was now thinking about how I would be going off on a cruise the next day. When I thought about it more it made sense and for that reason I was thinking about the cruise coming with the company instead of me.</p> <p>"So you agree."</p> <p>"My decision has already been made."</p> <p>"No it doesn't."</p> <p>I wanted to stop what we were doing and say that we had nothing in common. That it was wrong. But I could not. Because that was the first time in this relationship that I had said those words to him.</p> <p>"So where do you plan to go on this cruise?"</p> <p>"The Bahamas."</p> <p>"Really? That doesn't sound too bad."</p> <p>"It isn't, but it does seem to be a bit unusual."</p> <p>"Just relax and try not to go on the cruise. That is, if you want."</p> <p>"I want. Yes, I want."</p> <p>"That is exactly what you are."</p> <p>"Yes, I want. But, I need to move on as a woman."</p> <p>I realized it was time to take a more direct route. I smiled and went on,</p> <p>"I don't know why but, knowing that you and the cruise are on the same ship, I made the decision that I must go on a cruise."</p> <p>That brought my back to the cruise and the thought of all those years of waiting for my chance at a cruise that I had waited so long to feel again. I wasn't about to say a single word to anyone that wasn't my husband. But, I was thinking now with a different purpose.</p> <p>"I want to know that what you want is what I want too." I paused and reached out and touched my husband's face. "I want to be your wife."</p> <p>My heart skipped a beat at that. How could he respond like that? This was something I was supposed to be asking him to do. This was something we both were supposed to be talking about.</p> <p>I moved my hands to his cheeks to kiss him as I moved to kiss him again. I felt my knees weaken as we kissed. I kissed my husband deeply and passionately as his hands moved to my breasts. He caressed them, as I felt my nipples harden by the light touch of his warm hands. I felt my body become wet, and I was already moving toward the climax of this moment. I had to stop this now. Maybe before we went to sleep we could do this in the bedroom. I moved my body so I could press harder into his as our lips parted. I held his lips close for a kiss, our tongues dancing in a tight embrace that grew hotter, heavier, faster.</p> <p>My body was tingling all over. I felt the start of my climax, and suddenly there was a noise inside of me that was more painful than anything I had ever felt. I turned to see my husband and look into his eyes as the pleasure of this moment rushed over me. My body trembled as waves of pleasure pulsed through my body. My whole mind seemed to freeze. I was in ecstasy.</p> <p>My body collapsed and I was a shell of a woman who was no longer with our relationship.</p> <p>He pulled me tightly against him.</p> <p>I looked into his eyes, my smile wide with the wonder of the moment, and said, "You're the best husband a woman could ever want. It feels so right."</p> <p>He returned my smile and said that he could never think of being with any woman like that. He knew that in many other situations it wouldn't be right. He felt that I wouldn't hurt him. I never loved anyone, only his wifeâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
