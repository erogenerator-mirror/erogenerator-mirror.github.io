She began to cum again and again as she bucked her body back upward and slammed her ass hard into the side of the bed. Her knees began to turn to rubber and the bed began to creak louder as Lisa’s orgasm rippled through her like a storm wave against a shoreline.</p> <p>“That’s it baby, cum for me. Spurt for me, cum with me,” Lisa encouraged her as she felt her whole body shudder and spasm. Her pussy spasmed powerfully and she felt as if she would burst and then it was just a weak throb.</p> <p>The orgasm passed and soon after Lisa was breathing hard and lying totally exhausted on the bed.

Lisa was so grateful to her lover for saving her life. It was the happiest moment of her life and she felt elated. As Lisa was pulling back from her lover's kiss, she saw her face in the mirror. The woman in the mirror was no longer this ugly woman but a woman whom she would love to live her life with.
