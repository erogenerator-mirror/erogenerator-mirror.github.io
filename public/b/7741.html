I whispered, not realizing that I was speaking aloud.</p> <p>He reached out and placed his hand on my shoulders, turning me to face the wall again. He pulled me into him, pressing himself against my thigh. I put my arms around his neck and we kissed deeply. We kissed for what seemed like hours. Our bodies touched and pressed together like a pair of teenagers as we kissed. Our tongues pressed against each other while our arms came to rest on his shoulders. We moved to the music again, turning the song off before putting it back on the pause and resuming our position in the crowd.</p> <p>This time, however, he did not let me go, instead pulling my body against his as he slipped his hand in between our bodies. He cupped my breasts in his hands and rubbed his thumb across my nipples. My clit tingled as we made out. When I slid my hands down his chest, he cupped my bottom and moved it, so that it rubbed along the length of his engorged cock. When his thumb was between my wet lips, I parted them and his thumb found my clit. My lips parted around his fingers and his thumb began to massage. He felt so good, he was a wonder, I kept thinking about making love to him. When my face flushed and my desire became unbearable, I lifted my lips from his fingers and looked at him.</p> <p>"God, what have we gotten into. How long has this been going on?" I whispered, trying to bring a smile to his face.</p> <p>"I was planning on having more than one of us make love to each other."</p> <p>With that, I felt his hand begin to slide off my hip, stopping between my legs. He began to caress my inner thigh. His hand ran along the length of my pussy, parting the lips more easily. I felt him dip his head and his tongue slide along my clit. I felt the tension in his mouth as he sucked on my clit. He lifted his face up and ran his tongue over my lips, tasting my juices in his mouth. He slid a finger inside and moved it in and out and then quickly withdrew it again. His hand continued to slide up and down my body.</p> <p>"Ohhhhh."</p> <p>His mouth found my pussy lips again and sucked hard on them while his finger slid in and out of my wet pussy. I felt his finger enter me and he continued his onslaught on my clit. My hands slid down his body and down over his waist. I pulled his body tight against mine and moaned loudly. His finger moved deeper, making wet squishing noises as he probed deeper. He moved his finger faster as he drove me close to the edge. There was no turning back now. My hips bucked, thrusting against his every movement.</p> <p>I felt his finger move to my asshole and he moved his hand over, separating my cheeks to look at my hole. He placed his finger right inside me, pulling it in and out, stretching my insides with it. I gasped, my body tightening up. His finger continued to work its magic until I was on the edge of orgasm. He removed his finger and stood up. I pulled him with me, I pulled him and kissed him, our bodies still pressed together. His finger left my ass, I could barely catch my breath, and we ran into the crowd again.</p> <p>"I guess that we have some explaining." I said, laughing.</p> <p>We walked down the stairs hand in hand. I held onto his hand as we made our way to the car. He opened the door as I climbed in and we climbed in. He put her seat belt on. "I'm going to take a quick shower now." He said.</p> <p>"Thank you very much. I'll watch out the window. I'll be home in just a minuteâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
