I closed my eyes and just went with it. It was too much. My second orgasm of the day was now on it's way. I had never had an orgasm without sex. I didn't want to let anything go too long without it.</p> <p>I felt my husband's fingers slip between my thighs as he brought his face down to my pussy, and I felt the warmth of his lips just barely touching my moist flesh. I knew I wasn't going to last much longer. My second orgasm of the day was building, and my pussy was leaking juices like a sieve, and I was going to come like a river.</p> <p>It was too much. I was trying to breathe through my mouth, but my whole body was shaking.</p> <p>My husband's lips touched my clit again at just the right time, and in that second I felt his tongue slide up and down a little more, then he began to slide his finger into my hot pussy.</p> <p>Instinctively, I lifted my hips off the couch. A powerful orgasm ripped through my body like a powerful wave. My hips went into a different mode, pulling on and forcing myself up to the ceiling.</p> <p>I could feel a climax coming. The pressure was building up with the pressure building in the rest of my body, and building until I couldn't control it anymore. My body, my pussy, my thighs, and my pussy were all on fire with lust, and I came with the force of a tidal surge of lust. The pressure went off like a thunderbolt in my brain, and the pressure of her climax brought me out of my sleep. My husband had come across me, he had been licking my pussy and ass, and I had cum. It was like a hurricane of lust was building in my body, and I couldn't move. All my energy was focused on fucking him. I didn't even know that I could do something while coming that hard.</p> <p>I don't think anything had ever felt so good. I felt his face against my pussy, and his fingers in my vagina. I didn't even realize that my legs had spread apart. Just after I got over the intense orgasm that had hit me, I became aware that I was shaking with the force of the release that felt like a tidal wave.</p> <p>As I lay there with my legs spread wide open, my husband slipped a finger into my pussy again and started finger fucking me. I felt him add another finger, and I closed my eyes again to concentrate on the pleasure that was slowly building up in my body, while he fucked his fingers between my legs. I started to come again, this time with more intensity.</p> <p>The contractions of my orgasm got stronger when my body stopped shaking. Just as I felt myself starting to come down again, I started to feel something that I can't explain. It had to be the force of the orgasm. My whole body was trembling. I don't remember if anything ever happened before, but the feeling of the orgasm brought on it. I didn't even care about anything that I think I knew about it.</p> <p>For two or three minutes, I had the most powerful orgasm I had ever experienced, and everything went back to normal. I didn't notice anything anymore, but he was still buried inside me.</p> <p>He slowly slipped himself out of me, and I was still on my stomach. He picked me up and carried me back to my bedroom, which he threw into my closet. Then he laid me down on my bed, and went back to taking his clothes off.</p> <p>I had nothing to do after that, I slept in this room for over an hour. I couldn't have let it continue this way, and the thought had never crossed my mind, but it still felt good to have him in me again. I was still shaking with sexual tension, and it had not taken long before I was ready for another orgasm.</p> <p>He wasn't the biggest thing I had ever had, and I knew he wouldn't fill me completely. I just needed a little relief.</p> <p>After I fell asleep, I heard my husband walking up to my door for more time, but I woke up before he did, and was sitting up in bed a second time. Once again I was still sleeping when I heard the door open, and I got out of bed and went to check on my husband.</p> <p>He came in for what seemed like half an hour, as Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
