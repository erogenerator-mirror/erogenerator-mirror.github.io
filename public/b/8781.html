I mean, I know you said that I was pretty, but wow, this..."</p> <p>She reached out and ran her finger down my cock, which responded by growing and harder in her hand. She turned, lifted the shirt to expose my chest, and began to slowly lick and kiss my nipples. She kept up this little ritual until I was moaning and she was on her knees. Looking up, she smiled, and then took both my hands and pushed them towards her breasts. I was amazed by this, but then I felt a hand on my cock. Taking it in her hand, she began to stroke it, while her head made little circles on my stomach. I could feel my orgasm coming, and I had to warn her. Pulling away, she took my hand away, and as I was standing up, she took hold of my cock, and led it to her.</p> <p>"You still have a thing for women, Paulie, and I'm sure you wouldn't mind if I told you that you'd want to fuck another girl with me." As she said it, she took her bra off, revealing a set of large C-cups. The nipples were almost as big as mine but not quite, and she teased me by rubbing them gently, and then pinching them, before pulling away and saying, "Well, you can come whenever you like, right? But first, I want to make sure you'll have a chance for it when you get home." I was still so hard, but I let her make the decision; she went down on me, with her lips around the tip, her tongue moving lightly over it, before engulfing it fully in her mouth.</p> <p>I began to thrust into her mouth, my hips pushing upwards, and I could feel my balls beginning to lift off my body, and I knew I wouldn't last long at this rate. She didn't even try to hold me, and she began bobbing up and down on my cock faster, while rubbing her hands up and down again and again. I could feel my balls rising with each thrust, and I knew it wouldn't be long at all. I pushed her off, and she looked up at me and smiled. She lay down on her back, and I straddled her, so I was sitting on her chest, with my cock pointing to the ceiling. Lifting her head up, I moved her around so that she was sitting on top of me, and our mouths met, and we French-kissed passionately for several minutes, before I was ready to explode.</p> <p>"Are you feeling as good as you told me?" I whispered into her ear, before I began to pound her as hard as I could. She moaned softly every time I pulled away from her, and I could feel her pussy tightening around my cock.</p> <p>The pressure built in my balls, so I reached in my hand and began to stroke them, as she wrapped her legs around me, and rocked back and forth on my cock while pushing her mouth back hard enough up against mine to meet with her teeth biting down to make me come sooner than I thought possible, just so she could get more pleasure from me than I was. Finally, just before I had one last moan, I released my load into her mouth, and she sucked the rest down.</p> <p>"You made me come" she whispered into my ear, and kissed me again. "Thank you, Paulie." "And now you can come any time you like." She said, and we both laughed and walked out to get cleaned up and put up for the night.</p> <p>In the shower the next morning, we got dressed and went out to the bar for a coffee. We were both feeling like shit, in the middle of what felt like a terrible day, and we got a couple of free beers, before deciding to head back to the business. We sat around in front of the bar again, talking. I told her about the other guy at the bar, and how long it was going to take them to get over their encounter. I knew she didn't miss the opportunity.</p> <p>"Did you ever see his picture in the paper?" I asked her. "I think he's a pretty good artist."</p> <p>She had a look of concern as she took my question seriously. "He was the artist, Paul. When I wasn't at the art gallery, I saw him on one of the easel's I was holding over there. His painting was called 'Kitten in The New World'. How old is he now?" She looked up to ask; I leaned over and kissed her hand.</p> <p>"His art is pretty good, but he just gets a little bit of a ruck-up at his gallery. He's got some pretty good work on his easel...that one that he drew for me, but he's not really a well-known artist here.
