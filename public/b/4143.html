How about this, John?" I said.</p> <p>I was starting to get a little nervous and excited about John and how things might actually work out. I felt myself becoming excited too but was uncertain how fast I did.</p> <p>John leaned in a bit closer, just above my ear. He was whispering to me.</p> <p>"She's not so shy anymore."</p> <p>I felt a surge of excitement wash over my body, just from the thought of feeling his lips against my ear. His tongue was running from my ear down over my ear lobe. He ran his tongue along my neck as he ran his hand down to my chest.</p> <p>"Oh God." I thought, "I'm so lucky. If I didn't know better I'd think he was just fucking me and then throwing me on the bed. I'm so lucky!"</p> <p>His voice trailed off as he ran his hand over my nipple, pinching it, making me gasp, he knew how much I enjoyed that.</p> <p>"Do you like that?" he said to me.</p> <p>"What?" I whispered, breathless.</p> <p>He smiled at me and replied,</p> <p>"It feels fucking amazing!"</p> <p>He reached down into the waistband of my boxers, and I was completely startled. I'd expected him to take them off and rub my cock, just like he did with the picture he had seen.</p> <p>"What's wrong?" I asked him.</p> <p>"You know I don't think I'm ready yet, but...."</p> <p>"Please?" I repeated his request.</p> <p>"Well," he said, "I thought of you a lot. It's only been a week now. You're the most exciting person in my life." His voice trailed off as he was thinking back.</p> <p>I smiled in response. "I would agree too."</p> <p>"Well, I don't think we really have to do anything you don't want to." He said as he lightly caressed the outer rim of my ear before he pulled away. "It's not like we're going to do anything with a stranger."</p> <p>I smiled down at him. "That's very true. It's just that...."</p> <p>"I don't think you have to be nervous with me, you just have to be excited." He said, his voice still a little husky.</p> <p>I couldn't believe that I was turning into this man, who was so perfect for me. He was a perfect friend and all I needed for that experience was a good fucking.</p> <p>"So it seems like we're both just going to go along with it..." I said.</p> <p>His smile deepened into a pout. He looked at me, knowing I wanted this, but could tell I was apprehensive, he wasn't sure if he could.</p> <p>"I don't know, it's always been a fantasy for me too." He said, "but I just can't...."</p> <p>He took my hand and pulled me to him and kissed me with all the passion and heat we were feeling. His hands ran through my hair, running his hands through mine. His kisses were all over me, making me tremble.</p> <p>"Please, John, let's just take a little walk. Let's just go over to your house. I've never been in a strip club before. I'm nervous..."</p> <p>"All right. I have no problem with that." He said, kissing me passionately on my lips. I ran my hand down his back, tracing down his crack, down towards his ass. He shivered when I touched it. I put my hand at the base of his spine as we kissed and he shivered. He ran his hands up my thighs and around my ass, caressing over my skin as he went down on me. "Oh, please, John!" he cried out, "Please don't stop."</p> <p>He broke off from kissing me and walked out of the car, leaving me with trembling lips in need. I didn't understand why he was doing this. I didn't care. I was just hoping he'd hurry up and leave before he came back.</p> <p>It seems that John and I had become good friends. I guess that was part of the reason why I was so excited about the idea of maybe getting to fuck a stranger. He kept looking me up and down as the door opened, and if it hadn't been for the red lacey dress he was wearing, I don't think I would have ever taken the time to get into the car and look at the way he was dressed. The way that he carried himself; was so perfect that it made me want to do it every time he walked down the street. It also made me want to do it any time he wanted to see me.</p> <p>"Itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
