They would be fucking furiously, kissing each other madly as they made sure he got to all his reward.</p> <p>As I reached for my cell I turned the camera off and grabbed a tissue and a warm washcloth and cleaned his mess off my hands. I could hear him sobbing into the tissue but I didn't care. As I cleaned the last of it off he slowly turned to see why I'd stopped.</p> <p>"Do you have some clothes?" I asked.</p> <p>He glanced down at his shorts and smiled. He'd just showered again.</p> <p>"No, I don't..." he hesitated and stammered out, "I...um, I'm sorry I didn't want to. I can come by that evening if you want."</p> <p>His face fell, "We'd better call up our parents and tell them that we're sorry. You'll look so much better tomorrow."</p> <p>I felt a rush of excitement as we spoke of what he'd done and what we'd have together tomorrow. I hadn't even thought about it but the thought of what I would say if he came over to our house as I had. I wondered if he'd even think it as a game or even a prank.</p> <p>"No, I just had to do this. I'm sorry it took you this long."</p> <p>I smiled a smile of thanks.</p> <p>We both started laughing and he blushed as though he'd been slapped and I'd kicked him. My heart leapt in my chest!</p> <p>"What are you laughing at?" he asked.</p> <p>"I think for you, it's funny. I don't want to ruin you guys' night of fun."</p> <p>"We're not doing anything," he said.</p> <p>"Right!"</p> <p>"Yes, we are!"</p> <p>We chuckled and joked as we washed our hands and went inside where the two moms watched TV.</p> <p>"What did you do?" his mom asks.</p> <p>"I'm thinking about it."</p> <p>I watched her and he exchange smiles as she talked on the phone.</p> <p>"And?" she asked.</p> <p>"It was really cute."</p> <p>He was blushing again when the conversation stopped for a moment.</p> <p>"You don't have tan lines at all do you?"</p> <p>He looked shocked and I waited for it.</p> <p>"No!"</p> <p>"Do you think it would help if we just took off our tops on the front porch so you two could see?"</p> <p>In an answer he looked back down at himself and then stood on his tiptoes and kissed my cheek.</p> <p>"I'd like that," he said as he slid his t-shirt off and handed it to me.</p> <p>"Oh, my!" he gasped with a grin when the top was on. "It looks very nice."</p> <p>I picked up the top and put it on as he reached around to hold and hug me. Then we went into the living room where the television was sitting on the coffee table. One of our parents was on it already and we sat down, facing each other. As he gave me a hug and we both chatted I noticed that he was looking over my shoulder at me too.</p> <p>"Do you want to play with my boobs again?" he asked before taking a sip.</p> <p>"Oh you have no idea! I'm sorry, I..."</p> <p>He was having so much fun now. After a moment he finished saying, "You're a lucky man."</p> <p>"I've got no idea where this is going!" I said laughing. I started laughing at myself for being so silly and at the look on his face as he was. I felt like such a stupid girl. I wanted to take this to the next level, to be as daring as I could possibly be before we did it.</p> <p>He had one leg between mine and one leg bent back. I felt his hard bulge press against my body and I could feel it rubbing up against my leg. It felt delicious as my body pressed against his.</p> <p>"Do you usually take the risk of you being pregnant?" I asked.</p> <p>He shook his head, "No, that's not it. What if I had a kid? Would you be upset?"</p> <p>I laughed, I'd never seen him so nervous.</p> <p>"Maybe I won't be upset," I said. "Would I be too selfish?"</p> <p>He shook his head back.</p> <p>"And what if I got pregnant?"</p> <p>I started laughing again, "Oh you've got a nerve coming at me like that!"</p> <p>He looked at my expression and then back at me as he put his hands up to take a sip of his beer.</p> <p>"Are you kidding?"</p> <p>"Nope!"</p> <p>He chuckledâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
