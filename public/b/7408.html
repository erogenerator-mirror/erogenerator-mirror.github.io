It's nice and soft too," she said as she continued to lightly rub her hands up and down the length of his stiff cock.</p> <p>He was amazed at her sensuality and the way she made him feel. As she continued to rub his hardness she let her fingers stroke back and forth over the length of his erection. It was an eroticism that she knew he had never experienced and yet it was the one thing, something that he thought about as he fantasized.</p> <p>He leaned back on the bed and spread his legs out and looked down at her.</p> <p>As she continued to rub his arousal into him, she let his rigid pole disappear into her hand and then, she removed her hand from between his legs. "You don't feel that," he said and she smiled and then asked him "So, what kind of a place did you plan for me to go? I've never gone on a trip with my parents."</p> <p>"First, that's a first, but after lunch we'll take advantage of many of the opportunities while we're together. I like being with you."</p> <p>As he continued to feel as much as he ever had, he pulled off his robe and looked down at her naked body. He liked the way it felt on his body and he wanted to feel the same for her. Her slender but very aroused form showed him that she was enjoying the same experience he was. She seemed to be in a blissful state of mind as she continued to rub his cock.</p> <p>She smiled and leaned back onto the bed, her legs spread wide, her breasts jiggling lightly when she laid her head down. She looked as if she just had an orgasm as she smiled.</p> <p>"My parents will be worried if they see us together again. I love the pleasure I can get from masturbating for you."</p> <p>Her beautiful face lit up in anticipation as she held his erection and leaned forward to take him in her mouth.</p> <p>"Oh, God, yes! That feels so good!" she hissed while she began to rub the head of his cock back and forth with her tongue.</p> <p>She looked up at him once again and smiled, "That's better," she said.</p> <p>He looked down at her as she continued to rub his hardness while she licked his balls. She leaned forward again, her hand rubbing back and forth over his erection.</p> <p>"I can't believe you want me to do this," he said as his hands stroked behind her head.</p> <p>"You know I do. We're not going to be able to keep our hands off of each other. I love your hardness in my mouth. You're going to enjoy this too," she said as she pulled her mouth off of him.</p> <p>"What? I want us to do this and do it again, but this time, let me fuck you from behind when I fuck your ass?" he asked with a smile.</p> <p>"Oh, I can do that!" she said with a smile. "I could do it, too," she said and she grinned up at him as she straddled his hips.</p> <p>She looked over her shoulder as she sat on the bed and said "This is a first, I don't know how many I'll be able to get to when we're alone. I could really cum."</p> <p>He reached up and ran the ends of his fingers slowly down her spine. His fingers came down to her cheeks and then back up.</p> <p>"Please," he whispered to her.</p> <p>She smiled and reached under herself. She raised her body with her arms as she leaned forward. He could feel her soft skin on his hands as he began to rub her ass. He held the cheek firmly as he slid his middle finger into the crack between her ass and pussy. She let out a moan and said "Oh, that feels nice!" she smiled up at him.</p> <p>She slid forward and put her chest on his, pressing her breasts against his face as he began to rub her with his finger.</p> <p>She sat back on her hand as she moved forward and he felt his finger slide smoothly between her swollen pussy lips as he bent his middle finger and began to slide along her pussy.</p> <p>She let out a moan as he slid his finger into her tight hole and moved it around. He could feel her inner muscles tighten around his finger as he pressed into her, but not enough to push it into her body completely, but enough to stimulate. Her back would arch as he slid his finger around, then back down and over her clit.</p> <p>The sensation was indescribable. He could feel her body move with him as she rocked her crotch up and down his finger. He knew it was only a few seconds of teasing before she was going to cum.</p> <p>In that same moment he could feel the firstâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
