I felt the pre-cum coming. She leaned forward and pressed her breasts against me cupping her breasts in my hand as she pulled me into her with her mouth, I pressed into her as I pushed into her. With her lips tightly wrapped around the head of my cock, her tongue was swirling and sliding around me like a snake, and the pressure was building in my dick in ways that I had never experienced and the sight and feel of the head of my cock buried in her pussy as I pumped into her was like a tidal wave flowing into shore and into me. She was holding the tip of my cock in her and squeezing hard at the base of my foreskin where it was trapped inside her.</p> <p>This was making me wilder than I had ever been before.</p> <p>I pulled back a little, then pushed back in, we went at it like animals in the mating season.</p> <p>She just held me there for quite a while, then lifted one leg to the same position I was in. I was up against the back of her ass and I was holding on as she did, so I was pulling forward with all my might when I felt the lips at the end of my cock start rubbing against my opening which was beginning to open a little from the pressure. She was now holding me at the end of the corona of my swollen mushroom, and there was the tip of my cock inside the hot wet warmth of her pussy.</p> <p>I felt the hot dampness as it engulfed my aching to plunge cock into her as far as it would go. A second later and I was pumping up into her as hard as I could, my pubic bone slamming up into hers while she was pushing back at me as hard and as far as she was able. It must have looked like it really hurt me with her hips slapping against my ass but this wasn't hurting her, I was just giving her a good fucking. This was the first time I had ever thought that I would ever get my dick into her, that she would make me do this but here I was, giving her this pleasure even if it was a bit painful.</p> <p>My orgasm came upon me as I continued to pump into her.</p> <p>At the peak of my climax I pulled back hard enough so that the first blast of cum hit my belly, and some of the fluid began to run down out of her as she lifted herself slightly to try to impast herself again. I could feel the cum splatter against the underside of my cockhead. I held myself to her pussy and let the remainder of the ejaculation erupt in her until the spurting subsided. All the strength and concentration that I had learned to give into the lust that I had for her left me completely spent. She smiled up at me, and her face was wet with sweat, I was sure she was licking our juices from my stomach, and that it was all she could to keep us going but that I knew her mouth was dry.</p> <p>I turned off the water and the water heater and went into our cabin.</p> <p>"Is everything okay there?" she asked, holding me close.</p> <p>"I'll be fine." And I started to move toward the bathroom. "I have to find out if you want me to take a shower too," I said pulling back on her hair as I stepped out into the bedroom.</p> <p>"Okay!" she said. As I reached to open her bedroom door and close the door she was standing up with a shower running next to the bed, a towel wrapped around her body to just cover over her tits. She was standing between the bed and the bed and had just turned the shower off when I came in.</p> <p>"You okay?"</p> <p>"Yes, I'm not really sure if I want to, I can get up," she said. "We could if you are uncomfortable"</p> <p>"No, not at all," I said. "I'll be right back."</p> <p>When I came back into the bedroom I saw that the bathroom light was on. It was on but the bathroom light didn't glow, only cast shadows against the wall.</p> <p>"Can I have a word with you in the bathroom, first?"</p> <p>"Of course." I walked into the bathroom and looked into the mirror. She was standing up in the bathroom next to the bed. The robe had slipped off her shoulders, but she was naked as I could see her nipples poking up and straining toward the ceiling.</p> <p>My god, how I had grown and so had she, I looked down to make sure she was still wet and still wearing that damn stupid robe. I took her robe off over her shoulders and she was standing naked in the moonlight. It was my turn to look. "Is that how you wear one of those?" I asked.</p> <p>"Noâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
