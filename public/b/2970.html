He leaned in close and began to run his tongue up and down her length, taking it between his lips and sucking it into his mouth. His tongue worked its way back up to her hole and danced around the small puckered bud of her anus. It made her hips buck and he felt her begin to convulse before he slid a finger into her ass.</p> <p>"No!" she cried, "Please, no! I can't take any more!"</p> <p>"It's your turn now." he said in the same tone and took her back up to the shower stall. He stood her against the shower wall and lowered his mouth to hers.</p> <p>For the first time all summer she could think about was the pleasure they were both enjoying. It was as though he knew how it felt to be inside her and they could do whatever they liked, in what they had to, as was the way she had started thinking about it.</p> <p>She moaned as his tongue pressed hard against hers. Her pussy got wetter as his finger probed her ass and her orgasm rippled through her.</p> <p>He felt her legs shake as his face brushed hers and he knew it wouldn't be long until she came. He kissed her again and felt her arms wrap around him. He lifted her into the shower and rinsed her off. Her legs hung in the water. His cock hardened at the sight of her body. She turned and smiled up at him.</p> <p>"Oh my, you've got the cutest armpits," she said.</p> <p>"Thanks," he replied smiling then lowered his face to hers. He slowly slid three fingers into her pussy bringing them back out covered with his cum, "This is fantastic."</p> <p>"I don't know what you're waiting for, fuck me right here in the shower." she breathed as she turned and kissed him softly.</p> <p>Slowly he entered her pussy. She shivers began to shake. As he entered her again, her pussy enveloped his cock, as it had the first time they had fucked. It seemed to pulse and jerk in her pussy as his hard cock entered and out of her. He knew she was sensitive to pain on his part and his fingers were just good enough for her.</p> <p>"Are you okay?" he asked, concerned that he might hurt her as far as he had hurt her with the first two orgasms.</p> <p>"That was great. Oh, god, I've never been fucked like that before. I can feel every inch of you." she moaned as he began to fuck her.</p> <p>He loved to hear her talk like that and he began to increase his tempo, knowing she liked it as well. Soon he was pounding into her. The sound of his balls slapping against her ass could be heard every which way. Her head fell back and her body began to respond to every stroke.</p> <p>"Cum for me, baby," he groaned. "I want to feel your pussy convulse around my cock."</p> <p>"I can't, I'm so close...I'm going to cum again," she screamed. "I can't...please, make me cum! Make me cum!"</p> <p>His words were music to his ears. He knew he wanted to do that for her. He knew all her triggers were on and he knew she would never tell anyone and she might not tell a soul. He pulled her close and began to pound them both to orgasm after orgasm.</p> <p>"Oh God, fuck," she screamed as he finally finished and fell on top of her. They kissed as her pussy slowly released him.</p> <p>He rolled to the side then turned her around and kissed her gently. She wrapped her arms and legs tightly around him.</p> <p>"I'm going to miss you," she whispered. "You said you needed someone to be with."</p> <p>"I do. I'm sorry I hurt you." and he held her as she drifted off to sleep. She was a wreck and there was nothing she could say to relieve her. He drifted off to sleep too, but when he did something had changed as well.</p> <p>"Oh, my god," she whispered, "How'd you know that I liked anal sex?"</p> <p>"Yes. I love to give you butt-fuckings and you certainly liked it. I had the urge last night."</p> <p>She laughed then kissed him softly. "I feel so wicked," she said, "I guess I'll enjoy it again. I can't wait to get my cock back inside you."</p> <p>"Not so fast, sweetie. I'm not as ready as you just made me feel."</p> <p>He took her hand and they walked back to their bedrooms. He stopped to suck her toes then whispered in herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
