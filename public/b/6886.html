He said as they came out from the kitchen and the two girls walked up with him, "What's new?"</p> <p>She told him her life story and she thought that was pretty funny. He told them about his life going by a little girl that he was training to be his own personal cumslut. She said that after her first spanking she was so excited that she was masturbating right beside him. To her it was like a switch was turning on in her brain. "Momma, he is right. I have had some strange desires and needs like you don't know. Please don't beat me for a fool about anything." She told him.</p> <p>"I don't think I know enough about your needs to think that way, but if you are really into it you know I'll tell you if you want me to." He told her trying to ease the pressure of her hand.</p> <p>"I want it. Please teach me!" She begged of him.</p> <p>He looked at her for the longest time not knowing if he should really do it or not. She looked as if she were just about to explode.</p> <p>He decided to tease his little cumslut. He got the ball rolling a little and told her to stand up. He pulled her to him and lifted her around in the air, making love to her. She didn't know a man to do it like this. He knew he loved her and wanted to make her cum. She wasn't sure if this was her turn to make up for her feelings with his hands. As he kissed her he started to remove her panties.</p> <p>"We can't talk about doing this if we don't know each other well enough to know what it is. Please tell me what you are going to do to me when we are alone." She asked.</p> <p>He walked up to her face and kissed her. She tasted his lips. He held her there as he kissed her mouth and moved to her neck. He kissed her there to add to the sensation a little. Then he started moving his kisses down her back, kissing her buttock.</p> <p>"Don't move. I want it." He told her. He was really feeling the tension that he couldn't explain. He moved down in front of her again and began moving back up again. He kissed the front of her left thigh then his lips slid up the inside of her leg and to the inner thigh. He kissed the top of her pussy. He had to work hard not to touch her there. His mouth slowly circled her outer lips. He gently took each one between his lips and pulled it open and opened her, taking just the tip in until he kissed it and then he moved on to her outer lips. He did this several times and then he moved to the inner ones and slowly kissed each one.</p> <p>When he was done kissing her outer lips he used his tongue to play with them. He took both sides of them between his lips and sucked on them one at time. He then moved down to the lips and softly sucked on them. He could feel her body begin to relax under his lips. His mouth moved to her and he started on the outer part of her lips. He slid his tongue around her, feeling the moistness of her. She moaned as her body responded. He moved his tongue just below the part they were playing and began to explore her with it. He could barely get his tongue far out of his mouth and not taste her. He moved his tongue back down her wet area and made the small circles in her. He looked up and saw her eyes rolling back and her hands slowly moving up and down her sides. Her eyes had closed and she was enjoying his touch. She felt his tongue touch just the right place and her body was reacting to him. After a few seconds he moved higher and found her inner lips with a finger. He stroked her lips and began to kiss her there. The kiss deepened and her tongue was pushing up toward him. He could still taste her in his mouth even though she had sucked on his tongue. Her body reacted to him. "Yessssssss." She whimpered as she wrapped her arms around him and pulled him down for another kiss. He let her pull on him and felt his hard cock rub up against her belly. He felt a small amount of moistness between her legs. She could feel his hardness pressing into her again. She could feel every millimeter of him in her.</p> <p>She pulled him over and moved to the other side of the bed and laid him down on his stomach. Her hand had been working just behind his knees. His hands were resting at his sides and she pulled them off a little leaving his feet to move up and down. She ran her hands over his body starting from his feet to his belly and finally backâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
