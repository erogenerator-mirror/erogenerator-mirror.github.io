This is as fun!"</p> <p>With that, her mouth dropped to my now growing shaft and began to suck it in earnest. Her hand, her nails, were all over me as I lay there. The sound of her fingers in my pubes was almost drowned out by the steady wet sucking of her mouth. I could feel the tension building but it was more than that. Her breasts heaving, nipples now pouting to the touch of my hand, and her breathing became more forceful, as her body and mine tensed in unison, I warned her, "You better not come. I'll be right back."</p> <p>As she stood, towelled herself dry and brushed her hair with the hand towel she had draped over the chair, she slipped her bikini bottoms to the floor next to her purse. "I think you can wash that. It's ok, it's only natural for me to have come on your face." She kissed my lips and turned and headed back to the restroom. She had a towel around her waist from her top position and no top or bra. I followed. Once into the restroom, she handed me a handkerchief to dry her face. I wiped her face, trying to be as gentle as she had been with me, she had an unreadable face. She smiled, turned, and kissed me again, this time on the lips, and then said, "Don't worry darling. I am not going to bite you. At least not unless someone hurts you."</p> <p>I just smiled. "No baby, only someone who loves my big dick?" I finished and put my wet face back into the warm wetness she had left in her mouth as it slipped from my fingers. I took the towel and went over to the sink to wash it and rinse off my face. I had been standing there for a minute, just staring at her, not moving! I noticed she was still staring at me and smiling. I had not realized she had just walked out the door and had returned to her husband, her clothes still in her purse. I thought that she might have found a way to get them back.</p> <p>"Are you OK?" she asked as the smile returned to her face, "I thought you were going to be mad?"</p> <p>"No, I had no idea," I said smiling broadly, "I just never thought you would come after me like that. Are you OK baby?"</p> <p>"I was just so glad. I thought I would never be able to say the same. I had never been quite this happy, being able to be with you. It was a tremendous pleasure, I don't think I had ever felt so free and wonderful. It's been awhile since I have been with anyone. "</p> <p>She had gotten up and leaned against the vanity mirror beside the vanity to give me a long lingering kiss. "I have been thinking too. I don't want to say anything yet." Now, was definitely going to say something. "Do you have any wine?" I asked. What wine? I thought. I have been to many a long glass. I really needed some more wine to relax. I didn't have any in hand, so I turned from her and looked up at the mirror. Oh, shit, I thought suddenly looking again. I'm sure I looked very good. I was even having a small climax and knew I wouldn't be able to drive. I wondered if my wife would let any lady touch me like she did. And, of course, being with someone like her, would be very arousing. And, knowing her own husband, he never did me in a way that he wouldn't have me in the tub I was thinking that her husband never did.</p> <p>I walked over and kissed her softly on the cheek. I told her I missed her and to call me sometime. She laughed at the joke but was not really upset. We started off to get out of the bathroom. Once outside, she held my hand and pulled me to the kitchen table.</p> <p>"Would you be a dear and get me some wine for the ladies, please?" she asked me. "I think I could use something to relax."</p> <p>After taking my place, she made us both a tall glass, put the glasses down in front of us, and poured half from her glass and set it on the table near the two chairs to each side of the table. The chair was straight from the kitchen table. I think she said her husband had come back. It looked much more as if a kitchen chair was now part of the kitchen table. She went back to her seat and got a glass. As I sat down, I noticed she was looking at me and taking another sip and slowly taking it up and over her mouth. She set the glass down on the chair. She leaned toward me, kissed me hard once and then stood up.</p> <p>We wereâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
