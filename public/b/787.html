His cock was straining it's way up her body, and when she reached out and took it in her hand, he realized the same thing. Her hand wrapped around him, and as she ran her fingers down it, he could feel it begin to throb even larger. She moved it away for a moment, and then she slid it slowly down his shaft to the base, rubbing the tip over her clit as she did it, before leaning over him and taking the head between her lips. He could feel the warmth of her mouth around his dick, and that brought a moan of pleasure to him.</p> <p>She began to slide down the length of him, pulling her lips back up his length and then sliding down again. As she slid down again she held him deeply in her mouth, licking the head with her tongue making it wet with saliva, before slipping herself down fully onto him. He felt her warm lips around his shaft as she began to slide up and down along the length of him. He could feel the silky heat of her pussy through the thin fabric of her panties, and the softness of her legs around his thigh made him feel his whole being shift in place at the base of his neck. As it swelled and began to build up again it became a harder and harder as he began to thrust his hips upwards to meet her, meeting her every downward movement as she slid herself down his length, her back arching to try to angle his dick deeper inside of her. Suddenly she was moving up and down his dick again, but only at an up and down motion, and as he was feeling her pussy tighten around him he felt her hands sliding back up his chest, and her nails digging slightly into his skin. As he tried to take in a deep breath of oxygen, and realized he was gasping for air, he felt the weight of her breast against his chest, and the other against his cheek.</p> <p>She began to slide him in and out of her pussy faster and faster, her breath making short puffs as she brought her knees up against his sides, and leaned against it as she began to take his dick with short shallow strokes. He could feel the moist heat and slickness of her lips as they ran up and down the shaft of his dick, she could barely go even half way down on it, and each time she did she drew even further, making his dick go a little deeper inside of her. With each passing second his eyes were on her nipples pushing through her bra as she leaned forward, the more he could see of her nipples, the more he wanted.</p> <p>Her back arched as she drove herself on top of his cock, her hands slid back down his chest, and to the small of his back. She began to take more and more of his cock inside of her with each thrust, the slick pressure of her wetness as her walls encased him and she pulled him in.</p> <p>She continued to fuck him with long slow strokes as she looked down between them as she looked up at him, and smiled. Her hair hanging down across his face as she took a final deep breath of him, and began to slide her pussy back up his cock as she slid it back down.</p> <p>He felt her pussy tighten down about his dick and as her body shuddered to a stop, as her hot juices began to run out of her, and down his shaft, with her pussy gripping his dick like she had just been squeezed into vice, she took it from him and began to slowly pull herself up his dick until just the head was left inside of her, and only the slightest pressure released it. She let herself sink all the way down onto him slowly, sliding her pussy down his dick until he could feel her pussy against the head of his dick as it ran along his stomach, before she began to slowly slide the rest of him out of her pussy. Only the head still inside of her and she stopped. As she slipped back up his cock her eyes met his, and she smiled. He realized it didn't matter what she did, or did not do, he knew if she went back up he wouldn't stop fucking her.</p> <p>He reached for her, and she began to pull away, he could sense her hesitation, and she pulled back but only to quickly slide up again. Now he couldn't hold back any longer, he couldn't hold on any longer, and she felt it and knew it, so she threw herself down onto him and began to bounce up and down his dick like they had done many times the night before. He grabbed her ass, pulling her ass back towards him as he thrust himself up into her, and then down into her pussy again, so hardâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
