I like the feel of your smooth bare skin there." I kissed her ear lobe and started nibbling it gently, then moved my lips down to her ear and along her cheek. I then placed my lips on one side of her ear and nibbled it softly, then moved my mouth to her earlobe and did the same to it as I traced my kisses to her earlobe, which I softly kissed and swirled my tongue in it.</p> <p>"Mmm nice." I then moved my mouth to her ear and nibbled it lightly. She jumped slightly and her body shivered slightly. "Mmm." She said quietly, she didn't need to say anything, it seemed so natural to say anything.</p> <p>She slowly moved her arms down so her breasts were pressing onto my arm, her fingers playing in my hair. "Oh yes that feels good." She said softly. We didn't speak a word about having our arms in the way and were kissing lightly. Suddenly she moved her lips to my neck.</p> <p>"You feel so good in my arms." She said.</p> <p>I could hear her breathing as her heart rate kept racing even though I hadn't touched it with my lips yet. I moved down to her breasts, her nipple and moved my lips to it taking a moan of pleasure from her. She felt so good, so natural in my arms. I looked up at her eyes and saw a sexy smile. I took a nipple in my mouth and lightly sucked it. She pulled my head back.</p> <p>"Oh god baby your tongue is making me crazy." She said. Her voice was soft and sexy. I looked up at her. "Do you want to ride my face and doggy style?"</p> <p>Not waiting for an answer I started kissing down to her stomach. Her body jumped when my lips moved over the band of her panties. I slowly moved my lips up to her panties and kissed them. They didn't make a sound, just a light moan as my lips touched her panties. She felt so good, my tongue slowly moved it's way up and over her pussy, teasing her, taking my time, teasing her.</p> <p>"OH JIMY, PLEASE STOP" She said as she raised her hips up off the seat.</p> <p>I didn't stop, I just continued to slowly kiss and lick her pussy lips. "Mmm, I want to taste you." I looked up at her eyes as I moved my left hand to her right thigh while I continued to lick her. She moved her hips to give me more access.</p> <p>"OH JIMY" She whispered as I took my fingers, spread open the flesh of her pussy slowly. It spread and my tongue started to slide over her clit, slowly, making circles until I got to her love bud with the tip of my tongue. "OH JIMY" Her body shuddered with a slight tremor. It was my turn to smile.</p> <p>I flicked my tongue up the opening, making it as wet as could be. I moved it up and down the length of her love hole, feeling it, watching it, circling it, rubbing it with my tongue, sliding my hands into her hips, trying to find the right place. I wanted to make her cum, make her feel so good to me. I wanted a chance to make her feel so good, because I didn't know if I could. I pushed on her thighs trying to open them but just couldn't.</p> <p>"Oh god baby that feels amazing." Her voice was a little breathy. "Oh god... that's... feels good." She said as she held her hands to my head as she moved her hips up for a moment. She let go of her hands and just held me, holding me in place. I continued to run my tongue over her love hole, trying to find the spot where just the tip of my tongue was doing what it was designed to do, making her gasp. She was breathing hard.</p> <p>"OH JIMY... OHH HMMM I'M GONNA CUM JIMMY" She said as her body continued to move in circles trying to make herself cum. I started to go faster, getting to her clit. This was the spot I had been waiting to work on. I circled it, sliding my tongue over it as fast as I could. It was like electricity. It was a pleasure that I had never felt before. I wanted to make her cum, to own the feeling. "OH JIMY... I'M CUMMING" I heard her.</p> <p>As hard as I could I moved my lips up to hers, kissing her mouth as it just opened, as I kissed her I took my left hand, rubbed my thumb along her lips. I moved it to her clit as I continued to massage itâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
