They then had their customary drink after the round of small talk had ended when the conversation turned to the most amazing thing that had ever happened to them. It took a second or two before they could see any change coming; it was as if they saw some sort of cosmic connection within their own body. The three of them shared a warm kiss as they sat in the darkness talking and laughing, when a shadow appeared on the bed. It grew in size and became a large and dark person. It was clear before the two people reached the bottom of the bed, that they were not alone. The shadows grew even darker. It became impossible to say anything with the darkness within the room surrounding them that they could not see.</p> <p>"You are going to get raped by this monster," the shadow said in no uncertain terms as it began to slowly pull aside the sheet covering them.</p> <p>The person in the dark was much taller than the person on the bed beside them - possibly five foot five, as were the tentacles that were slowly closing about the person's body. It moved a little towards them, slowly opening the door a little more so that the body was now in front of them. He leaned forward and whispered something in the shadow's ears that didn't sound human. It quickly leaned back into its hiding place, hiding itself behind it's mouth. A few moments passed before the shadows reappeared from their hiding spot. The darkness looked so strange as the person on the bed lay completely on the other side of it, so that the body of the person was only inches from its chest. Their eyes, which had never left their former faces in any event, were now closed. The tentacles that were holding them in place pulled out. They slowly wrapped around the arms of the person on the bed, and slowly began to slide down their skin, and down on their back. It was like a large snake, with the arms behind it's torso and torso. The one below was just as large, maybe seven inches in length. The tentacle that was on the person below began to wrap around his legs, and slowly, gently, slipped between them, causing the tentacles to slide all the way out of the way. The other tentacles, the ones on the person beneath, began to slowly, tentatively, gently work their way around their bodies - each tentacle coming down towards a new tentacle at a time, one tentacle sliding slowly up his body, sliding past his pubes, and up his stomach to his chest to his abdomen and back down again, and tentacle up the front up to his lips.</p> <p>The person on the bed was now lying on his back, with his legs wrapped around the person from a slightly bent position. As one tentacle slid up one of his legs, it was still wrapped around his knee. They had done this a few times before in the past, but it was different with this one, the one on his crotch which had been in the dark. The two tentacles that had come up his legs slowly crept up his chest, and finally, as they reached the bottom of his torso, they began to brush the skin on his right nipple with their tip. The other tentacle, which was curled slightly around the mouth of the person below, slowly slid along his skin until it was resting behind the head of his dick.</p> <p>At that point, one tentacle slipped up the man's mouth, and the other tentacle slid in. As each of the tentacle slid up the man's shaft, the tips of two of the fingers of one hand began to glide in and out of the man's ass, with his fingers sliding easily up and down the man's cock. The fingers began to work it's way in and out of the man's ass, moving them slowly and with a slight forward and back motion. The tentacle on the person below was moving a little faster as it began to build it's speed. It was not as fast as the one on the guy in the middle, however as the tip of the tentacle on his dick pressed up against the man's prostate, the orgasm started to take hold of him. The man's moans were almost a chorus of pleasure as the tentacle between his legs began to speed up. The person under him had started to pump up and down his dick a little faster, and was making the sounds of both the person on his back as well as being fucked from both sides.</p> <p>The climax seemed to be coming over him for an eternity. It was so long that the man himself just couldn't tell which was the strongest, which was the strongest. Eventually the entire body seemed to go numb.</p> <p>The other tentacle that was still in between his legs began to slide up his chest.
