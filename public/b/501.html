"I just need to get a look around."</p> <p>He checked out all the other rooms in the house. With the exception of the small bedroom where he had left his things, it looked like several rooms from which he might need one. The only problem he had was he didn't think that would be a problem if he got lost somewhere else and he had an extra bathroom to use. A quick trip to a second bedroom that was bigger and more elaborate than his had told him, along with two suitcases, the whole package was worth several thousand dollars.</p> <p>Taking her hand in his, Jack led her over to the door. "We'll just do this the hard way and then come out once we're done." He closed the door as he took her hand the keys, turned her around and they left his condo.</p> <p>"Thank you so much, Jack," she said as they strolled through the doorway.</p> <p>"No-no, not a problem," he called back with a smile. "No problem at all. I'll pay you for the ride."</p> <p>He held out her hand and she took it. "No, no trouble." She walked with him to the front door.</p> <p>With the car in park, Jack got out and opened the door for her. She came and went with his smile, but Jack didn't do it with words. He kissed her on her left cheek while he checked out his surroundings. "This is what I'll do, Mrs. C. I really don't have much choice but to buy it now, and I'll be glad to do it for you."</p> <p>"Mmmm, maybe a little," she said as her own smile returned. "If you buy me one as well, we could have a whole weekend."</p> <p>"No, that can't be true," he said. "This weekend might be special to all of us but I'm not sure that we're ever going to see you again."</p> <p>He watched as she looked around. "It's good to know that I can walk outside with you," she said. "But we can't go much farther when you're driving. We should probably get a motel room. You and my father are never going to drive together again."</p> <p>Jack nodded and gave her hand a friendly squeeze. "No, I won't buy you a motel room."</p> <p>"Oh, right," she said, grinning. "I thought we were going to be alone."</p> <p>He chuckled. "We'll take it easy and get a room together," he said, as he took her hand again. "I like watching you smile."</p> <p>"Good! I didn't have a chance today to change my plans about what I should do. I need to get used to having you in my life."</p> <p>"Hmmm," he said. "You're my life, too?"</p> <p>"Yes, and, like I said, I like to do everything with you and in order to have it happen for us."</p> <p>He smiled and gave her a soft kiss on her lips. "We will be seeing each other again in the fall." He kissed her again, and let go of her hand as he opened the door for her.</p> <p>"I really enjoyed today. This is what you told me you were going to do," she said to him as she slid into the limo, with its windows open. She looked out the limo window to his face. Her smile was fading as she remembered how close they had come to falling together. "This is where we're going to spend my summer," she said to herself.</p> <p>Jack smiled. "Are you kidding? I just can't get over this place." He pulled her into his arms and wrapped his arms around her in a big hug. "I feel a great deal better now, you know." He looked out to see his father's smiling face as he drove them to the motel. As they got close, he pressed his nose hard against hers.</p> <p>"I don't know what to say to that." She took his face in her hands and pressed it against her cheek.</p> <p>"This is great," he said. "I haven't had the better one in years."</p> <p>He looked at the car and thought of the days before him and how many times he would have had it. Now he would be able to live with it, and maybe even enjoy his retirement the first time he knew of it, if he ever wanted. "Yes, I think you're right," he said. "I guess I'll definitely keep you. If I can at least call you and let you know. There's still time to spend with you. We'll have time to get to know eachâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
