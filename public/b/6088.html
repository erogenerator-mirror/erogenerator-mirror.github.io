I opened my eyes to see her smiling at me, her beautiful face. I lay her down gently, kissing her, running my tongue across her jaw and cheek. I kissed down her throat and to her ear, where I nibbled her ear gently. I kissed down her neck to the top of her tank top, and licked a strip of her flesh as my tongue slid down the center of her chest, licking around the top of her breasts before licking back up the top of her bra. I began to caress her breasts when I found her nipples poking through her bra. With soft fingertips, I stroked them to the point of pain. She moaned and wriggled underneath me. A hand stroked my neck and began to unbutton my shirt. I leaned down to kiss her breast, and she pushed my head away. She laid back, smiling, and opened her eyes. I kissed down her stomach, and stopped at the hem of her pink shorts. I ran my hands down her soft thighs, leaving a trail of fire across her thighs as I neared her pussy. She parted her legs, and I could just make out her lips through the sheer fabric of her panties.</p> <p>I kissed lower, and her hands were massaging her own breasts, her own fingers running through the hair on the back of my head. I kissed down the middle of her pussy, and her hands clenched my shirt as I continued. She was clearly dripping. When my tongue brushed against her clit, she squirmed. She was making little whimpering noises, and I worked my tongue slowly with the tip, slowly bringing her to a peak. After the third stroke, her hips pushed up, trying to meet my tongue. And then she was cumming, bucking her hips up to meet my face, crying out in pure pleasure. She finally calmed down, and I pulled away. I stood up, turned around slowly and hugged her to my chest. Her arms went around my neck. I kissed the top of her head. She pulled away, and pulled on my shirt, pulling it over my head, not bothering to remove it, as she sat with her legs spread, fingers running through her pussy. She began to play with her breasts as she looked at me. With a smile, she said, "I liked watching you last night, Ryan."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I've had my eyes fixed on you since I got here. I was wondering if you were here watching me, and that made me want to stop."</p> <p>"I didn't want to do anything," I said. "I just couldn't pass my eyes up at a woman." "Well, you're doing great." She kissed my lips, and ran her hand through my hair.</p> <p>"I can't think of anything else than watching you fuck my brains out, though," I said, and kissed her. She ran her hands through my hair. We made out for about an hour, until the two women in the next room started getting suspicious again. And this time they were naked. But when I saw the two naked men watching us play with each other, I got up and walked out. The man was in a stall, his girlfriend at home, with the other two. I went to the door, not bothering to stop. When I got to the stall door, the guy got up, pulled his girlfriend into the darkness. They kissed, he ran his hands all over hers, they got naked. I watched as, for a second, I just stood there and gawked. My girlfriend was kissing him, rubbing her hands down his naked torso, down to his cock. And then he pulled her away.</p> <p>"Ryan, please?" I heard her say, and there appeared to be an intense look of panic in her eyes. You know a man can look at a pretty girl, can't he? But look at me, I've got an erection.</p> <p>"You scared the hell out of me, but I'm not gay," he said.</p> <p>"Why do you need to be so fucking gay?" I ask her.</p> <p>"Because I don't want that boy looking down my shirt at me," she said in a whisper. She looked at me, searching my eyes. She was scared. She wasn't in a vulnerable position. And then she smiled at me with her beautiful blue eyes. No one would ever look on with such cold, so I leaned down and kissed it. I licked it, feeling the skin on my mouth against her tongue. For a minute, I looked at her, then leaned down and kissed the tip of her tongue, then leaned down again, running her tongue along the underside of my cock, feeling it pulse in her. She felt my hardness, and gave in, pushing me back slightly. She pushed me inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
