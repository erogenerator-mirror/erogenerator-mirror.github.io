Oh God. That's lovely. Please don't stop. Keep going. I've never been touched by anything in my life. Oh my god."</p> <p>My orgasm was massive. Never had I reached that level in my life. As she lay on top me with my now shrinking cock in her hands I started to move again. She just held and pushed me until I was at the point of no return, then she stood, straddling me and started to guide my shaft into her. Once I was she positioned the head at her opening and quickly slid all the way down on to me. This made all the difference. She began a slow, steady motion with my cock which had me thinking this wasn't my first time and the feeling was fantastic.</p> <p>When I thought my cock was all the way in it was feeling wonderful again, and so was I. When she started to push herself up, the feel of her weight on me with my fully soft cock in her hand was indescribable, more than enough to drive me insane. She sat down on me, slowly, and held it there for a minute, her breath coming hard and fast.</p> <p>"No stop. Oh god, yes. Oh yes."</p> <p>She ground her hips and I could feel her body quivering. "Oh yes. Oh god."</p> <p>She leaned forward and her hands started to push the base of my shaft with her pelvis, while my hands remained planted on her ass. At the same time, her head was tilted back.</p> <p>"Oh yeah. I love that."</p> <p>My lips were now sealed around hers. I could feel my cum rising again, this time in streams, until, with a deep growl, my cock exploded a long ribbon of cum inside her. As before, when she came, the feelings were intense, as though her body was on fire, and the pleasure was simply tremendous.</p> <p>"A-A-A-Oh God. Oh thank you."</p> <p>When she was finished she turned around and kissed me.</p> <p>"Mmm, thank you, you wonderful lover."</p> <p>We then lay there, on the bed, naked, until we both drifted off to sleep. I was the first to wake.</p> <p>"Don't move. I have something I want to show you."</p> <p>I moved the duvelette off the end of the bed and turned her over, and had her lay down on her front.</p> <p>"Right, open your eyes. Your body's still there. Are you OK?"</p> <p>"I just feel amazing. I have never felt anything like that," she assured me.</p> <p>I put the pad under one of her breasts and brought the other to my mouth. Slowly, softly, I licked and suckled. As I licked I gently squeezed the other breast to the side, the nipple being sucked very hard.</p> <p>"So, you ready to show me how you feel about your body?"</p> <p>"Oh yes. I want to see if I can make you feel like I'm making you feel."</p> <p>"Show me how good you make me feel, my lover."</p> <p>I pulled my body down over hers and slipped out of the covers, which were now spread, to sit on her. As I was about three inches from her face I whispered, "Let's make love. We will make love and explore my body."</p> <p>That sent her on her merry way again. In a very soft voice she said, "Oh, my, that's nice. Did you make love to someone?"</p> <p>"Many," I replied. "Many times."</p> <p>"Some other times? Wow, what a turn on to have those feelings? Have you made up your mind?"</p> <p>I hesitated. "Well I just want to try."</p> <p>She reached between us and grabbed my cock, and started to rub it around her. "Well, maybe you can have me here for myself."</p> <p>"Yes, now you can use something else in there and I will help you. "</p> <p>With that, she placed her lips around me and started the head. I was about the same, but she knew exactly where and how to put it in to make sure.</p> <p>After a minute she was satisfied with the way I was.</p> <p>"Mmm, that's nice. Now, you can show me how to make love."</p> <p>"Right, but you need to be still."</p> <p>As if she could read my mind, and I had no trouble thinking of what to do with my hands I had my thumbs rubbing the length of her pussy. When I was satisfied that she was as aroused as I was she started to work up to the top of her body. Her back was to me and I slid my thumb down to her ass crack which she started to relax, and I found, indeed, quiteâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
