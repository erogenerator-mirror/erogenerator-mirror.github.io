I whispered, my head nodding up and down from his neck to his collarbone, and then to his lips.</p> <p>"Any time you get up," he whispered back.</p> <p>I opened my mouth and moved my tongue over his lips, which were warm, and slightly parted, before sucking gently on his lower lip.</p> <p>"Come in here, Tom," I heard him say, and my heart fluttering, as I reached over to the nightstand and brought him a coffee mug.</p> <p>He sat up, leaning back with a grin on his face, and took out the condom I had given him a few days before. "There!" he said, and handed it to me, as if he was offering me a cup of coffee.</p> <p>"How do you want it, Tom?" I asked, as I put the condom on, and took out my own.</p> <p>"It's on the house," he said as he handed me the condom, a little more casually than I planned.</p> <p>"Oh, the same thing as it usually is," I said, and then I handed the condom to him and we took a seat in the kitchen together for our coffee.</p> <p>We were just talking and staring at each other for a minute, and I felt comfortable with him. He was obviously as handsome as I had imagined after all these years of watching my ex-boyfriends. He had a lovely smile and the kind of eyes that looked at you like you were a prize, with little fangs and sharp white ones, and had the bluest eyes I had ever seen. His hair was jet black and curly around his temples, and his skin was like silk, like silk on a hot day in summer, and his eyes were like ice, which had always seemed to have ice-balls on the surface.</p> <p>"What shall I do for you?" I asked, and he smiled and shook his head in a gesture of agreement.</p> <p>"I'd like to feel that cock inside me," he said, and I could see the smile that made its way up his cheekbones while he looked at me. "But first, if you really want to, I'm here," he said, as he rose from the couch, and opened the refrigerator, and pulled out a bottle of brandy, and began pouring a generous amount of the stuff in the glass.</p> <p>I stood up from the dining room table and walked over to where he was sitting and gave him a small, gentle, and meaningful look.</p> <p>"And I want you to drink it as well, and make no mistakes."</p> <p>As he put his glass of brandy on the table, he leaned back to kiss me again. I kissed him, and he opened his mouth to meet mine, and our tongues entwined, and we tasted each other, and we held hands and stroked each other. He opened the box of chocolates I had given him a few weeks before, and put them on a small tray.</p> <p>"I'm going to make a few calls, and maybe go over a few things first," I said, as we finished our drinks.</p> <p>"It might be a few minutes before I can finish my calls," I said, and I could see him smiling at that, as he was a little embarrassed.</p> <p>After I finished my calls with him the way I was, I put a cigarette between my lips and lit it. I couldn't take my eyes off him, and I was really getting horny. I watched him, as he took a drag on the cigarette and looked at me over his glasses, and then he took his hand from the cigarette and brought it to his mouth, to the same lips, and kissed me deeply.</p> <p>"I'll see you at your office, in two minutes," he said, and took a seat on a chair across from me, and I stood up and walked to his door.</p> <p>"Tom, is there anything else you can get me?" I asked, as I stood there waiting for him to open the door.</p> <p>"Yes," he replied, "and let me see the phone again, when I'm home from work tomorrow."</p> <p>"Oh," I said, and I looked at the screen at his side, and then looked up at him, and he was looking at me.</p> <p>"Tell me."</p> <p>He didn't reply as he took the phone from me.</p> <p>"I'm about to be, on top of him," he said, and he held up one finger and I just nodded, and I heard his cell dialing. "Hi Mr. Adams. This has been difficult, I thought I would call about what happened, what happened to us, but I really have not found a way out," he said, and he looked up at me.
