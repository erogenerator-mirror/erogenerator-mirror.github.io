I'm just working on this place," the girl said, looking at the ceiling.</p> <p>"No problem," I told her, "we all love you!" I said, adding more details.</p> <p>The girl said "Thanks" as she put on a coat, trying to look presentable.</p> <p>We set off back to the cabin, to get the truck unloaded as much as possible, but she was really getting tired. Her coat was hanging open, and she rubbed her arms and shoulders as we drove. She was sitting on my lap, facing me, as we were driving to the site.</p> <p>"What are we going to be doing when we get there?", I asked, rubbing her back through her sweater.</p> <p>"I think so, but I think we should make sure to leave our boots on" she said.</p> <p>The truck and truck driver both started to get a laugh at us.</p> <p>I said "Look at this," as I grabbed the boots with the other hand, causing her to stop in the middle.</p> <p>She looked up as I opened my hands and took the boots from my hands. She put them right next to each other on the truck bed, and we started moving. I knew that I had my boots in front, with my legs spread, and that she could see my cock, but the truck driver had a good view of what was happening.</p> <p>"Why don't we stay right there?", I told her.</p> <p>I pulled the blanket right back over our boots. She was leaning back into me from the front, as we rode back. There were more blankets scattered out along the road. Her body was warm and soft as she laid there. I grabbed her right ankle, pulling it up, and off my lap, letting it slip off the edge. Then I slid my hands around her, and she grabbed my hand. We were standing next to each other, with our legs and arms pressed together. She pushed my hand away with her own.</p> <p>"We'll be done in a few minutes.", she said.</p> <p>I was relieved to hear that she was going to leave her right leg, so I pulled the blanket out of the way. I was hoping to get my hands on her foot before she had opened herself to me. I was pleased in an unspoken way that my fingers were now able to pass by her stocking-less knee, and slip up to the top of her thigh.</p> <p>"This is my most sensitive spot.. you're making me wet in bed!", I said, as I lifted her leg up over my shoulders. She leaned down and kissed me passionately. She had a strong grip around my neck, and I felt her hand rubbing my chest. Her other hand was rubbing my thigh, and my cock was now poking out from underneath my pants (that was what we were doing). I felt like we were making out for a long time, and I was really enjoying it. I wanted to touch her bare skin, but I decided I should let her have it.</p> <p>"Where were we?", she asked, as she pulled me up, and kissed me again. Then she started kissing my neck and ear.</p> <p>"We've been here, and we're not even out of the woods!", she whispered.</p> <p>She kissed her way down my neck, and started licking around my chest, and licking against my nipples.</p> <p>"You didn't answer", she said as she kissed further down my body. She pushed me backwards and climbed up onto the truck bed, as I sat on the corner with a seat behind, and a blanket over the back. I leaned back a bit and spread my legs apart, giving her a good view of my dick.</p> <p>"Is it that big?", she asked rhetorically as she slid her pants down, revealing her shaved pussy. It was slightly swollen and wet.</p> <p>"No", I stammered in response as I pulled my pants down to expose my half-hard dick.</p> <p>She ran a hand along my abs, and down to my balls. She held my cock tightly, like she did my dick earlier, and gave several long strokes before releasing it to rub over her wet pussy lips.</p> <p>"I thought that would be uncomfortable", I whispered back to her.</p> <p>She lowered her head between my legs, and sucked my cock in her hand once more. I'm sure that she had noticed that I had a larger than average head, and that it had leaked a little pre-cum, making it easier to get into her mouth.</p> <p>"Are you OK", she asked again.</p> <p>"No", I managed, as she moved her hair out of her face, and her mouthâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
