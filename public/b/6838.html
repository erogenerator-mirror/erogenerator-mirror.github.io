"They don't have to say it. The girls and I need to be clear..." He shook his head slowly and shook his head at his wife, "They are just worried about us."</p> <p>"Oh well," she said softly. "Maybe we have to move on then."</p> <p>"Perhaps so," he said. "I will wait until after our vacation and then we can tell them we are all right." A soft knock on the door brought him to reality. He looked down to see his wife stood beside him. He said nothing as she walked away and looked up the stairs to the balcony door.</p> <p>"Hi!" she said in a whisper. "You are the sexiest man I have ever met! And my husband is right there," she added in a softer tone. He felt warm inside and it made him feel good to be naked and to have her touching him again. He had the urge to just take her and be with her again. He thought. She just doesn't seem to understand how he feels. He looked to her as if she would just tell him that she didn't think it was the right thing to do. He tried to move his arms and she stopped him.</p> <p>"No," she said. "I am a married woman. I really have no idea what makes me such a good lover for you. Let's go to our room."</p> <p>"Ok," he said as he followed her to the room and sat on the bed. It was a smallish room and he knew it wouldn't be much. If they got comfortable, he really would like to see her naked again. They had already fooled around and so he couldn't tell what to expect. They did go to the balcony and saw them standing at the door.</p> <p>"What's going on?" the stranger said nervously. A large man with thick goatee and deep brown eyes was standing next to him.</p> <p>"It's a surprise," he said looking at Mark. "Can I help you."</p> <p>The stranger was about the same size as Mark and he was looking at the same woman from the side of the bed as he spoke to the stranger. He had his right arm over his eyes and his left arm around the stranger's shoulders. The stranger looked down at Mark and saw her hand moving on the guy's shoulder and her thumb moving across his stubble covered chin. They were holding hands with a hand around each other's neck. He felt hot and strong with the look on his face but didn't care. Just his eyes. There was something in those big hazel eyes. It didn't register that this stranger was actually Mark but it had to be because she had the same hazel eyes.</p> <p>"Well," the man said nervously. "We are in room 6." He looked to the stranger.</p> <p>"Yes, we are in room 6." The stranger looked at him.</p> <p>"I will be right back. If you have a minute."</p> <p>"Of course," the stranger said. He turned and left the room as Mark turned his back to the pair and took his hand from her shoulder.</p> <p>"Wow!" she said as she closed and locked the door.</p> <p>"I didn't realize it would be so sudden."</p> <p>"I thought it was because your clothes were so tight when I had them on!" she said. She had that smug smile again and that look in her eye. She wasn't laughing anymore. She really did love her husband and wanted to have sex with him. This guy was just so hot. Their sex life had been so bland all these years. Now they had gotten a chance to make it right.</p> <p>"I think my zipper might be coming up," Mark said while staring at the two women.</p> <p>"If you want my hand," Mark said. "It'll be my turn to move tonight." His wife moved over to her husband and they stood holding hands.</p> <p>"I think she likes you," Mark said as he ran his finger across the stranger's jaw.</p> <p>"I think she does too," the stranger said leaning down. The two of them kissed gently and held each other's hands. Mark felt the warmth of the strangers hands on his body and felt like a million bucks. He had been alone ever since Christmas and now, he was going to find out how his wife and he had gotten to know each other.</p> <p>"I will see you then," the stranger said and he got up from the bed and walked away. Mark turned around and looked at his wife sitting on the bed and feeling a shiver run down her body.</p> <p>"I hope the two of you were ready for more than just a blow job earlier," she said grinning. Mark could feel himself getting wet.</p> <p>"I donâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
