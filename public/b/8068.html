"I just want to give it a shot."</p> <p>"How so?" she asked as her lips met his again, this time his tongue probed into her mouth and pulled it inside.</p> <p>"Come now, I know you want it." he smiled.</p> <p>"How so?" she breathed as he kissed her again before backing away while his hands explored her body again.</p> <p>"Let me go." she said as he moved her toward the door and out of the pool area.</p> <p>"And where will you go?" he asked after he unlocked the door and let her in.</p> <p>"I'll go take a shower."</p> <p>She didn't wait after he took her into it, she stripped off his swim trunks and climbed in the spa tub, turning on some hot water in the hot tub until the jets came on the tub.</p> <p>"Now why don't we see how quickly the showers are." he said as he climbed in after her.</p> <p>"Okay." she said, her smile and the thought of a hot shower added a sparkle to her look of happiness. "It would be fun." she said, leaning back on his chest.</p> <p>"I have a better lock on the door." he moaned as he reached up and pressed his lips to hers again.</p> <p>"So would you..." she laughed as his hands slid over her breasts while they kissed.</p> <p>"You bet. You better let me know when you can't handle it." he told her as his mouth left her. "I'll be in the house to watch your reaction."</p> <p>She could hear him rustling around downstairs before her mind cleared. The hot tub quickly filled up with water and water dripped off their bodies as they kissed and rubbed their bodies as they came down.</p> <p>Sinking back on the bed and closing his eyes, Ian let the hot water flow over his body before he kissed her again and slid his body under hers into the water as he slid his hands between her legs.</p> <p>"And how's that?" he asked as he slid them under the water.</p> <p>"Well, you don't have to stop... right now." she told him.</p> <p>"Okay." he agreed as he slid the soap off her long dark hair. She spread her legs as he ran his hands down her body, loving the feel of their bodies together.</p> <p>"I'm just warming up." she smiled. "But it's okay."</p> <p>"Oh yeah?" he grinned as he rubbed the soap between her legs. "Doesn't matter what happens between us... just do it."</p> <p>"Can... can we...." she managed as Ian took her hand and slid it under the cold water between him and his body. He took hold of her hand and raised it to his mouth to kiss it.</p> <p>Releasing her hand, Ian ran his body down hers with his own as the water flowed in between their bodies. His hard manhood soon found his way between her legs and started to rub up and down as he kissed down her neck and onto her cleavage. Her hands stroked his back as their bodies rubbed against each other.</p> <p>Sliding down her body he finally found his way onto his knees between her thighs, their eyes never leaving each other as the water flowed between them and down Ian's own body while he leaned up over hers as he grabbed her legs to keep them spread. Her mouth fell open, her breaths coming in ragged gasps as she watched his hard body move between hers.</p> <p>"Oh yeah." Ian moaned as he leaned down to meet hers. As he slipped out from under her legs, he slid up her legs until the water hit his face and his face was over her chest as he kissed her breasts.</p> <p>Kissing her hard nipples, Ian lifted his right hand to slap her right breast as he ran his right hand along her left thigh, leaving a trail while he slid his hand down her body to her hot, wet pussy.</p> <p>"OH FUCK!" she moaned as he slide his wet fingers across her hard clit. "I want you!" she practically hissed.</p> <p>"You don't have to get off just yet." he said as he leaned down to kiss her and then slid down so their mouths were just inches apart.</p> <p>He slid his fingers back and entered her with his tongueâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
