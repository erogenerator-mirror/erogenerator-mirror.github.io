There was no hurry, but eventually I made the trip to work out again.</p> <p>Once all of the new hires were on board I told them to come on board; we had to show them a little skin.</p> <p>I explained the process, including how to handle some of the extra responsibility, and how it meant that we would be on display almost every single day from the beginning and end. I also let them feel free to express themselves as much as they liked to express themselves. In my experience there were other employees that really got off on showing off their bodies.</p> <p>I got used to the idea of men being able to take on even a full sized woman in one day. It made me feel good and confident; even though the women would just stare at me the entire time, and I sure as hell could feel their eyes.</p> <p>As the first day ended I was still in good mental mood; not to mention a certain degree of confidence. I kept myself busy and ready for work in the morning. I was ready for a good workout, so I called in my fitness instructor to get the help. At first he was concerned that I wasn't ready for a workout. I got a little worked up when I came in and sat down for lunch. I don't do the work at the gym, I'm a dancer. After lunch I was hoping that he would make his first move, but he simply refused to speak. He left to get his workout kit for me while I was working out. I think he was starting to feel bad because he didn't seem to care that I was in love with him.</p> <p>Two weeks went by and things got slowly but surely better for me.</p> <p>At three I was ready to run, and I was starting to look forward to my workout. At one point I got up and walked over to my locker. The second time I had showered I decided to wear my new workout gear. It was a pair of very tight fitting gym shorts I had purchased for my first day in town. I put on a couple of the loose fitting gym socks that I had in my locker and left my gym bag at home. The whole outfit consisted of a simple pair of gray spandex athletic shorts.</p> <p>I checked myself in the mirror as I walked in. I was still surprised by how my body and body had changed in those shorts. My new body was trim and sexy, and all the girls at work noticed, but with my new size, I don't think some of them actually noticed. That, and a new confidence boost to my sex appeal that I was starting to get.</p> <p>Not long after, I was ready to move on.</p> <p>The next night I was ready to do another workout for my new workout partner. I started out at one of the cardio machines in the locker area. With everyone watching I would do an extra set that I knew that a man could only do in a gym once a week, and that I could only use it once every so often and only for men. I was always able to use the machine for the last hour or so, and I could get a couple hours off a week in a week at a speed where nothing ever felt so great.</p> <p>One of the guys I had seen working out the gym all summer was there and the idea of taking an extra hour of hard work on the table had me looking forward to doing it again.</p> <p>As I put on the exercise shorts I was starting to feel that feeling that all men can get, even if it's never felt so great. I felt myself getting excited as I watched the other women go about their work in their little gym. I never felt like I was going to stop watching her work out and start to be in tune with my thoughts and desires.</p> <p>On the third day I was back at the machine. The guys had their backs to me, and I could tell that they were looking over at me, but I didn't comment or look directly away from them. I didn't even bother to turn around until I could tell I had made time to be alone.</p> <p>As the week dragged by I was still trying to get into some new ground that I hadn't felt in almost a month, but this night I did feel some things that never felt so good. I really began to enjoy myself. The feeling I had was almost more erotic now that I had done some of the work.</p> <p>On the fourth day I was ready to go as I began my third set. The first half was done quickly. About thirty minutes into the set, I was ready for another round.</p> <p>It did seem that I was out of time to get back to the workout. I took a break and let myself in the room. I closed the door to the door, and closed my briefcase. All of the lights were turned off, except one with the emergency lights onâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
