"I live above where my Grandfather lived when he died. It has a great view from over there!" she finished and then added, "And it's got a terrific swimming pool! I was a very good swimmer back in the day." She smiled at what she was about to say.</p> <p>"Yeah, I saw a lot of old swimming pool back in the day," he said. "It's like an old fashioned swimming pool!"</p> <p>"Why did you retire early so early?" she asked.</p> <p>"We didn't have any time for ourselves," he replied.</p> <p>"But I've grown older and wiser!" she added. It was getting dark now, the stars were out and everyone was already awake but the night had turned chilly and there was still a chill to befall. "You're so quiet," she said as she turned her attention back to him. "I'm going to take a shower! I'll be right out! Don't get too close yet!" She walked off into the bathroom, leaving him feeling rather alone again. He heard the water start running as she turned on the shower before grabbing a towel and wrapping it around her, then heading back into the room. It seemed quite a long time since he'd heard a sound. He decided that he'd just stay in the kitchen for a while so he made a few breakfast and cleaned up while they ate. He didn't feel well so he went back to his room and crashed out in his bed and fell asleep.</p> <p>She emerged from the bathroom wearing a towel when he came into the room. She came over and kissed him softly, reaching up and lightly squeezing his semi-erect cock and balls.</p> <p>"I just wanted to feel you," she said and kissed him again.</p> <p>"Is that so?" he said, smiling widely. He could just make out a bit of dried semen on her tongue and lip and a dark spot in the front of her towel where he could just faintly see dried hair. He smiled at her playfully and she ran her hand through his pubic hair.</p> <p>"Mmm, so nice and curly and soft," she softly mumbled.</p> <p>"I wouldn't have thought you looked good this morning," he whispered. "What were your thoughts about the movie this morning?" she whispered back and then gently kissed his lips again, this time with more urgency. "Did you enjoy it?" she asked him.</p> <p>"Oh yes, I had a wonderful time!"</p> <p>"Good! I'm glad!" she said as her hand began massaging his erect cock through the towel. "I could just stare all day and then when the lights went down, I just lay back and enjoyed the experience!"</p> <p>They lay there for a little while longer, each exploring the other's body, occasionally taking the opportunity to kiss each other. Finally she broke the silence and whispered, "Can you go outside and put some sheets on the bed, please?"</p> <p>"I guess so," he whispered back.</p> <p>She got up from her bed and went down to the kitchen and began making some coffee. She came back to the bedroom a few minutes later and stood in the doorway and looked at him with a smile. "Good morning!" she said to him and then looked down at herself, which caused an image of her with her legs spread before her. She stood there for a moment or two looking at herself for several minutes. Finally, she looked him deeply in the eyes and returned to her bedroom.</p> <p>Once he was out of sight, he put on the sheets he had brought and then went down to the kitchen, where he got some eggs out of the fridge, then put some coffee on as well. He brought out a pitcher of jam and two slices of fruit, got some toast and a biscotti and a slice of each of his favorite foods from a drawer in his fridge. He ate breakfast off of the tray and then went out to the patio with a cooler of fresh air blowing with its' wind. The sun was almost gone when they got out of the pool and turned on the filter as he had done when on the patio. Suddenly the room went to hell as his eyes tried to adjust to the dim light. He was not expecting to see her standing there.</p> <p>"Oh my god!" he exclaimed.</p> <p>"Hi!" she said and kissed him gently on the lips before walking her hand behind her back.</p> <p>"How's the water?" He asked her gently.</p> <p>"I think it's fine!" she replied and returned to her bedroom and started undressing. She bent over the side of the bed and pulled her sundress over her head as she went back to her bed.</p> <p>"I'm sorry!" he said after he had seen her naked body naked for hoursâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
