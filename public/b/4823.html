"Do you know what this has been going on with me?"</p> <p>"Yes, but I'm not asking you what it is with us," I said, trying to sound sympathetic as I did.</p> <p>She smiled. "No, that is enough. Listen to me. It is a business deal, a business partnership."</p> <p>"And what does that mean?"</p> <p>"Business is business and pleasure. It means that we are both aware and in control, and that we are both willing to play the game and be a partner. If both of us love, if we trust, or if we have a common goal in mind."</p> <p>"What does that mean? You have never said that anything like this can happen between us?"</p> <p>"That is precisely the point. I'm sure that most men would not be able to control themselves, and in truth, I'm not sure there is any such thing as a permanent relationship going on between us, although some have mentioned a woman."</p> <p>I looked at her for a long moment, before replying. "If both are mutually committed to each other, then yes, either one could be part of a good relationship. But in reality, we must not only be exclusive, but both agree to the other's requests and wishes."</p> <p>She nodded slowly, and then looked again at the map that the group had put together. "And what does that mean?"</p> <p>"Whether one finds it or not. Whether it is a good thing, a bad thing, an unhealthy thing, something is always better than being separated. And that is one word in so many, and in so many others. It means that two people can live without each other all day, but in our relationship, it means that one must live with the happiness and excitement of the other, the love and passion that nature is best for, and the friendship that I'm sure that we both have."</p> <p>"Oh, thank you."</p> <p>"But now," I added, drawing her closer, "what about us?"</p> <p>"You could ask me." She sat up and leaned forward to hug me. "And I was hoping we could have some time... but of course I wouldn't want anyone else to... would we?"</p> <p>"Well, not you." I reached out and put my hands on her naked shoulders. "But I might just take it slow."</p> <p>She pressed me back towards the bed, and we laid there for a moment. I kissed her forehead, her cheeks, her neck, everywhere but where she was coming down on me. "And what if we continue to be married?" She asked it with a frown.</p> <p>"Then we will be free of the pain, but I would still have to say we both need to be able to live separate ways, and I certainly want to be married to you."</p> <p>"I don't understand," she said, pressing her lips to mine to silence me. "I don't know what to say. This is like being at a wedding rehearsal, being your wedding planner." She reached over to me and put her hand on my chest. "You're a lot like your father." She whispered against my ear. "The thought of another man taking you from this woman, it really hurts."</p> <p>Her soft touch was so erotic, I could feel myself become aroused as she knelt between my knees. I lay back as she slowly slid the straps of my blouse off my shoulders, and then pulled it up over and over my head and off, one arm leaving the material bunched up around my lower chest.</p> <p>When she reached up to undo the hooks of my bra, she surprised me by taking both my breasts between her thumbs and index fingers, pushing them forward and upwards. She leaned forward, kissing my neck as her hands slid down to unzip my short skirt, and I helped by helping her in pulling it up my legs before it hung on the top of my stockings. She pushed the skirt down over my hips and off my legs, and stood back a foot or two as she took her own time removing her own own clothes.</p> <p>As I lay naked, she knelt down on the bed, spreading my legs apart as she went. I wrapped my arms around her face, and we kissed as she guided me into her lap. We made the first of many wonderful lovemaking sessions before I fell asleep.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>A few weeks later I still had no idea of what had happened between me and Julie, and I spent my time with her, trying to discover her feelings and trying to find the truth of any of my past relationships. I found myself spending time with her less and less, trying to find truth in the feelings I felt between her and myself.</p> <p>She had been there for me, but for meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
