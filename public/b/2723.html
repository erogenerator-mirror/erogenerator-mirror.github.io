As we rounded a bend a couple of buildings and a road rolled up to our left but were ignored. Suddenly a car came up and stopped behind us and a tall woman came around its front and into view. The driver got out and came around to the other side of the car. She leaned close and said, "Well, aren't you glad to meet you. I'm Sally by the way."</p> <p>We said good looking and she said, "Come on in, John. The woman has a surprise for you." They kissed and as they started to walk toward the cars I said, "I'm not going to take very long to get a place, do you know where this is?"</p> <p>"No I don't, but I'd love to go out to lunch for a bite." Sally replied.</p> <p>We were at Sally's home and at the entrance we were met by a young couple of about 25. I introduced Sally, Sue, and Bill before we shook hands on the deal. Bill introduced me as Dave. I explained what Sally was planning. We had two houses in the area we had been looking at to open a store for us. Bill mentioned that he saw a sign and called for Sally to come to him. Sue had already made up her mind that she would go with Bill to look at the store. She called Sally and Bill, and as they got to Bill's car she pulled off and drove toward the nearest town. Sally told Sally about the address on the sign and had to agree with her when Bill handed her a credit card.</p> <p>Sally said she understood completely and turned toward the town, as Bill said with a grin, "I was thinking about coming to town and maybe get something nice for my daughter."</p> <p>Sally said, "We should really pay a little more attention to the road because she could get lost driving." We said we would give them plenty of time. As we stepped out Sue called for Sally to stop and we headed down to check out the sites. Sally got us some burgers, hot dogs, and other items she thought we would like and took notes on their progress. We had already gotten ready for lunch so we headed out to the town. When we parked in the nearest park Sally asked me to call for a few hours to come pick them up at about six. As we sat down Sally took my hand and said, "The surprise will be a little later. First, I want your complete name and the name I have been working on." She showed me three pages and said, "The surprise is going to be different but I can't let you come home with someone else, that will ruin our day." She held the envelope close to my face and closed it with a snap. I turned to Sue and asked, "What? You want to come with me and find out what this was all about?"</p> <p>Sue said, "I'll drive and pick up the groceries and then we can go in the house and I'll take you to the store. It won't have to be as big as you want, there will be lots of space as far as the front and back, but it can go in."</p> <p>Sally asked, "What are you planning on doing there? Will you see if it is right?"</p> <p>Sally replied, "I'll get us some good parking space at our house and I'll park at your place. I'll take you out to the car later and we can go to your car and drop you off or a home and pick up your keys and take them back inside."</p> <p>Sally and I did all the planning. Sally made up hers and Bill and I picked them up and took them home. After dropping off the kids in the basement Sally and I drove back to our house where we stopped at the grocery store to pick up our burgers. The store clerk was at the register, Sally was behind in the food section which looked a lot different from the rest of the store. We decided to go into that store the first thing and take our orders and get the next day out of the way and have them ready. Sally ordered three large chicken pieces, one big and one large, with lettuce. Sue ordered two pork pieces as well with one medium chicken. By the time we had our food and finished our orders Sally and I had all the items and were back on the property almost an hour later. Sally was making plans to get some of the bags she brought from the store so that you could carry all our groceries for the next day. Sue was getting out of the car and asking if Sally and I could go on into the house to get the groceries. We said sure it's fine and picked up the bags and headed to our house.</p> <p>Sue had the groceries loaded and we all had a seat and started to get the food out as we saw our mother and step father coming downâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
