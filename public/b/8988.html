Here, feel what it's like to feel good, to experience the joy I have for you."</p> <p>There is a moment of silence. The anticipation is almost unbearable, but I am not about to rush this, not yet.</p> <p>I'm about to touch her again... and she wants me to. Her body is hot, flushed, a hot fire.</p> <p>I pull you into my lap to take a breath. And feel the heat of her against me and that's when I feel your hand grasp my penis and you begin to work it inside her.</p> <p>I can feel her muscles tighten around me, I can feel the walls of her, and feel the moistness of her as she lets herself lose herself in the pleasure. I'm about to cum, and you hold onto me for balance and move with me, and I'm going to cum inside her, I can feel myself reaching that point where nothing else matters to me but the intense joy of my orgasm.</p> <p>And I feel her body, tense against my body, her hands gripping my arms. She's coming, she wants to come... and that is it... I can't hold it for much longer. I groan as I feel you begin to come, coming inside her, pulsing inside her and then emptying into me.</p> <p>My knees begin to fail me. I manage to sit back and you have your hands around me, helping me to stand up.</p> <p>After we are both satiated, you pull your skirt down and come around to my door. You pull me close, our bodies pressing together... and I can feel that warmth.</p> <p>"Well done."</p> <p>"How did I do?"</p> <p>"It would be my pleasure to tell you."</p> <p>"No, it's not. That was amazing."</p> <p>"I'm glad you enjoyed it."</p> <p>"And I really am."</p> <p>"Is that a yes or a no?"</p> <p>"I'll think of something else I like," she says, looking into my eyes once more. This time her eyes are bright and glistening. You have a sad look in them, one of lust and sadness. "If you can do me again later..."</p> <p>"That's the idea."</p> <p>"I had a pretty good time, Sir."</p> <p>"Yes," I say with a smile, nodding in agreement.</p> <p>"Good, and thank you for letting me do this, Sir... for being such a sweet young lady." As we are in the hallway, she leans in for a kiss, our mouths just touching.</p> <p>When we get in the living room, I stand her up and lead her to the sofa, where I sit down, pull her close and give her a long sensuous kiss.</p> <p>"I'm glad it was all you hoped for," she says. I can see the tears of happiness in her eyes. I can see how much this girl loves me.</p> <p>Your eyes have gone wide as you smile at me. I put on my most seductive voice and say, "You didn't have to do this for me, you did this for me."</p> <p>I turn to you, and say, "It was fun, but I wanted you as much as I wanted you."</p> <p>"I know," you say with a touch of disappointment in your voice. "I really like you like that."</p> <p>"I like you even more now."</p> <p>She smiles. "Can I ask you something?"</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>I can see a bit of a tear in your eyes, but you smile a smile of your own. "I've been thinking, you know, how things started with your Mom..."</p> <p>"But I already know." She gets up from the sofa and goes to the kitchen.</p> <p>"What did you think? What did you like about it?"</p> <p>"The more I think about it, the more I think about it. I'll be honest with you."</p> <p>You smile. "You can be so damn right. Now please come with me to your room." You put your arms around me and pull me down for a hug, kissing me on the mouth. I can feel her breathing in my ear and it's a little unnerving to be so close to you. Then she pulls back to smile at you.</p> <p>"I really like your kiss." After we kiss, she moves in to me again and says, "I think that I like you better here than at home." I let her arms go and move down between your legs, I gently squeeze your leg. I kiss you again, feeling your arousal rising, then turn to lay on the sofa opposite youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
