His skin, so light, so cool, it still felt as if she was wrapped in a hot blanket. Her body melted into his, the passion and the lust of her heart growing between their bodies.</p> <p>Mikael’s fingers began tracing her stomach. She closed her eyes as he moved higher; they both felt the warmth as it spread across her breasts and he ran his thumb over her hard nipples until they were ready to burst. She arched her back, her body tightening, her mouth parting with a low moan. His mouth moved over the flesh of her shoulder before he began latching onto her nipple gently. She let her head fall back, arching her back, her body arching against the contact.</p> <p>He trailed his lips over her, sucking and licking around her areola. She arched her back more, her hands reaching down to wrap on the back of his head. Her hips were meeting his, seeking more, her body begging him.</p> <p>“Come on, Mikael.”</p> <p>He pulled back and knelt over her, their bodies still trembling.</p> <p>His eyes watched her as the fire burned brightly in the fireplace. She felt her knees buckle as he turned her body to his, her eyes never stopping as he leaned over her to kiss her again. He pulled his member from his shorts and pushed forward, feeling every millimeter enter her. Her hand reached upward to encircle it as it moved forward, her body shaking as it filled her. As his erection rested against her body, he reached between their bodies and began to lightly caress her pussy.</p> <p>Her arms lifted her upper body, his back arching with his movements. He ran his fingertips over her stomach, making every crease as it curved outward. She was so close now, her body begging for his touch.</p> <p>“Oh, Mikael…”</p> <p>She ran her fingers down his chest, feeling as if electricity flowed through his skin. They both moaned as his fingers touched her most private place. Her skin had become slick, his hardness leaving a little indentation as it emerged from his body. She continued stroking him as he worked her body, both of them panting and sweating as he slowly worked her body.</p> <p>It did not take long before she felt his body tremble in a climax.</p> <p>He lowered his head down and pulled up, his lips meeting her nipple and sending pleasure through her body. Their passion rising as their bodies slowed, Mikael moved down and kissed her belly as he continued the journey.</p> <p>Mikael had to move.</p> <p>“You are beautiful,” he said as he lifted himself off of her.</p> <p>“I know,” she replied as her body slid away.</p> <p>He leaned down and began to lick her abdomen. He licked up and down, circling her belly button before licking down again. His fingers trailed over her body. He could feel her body tense as he moved closer. He slid his body up hers, his erection between her legs. He moved back down and began to lick her vagina again. Her body started to quiver slightly and Mikael felt her hand run up and down his shaft. He continued to lick her breasts until she begged him to lick her again.</p> <p>Mikael moved his head back and forth, making the circles as he pulled her hips back from the floor. She felt him press against her and her hips were rising to meet him. He moved in and out of her like a jackhammer while she reached her hand down and began to play with her clit. This brought a low groan from her lips as her orgasm approached.</p> <p>Mikael pulled his head away. “I need to stop!”</p> <p>“No, Mikael.”</p> <p>“I want to do you,” he insisted.</p> <p>“Then let me.”</p> <p>His head flew back, his whole body flexing with the pressure of her body. He moved in and out quicker than before, his body jerking with each contact, his head turning to her as the walls of their bodies tightened around him. She was on the brink of exploding. As her body went stiff as if it would break out of pure desire, he felt himself begin to lose his self control.</p> <p>He pushed forward against her body as he began to cum, his head snapping from side-to-side as he pumped his seed into her.
