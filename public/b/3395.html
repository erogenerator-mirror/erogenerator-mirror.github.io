As it was, she took one last long look at her reflection in the mirror. It had been a long week, and her body was taut, with a very defined figure.</p> <p>She smiled to herself as she ran a hand over her breasts, massaging her nipples between her fingers, then, as she began to move her hands, she saw the muscles tighten and grow. She wanted to be in charge, she needed to do something to give her body control.</p> <p>She wanted to feel his hard prick in her mouth. She felt him move, as though he was holding her hips for balance.</p> <p>Her hips moved as he moved inside her, her body rocked with lust and urgency. She wrapped her arms around his neck in a crushing embrace.</p> <p>All those weeks of teasing him, her teasing him, teasing her, as she had to endure countless orgasms. Now, she lay there, waiting for him to fill her with his seed. She took his hands in hers, and drew them down her body to rest on her breasts. She felt it, and he massaged them, and tweaked her nipples, and pulled on them.</p> <p>"You know why I have to get more work done," she said into his ear. She wanted it all off. But she was not going to take it if he did not like her. Her body responded to his touch, her breasts, and her nipples.</p> <p>"You're my boss. I'll do my chores. When you come out of the interview, I'll take care to make a quick visit home to put in my shoes and bring everything home so you can do the right things. Just come when you're ready." He pulled her close to him before slipping out of the room.</p> <p>She lay on her stomach, exhausted from all the teasing. Her body ached, and she wanted more. How could this moment end if she were no longer willing to give in to her sexual needs?</p> <p>She heard the door open, and the lock start to click. She stretched, hoping that it would be him. But it did not. She heard movement behind her.</p> <p>Then, the door opened and she felt his lips against her shoulder, and heard him say, "I'm not leaving until you can take me." She tried to turn but he stopped her. She felt him press her hips downward, and her pussy spread for him, opening for him.</p> <p>He grabbed her hips and pulled them upward until her ass was hanging off of the desk, offering the wetness to his eager cock. He pushed forward slowly until he was buried fully in her body. Then, he began his journey to her pussy. She felt him, her body responding to him.</p> <p>Her hips began to sway back and forth as he rocked his cock into her in time with his movements. She could tell that he was building, wanting his orgasm. He moved his hands from her breasts to her ass. He slipped both hands down her body, pulling her to him for another deep, passionate kiss.</p> <p>When he rolled over, her body slid backward toward his. Her hands still held himself over her, letting him slip in and out of her. She felt his hand slide down her stomach to her pussy, and then back up, slowly. "You're very wet," he said, kissing her neck.</p> <p>"That's because I'm just so ready for your cock," she replied.</p> <p>Soon, his body was on top of hers, his hands stroking her body as his cock pumped into her. She could feel each of his thick, hot spurts of cum hitting her inner walls, feeling him filling her with each stroke until there was nowhere else left to go. She wanted so much more, but he wouldn't let her. They never could have sex again. Then, he rolled off of her back, taking his cock and the sheets with it, and the two of them lay their head on her chest, breathing deeply.</p> <p>She knew that there was far to be distance between them, but she didn't know exactly how far. She tried to turn around, to face his face.</p> <p>"I've missed your kisses," he said, as he rubbed her belly, "but I can't help giving you more."</p> <p>"Oh! No!" she protested, "I couldn't even come into the office."</p> <p>As she continued to hold her body to hers, his kisses moved from her face, to her neck, and finally to her mouth. She met his lips, allowing just a tiny bit of tongue, as they kissed. She pulled back in a half-hearted effort to pull away from their passion.
