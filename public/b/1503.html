That's not what I'm here for. No, not what I'm here for at least one night. This guy's here for you tonight, for you to fuck or be fucked. His name is Brian...well Brian...you know Brian better than Brian...oh, yes."</p> <p>My heart felt like it was going to jump out of my chest again then stop.</p> <p>"I don't know you," I whispered. "If this guy wants this girl to do that, I'm not going to refuse. Just remember I'm willing to take anything you put there."</p> <p>He smiled. "Don't hold back. I want you...you know this girl...you have to give her a chance, Brian. You can't just throw me down for what I really want." He gave a small smile then added, "I never thought you'd do this."</p> <p>My pussy twitched knowing full well that even in his situation, I would do it for him. I couldn't hold back my tears as I spoke again.</p> <p>"It's Brian, my Brian," I finally cried out. "My Brian."</p> <p>"Yes it is...oh, God, it's Brian to you...you want it."</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Then I'll give you that chance."</p> <p>He leaned in, pressed himself against me and kissed me. His lips were soft and as he kissed me, I felt his body. His body was hot against mine and he was naked. His arms were around my body, his hands were all over, and now they were around my back, holding me close. I felt his erection against my thigh then he was lying on top of me.</p> <p>We kissed as I felt him press himself against me. My heart raced wildly and my chest began to rise and fall. I could feel the heat from my pussy on his crotch.</p> <p>"Kiss me...kiss me...fuck the shit out of me with your hard cock."</p> <p>He kissed me, his tongue slowly tracing my lips. His hands cupped my face and he smiled while gently biting my bottom lip. I felt his hardness as it pressed against me. The smell of him was thick and strong, and I felt like I should be repulsed by him but I was helpless to do anything about it. That feeling of being his prey, captive and his for his lustful desires was arousing all the way to the point where my own cock began to betray me.</p> <p>I closed my eyes and parted my lips. I felt them part.</p> <p>"Kiss me," I whispered. "Lick me...please..."</p> <p>His lips opened and his mouth crushed mine. My lips felt soft and welcoming. His lips were a bit softer and he was a bit more forceful. I closed my eyes and enjoyed the feeling.</p> <p>"Kiss me," I whispered. "Kiss me, make love to me, Brian."</p> <p>"Is it okay if I taste you?" he asked.</p> <p>I opened my eyes to gaze at him and replied, "I sure as hell hope you do...maybe...maybe you'll try."</p> <p>He kissed me some more so I opened my eyes and I saw his eyes on me as if he was looking in on me.</p> <p>"Kiss me," I whispered again as his kiss became more urgent. I felt his tongue sliding against mine.</p> <p>Brian was kneeling between my thighs, which I spread to accommodate him. I opened my eyes as much as possible only to see them open and the look on Brian's face as he looked at me while I spread myself open to him, wanting him to see what I had for him.</p> <p>"Kiss me," I softly said again. "Kiss me, Brian...make love to me."</p> <p>"Kiss you?" he asked before he leaned in to kiss me again. This time, he took my mouth in a lover's kiss.</p> <p>My arms tightened around him as I opened my eyes and we stared into each other's eyes as we kissed. My heart was beating wildly and my body was shaking. I closed my eyes and pressed myself closer to him.</p> <p>At the same time, the warmth of my body felt soft on his chest. He had taken off his shirt and I could feel his body against mine. My hands were still wrapped around him, feeling the warmth of his muscular chest.</p> <p>"Kiss me, Brian," I softly said again. "Kiss me, taste me, make love to me."</p> <p>His kisses were like kisses from heaven, his hands were on me, exploring me over with his mouth, touching me all over, feeling me.</p> <p>"Do you like what you're feeling?" he asked as he moved his mouth away from mine. "Tell me."</p> <p>"Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
