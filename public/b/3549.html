"Okay... so, can we discuss everything now?"</p> <p>She looked back at the house like if I was going to get married on Monday. What could I do? I could still be with her and still get to stay with her.</p> <p>"Fine," I said, not wanting to wait to go through with this, "But we're only going to take so much of whatever we think can be accomplished."</p> <p>She stared at me with those intense green eyes for the entire time. "You know I'm your best friend. I'm not going to break it up, but I'm not going to ruin your friendship, are you?" she asked, a look of genuine disappointment in her eyes.</p> <p>"I guess I'll have to take it slowly, huh?" I said with a sly grin, hoping that her feelings for me would finally let go of control of their current situation.</p> <p>"Yeah... what do you think?" she said with a wink, which led to another quick hug and kiss on my lips.</p> <p>"Now you better go put down that drink; I'll walk."</p> <p>"Okay, bye," she smiled.</p> <p>I turned to turn on some music, but instead of getting up I stood out in the middle of the room, watching her walk across the room with a big smile on her face. I noticed that she did not have panties on and she definitely had nothing on underneath.</p> <p>"Wow, that's amazing," I gushed, standing right in front of her with my hands on my hips, trying to think what it could be like to touch her... maybe to kiss her... anything.</p> <p>"What do you think?" she asked, taking a step back, while putting her hand against the wall as if offering her a good shot, "Do you want something? Or just go out to dinner?"</p> <p>"Oh, sure," I said as she gave me a coy look and a little wave. "I'll grab my things. See you in an hour?" and I headed back to my room.</p> <p>After several minutes I heard a knock on my door, which I quickly pulled back in my lap as Kate's voice called out, "You in there?"</p> <p>I looked down as she walked back into the room and pulled me in. "I'm in here," I said with a laugh as she gave me a long sexy smile and started to put my clothes in my locker.</p> <p>"Oh my fucking god, is that how you go around people, you know?!" Kate said, turning towards me and giving me a huge hug, "You'll never guess where that kiss was, but you'll never forget it."</p> <p>"I'll remember that kiss," I whispered, hoping that Kate could forget about how I feel about her.</p> <p>"Mmm, I'm in the mood for a little fun," she said with a grin, "Are you ready to go?"</p> <p>"Well if you say so," I said as she walked over and gave me a big hug.</p> <p>"I'll let you know if I'm coming back later," I said as she pulled away, leaving me standing there with a huge grin on my faceâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
