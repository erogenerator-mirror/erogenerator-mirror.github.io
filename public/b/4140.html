I was now a little turned on by the fact that so much had happened in the past two years and even so she seemed like a very interesting person.</p> <p>I then said, "Well I am going to give her a big hug, you can join me in a couple minutes."</p> <p>I went to the refrigerator and grabbed a bag of food and put it on the counter. I walked to the back door and knocked.</p> <p>"Come closer," she said as she stepped inside the door.</p> <p>I walked to the other side of the kitchen and closed it behind her as she gave me a very warm kiss. Then she had me open the fridge and pulled out some food. We sat around the table eating and talking as we spoke.</p> <p>She gave me another warm kiss, but this time she took her time licking and sucking my lips to make them really wet and she made me feel good. She had one of her hands on one of my breasts and I was squeezing her hard nipples through her robe as she continued to play with them while talking to me and then she did the same to me. I loved it.</p> <p>We finished eating and had to go back to the living room before they could come and get us for what was going to take place, which wasn't very often.</p> <p>We got up to leave and made our way to her bedroom. On the way I looked at the pictures of a young woman on the bed. We stood in the doorway and I started to open her robe to look at it. She closed her robe and moved closer to me. She had very small breasts and if anything there were even less of them than my wife's. I couldn't make that statement aloud.</p> <p>"Would you like to see something like this?" she asked. I reached out to touch them.</p> <p>My mind just went wild with the thought of what I might like to do with them but still I couldn't say anything. So I just leaned forward and took her left nipple into my mouth and went right on. She didn't say anything. I kept licking and sucking.</p> <p>We went on like that for a long time, just enjoying each other's body as we did it. I kept at her for a long time. She finally made me stop and just lay on the side of the bed naked, holding me.</p> <p>I just lay there and she was still holding me. My hand went down between her legs and caressed her little clit. She said, "That's enough of that. Come over here. Now come over here with me and play with me."</p> <p>I stood and walked over to her and she was still kneeling on the bed, her head on one of the pillows. I knelt between her legs and took my hands and lifted them up to her breasts and held them.</p> <p>I began to work my lips down her stomach as my own excitement grew. I got the first nipple in my mouth and sucked it and then went on down to the second.</p> <p>I looked at her and she said, "Just enjoy your orgasm. I like that."</p> <p>I felt her hand on the back of my head and she began to gently force me down over the first nipple. I was enjoying just having my mouth and body touched at the same time.</p> <p>There was lots of movement around us as I sucked on her nipple first and then moved to her pussy. I licked her clit and then slid up to taste her.</p> <p>I got a mouthful of the clear fluids and sucked her clit into my mouth to feel it grow under my lips.</p> <p>She started with small moans and soon was urging me to go even faster as her body began to thrash about under my mouth.</p> <p>In the middle of her thrashing she began to say, "More, that's so good. That feels so good!"</p> <p>With the next moan she said, "I need you. I need you!"</p> <p>As she was speaking with each moan she was reaching her own climax. I kept at her, licking her through her whole orgasm as it slowly faded into her head. I kept this up until she had almost passed out.</p> <p>I turned to her and asked, "What do you want me to do next?" She said, "Lick me just a little higher right nowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
