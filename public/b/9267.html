It was pretty clear she was going to make him feel better, even if his lack of response to what she'd done was only just coming on.</p> <p>The kiss went on, and she didn't want it to end, so she opened her eyes to him and looked at him. "You ready to be my slut?" she asked her eyes sparkling with excitement.</p> <p>"Fuck yes," he growled, "Fuck yes! Now get on all fours!"</p> <p>When she'd turned around to get into position, he stepped forward and grabbed her ass.</p> <p>"Fuck me now!" she commanded.</p> <p>He rammed his cock home, and she screamed and wailed. When they came, it was amazing, an explosion so powerful it tore through them both.</p> <p>When they were done, Amy was sitting on the couch, panting and covered in his juices, his spunk still drooling from the tip but on her lips.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>The first words to come out of Amy's mouth were:</p> <p>"That was fucking amazing..."</p> <p>"Yes, it was," Tom agreed. Amy looked down at him, grinning. "I've been waiting so long for it, haven't I, Amy?"</p> <p>He nodded. "It certainly is. It's always been an obsession, now I can finally have you."</p> <p>Then she looked up at him. "I haven't ever said that to a guy before."</p> <p>Tom grinned back, then looked back down. "But I hope I didn't hurt you."</p> <p>"No you didn't. I never meant for it to hurt. That's why I thought it would just be natural. It would be perfect just the way it is. What about you, Tom? What about your little plan for me?"</p> <p>"Well, you know you can expect to live in that same house with my family, and your whole family. They'll never know."</p> <p>Amy smiled. "If you want, I could live here with your family. It's just so much nicer out now."</p> <p>"You need to find someone else," he told her. "There's no reason to have you work at my family any more."</p> <p>"Yes," she grinned. "I guess I've just needed a little bit of that freedom."</p> <p>He nodded. "But I'll be OK with just you and I."</p> <p>"Thanks," Amy said, "It just makes it that much harder to get laid now, that's all."</p> <p>They got up to leave.</p> <p>*****</p> <p>When they got back to the house, all three looked at each other.</p> <p>Mark said, "I should do something. I'm only a small girl, but there may be one or two things I could do."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"I'm still a virgin. What would you do with me?"</p> <p>Amy smiled. "I can't say I'd make up anything," she said. "But I guess you're young, too."</p> <p>"I'm not too young," he assured her.</p> <p>"Maybe I should have guessed right," Amy said, with a grin. "But we still have to do something."</p> <p>"Yes, we do," he said. He took Amy's arm and they headed upstairs to her bedroomâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
