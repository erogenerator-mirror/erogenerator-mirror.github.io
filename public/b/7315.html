"They're not real?" she asked herself.</p> <p>She stood up, put her hands on her hips and, turning around, faced back in the tub. She had a towel on and it was wrapped around her midsection so she didn't have anything that would cover up. Her boobs stuck out and swayed when she moved.</p> <p>"I'm not sure what I thought I would say about the guys, but..." she asked herself. She looked around in the room for the towel, but couldn't find any. She went to work on her neck and felt all her muscles tighten as she massaged her neck and back. She felt her body respond.</p> <p>Finally she turned around and saw the women in the tub with the other women. Looking over her shoulder, she saw the one girl in the tub with the other woman standing close. She looked at the woman closely then at the woman in front of her then back at the woman directly in front of her. She watched as the other woman moved her arm and smiled.</p> <p>"I really can't help it," the man said, looking intently at the other woman. He held his arm tightly about the middle of her back while she slid her hand down onto his chest.</p> <p>"Oh, no, sorry," she said as she moved his hand toward the lower part of her backside. "We're married."</p> <p>"So, did I?" he asked. "It's okay if you guys are married?"</p> <p>"Oh, yes," she answered. "The whole time I was your boyfriend I was just a little shy, and we never actually did anything like what you and I did and I wouldn't get into a fight or something so we never actually got married," she said as she looked at his arm.</p> <p>"So, you're not into girls here?" the man asked.</p> <p>"Not at all," she answered. "It's just different. I feel really safe right now with just you, not them. I've never been with a guy for that long, but I can tell you I'm not really a virgin there either."</p> <p>"I'm sorry," he said.</p> <p>"For who?" she asked as her body tensed up. She moved the other arm along his chest.</p> <p>"You, honey," he replied. "For me."</p> <p>"I guess we are," she said. "I really enjoyed it, and, if you'd like to do me some more I think that would be fine. I'll ask you if you're still up for it."</p> <p>"Okay," he said. "I'm up and ready now. Let's start.</p> <p>There was no hesitation on her part. She felt the water from the tub and then she moved her hand back into Heather's backside. She rubbed the soft skin of her behind and watched as it seemed to tighten. The water made her whole body tingle.</p> <p>When she touched Heather it was a new experience and she found it quite erotic. She was feeling very strange and she felt like she was getting turned on as well, too. She was also starting to like feeling the other woman's breasts pressing over her while Heather's cock pressed into her body while they kissed.</p> <p>When she broke her kiss her fingers left her backside. She looked at him for a moment. They were both staring each other with those lovely eyes and her arms were starting to tremble. He couldn't tell from his look or hers the difference between whether or not she was turned on or whether or not it was a turn-on for him, but it had been a long time and he was willing to take it to the next level if that's what she wanted.</p> <p>"I don't know where you guys go from here, and I really don't care, but I think it's time for us to start back upstairs," she said as she stood up and turned her back toward him.</p> <p>When their bodies again touched and she felt the water against her face, she turned around to face him and they kissed. It felt so strange and exciting. A couple, who had never kissed a girl before, had just let her have her first lesbian kiss because she was nervous about kissing her. Now she was giving into a feeling that she was about to feel and she was not sure that it was right.</p> <p>The kisses became more urgent as they tried to keep contact from slipping between them. His hands went from rubbing the side of her breasts in up and down her back to her waist. He felt her tense against his chest. Then he put his hand behind her head and put his mouth over hers. She responded by wrapping her arms around him. She kissed him lightly and sucked on his lower lip as they continued their soft kiss.</p> <p>When the tongue thatâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
