She had an odd expression of disappointment, even at times she was worried of losing him. This was different though; it was just a natural emotion.</p> <p>On the other hand, she enjoyed her life, and if it could be any other way than the way she had planned, this would be the perfect opportunity. He had been so polite, so sweet, so good to her...all things that she was so determined to ignore, but it had been worth it for a brief instant. This time, as their relationship developed, she felt safe. Of course, he had respected her independence. He didn't want to be her lover. He didn't want to know anything about how it would go with him. And she didn't want to have any expectations; after all, he had only been interested in sex for a short amount of time and then, just now, it was time for intercourse! She felt some strange affection for him when she had him for dinner once. It was a warm feeling she had never felt in a while; this was so very new and, as it had been for as long as she had been alive, it seemed natural that someone like him would be attracted to her.</p> <p>She felt an almost physical attraction to him. She couldn't help it, especially after the first day of their relationship. It was not just physical. Something had been bothering her, and she knew, it was a man's problem. Even though he felt sorry for her and wanted to comfort her, there was one thing he did to make her feel better.</p> <p>"That was just a one shot; there's more for the future." she told herself. After all, what guy wouldn't be interested in the future?</p> <p>He was not a guy. And although she never really considered herself attracted to men, she was certainly attracted to him. There had been many a time before a woman had found herself attracted to him, and, after some probing, she had come to the conclusion that it was no stretch of his imagination for someone the same sex to be attracted to him. She had always been afraid that she had no intention or intention of going with a man for another man, and this was the first time, well, the first time that she felt something she wanted to feel with a man.</p> <p>Even though, the fact was that she was attracted to a man, her sex life was quite vanilla.</p> <p>When her mother died, it was more of a tragedy. And, while the first few years were very kind to her and, after having both of her father's children, it seemed that even as her mother died, that she was never alone, they would try to protect her from being alone in her life. She knew that once she was no longer an all-girls' high school beauty queen, it was not going to be very difficult for her.</p> <p>And, besides, it would make a great story to tell her friends.</p> <p>It was a small change in the way that she had felt, and she knew that, even though she didn't look too much like the other girls she knew, she was definitely still a hot little redhead. She had always been a pretty, slender, tall, voluptuous girl; the kind of girl that could go the length of the local high school and, if you could, have the confidence to stand outside for a day to day trouble.</p> <p>But, on the rare occasions when she had the chance, that little smile never left her face, and she was ever-so-lightly lessening the size and shape of her breasts. She had no real trouble attracting guys, she just preferred to be careful, or to be a bit of a prude, she didn't like to admit it. But, her mother had warned her. She had also come from a strict, strict, religious family. Most people thought of her as a "child", but everyone knew that it wasn't a child; it was a young man's daughter that had a "problem"...</p> <p>She had been raised by a strict, religious family when she was too young to have a problem or a problem. She had been taught, and knew by her parents, that, as a young woman, "not only bad luck can be made," but should not be so widely accepted, "but, be careful as well, for if you become too much in need of someone to care for you, you might find yourself in a situation where you might need someone to help you, or, for the most part, somebody to control you."</p> <p></p> <p>She had been given an allowance and, when she came of age at seventeen, had been given the option of going to college, she was enrolled in an upper mid-level liberal arts college in a liberal city, located somewhere near to where she knew her friends would be. Her parents had encouraged her, not only at theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
