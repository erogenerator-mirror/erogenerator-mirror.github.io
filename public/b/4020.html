She reached for her clothes from the bed. While I dressed, I turned around in the bathroom. I could see her looking around the room. Then, I could see that I wasn’t finished. I picked up my shorts, and slipped them on. As I finished dressing, I walked back into the bedroom and pulled my underwear on. I walked back out and saw my daughter staring.</p> <p>"Did that make you happy?"</p> <p>"Oh my god," she replied, obviously in shock. "You are so beautiful!"</p> <p>"I told you that I’m just as sexually inexperienced as you are," I joked.</p> <p>"Please don’t call me that! It’s embarrassing," she pleaded.</p> <p>"Don't worry about it, sweetheart."</p> <p>"No," she continued as if I still made the decision.</p> <p>"We can always call you mom," I concluded.</p> <p>"I don’t want to be Mrs. Parker," she answered.</p> <p>"So, I guess it’s up to you how you feel about me now."</p> <p>I leaned over and kissed her softly. She returned it with passion. Eventually, we both broke the kiss and walked back to our room. She was still sitting up on the bed, which was now strewn with clothes. As she sat up, I picked up my shirt and tossed it into the corner. Standing, I tossed my blouse and panties to a chair and pulled my socks off. I turned around and sat on the bed. I was naked. After I buttoned my jeans, I walked over to Katie’s night table. I was sure Katie was getting an eyeful of my body now.</p> <p>"You look beautiful," I complimented her when I reached for a towel that had been laying on the bed. I wiped my body dry, then got an afghan blanket. Katie had thrown together a large quilt for her mother, even though she was still in her bedroom. "You are making me feel beautiful," she said as I laid the thick quilt in front of her. I picked up the quilt and turned out the light. I laid the blanket over the quilt. It was now dark. Katie walked over to me, and we kissed passionately. This time, we kissed with the same passion. I placed my hand between her thighs. I touched her swollen labia. She moaned and pushed her hips up. I dipped my fingers into her. She moaned again as my tongue found her clit. Katie’s hips ground against my hand. She cried out when I sucked her clit. Our bodies writhed and we moaned together. Katie’s hands held my head, pushing me to her. Her breathing was coming in short, deep moans. I couldn’t wait any longer. I knelt before Katie. I kissed it, as I slid my tongue between those dark, wet labia…her clit. My tongue circled it. I licked it. My fingers probed. Katie moaned louder. I inserted my finger into her. She moaned again. My tongue flicked her clit. Katie’s moans and whimpering encouraged me, as she pushed her hips harder against my face. I looked up at her and her eyes were closed to match my gaze. We both moaned loudly as our bodies rocked in ecstasy. When we quieted, we both panted. I kissed her mouth. It took her a moment to catch her breath.</p> <p>"Wow," I whispered.</p> <p>"Wow," she repeated softly.</p> <p>"I don’t know how I’ve gotten so lucky like this." I sat up a bit and put my arms around her. She held me. We lay in bed for a few minutes.</p> <p>"I don’t want to spoil you. You’re beautiful and I love the way you look naked with me. Let’s get back in bed," I murmured.</p> <p>"This does make getting out of that room a little easier," she answered softly.</p> <p>"I know."</p> <p>Once back in our bed, I kissed Katie deeply. She pulled back and looked into my eyes.</p> <p>"I love you," she said as she kissed me again.</p> <p>"I love you, too, baby."</p> <p>Katie smiled. I kissed her neck and her shoulders. I sucked lightly on her ear. I moved lower to get more of her. We kissed. I slid down her body. Katie whimpered when I moved closer, but didn't fight me. I teased her body with kisses here and there, as my lips traveled from her chin down to her neck. I sucked gently on her neck. We were both in ecstasy. As our mouths met again, our tongues touched.
