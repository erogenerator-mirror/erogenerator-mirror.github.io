I've been a good girl."</p> <p>The two of them took a break.</p> <p>"So this is going to be your last," said the other blonde, her eyes sparkling.</p> <p>I felt better than I had in a long time, I felt like I had been put through a whole world of feelings. "The night is young," I said. "I'm all yours."</p> <p>And that I did.</p> <p>+++</p> <p>The rest of the week passed pretty well. We talked for hours during the next day's run, and the four of us shared an early dinner. The wine had worn me down a bit, and I was determined to give the ladies all of their attention, when that came and went, in a matter of days. I was the luckiest guy alive when our time was finally up. I had no way of knowing that it was going to be a week of bliss just for the three of us.</p> <p>On Monday, I sat around in my truck, waiting.</p> <p>"I'm looking forward to it," said the blonde, standing before the mirror. "You're going to get your chance to take it off first. I want you to strip," she said. She had a smirk on her face in a way that didn't make me much more than a quick giggle.</p> <p>I hadn't seen that coming, but the two of us in my truck had. What I didn't know was that she had no idea that I got her off. I had never cheated on her before, and my experience in the bedroom hadn't been anything to complain about. I was more than willing, knowing full well that she was going to leave me for another guy, and if she did, I would die in a heartbeat.</p> <p>Then, after all, she got me out of the way. She had a way of leaving me alone in a room without anyone looking at us.</p> <p>I waited.</p> <p>+++</p> <p>I had already been out when the women entered.</p> <p>One of the women stood beside us, staring at me.</p> <p>The others were dressed as a third party for the event, wearing the same outfit as we'd worn last time, but different in that they all wore similar outfits. When I had said I was looking forward to it, it seemed a little silly that I hadn't been there before. Not that I wasn't feeling pretty - that wasn't much wrong - but I'm not sure I had any experience in it at all. The women were in heels, stockings, heels with just a sliver of a thong covering their most sensitive nerve ends. In a few seconds they would be standing next to me. They were the only person in the room that I had to tell who was who. The first woman, a brunette with long hair, was standing next to her. The other two were in their sixties. Each had just stepped out of her heels to hold their own. The brunette was tall, a bit larger, taller than me, she certainly was. The brunette had medium sized breasts, but they weren't as big as mine. They stood out proudly on her tiny frame, but the nipples were large and dark and stood stiffly. They looked to be a little more than a little excited.</p> <p>The taller woman, an upturned Asian, stepped forward. She was looking at me. She stood, too, watching me, and I saw her smile.</p> <p>"Welcome to our party," she said. "I am Sakeena, the manager of the club." The tall woman walked with her to the women. Her eyes went to my lap and I saw her look between my legs.</p> <p>"We were hoping that would be all," said Sakeena, smiling wider. The tall redhead sat. She looked my eyes up and down and saw what I was looking at.</p> <p>"Oh, you're one hot thing, I don't know what's going on."</p> <p>"Me either. I saw you with my first friend in the back of your truck, though I don't believe it." Her gaze was a little longer than we'd been and then she spoke again. Her eyes looked up at me a short time later and then she looked as though she was remembering my name after something from her past.</p> <p>She started talking about her life. I followed along and listened as Sakeena talked. When she finished, the other woman stood to my left.</p> <p>"He's so nice to us," said Sakeena. She reached up and grabbed the other woman's breasts.</p> <p>The woman held her hands up as if she was giving me a death glare. She looked at Sakeena and motioned me over to her.</p> <p>"Well, well, look where the 'un's a sight for sore eyes," she said.
