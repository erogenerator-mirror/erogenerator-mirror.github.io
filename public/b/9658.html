Slowly I raised my hand to her face and cupped her cheek. I gently kissed her lips, then her eyes, and on to her mouth, which I tasted as if it had been there. She opened her mouth and I slipped my tongue past her lips. She sucked my tongue into her mouth and moaned as I caressed her tongue with mine.</p> <p>The kiss was warm and passionate. We broke the kiss and looked into each others eyes. I saw a bit of uncertainty in her eyes as I ran my finger down her face, brushing the tip of her lip, then over her chin, before moving down to rest directly upon her lips. She immediately responded, slipping my tongue between her lips and probing it with her own. Her taste was intoxicating, a little saltiness at first, but quickly replaced what she had experienced before, and I wanted more.</p> <p>I took her hand and placed it atop my lap, holding it in place. It felt cold and she jumped a bit at the sensation of it. “I… I don’t know,” she said. “I think I’ll be okay.” My face was again in her hands. “I’ve thought about kissing you, but never with anyone else,” she said. “But you’ve made love,” I told her as I kissed her lips a little longer, my lips smacking her gently.</p> <p>I moved my face slowly down to her neck and took one nipple into my mouth. It sent waves of pleasure though her body and she moaned gently. I gently kissed and licked her chest and neck, down to her chest, my lips caressing over each of her breasts, feeling her nipples harden beneath my tongue, and feeling her nipples get even harder in my mouth. I kissed back up to her other breast and once again began to kiss and lick the flesh around her nipple. When my mouth closed around her nipple and began to suck and suck it, I felt her breast jump under my tongue. “Oooooh Godddddd.” she moaned. “Don’t stop.” Her hips were thrusting up towards my face as an orgasm built within her.</p> <p>I let her nipple go from my mouth as I slid my hand down over her clit, moving it up and over it. I felt the warm wetness of her clit on my hand as it was being rubbed over it. I stroked her clit in little circles, feeling her body writhe as I did. She was getting close to orgasm now, and I didn’t think that I would be able to hold out for long.</p> <p>“Mmmmm,” she moaned, her voice a little hoarse. “I love it when you do that,” she moaned. “I… ohhhh, it feels so good… ohhh that feels so good… oh, keep doing that and I’ll come… oh, I’m coming… ahhhhhhh! Oh, I’m coming… yes, ahhhhh,” she moaned, clutching my head with both hands as she pressed my face tight against her.</p> <p>“That was wonderful,” I said, as I took my mouth from her nipple. She looked at me as the waves of her orgasm subsided. “It’s been a long time since I've come like that,” she told me as she lay back on the bed. They were soaked.</p> <p>“My turn, now.” And she lifted herself on her knees and spread her thighs wide for me. I moved between them, pressing my body down into hers as my face came in close. I kissed her navel, running my tongue through its ring, making her shudder. I trailed my tongue down to her pussy, licking the area around and over her clit for a moment, then kissing it. I slipped my tongue inside her with a low growl, and she let out a sigh. I kissed her pussy lips a few times, then kissed her clit again.</p> <p>“Oh,” she said. “That is so good with a tongue inside you,” I said. I flicked it a few times across her cunt, causing her to moan for me. The feel of her lips and the tip of my tongue brought her to a peak. She took one hand and slipped it down to her breasts and began to massage and caress them. She held her breasts up and looked up at me, smiling. She had such a sexy smile on her face. “Just like that,” she said, still looking down at me. “Just a little harder,” she told me.</p> <p>I—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
