I can see that he has a sense of anticipation as we stand under the stars staring out over the town. We turn to say goodbye to him when I notice that we are about ten houses down from the one we used to live. We just stand there, as he and I look back at how many houses we have. After what seems like hours we reach home and walk home.</p> <p>Back in my bedroom I throw on some shorts and a polo shirt and head for the shower. I can see that the water is going pretty slow as I have to use it all off. It feels good to be out of the house. After getting out I get in the shower and turn the shower off. I let myself off and use the soap to soap myself up. I turn on the shower and when the water is warm enough I put the soap on my hands and start to put my hands down my body. Slowly I rub the soap on my body and start to turn to put my hands back up over my chest. I turn to see a shadow in the shower mirror.</p> <p>"Come on, let me do that for you," I say to myself as I turn the water off and lean back against the shower wall letting the warmth of the water wash over me. It feels incredible! The warm water is almost soothing as it slowly slides over my chest. I reach down and start to soap myself off, letting the water start to run down and down, from my neck and down to my thighs and then to my ass. As I get closer to the washcloth I notice that I am still rubbing too hard on my ass. Not knowing what to do I pull the washcloth away from my legs and start to massage the muscle at its base. My hand is covered in my sweat, the soap still drying as I continue to work out the burn. I massage a little more, down into my leg area then back up. The water is still running down to the crack of my ass. I take the washcloth and place it near my hand and start to rub along my leg, with the soap. It feels so good! Rubbing the wet cloth over and over my leg and down my thigh I start to work at building the friction. I do this a couple more times then start to rub my other leg. I really want to turn my legs back to me but I don't dare. I continue to rub, but I don't want to take any more so I turn around to get the washcloth. I then take it away and start to turn to face the shower. Again I'm going to turn my body back around again and take the washcloth again to do that one leg, moving it up again to repeat this, this time working on the other leg, the water hitting my back and the soap sliding down.</p> <p>I start to feel the tension starting to build in my legs so I turn and face towards the shower wall letting the hot water beat on the back of my neck and shoulders. I can only imagine what is in the other room as I continue to work on my other leg. The intensity builds a little higher now and I am almost at orgasm as I continue to rub. I start to breath more steadily and have to take the washcloth away from my left leg to get the rest of the washcloth. The water is washing away the soap and I get up and move to my room. Just as I near the door I start to run to make sure they are both locked and that I am alone. I grab a towel and run back to the bedroom, then throw on my robe and lie down on the bed. I lay there quietly, waiting for them.</p> <p>I start to drift off to sleep. It is a dream, I dream a thousand times. I dream of one man...him...and his wife. Every so often I wake to someone rubbing shampoo into my hair and then moving my hair out of my eyes. At first I'm embarrassed at what I am feeling, so I take the washcloth and place it in between my legs while I am still trying to sleep. As I open my eyes I find them looking at me smiling. "How about you, sleepy-head?" I am so glad, because in my dream it is him. I sit there with my hands on my breasts thinking back to the first time we did this. He was wearing a little yellow bikini bathing suit. As a lot of people have known that he has a wife and a sister named Amy, he did his best looking to keep out the sun but it never did the trick. I love him so much. I can feel the water running down over both of us, and I look at him as he looks back at me.</p> <p>"How was your day?" I ask him.</p> <p>"Very well, I am going to go check on the car I saw yesterday." He says taking theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
