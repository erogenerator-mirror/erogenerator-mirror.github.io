For her it was all of this, but then, the whole situation just added, 'oh, it's okay, I'm here, I'm going to relax." She smiled at her own naivety, trying in vain to get into her place.</p> <p>'Now that you've got him, you've got me.' he thought. "And it is certainly okay, if you like? You were just as ready as I was last night, and I did my best to make sure that you got to relax."</p> <p>'I really do want some,' she thought, 'and I'll try to wait as long as I have to before I can get more out of it, it's been so long since I've had any.'</p> <p>Hugh turned back to the desk, and said, "Now that he's here, let's get him and some of this to drink with him."</p> <p>She walked out of the apartment looking so sexy that it made Hugh almost cum right there. As she walked, her shapely bare ass seemed to sway as she walked, a thin strap running down the back of her sexy ass. She walked over to her table without a word and said, "Well, thanks Mr. Harrison." She leaned over to kiss her student-friend, a bit too long for his taste. The kiss quickly turned into something more, and as her tongue went right in his mouth, she wrapped her arms around his neck.</p> <p>"So good in school." he said.</p> <p>She replied, "Well, you may be a professor, but you're definitely a teacher. But this is my first year and I've really enjoyed it."</p> <p>'I'm glad,' he thought. He just wished he were the one who fucked her into exhaustion. He had no idea she'd been this drunk, but there was no way she could hold back any longer. He decided to let her, not expecting she'd get her wish.</p> <p>She walked out of the dining room with quite a bounce in the small of her belly, and her ass swayed as she swayed like an excited bride. She couldn't wait to be alone with him. She went to the door, and opened it slowly as though she was being watched, almost in slow motion. She then walked to the study, and saw her professor just there waiting for her.</p> <p>Hugh walked through the door and said, "I'm sorry to have to interrupt you, but I have to speak to Mr. Harrison to set down the last of the drinks. I'm so sorry it took so long, but I really did enjoy your company." Hugh sat down with a nervous laugh, "That was one hell of a dance. I wouldn't have taken my drinks if it hadn't been for the way you were dancing with him."</p> <p>She asked, "Did you dance with Mr. Harrison?"</p> <p>He took a drink of his soda, "Yeah, I had to put my drink down, I've got a lot of paperwork to do today."</p> <p>"Well, can you take this to my room and get me my jacket?" she asked, "my dress is still a little bit wet, but I'll be right back."</p> <p>"Just remember, everything you do for me tonight is your business." he said. "I think you should have this evening to remember too." The class filed out without a word.</p> <p>Hugh was a little surprised that his teacher was so nice, but he'd only seen her in her underwear once. She told him she was a friend of a friend of an old boyfriend, and that she felt a little neglected in the classroom. This got him thinking, "I wonder what it would be like to see her in a bikini...but there may be plenty of ways we could do it."</p> <p>'I wonder what she would do, if I let it,' he thought, and had a thought that was right out of her pussy, for a moment. He decided that he would let it continue until later. Tonight, he decided to let it happen. He didn't have to wait for long, it seemed. She was standing in front of him again, leaning over to hand a cup of sugar to him, and holding it in as though it was an important lesson. This was much more than she had ever talked to him about. She had actually been kind to him, and never once put effort into trying to have an intimate conversation. Her attitude toward him was downright predatory. And now, he was going to see if she was into it too.</p> <p>"Did that feel any better?" he asked her with a smile.</p> <p>She looked away. "I guess it did, a little, but definitely not bad." She looked around for another drink, and then went to the kitchen again. She came back and handed his drink back to himâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
