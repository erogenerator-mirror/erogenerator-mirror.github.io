Finally breaking eye contact she glanced up at him again, her mouth hanging open and lips swollen and wet from her juices as she spoke with a voice that was barely audible.</p> <p>"Ohhhh God," she said.</p> <p>Sydney grinned to himself as he watched the beautiful redhead pull onto the highway the way she knew so well, her mouth full of him now. She took several long slow strokes, her mouth moving to capture about half of his hardness. She looked up at him and with a naughty smile pulled harder.</p> <p>"That's it, baby," she said. "You can do this. Feel me squeeze your cock, honey."</p> <p>For the next several blocks Sydney couldn't say a word of protest. With his eyes locked on Jessica's sucking lips wrapped around his shaft, he knew that she was right. If it wasn't for the fact that she had completely captured him, his reaction would have been to pull her face away and go back to the road. He couldn't help the disappointment written in his expression.</p> <p>"I love you," he smiled sincerely. His voice was as though it came from far away, almost out into the open. The sound of Jessica sucking on him was the real reason, not the illusion.</p> <p>"Thank you, baby," she said between deep breaths. "It feels so good to hold you." Her words seemed to resonate with him, and his erection remained hard and throbbing inside her as she pulled again to draw even more blood. Her other hand continued its gentle squeeze and his cock stayed as stiff as it was when she first started to move. She reached over her head and pressed just enough to be sure she didn't have to be careful, giving him a nice tight grip.</p> <p>"I'm sorry about that," she breathed. "I was just so excited." She turned her head and looked at him seriously. "Did this really happen?" she asked.</p> <p>"I've just been waiting all week for you to show up on my doorstep," he said. "And I've never seen you. I hope you're not upset."</p> <p>Jessica gave him a coy smile. "Not really," she said. Her expression didn't reveal much, but she spoke as if she didn't want him to know.</p> <p>"Not only that," she added. "Just for you."</p> <p>Jessica's hand released him slightly to let go of him and she leaned against the console as he reached over to kiss her. It wouldn't have done anything, but somehow it did make him feel more safe and secure inside her as soon as she closed the distance and pressed her lips back against his. Her mouth was soft and he could taste himself on her soft lips as she held on to him to keep from slipping back. It took more of her firmness to allow his hands to cup her butt and her legs to settle into the seat once more.</p> <p>"That feels really nice," she whispered into his lips.</p> <p>"Maybe you like it," he whispered back. "I haven't ever felt anything that nice inside my pants before." Jessica's hand began to gently knead his ass. He moaned into her mouth and pushed gently into her with his hips. Her tongue swirled across his, leaving small trails of saliva as she kissed him. She knew his cock was responding to whatever she was doing to him, and it was making her wet as well to allow her to touch him to full arousal. She pushed another finger into him just as he pushed forward against her.</p> <p>She felt the bulge and warmth of his hardness against her hand as he leaned into her for more. She pulled her finger from his ass to let her fingers caress him as she continued to kiss him. His mouth was wet and he kissed her again, this time with more pressure. Her fingers slipped inside him again, only this time in a different way.</p> <p>"I want you in my...," she breathed. Without hesitation she pulled her hand back as it began to move with a slow cadence. He moaned again as she stroked his hardness beneath his jeans.</p> <p>She moved down the car a little, so her breasts were in direct line with his chest and his hard-on was pushed up into her stomach. With her hand wrapped around him she pressed her mouth against him once more.</p> <p>"Mmmm...you're so hard," she whispered between kisses. "I didn't know I could make you feel that good."</p> <p>Hearing her words made him feel even more alive inside. He could feel his heartbeat rapidly picking up as she stroked and teased him under those intense blue eyes.</p> <p>"Youâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
