You said that if I didn't go now I wouldn't have done it!"</p> <p>"Not if I told you to come on in the morning! Don't fuck around!"</p> <p>"But you said: 'if I didn't go now I wouldn't have done it!'!"</p> <p>"Good! But I did say that. Then you might say 'no'!"</p> <p>I took a deep breath. But I really wanted to say so!</p> <p>"But I could have left then because I wouldn't be able to please you!"</p> <p>When we got to bed that morning Mandy was naked and on her back with her legs raised in the air – just like those of a cheerleader. I lay next to her and, to her, reached for the belt of the robe. She hadn't said anything else and my eyes were drawn back to her legs, which, when they parted, were quite shapely and sexy.</p> <p>I kissed my way back up her naked body and this time my tongue found her nipple. I sucked it – oh, so gently, then pulled its dark brown areole and her tit into my mouth, gently chewing its tip and feeling its erect length - before licking between her legs.</p> <p>Mandy's body jerked when I began to probe and, as I sucked and stroked between her legs I got my first look at her lovely pussy lips. They were so inviting and so red. I slipped two fingers gently inside the folds of her smooth lips – then I held my tongue flat against her clitoris and slowly dragged it up and down the shaft of her love-stick.</p> <p>"Oooh - yes!"</p> <p>I took one of her breasts into my mouth, gently squeezed and mauled it as I sucked the other. Inevitably she began to moan softly – perhaps with anticipation of what I knew would come later. She had told me earlier that it was her first time – that her husband's first time.</p> <p>"Come in me, honey. Come in me! Ooo! Oooo!"</p> <p>Her hips began to wiggle, rolling and writhing. Suddenly she gave a shuddering gasp of joy.</p> <p>"Oh, god - yes - yes! Oh, yes! Yes! Oh, yes!"</p> <p>Her orgasm was so strong that it nearly put me over the brink.</p> <p>"I think it's just about you! I just feel so good when I come!"</p> <p>Again she shook hard and the convulsions of her orgasm rocked her body as if it were in a seizure. For a brief moment I felt almost regret for doing it, but then I was too aroused to think of any other way of getting it off. It was just another one of the things that we wanted out of it: my revenge on that little girl! But that didn't last.</p> <p>This last orgasm was particularly strong – just for me! That way I had no chance of stopping it! She was still shaking and quivering when I slid my tongue into her and began to lick and suck her lovely pussy. My fingers probed and stroked her outer lips, rubbing and pushing together, spreading and flicking her clitoral tip.</p> <p>I sucked, and nibbled, kissing and licking her all through her last orgasm – and I got her to come once more! Then I felt the quivering and shaking of her body again and, now satisfied, she lay beside me, as I held her close and caressed her beautiful body.</p> <p>"No more! No more!"</p> <p>"No more! No more!"</p> <p>I had never been so excited before - even when Mandy had asked me to. In fact she had asked me to make love to her and let me have my way with her body. Somehow that did not seem too exciting anymore.</p> <p>"No more! Please... Oh...!"</p> <p>The feelings that I was still feeling after her orgasms were completely unlike anything I had yet experienced. I still don't recall if the excitement in her body as she lay there on the bed came from what I had just done or if she was just remembering it for what it was - or when!</p> <p>When Mandy started to rise and get ready for work Mandy was standing beside the bed. I couldn't tell if she was wearing an undershirt, or if she had an old pair of shorts. She had both of them on.</p> <p>"Oh! Oh! Ooh! Ooh! You are... Oh! You... Oo! Are you...?" she cried. All those sounds, all that beautiful feelings she must have been experiencing all those months, for me, were just one more thing from whom—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
