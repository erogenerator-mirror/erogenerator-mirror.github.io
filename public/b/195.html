I asked, wondering if this meant we'd get away with getting fucked...</p> <p>"We're in front of my parents' house, so... I got dressed, and we went to my grandmothers' house. They're expecting me about nine. I guess when I get home I'll be naked and ready to go, and I don't think you'll ever find out."</p> <p>"Ohh, sweetie," I said, "I'm sure you know, now, that you'll have to walk around the neighborhood naked in a few seconds."</p> <p>"What," she said, leaning over to kiss me again, "just be honest with me."</p> <p>"Well... how about this: you go in your room and shut the door with you hands, then come up to the front door, and come back out with that towel over your pussy and put the towel on the seat of your car. Make sure it doesn't fall out."</p> <p>"Okay, honey, if you say so, I'll be in school early!"</p> <p>"Okay, Daddy."</p> <p>****</p> <p>I went up to my room and locked, then opened the door, stepped inside, and closed the door, then locked it again. Again... and again. . .and the same.</p> <p>No, wait there . . . in the middle of the room next to my bed, sitting there was a little girl?... wasn't it, Daddy?... and she was standing there, naked, a few shades lighter than usual.</p> <p>A beautiful young thing, a gorgeous little girl with the same body and figure that I had always envied.</p> <p>"Hi, Daddy," she said, sitting onto the edge of my bed, looking at me with something that looked ... familiar, and suddenly, a little more comfortable wearing that dark, silky thing.</p> <p>"Hi, I'm Daddy," she said, leaning over and giving me a quick kiss, "now go back to class."</p> <p>"Daddy..." She said, looking over at me, as I stood there looking back down at her. "I'm not your typical young girl."</p> <p>I couldn't help but chuckle a little, too, just to be a little bit cool, though, or else this girl wouldn't let her father know, as she kept going over to my door, standing there in just a tiny red thong.</p> <p>My heart sank.</p> <p>"Daddy," she said, again reaching over, brushing the hair away from my face, "you're really nice to look at."</p> <p>I couldn't help but laugh, too.</p> <p>"Oh, no, you're not just nice; you're really beautiful. You really do look really much older than you've actually been, even though we've only been dating for a few weeks now. And I really think you've always been really beautiful. And beautiful, when you're dressed like that."</p> <p>"Mum, your blouse and bra aren't hiding anything, are they?" I said, looking over at her.</p> <p>Her eyes flashed back at me with a look of surprise, and her cheeks reddened.</p> <p>"No, no, I wasn't trying to hide anything from you, dear. I was just trying to get your name," I said, taking the little girl back to her school, taking her, like she wanted to be with me.</p> <p>"And, yes, I think you're really pretty, too," she smiled up at me, and stood there, looking over at the door, letting me look over her.</p> <p>*</p> <p>She knew what she was doing.</p> <p>Her hands were busy, too.</p> <p>She sat there, looking at me. Not saying a word, just looking at me...</p> <p>Finally, I said, very shyly, "I don't understand how you do this, mum. Why are you doing this?"</p> <p>She just sat there, looking at me and breathing.</p> <p>"I think, as you obviously did, that you're the reason I got to wear that. You like to look at me while you're changing, don't you? I'm so sorry if you think I shouldn't look, but I don't have to say it, since you've just been so, so nice to me, and I really didn't realise how much I was affecting your grades."</p> <p>*</p> <p>She sat there, looking at me, looking at me like I was made of glass, my hands just resting on my titsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
