She pulled her hand out from under the hem of her dress, and then reached to unfasten the front clasp.</p> <p>It took some time to work the dress from her shoulders, but eventually it was off. This bra went next as it fell open so easily to reveal her breasts in full, her nipples already erect, pointing straight up and erect. She cupped one breast with her hand and began squeezing, the other hand slipping onto the top of her thigh, reaching higher and higher. As she played with herself she could feel herself getting more and more excited. As her arousal grew still further she leaned forward, and as she did, her breasts parted, and she could feel her lips come together as she did so, pressing against her own lips, and letting her tongue find her nipple. It began to swell, and she closed her eyes whilst she enjoyed the feeling of an intense climax, her mind drifting back to the events leading up to last week, and feeling how much the memory has affected her, how much she really liked being married.</p> <p>At some point she realised that the mirror opposite was indeed turned on, and that she had been leaning back towards it, her eyes shut from the pleasure she had felt. She had opened her eyes only a few moments before, but the reflection showed her with her other breast exposed, her nipple pointing up from inside.</p> <p>She felt her pussy tingle with the excitement of being exposed in such a situation, especially with the way she was feeling right now, her own pussy starting to moisten in response to her mind's visual stimulation.</p> <p>She was still playing with herself whilst she felt her other breast being freed, then felt her panties being lifted over her bottom, then she felt a finger pressing on her pussy lips, spreading them wide, spreading them a little, pushing a little inside of her. She was enjoying her pleasure at the thought of being opened up, by both her own body and by her husband, and as the finger probed her, she could feel sensations going on from inside her own body, and it excited her, sending waves of tingly pleasure to her groin.</p> <p>It must have been obvious to anybody who was in the house or nearby that she was now completely drenched by her own juices as her finger began probing her pussy, feeling the wetness between her lips, pressing against her clitoris, her pussy making the wet patch at the front of her dress, feeling the slippery liquid there against her skin, the feel of her hand in the air where it was reaching out towards the heavens for all of her fantasies. The feeling was amazing, and her breathing intensified, her hands slipping down to hold her breasts firmly, feeling her own pleasure as the finger continued to stimulate her, and to bring about a whole of her fantasies.</p> <p>She looked up and saw her husband staring at her body. She stopped playing with her breasts and stared at him, then bent forward and, looking down again, looked towards his groin. He was still in his shorts, still very much aroused, as was she. She realised that she was smiling at him as her hands moved to unfasten her bra.</p> <p>At this stage she realised that she was still in her wedding dress - at least her panties were still on, but she was wearing the panties that had so entranced her the night before on. Her hand came up to cover the panties as she slid her other hand down between her legs. She opened her eyes momentarily to look at her husband, and saw him watching her intently, his face was expressionless, his expression a little uncertain.</p> <p>"Can I take this off?" she asked him as she looked round his face. He nodded a way of agreement, and she stood up to take the panties off, before turning round and bending down towards the mirror as she did so. She let her panties drop down her legs, stepping out of them, and then bent over again to pick them up.</p> <p>"May I?" she said to him, as she turned round, but not towards him. He nodded his agreement, so she placed the panties back onto the floor where they had been, and bent over again, her body now looking as though it was in her wedding dress.</p> <p>She looked up to see if she was being watched, and for a moment she imagined what it must look like - naked as usual, lying there showing herself to a complete stranger - her legs wide apart, her pussy lips open as she lifted her hips and lowered herself down onto the chair. She could feel her body tensing with the anticipation of what she hoped would come, which was only a couple of seconds.</p> <p>Just as she thought that she was finally able to relax down, a soft giggle from the side made her turn and see her husband standing inâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
