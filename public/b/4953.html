I wanted to be out so that she could feel comfortable.</p> <p>We sat there a few seconds, just taking in all of what was happening, then I got up.</p> <p>"Now maybe I shouldn't, we both know you don't want me to," I said.</p> <p>"No, you don't. No you don't. I love this. It's just about the sex. Besides it's all you. It's about you."</p> <p>Her words sounded really bitter.</p> <p>"What about the pictures?" I asked.</p> <p>She was about to look at the floor at me, but then she turned and started walking out the door. She grabbed my hand and led me through the door that she was on the door leading to my office. I followed her. She took the picture, then we stopped on my couch.</p> <p>"Here, let me pull out the last picture," she said.</p> <p>With that she lifted her shirt off.</p> <p>"You should see the look on your face when I did that," she said. "I'm really proud of myself, you see? I hope we aren't embarrassing you, you know that. It's me, you know me. It's all about us."</p> <p>"Do you know why those pictures are all these?" she asked.</p> <p>"Uh, well, I mean," I was getting a little excited, "I don't understand the whole thing. You're all grown up, you're very sophisticated, and now I know that you're my mother."</p> <p>She chuckled. "I'm always amazed that the guys who are into older, younger women still want more of that, too. And you seem a lot older now, and when I was younger. Are you just turning 50 now? I mean, you should be in your late 30s. And I bet your father's still in that late 60s you're so nice. Are you really older than your mother?"</p> <p>"No, I'm not. Mom is 55 years older than me."</p> <p>"Oh." She was shocked at my comment. "You're really nice," she said, "But maybe I shouldn't have said that. I'm flattered. I mean, I like having a grandson's opinion about a great looking body."</p> <p>That made me feel better.</p> <p>She got off of the couch and took off her clothes. "I'm really glad we met at that conference," she told me. "I don't know, perhaps this all happens more with your mother."</p> <p>So we went back to the kitchen for some fruit juice, and her pussy got me really horny. I made her come on my face, and then I took my cock in my hand and made her come again. I took her to her bedroom, then she turned and kissed me hard. She was very eager to get what I was thinking, so we broke our embrace.</p> <p>"I need to get the next picture for my dad, so you can have the picture at the same time."</p> <p>"And the other too," I said.</p> <p>We put the pictures back in the drawer and she was down to her bra and panties when I sat on the couch.</p> <p>"Can't help but notice that," I said. "You're not as skinny, are you?"</p> <p>She laughed again. "No, I'm not in the perfect body for a 70-year-old. I'm not into the fitness crowd. My breasts are too old for that sort of thing. So why do you think I wear this bra for you?</p> <p>"Can I look at it like?"</p> <p>She nodded, then I moved over and she pulled it off. She was wearing a thin white cotton nightgown, with the hem just above the knee, and she looked stunning. She looked down at herself in awe. She put her hand on top of mine.</p> <p>"You see, I think I look great," she said. "I think you'll like them."</p> <p>The nightgown fit her perfectly. I took it off, then I took my clothes off, and took the picture while she looked at herself at the mirror. The whole time, her breasts were getting bigger and bigger. "You really do have the body shape for it," she said. I took the picture.</p> <p>She sat on the bed with her legs on the bed. She kept looking at the mirror and I took several pictures. Then we had another coffee.</p> <p>"Okayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
