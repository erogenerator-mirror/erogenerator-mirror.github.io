"Are they as good as your photo pictures?"</p> <p>I thought about that for a moment. "I guess the ones that were all I could think about."</p> <p>My heart raced as she smiled again and said, "So why are you a good writer? What's wrong with you? You know you have a talent. You're not like any of the guys I saw online.</p> <p>This only made me more confused.</p> <p>"You aren't the same. You're definitely a young lady online. You are smart, beautiful and smart."</p> <p>"So what is all this about my being a young lady?"</p> <p>"Well first I just wanted to explain some things to you. The more I told you the more I realized that you wouldn't be that person online but you would know that you were very cute. You're sexy, and not only cute but intelligent and with that big, blue, blue eyes that seem to have two mouths."</p> <p>"A little too smart for my tastes." she said with that same smug grin.</p> <p>I was surprised by her use of language in this moment. I was starting to wonder why I hadn't met her before.</p> <p>"So where do I start? I don't want to talk about you. So stop with the questions. Let's get to the reason I am asking you this question."</p> <p>"Yes" she said before I could even stop her.</p> <p>"Well that's good because that's where this is going to lead. I want you to understand that you will be the star for my collection. I don't like having people reading the comments and then deciding what to do next from the looks of the comments." she started to walk away.</p> <p>"And if I don't like it, you can say you didn't like it and that you don't like it."</p> <p>I stopped her and asked, "What do you mean, if I don't like it?"</p> <p>She didn't answer. I wanted to change the way she was thinking.</p> <p>I tried to be even more helpful. "It's just that I need to tell you that I am looking at the pictures that you posted. You have a lot going on online, but your profile will be a huge hit from now on. It's a good thing the girls and you are always on the lookout for sexy models that can handle what I give to you."</p> <p>"What happens if I do something funny?" she asked, and at that second I regretted saying the words. Then she laughed, and started to walk out of the picture window. I quickly said, "No wait, I want to hear it..." and then I turned to pick up my phone.</p> <p>"Don't give anyone else's opinion like you have. If you don't like it, you can say you enjoyed it. But if I do it or if I do it, you can just tell me to stop."</p> <p>I took the phone and went to the chair in the other bedroom. It wasn't very comfortable but it was a first floor bedroom and I just took it to get the seat of my chair and laid it across my lap.</p> <p>"So what do you think?" I asked.</p> <p>"I think, I can make the pictures I just showed you look pretty good, and if you're sure they are ok, we can go further." She said with a wicked smile.</p> <p>"I'm sure I can make it look good, and that is without wasting a bunch." my little blonde lover replied, and then she added, "Let's make them look, and then make it sound as sexy as possible."</p> <p>I reached over and started to touch her thigh. This time it didn't stop me in my quest to please her.</p> <p>"I'll have to work on it. There is an interesting question for you." she said and started to run her fingers down its length.</p> <p>"What kind of question?" I asked.</p> <p>"That question is about the idea that if I show a woman I can make the pictures look better. You know that it's possible for anyone to look better than you do, because they are beautiful."</p> <p>"Oh, okay." I said. "Is that what you want me to do?"</p> <p>"You should do it. I want the girls to be happy, even if she doesn't."</p> <p>"So do you do anything else at home?" I asked knowing that was a hard one going for her.</p> <p>"No. And besides, I'm sure you don't want to see my pictures any more. I wouldn't want them getting old." She said confidently.</p> <p>She took the phone down and put it down between herâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
