I know we were meant to be together at this point."</p> <p>"I'm not blaming you," I said, "and it doesn't affect the way things are now, so you don't have to get involved again." I leaned in and whispered in her ear, "The thing you're afraid of is making sure you don't regret it later. You know how I hate when we do that."</p> <p>I was hoping she wouldn't go with me to the next step, so I had a quick thought.</p> <p>"You know that's not the case," I said quietly, "but if we could find someway to change things, then we can go for it."</p> <p>We talked for another half hour at the diner, and before anything else could happen we had exchanged all the dirty laundry that had accumulated since the last time we were together. I even took her over to another restroom to clean up, taking as much time as I could while I tried to do it. But when I got to the next door and started to knock, a minute or so later I was afraid she wouldn't knock. I heard her let out a deep breath before opening the door, and then she took a step aside.</p> <p>"Oh, you startled me," she said as her smile dropped, "come in."</p> <p>It was time for me to head over there and tell the entire group that I loved her and it wouldn't be the end of them going back to each other. The next thing I knew I was back in the diner looking for the right time to have a few drinks.</p> <p>"Is everyone still there?" I asked, "is there going to be a break?"</p> <p>"I think so," she replied as she closed the door behind me, "I think that you did a great impression of her, and I want to help you find your own way home. Have you had a chance to tell anyone about that little talk tonight, you know how I feel," she said with a smile.</p> <p>"I have, but I don't think even she does, unless she asks me," I said with a giggle.</p> <p>"Good thing then," she said with a smile, "you know her. You'll never know for sure though, she might be a good addition to the group."</p> <p>"She's pretty nice," I added. "I don't think this will be my first time here," I said, "and she seemed pretty enthusiastic about the whole idea. You might tell her after awhile anyway."</p> <p>"Who was that with my coffee this morning?" she said with a giggle.</p> <p>I had not even thought of the possibility of meeting her again on the subject of having a cup of coffee with her, but what I wanted to do at the moment was try to get her to try it.</p> <p>"A woman was in the restroom while you were waiting to make the coffee," I said quickly.</p> <p>I really hope I caught all her meaning, then I'm sure it would sink in if she did ask me to stop by. After all, the last thing I would want to do is go out of town on a night where nothing would really happen.</p> <p>"You're right," she said, "if you had stayed there for a while, then it would all have ended right then. No offense, but your husband's a lucky man."</p> <p>"No, not at all," I said, "and he never complained about anyone's opinions anyway."</p> <p>"That's quite true, but that is the point. Did you hear what she said about not getting me?"</p> <p>"Sure," I said, "but she's talking about how much she enjoyed seeing you naked and touching herself."</p> <p>"I don't think either one of us will care that you saw her either," she said as she turned and walked in front of me. I was in the process of trying to stand there and pretend she didn't come in, but when she did, she leaned down to kiss me right in the middle of one of the biggest, strongest orgasms I'd ever experienced. Then she was on me and we lay there for what felt like a long time.</p> <p>I was glad we would get a chance for a change in our lives at work after all and I told her she would have to stay if she wanted to continue doing her jobâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
