No way. But why should I just put up with it."</p> <p>"Please, don't. I want you to. I won't stand in your way. I don't think this is too much to ask. I'm not one of those women where some guy makes a quickie and then takes off to some unknown place to get laid. What if some guy makes a quickie over there? What then?</p> <p>"So, do you really want to know the answer?"</p> <p>I pulled her gently toward me and she fell into my arms. I let her lay on her side with her upper arm across my chest. She placed her hand on my stomach. She was trembling and seemed scared.</p> <p>"Are you sure that's ok?"</p> <p>"You know it's not. I mean, I've seen guys do it, but there wasn't a guy that I would have put my arm around."</p> <p>"I know, I just don't want you to get hurt. I don't feel safe here with you," I told her. She looked me squarely in my eyes.</p> <p>"I feel safe here with you. Why don't we stop right now?"</p> <p>I looked up at her. "Do you think I'm weird?"</p> <p>"No, of course not," she said. She was still shaking and her eyes were wet to the point of dripping.</p> <p>"How about we move?" I asked as I reached up and grabbed both sides of her head and gently pushed her face toward my chest. I wanted her to feel it for herself, not for me. I didn't want to do anything to her, but a new level of trust and comfort was coming.</p> <p>"Will you untie me?"</p> <p>"Of course I will."</p> <p>I let her have a moment to think. I didn't give a shit as far as the physical part of the experience. I was simply giving her a choice. As difficult as it was for me to see her as I was, a bit of freedom is what I needed.</p> <p>She leaned her head over and kissed my chest. This was just a small sample of how to go from sex to safe and pleasurable. I moved one hand down to her head and started to rub her temples. She felt so soft and tender as I went and pressed my hand to her temple. She slowly tilted her head up again and kissed my right ear.</p> <p>"What did you think?" I whispered.</p> <p>"I liked it," she answered after a moment. "My ears are very sensitive to different places. But it was different. I really can't describe it like that."</p> <p>"Do you want me to untie your arms."</p> <p>"No."</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Yes, what?"</p> <p>"Yes. I want you untied, so I can try to get as aroused as I can."</p> <p>"I want you to be nervous," I said with a note of exasperation in my voice. She was in no danger. I didn't know what to do. I didn't have a lot of experience with people like she would be. She was so much more of a woman than I had ever imagined.</p> <p>"Are you worried I'll hurt you?" she asked.</p> <p>"I'm ok in every sense of the word," I assured her.</p> <p>With the last few pounds of weight lifted off of her shoulders, she turned her head back to look me straight in the eyes. I grabbed her chin, pulled her face up to mine, and kissed her. This was an unexpected and unexpected experience. I wanted to take her into my arms and never let her go. "Do you understand?" I said quietly.</p> <p>"Yes... I understand."</p> <p>"Can I keep you all day?" I asked softly.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"Can I keep you all day?"</p> <p>She was still looking into my eyes and didn't answer.</p> <p>"Yes!" I said more forcefully.</p> <p>"I'm not in the mood. I want a kiss."</p> <p>She quickly knelt on her knees beside me, wrapped one arm around my neck, and pulled me toward her. She kissed me hard. I held her, and her hands ran up around my face as our tongues dueled. I grabbed her head again and pulled her mouth forward, kissing her all the way across my lips. I wanted to savour the taste of her as much as she had savoured mine. She opened her mouth to let me in, and I pushed my tongue into it. She responded by opening hers and letting me plunge it in. I pulled the other hand down and pulled her toward me, pulling her hips toward me. As our kisses became more passionate, she broke free of my holdâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
