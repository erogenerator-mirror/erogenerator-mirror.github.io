He stood up and embraced me. "You are so beautiful, and I'm so excited about this weekend." He pulled me in and kissed me deeply. It made me melt so easily. His arms were too strong, and soon I was wrapped up in him, not in anything.</p> <p>It would have been weird for me to get fucked by my new boyfriend. But we quickly fell asleep on top of the sheets, having just started a long day. We woke up the next morning with a kiss, and it made my heart soar.</p> <p>"I have a special surprise for you," he whispered, as he pulled me into his arms. "Let's go get something to eat." He kissed my lips and ran his hands along my skin softly, his hands roaming over it over and over again. I had my eyes closed and I could tell that I felt like I wanted to burst out of his mouth before he fucked me. What the fuck?!?</p> <p>We quickly changed out of our clothes and then grabbed and hugged each other, our bodies grinding together. We had no clothes and it felt like we were a little over-dressed in clothes from my first time that had been with a boy. We kissed more passionately than anything before, but it was like we were lost in a haze that was nothing more or less than an intense passion. This was so much more intense, and I started to grind my own body against his. My legs were shaking the entire time, and if I tried to pull away from it, it made me dizzy. A part of me started to lose control of myself and, in the end, I pulled him deeper into my body and the lust was boiling up inside of me. My pussy was throbbing with desire, and I moaned with pleasure every time his cock rubbed against it. God, it was so fucking incredible! I could feel every part of his muscular body, and he had a massive hard body. How could I be so ready to go again. I wanted to feel that every minute.</p> <p>I felt him push his body up and wrap his arms around me, and I melted as much as I was falling down. We pulled back and looked deep into each other's eyes as we kissed with that intense passion and desire that we had been building up to. His kisses were amazing and his hands were amazing. He pulled me up and started to kiss my neck, slowly working his way up to my breast. He could tell I badly needed to be with him that night and that I needed his touch. His hand continued to gently knead my breasts and he could feel how wet I was becoming.</p> <p>"I have to feel your lips on me," I whispered to him, as I grabbed his neck and moved my body towards him. It seemed like the moment for us had finally arrived, and we both knew that we didn't have much time. In the end we fell on the bed and he moved between my legs. He kissed my pussy softly and kissed it, letting it slowly get wet on his lips, and moved his tongue across it. He kissed it once more, as he reached over and put his hands on my breasts and started to massage them gently.</p> <p>He was kissing my pussy with a very intense intensity that I wanted more of. I felt like I should be able to go crazy for him like this, but I needed to concentrate on something else. I started thrusting my hips towards him, hoping to get more of his cock inside of me, and I felt that pressure building. He moved one hand down and placed it right at my pussy entrance, pushing it into my waiting canal, and starting to work it gently in and out.</p> <p>I felt the pressure building up and I knew my orgasm was close and we needed to be inside each other. After a while, I reached over and grabbed his cock and turned around so that I could ride him. I leaned over and we kissed each other. This was so very sexy!!! I felt his cock going inside of me, even through his pants. I wanted to be able to feel his cock inside of me, in me. I moved our bodies around to feel how that angle rubbed me. I grabbed both our cocks, and started to grind our bodies together again. As much as I needed some kind of contact, this guy's cock was making me so wet, I felt as though I needed something more. We finally finished kissing and laid back, enjoying all of the feelings going on our bodies. We were really getting worked up and I felt like we couldn't wait any longer and that we needed a shower.</p> <p>We got up and got in the shower and started to wash each other. We were both so turned on, we couldn't wait for more of each other. Without any barriers, we washed each other's entire body, paying special attention to all the places that made us feel as though we had done theâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
