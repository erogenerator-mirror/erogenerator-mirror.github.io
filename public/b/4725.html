He was aching for her, and his cock tingling and pulsing told him that he would be coming much sooner if he didn't stop being so hard, which he didn't want to do.</p> <p>Beneath him his erection throbbed and jumped into her body, the girl's breath coming in short, shuddering sighs as they shared the feelings they had just shared, and Jason knew from experience that he would enjoy watching her breasts and feeling them harden and become erect under his hands. It was a vision he could see every time he moved around to stroke his cock, or he would find himself on top of her, feeling the weight of her breasts against his chest and how hard her nipples seemed under his touch.</p> <p>She opened her eyes and found him still gazing again at her as he began to stroke himself, a smile on his face and an expression on his face as he moved back and forth above her. He watched her as she layed there, her breasts rising and falling against her chest, and when he began to move again, his legs stiffened and he held himself inside her, groaning again as she wrapped her arms around him.</p> <p>Jason's erection was straining in between their bellies and he felt himself harden as his cock pushed against inside her. His chest heaved as he thrust against her and his hips bucked in little circles as she moaned. He could feel the swell of her breasts pressing against his groin, felt her nipples hardening against his bare skin through the thin layer of skin separating them. Suddenly his thrusting faltered as he knew he should not be doing it - he could not take her - he simply couldn't - and he wanted to be able to hold out - both to her and himself.</p> <p>The girl turned her head up and looked at him, feeling a flush of embarrassment flood over her as she realised that he had just watched her being fucked. She shivered and whimpered and moaned as he drove himself further into her sex - he had just come and he was hard, he was leaking and he wanted her to know it as well, if only for her to do the same. She looked again at him, eyes full of wonder, her hands reaching up to grasp at the headboard as she lifted her body up slightly to thrust herself against his hard thrusting cock.</p> <p>"Is that OK - we know this is going to be OK - it's just... oh god yes - it... it feels so good -- it feels good inside me." Then she paused as if embarrassed.</p> <p>Jason had just come to find that the sex he had just had with one of the most beautiful girls he had ever known had almost made it difficult to imagine fucking another girl, and even though it had been with girls he had been with once - not a chance as he was still young and inexperienced - but not a girl he was very much in love with. He almost knew what she had in mind for him, but he knew it would be a gamble! He could feel the girl tremble in her arms as she tried to hold back her crying.</p> <p>His thrusting slowed in its intensity and he slipped out of her and lay beside her on the bed, gently stroking her hair back from her face as she lay there trying not to cry.</p> <p>"I - I didn't... I couldn't think of another girl... it wasn't right." The last said out of her mouth as Jason got himself together and sat up, his fingers automatically going to the side of her face which she had pressed against him. He smiled as he took in the expression on her face, her eyes closed and a small smile still on her lips.</p> <p>That wasn't what he needed, he had just been about to say 'please be happy with me, I love you' but then he remembered that if he had actually done this he might not have been doing this, that part of the truth was that it had been almost completely true.</p> <p>"Oh, thank you" he said " that was wonderful, and I love you!" He held his hand out to her.</p> <p>She took it hesitantly and looked at it as if it might vanish right in her face. Then the expression changed. "No, no no you don't" she almost shrieked " I just... I don't think I..."</p> <p>Still feeling that she'd said a lot of dirty things to him she sat up and turned to face him, and Jasonâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
