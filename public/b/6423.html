"Maybe we need to make a short stop, then make it back to campus in five minutes. Do you have any idea what you're going to do when I get back?"</p> <p>"You can't get to the campus," I said. "We'll need to use the back entrance and drive about fifteen minutes north. It's about a 45 minute bus ride."</p> <p>"Yeah, just as I thought," he said. "I can't find a way to get back to the campus without my folks knowing. They won't be home until tomorrow evening."</p> <p>"Don't worry, you'll find out by the weekend, alright," I assured him. "I'm going to go home straight after you, and let you get some fresh air before you go home. I'll be waiting for you on campus."</p> <p>The bus ride to campus was going to be very short, and we were only about seventy or so minutes from campus when we got off. The bus driver, an elderly white man with greasy hair and a goatee had just sat down. He gave us the name of a popular nightclub at some college in town, near the campus which was close to the main campus, and said he'd join us soon. I paid the driver and got up to my room.</p> <p>The bus drove away, and I followed on behind in the dark as we drove towards the center of town. We were about a quarter of a mile away when we got to the front door of the establishment. Our destination was a dark stone building with an obvious reason for me standing outside the door. I could make out my face and body, the man inside the door. He was tall with a broad face, well-developed looking muscles. His short black hair looked like it had been combed out, and his suit was all but unbuttoned in the middle. He had just taken his coat off, and his tie was loosened and hanging around his neck.</p> <p>"Hi, John," he said. "My name's Brian."</p> <p>The first thing he said was, "How did you know my name?"</p> <p>"I don't know," I answered. "I think you guessed that, anyway. Can I come in?"</p> <p>"Please," he said. "Come in here, please, Brian."</p> <p>He took his coat off, and I could see he had one hand in the sleeves of his jacket. The other was just in the front pocket, but at the same time it didn't appear to be any of my clothing. He was wearing a dark blue shirt and slacks, and was carrying an armload of clothes and a duffel and a small bag. His tie appeared like it was going to fall off when he stepped inside the door. He gestured as he walked past me towards the bar, and I stepped inside.</p> <p>"What can I get you, John?" he asked. "Can I get you anything?"</p> <p>"Yes," I said.</p> <p>"No Scotch, sweetie?" he chuckled.</p> <p>"No," I answered.</p> <p>"Then you'll have to order room service, then," he said. "Order some wine, and let's dance."</p> <p>"Ah, yes," I answered. "That would be nice."</p> <p>"Yes," he said. "I'll get that for you."</p> <p>As I was about to turn around, he said, "Go ahead, honey. Order me a drink."</p> <p>I turned around to give him the glass in hand. He handed me the glass and said, "Take that to the bar. If you're thirsty, let yourself in."</p> <p>"Thank you, Brian," I said and walked back out to the bar.</p> <p>A few minutes later, as I got back in the bar, John walked up to me and said, "Is there a problem with the bathroom?"</p> <p>"Sure," I answered. "I'm not upset about the bathroom!" With that, I returned to the bar and ordered another drink. This time, though, he handed me the glass, and we continued the conversation at the bar.</p> <p>After our drinks arrived, we continued talking about the university, where we were from, and the various projects we were working on.</p> <p>"What happened to that old lady?" I asked.</p> <p>"She's in the hospital," he answered. "She beat a bloody hell's blushing in the front yard today. She might have given blood if she let me get her."</p> <p>"I'm sorry," I said. "That was all pretty stupid of me."</p> <p>"Well, she doesn't seem to have any problems with it, do you?"</p> <p>I wasn't exactly sure what toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
