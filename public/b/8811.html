I slid a hand down her belly to her mound and massaged her lips with my fingers for a moment. I felt her begin to open her legs for me and I slid a finger inside her. She was aching and trembling and she moaned as I slid another finger inside and started to massage the spongy head of her clitoris with the fingers of my other hand.</p> <p>Sue's body was already shaking as I finger-fucked the older woman and I could hear her moaning as the sensations that were building inside her intensified. Suddenly Sue's face was in my shoulder and she pulled me over her so that we were spooning. Our breathing was harsh and raspingly as we breathed each other quietly.</p> <p>"Come on, fuck me," Sue whispered.</p> <p>I had my cock in her hand as she slid a third finger inside herself and the excitement of the situation and the feeling of being with Sue was almost too much. I pushed her down against the bed and climbed on top of her. My erection was pressed firmly against her naked pussy and Sue groaned again as I spread her open with one hand and thrust forward with my other, shoving my way into her depths in one move. Sue gasped and moaned as I penetrated her again and pushed all the way into her with one stroke, sinking my full length inside her. I fucked her slowly as our bodies pressed together.</p> <p>We made sweet love, our bodies pressed together as our bodies pressed against each other. Sue moved her hips upward in a gentle counter rhythm as my cock drove into her. She made soft, contented sighs.</p> <p>After about a minute or more, Sue said, "I want to come before I have an accident."</p> <p>"What's wrong?" I asked, my heart pounding in my chest as I held myself inside her tight and waited to see what Sue was thinking.</p> <p>"It's my tummy. It hurts. It's going to get worse."</p> <p>"You can still get it if it starts to get painful. And if you want to stop, just tell me when to stop."</p> <p>Sue squeezed her arms tightly around me while she lifted her legs high and pushed herself up with her heels so she could get as deep and firmly as she could into me.</p> <p>I leaned into her, my hands in her neck and breasts, her back and side as she fucked herself into me. I could feel my cock throbbing inside her and I was surprised that it didn't hurt as much as once I got close to coming. I could also feel Sue's wetness as she squirted into the sheets below and she was moaning loudly now, trying to get the pleasure she wanted from our lovemaking. I leaned down and kissed her lips.</p> <p>Sue's fingers were already in her pussy again as I kissed her neck, licking inside with soft, firm flicks of my tongue. I pressed my lips against hers and she groaned and opened her mouth so I could reach inside for her tongue. When I slid the tip of my tongue against her lips, she gasped loudly and then started to come. I held my lips and sucked her tongue until the spasms passed then I pulled my mouth away and sucked her nose between my lips. With my lips clamped tightly over hers, I kissed her, tasting the salty pre-ejaculate on her mouth.</p> <p>"That was so good." I said.</p> <p>"That was just what I needed." Sue said. "Oh, God, I was so horny. I could come anytime, anytime at the club. But it gets very complicated."</p> <p>"I can see that," I said, still kissing her lips. "I'll stop if you want me to."</p> <p>Sue kissed me again and lay back on the bed with her head at my side, still holding onto me and still whispering, "Take me to the club tonight."</p> <p>"I don't have time to take you there." I said.</p> <p>"Oh, I want and I like the things we got to do at home, but we'll do it again."</p> <p>"Well, I might call you again."</p> <p>"Of course," Sue said. "Tomorrow, when you get back to your work."</p> <p>"Maybe," I said, "we'll see."</p> <p>Then I was on my side beside Sue with my hand on her back again as we continued to kiss.</p> <p>"Are you sure?" I asked quietly when it became obvious that Sue was ready to continue the conversation that had been building in the evening for her.</p> <p>"I don't have anywhere else to go now. I'm going to bed."</p> <p>"You didn't even bring a night jacket," I said, "and you didn't even need one!"</p> <p>"Well, you could always come with meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
