"Mmmmmmm." She pressed her lips against his, pressing his hard shaft against his stomach. "I love it when you're like this." He could feel her lips slip down further, opening her mouth and sliding his throbbing length inside. "Jesus, Emma, you're making me crazy. You are so beautiful." He moaned. "That's it, Emma, do whatever you want with this." His hips thrust, as if pushing something into a hole, forcing its way deep inside. "Emma, I'm about to come," he warned.</p> <p>"Then cum for me." She moaned, taking him deep into her mouth. Her tongue snaked around him, tasting every inch of him. She took him in her hand, massaging and kneading his balls with her other. She made love to him, stroking every inch of him, savoring every taste. His head fell back, moaning. "Oh, Emma," he gasped. "I'm coming." She sucked his cock, trying to swallow every drop of him. She pulled back. "God, Emma," he moaned. "That was..."</p> <p>She grinned. "Fuck," she said. "I knew you'd love it." She slid off of his cock and led him to the side of the bed. "Lie on your back, Jack," she told him. "Fuck you, Emma." She took his hand, guiding it to her pussy. "Please," she whispered. "Come for me, baby, fill me up." She was already soaking. "Please, Emma, I'm begging you." He took her clit in between two fingers, rubbing it in gentle circles. "Oh fuck, that feels so good." Then, suddenly, she moaned. "Oh Jack, I'm coming." Her hips bucked. He took her, fucking her for all he was worth. She came too, crying out his name in a mixture of bliss and joy. Her legs gave out and she fell onto the bed.</p> <p>He rolled over, gasping for breath. "Emma, that was wonderful."</p> <p>She smiled, reaching for his face to wipe the tears from his face. "Thank you." She sat up. "Jack, you've been a fabulous lover." Her hand rested on his stomach, as she brushed her hair out of his eyes. "I'm so pleased." She laid back down next to him. "You don't come without me." She kissed his lips. "Jack, do you still love me?"</p> <p>It was difficult, having something go so wrong between them, especially so soon after the experience of the previous night. "That's easy, I admit. It's difficult for me to say the words. I... I feel something special. That's all there is to it. I want more than anything for the rest of my life." He put his arm around her, holding her close. He could feel her breathing again, ragged and heavy. "I'm sorry I left, Emma. But I want you again, I want us to be together again, and I want more than anything for the rest of our lives." He started to kiss her. "There's something I'd really like to tell you." He held her close, feeling the heat of her body pressed into his own. "Emma, I really have to tell you something. I'm not sure if it's been a long time since I've had any sort of sex with a woman. Can we keep that part of our relationship a secret? Can you still feel the affection I still feel for you? No matter how long we live together, I can't tell if I'll ever get over the fear that I can't love you. It would ruin my future."</p> <p>Emma looked him with a loving, trusting expression. His eyes glowed. "Jack," she said, moving over him. "I have something to tell you as well. When you're ready for your first real fucking, I'd love to take your virginity." And then, she kissed him, hard. "I can't wait to feel you inside me again."</p> <p>It was a difficult moment for both of them, lying there afterwards, his head on her breast. Finally, his eyes were a little riddder, but even at that, their intense hunger returned. He could tell it would be tricky. "I have a confession to make. I'm not sure I've actually had sex with anyone in the past thirty-six years. Maybe that's been happening to me before." He shook his head. "It's been with me a dozen times. I've never been with a girl."</p> <p>Emma smiled. "But you can have a girlfriend if you want."</p> <p>"No, no," he insisted. "I'm not having sex againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
