I pressed my lips hard against his and moaned softly, he looked up into my eyes as he continued working on my mouth with his lips. He moved his lips down over mine and we kissed and licked each other's mouths and our naked bodies. I ran my hand over his cock and felt it, he pushed me back and broke off the kiss.</p> <p>He smiled, took my hand and led me to the bed, he lay on his back on the bed and beckoned me toward him. I sat on the bed beside him and he wrapped his arms around me. He ran his hand down my back and reached inside my skirt. He pulled me forward so I was straddling his stomach and then slowly reached around my body to unsnap my bra. He pushed it away. I bent down to get at it and saw a look of lust cross his face. He rubbed his fingers in the moisture on the side of my panty, then rubbed back up my chest, down my neck, down my chest slowly. He ran his fingers over my nipples and I could not hold on any longer. I leaned forward and took one into my mouth and he kissed my ear and then, I ran my tongue over his nipple. He pulled me down and I felt his tongue running over my nipple. I moved down his body to where my face lay between his legs. I kissed my way down his stomach and legs to his feet. I kissed the inside of each in turn. I worked my way back up his legs and back to his nipples, taking each into my mouth and rolling over them with my tongue. I teased him with my tongue and fingers for a few moments, until his moans gave me indication of an approaching climax. I moved around the bed until I lay beside him, kissed his lips gently and ran my hand down his chest.</p> <p>"Will you let me do this, please?" he asked. I grinned and told him "Of course, I could never hurt you, I love you." He smiled and kissed the tip of my nipple. "I love you, too," he said and kissed my nipple.</p> <p>I turned and lay on my back and slid him on top of me and kissed and licked his stomach. I worked my way down and he moaned as my fingers trailed over his cock. I began to squeeze and fondle it. He pulled me up to him and I kissed his face, cheek, and neck as I gently stroked and stroked him with my fingers. I felt his hand grasp my breast with a tight feeling that I had never felt before. I could feel the heat of his cock and he worked his cock into my hand. I moaned when he entered me. He moved his hips faster as he began to slam into me, harder and harder each time. My hands were working furiously on his cock, my mouth worked on his nipples. I could feel the tension building, he grabbed the back of my head and pulled my mouth to his chest, thrusting his cock deep in my body.</p> <p>"I'm here, I'm going to cum," he said and I looked up at him.</p> <p>"Uh-uh-uh. Oh, yes come for me! Do it. Doit"</p> <p>"Yes!, Yes, cum for me, fill me, fuck, cum." I cried out as his cock jerked inside me and my body bucked uncontrollably. He pumped himself harder and harder and I felt his cock swell and then his head explode as he buried himself inside me. His muscles contracted as he began to pulse inside me and I cried out at the same moment. The feel of him filling me with his cum was both electric and electrifying. It seemed to last forever and was incredible. I wanted to do it all again, I wanted to make him feel as good as he had done to me. I wanted to taste him and I wanted to have him and I wanted to lick every drop of cum from his cock.</p> <p>We lay on our bodies, his cock softening in my cum covered grip. I looked at him and he smiled and ran his hand over the tip of my nipple. We kissed and then I rolled over, he pulled up my skirt so I could lift my hips so he could pull off his clothes and we lay naked on my bed.</p> <p>"That was...awes...incredible, was it incredible?"</p> <p>I looked at my lover so many times, I couldn't tell if he looked back or not and I was suddenly worried that I did not understand what they wanted me to wear. "It was incredible," was all I could get out again.</p> <p>He slid off the bed onto his knees and reached down to my thigh. He ran his hand up my leg from my knee, it seemed only my stocking top remained between him and me, I could feel it, I felt it when he touchedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
