"Let's see what he's like before you do something to me." She turned her tongue around in my ear and rubbed against my clit again. I moaned and her hand slid to the back of my thigh and began its slow exploration. Her thumb pressed in and the sensations spread through my entire body. My knees buckled and she held me like a ragdoll. I moaned in frustration and I pulled on my arms.</p> <p>"I want you to fuck me," I said as I turned and lay on my back. I reached down and ran my fingers over her legs as she lay on top of me. "Please...." I whispered to her, pulling her down on me. We fit together as her breasts pressed against my side. It was her turn to moan. Her head bobbed up and down so I let it slip between my breasts. My hands wrapped around hers and I pulled them off my side and moved mine up to her. Our fingers tangled and my fingers tightened.</p> <p>"I need you to suck me," I said and pushed a finger into her. I closed my eyes and opened my mouth as she slid the head back and forth over my lips. She closed her eyes and I slipped one finger into her. I could feel her clit growing from the tightness of her canal and she began to move against me. She whimpered and her body seemed to be begging for more.</p> <p>"Please," she said. "I want my clit sucked. I need it sucked." She pulled her body up and kissed me. I licked her nipples and ran my tongue over the hard nub. Her whole body arched and my hand tightened around her. I slid my hand down to rub her clit but pushed it away.</p> <p>"No" She said. "I just need it. Please...."</p> <p>"It's not yours...I don't want it," I said. "I want to see you cum."</p> <p>"You don't have to make me cum," she said softly. "Just leave me alone for a moment." Her body tensed and her head went down with a little laugh. She pulled back and smiled at me as I watched.</p> <p>"I am yours now, lover," she said as she pushed herself up to a sitting position. "You do what you will. I am yours." Her voice was ragged and her words were breathless. "Just kiss me." A bit of sweat broke out on her forehead and her eyes were glowing.</p> <p>I did as she asked and kissed her. She kissed me back with abandon. Our tongues danced and I felt the tension of our bodies building. Her hands cupped my breasts and gently rubbed me up against her nipples. They were as soft as I remembered them. She lowered her lips and licked the tip of each one before running her tongues around it. She bit on her lower lip and held her breath. Finally, she slipped her lips over hers and licked slowly, savoring the taste of me.</p> <p>When the kiss ended she laid her head on my head. Her hand slid down between us until she touched each nipple and circled it. I pulled her fingers to my mouth and sucked them. I felt them become hard and ache with their own need. I pulled her closer to me and she lay her face on my breasts. She ran her teeth and lips over me gently. Her tongue darted in between them. I felt my pussy grow even wetter as I heard her moan.</p> <p>"I know what you want," she whispered. I moaned and leaned my head back. "I want you right here." She kissed me again and ran her tongue down and between my lips. She pressed my head back with her free hand and slid into me again with a smile. I pressed my hips together and moaned again. She ran her long fingers along my labia and slid one inside me. I wrapped my legs around her and pulled her deeper into me.</p> <p>Her mouth was warm and wet on my lips and cheeks. "You like that?" she asked as she moved over my face again. I moaned when she moved again. "You like being fucked?" she asked again, and her hand started working my clit as she lowered herself to me again. "I want to be yours," she said again. "I want to be your woman." She moved her tongue over my clit and slid her tongue inside me again. My pussy muscles tightened around her hand as her tongue moved faster insider me. Her eyes locked onto mine as she worked her tongue in and out of me and her lips pressed against me. I was close to cumming when she stopped long enough to roll over, pull her up to her and kiss my breast.</p> <p>"Mmmmm, I like it when you get close," she murmured. Before I could say anything else she kissedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
