He offered to take her home, so she could see him when she returned to her apartment.</p> <p>"Okay, see you in a little bit, dear."</p> <p>She nodded, and she got in her car to take off.</p> <p>As she left the parking garage, she saw her door open, and she walked in. Her back was to the door, but inside the door of her apartment she saw his eyes, so her own got bigger; her face turned bright red.</p> <p>She walked inside and slammed the door closed, turned around, and gave him a hug and a kiss, feeling his breath on her mouth.</p> <p>"Hi." He breathed. She felt his strong arms around her at the same time, and her heart jumped in her chest, she had to catch herself before she kissed him again.</p> <p>"Hey there." She smiled. She stood next to him as he stepped around her in his arms, rubbing her shoulders.</p> <p>"I feel warm." She looked up at him. "Let's go make a nice hot pizza, then we can go home and have a nice dinner."</p> <p>"Okay" He put his arm around her as they walked down the hallway.</p> <p>They went to the fridge, and she grabbed some pepperoni, cheese, mayo, garlic, and onions. They sat on a stool, and she opened a bottle of wine, he placed something else as his hands ran through her hair; she loved it.</p> <p>"Wow, you still smell like strawberries." He said, running his finger down her cheek. She tilted to look at him. His eyes lingered on her face a moment longer before they turned to her. They stood gazing at each other for another short time.</p> <p>"Do you like the clothes?" He asked. "The blouse?"</p> <p>"Yeah, they're nice, and it's not too revealing." She sat at the table, and put the last of the food back in its container.</p> <p>"I like the way it looks on you." He pulled out the shirt that was the dress shirt. "What should we do now?" He put the box of the shoes inside his chair.</p> <p>"I don't know. I still don't know what I want to do." She stood. "Let's eat here, I'm hungry."</p> <p>He nodded, and got up. He opened the fridge, and she stood, she sat down quickly. He brought out the food and placed a plate in front of her, and then sat back down at the bar.</p> <p>She ate quickly, and was surprised by the fact that she liked to eat fast. It felt good with dinner, which she had wanted with a long wait.</p> <p>After they finished the food, they sat there for a minute, eating. He got up and stood next to her, placing a napkin on her lap.</p> <p>"I'm going to go to my room." He kissed her on her cheek. "Enjoy your evening, and enjoy yourself."</p> <p>*</p> <p></p> <p>We hope you enjoyed this chapter of my story.
