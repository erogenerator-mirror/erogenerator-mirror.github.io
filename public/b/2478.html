"Show her, show her how you feel," She instructed.</p> <p>I stood there watching Her as Her eyes began to glow red from the shower. Her lips formed into an even smile as She slid them off of mine. She then turned on the water spraying a small pool of water at my foot.</p> <p>She leaned over, She grabbed Her hand and slid it down to my balls. She held My dick in Her fingers. "Do you like it?" She asked as She rubbed over them in the water.</p> <p>"Oh yeah, I love it, It feels so warm."</p> <p>"Then we'll get it warmed up some, shall we?" She asked as She turned to walk toward the shower and stepped in one of the oversized glass cubicles in front of the tub.</p> <p>I slid my feet into the tub and spread my legs up against the edge. Leaning back against the wall, I closed my eyes so i wouldn't have to see what was going to happen next as She leaned forward placing the palms of Her hands on my thighs. My body jerked slightly from the slight pressure as She slid Her hands towards my balls. She held them in one hand and wrapped Her fingers around them. With Her other, She slowly began wrapping Her lips around the head of my dick.</p> <p>"Are we going to do this here, or do you want to get more comfortable?" I heard</p> <p>I heard My heart skip a beat as She continued to suck my dick in and out while her hands gently massaged the head. I slowly began moaning. She opened Her lips wider and began sucking and licking the length of my penis, sucking down as far as she could with one hand, then swiping Her tongue rapidly along the underside of my member.</p> <p>With one hand, She grabbed my ass cheeks pulling me closer to Her so I could feel my cock in Her hands, Her lips still encase my dick. I could barely say a word as my heart began pounding in my chest. My hands began to move over Her shoulders, Her head bobbing up and down faster and faster.</p> <p>My dick began to throb with the need for release. My hands began to go in small circles as Her hands wrapped around the base, then she pulled back and slid her tongue along the underside of the head. As my breath became shallow, She began stroking my cock, while still sucking on it. I could barely take it anymore.</p> <p>"God yes," I cried out. "Fuck me, Fuck Me."</p> <p>She continued to suck</p> <p>"Mmm," She moaned.</p> <p>I felt a huge wave of pleasure rush over me as she continued sucking on my dick. Her hands began massaging my sack as she slowly slid Her mouth up and down on it. Her tongue began to dance on the very tip as She pressed Her tongue against the head. She slowly slid Her head until her mouth was just about halfway up my shaft. My legs began quivering.</p> <p>"Are you ready to cum, baby?" She asked as She held my dick.</p> <p>"Yes, please, I am so ready to cum."</p> <p>I felt her head move back off of my dick so I was again leaning against the wall. Leaning my head back against the wall, my upper body was beginning to bounce. I could feel my cum building up in my balls. As She pressed up against me, She placed one hand around my shaft and began sliding it up and down to the base of my dick while she used her other hand to rub my balls.</p> <p>"I'm going to cum," I cried out, "Oh God!"</p> <p>I could feel streamers of orgasm hit the ground in front of me as The pleasure continued to pulse throughout my body. Her hand continued to slide up and down my cock as I had a powerful orgasm.</p> <p>"Oh God" I groaned, "That’s it, Oh God."</p> <p>She began sucking as fast as she could, my dick throbbing in Her mouth as she continued to rub against my prostate.</p> <p>"That is so nice," I said when I felt The orgasm starting to subside.</p> <p>"Yes baby, Yes," She continued, I could still hear the slight slurping.</p> <p>I could feel her hand begin to shake. I could feel The pulse in my legs increase. I was getting very close.</p> <p>"I’m going to cum" I cried out as I began to feel My dick swelling.</p> <p>"Yes," She said as she pulled off my dick.</p> <p>She lifted her head up from my dick and turned to speak.</p> <p>"I have never cum like that before," She said as she grabbed my cock and pumped it.</p> <p>"You’—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
