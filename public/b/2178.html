The water felt so good against his throbbing cock he didn't care. He had been fantasizing about this for so long....now she was taking her time, he was hers. He stood up, grabbing her hips he pulled her up to his and kissed her passionately, licking her tongue with his. He was so turned on by the kiss that it was all he could do not to pull her in against his swollen cock. His cock throbbing against her bare pussy as it pressed up against her. He felt his head push against her. With her now resting against the wall he pushed up into her, grinding his hips into hers.</p> <p>She could feel every hard and throbbing inch grinding up her. She could feel his cock as it slid past her pussy lips into her love tunnel.</p> <p>His hand reached up and caressed her breast through her robe. His other hand came up, rubbing her nipple sending chills up her spine. When he pinched it she let out a gasp of pleasure. He leaned into her, his mouth capturing hers again. While they were still locked in their kissing they heard the door bell ring.</p> <p>Hurry the fuck up you fucking bastard.</p> <p>"Oh, you got me good buddy." She growled.</p> <p>Her hand was still massaging her tit and her nipples throbbed through her robe.</p> <p>"We're closing up." He yelled to the door.</p> <p>They both jumped from their seats and hurried from the theater.</p> <p>"Damn, look at that woman walking around the house. I had no idea they could go this long." He yelled to her.</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess I do." She responded.</p> <p>He got a good grip on her hips. He wanted her to follow him around and feel his hard cock plowing into her from the other side of the room. He wanted to feel her on his rock rock hard cock, feel his cock going in and out of her wet pussy. A wave of excitement washed over him as he got his full erection back to its full erection.</p> <p>"Can I show you the way to the back?" She pulled herself up off her knees.</p> <p>"Sure."</p> <p>He followed her down the stairs and she guided them into the back of the theater. He felt her hand on his back; she guided his hand down to her ass and led him down the center aisle. He found himself behind her again. He grabbed her ass cheeks and squeezed it and moved his hands around to her clit.</p> <p>God he was going to fuck her hard. This was gonna be so fucking great.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" She asked him.</p> <p>He was shocked at how nervous she sounded; he was shocked that he actually wanted to do this. He didn't know what to say at first.</p> <p>"Just don't take it the wrong way."</p> <p>In a soft tone she replied, "You want me to come on to you?"</p> <p>He had already begun to get excited from getting a hold of her ass. He wanted to fuck her so bad but he wasn't sure if he knew how.</p> <p>"What?" She asked, almost surprised.</p> <p>"Just don't take it the wrong way." The look on her face said it all.</p> <p>He stepped around in front of her and lifted her in his arms.</p> <p>"So...are you gonna let me do that, or would you prefer me to just do what I did with your mouth?" He whispered into her ear.</p> <p>As her head was pressed into his neck, she was almost breathless with excitement. He gently lowered her to her knees on the floor in front of the couch. He pushed his cock out and rubbed it up and down her lips, rubbing it over her lips and making her take a deep breath.</p> <p>"Open your mouth for me."</p> <p>With one hand he rubbed the head of his cock up and down her lips. He felt her tongue flick out at it every time it brushed over it. He was still in a daze from what she was doing to him. She leaned herself closer to his cock. They both could smell the scent of him. It was the odor of wetness and hot excited pussy. They were both now more turned on by the erotic atmosphere of the moment than they could have ever imagined.</p> <p>Slowly he pushed himself fully into her. She let out a moan of pleasure as he did so. Slowly he pulled his dick out of her mouth, allowing her to catch her breath. When he had it out about halfway he pushed forward a bit and slowly slid it all the way back out so he was able to go a bit further into her with a couple of short strokesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
