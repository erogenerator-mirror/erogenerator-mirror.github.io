We know it, too. You know me well enough to know it."</p> <p>He looked from one to the other, his eyes flickering from the road to the car. "I'm going back to work. I've got the papers with the papers you signed. You can go back to your apartment – I'll meet you at the front door – or come inside."</p> <p>The first words spoken since they started up this conversation were "You're right. I forgot. I'd rather come home now." He was being too demanding by not having his own place. He wanted to stay in his apartment – he wanted to have one – and be sure it was comfortable.</p> <p>He looked at the screen. The day was late and all day at work was dragging by. He wasn't looking forward to his job. He could tell by the expression on the face on the screen. "What are you doing, sweetheart?" was the question.</p> <p>"I'm going home to see my daughter."</p> <p>Grateful, he asked, "And what do you want me to do?"</p> <p>"Don't you know what you want to do? You want to be the one who makes the weekend. And what you want is not what I want. Get over your embarrassment. Do something to relax the tension. Take a shower, then go to bed."</p> <p>He was not being unreasonable, and wanted her to do it, too. If he had wanted her over his desk, she was out of his life – and he wasn't going to lose her to some sleaze bag. But he wanted his house, too. He had decided not to buy an expensive place once he moved back into his house. He didn't think it'd get fixed any time soon because of that. But he did plan to move back home. But now – after work – he thought it would be better to not work all day. So tonight, he'd just rent a condo.</p> <p>With every step toward the door that night, his mind played with everything he remembered. He thought about the girl he'd slept with that first time. Did she know it was him he wanted to have sex with, if he'd had the chance? Did she know he was willing to fuck her? Or would she be happy to have sex with him? He didn't know, but he didn't care anymore. He went to bed.</p> <p>---</p> <p>In the past, Jim had spent most of his Saturday nights watching his movies. Now he sat there for hours on end, watching some romantic romantic movie and having a bowl of popcorn – something he didn't normally do. His mind wandered to his new home-cabin and his fantasies of her.</p> <p>He thought his wife still didn't care that he was still seeing her, as much as she had gotten in bed with him when no one else was present, at least none who was familiar. But the thoughts kept returning. Why else had he bought himself a keychain? Was it to be a deterrent? Did his body have more power than to just think about it anyway?</p> <p>He didn't answer any of those questions.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Jim woke from a deep sleep by the sound of the kitchen. He saw a strange shape and figured it was the clock in the living room. He sat up and looked around. There were no towels in the bathroom – they must have gone into the bedroom since he didn't want to wake her up. The closet was open, and the bed was empty.</p> <p>Then a memory flashed in his mind. He got up, walked into the kitchen to check the clock – just as she'd asked him. Sure enough, she was standing right in the middle of the kitchen, smiling and carrying a couple of small cups and bowls around with her as though she were in a hurry. The bowl was empty. She was naked, and he was naked too.</p> <p>"Is this where we are going for breakfast today, honey?" he asked sarcastically. Then he looked around – she was still standing, in front of him – completely naked. She'd had a smile on her face.</p> <p>He didn't answer. She'd asked him to call her the night before, so her body was available. Instead, she answered his question by kissing him on the lips, then in a longer kiss than usual. No tongue, although, as he'd had in the past, she seemed to love it.</p> <p>"Have you made breakfast for me yet, honey?" she asked coyly.</p> <p>"I'm having breakfast with you while we watch the news," he told her truthfully.</p> <p>"How did you know when it was going to be breakfast for me?" she teased.</p> <p>He chuckled.
