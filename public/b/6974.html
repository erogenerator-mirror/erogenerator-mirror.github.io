I smiled. I wasn’t feeling quite so brazen now, I thought. I was sitting in a large, luxurious, high-decorated lounge sofa, with a couple of old, recliner chairs arranged around a narrow table. The place felt like a very expensive set-up, with a huge glass sofa against one wall and a single chair at the other end of the room. In front of me was a huge window, one of the largest in the house. It looked at least three stories tall, from the floor to the ceiling almost to an imposing table, which was situated half-way up the window. The windows were high-bolted and high, and the glass looked out toward the street as well as out over the river, which the houses and cars in front of them were far too crowded for anyone to see directly in them. They had also added a goodly foot or two of height to the patio. The only lights were from the street outside and the street in front of the house. There was no traffic around the place.</p> <p>I had no idea what kind of a place the villa really was. It’s inlet was maybe six or seven square feet, and it looked about five times the size of the villa, but most of the villas were in the back of the property. The villas were built much as I had hoped and had balconies all along the front porch; this had been the most expensive home in the house ever built. There was a small bar where we served white wine and a couple of small bistros on each wall of the lounge sofa. The curtains around the windows were closed, and I could see the sun streaming through them as it passed over the house. There were a couple oaks and brambles in the garden beside the verandah. The furniture at the end was large, which I noticed was the best furniture in the place.</p> <p>‘You want to go for a swim,’ he said. ‘You can get out on the terrace in the nude if you want.’ I got up and walked over to the open window, watching him undress, and saw the big pool that it was on the terrace. As I went nearer, I could hear the water. He waved me around to get naked, and so too, I was. The water glowed and bathed my body in a white light, causing my nipples to stiffen and become even longer. I looked at him in the reflection of the clear glass window. It looked out as well and we were in the middle of the terrace, which seemed large enough for a single family to enter if they wanted.</p> <p>I saw that he was stroking his cock, which was also standing out in front of him. I had never seen a cock quite so long, even with hardly any foreskin being on its top. I wanted to see it, to feel it in my mouth. He smiled a little self-consciously, and went to change. I heard him go into the bathroom and I walked out there – again topless. I sat down on the sofa with my legs opened. I had done a good deal of self-pleasure in front of the window: it would be worth losing a little money for this afternoon.</p> <p>It was easy enough to come again, and after several minutes I was ready again. I took care of the first part of my plan. I wanted to see him come. I wanted to see his cock come, even when his hand stayed over his cock, and I wanted him to come with me this time. It would give me some time to get ready. I waited to see what he might do; it was a bit of an exercise when a man had never shown his cock to me. I had to find out if it would be as big as my husband, and I had always hoped he had not. It would be so much better if I could make sure it got as big as my husband, because I felt his foreskin was not a good fit. I wondered how big the head of his cock would be with his thumb and forefinger. I couldn’t get my cock to stiffen up, if it was going to be in the water. I decided to wait for a while. My hands were on my thighs as I enjoyed watching him again. A moment later I felt his hand on my thigh. His fingers moved up inside my panties and caressed my inner thigh, sending shivers up my spine even as I got more excited.
