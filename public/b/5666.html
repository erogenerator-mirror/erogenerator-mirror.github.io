You're just kind of cute." It was true, I still had a bit of an attraction to her. She was a girl and she was so pretty.</p> <p>"I'll take that as a complement." she said in a way that I knew was the truth and she couldn't help but smile at me. I couldn't believe what just happened. Her body almost felt like it would burn through my soul, just a short, fleeting touch, a touch a little of the intensity of passion that we shared.</p> <p>"Well, I'm glad you were there," I responded. "How was it?" She was still smiling when she got up and walked back to the bedroom.</p> <p>"It was incredible and I think I owe you one." she said as she closed the bedroom door.</p> <p>I laughed. I felt terrible. I wanted to do that again. "I would never do that to you," I said. "You deserve to take it the other way around." Then I turned and followed her back to our bedroom.</p> <p>"I'll show you where the bedroom is tonight," she said as we walked through.</p> <p>"I don't know about that yet, mom. It may be a while."</p> <p>"You haven't gotten me naked yet, but I'll show you," she said in a stern voice.</p> <p>When we got to the bedroom, I noticed that her bathrobe had come off in the bathroom.</p> <p>"Take your underwear off for me," she said. It was like we were speaking inside our heads, no not yet. I looked at her for a brief minute before I took off my pants. When I stood naked in the middle of the room, she sat down on the large double bed.</p> <p>"How about a little kissing?" she asked as she lay back on the large leather chair where she had been sitting when we first got in the room.</p> <p>I climbed on top of her and we embraced in a long kiss. I ran my hands up her body until I was under her robe. It was one of her robes that she had let slip off months ago when we got married. She was wearing it now. I ran my hands around and through her gorgeous body and slowly moved up to cup her ample breasts.</p> <p>After a few strokes, her voice said, "Take my bra off," as she pushed me back on the bed.</p> <p>I was in shock. I wasn't sure I should do this. I thought that the marriage was over. Why was I being unfaithful?</p> <p>"Don't be stupid," she said as she rolled her eyes. "He's my baby. He's your own baby. And I love him. He'll never hurt you. We share everything." But it did sound like she meant more than that. "Do you really mean that?" she asked as she turned on her side with her head toward me. Her face was almost touching my chest, and it made me uncomfortable to be touching her but also aroused at the same time. I leaned forward and kissed her lips.</p> <p>"Oh god." she said as she kissed my lips. "And I'm not giving you what you've already gotten me."</p> <p>"No, no no, I want it. I want you."</p> <p>Her fingers took mine and guided them down her body to hers. They made one last, slow, hesitant movement before I touched her lips once more.</p> <p>"Don't." she said as she closed her eyes and leaned into me.</p> <p>As if everything were happening in slow motion, I moved my lips to her neck. She was laying on her back with her legs open. I could see the top of her pussy as it got wetter and wetter. I moved my tongue back to her nipple and licked. She pushed out a soft moan.</p> <p>I started on her left breast but avoided her aureole. I concentrated on her left breast but continued to move down her body. I could barely go down as she pushed into me from below her waist. I was on my stomach when I stopped to get a kiss. There was no mistaking what she wanted from me. It was a kiss she needed, and a promise she would never give up.</p> <p>When I got to her pussy, I had to fight her for a long time so I just moved my tongue along it. I had never wanted anything more in her life than when she was mine. Her breath was in my mouth, and I felt her thighs moving to wrap around my head. It was pure bliss. "Oh god, honey." she said as she pulled me closer. We were going to share our first time.</p> <p>While continuing to keep my tongue on her nipple, I ran my hands slowly down her body down to the tops she was wearing.
