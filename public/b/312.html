She's our waitress."</p> <p>"Ah, what about you? Did you like that night?" I turned on the charm and put on a fake smile.</p> <p>"I couldn't say yes, but I think she enjoyed it," I lied.</p> <p>"Oh, but I know that."</p> <p>"Do you and her ever do anything to eat?" I asked.</p> <p>"Oh no, never. She just gets out of control," Alex explained. "They like to do it together."</p> <p>We got a room at the Bellwood Inn and I ordered a bottle of wine. We had a small table in the corner. I put my arm around my wife before I sat down.</p> <p>"So," I started, "I guess this brings up something that your husband just told our little family in New Zealand how to do."</p> <p>"How do you mean?" she asked.</p> <p>"Well," I went on, "there were a lot of places in the island where they're really good, like the islands."</p> <p>"You mean," she asked, "there are places where we go to for Christmas and a few other holidays."</p> <p>"Well, yes, there are," I stated.</p> <p>I could see how her mind raced. She was trying to think of an excuse to tell Dad, but she was just not sure she could bring up the subject. "What about you?" Alex asked.</p> <p>"Well, I mean," I answered slowly. "You know how I told you that I don't want to be your girlfriend."</p> <p>My wife nodded and then she started to cry again.</p> <p>"Please stop, it's just that-"</p> <p>"Please put it out of your mind."</p> <p>My wife put her head on my shoulder and her cheek pressed against my neck and I could feel her heart racing. I held her tightly to me and kissed her forehead while my hand held her hand.</p> <p>"I do love you, Honey," I said between kisses. "And if you ever need someone or just don't feel like it, I love you too. I'll do whatever you want, and if you love me in any way, why don't you bring your son with you and go get him and have a drink from the bar. You know, the ones from last year on."</p> <p>"I don't know, I guess that's just wrong with both of us."</p> <p>This was my second time in a row that I told a woman, and she was never going to tell me the exact story of how she got me into this situation, but her words calmed me down and I kissed her back and hugged her.</p> <p>After the dinner, we sat on the sofa and started talking about how things were going with our love life. I was trying to figure out how to put it. She looked up at me and said "So, I guess you and your husband decided to live with your sister? Are you sure you want to stay with us?"</p> <p>"Oh, sure, you'd never know. It's like a long-distance thing. You know, like, every week."</p> <p>"But how does a relationship work?"</p> <p>"It can be intense, and sometimes it can be really good. You know, where she's my girlfriend..."</p> <p>"I know, but you can let me know if you are too worried about it. I know there's plenty of time if you just can find the nerve to ask. It could be important to you, too," she added.</p> <p>"It could be, we might meet up with them and I may want to see how they're doing," I finally blurted out.</p> <p>"What do you mean I might want to see if they're doing as good or more than they're doing?"</p> <p>"Well, that could be important. I mean we'd have our own problems, but we might get out of a big one, and you know that it would be wonderful if it worked out."</p> <p>"Wow, I wouldn't have any control right now. Would be a crazy thing to do when you haven't been trying to get with someone else and to make a big decision that will devastate you."</p> <p>"Honey, it will be the best, and I don't want you to have to worry about that."</p> <p>We ended up watching an entire movie that evening and went to bed early the next morning. Before we got up, we kissed and cuddled close. We kissed for what seemed forever before we both fell asleep in each other's arms.</p> <p>I didn't have to spend the day thinking about what we would do over the next few days. I had a plan and I had come up with it.
