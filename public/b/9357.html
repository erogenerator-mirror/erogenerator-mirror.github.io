And I certainly hope not!"</p> <p>"I'm not that big, though."</p> <p>We smiled at each other and we both laughed.</p> <p>"Yeah, I know," I said. "So, tell me about this fucking wedding. Have you ever been to them?"</p> <p>She was looking at me with shock on her face when I said that. She turned beet red and looked at it for a second. "Um, I was just kidding. I know you're a friend of my mom's and I was just trying to go down on her, but I would have never thought that would be fun."</p> <p>I saw a long look on her face and realized how much she loved my mom. She was as surprised at her decision to leave my mom and me alone as my mother was that she wanted to go, but she agreed.</p> <p>"No, of course we have. How about you?" I said, trying not to sound disappointed. "Did you do the bachelor party for my mother?"</p> <p>She looked at me in surprise and shook her head no.</p> <p>"Yeah, I did," she said, still shaking her head.</p> <p>I tried not to sound so disappointed, but I could tell she wanted a part time job and was still considering it. It was obvious that she was still undecided, but at the moment, she was not interested in having one. "Well at least you are going to get your bachelor party, huh?" I asked, trying not to sound too excited.</p> <p>"I would love to," she said without hesitation. "Well, I guess we should leave now."</p> <p>We both turned our faces away from each other and she got up, gathered her dress and panties in her hand and left.</p> <p>The following week was great. I took the following weekend off, took her out shopping and bought all my things, including an old car. Her mother had a car, too, so I could buy it myself.</p> <p>Once we got home that night, she was still shocked over what she had heard in my room.</p> <p>"You did it?" she asked. "It was a one time thing?"</p> <p>"Yeah, that was just part of the wedding."</p> <p>"Oh, come on, it doesn't matter. Who did what anyway!"</p> <p>"I've heard it, too, but I just couldn't believe it either, at least not when it happened," I said with a laugh.</p> <p>I knew she was probably going to be pissed off that I was the one that had cheated on her, but at least I didn't have to worry about it.</p> <p>That week she seemed to be taking a great deal of herself off, and I tried to give her a little comfort by giving her a "I love you" type speech. She seemed to love it, but couldn't quite believe it either.</p> <p>One thing she said was that she was really sorry I hadn't stopped seeing her sooner. We had started that night in her room with a lot of kissing - it was great.</p> <p>There was one of those moments in a couple weeks when the timing and events never worked out. I still had things to do ahead of me, but my mom was out shopping that Saturday.</p> <p>"You know, I could do with a shower before I went out with you and some dinner in bed, too," I said. "I've got some work to do the following week."</p> <p>"I can't go out shopping with a strange man," she said. "And I can't get up to do anything sexy," she added. "You know what I mean. Besides, this was all new to me," she said.</p> <p>"Yeah, I know what you mean. That's good," I told her. "But I'll call you later and see what I can do."</p> <p>The whole night ended badly for her and she was furious when I arrived at work.</p> <p>"I know you don't understand," she told me, "But they can't change things between you and me!"</p> <p>"I know, but I'm still working with you there," I told her.</p> <p>That night, at the bachelor party, something happened that surprised me.</p> <p>"This night will be amazing," she said. "You can't tell him that you're not my mom. I'm the one who's going to be at the wedding." She added. "It will be my secret! I'm the one who will have to be the happiestâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
