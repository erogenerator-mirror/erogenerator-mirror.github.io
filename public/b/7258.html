"I'm happy to be in your presence, Master."</p> <p>"Good. You will always be remembered as my special slave. I shall be making some changes, but I want to take what little time I have to think about it. I want you to be happy."</p> <p>"Thanks, Master. That means a lot to me. I hope I can keep up with you."</p> <p>"I know you can. You'll always do as I say."</p> <p>Jenny was so happy to be with Master again. She couldn't bear to wait until morning to make her way outside again. After she woke up tomorrow, she would come home in just a bikini and then go shopping.</p> <p>Jenny walked up the steps and entered the house. "Hi daddy. I'm home. I'm looking for you. Do you have a minute?"</p> <p>Travis couldn't believe his good fortune. He stood and smiled at Jenny and told her how gorgeous she was. "How did you get home?"</p> <p>"It's a long story and it only seems a little fuzzy when it comes to the last part."</p> <p>They sat down in the living room and discussed how they would do the house when Jodi was there. When they were ready, Travis walked over to Jenny and gave her a hug, which she returned. Jodi felt so warm and comfortable with her Master.</p> <p>"Hello, Jenny. I hope you're ready and that you're home before midnight. You know we want you back tonight."</p> <p>"Yes, Master. I'll be ready."</p> <p>"Good. Your car's in the garage. Is your sister here yet?"</p> <p>"She's got a surprise for you, Master," answered Jenny.</p> <p>Jenny left Travis standing there on the other side of the coffee table. They talked about all manner of things. She told him about her sister and how she met her parents. She told him about how Master was a member of the church. Travis listened to her as her story unfolded in her mind.</p> <p>"Jenny, are you sure about something?" said Travis.</p> <p>"No, Master."</p> <p>"Jenny, when your sister gets here, I want you to come over to my house now and see what her surprise is. I don't want to talk about it, until the next opportunity arises. Now go."</p> <p>"Yes, Master. I love you. Thank you," laughed Jenny.</p> <p>"Now go," said Travis.</p> <p>Jenny turned and walked up to her bedroom to get cleaned up a bit. When she entered her room once things were cleaned off, she stood in front of her mirror and looked at her reflection. Her hair was done up in back and her clothing was laid out in front of her. Her makeup had been applied carefully but just a couple of minutes earlier. She felt very comfortable wearing what she considered was the most revealing outfit she'd have to parade around in front of Master after midnight. She felt very sexy in her tight jeans and halter top. She was sure that Travis would love it.</p> <p>Jenny came out of the bathroom wearing her new clothes. He watched as she walked toward him. Her hips swayed as she went and she looked so sexy. Just his presence and staring at her didn't help her ease the tension in her back and her heart rate increased.</p> <p>Jenny finally stopped and turned around smiling at her reflection. "Is everything okay?" she asked.</p> <p>"Everything's fine." He reached up and tweaked her nipple. "You look so sexy in black, like the real thing."</p> <p>Jenny couldn't believe she was standing in front of a man twice her age now. "You're just being so sweet," she lied. She felt a little silly because her husband and his man had only known the two of them once.</p> <p>"You're very sexy, Jenny. I've always admired you."</p> <p>Jenny's knees were trembling. Travis was right about everything she believed about him. She'd never been more attracted to another man or a man's body than she was to him. Travis was the only one who ever looked at her the way she was about him. "I like it a lot."</p> <p>"It's only fair then, that you do what I told you and your fantasy should come true with the consequences of it. Do you always want to do this?"</p> <p>Jenny thought for a few moments before answering. "I do, Master."</p> <p>"Good, then I suppose you'll have to get started." He helped her up and escorted her into Travis' bathroom. She walked into the bathtub.</p> <p>"Jodi, I want you to go into the bathtub with me. You know how I like it when a man's in the tub with meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
