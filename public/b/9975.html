But, if you change your mind, let me know. I'll take care of it and make it perfect again."</p> <p>I stood up. I was standing there in front of her; I was a long way from a complete naked girl, only in my underwear. Her eyes opened to admit it. I looked deep at her as I reached out and took her hand, feeling the softness of her skin. I felt my hands tighten as I slowly led her to the edge of the bed where she laid down on her back and waited.</p> <p>"What would you like me to do now?" I asked. Her eyebrows raised as she looked at me. She had a questioning look on her face.</p> <p>"I can do it."</p> <p>Her answer was that she'd like to look at my cock, so I reached for it and positioned it so it pointed up between her legs. She lay there with her eyes staring at the ceiling as I slowly rubbed the head of my cock against her slit, feeling the soft warmth of her pussy.</p> <p>"Do me." She whispered. "Fuck me." It was a demand, an invitation that she wouldn't refuse.</p> <p>I moved forward and positioned my cock at the entrance to her slit. I wanted to feel that hot, wet heat surrounding my cock, but no use was forced. She would have no control over what she felt, other than my touch. I felt her wetness close around me as I slowly thrust forward and was surprised. I felt her tighten as my cock pushed inside her pussy over and over. I looked down and saw that my pubic hair had grown thicker than I remembered. Her eyes widened at the shock, and her face scrunched up in excitement. I felt the resistance of her pussy before I was fully inside her.</p> <p>"How big are you?" She asked me, as she watched my cock pull almost all the way out and then back in again. She gasped as every inch of me penetrated her, and she clutched at it once more as I slowly slid my penis back out. I started moving my hips again as she moaned and her breath was stilled by the shock of it. I could feel her body, but her legs seemed to have other parts as I started thrusting in and out of her again. Her breathing came in short, sharp rasps as I continued to push her pussy over in time with my own movements.</p> <p>"I want you to push it in." She said softly as she watched me move the head of my cock around inside her. "Please." Her voice wasn't a shout, but one that told me she wanted it. I continued moving my hips, pressing it slowly inside her as she moaned. I felt my cock begin to throb again as the first surge of cum started firing inside me in the heat of the moment. I let go with my hips, and my cock continued to throb inside her pussy as I felt the first blast of cum splash its way down my shaft. The feeling was electric.</p> <p>I closed my eyes and savored the moment as there was no turning back as my cock continued to pump my cum into her. It seemed to last a long while as I lay there in pleasure. I felt the second blast at the back of my cock, and then the third. The third was even stronger, and it must have been the second time she was going to cum, I could tell. The third shot splattered my stomach as my climax passed into her. I collapsed forward, and lay beside her on the bed with my head on her lap.</p> <p>"You'll probably think I'm crazy when it comes to that." she said sleepily.</p> <p>I smiled as I stroked her hair over the back of her neck.
