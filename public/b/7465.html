I opened my lips to taste her, to taste my first kiss. Our mouths met, and I felt my heart skip a beat as that first tentative contact, that first little thrill of discovery. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest, and I knew she could too. Our kisses were long and hard, and she kissed me as if she was the sweetest thing on earth. She slid her hands down my chest, and I felt her fingernails brush my skin beneath the satin of my robe.</p> <p>I moaned into her mouth as she slipped the robe off, and pushed my hands from her shoulders to her small breasts. I could feel as much of her as I could see, and when she released me from our kiss, I moaned again, more loudly, as her fingers found my nipples, teased them gently before taking both of my wrists in her hands once more. I could feel her lips leave mine to trail down my chin, to my neck. She took in the scent, the musky, manly essence of my woman, and her breathing quickened, her lips found my collarbones, my throat, and her hand pulled my collar down from shoulder to neck.</p> <p>I felt her teeth scrape against the soft flesh of my collarbone as her tongue found my neck. I felt the first little shudder, followed by the first tremor of her mouth being so near my skin. Her hands came up to the back of my neck, and pressed hard against the small of my back, her nails biting down in a sharp angle that surprised me as she worked her way down, over, and into the hollow of my neck. Her hands left me as she began to draw her fingers up the front of my sweater, and she found the zipper on the back. She tugged it, and my sweater slid off my shoulders as she slid hers down my arms. I felt her skin as her cool fingers ran across my breasts, circling my nipples, and she felt them grow harder as she circled them.</p> <p>I felt her hand on my left breast, the soft skin of her palm on the underside. I felt her tongue run across my nipple, which hardened against her palm as she drew lightly and then quickly across the tip of my nipple. Her tongue flicked and teased and I cried out into her hand, feeling her teeth caress and tease the sensitive skin there. I felt her fingers slide between my thighs as she traced my clitty with her fingertip before pulling it between her lips, and licking it quickly again before sliding the finger back down to follow the trail of her tongue and my throbbing clitty.</p> <p>Her hands moved from my breasts to my sides, and she pulled me firmly against her as she kissed me deeply, her lips pressing against mine and her tongue searching for mine between moans of pleasure. Her breath flowed over mine like hot water, and I felt her teeth tugging gently at my lower lip, and then her tongue snaked back into my mouth, and I kissed her with as much force as she had been doing to me. Her breath flowed over mine as she kissed me, and I tasted herself. I could not hold back any longer, and we broke the kiss long enough to gasp out her name and kiss again.</p> <p>She continued kissing me until we were both breathing hard, and then she pressed two fingers against my wetness, opening me to them, and sliding them as deep as they would go inside me when she was ready to move onto other parts of my body. I felt her lips kissing me hard, and then her fingers began to rub and move against my clit while her tongue continued to trace and lick my breasts, teasing my nipples.</p> <p>Her hips began to move in concert with her fingers, and I could tell that she was getting near to climax, and I felt my juices flowing down my thighs and pooling on the floorboard of the pool deck as she started to gasp, and move faster against me. I felt her finger slide into my pussy and her thumb against my clit as those two fingers moved inside and out of me, the other hand was caressing and teasing me. I could not keep my legs from moving, and I could not feel them any longer as my body exploded in a shuddering orgasm, shaking against her hand, then collapsing against her, panting and trying to catch my breath.</p> <p>We both fell against the wall, and she hugged me, pressing her breasts firmly against my back as her fingertips touched my breasts, sending pulses of pleasure and tingles up and down my arms.</p> <p>"Wow," I sighed, "That was some cum."</p> <p>She laughed and kissed my neck, then stepped back for one last kiss as her hand slid up my leg from between her thighs where her fingers had been.
