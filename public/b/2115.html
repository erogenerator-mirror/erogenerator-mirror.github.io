I replied, "It's a woman who knows how to please her man. When you are here, you feel a certain level of freedom, but when we are together, you feel a degree of embarrassment and frustration that you feel when you are alone. It gives you a sort of sense that your partner seems to share with each other and in the same way that is normal for us. We also like that feeling. And it has always been a way for us to see that someone should experience something similar for herself to see the difference."</p> <p>"I have to say, I agree." she answered, "It must be a wonderful experience,"</p> <p>"Thank you. And I am glad you're getting on with that. Perhaps it is a bit embarrassing for you to have to talk this way."</p> <p>"It doesn't bother me," she said, "I have been having a rather nice day."</p> <p>The three of us went into the kitchen to have a cup of coffee, talking about the day's events while we added a bit of the other stuff that she had been expecting.</p> <p>"I think you know a little more about me", she said as she added some of his secret ingredient to some of the more special items that he had made for her.</p> <p>"The thing that I discovered was the way you were talking and looking at me . . . the way you carried yourself."</p> <p>"What did it really look like?"</p> <p>"This would be one of the two things that most girls in our community would have been proud of," he said, "but the other thing that is most unusual is when you came to him for any kind of assistance. When you got to me, what happened?"</p> <p>"Well, first," she said, pointing to him, smiling, and then looking down. "You did what you wanted to, so please don't ever be surprised. I didn't mean to embarrass you."</p> <p>"What difference does it make to you because I saw you with someone at the party?" he asked.</p> <p>"No one was there." she added, "You'll see."</p> <p>"But what about us?" he said, "What was it that you wanted to share with me?"</p> <p>"I wanted to tell you that I felt good when you were giving me my first orgasm with my husband's dick."</p> <p>She gave me a look, but I just ignored it and then looked back at him. "Yes, you can tell me anything about that." she said, "My first time was better than it was for you."</p> <p>"It certainly is," he said as he looked back down at his plate, "that was awesome!"</p> <p>I was so shocked by that admission that I didn't know whether to be upset or flattered. I decided it wasn't going to happen and I decided to leave it alone until we finished our breakfast. "I don't know about you," she said as she came behind him, "but thank you for telling me." She put one hand on his chest and gave him a hug. "I wanted to let you know that I was not upset with what you did with your husband's mouth and the whole thing was a new experience for me," she said, "You are really a wonderful man, I hope he felt the same way."</p> <p>She sat down on the bench next to me and we talked the whole time. She was not in a rush to tell me, but she had told me a few minutes before and I had listened to her story. "What kind of man was he?" I asked.</p> <p>"He wasn't a man at all. He was a man who appreciated a woman's physical attributes." she said. "That's what he really was. He was a great little fuck to a beautiful young lady like me."</p> <p>"It did seem so long ago that he and I were married," I said, "That we might actually be the most open with each other than we are now."</p> <p>"I'm trying to tell you that," she said, "I am very open to the idea. I'm not exactly sure what happened," she said, "But I am willing to find out before we get too far out of hand. I have to admit that once again, you make me feel so much better."</p> <p>"It's good to hear that," I agreed, "It makes me feel comfortable with you."</p> <p>"It makes me feel good to be able to say that." she said.</p> <p>We were finishing up our breakfast when I asked her, "How about you?"</p> <p>"I can't help but say the same thing to you, "she said.</p> <p>"We can talk about our sex lives to come," I said, "but I guess we shouldâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
