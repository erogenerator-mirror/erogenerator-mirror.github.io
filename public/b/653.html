I asked.</p> <p>She laughed, and said. "The only way to reach me is to get into my room."</p> <p>I was not as horny as I was before and thought about masturbating but decided not to until after my dinner.</p> <p>We had dinner in my hotel room before we went to the mall. Since it was Saturday, we decided to shop for clothes first. The first day was a shopping spree as we got some new clothes to wear. After we got the first day back at home, she asked. "Where were we?"</p> <p>"Well, you were my first date and I didn't do anything but take a walk through the mall; I had fun."</p> <p>"What did you do that for?" she asked with a smile.</p> <p>"Well, we were at the theater and then had a few drinks in the back seat of my car."</p> <p>"Why did you go so far?" she asked sounding interested.</p> <p>"Well, it was a fun night. I had a great time. I liked the way you made me feel. I was glad that I had to drive to the other end of town."</p> <p>"Well, that was nice," she giggled. "That means I was a good date, too."</p> <p>"That makes sense."</p> <p>I told her that had been quite a night and was thinking about spending the next afternoon taking care of my business.</p> <p>"Great, thanks!" she agreed. "That would be nice."</p> <p>"No problem," I said looking at her from head to toe and back to hers. "I'll look forward to doing more with you."</p> <p>It did not take her long to get excited at me and to think about what she had just done. She was a very good looking woman and had always flirted with me with the first day we came to our first date. As the day had progressed, she began to flirt back with me and even gave me a hand job before we left the hotel. As I learned more and more about her I began to learn more about her and to see her in action. Her eyes sparkled back at me as I told her how pretty she looked in her black miniskirt, black top, black leggings, black bra and high heels. Of course, she said no panties and that was the last one I saw as she put her fingers into the side of my skirt. When I told her how sexy she looked, she told me that I wasn't wearing any panties.</p> <p>She ran her hand up my thigh and under the hem of my skirt. "Mmmmm", she moaned. Her fingers were in contact with my pussy and she moved them around to the front and slid them just inside my pussy. "You're so wet" she said as she ran her fingertips up and down my wet pussy lips. I began to feel that familiar tingle that I know so well.</p> <p>"Oooooh, that feels good", I moaned.</p> <p>She quickly slid her fingers under the panel of my skirt and began to stroke the lips of my pussy.</p> <p>"Oh God, yes, baby", I moaned.</p> <p>That was all the encouragement she needed as she quickly removed her finger from my pussy and began to run her finger all around my pussy. She used her finger to rub my swollen clit and slid her finger into my pussy while running her finger in and out of me.</p> <p>"I need you in me now, I need to cum", I begged.</p> <p>"Oh, yes, let's go to the bedroom now," she said and we got up and went into the bedroom where we quickly undressed as I lay on the bed. She quickly undressed and stood before me fully nude and then quickly put her heels back on. Then, she leaned forward and kissed me deeply as her hands reached between us and began to caress my breasts. She slid my skirt and top off and stood smiling as she ran her hands down my body until they reached my waist where they slid under the hem of my skirt and slid back up again. She had removed her jacket when she stood up. When she finished removing her skirt, she reached down to her handbag and retrieved the little bottle of lube that she had found.</p> <p>"There, now it might make it easier." she said as she opened the cap and squirted a generous amount of it on my chest. Then, she slid back onto the bed on top of me as we lay kissing each other. She rolled over and lifted my legs until my feet were off the bed and she could lower herself completely onto me. She began to move her hips rocking back and forth as she moved the lube around my pussy getting it good, then pushing it back on meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
