When they got home, I washed the dishes and put them away and made us a dinner to share, while she watched a movie. I knew that she was more into me than the movie, but I was willing and hungry. We spent most of the dinner together talking like old friends, as I was hungry and didn’t want to waste any more of my dinner.</p> <p>After dinner and a few drinks, the three of us went into her bedroom, and she lay face to face. It was as if there was a light in there from outside, and I could feel my cock start to rise. I could smell the perfume of her perfume and my dick had not subsided since she got out of the shower.</p> <p>“I’m glad that you had a good time.” She said and kissed me hard.</p> <p>“Me too!” I answered back to her, and got on top of her.</p> <p>I felt her open her legs and I went with her, and soon I had my hard cock pushed into her pussy. It was so tight and hot and velvety, but it felt so good! I went faster, more urgent, and she started to moan and moan louder and louder. She wrapped her legs around me with one of her hands and reached out to my hips with the other. She grabbed my ass with both hands as I pounded her hard and fast. We were fucking each other so hard, that we must have really cum at least two or three times on that bed!</p> <p>We laid like that, exhausted and satisfied for some time. We were lying there in each other’s arms with me still inside her as she spoke.</p> <p>“So I’m going to get out of this bed and get a shower. If the bed is a good thing, there is always next time.”</p> <p>“Oh shit, I thought we had sex with you on the bed?” I asked,</p> <p>“Oh, it was great, but it’s not like I have had that many orgasms tonight.”</p> <p>“I know there was a big one, but the sex in here was great!”</p> <p>“You mean that we were in a bed and a shower, that you made two or three different kinds of orgasms, while we sat in front of you. And that it was only sex?”</p> <p>“Well, not the usual sex stuff... just some light flirting and kissing.”</p> <p>“Well I never saw you with another woman before. That is a strange story!”</p> <p>“You never told me that I was bi. Is that true?”</p> <p>“No!”</p> <p>“No, you are bi?”</p> <p>“A little. I didn’t really want to, but you know that I like girls.”</p> <p>“Oh no, I wanted to get a chance. There are some things about having my friends watch you.”</p> <p>“I’m not gay, and not interested in guys.”</p> <p>“I would never want to.” I told her and she kissed me on the cheek.</p> <p>When she left the room, we lay side by side on the bed, just making out one more time, until she was out of sight. I went to the bathroom and got dressed and got into my car. I sat for awhile thinking about what had just happened and what I would do and do again. There was nothing that I wanted to do again. I still didn’t think that it was the sex or what we did, but whatever it was, it was great! I went back to my car and picked up the phone to call Melissa on her cell. She was home. “Hi Melissa, how are things?” I said, as I got into my car.</p> <p>“I’m very good. You have a great time.” And she was.</p> <p>The whole ride to her house I felt completely in love with her. There was something about her that I just couldn’t explain, but I couldn’t think about it. I really feel stupid about what just happened, but that was the whole point of being with her.</p> <p>Her house came into view next to mine. I pulled in the driveway, put the car out, and walked into the house. When I got inside, Melissa was sitting there in the living room. She was dressed in slacks and a halter top. She put a glass to a drink out of a cooler and sat down on the couch. I walked by, sat across from her, and took a drink of my—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
