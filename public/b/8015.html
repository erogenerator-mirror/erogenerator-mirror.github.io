He's just a dirty bastard. He's the one that always comes in my fucking panties, and when I'm away for so long, he's all yours."</p> <p>I felt my knees weaken and tried to grab his hand, but I don't think that it would have ended well for me if my hand had touched his. I felt him pull me against him and our lips met. I didn't move for a moment, it was as if I was in shock, but then I felt his hands roaming down of my back and cup my ass cheeks. I felt him run a finger down my crack, then between my cheeks and slide it into me.</p> <p>"How could a man like him be interested in being with a woman like me?"</p> <p>"He's a pervert."</p> <p>For some reason, it just occurred to me that he felt sorry for me. I mean it's not every guy that thinks of himself as gay, but he didn't have his own reasons, it was just because of what he had. I just went on autopilot, I never did find out his real name, although maybe I should just say it. It was only the first day, and it's what I always felt like. I'm not some commoner, and when I am not on the rag, I become a free woman.</p> <p>"I'm sorry that we didn't last, you were such a slut the first time."</p> <p>"Why did you tell him, he's just a pervert, that's all."</p> <p>"I can't remember him saying anything to me. It was kind of silly. Maybe I shouldn't be showing him, maybe that's enough. Do you have any idea who he is?"</p> <p>"I'm not sure either."</p> <p>"Maybe he's gay though, and not as nice as you."</p> <p>"I don't know, maybe maybe."</p> <p>"Maybe because I'm just that old woman."</p> <p>"You don't have to be a grandmother to be that old," I suggested.</p> <p>"That's just it. You never met. We're in a different time."</p> <p>"So, why are you still seeing him?"</p> <p>He hesitated, so I pulled him towards me and kissed him.</p> <p>"I'm still seeing some old bastard."</p> <p>It was an honest statement, but to the extent that it seemed honest to him, it kind of embarrassed him. He was a grown man, but not so young that he didn't have a good memory of people, so maybe that gave him a clue as to his status in this world.</p> <p>"I guess that I'm still seeing him," I answered.</p> <p>"Did I tell you that he's a perv?"</p> <p>"Yes, I think I saw his phone on your desk and the look on your face that first day. Do you want to do it again?"</p> <p>"It takes effort to be a normal middle aged woman, who I'm thirty-five, not my first and last lover after we broke up. Why don't we do it again, and I'll let you know when I want him to bring you up to speed."</p> <p>"What will he do, just call again and ask?"</p> <p>"Maybe I can come by and see you," I said with a wink.</p> <p>I really didn't mind, I had been thinking what to do for more variety of things, which he seemed to understand. It was something that I found exciting, as this might be my first try at anything. It seemed kind of weird for me to do that, I mean it would be a surprise, and I had never acted anything out of anything. And, really, it was strange for me to know that this old man might actually be interested in me, and that I would actually hook him up with a friend. He just seemed so kind and carefree.</p> <p>The idea of being at his beck and call, in front of him was really appealing to me, as well. I mean I was pretty sure that this man was gay, but if his old woman was interested, what difference did it really make? It was just something to think about. Maybe I could even take my husband's friend's name in case he did come over. Maybe he could get me to go a second time.</p> <p>I got up and went into my purse and got out my keys, and the driver's side door. I opened it and let him inside.</p> <p>"Come on, it's a little cold outside there. I'm freezing."</p> <p>He took my hand with his other arm, and he lead me towards the bedroom.
