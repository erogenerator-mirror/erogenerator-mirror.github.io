I reached up and undid her pants and pulled them down. She shuddered as I kissed her inner thigh. I kissed up between her legs to the hair. I kissed around her pussy lips, tasting her sweet juices. I flicked my tongue across her clit. Then I pressed my mouth back on to her and licked her clit. She began humping my tongue now. I pulled back and slid two fingers in her. I stroked them in and out. I found her G-spot and worked my fingers on her.</p> <p>"I'm going to orgasm soon, sweetie. Just watch me."</p> <p>I slid a finger over the top of her vagina and rubbed it over her clit. She jumped. I held her hips with one hand and licked her clit with the tip of my tongue. She came almost immediately, her juice coating my lips and her fingers. I pulled back and sat on the couch, pushing my pants back up. I pulled them off of me and helped her with them. I pulled her down onto my cock, stroking it in and out.</p> <p>"Oh, god. Keep doing that. It feels so good. Yeah. Yes. Oh, yess. Oh, yes. Eat me and play with me. Fuck me. Fuck me hard."</p> <p>I pumped in and out, enjoying the feeling. It didn't take long to get her going. Again, she grabbed me with her hands and moved me all over. I pumped faster.</p> <p>She lifted her ass and pushed back against the air. "Faster!"</p> <p>I worked my cock harder.</p> <p>"Yeah. Oh, baby, that's it. Yes! Yes! Faster! Faster!"</p> <p>I felt her clit, rubbing down on my shaft. She came again.</p> <p>"Oh, god. Yes, yes, yes. It's cumming! It's coming!"</p> <p>"Yes! It's coming! Keep going! I'm about to cum," I said.</p> <p>I pulled her hips tight into mine and I buried my cock inside of her and I let loose.</p> <p>"Oh, sweetie!"</p> <p>She kept on moaning, even though she knew that I was done.</p> <p>"Oh, yeah! I'm going to cum!"</p> <p>I pulled my cock out and she went off like a fire hose, her juices running through me as I came.</p> <p>I felt her collapse into a heap, and her head on my chest.</p> <p>"It was... wonderful."</p> <p>"But we have to do this again, right?"</p> <p>"How can you tell?"</p> <p>"We'll work that out."</p> <p>"Oh, and another first," She said as she ran her hand up my cock. "I'm not going to believe what I just did! I know I said earlier that I wouldn't do it, but, I had gone along with it. And, you know, I'm not ready to do that. I've gone way too far."</p> <p>I laughed out loud, and my dick twitched againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
