I can feel the blood racing in your veins. You are on fire."</p> <p>She could feel her own fire burning against the leather seat. This excited her even more. She was excited by the intensity of it all. She needed the release.</p> <p>The leather felt great against her, sliding her wetness down along his dick. His hands wrapped around her, holding her while continuing to fuck her hot wet pussy.</p> <p>He pulled his head away from her nipple.</p> <p>"Hmmmm, that feels good. Let's go a bit higher."</p> <p>She pushed him into a position where he could have fucked her harder. She could feel his balls brushing against her with every inch. She could feel his hard muscle massaging and pressing against her.</p> <p>She opened her eyes briefly to see the camera angle for the camera at his waist. She smiled inwardly and leaned back to rest against his chest.</p> <p>He slowly reached down and slid her thong down her legs. He slid it down to the floor. He leaned over and kissed her tenderly. His hand returned to her breast and he caressed it slightly. He looked deeply into her eyes as he kissed her. Their breathing was growing shallow...their souls dancing.</p> <p>He laid her lightly back on the sofa. "It's now or never."</p> <p>He knelt at her side. He had one foot up on his right leg and the other on his right thigh. He could feel her hot breath against his ear. She spoke softly to him, knowing that he loved it.</p> <p>"Now." she whispered. She felt his cock hardening again. It was so big that the head was now touching that spot on her thigh.."I need it....please...yes...fuck me." she moaned in anticipation.</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>He nodded and kissed her deeply. She felt herself rising. She loved the feel of another man's body against hers. She had never felt anything like the sensations her man could give her. This man who had just given her his love to give in return. Now she knew that she wanted this to happen.</p> <p>She felt him stand up, lowering himself to her, his arms still around her. She opened her eyes and his hands slipped off her shoulders to her arms, his strong hands caressing her breasts and her breasts. Her nipples were rock hard. They were a full inch from her areolas. She loved how they seemed to be poking into him.</p> <p>He began to kiss her neck gently; her chest was heaving into his hands. Her breath was coming in short gasps. Her heart was pounding in her chest. They continued to kiss deeply. Tongues, lips. They kissed each other fervently.</p> <p>His hands left her breast and traveled down her body. They slid under her thong, feeling the slick wetness between her thighs. He slipped it down her legs to the floor.</p> <p>"Let's get this off of you." he whispered to her. He gently lifted her leg and rolled it back. This exposed her. He felt her thigh, the small triangle of pubic hair that led to her hot, moist center, the lips so tenderly exposed, begging to be kissed. He could smell the sex in the air. So sweet...so inviting, she was inviting him to bring her to another orgasm.</p> <p>He sat back on his haunches, taking in her beauty. He looked down at the sight of her with his rock-hard cock. He raised himself up to her and laid the head against her lips. "Kiss me." he said in a commanding voice.</p> <p>She smiled at him as she leaned in to kiss his face. "If you were a woman...would you make love to me." she asked seductively. She wanted to feel the soft touch of another woman, the softness of those lips. She wanted to be one with him. She wanted to experience him, feel him touching her.</p> <p>She smiled a wicked smile to him. "Why don't you show me your passion first? You want to show me how much you want to make love to me." she teasingly cooed.</p> <p>He couldn't believe it. He moved over her and moved his cock directly into her. She moaned and wrapped her arms around him. Their lips met again as they each caressed the other. He could feel her hips moving...her legs parting to allow him to enter her. He could tell she was very excited.</p> <p>His hands slid over her ass and lifted her up. He began to move in and out slowly. Her hot tight pussy had his entire length in her in one slow motion. Each stroke sent a wave of pleasure through her. His body was tensed. Sweat was pouring from his forehead.
