He said as he took out the paper I had set up for him.</p> <p>"There was this...." he walked over to me and gently touched my cheek. "There's this big hole in the floor. I'm not going to let you up again until I've seen it and done what I want with it."</p> <p>"I don't want to go up to that hole." I said as he touched my chin again.</p> <p>"I know. But you have the key." And at that time he reached up and slowly slid the key out from under my clothes. I had gone out of my life to be just what I wanted to be. My only ambition in life was to become something great for me. I just loved my job and loved my life. Now I was finally going to have it all. I was now his.</p> <p>I looked up at him and realized I had been looking out the hole for the last couple of years. I had been doing this and there was no going back for me. It's not like there was a gun in there somewhere. We didn't need anyone to do that. There was one thing we had and if we could get a gun back from the local gun club one could be safe.</p> <p>Then I had to decide now. The only thing I didn't want to do was lose this job. So I had gotten to work on this hole and decided to make it special. This big hole could hold at least a dozen people. This hole needed to not just hold someone's life, but keep it alive.</p> <p>"I'll take this. It's a one-way street. That's what we'll have in here tomorrow." said the young man in the chair. "So I guess we'll have to come up with some alternative plans."</p> <p>"I wouldn't take it. I won't let a single drop of grease spill out. There's no chance of that."</p> <p>Now he reached down and pushed me back onto my back and got me up into the hole. I knew what he wanted and I didn't want to tell him.</p> <p>"I'll have to go right up to that hole. I don't want you to see me in here." He said as he walked over to the next hole.</p> <p>"That hole isn't mine." I told him as he got me back down on my hands and knees.</p> <p>I felt him slide his hand up my side as he pushed the paper up under my skirt. I had felt his fingers when they came up between my legs. That was what I needed that night. This piece of shit was there and he could fuck it into me. That was what I needed and that was what I deserved.</p> <p>"I never said these things unless I was saying them." I said as I felt his hand on my backside.</p> <p>Suddenly the hole behind me opened up and the young guy stepped in and pushed his finger up me while I squirmed around. I felt like I was trapped there. A person of all different ages and races and ages I didn't know had sex with me and yet in a place that was not mine I was in the dark.</p> <p>"So you don't want me in that hole." I told him. "You don't want it to hurt too much."</p> <p>"Why are you in the dark? What if we get caught up in the darkness."</p> <p>"Oh, we don't have to worry about that. I'm on the street. It's my job to get him out of there. I don't care to be seen out here." I told him as I felt him grab my hips and hold me down. I felt his hard cock pressing against me as a new finger slid through me. It felt different. It didn't hurt because it wasn't my finger. It felt even better. I don't know if I could have let this go on forever and yet here I was on the same piece of paper that I'd been holding for five years. I wasn't sure how to feel.</p> <p>"I hope you're ready to be in this town." said the young man as he ran his hand up and down my rear side. As he ran his hand up and down I felt something and then another. I had to have both. I had to either give in or let them stop.</p> <p>I gave a little moan and pulled against his wrists holding onto his hips. He was moving his hands slowly up and down my sides as I began to really get into it. Then as he began to slide his hands up and down my sides my legs began to move up and down. He stopped his hands long enough to say "you've given in. It's time to put some of this pressure on your body. You can work your way up if you like."</p> <p>Withâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
