As I penetrated her, she moaned her ecstasy. I felt her inner muscles constrict around me as she tried to hold me in, as I felt her wetness, as I caressed her inner walls. I leaned forward, kissing the hollow of her neck. Tawny moaned a wordless sound as her eyes rolled back and she reached around to cup my face in her hands. I felt a tingle of pleasure as her soft finger slid up my nose, her breath tickling my lips as she whispered, "Suck my nipple, baby...you taste so good."</p> <p>I moaned into her skin as her finger slid out again as her other hand pushed down my chest to begin teasing my nipple with its very tip. I ran my hands up her body cupping her beautiful bared breasts as she pulled my face down to hers. I could feel the moistness of her kiss coming from within the kiss, the warm softness of her soft mouth as she drew it in to give me hers. As Tawny closed her lips I sensed her tongue slide past my lips as her hot breath began to waft around my body and across my lips. Tawny was panting, her eyes glistening with a mixture of desire and satisfaction. Her hands pulled me tightly to her. She was trying to pull her lips from mine, but I had to force her to my body. The taste of her, the smell of her body, the feel of her against me, the feel of her legs wrapped around my body. All the things that had previously, if we had had an evening together, that I felt from her, would have been enough. We never did have much of a relationship...but I loved every inch of her.</p> <p>We broke the kiss and Tawny's head lay back against my shoulder. I leaned over her, my mouth capturing her earlobe as her hand slid across my back to the swell of my erection. I felt her hand wrap itself around me as my cock slowly entered her. I moaned as I felt her hand slide up and down my length. Tawny moaned as my cock filled her inner walls, stretching her even further than I was already. Once inside, I began a slow, but deliberate stroke in and out of her.</p> <p>"God, Tawny," I groaned, running my hands from her ankles to her waist before I lowered myself into her again.</p> <p>"Fuck me baby," she moaned softly.</p> <p>"Tawny, are you sure you're ready for this?" I breathed into her ear.</p> <p>Tawny's head was still facing me. I was watching her face as she held her eyes closed. She shook her head slightly as my lips met hers...her tongue slipping into my mouth as my cock slid deeper inside of her. I held my lips in place until she pulled away again, then slowly drew back as she gazed into her eyes, a look of longing on her face.</p> <p>"Yes, baby," she whispered. "I will fuck you now."</p> <p>This was the moment that I was waiting for. We were both anticipating the moment of truth. I was waiting for her to tell me she loved me...to tell me that she wanted to be held in my arms as I had in her house in those many months. But I wasn't going to give her that. The look on my face told her what I wanted. I moved back and gently pushed my cock back into Tawny and held her hip to move her in the way I wanted her in. Tawny was pushing back onto me as she lay flat on her back with me lying beneath her. Her head leaned back against my chest, her eyes closed as we held each other in our arms.</p> <p>I could have left the moment, of course. But I knew that it would be the right time for me to bring our sexual desires to the fore with that first penetration. My cock was as hard as it had ever been. My balls were tightening as I knew that I was close to coming. Tawny's body was writhing in my arms. Her face looked so sexy as her body moved in my arms as I began moving in and out of her again and again. I could feel the heat of her against me as my cock slipped deeper into her...her body was as hot as a spring as my cock slid in and out of her. Tawny was pulling my face harder into her chest as our bodies ground together...her head thrown back the sounds of our moans filled the room as our bodies became one. I could feel my own excitement rising as the sensations of our two bodies moving together became even more intense.</p> <p>I felt Tawny shaking as the first of her orgasms began.
