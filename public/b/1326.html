He had been attracted to her for quite some time, and he had learned a long time ago that she was interested in everything from sports, to literature, and he decided his attraction to her was more like sexual attraction. In an email from her, all the questions seemed innocent-like, but they were all in a hurry to be answered for themselves. She had asked him all kinds of questions, too, and he'd responded to each one with a bit of a "I don't know what to say." Finally, he gave up and said, in his best voice, "Sure, what do you think? I've had sex with nearly 10 girls already, and, for a guy my age, my penis is already rock-hard." She laughed, and they decided, in a heartbeat, that they might as well get a job done and go back to work.</p> <p>He thought her the one to blame for his attitude to sex with girls in general, who, for whatever reason, had no respect for the idea. What bothered him was that in the words of this girl, she had used him in a very vulgar and disgusting way, and he did not even mind this. She didn't mind, of course, but he wondered when she was going to tell him, and he was in his tracks when she finally did. She told him not to worry about it and that she would think about that one day.</p> <p>That afternoon, they were finishing their second bottle of wine, then she looked at him and said, "I need to talk to you some more."</p> <p>He hesitated a moment, not knowing what she was talking about and then, he said, very softly and sweetly, "Of course. What's up?"</p> <p>She got off the bed, put down the dutiful glass, took his hand, and, without another word, led him to her bathroom. She sat on the toilet and gently took his penis out. "This isn't the worst thing I could have done, is it?" she said. She closed the water. "Well, if I keep doing it, I'll probably want to stop." Then she leaned forward and kissed the end of his cock. It sprang into life almost immediately, and she felt the first wave of pleasure and warmth as she kissed it. Then she looked up to him and, looking him in the eye, she licked the end of his cock and said, "Now, we're going to need to get you out of your clothes."</p> <p>"What?" he asked as he began undressing.</p> <p>"Come and lie down on the bed," she said, pushing him back onto the pillows of the bed. She sat back and opened her mouth to show him the treat she had in mind, then she knelt between his legs and took his penis into her mouth. He tried to push his body up into her face and then down into hers, but, in the end, he had no trouble accommodating her. She took his whole thing in and started working on it with her lips, her teeth, and her tongue. Finally, she just lay there and let him feel the feelings as his hands went to her head and stroked her hair. Suddenly, he was ready, and he said, as forcefully and loudly as he could, "Shoot it in my mouth. I want to taste you. Here it comes, I can't hold on any longer!" She looked up his body at the surprised expression on his face, and then she just pulled away from his penis and started getting his clothes off. He looked on as she slipped out of her skirt and her panties to reveal her bush, her nakedness, and then she went to him and straddled his face. He did not need to be instructed. She lowered herself, and took his whole cock in. She slowly made love to it with her mouth with which she had so many thoughts about it, even with the help of a friend. At the end of their relationship they had come to realize that they still looked on each other with affection and love, and she had learned that, for some reason, now she had found it more to love him. He wanted to be happy, too, so he decided to just be happy.</p> <p>She made love to his penis for a minute or so, then stopped to take a few breaths. "I have to warn you, I'm really getting to like this," she said in a husky voice. She looked over and saw his expression of astonishment. "Look now!" she said, and smiled. Then she slid forward and pulled it all the way out of her mouth, licking the sensitive underside of it with her tongue until it was nearly like a tickle. "Mmm," she said, sucking on it—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
