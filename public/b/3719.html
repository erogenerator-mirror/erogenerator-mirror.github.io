"Come on inside and I'll pour you some drinks." I pointed to the little mini bar in the corner. She stood and took my hand pulling me towards it, she lead me up the stairs to the back, I thought I was going to fall on my knees. As she closed the door behind us I looked around. I stood in the middle of the room in a trance feeling as if I would be naked.</p> <p>She put her arms around me. She kissed me. Our kiss was soft and gentle. She pulled away from me and looked deep into my eyes. "My darling, will you please undress me?" She asked me as I started undoing the buttons on her clothes slowly undressing her. She turned to face me and my hands were moving to her back. I slowly undid the dress and it slid down over her smooth silky body. I knelt beside her placing my hands over her body. My hands were cupping her breasts as I kneaded the flesh softly. She pulled my shirt over my head I dropped my jeans leaving me standing in my boxers. I slowly lifted her up into the air and sat her back on the bed. With her legs spread on either side of my waist. I kissed her lips again I took her breasts into my hands and held them as I moved my kisses on down her body kissing each spot I had to kiss. I slid under the covers kissing her belly button as I moved lower. She pulled my face in her hands and pushed me down on to her. I lay down next to her and we started kissing again. Her hands went under my shirt and started to rub my stomach. "Will you let me make love with you?" She asked. I looked at her as she pulled off her own clothes. I could see her body, not as attractive and not as pretty. Her breasts were bigger than mine, with brown nipples, and her legs were long, just like mine they looked long and slim. She slid off her underwear and lay on top of me.</p> <p>Neither of us moved our mouths apart as our hands were making love to each other's bodies. Our movements became more vigorous as our kisses became more intense. Eventually our bodies moved, mine against hers. She rolled sideways and got on top of me. She kissed me again and then slid her lips down my body kissing and sucking my neck. She kissed her breasts up and down my stomach and between my legs. She looked into my eyes as she kissed me. I pushed my hips up to meet hers and she slid her hand down between my legs. She moved her lips to one side then the other. Our lovemaking had stopped and our heartbeats went in sync, as if from one long continuous beat. We were kissing passionately. Her tongue was still licking my lips. I took her hand and placed it inside me. I slid a finger inside her vagina. "I want to make love with you." I told her. She looked up at me. "I want to make love with you." she said and lowered herself onto me. The feel of her body on mine was like a bolt of bright light, I saw that she was beautiful and I felt excited. I pushed her up high against me, we felt a climax approaching. The feeling of a climax was as powerful as the feeling of sex, as if in love. We kissed hard as we continued to move together. Our passion was building, as if we were on a first date. I knew that after I made love with her I would never again be a virgin as she had been yesterday.</p> <p>"Do you want me" I whispered in her ear. She smiled and nodded yes, I continued kissing her lips till she could no longer take any more of our passion. "I want to make love to you, make love to you." I whispered in her ear as my penis rose inside her vagina. I felt her vagina as my penile length opened her up. I felt the warmth of her vagina as it opened to me. I felt her hips moving up a little pushing my penis in. We felt a warm feeling in the inside of her vagina as it closed. I knew the feeling of my penis as I felt how she moved inside my body. We were both being filled by our bodies. The sensation was incredible. My penis as hard in her vagina as it was when I had it in her, the pleasure was almost intolerable. She started to move on me and she lifted herself up and then dropped her body. My penis entered her again. We both let out a moan of pleasure as it filled her vagina. I reached one arm across her back and cupped her breasts as she sat up on my waist.</p> <p>"I am going to make love to you", she said as she kissed me hard, she kissed my neck. "Fuck me hard" she kissed my chest, as she continued her movement on me, her vagina opened as my penis entered it, "fuckâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
