I am always looking forward to that night's adventure in bed; all for me. The other men of our group have to suffer more than this, because of their cocks."</p> <p>"You could get carried away; all this stimulation and lust is turning me on."</p> <p>"We need to have a better opportunity in the future, so your husband has a choice. He could get a vasectomy or get a pill. The pill is very effective, you just need practice first. The last man you do this with might lose his cock in the next couple of years. He might even get to fuck a woman and then the pill would make him a little less virile."</p> <p>"I want a full life experience with my husband; it's something I've wanted for a long time."</p> <p>This last statement stunned me. "You can have a full life in the near future? How do you feel about that?"</p> <p>"It's exciting enough; this is a new experience for me. I feel free to let go, so to speak. But, you see, my wife is a little conservative."</p> <p>"She is?"</p> <p>"Yes, she is. The best kind of conservative. If she wants to get fucked in the ass, it would be a good thing. We have to make the best of it. If someone is on their way, it is ok to let him come into your pussy; as long as everything goes in the right direction."</p> <p>"That sounds like a big step for our marriage."</p> <p>"Yes, it does. It could be very dangerous, at first, for your husband, but if he starts to enjoy it, then it's not as bad as you think it would be."</p> <p>"Are you still excited about this?"</p> <p>"I'll tell you some time before I go into the hotel room. Let me know if you get a big boner in the next week."</p> <p>He smiled at me when he said his wife. It was almost like a big brother hug.</p> <p>Chapter 3</p> <p>Friday</p> <p>The next morning, I got up early because of some late appointments. I was a little early to go to work and to call the bank that I worked for. The first thing I said to my wife was, "You are a very nice wife today."</p> <p>That was followed by a giggle.</p> <p>"And you, you should always have a full life experience with your hubby."</p> <p>"You really mean that?"</p> <p>There was silence for a minute, then she said, "I love your friend, Tony, with all of the love he and I have for each other."</p> <p>We both giggled again, but not at the same time.</p> <p>I started with the usual conversation about the day's activities. I got up and walked around the apartment, but I didn't say anything about the man in the hotel room.</p> <p>"I want you to go get my clothes. You can keep me overnight."</p> <p>"I can take my clothes to my car and leave them there. They will go right into my purse. You will go get to work like you always do. I'm not going to take any of your money from you."</p> <p>This was not a problem if I said that it was. It was a requirement for me to go out to the car each trip and make sure, of course, that everything else he and his staff got was the right way. I went to get dressed and got dressed in the best I could in the lobby. Most of his uniform consisted of a couple of thin shirts of some size. I put the collar for the collar in a little bit of an unusual fashion. When I got to my car, I got a strange feeling. A feeling I hadn't felt in years. I started the car and turned back. A couple of things took my attention; one was the fact that the shirt was not made of anything; it was only three inches above the collar and back of the shirt button. It could barely be buttoned. What the hell was that?</p> <p>The other question was whether he had an erection. I could not tell, but I wondered if he had a stiffy.</p> <p>I got home and had to use the bathroom before I could go into my bed. There was a part of my body I could not put away. I was sure I could get him hard, if I wanted to.</p> <p>He came out with a pair of briefs as he came in.</p> <p>"Wow! That didn't sound right."</p> <p>"It was, but you should feel free to go use them." As he said that, he was unzipping his pants.</p> <p>"I'll keep them in case."</p> <p>He was looking very pleased as he went back in the bedroom.</p> <p>When he came back out, he looked backâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
