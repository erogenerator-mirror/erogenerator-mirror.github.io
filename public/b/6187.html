She cleared her throat, then walked towards her bedroom, making no attempt to hide her disappointment. "I'll do. But it's a pleasure to meet you... Miss."</p> <p>"And you, Miss. This is..." the young man paused as he saw the gorgeous woman standing by her desk. The two continued to hold hands and stare into each other's eyes even after she spoke.</p> <p>"I'll keep it a secret, dear." She said in a teasing and yet soft voice. "Miss, I would not leave it to become your lover if I did not at least want to kiss and hold you. Do you enjoy your pleasure?"</p> <p>Miss Kelly, who knew her husband's tastes, turned to his friend. "Mr. Hennessey, it would be a secret if you had to share a moment in your life with another human being. It was for me... It was really not meant to be." Without waiting for an answer, she reached up and pulled his shirt up over his head then tossed it away. "You were great, just perfect."</p> <p>"So are you, then." Hennessey replied just as warmly, with a twinkle in his eye. He smiled as he pulled off his shirt and let it drop to the floor. She eyed him with a twinkle in her eyes, her eyes moving lower as she took in more and more of his body. She was entranced by his hairless shoulders. She wondered if he had never shaved his hair or waxed them.</p> <p>Miss Kelly rose to the challenge, knowing she couldn't hold back her gaze. Her mouth watered as she saw the young man's naked torso beneath the white tank top. He didn't have a very large dick, but she always thought his body too pretty to be hidden by clothes. Miss Kelly pulled him down onto the bed with her. There was a large pillow under his head. As she laid back she could wait no longer. She beckoned to him. Hennessey had seen it before, in the last several seconds. He knew what to do with it. As he sat up, Miss Kelly lifted her skirt revealing a little strip of hair above her pink pussy. She spread her legs a bit to make it easier and the pink panties were even more revealing. Hennessey knelt on the floor in front of her, a finger running down her flat stomach and between her legs. His tongue darted across her thigh and he tasted her musky taste. It was so sweet and it took every ounce of control to keep from ripping her panties off with his teeth. Her thighs tensed as he ran his head up and down a few times, making her twitch. This was the closest to her orgasm she had ever had. Her husband had made her wait longer than it took him. She was too nervous to let him do this to her. She was on fire now, wanting so much just to have him inside of her. Her moans were rising and her body would soon respond if it did not have him. But now, it all felt so good, that she could take no more. "Hennessey, what now? What was so special about this? Is it something you want to do with me? It's very nice how you know how I like to taste you."</p> <p>His smile seemed to tell her everything. It was one that spoke volumes. She knew exactly what she wanted...</p> <p>Hennessey moved his head forward, kissing her pussy lips, her inner thighs, moving in closer and closer to her moist cleft with each passing second. He spread her lips with his thumbs and tasted her with his tongue. With his hands at her hips he pushed his tongue further and further inside of her. Her hips jerked again and she let out one final "ooh" and her pelvis flexed as she tried to match his pressure. Hennessey's tongue moved all around her opening. Licking her just like a cat was always pleasant, making her clench with more pleasure and then relax enough for him to slip in. He would not, after all, come. She wanted it to last as long as possible, he had waited all week for Miss Kelly to ask him to. But he needed to go further than just licks. He wanted to try something else before he sucked Miss Kelly all the way inside out.</p> <p>That one last part was even better than the first. Miss Kelly felt as though her head started spinning as Hennessey's tongue penetrated her. "Hennessey!"</p> <p>"Are you there?"</p> <p>"I need a little more... Miss."</p> <p>He lowered his head again and he began to lick the lips of Miss Kelly's love hole. She was so wet and he was so forceful as he probed his tongue against her. Her body jumped as he probed her hole, then tightened as he found her clitoris.
