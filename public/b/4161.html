I was going to do that, she was so gentle, but I was so eager to do it, all of a sudden she stepped back and stepped back, and it was all I could do is stand there and let her do what she wanted to do. She dropped to her knees and looked up at me, she just stared at me and her eyes opened wider than ever, and as her eyes closed I was just standing there and thinking, 'I'm going to fuck her.'</p> <p>It was all I could do to hold back for a little further look at her; there was nothing for me to be afraid of. She looked up at me and said, "You've got to be at least six feet tall." She leaned forward and kissed me just like that morning on the mouth! She looked at me questioningly for a moment, and then she leaned forward and kissed me softly on my lips, I looked at her and for just a moment, then I said, "I'm going to take a shower."</p> <p>She just smiled and said, "Take your shoes off." She just looked at me, and then she stood, walked over to the towel rack and got her shoes off, and as soon as she turned around she stepped into the shower again.</p> <p>"Wait," I said, but she just smiled and said "No, now go."</p> <p>I took my shoes and shirt off and walked back to the shower behind her, she stopped a few steps from me and then took her hands and pulled me against her from behind. I didn't resist, and she leaned back, and I put my arms around her and she started to move back and forth against me, then she leaned down and put her lips on mine and I put my hands on her ass and she started to kiss me again, just a light, brief kiss, but I did get a little tongue action in, and then she put her face on mine and we were kissing each other all over again. I had to do that with her to get my breath, I wanted her mouth to open more, and then I could kiss her just right.</p> <p>We kissed for several minutes, and then she said, "Let's get out of the shower."</p> <p>I just held her by the shoulders and said "Let's."</p> <p>I turned the water off and started to pull her up out of the shower, I took her into the opposite direction and then we got out of there, and when we got to the door we just stepped out of the shower and I said, "What are you doing?"</p> <p>She just looked at me and then said, "Don't touch me okay?"</p> <p>"Please." I said.</p> <p>She just smiled and turned around, and I took a step in so our bodies were just inches from hers. When she looked back at me I could just see the side of her nipple under the bar of her dress, and I was wondering if I'd lost control, but I was sure I was going to take my chances. She just smiled, and stepped toward the door.</p> <p>When we stepped out of the shower I stepped into my shorts and pulled the door closed, we turned and walked toward the door together. As we left I stepped up to her and said, "Let's keep going."</p> <p>Just then the door burst open; we both almost ran out of the bathroom; as we went through the doorway I stopped her and said, "No."</p> <p>"Okay," and she just smiled.</p> <p>It was just me and her, but then she said, "Let's do that again, and we'll see how long it takes, okay?" and with that she turned around and we went into the master bedroom.</p> <p>Her room was not as big as the one I had at her place, but it was bigger that her bedroom. There was a king-size bed, and just a few chairs and a desk top and a couch and the bathroomâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
