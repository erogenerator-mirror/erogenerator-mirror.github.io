I wanted to feel her. I wanted her mouth. I wanted to taste her. I wanted to kiss her. I want to taste her.</p> <p>And on top, I wanted access to her body.</p> <p>I couldn't imagine that she'd be willing to share this with me for as long as she was willing to make the commitment we had to each other. And I didn't want to be the only one to experience this and to be part of it.</p> <p>I kissed her.</p> <p>I kissed her lips. I kissed her mouth. And by this point, I'd had enough. This couldn't go another day.</p> <p>I turned her around.</p> <p>Locked arms around her neck, I kissed the nape of her neck, and it only served to raise her desire even higher.</p> <p>Her scent. Her skin. And her arms.</p> <p>She turned around as I slid between her legs.</p> <p>She pulled away from my mouth, but only long enough for me to say "You're beautiful."</p> <p>Her head swiveled and she arched her spine to give me more of her.</p> <p>"Turn on the shower." I commanded her.</p> <p>She leaned against the mirrored shower wall and I kissed her deeply, our tongues interlaced for a moment.</p> <p>I let her hands slide down my bare chest, and across my abs, and back up again, down to my arms to do as she'd done a hundred times before.</p> <p>My hands reached around from this point, and I lifted both her tugs, and slid off the bar.</p> <p>"On your feet," I said. "On the couch."</p> <p>She got to her feet, and I lifted her t-shirt over her head. I loved the sound of it before it joined the pool on the floor. I ran my hands up her front and back, then cupped both her breasts. They were as soft as I'd ever remembered them being.</p> <p>I took her hard, nipple in my mouth and began a slow exploration of her breast.</p> <p>I wanted to do this and I was going to. I couldn't wait to.</p> <p>"Do you want another taste of it?" I asked as my hands went down and I rubbed the nub of her pussy over my lips.</p> <p>"Yes sir," she breathed.</p> <p>And yes it was.</p> <p>And she wanted more. She was almost frantic and her hips began to move with the rhythm of my attentions.</p> <p>"Touch me," I said in a husky voice. "Touch me and make me touch you."</p> <p>We made the first move, and I went down on her, but as I did, her arms flew out from my neck and up, and into my hair.</p> <p>I pressed her mouth against mine, and I knew what we both wanted.</p> <p>I kissed her.</p> <p>Her tongue slipped out to meet mine, and I was overwhelmed by her taste, the sweetness of this beautiful woman; of this soft and feminine essence which could be mine forever.</p> <p>And she was mine.</p> <p>I opened my eyes just then, and I saw she wasn't looking me in the eye, but I also had the knowledge as to what had happened to her this morning.</p> <p>She looked happy, and this was not a sad moment that you could tell.</p> <p>I pulled her to me once again, kissing her mouth, her face, and her breasts.</p> <p>I took her face in my hands. Her eyes were heavy and wild, and there was nothing left in me to hold her. I could feel her legs parting, wanting more.</p> <p>"Take me." I said.</p> <p>A moment later, I was stripping off her clothes, the feeling of the night air on my naked body, my hands all over her. Our lips still locked in a kiss.</p> <p>I began to kiss and caress my way down her body, stopping only to take in her beautiful beauty, the beauty which was mine.</p> <p>My hands ran over her thighs and hips, then down her legs until I had the pleasure of fondling the insides of her thighs. She was all woman.</p> <p>I looked down at her, and I felt my heart skip a beat because of the look on her faceâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
