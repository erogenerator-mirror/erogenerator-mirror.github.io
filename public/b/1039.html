We didn't bother going to my room, but instead I decided to change clothes until I was dressed properly. I dressed and walked back to her room. She opened the bathroom door when she heard my footsteps, opened the door, and sat on the toilet.</p> <p>It was one thing for me to be naked in front of her. It was another thing entirely to feel my erection pressing against her thigh. It wasn't long before I found her feet pressing against my thighs, and when I kissed her neck her nipples were poking through her thin nightshirt.</p> <p>As we neared the end of the hallway, she stopped and stared at me and smiled. "Do you want to go up to the cabin today? Do you want to go out to lunch or do you want to go to bed?"</p> <p>I thought it the most direct question I could possibly ask. "Yes, I want to go back to the cabin. I want to eat with a woman tonight."</p> <p>She smiled at that. "I think that would be a nice way to show I'm ready for anything."</p> <p>"What do you want?"</p> <p>"Just... to walk around naked, to touch each other, to touch each other."</p> <p>"I think that would be lovely, if you feel comfortable."</p> <p>"I think it wouldn't be too uncomfortable."</p> <p>"Then, I'm your friend, and it would be okay."</p> <p>"Okay. You're so kind, and I'm so glad you like my outfit. It is lovely as you said, but I wouldn't want that right now."</p> <p>"I don't mind, but I feel awkward sharing a friend with a man who's not you, at least not yet." So there was nothing we could do next as we approached the cabin. She took my hand and led me toward the open door.</p> <p>The cabin was really a two-bedroom unit. The cabin was surrounded by trees and trees. As we continued to walk down the path, she pulled aside her nightshirt for me. I smiled and kissed her neck. "I've always been such a gentleman," I whispered, and I kissed her again. She responded in kind and we both turned as the path wound on its course. I took one hand and helped her up, but then we stopped and walked a short distance toward the cabin door.</p> <p>It was only when we stood outside that she said, "You're such a gentleman, and such a gentleman." She looked me over as she opened the door and we stepped inside. I had a few things to say, so I waited.</p> <p>She had a big bed and a sofa so she went in and put things on it. She came out wearing a short robe, and sat down on the sofa. Then when the mood struck her, she walked over to me and stood in front of me. "Let me get naked and we'll shower together."</p> <p>"That sounds like a good idea. I certainly would like a shower."</p> <p>When I stood up, she smiled. "You're the most handsome one I've ever seen, when you say that. Are you ready?"</p> <p>"Yes, do you want to kiss me?"</p> <p>"All right," she said, and in a few seconds we broke apart and kissed deeply. She ran her hand down my chest and then down to my cock. "This morning was pretty wonderful. I have a feeling I'll never forget it. Just wait, we've got all afternoon."</p> <p>With that, she removed her nightshirt and climbed on to the bed and then lay down on her back. Then she moved toward me and kissed me. "My turn."</p> <p>I began. First, I kissed her throat and her collar bone, working my way up until I felt her body heat and then, finally, my mouth found her lips. I pulled her close, feeling for the first time that she was naked beneath me. When I got to the top of her chest, her nipples were already hard, and I continued working my way down, spending a good five minutes kissing her breasts and then kissing her pussy.</p> <p>She opened her sweet lips for me and I slid two fingers into her pussy. She was already very wet from the juices we had gathered on the beach and her pussy was already swollen and ready. When I felt her muscles tighten around my fingers and my tongue, I felt my orgasm approaching. I decided to speed up the action.</p> <p>I kissed my way up to her mouth and once again was surprised when she took my cock in between her lips. She was sucking me hard, bobbing her head up and down my length, sliding her lips up and down my cock. It was wonderful. I was holding onto her head firmly with both hands, and she didn't seem to mind. I had never experienced anything like it before.</p> <p>I felt her fingernâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
