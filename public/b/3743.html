If your name would be here I wouldn't think so."</p> <p>"Why would you think that?"</p> <p>"Oh, well, maybe it's just that I was wondering how he ended up here and what happened at the house. I guess it's a shame they were not in his room."</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"Well, he would have been in one of those rooms or in bed or something. I was wondering what his name is."</p> <p>"Oh, I see. And who is he anyway?"</p> <p>"Steve's name is Henry."</p> <p>Jaz laughed at that. Then she said, "Well, that's probably because of who he is."</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>She hesitated.</p> <p>"Do you mean what I think you think?"</p> <p>"You don't think I'm going to use that word on him? No, I don't think so."</p> <p>Jaz rolled her eyes. "No, I don't think so. It's not like you're gonna use that word on anyone."</p> <p>"Not with me."</p> <p>"Not at all. No, I mean with you. I don't think he's all that bad, either."</p> <p>"Well, I guess that's something else. I mean, he could do what he needs to do. But, I'll never know if he's good enough for you. I don't know anything about boys."</p> <p>"Maybe it's because you can't see them, or maybe it's because I find them rather sexy."</p> <p>"Honey, that's not true."</p> <p>"Maybe. I don't see them. But I know more about them."</p> <p>She paused, then put her arm in mine to push me up so our heads were in front.</p> <p>"And you, you don't see your girlfriend, do you?"</p> <p>"She doesn't show up. And I don't see her either. She goes to the club every weekend, and she makes no appearance at all. Just for that, yes, she's my girlfriend, and yes, she can do whatever she likes. And, what's more, you wouldn't be the only person she's seeing, but I'd want to know for sure."</p> <p>"What do you mean by that?"</p> <p>"Why does she come and stay with you? No, that's not what I'm talking about. As for the other girlfriend, I don't know about the other girls. Sure, I see her, all the time. And, even if she doesn't do anything when she comes to stay here, I don't see them. I see the way you two are together and the way you look at each other." She stopped pushing me and turned us sideways so she had a full view of my boobs. We laughed but it was more to try and pull her attention away from my big boobs than in any sort of sexual interest.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"You're right, I'm right as well. Look, you already know about the other girlfriends, but what does that say about me?"</p> <p>"Huh? Well, that's what I mean, is it? The other girlfriends just don't notice the girls? No, I guess it's not exactly true."</p> <p>"No, that's not the case. Some of them are like that; some of them are pretty good looking, but most of them aren't really interested in me or that I'm there, you know."</p> <p>"Then what is it?"</p> <p>"Well, they all find you funny and they all try to act like you're some sort of celebrity. That's why I'm trying to talk to you about it."</p> <p>"Okay, I guess...how about this? Do you always like my boobs?"</p> <p>"Well, not always, maybe." She turned her back to me when she said that, and I just stood there staring at them. "But, not usually, you know."</p> <p>"And what do you mean?"</p> <p>"No, not always, but sometimes. And it can be hard to tell all the time. And, sometimes I don't know. Sometimes one or the other of them looks really happy. Other times they don't even know you. Some of them don't know that you're the other girlfriend or that you're in your own fantasy world."</p> <p>"But, I don't know anything about what you are talking about."</p> <p>She looked at me, smiled back, and said, "Well you sure aren't going to ask me to call you, are you?"</p> <p>She turned back to me and said, "Well, I guess I'll know more about you later. I'm sure you can figure anything out in my head."</p> <p>"Well, you're right and Iâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
