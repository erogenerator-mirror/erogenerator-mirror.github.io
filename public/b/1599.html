She asked, staring at my hand as if trying to read me.</p> <p>"It would make me nervous, but I guess things have to be done right. We were going to have to be more careful here before I can say anything to you. We could be in danger, but we didn't know that. We'll have to keep our secrets safe, at least until we get our heads straight." I said as honestly as I could, as if I was considering this whole 'guys' thing. She shook her head, looking over at the couch where the last of her friends were waiting, not looking right back at me. She smiled to herself, and that was all the encouragement she needed.</p> <p>"Okay, you can go now," she said, stepping away as her friends began to leave.</p> <p>"Wait," I said as I caught my breath, "I'll talk to you later." I pulled her down for a hug.</p> <p>"I feel so stupid. Don't think I'm a little drunk or anything, but I'm actually surprised," she said as she kissed my shoulder.</p> <p>"Yeah," I said, "it really is a bit forward for friends to hang out with their friends, and I know I'm not that far up the world, but it's my time of the month, so I guess I'm just on your side of the world, so to speak." She grabbed my hand as I walked me to the door, and I let go of her hand as I kissed her cheek, before stepping in her door frame. "Bye!" I said to her as she locked it. I walked the few steps down to her house, and then stopped beside the door so I could knock on it without being heard. She took it off, so I knocked a second time, just as she started to turn around.</p> <p>"Oh!" she said as she saw me standing near her door and she grabbed my shoulder to pull me in. "I'll make it up to you, won't I?" she said as she turned around and threw me over her shoulder, and then kissed me again.</p> <p>"No. You stay here, I'll go and put the groceries away, and we'll talk after your parents get home. That's good for you." She said as she looked me up and down.</p> <p>"I have a little bit of homework that needs to be done, but you're the one that's liable to keep me occupied for most of the time. It'll be a while." I said, as I kissed her again, and put the dishes away while she got dressed in her bedroom. She got my shoes and socks, and put the rest in the dryer. She walked me back to the house, and then got her keys from the dryer and unlocked my front door without asking me. As she said we had time to talk about any future plans for the weekendâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
