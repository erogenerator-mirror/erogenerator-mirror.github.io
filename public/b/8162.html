Then we were kissing again. Lacey could feel my dick pulsing and swelling as I moved my hips to rub it back and forth between her pussy lips.</p> <p>We kissed each other long and hard.</p> <p>We were totally and totally together again as our bodies became one, I held her tightly and I kissed her as passionately as she always had.</p> <p>I slowly moved my hips to rub back and forth against her pussy as her hands pulled at my chest.</p> <p>I could feel the cum boiling back up inside me and I knew that I couldn’t hold out much longer.</p> <p>Lacey started moving her hips to rub my cock around her pussy lips. I moved one hand to her ass and I grabbed her ass with my thumb and forefinger.</p> <p>As Lacey continued to rub my dick as it moved back and forth between her pussy lips I got bolder.</p> <p>I pulled my mouth away from hers and I reached down and put a finger up on her clit and teased it at first.</p> <p>I felt Lacey’s hips start to grind again as she responded like crazy now. She was driving herself against me with reckless abandon and it made me want her even more.</p> <p>I got bolder and moved my hand to her ass now and I started rubbing her asshole with my middle finger again.</p> <p>I looked deeply into her face and saw the expression of excitement and joy.</p> <p>I moved my finger up and down her ass crack until it was rubbing her asshole. She moved very slowly now, pushing back against it until both of her ass cheeks were pushed against my fingers.</p> <p>As she ground against my finger her body began to jerk. I took the opportunity to put a couple of more fingers up her ass.</p> <p>She felt very different because we had never been fucked in this position, but my dick was so wet from rubbing against her clit that it had slipped straight down.</p> <p>I reached down between us with one hand and slowly circled my finger around her tight little opening.</p> <p>“Yeah,” she said, “finger my ass.”</p> <p>I put two fingers in her pussy and finger fucked her ass. I was now all the way in and I stopped pulling my cock from her pussy just long enough to slide my hand back up. I felt her clench around my fingers.</p> <p>It was the kind of reaction that I needed to get her to orgasm. I began to move my hips with the motion of mine.</p> <p>She kept pressing down on my finger as she felt the orgasm coming on.</p> <p>Her pussy began to squeeze a little harder as my finger pressed deeper up her ass.</p> <p>She moved her head down to mine and we just kissed and I kissed her neck and then reached down and cupped both of her ass cheeks with my right hand, pulling her against me more firmly.</p> <p>“Oh, yeah, that feels great,” she growled. My hand now began to move with faster speed.</p> <p>I felt her asshole clench again as she came. She pushed hard back against me with every contraction of her muscles. She was so tight I was afraid to pull out of her if she really started to get worked up again.</p> <p>I just kept right on fingering her tight ass as she continued to orgasm.</p> <p>Her pussy kept twitching and clenching around my finger as I continued to pull it back and forth in her ass.</p> <p>Lacey was grinding hard against my hand and she kept cumming almost continuously.</p> <p>I think she was trying to suck and squeeze my cock even more. She seemed to be in a constant state of arousal as the heat from her pussy was starting to intensify through her body.</p> <p>I couldn’t—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
