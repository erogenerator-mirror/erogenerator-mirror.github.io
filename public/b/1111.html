I mean... you're just..."</p> <p>"That's what we're doing isn't it?" He looked up and saw her grinning earbuds in her ear. "I said we were going to have a talk."</p> <p>"So?"</p> <p>"So..." his voice trailed off.</p> <p>"Well... it's not going to be that easy. I've... I've got issues with you, too."</p> <p>"I know. That's why we're going to have a talk," he said.</p> <p>"That's why we're coming over," she reminded him. "We've been hanging out."</p> <p>"Yeah," he said. "But I gotta say, I'm kinda nervous about what's going on between us."</p> <p>He sighed in frustration. This wasn't what he'd had planned—the first time he'd had sex without a condom. There was one thing he always wanted to do, and it was with Erin that was definitely going to have to wait. He wanted her, not a disease thing.</p> <p>"Don't worry," she assured him. "We're not going to just sit here and talk," she told him, turning back around.</p> <p>"And when we're here... I don't even know if we're going to fuck," he offered, although he already knew the answer.</p> <p>"I'm sure it's going to be a lot, but not a lot, too," she reassured him. "I'm sure we can't rush anything though—we're only a few minutes from the apartment, after all."</p> <p>He laughed. "I'm not complaining though."</p> <p>"I'm serious. Do you want to talk about it?"</p> <p>"Why don't I get your stuff and we talk in the car while we both calm down?" she suggested. "I have a couple of things to get my mind off, but I'll do your stuff."</p> <p>He turned off the music and got his things out from inside the closet... It made him think back to the conversation they'd had just before he'd left—he felt like she had more of a crush on him than he had anticipated—and he didn't even know what she was going to be like when they talked it over. He also didn't know if she was attracted to him... but she was pretty friendly with the first half of her family, but he knew she was pretty reserved about getting to know him. He didn't know if she was going to act on it or if she was going to act on it.</p> <p>"Erin..." he began.</p> <p>"Come on, honey," she said, turning out the light, but looking at him with lust-filled eyes. "My place is fifteen minutes away," she said with a wink.</p> <p>"Okay..."</p> <p>"Okay. Come on... let's get you into that bedroom," she said, taking his hand and leading him back towards the living room.</p> <p>It was almost like a movie in his head that night... it made him feel as though he had been waiting for that night to come around for centuries.</p> <p>"Now why are we sitting here?" she asked him when they got to his door. She was smiling, and he'd been sitting there listening to the music but now she was leading him to her apartment, and when she opened the door he couldn't take his eyes off of her. She was wearing just a little blue negligee that just barely covered her nipples. It came down to just below her waist, and a few inches below her belly button. The material was a thin stretch of fabric that clung to her body when she moved. She had one leg outstretched, and another just slightly crossed at the knee, just looking out to the street. He almost felt as if she was trying to tempt him with her legs and a few inches of exposed flesh... but he couldn't just come sit there and look.</p> <p>"What are you doing, Mr. T," she asked when he stepped inside, taking his hand to lead him.</p> <p>"I was just waiting to see if you were nervous," he tried to explain.</p> <p>"No. Not at all," she assured him. "I've been thinking about it for almost a half hour and it's time for us to go."</p> <p>He didn't bother with excuses; he just took her hand and led her towards her door.</p> <p>Just as they were about to step inside, she pressed up against him. He could feel the warmth on his cheek as she bent to kiss him.</p> <p>"What's this all about," she asked when the kiss ended, but she didn't pull away this time. "We're talking here."</p> <p>He didn't know what came over him, but he didn't have anything to say to her, especially when she didn't pull away this time.
