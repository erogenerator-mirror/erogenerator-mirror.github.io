The way he was smiling said it all. I looked at him again and he had that evil grin again.</p> <p>"Come on. I'll get the coffee started," He said as he stepped from the bathroom. I got up, and he just followed me into the kitchen.</p> <p>"Are you enjoying the view?" I asked as my body swayed as I walked.</p> <p>"H-ha... it's so beautiful, but we're going to have to see how the day goes." He said with a laugh. I grinned at that too.

He had no objection, as he started to fondle both my breasts. The night before, I had to take care of Mr. P. with his mouth, with his hands. The sensation was so wonderful, and I was already horny. Then, he mounted me, and I felt his hard cock go in and out of me. It wasn't too long before he started to cum. We kissed, as his cock pumped my wet pussy full of cum. I opened my legs wide to let him do me better. We both came, and it was a very nice thing to feel good.
