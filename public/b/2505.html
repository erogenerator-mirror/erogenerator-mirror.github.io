I'm so embarrassed. What's wrong with me?"</p> <p>"You don't seem to know," I said, "If you want a hug, just ask."</p> <p>Amy gave me one of her little brother hugs and I could feel her body quivering beneath mine. I kissed her forehead and asked, "How long have you been like this?"</p> <p>"Fourteen years," she responded, "I don't want to be this way again."</p> <p>"Do you want to stay like that forever?" I asked.</p> <p>"Do I?" she asked looking up at me.</p> <p>I kissed her and she returned it with one of her own. Her body was tense, her legs were trembling and her nipples were hard little points. Amy started to run her fingers through my chest hair. "We have time," she said, "I want to show you what love is."</p> <p>Her hand moved down to rub and rub my penis, and it felt like it was going to spring free at any second. Finally, the thought crossed my mind.</p> <p>"Oh Amy, I'm really sorry," I said, and then started to run my hands down her side, to her ribs and belly button. She stopped me as I moved the last couple of inches down a little further. "I'm sorry."</p> <p>"You have nothing to apologize for," she responded and looked into me, "The kiss will be fantastic, all the way up to the bone."</p> <p>"Is that what that was?" I asked.</p> <p>"Don't you remember?" she asked and gave me a kiss on the lips, "We were both scared."</p> <p>"Yes, that was very different than it was for me," I told her and kissed her again, this time her lips were softer and it felt as though our tongues were doing crazy things.</p> <p>It was all I could do to stop and lean back, so we were still sitting on my bed. Amy broke the kiss. "You're right," she replied, "I don't remember much about it. We used to kiss and make love all the time. There were times I couldn't breathe but there was one time I had one of those, and I didn't want to stop. We used to make passionate love too.</p> <p>"You don't have to if you don't want to, but I just wanted to keep it going for as long as we could. I would lay on my back and you put your head between my legs and it just seemed natural to do it. I have never seen anybody make love like that. I still remember every touch."</p> <p>When I was in all this I had no idea what she was feeling, but I just kept kissing her and she seemed to feel the same way. When she came back to reality I said, "I am sorry that we made love, but this was amazing. You are the most beautiful woman I know."</p> <p>"Thank you for being who you are, and if you ever want to hear about making love again, you should feel free to contact me," she said, "You are a treasure!"</p> <p>"I'll talk to you," I said and smiled.</p> <p>Amy asked me if I wanted her to take her shirt off and I hesitated, but after a minute she did it, "You really don't know what to do," she said and smiled at me.</p> <p>When I took the shirt off that day I was happy to see that Amy looked even more beautiful than she did the day before. She was standing there looking into my eyes. Her hair was a mess, but she had obviously been crying.</p> <p>"I wanted you to know that," she said and looked at me with her face in the corner of her eyes, "Your eyes were smiling."</p> <p>For the next several years we just sat on the edge of my bed and talked and read and watched movies. Even her husband had a crush on her. She was always a very sexual being and I think he knew the whole world had fallen apart until he left her. As I got older, so did Amy, but she wanted to do more than just lay with me. Amy was really into sex, and it was very easy when she would suck me off. Her husband was an avid student of human sexuality, and he didn't know it, but Amy seemed to be a passionate lover.</p> <p>We were both married by then, and I thought I would just do whatever she wanted, right and wrong. However, once I realized that I didn't have anyone I wanted to do anything about it, I got angry.
