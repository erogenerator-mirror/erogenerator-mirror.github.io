"What was that? Did you come?"</p> <p>"Yeah, yeah I did," said Tom, looking down in his lap. "Did it turn you on?"</p> <p>"You know it did...it made me want to...I just got carried away for a moment...but I couldn't stop myself."</p> <p>I didn't tell him that my panties had become soaked with my juices and that, yes, I'd touched myself as well. Then I leaned back and reached for my clothes.</p> <p>"Are you OK?" I asked him. "Did your mom get mad at you?"</p> <p>"Hell yeah!" he said as he started to pick up his shirt and shorts.</p> <p>"Don't worry," I said. "I'll be here. I'll fix your breakfast!" And with that I turned and ran upstairs.</p> <p>After getting dressed - I had to admit it took all my self control to put on my panties and leave - we made love that night. That would have been the ultimate experience but, as it was, it was too much. We were both very excited at the thought of what we'd do for the next day. It was so easy to just go for it, knowing that it had happened the very first moment we stepped outside. And I just couldn't wait.</p> <p>We never did make it to the beach; just stayed on the boat naked and watched the other boats go by. Tom was going on and on about his future as the owner of a successful restaurant. I decided, if we couldn't go to his wedding, then he and I could go to mine. And the idea of taking that chance again just wouldn't happen to be the right way.</p> <p>It was like it happened to me all over again: a year later, during a visit to my mother in law, Tom and I did a little shopping. We bought a few things but there wasn't anything to wear. Our clothes and shoes were all very expensive and, as far as I'm concerned, we'd better put that away now.</p> <p>We went out to dinner but then, after we'd paid, we sat at a small table together and waited. For what seemed like an hour, we talked while we ate, our hands frequently touching and moving over each other. I thought about the things we'd done the night before - from being a model and then going to bed with a beautiful and sensual wife.</p> <p>It was all terribly exciting and it made me wonder if our love might have gone further. I was sure that we might have kissed and touched each other, just like we had all night. And of course, I was so wet that it was almost funny watching me go from being quite mad at Tom and now wanting him more than ever. I wanted my little sister in law to be as wild as she was.</p> <p>And just as I was wondering if I should leave, Tom reached down and pulled me to him.</p> <p>"Hey...there's a reason I wanted to leave before."</p> <p>I turned and gave him my best seductive look and, to my surprise, our eyes met and locked...as though they had crossed for the world in that instant.</p> <p>To Be Continuedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
