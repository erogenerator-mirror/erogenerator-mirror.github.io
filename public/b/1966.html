Finally, I managed to say, "Thank you; I've never met anybody so...so...so...familiar with love."</p> <p>I moved slowly, and I could see she was smiling. Then I turned around and we embraced. With one hand, I took her face, and the other hand, I caressed her ass. My touch gave her a shiver, and a shiver seemed to pulse between us.</p> <p>"Oh, God!" she said. "I need you inside me!"</p> <p>"And I need to be inside you tonight!" I moaned. "I've wanted you so badly!"</p> <p>"Gods, yes," she said. "But right now, I need you so badly!"</p> <p>I held her close. The feel of her breasts as she rested her head on my shoulder made me crazy, and I kissed her neck and shoulder. I kept whispering, my hands moving on her back, up and down...sometimes slipping up her spine and sometimes between her legs to rub the inside of her thighs....</p> <p>Then, I felt her lips on my ear. "Now, Mike...now!"</p> <p>My hands began to probe gently, to feel how she would respond to my touch. I heard her breath catch, even as her teeth dug lightly. A second and third time, I got the message. She'd become so damn wet, and I moved up toward her...but a third kiss on her mouth made me doubt it, so I stopped and said, "Wait."</p> <p>She turned, and looked in amazement at the large strap-on dildo. She couldn't believe what she'd been thinking of the very first night...how we'd been so intimate. Not a word had been said about how we'd consummated our relationship. No hesitation for this night, no hesitation for me, only, here. Now she'd been able to ask...to give me the answer, and be able to say anything. She'd asked!</p> <p>I got down on my knees and began kissing her thighs. The smell of her sex was intoxicating. I kissed up her thigh and could taste her skin. She took my head against her thigh, and I began to kiss back down again. I knew now what she wanted...what she needed. I parted her pussy with my tongue and began to lick slowly around the outer lips of her womanhood. First the wet flesh, all around her clit, then back again. She was groaning, and I put two fingers in her as I tongued her pussy lips. I felt her thighs quiver, as if she was close to a climax. I slipped a third finger out, and slowly began to probe deeper...and deeper...and deeper. After a few minutes, she moaned, "No, wait a minute." She pushed my head away. "Please! I'm so wet and so swollen; it...it's beautiful!"</p> <p>She wanted more. I looked around. We were lying next to each other on the floor, her thigh against mine, her hand on mine. I took my wet, juicy finger, and slowly slid it inside her. My whole body spasmed as I felt her clit against my thumb, and the little nub seemed to throb inside my palm as it slid inside her. She took the finger back into her mouth and closed her eyes for a minute, and then leaned toward me and pushed her mouth onto mine. I slid my tongue into her mouth, and began to lick her with the tip of my tongue...and with the whole of my tongue. She moaned, her face turned to the side, and she began to thrust her hips into my hand, humping the air. I began to fuck her again, and she moaned. I stopped when I felt her body begin to quiver, and she put one foot down again as she tried to spread herself open so more of me could enter her.</p> <p>Suddenly, she pulled herself up, her eyes wide. "You're beautiful; so hot...so hungry!"</p> <p>After several minutes, she pulled herself away from me and took the toy with her. I couldn't take my eyes off her. "Oh....my! It's...it's like....I'm just not sure, Mike, the thing is huge!"</p> <p>She had it just in the way she could take. Her eyes were wild with anticipation. "I've seen it before...lots of time...lots of people...but with someone..." She held the toy up over her clitoris. "The big, hard thing...is inside me now, Mike."</p> <p>I couldn't even breathe, and knew I was going to explode in my pants. I'd never done anything like this, and I was afraid I would explode right there in her arms. I slid another finger inside her as I licked and kissed her.
