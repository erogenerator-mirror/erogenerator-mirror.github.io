I mean, right before Christmas... you were dressed up as an angel... and then your clothes were on... and then you had on black silk panties and a camisole all together... and even black stockings and garter... and then it was finally time for a wedding ceremony...</p> <p>'C'mon... we'll do this as a marriage ceremony... you looked like you could have a big wedding to you....'</p> <p>A couple of seconds later, a naked man came up behind me. He stood there, inches from my back. He started to talk to me.</p> <p>'I think there is a small difference between us, isn't there? Why would you want to be my wife after all these years... when I could be your husband and it would be as plain as day? What the hell can I say to prove the point? You aren't one for small talk... you're too cute! Now turn around and get your hands behind your back....'</p> <p>I turned around, and he was grinning. Then he started to say one thing, and I started to get my head in his hands.......</p> <p>"That's it baby... turn around."</p> <p>I turned around, and he was looking at me...</p> <p>"Look at me... you looked so beautiful when we.... we were making love."</p> <p>I turned around, and he was staring at my face....</p> <p>"I'm not going to cheat on my baby..." he said softly. "The least you can do is let me love you as long as I can...."</p> <p>I didn't say anything.... I didn't want to....</p> <p>"What did you say? " he asked.</p> <p>"I said, that it's about time we had a... one night stand... "</p> <p>"I said... " as he put the words in his mouth, a little faster. They were like a dance....</p> <p>"Oh baby.... come with me.... we can go and get a table, and..."</p> <p>He was starting to get turned on....</p> <p>"Baby.... come with me...."</p> <p>But when we got to the table, the tables weren't big, and we had to sit down....</p> <p>"Why don't we go to the dance club, honey... it has a little dance floor...... but first, we need to get something on my plane.... now, I want to... and...."</p> <p>Then there was that smile...</p> <p>"Okay... but I wanna fuck... as long as I get this chance."</p> <p>I was starting to get turned on... when he kissed me...</p> <p>"No," he said. "We can't..... if we want to fuck .... "</p> <p>His arms went around and pulled me close...</p> <p>"You're crazy... that's not true...."</p> <p>"Okay.... I told you...."</p> <p>He was smiling.... he had me convinced.....</p> <p>'Look... you're all I thought about for a long time... I thought about just... taking a chance. I didn't think you would really go for this... but that's what people do.... I'd just never go there. It's not like I'm a stranger.... not now....'</p> <p>"You're right.... you shouldn't...."</p> <p>I was right....</p> <p>His mouth went down and we kissed.... He put his hands on my hips and started to kiss me down.... I moved my hands over his shoulders....</p> <p>"You think you're so good... I'm glad I'm not your baby...."</p> <p>I moved my hands up and slowly, slowly, I slid my hands down his chest, then down again... down again.....</p> <p>"Stop, stop...."</p> <p>He raised his hands...</p> <p>"I said stop. I told you I don't."</p> <p>He was smirking from ear to ear...</p> <p>"Just shut up and let me love you... I know it's not you...."</p> <p>A few seconds later our lips met....</p> <p>"You'll be disappointed with that one..."</p> <p>"I'll be disappointed," I said.</p> <p>"Yes.... yes.... I've wanted this all along... I've wanted you...."</p> <p>Then he was saying, "I need to...".</p> <p>"Yeah.... come out here.... "</p> <p>With a grin he followed me out....</p> <p>We had both come up, and he looked me dead in the eyes....</p> <p>"That's right... that's what you want, right?"</p> <p>Just like that....</p> <p>"Oh yeah, I want that...."</p> <p>Just like that, with that grin, I moved my hands down....</p> <p>... then slowly ran them up his sides, over his torso.... he looked very surprised...</p> <p>"No.... no...."</p> <p>He was grinningâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
