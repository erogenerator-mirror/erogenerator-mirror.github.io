Her body and her breasts were like fine china dolls, her nipples hard little stones. She was kneeling, her left foot flat, her right knee bent, her fingers clasped at her waist. Her eyes were closed and she was breathing slowly, deeply. Her breasts were small, just the smallest of those I think were normal to begin with, but they were already rising and falling with each breath. I stared down at the soft black pubic hair that surrounded her navel, the soft curly hairs that made up her pubic forest were like silk, and she was completely hairless. She held her hands to her sides at her sides, one hand held her right breast. The other hand went to her pussy, where she was slowly masturbating her clit.</p> <p>I reached out, my fingers brushed her clit, and she jerked. I looked up at her, and she opened her eyes momentarily.</p> <p>"You like that," she whispered. "How you like it when I fuck your pussy."</p> <p>I just stared. I wanted her so bad. Her hand continued to work her clit, circling it, circling and pressing, pressing her fingers firmly onto her clit. Her face was a contorted expression of pleasure. Her fingers dipped slightly into her vagina, and she pushed against them. I just wanted to touch her, to feel her. I wanted to touch her so bad. I wanted to touch her pussy. I wanted to see her face, to kiss her. For some minutes I just sat there, taking it all in. Finally, I leaned over her, putting my face near her and kissed her hard and full on the mouth.</p> <p>She started breathing very heavily, and I pulled back, and then pushed my hands into her panties away from her. She lifted her ass and helped me ease her panties off. Her body was trembling as I lifted and held her legs. I pulled them over her heels, she lifted her ass as I pushed them over her feet. Both feet were bare, and I bent down with her, bringing her on my lap with a hand in each end.</p> <p>I lowered her down onto my hard cock, and she let out a soft sigh. I was still holding her legs over my hands as I started to move my hips up and down on her. She looked at me through her lust filled eyes, and my lips found hers and we lay together on the couch. We kissed again, long kisses that would last. I moved to put my arms up around her waist just below her breasts. Her breasts were perfect. Full, with a large dark pink areola that were just about perfect. The nipples were large, the size of small strawberries. I kissed her again, and she wrapped her arms tight around my neck. The sound of the soft sound of our kissing was filling my ears all over. Our faces moved closer together as I kept fucking her. My pelvis rocked off the couch, her back against the cushion. Each time I pushed and pulled into her she would lift her hips into me.</p> <p>"You fuck like a man," she whispered, and then she looked at me and smiled, "and you like to fuck like a girl too; this is what I want," she said, "to feel what it's like to cum. Is that bad?" she asked, her eyes bright and glistening with sweat.</p> <p>"No, I just think she's beautiful. She's so cute and you're so sexy," I told her. I lifted her head up, and stared at her.</p> <p>"Your turn," she said, and I lifted her up from my lap. She sat up on me, and then lay back. We kissed for a while again as she spread her legs and I put my cock back into position. I looked down at her as I slid forward, and her eyes were still closed. I began to pump my cock in and out of her pussy, moving against her, and getting every last inch into her. When I felt her start to move, I lifted her legs and put my hands on her hips as I slowly lifted her off me, moving them back as I pulled her back down onto me. I moved faster in and out of her, feeling the weight of her. She kept moving her hips to meet me even though she was lying still.</p> <p>I kept kissing her, moving my tongue along her lips, her mouth, moving our hands all along her body. She moved her hands to my face as I caressed the side of her face, her neck, her breasts. I sucked her nipples between my lips, as I slid my right hand back to her breast. She pulled my hand between her thighs, and her hand was back at my mouth. I moved my hand up to her pubic mound, and her legs tightened against mine as she came.
