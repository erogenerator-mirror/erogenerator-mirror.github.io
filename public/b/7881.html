"And if he decides, it will cost him a gold ingrym for an evening of sex on top of the gold himself."</p> <p>"Is that true?"</p> <p>"Yes. That's my plan," the king said with a little laugh, "but if he doesn't, and I don't get to come, it will cost him more than two gold gold pieces. I just have to hope he will enjoy himself."</p> <p>The king nodded, and started making several more cards, he said when he was done. "I want to make some more choices," he said, "and one of mine will be for you, I believe it's your turn."</p> <p>"I'll do as you wish," the queen said smiling. "But only because it could hurt me."</p> <p>"I'll do anything to please you, yes," the king's wife said with a wink.</p> <p>"If I tell you to, you will do it; the next time you see him you'll want to see him." She then smiled when he said that when he knew her answer, which meant it would probably be more or less what had she said. "He's such a sweetheart, and if he likes something, well, we will."</p> <p>The queen nodded and reached out for something to bring up, then asked, "Shall we do the dares?"</p> <p>"Yes," the king replied, "I think our luck is changing. I think we should make these little decisions for us."</p> <p>"It's a good choice," the queen said, "I'm in love."</p> <p>"And I was hoping you would," the king said grinning, "but now he has a hard enough time with losing everything."</p> <p>"So, what do you think?" she asked.</p> <p>The king got up, got dressed, and went to leave. "I'll see you tomorrow night, then," he said in a stern voice, "and we'll come back for you."</p> <p>The queen sighed. "Do you really want to come?" she asked of the king.</p> <p>"More than anything," the king replied, "I think if I can do something nice for you, it will make me very happy; he just needs someone to look after him for once."</p> <p>"I think you can," she said.</p> <p>"I don't think so, either," the king said with a smug smile, "or if I can't, maybe you can."</p> <p>Harmadamus made three more decks and placed them back into the deck; now he began to work on the deck again. "Let's go," he said, "we'll finish this up tomorrow, and come back on Thursday."</p> <p>"I have an idea," he said with a grin. "Let's get naked and go down to the beach for our dinner."</p> <p>"I think it might be a wonderful idea," she said.</p> <p>"Let's," he said, "if we get naked, we'll have no choice but to come by."</p> <p>"Yes, yes," she said.</p> <p>They went back out to the deck, nude, and set the table where the people were. "I thought this place was a little fish-in-the-headland," said the king, "but it has been a very different life for me."</p> <p>"The life is so much better here," he replied. It's a very different life, but it's a wonderful one, too."</p> <p>They got a bottle of wine out of the cellar and went back to their place, "Let's have a quiet dinner," he said taking his wife's hand and leading her to the balcony.</p> <p>"Are you nervous?" asked the queen, with a nod.</p> <p>"Pretty damn, are we?" he said.</p> <p>He took some wine from the refrigerator and they took seats in the lounge chairs. He handed the bottle of wine to her, not saying a word to her; he was going to make them a drink; however, he let her take his hand and hold it, a move very unlike the king's and not something he would ever do. They drank their wine and discussed the changesâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
