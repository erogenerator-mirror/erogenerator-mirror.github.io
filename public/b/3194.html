I was wearing a short black, sheer top and a light blue, silk bikini that barely covered my nipples while leaving plenty of cleavage showing. My nipples weren't hard, but they were certainly hard, straining against the fabric of the swimsuit top. I slipped the top off and let it drop to my waist in a single motion, leaving me only in my bikini bottoms. Once again, my tits were barely contained. You could see them through the material, a nice contrast to the rest of my body. The top barely covered them, barely covering my areolas, leaving my nipples in full display, my breasts jiggling with each step. My pussy was shaved to show off my bikini, leaving the area completely bare. "I like it." I said with a wink.</p> <p>We had another glass of wine, and as we did, he took one last look at my body and said, "God I would have fucked you right there." This time, it was my turn to take a big gulp of wine before I could respond, but my mind was completely on the feeling when he said, "I just can't wait 'till the end of this." I think I was blushing. His stare lingered for a moment as my mind tried to process the idea. Then the moment came when I suddenly felt really horny...so turned on...and I knew that nothing else mattered.</p> <p>I was in a state. I wanted him to see what it felt like to have him fucking me. I wanted him to just take me right there. I wanted him to fuck me like I had been fucking other men at that very moment...and I wanted it all with him. I thought a little more about this feeling a moment later, and I suddenly was overcome with desire. He looked at me for a long moment, and I realized that I really wanted him. I wanted him to take me again and again and again and again until I thought I would lose control...until I felt that feeling of complete surrender.</p> <p>Before he moved, he turned toward me, still naked from the waist down, and said, "I don't want to come between that wonderful woman and you. I don't want to come between you and anyone else at this very moment."</p> <p>"No," I replied, "Let me go and you can look at me without feeling guilty. Let me go see if you can't please me and forget about anything else that happens tonight!"</p> <p>"Okay," he said, then quickly turned away from me. I couldn't believe my reaction or even how turned on I had become. My pussy was dripping with excitement as I watched as he returned to his bed. He walked straight into the bathroom, and then came right over to me. He sat down on the lid and lifted one of my nipples into his mouth, then began to suck it. It didn't take long for me to have a second go at my other one. He had one hand on my other breast while the other started rubbing my cunt through my bikini, feeling the moisture there, working in a circular motion, as he was sucking on both erect nipples at the same time.</p> <p>He then stood up, pulled my face toward him, and kissed me, hard, and I felt that same feeling in my mouth as before as I felt his tongue enter it. As our tongues battled, I felt his hand slip under my bikini, and then as the fabric of his swim suit slid across his crotch a soft gasp escaped my lips. I was so aroused that I could have screamed, but it was only that I felt that the intensity of his body with mine, and the look on his face as he slowly peeled the bikini down my body, watching for what was coming, was the absolute most erotic sight that I had ever seen. I felt the bikini slide completely down my ass, and then his lips kissing their way to my mound, licking it. I felt so wet I could hear the little squish as his tongue made contact with my pussy lips.</p> <p>He didn't put my bikini back on right away, instead he began to strip it, taking off his shirt, then his pants and shoes. It didn't take long for me to remove mine and his swim trunks. I stood there, naked, looking at him in his bathing suit, as he took in what I saw. His cock stood up proudly, proud and proud, making his entire body look a little larger than it probably was before he wore only a swimsuit. He had a great, healthy, large circumcised and very thick dick. As I stood there, watching him strip, I saw his cock getting even harder and thicker. "Oh shit," I thought to myself, "He's a natural. I haven't seen another dick like that since my husband was alive." I couldn't take it anymore. The vision was amazingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
