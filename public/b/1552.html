"We're all booked together for the next two weeks and my girlfriend is staying with us. She was just finishing up her second year and was going to have an affair with me. She told me that you were also. She's in town for a few days. We can arrange to meet at the club a few days later."</p> <p>- "Sounds good. I have a proposition for you.</p> <p>- "Let me ask you something, Chris. If you don't get comfortable with my idea, or I don't feel that I should, would you agree to go away with me? I've been in an amazing and varied relationship with two beautiful and sexy women.</p> <p>- "As long as it wouldn't be anything dangerous, I'd love to go. After all we've already done. How about you?"</p> <p>- "Oh? Well, I guess that's just a little strange. I've never thought of a club like a club before. That's one thing I definitely haven't. I'd be uncomfortable with that sort of stuff. It's something I've never done before."</p> <p>- "I have a proposition for you now."</p> <p>- "Oh, okay. Well it would be good if we could all go together tonight. Let me just get my purse and we can go."</p> <p>- "No it's okay, I'll go get my purse and I'll meet you in the limo. We don't want a repeat of last week," she said.</p> <p>- "I know. I told her I was going away to visit some friends and she said that she'd want to go to my hotel. She mentioned that she wants my place all evening. Would you like to come?"</p> <p>- "Okay. I guess I would," she said.</p> <p>- "Well I'm a little nervous about this," I said. "Is it okay if we stay here, you and me?"</p> <p>- "Of course. It's not illegal for you to be here. It's okay if you like. I guess a hotel isn't really a good idea."</p> <p>- "No, no. That's okay. I understand. It's a little strange, but not really bad. I've never done anything like that before."</p> <p>- "Well, we'll let the taxi driver handle it. It's really nothing special. He'll just keep us company while we're staying at our place."</p> <p>- "I can't do that."</p> <p>- "No, you can. It's just that I'm pretty nervous about this. If we go out, then it's not really a bad deal."</p> <p>- "Well, don't be afraid. Just give us a little time to get used to it. We'll be all right."</p> <p>So on Friday evening, Amanda and Jill went to my place, and I went to the limo. I took Amanda inside to get her bag and I followed Jill to the Limo. We all had a nice time chatting and drinking wine with each other. We were all feeling very relaxed and I had no reason to tell Amanda that I knew her boyfriend had already taken her up the butt. It was just a harmless fling between two men that I thought was really nice and fun. I had to admit that Jill and I never discussed how we all met.</p> <p>It just felt great to know that we had a couple of lovely girls out there for pleasure and no one was going to tell me a lame joke. The more I thought about it, the more I agreed with Amanda. But if it makes the time to take a drive, I guess we can take the lift.</p> <p>- "Jill, let's go," I said to her. "We all wanted to be honest."</p> <p>Jill laughed.</p> <p>- "Jill, this isn't the way. I just don't know how to tell you the story. But you're right, it sounded pretty interesting. We know that the man in the car is a real nice guy but I just don't know how to tell you that."</p> <p>We arrived at Jill's hotel around 4 o'clock. We were still early. We had planned to take Amanda to her room, but the limo had come with a lift and it had gotten quiet as we entered. We walked towards the elevator and took a cab to the top floor. The lift was only a few floors up and we didn't have a car there for awhile. The lift arrived in front of Amanda's door only after the lift stopped. I looked out and could see that we still had an extra floor so we waited about half an hour before the lift pulled up.</p> <p>When the lift door finally opened, I saw Jill and Amanda step out. They didn't bother to tell me where they were goingâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
