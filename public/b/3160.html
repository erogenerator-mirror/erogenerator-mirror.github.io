"I'm sure of it." His expression said it all.</p> <p>After a few minutes, he asked the bartender if he could have a drink. He took one and sat down next to me.</p> <p>I told him I was going home and then leaned over and gave him a small peck on the cheek. When we got up to leave, I felt that I had put a little on with my dress, too. I smiled at him when we were through with our drinks and he said he'd be glad to pay for it.</p> <p>As we walked home, I looked up as we reached the front door and saw my husband was staring at me.</p> <p>"That was quick." he told me, grinning.</p> <p>I laughed, "I can't believe how many times I'm thinking about what might happen tonight."</p> <p>He said that's just what he was thinking about now and I could see that I had done the same.</p> <p>I told him I was sure the anticipation was killing me, but I would never betray him. We hugged and left the pub as I saw him head back to his car. There was no mistaking that there was some excitement in his eye as he drove away. But for now, I was just happy to have his company.</p> <p>When we got home, we went straight to bed, but not before I told him that he had just made me cum twice that night.</p> <p>"You're the one that made me cum so hard," I told him in no uncertain terms.</p> <p>"You made me cum again," he said. "I want to do the same thing."</p> <p>This time, I told him that was all the fun I got. We quickly fell to sleep with us cuddled together under the covers. I awoke several hours later and found that I could not get out of bed fast enough. But that was okay. I finally had to make the run to my office.</p> <p>When I got there, I was just about as horny as I had been in a long time, but I needed to do my work for sure. I headed to the office a while later. As I approached my desk, I could see the look of joy on his face as he looked at his phone.</p> <p>"I've got to call someone to set something up," I told him. "Who's coming?"</p> <p>Suddenly, both of us heard the doorbell.</p> <p>"No, I didn't think that it would get this late," he said. "We couldn't sleep in a hotel."</p> <p>"I'm sure nobody will be expecting any of us to be working in front of them."</p> <p>"That's not true. There wouldn't be anyone else to tell if something was up."</p> <p>I smiled as I got behind my desk and dialed the number.</p> <p>It went immediately to voicemail. I knew that if I could simply go downstairs to his answering machine I would be able to get the story out of the room and could start the day off right. I did not want to put that risk on him in any way. He was so smart I was surprised that he was able to do that and also that I liked him after seeing how much.</p> <p>"Hello?" he asked after his voice mail message ended.</p> <p>"Steve, are you there already?" the voice on the other end of the phone asked.</p> <p>"Yes, I'm on your way, how are you?"</p> <p>"I'm great, what are you doing?"</p> <p>Again, I heard it going for just a second, but the tone was like any other and there was no doubt whatsoever in my mind that it was important.</p> <p>"We just wanted to say hello and thank you for calling," he responded.</p> <p>"Steve, as you know, I have to go out and sign the divorce papers now," I warned him. "If you want to go back to your old life, that is okay. I don't care how often I have to go out. It doesn't always work that way, but I wouldn't be happy if I had to leave right after I got back."</p> <p>There was no more convincing than that, but then I still had him.</p> <p>"Well, maybe I should see if I can help you," I told him. "I've been working all day on this."</p> <p>"Are you sure?" he asked.</p> <p>"Steve, are you mad at me for trying to get you divorced? Are you mad at me because I was trying to get you divorced? Do you know how much that hurt?"</p> <p>"I don't care about that. Are you sure that all you have to do is listen to meâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
