We have an office, but no one is really around. She was born and raised in the city, and has been a teacher in two different schools. She had her own place a few years ago, which I guess was nice, but is far and away my favorite. She has a really nice personality, and her hair is still a bit mussed and unkempt, but that soon fades as it's all gone. She always wears a loose-laced, long-sleeved t-shirt. Her figure is good, all the way down to her cute face. She's got the most exquisite legs that the guys drool over, too. They're long and taut on that roundness, and I think they are even longer and thicker in the backs. It's just like her ass. She's so gorgeous that a whole lot of guys who haven't got a chance notice her. She knows exactly what they're looking at: it all seems to go on the inside of their head. I just love her to the fullest. When she wears any clothing, it tends to flare out and bounce around her body. She's the sexiest girl in the whole world, and I do want to go out with her some day.</p> <p>"How did you manage to pull it off?" I asked her.</p> <p>"What do you mean? I haven't."</p> <p>"You were the one with you and Mr. and Mrs. Smith."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"Yeah, it looks like we did."</p> <p>"I can't imagine why anyone would be unhappy if you're unhappy with your life," I said with a grin.</p> <p>"Yeah, I guess that's true."</p> <p>"How is my day going?"</p> <p>"Oh, you know it already." She gave me a quick hug and a peck. "It's been a long day."</p> <p>"Well, it's a lot to handle there."</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>The morning came and went, no one at work. The office was closed. I made an appointment for lunch with the boss. He asked me to stay after work for lunch and have lunch at his house. He was a nice old guy, and I'd like him to take care of my life that way. He was a little paunchy, and a little stocky with a little pot belly because he took his work so very seriously. I was a little annoyed when I first saw him at the office, but it didn't seem like he was all that bothered. He didn't seem to even notice I was there.</p> <p>He was dressed in a suit and a tie. He was a little thinner than I like, and very well proportioned. There wasn't much in what he had on over weight, but over everything in there, it seemed, he was just as fit as you would ask for a doctor. He greeted me with a kiss on the cheek and said, "Welcome to my humble abode. You can have lunch. You might as well join me."</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>I wasn't hungry, but I thought maybe lunch might be right, something to do with something. I sat at the desk for several minutes, listening to Mr. Wilcox and some of the other people I worked with. He hadn't even noticed I was there, so I thought I could just make small talk and avoid the awkwardness all around. I decided for the sake of conversation that it would be a nice lunch, as it would give me a chance to keep my mind occupied, so I said "hello" and went back to filing. After fifteen minutes there, there was still no sign of the receptionist to my left.</p> <p>"Mr. Wilcox, hello. I'm Mary, but everyone calls me Mary, and I'm afraid we're all in agreement. Would you like a sandwich or something?"</p> <p>I just stared at him for a minute, then finally said, "Yes, why not. I'm starved."</p> <p>He looked at the back of his phone and a minute later came the same text back: "Come with me on back."</p> <p>We got into his house, and I made a decision to take off her shirt. I knew some women would lose that battle, but I felt that there really was no such thing as an easy way to go about it. I didn't really feel like I needed to make her sweat. I unbuttoned the shirt while I went to get some water. She looked so good from up near her shoulders, and there was almost nothing either of us could do to resist her. Then, there was only one thing that really was important, so I took advantage of any excuse I could get. I pulled down the top of her shirt and took a good look at her breastsâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
