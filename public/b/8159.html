He laughed, almost as deep as he felt.</p> <p>"Me too," I said, and we shared a quick gaze of mutual admiration before a slow, silent laugh rose from him and I looked away, my eyes going from him to the dark room, not wanting to blink. Before I had the chance, a deep, male chuckle had erupted from him too, and as he turned to leave, his arm tightened around the back of my neck, holding me close, and his lips were in an ever more passionate, yet teasing, kiss as we pulled away. I could feel the tension in him as we walked toward the door, and I knew he must truly want me to make a move. But he had left me plenty of time to think about it, and I could feel myself blushing furiously as I took his hand in mine, leading him back toward my car, the smile on my lips fading at the thought of what he had said.</p> <p>I had no more time to consider it before we reached my car, and I drove away from my house, my heart still racing. I felt like the world had gone completely dark, as if I could never quite come back down. At least until I heard him, my heart thudding in my ears.</p> <p>--------------------------------</p> <p>It was almost six o'clock by the time we got back to my house. I had a bottle of wine and a couple of glasses, and as I stood on the porch waiting for him to pick me up, his arms encircled me, holding me close, like a blanket, his lips whispering against my ear, telling me that he wanted to spend the whole weekend with me and we would spend the weekend together. As our mouths found each other again, he held me close and I could feel his warm breath on my face through the thin lips. He slipped his right hand under my shirt, and his thumb brushed against my nipple softly. He leaned his face in close to mine, and I could feel his hot breath against my neck, hear his lips move against mine, and feel my breathing quicken. He stepped back a little, and, with a deep sigh, he picked me up off the porch, holding me in his arms.</p> <p>"I was beginning to think that we'd never get to spend Sunday together," he said, and we both laughed. He put me on my back in the warm grass, and he lowered himself down to me. He was kissing me, my lips pressing up against his, and he lowered his own mouth onto mine. Our tongues quickly dueled around each other, as my arms ran themselves up and down his back, holding him close to me. He slid his tongue into my mouth, taking a moment to tease my bottom aching for his attention, and we traded our saliva back and forth as we kissed again and again. My hands ran up his back, feeling smooth, hard skin, and felt his skin break through mine, and he broke his kiss long enough, to wrap his arms around me again, just pulling me close to him.</p> <p>I felt his hand slide down to slide under my shorts, and he felt the soft curls of my bush beneath it, and, with a smile, he felt the wetness that was there. He lifted his head from me, holding his breath as he stared at me, and, as I watched him, I felt my hips thrust in answer to his hand on my pussy, and I could tell that he was very aroused by the movement of his fingers under my panties, his eyes on me in a whole new light. I felt his right leg press between mine, and I could feel how firm and full that lovely piece of meat in his shorts. He began kissing me again, this time a bit more gently, slowly. He could tell that I was getting more and more impatient as he kissed me, though I didn't care too much. He slid his other hand down to slide his fingers inside me, feeling the wetness there, and it was as if I wanted him to do whatever he wanted with me now, just let me do anything he wanted with me. The whole thing was a tease, but it was a fire in me to hear him saying my name like that, and to feel his tongue on my lips and inside my mouth. I could tell that he was still fully clothed, and I knew that he enjoyed my body, his body. And, like that, I felt the urge to join in so I took off my shirt, my bra, then my skirt, my shoes. I was standing there in my underwear, and he had my panties off in no time, and we were staring at each other over my panties, our mouths still locked together.</p> <p>"You really are beautiful, aren't you," I said, when he finally came up for air.</p> <p>"Yeah, you've got something on your beautifulâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
