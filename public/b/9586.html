I felt every stroke, his head moving all around inside me, touching places with his tongue that were never touched before. And I did too. I just lay there, with my eyes closed, my breath coming in short jerks, and he teased me with the very tip of his dick sliding up until it pressed at my little asshole. "I'm not going to stick my dick up inside of you, yet," he said finally. As he pushed a little harder inside me, he leaned forward a bit, placing his hands on my shoulders and pushing me forward so that both our heads were now hanging over the bed. I could feel his dick moving against me, as it rubbed against my back, and then up to my clit. It wasn't as big as Mike's, but it still felt pretty good to me.</p> <p>"You can keep your eyes closed, baby," I heard him say into my ear as he pulled my legs up and apart, his head resting comfortably on my hip. I opened my eyes, looking down.</p> <p>"That's it," he said and ran his tongue from my pussy. I couldn't believe what I was feeling; I felt completely vulnerable and vulnerable.</p> <p>With that, I felt a rush of warm oil drip down my body; it had the feeling of sliding down my spine.</p> <p>"I need more, right now," was all I could say before Mike got the bottle and started pouring it onto my back. I reached back and held on, feeling the oil sliding up and down from my lower back up until it was around my anus. I tried clenching my muscles, trying to block it, but after a minute and a half of rubbing, the massage ended there.</p> <p>I felt Mike's hands move off my back just as he had started. After a minute and a half of pushing inside me, he stopped. I looked down to see his dick, hanging away from my body, and I realized that it was too late to get up. It felt great. And I felt it move in my pussy. Mike looked back at me a bit, and then back at me with his cock up in my ass.</p> <p>I felt his hips press up a a tad, and I felt the warmth start to spread out along the inside of my ass, over my skin. This must have felt different, because his dick quickly slid out of my now sopping pussy, and I felt the warmth, then the feeling of something pushing into my ass as well. In spite of having just been fingered and fucked, I felt a slight burning sensation as the burn spread along my skin and spread through my whole body. I had no idea how many times I'd been fucked, but I knew that if I came, I wouldn't be feeling much pain, as my muscles were still too tight.</p> <p>Suddenly, I felt his hands stop pushing inside me, and as his cock slowly started to slide into my ass, I knew that he had just wiggled it in there. And his dick slowly slid itself into me. I knew what I needed to do. I didn't feel as bad as my ass feeling a few minutes ago, but even that realization made me feel slightly self-conscious, but I could feel my pussy, still slick with my juices and his oil, start to ache.</p> <p>It felt awesome. I felt like I could do this all day. Mike took that moment to pull back, only to quickly push forward again. I could feel his head touching my prostate in there with each push. I felt him pulling back, only to start pushing forward again. After a few minutes of this, I felt Mike's hips press firmly into me. As he pulled back and pushed forward, my legs fell back together, and my legs spread as he pushed himself forward once more.</p> <p>When he pulled out, we could see the base of his dick sticking out of the side of our mattress, and it seemed as though it was already almost all the way out. His shaft hung off to the side, looking somewhat surreal and erotic, like a beautiful piece of art.</p> <p>I looked down at our bodies and could see his dick moving back and forth in and out inside my ass. Mike started to slow his pace after a minute or so and pull back all the way out, not once, but twice. I had my eyes closed and my hands clasped on the front of him, and when his dick finally popped out of my ass, I felt the cool air brush up against the inside of my thighs. It felt cool, and my ass felt cool. This sensation was incredible. His cock was inside me so deep, it felt like I could feel myself up to my balls.</p> <p>I felt him move down, his cock falling out of my ass and then coming completely out. I felt it slip across my anusâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
