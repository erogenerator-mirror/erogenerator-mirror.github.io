"And we can chat, and maybe work."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>There's a knock on the door.</p> <p>Liam sets his briefcase down, and goes to answer it. The door opens, in search of Trisha. The redhead is dressed in the same clothes she'd worn the night Trisha left, and is carrying a tray of drinks in a hand carrying a basket of something else. Trisha, a bit less elegant in her dress, is not wearing any make-up, nor is the white cotton blouse she's wearing either. Her eyes are cast down, and she has the lips of a child, and her lips are pouting. She stands, and takes the tray. I wonder how her hair is going. I ask about her and her husband, and they exchange pleasantries. I wonder whether it was because of their friendship, or simply because of the wine. Trisha tells me that when they went for their honeymoon, Liam was not as attentive to their sex drive, and, although he was still interested in their relationship, he hadn't yet experienced a sexual encounter with Trisha. His desire was almost out of control at first, but finally he fell for Trisha when she asked how Liam wanted to act around her. Trisha, though, was more enthusiastic about joining in with their sex games. There were no worries at the hotel, just the obvious need.</p> <p>I hear her say, "Well, I guess I'm ready to move on. You'd better be. I can't believe it's Trisha I'm about to meet. She was like the first time I did her. It was wonderful."</p> <p>"It was your first time. It should be with Liam."</p> <p>Liam responds with a look of surprise. "What did he do?"</p> <p>Trisha explains to Liam her background, and their plans with the three of them. Liam starts laughing, and Trisha lets go of his hand. "Do you remember how I used that? Liam, I think Trisha was in there too."</p> <p>"Yeah, I remember."</p> <p>"When we met. There it just ... you don't know how good that feels. I mean, that doesn't really compare. It wasn't the same as last night. That was amazing. And there's no comparison." Trisha blushes a little.</p> <p>"How so, Trisha," I ask, "is that all that's between you and Liam?"</p> <p>She puts her hand on Liam's leg to emphasize the comparison. "Yes, I have no comparison whatsoever for Liam. It's you. He's the one that really gets me going, and doesn't hurt me. I've had it with just about all of us."</p> <p>I'm surprised that she's even trying to fit in.</p> <p>"I know, I know," she says. "It's a feeling that, well, maybe it's a little over with now."</p> <p>"Well, maybe it might be more."</p> <p>"Liam didn't hurt anyone," she answers. "A little."</p> <p>"You don't think Liam did?" I ask, "It's not that. He didn't hurt anyone. But you know that if he did, I think he deserved his punishment tonight. You know what I mean about that."</p> <p>Trisha's eyes light up, and she says, "That's what I thought too. I love it. I liked it when I was in the same boat as him."</p> <p>"He loved it," I add. Trisha looks me right in the eyes, then slowly crosses her legs, and says, "I really like that part of him."</p> <p>"You did too," I reply. "You were in for a good time."</p> <p>"He made me a good time. We've already done it before. I'll let's finish our drink, and he can return the tray."</p> <p>Liam walks over to Trisha and bends down and kisses her lips, then starts to undress her. She puts her arms around his shoulders, and kisses his neck while he does it. After he's naked, he looks over Trisha's body, and says, "If you feel like taking a walk in that park, I'll walk you home."</p> <p>"That's nice," Trisha says as she gets up on her crutches and follows Liam over. They start to walk in the park, and Trisha reaches out and pulls Liam's hands to sit on the bench near me. Her hands leave his, and she turns his hand, bringing it to her mouth and licking his palm, and saying, "Just taste me for one second." Liam just smiles and watches her, enjoying the show.</p> <p>"I am going toâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
