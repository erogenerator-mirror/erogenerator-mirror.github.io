My tone is playful, teasing me.</p> <p>His grin is a little mischievous, I can tell he wants me to. His words drive me insane.</p> <p>"Oh god yes," my lust is growing.</p> <p>He pulls out of me, kissing me deeply as he pulls off the condom, sliding inside me. Once again I'm soaked, his cock feels so incredible. He holds himself up in front of me, letting me feel how big he truly is. He's definitely one of my kind.</p> <p>He kisses me deeply, grinding into me. One hand reaches up and fumbles my cock, playing with my balls. I push him onto his back, kissing him as I start to drive myself hard and fast into him.

I can feel him throbbing inside me, and he's so wet now. I feel him as one final push sends every ridge and vein on his hard cock inside me, as I hold him in my hand.</p> <p>I hold him in, feeling my own climax in my hand. I'm still trying to maintain my composure. He's still hard inside me, and I can feel every vein of his hardness. He's still deep inside me. His breathing is still heavy, holding out for a moment. His hand slows down.</p> <p>"Stay there." I'm breathing hard, and he's still inside of me.
