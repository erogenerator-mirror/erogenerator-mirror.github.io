A lot had changed in the last few days. There were new things being brought to the fore in my life but all of it seemed old. I guess at this point I was just about ready to open my eyes. I heard a noise from the bathroom and I looked at the bathroom door. I opened the door half a foot and was greeted with the sight of the beautiful naked Asian female lying on the bed in all her glory and me. She slowly started to writhe against me while she held my dick in her hand. She looked up at me and then down.</p> <p>I took her in my arms and kissed her. "It's so beautiful," she said, and we kissed again. She rolled over onto all fours and presented her cute ass to me. She spread her legs out at a decent angle and I gently rubbed her sweet little butt hole. "Aaaaahhhh," she cooed, as I pushed a finger inside her. "That feels so nice," she added.</p> <p>I looked at her in the mirror as I fingered her. I pulled her cheeks apart while I pushed first one and then two finger in her lovely ass. "Ohhh," she cooed with delight. "You finger-fuck my ass, you naughty boy," she giggled. I continued fingering her and eventually I could take it no longer. I pulled my dick from her hot pussy and stood at the head of the bed, stroking my erection. I saw the look of surprise on her face and her eyes lit up, and I realized. I didn't know her first name, I was just guessing it was Julie. She reached out to me, putting my hand on her cheek.</p> <p>"That's my baby," she said. "I'm your girlfriend."</p> <p>"Do you love me?" I asked with amazement. "Do you love me?"</p> <p>"Yes. I love you, sweet brother," was her answer. It seemed to last forever, but I guess the excitement passed it out of my hands and onto her.</p> <p>"Honey," I said. "Are you ready to see what it's like to be a man and live a life to become a man?"</p> <p>She looked at me and nodded. She kissed me all over the side and then turned around and stood on the bed, holding out her arms with my cock in them. She looked over her shoulder as I put her down on all fours. As I put my dick in her pussy she closed her thighs over my waist. She wrapped her legs around me and began riding me. I pushed her onto the bed while my other hand was exploring her breasts. "Is this what being a woman feels like?" she asked as she bounced up and down on me. I was surprised I could even move while her pussy was doing something else. "I'm not sure," I answered.</p> <p>"No, it's true..." she said, and then her words died on my lips as I felt my cum shoot into her.</p> <p>When we came to a rest on the bed, she looked at me and then kissed me. "I've never felt more loved," she said as she pulled me tight to her. She held me like that for a while and then we embraced.</p> <p>"I thought it would be better to have someone we could talk to," she said with a devilish grin. "I like that."</p> <p>After the rest for the night she drove back to my house.</p> <p>"Wow!" she said when she stepped back, admiring her work up-skirt in the hall mirror. "That was some show!" she exclaimed, giving me a playful look.</p> <p>"Yeah, it was, too. You want me to let you do that again?"</p> <p>"No, I want...no! I don't want you to do anything but make love. And if you do, we can go from this evening together to tomorrow."</p> <p>"Oh, I want that too. I can show you next time I get a chance," I said. "What would you like to wear for a date tomorrow?"</p> <p>She grinned. "Honey, you could borrow panties?" she said. "They're mine."</p> <p>"Okay," I replied with a smile.</p> <p>She had taken her skirt off again and she had put on one of my shirts and a button-down. "Why don't I put that on tomorrow before we go out and you can take the shirt off?"</p> <p>"Okay," I said. "I'm not going out to the club with you wearing something like that." She smiled and stood up, giving me a peck. "I've got to get going. You've got to meet your girlfriend."</p> <p>"A girlfriend?" She giggled.
