I open the door and wave goodbye at him. We head to the pool, where I lay out my new swimsuit, a red baby blue one that goes just below my breasts and has a little scoop on the bottom so your breasts can sit out proudly and stay out. I know you won't need to wear one because you don't ever get a chance tonight. The kids are there, having a good time and they can all fuck me in about half an hour so I think I'm ready.</p> <p>I know that you're ready so I'm going over to your place. After you leave, I tell you that you can look at my new bathing suit here, if you like. And it's a bit daring. With a couple of small triangles holding up a pretty good-sized bathing shell, I've got my top off in three days, so any one of your friends will want a look. You look in a mirror and say that you like it, too. I smile, then pick up my bikini back to the house and tell you it's not too bad for dinner. My hair is up and I'm wearing a very little white thong bikini, and you can have the top but the bottom. I let you look for a minute before I leave the house again and go back into her house again. "I'll join you in a minute. You still wanna see my panties?" You nod your head so I walk back out to the patio.</p> <p>I sit and wait for several minutes when you walk back to the patio. You walk in to the patio. This time I hear the water just a little while later. I get up and look out at her window. I watch while she's changing. I get off by the patio and walk over to her and say hi. I see her in front of a small table that is covered with several towels. I come over to the table and she lays the towels down. "Would you like to take a swim?"</p> <p>"Sure," she responds.</p> <p>I tell her to take the side chair, which she agrees to. I step onto the patio and sit down at the table. The water is about three feet away and we are sitting in it just a few feet away. I spread my legs slightly and watch you watching as you get into the water. "You like it a little daring?"</p> <p>"Yeah," you laugh. "I like watching you swim. I also have very little to hide," you say, grinning.</p> <p>"What?" you ask.</p> <p>"Just staring in the mirror, thinking about how my bikini is going to look," I say.</p> <p>You giggle again and say that she looks great.</p> <p>"I think I'll be okay," you say. "It's a nice suit if a bit revealing, you know."</p> <p>"No, it doesn't look too hot," I say, nodding in your direction.</p> <p>"It looks just a little hot," I add. "I have to admit, my wife has pretty attractive body's."</p> <p>"I know," you say. "Maybe because, she's my sister."</p> <p>We both giggle. I feel a little uncomfortable saying that. You and I get up, wrap up our things, and head for your sister's house.</p> <p>As we walk out of the house, I see that you have a couple more towels and I ask you if you want me to cover your whole body again. You don't say a word, instead smiling at me. I take the towel as you open it and I step out of it.</p> <p>"I got some things to do in the house, I see." And you walk over to her. I can see your bikini bottoms in the reflection in the mirror, but there's no other bikini for you. "That's okay," you say. You turn around and pull off your top and tie, then lift your top into the air, exposing your body to the cold day outside.</p> <p>"Nice," I say.</p> <p>"Thanks," you say with a giggle.</p> <p>We both laugh, then walk into the house again.</p> <p>"Are you ready for a swim?"</p> <p>"Yes!"</p> <p>"I have a lot of towels on you," I say.</p> <p>"Really? Do you think it's safe?" you ask.</p> <p>"It's pretty cold," I say. "Just not as cold as it is in here"</p> <p>I begin to get undressed and you stop me. "No, you can't," I say. "If you're going to stand in the way, I have an iron and a bucket of ice in the back.
