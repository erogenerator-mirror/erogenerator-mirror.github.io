I let my hand slide up and down her leg. My thumb and finger reached for her panties. They slid off easily. I slipped them off her thighs and onto the floor and stood again. I looked down between us and let my fingers slide through her damp pussy.</p> <p>"Mmmmmm," she said again. "Do you want me in your bed?"</p> <p>"Well ..." I smiled, licking my lips. "It looks like we have unfinished business here."</p> <p>She smiled and walked up to our bed. I watched as she tossed the bra on the floor. She climbed on the bed and sat on it. I took in her body, legs spread wide while her hands held her boobs. She looked down at herself and smiled. Her breasts were smallish but the pink nipples contrasted nicely with the creamy whiteness of her skin. She ran her free hand over her body, running her hands down her back to her ass and back up over her breasts. Her head tilted back and she closed her eyes.</p> <p>My cock was harder than the last time and stood at attention through the thin fabric of my slacks. It was standing tall and proud, hard and ready to be used. I stood up on end again and looked down at her, my right hand still holding on to the bed.</p> <p>"I want you in me." I said, smiling and standing. There was a small smile on my face. My cock was throbbing and pushing out at me, pushing the front of my slacks out. I moved my body down to her and lifted her legs. I hooked them at the inside of her knees and held her feet. My hands slid up her legs and onto her thighs. I pushed her legs apart and slid my body up against hers, rubbing my cock through her wet pussy, back and forth against it.</p> <p>"Do you want me to fuck you like ... like ... I did?" I teased, still rubbing my finger across her lips. Her breath was coming faster, more urgently and her eyes were half closed.</p> <p>"God, yes!" she moaned. "I want your cock in me! Fuck me, Jack!"</p> <p>I smiled and slid my cock against her. Her legs parted more and her eyes fluttered open. She was leaning against the headboard her pussy on fire as my hips bumped against it.</p> <p>"Yes, Jack, slide in to me!" she moaned, reaching down to hold onto the bed. "God, you feel so good inside me!" She let her hand drop to her clit and rubbed it. She watched my eyes on her pussy as I moved my body closer to hers and pushed my cock into her.</p> <p>"Fuck her!" I said once again, my hand in her hair, pulling her toward me. I watched her eyes again as she looked back at me, her tongue licking her lips, her hand rubbing faster against her clit. I pulled my body toward her and put my head right at her lips. I kissed her, holding myself there, pushing my tongue between her lips and into the side of her mouth. As her arms went around my back I pulled my hips away and slid out of her. Her face broke the kiss and she stared at me wide eyed, her eyes rolling back.</p> <p>"No!" I said, surprised, then smiled. I reached down and took hold of the belt on her side of the bed. Her eyes went wide as I took hold of the buckle, opening it as her grip grew stronger. I reached down and pulled her up, pulling her on her feet and we went over to the bed. I watched in amazement as she got her legs off the bed. She swung her hips to sit on the edge and I slid my body down into hers. Her hands went to mine and we wrapped around each other. I placed one hand on her tits, the other on her upper thigh. Our mouths locked on each other's, our lips pressed against each other. She pulled her lips from mine and let her right leg drop. I pulled her off the bed toward me and she wrapped her arms around my neck. We broke the kiss and she put her legs down and leaned back against the headboard, her arms stretched out out out to each side of me. She held onto one arm and my hand.</p> <p>"Kiss me." she said as she pulled her lips away from mine. I wrapped my arms around her thighs and my mouth came back to take in hers, kissing her deeply. I held her thighs wide with my hands and slid my tongue over her lips, her neck and breasts. I moved back up her body until my mouth was right in line with her ear.</p> <p>"I need to make you cum, Jack." She said, moving against me.</p> <p>"Oh, yes."</p> <p>My arms encircled her and pulled her toward me. Her arms went aroundâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
