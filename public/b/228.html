My erection felt like a steel bar and she knew it. She bent over and licked the head. She was going to suck it in, and if it stayed hard, she would. "You want me to clean it for you?"</p> <p>I grabbed her hair and ran my fingers through it. "Yes. Right there. You can do that."</p> <p>The next question was "where?"</p> <p>"Inside." I gave her another long breath. I didn't care that I wanted to feel her mouth on me. I didn't care that she had never sucked on my cock before, as long as she could. "Here." I said. She opened her mouth and I ran my thumb over her lips as I slipped it between them. I was wet, my tongue was shiny. She moved faster as she sucked. "Suck it, honey," I said, reaching for my cock. This time, I didn't make her wait.</p> <p>"Hmmm!" she moaned at me. I slipped my hand back into her mouth. "That's it. Yes, baby. That's it. Oh, god! So warm and smooth." I pressed it against her face briefly, then took it back again, sliding my fingers through her hair as I went.</p> <p>"Mmh!" she answered when I did. "It's nice," she said. And still, I pushed it to her lips. "Suck it, honey," I said softly. I slid it to her lips again and pushed it into her mouth, feeling the pressure as it slid against her tongue. She opened her mouth and took it inside. It was warm, and I was aroused beyond my control. I pulled my hand out of her hair and slipped it into hers.</p> <p>"Do you want me to suck your cock?" I asked in her ear.</p> <p>"Yes," she moaned. She knew what I wanted. She was just as excited as I was, and she would be happy to do it whenever we wanted it. I pulled her off my lap. "Do you want to fuck me, honey?" I asked again, this time letting go of her hair. We looked at each other.</p> <p>"Yes," she said.</p> <p>I picked her up in my arms. She wrapped herself around me and I slid her on me. I kissed her again. It was a warm, soft kiss. "So hot," she said. She was already wet, as if I hadn't been in her before. I touched her again, this time letting my hard cock slide against her thigh. "Yes!" she said, kissing me again. "Yes, yes!" I pushed it into her and she grunted as it slid into her. I pulled it out slowly and rubbed the head around her clit, then pushed it in a little more. "Oh!" she cried, then fell into me. I felt her arms come around my back, and her breasts press against me. There wasn't one minute that went by in my life that I didn't feel like a woman and she came in it. "I'm cumming," she said. That was too much. I slid it all of myself into her and she squirmed beneath me. Her back arched as I did. We had no space for it. We were on the floor, on top of boxes, and we were both coming and coming. We stayed pressed together. No matter where we were going, she didn't get the whole thing and I didn't. She was so happy, that she was just as happy as I was. I had no idea what had happened, but it was the hottest moment of my life, and I think I had it in spades. She was still pressed between me and the boxes, and I was on top of her. Our legs were around each other and we were kissing. This happened several times, with her still cumming every time we came. It was the closest thing that could be said. I was hard and she was wet. It was an amazing experience not knowing what was going on, but knowing where it was going to lead.</p> <p>I pulled away from her, then picked her up in my arms, so that she didn't drop me completely down. Her whole body fit into my arms, with mine wrapped around her.</p> <p>"You're still hard," she said softly. I could see that she was proud of it.</p> <p>"I know. I wasn't real hard," I said. I was already feeling a little better. "But it felt great to feel you back," I said. "I don't regret it."</p> <p>"I'm glad," she said, pulling her head back and looking into my eyes. "I didn't get to do that before," she said. It wasn't a questionâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
