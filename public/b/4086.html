I don't have time, honey." He held her head in his hands as he leaned in until their noses touched. When he kissed her, his tongue explored her mouth. His kisses were passionate, probing, biting, all the while letting his hands roam up her sides, under her breasts and across the top of her breast, and back to gently squeeze the flesh. She moaned again, this time in protest as to stop the tingling that was building. "No, it's just. . .it's just that . . ."</p> <p>"You know if I kiss you, it won't hurt."</p> <p>"It's . . I don't know. . .I could . . you know."</p> <p>"And it won't hurt."</p> <p>"So just stop trying and let me make love to you," she said, her voice rising with the thought and the desire.</p> <p>"It's alright, honey," he said. "It's alright, this isn't right."</p> <p>She nodded but didn't take advantage of what he was trying to do. Her lips opened and he took her in, holding her tight against his body as she responded in kind. He felt his cock throbbing in her and realized she was wet with her own arousal and it wasn't his. He was glad he came once but she had no idea what it felt like for him. He reached around with his hand and cupped her ass in his hand, squeezing it until it seemed to push back at him, wanting him to caress her all the way from her ass to her breasts, but no touch was required. She had no idea what he was doing when he did that. She didn't notice her hands were cupping his face so she could take him down to her. He didn't want to feel any pressure, at least not her own fingers on him, so he allowed them to rest on the cheeks of her ass. He didn't mind the feeling of her skin under his hand or her breasts against his arm, he loved the feel of her body pressed against his own and the heat of her body. He did have a tendency towards feeling close to those of a woman when they made love.</p> <p>"I'm sorry." Her voice was soft, but urgent. "I'm so sorry,"</p> <p>"Don't. . .don't think that. . .don't hate me. . .don't hate me."</p> <p>He lifted her head to look in her eyes. She tried to look away but she couldn't. He wanted this, couldn't stop himself, didn't have a choice. He knew that it needed to end, to be done and she would never say or even move on in her own thoughts, it was all he had. But he also needed to feel as close to her as he could be.</p> <p>He pulled back and leaned forward until she stopped him. Then he leaned back until their lips touched again. For several minutes, he held her against him as they both let their lips trail their way down her neck, from her breasts, across her stomach, to her pussy. He felt the wetness between his fingers that she was not sure of, but didn't care. She moved against him as much as he was, trying to get as much contact as she could. He was not sure she had ever been so hard.</p> <p>After a few minutes, the feeling grew and became more intense. Her thighs began to tremble, her hands clutched at the backs of his and she could feel that he was moving back against the counter with her.</p> <p>"This isn't right," she hissed.</p> <p>"No." He kissed her again, this time pushing his tongue between her lips and into her mouth. A long time passed and then she was at the precipice. He could feel that he held it back, just enough to keep the feeling from slipping away. He was feeling something special, something that had to be with her all of the time, something that they would have all sorts of new things to make them even. He would teach them.</p> <p>But this time, she was not ready for her own excitement. He pulled her back into him with a hand on her back and pushed himself deeper into her. But she moved. She did not want him to stop. She felt herself growing inside, pressing against him, wanting more, and when he held himself still with his hips, her hands moved from his shoulders to under his arms. So they stayed as they were until she could feel him getting even harder and knew he was going to fill her.</p> <p>He pulled her body back against his and she was lifted against him, feeling the hardness against her stomach, and she opened herself and felt him fill her. A long, slow motion she could imagine him doing, as if he was taking her in.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she moanedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
