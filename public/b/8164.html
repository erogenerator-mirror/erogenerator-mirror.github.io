Fuck.”</p> <p>I continued to pump my cock as I watched her ass wiggle and flex as she began to ride him. Her asshole was dripping wet with juice as it glistened with each motion of our hips. Her body shuddered and shook as she moaned and screamed. I thought I was going to cum before I felt my balls begin to tingle with the sensation.</p> <p>“Cum, Baby.” She ordered as she slammed her hips back against his cock.</p> <p>The first wave hit hard, making her cry out with each wave.</p> <p>“Fuck!” she screamed, pulling her ass apart as wave after wave of my cum shot from me.</p> <p>I felt the cum travel from my balls all the way from head to ass.

Mom sighed.</p> <p>We both laughed.</p> <p>“We’ll be back by noon." I sighed.</p> <p>When I pulled myself from her, we cleaned up and put on our clothes. Mom and I kissed and we went back to the boat to get ready for the next day. On the way, we kissed. Mom kissed my forehead, cheek, and lip before she said “See you in the morning, sweetheart.”</p> <p>I gave her a quick kiss on the lips and walked into the room, dressed in nothing but a pair of jeans that I knew would not do anything to hide my hard on—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
