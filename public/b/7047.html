Her knees were shaking and she couldn't stand the thought of leaving her husband so exposed to the world. 'Sure... I... have lots of time.'</p> <p>'But if you leave now I'll catch what I'm doing.'</p> <p>Jenny's smile was like a smile on a plumb again. 'Then I don't know how I'll be able to finish.'</p> <p>Jenny slowly turned around before walking back up the street. 'Do your worst,' she laughed. 'Then you'll never have time to enjoy this,' she laughed.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Jenny's stomach churned as she looked at her phone resting in the pocket of her jeans. The sound of the phone ringing had worried her again, but she had to answer it and hope that it would be something to take back into her mind where it had come from. With her heart thudding in her chest, the ringing became harder and faster until she felt herself flushing so that she felt even more vulnerable. Her heart was racing in her chest as she looked at the screen. It was the man that had given her so much pleasure just a few hours ago.</p> <p>'Hello...?' Jenny asked as the man's name registered on her mind.</p> <p>'Hi sweetheart,' the voice said on the first ring. 'How are you?'</p> <p>Jenny felt a sudden flush of embarrassment as she pressed her fingers to her lips. 'Well,' the voice started. 'I am really very sorry and I would like to apologise again once again. Your call had made me so horny but I also wanted to hear from you. Would you call again...'</p> <p>'Of course, of course," Jenny said without missing a beat. 'Is everything ok?'</p> <p>'Yes, of course,' the voice said again.</p> <p>"Hello...?' Jenny continued. 'Are you feeling alright?'</p> <p>'Yes... a little,' the voice replied. "I can't say more, but I'm glad to hear from you again. I've missed your voice."</p> <p>Jenny listened for a while as she composed her thoughts. With her phone in her hand she started to type her reply, but stopped with a start when her head sank into her hands. She shook it once again and smiled a bit nervously. 'Yes... I'm happy to hear from you again. I miss having you in my thoughts... a little.'</p> <p>'Good... that's great,' the voice was so soft that it almost sounded like a whisper. 'Thank you... but I shouldn't be so nervous... not just for you. I've just been thinking about you all day... about last night. I feel a little more confident now that it's been some time and I was really really looking forward to coming to you.'</p> <p>Jenny smiled a bit more sadly. 'I missed hearing your voice too,' she said before pressing on. 'Would you like to come over and have dinner with me?'</p> <p>There was the pause as Jenny considered whether to reply to her, but her reply was quicker. It was the first one she had gotten from her husband, and even as she waited for the other end to come, it was more of the same. Jenny felt a flush of embarrassment at having used the same name when the man from the phone just rang her number a few days ago – after being busy on the phone and having never even talked to him in person. She had also always had a rather shy sex drive, but it hadn't seemed that it could be helped. She hadn't had a woman in nearly two months and had been disappointed to not even meet this lovely man.</p> <p>Jenny didn't know quite who to think was the most amazing man that had just called her; it had been the most wonderful experience of her life. 'I'm really sorry... no... I'm not sure where to start' she finally decided. 'Do you live around here?'</p> <p>'I'm just on my way. I think I'll be fine here. Can you get me something to eat?"</p> <p>Jenny felt her jaw drop. The sudden silence seemed to almost throw her off. "I think so..."</p> <p>"Please come on over to my place," the voice again said.</p> <p>Jenny's heart sank as her mind wandered back to what had happened earlier in the day. 'Of course... that'd be great. Thank you for inviting me over...'</p> <p>With that final statement there was something else that Jenny didn't quite grasp. 'Of course it isn't... it's so... so wrong. It's just... I feel so... so... horny. Please don't be angry.'</p> <p>"Well come on... ' the voice replied once again. 'You don't have to say this, but I couldn't bear—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
