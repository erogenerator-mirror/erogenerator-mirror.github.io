"Because I trust you. Or was the answer to everything you said? I want it to remain that way, regardless of what we do..."</p> <p>He laughed, "You do know how that's supposed to be?"</p> <p>"As a friend," she answered before she wrapped her arm around him and held him tight. "This is going to be nice," she said quietly, "and for some reason... I just can't help but wonder if this is even what I need anymore."</p> <p>"Yeah," he nodded, and the conversation suddenly turned intimate. This was his secret. He wanted her to be vulnerable as he had been. He wanted her to be vulnerable, to be the one he held in his arms. He had waited for her to reveal how much he valued and admired her. Now it was time to give her one.</p> <p>"I'm not ready to just have sex with you," he admitted. "I didn't expect to get that opportunity. I don't think it's fair to assume you need to experience it as a woman without being able to come home before you do."</p> <p>She kissed his neck as her hand stroked his hard chest. "We're both going to have so many interesting experiences together, I don't think I can be any happier," she sighed sadly. "I'm not ready to just have sex... because some aspect of what that means is what it means in a relationship, not as a means to release that tension in between two partners."</p> <p>"Well, we'll find out soon enough," he smiled, and she was lost in his eyes. He stroked her hair, and whispered, "For now, I think we should continue seeing each other in a more open way."</p> <p>She felt a rush of happiness when she heard his simple but positive response to their relationship change.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>It was another week before they would go to see the museum again, and then they would spend that night in a bar of passion.</p> <p>She had known how it felt to be a woman again, in a new and positive environment, a time when all around her felt the same. It was all new to her as a woman, not just from a physical or emotional point of view. And in her new context, their love making never left her unsatisfied.</p> <p>She remembered how much she loved him; how much he took care of her physically and psychologically. And even if he wasn't in a position to comfort her emotionally at the same time as her desire to surrender herself fully was becoming a fantasy. There was nothing on earth she wouldn't let him do to her. He was her lifeline whenever she needed him. He could give her everything she wanted, no matter how much she might deny their sexual connection even if she was desperate to.</p> <p>She knew what she wanted and needed from him, and even those she couldn't seem to give.</p> <p>And yet in every way, she was his.</p> <p>He had not rejected her as a woman. He had not rebuffed her rejection as his wife. He had allowed her to give in to herself at last upon their parting. And now he held her and told her what to expect. It was as if he was going to tell her she was the world to him or something else entirely, in case there wasn't any way to reach that stage. She felt as if she needed it; to feel that it had been all around them all her life and she couldn't live without him.</p> <p>He felt the same as she did.</p> <p>She was so vulnerable. Her vulnerability left her feeling so vulnerable. Like she was in a cage, in an old movie where her fears disappeared and she was trapped and then she couldn't escape.</p> <p>The thought of being trapped in here and there as a woman, without him around terrified her. But she could live in the outside of it, in a place where all the outside world could view her and accept her. In a place where she didn't have to worry about his rejection, he could be there.</p> <p>She leaned up against him, feeling his heat, his desire as she hugged him tighter.</p> <p>She felt it in herself and in him.</p> <p>Her mind raced. The intensity was just as she remembered. She was being held in her arms by a stranger. She had no clue he was there, but his presence and his presence were in her soul and she loved them both.</p> <p>"This is..." she said aloud, "...this is like all the rest of it?"</p> <p>He had seen her in a mirror and he could not have imagined her expression. He could have seen all the lights in her body; there was this sense of balance in that area.
