I walked back to the bar. I saw some guys looking around and waved at them. Some got up as I came close.</p> <p>I stood near the bar with a small drink and looked at the guys. They were looking at me, mostly around me. I saw the looks of appreciation and the desire in their faces, they would stare as long as they had not wanted me. I did not mean it.</p> <p>I waved and smiled at the three guys, "Hi guys" I said. They looked toward my boobs. The guy from the club, the one watching me was coming over. I saw him come over. I turned back to the bar and waited for him to get himself another round.</p> <p>As I looked around, the guys were all looking at me now. The one watching me was walking toward me, he said to me "You have the prettiest set of tits there ever seen, I could tell. They have been hanging all night; I don't give a fuck, they want attention."</p> <p>When he was almost by me I turned to face him and he said "Now I know why I don't do that." He pulled down the front of my shirt, my tits came into sight, he moved his face near to mine and as our lips met I could feel his breath on my face, I put my arms around his neck and pressed my lips against his. Our tongues did a dance, his kisses were light and gentle. His hands moved over my tits, he ran his fingers over my nipples which they had grown hard in anticipation of his attention, I felt them poking through my shirt. He pulled my shirt upwards slowly as he did I unbuttoned his shirt. When I had it open to his shoulders my palms made contact with his nipples.</p> <p>When I had it opened I could feel his heat. He seemed to be fully erect under his pajama shirt. I unbuttoned and unzipped his pajama pants and they opened showing the thick dark black hair on his crotch. I pulled down his pajama pants and told him to lay down on the lounge chair. I walked back to the bar.</p> <p>I turned and saw the man I had been talking with earlier, he looked as if he had seen me walking away.</p> <p>"Well hello there." His voice came from the bar, "I'm Brian, pleased to meet you."</p> <p>Looking at me, his hand reached out and took mine.</p> <p>"It's nice to meet you too." I said</p> <p>I looked at my boobs bouncing as he took my hand. We walked across the bar and sat in Brian's small easy chair. He put his arm around me. I turned to look at him, our eyes met, he lowered his face to mine and our lips met. I felt his tongue slide over my lips, I opened my mouth to respond. I felt his hand move to my lap, gently stroke my panties under my skirt, I moaned when his finger moved over my wet clit, pressing softly against its head.</p> <p>We continued our kisses, I could feel his hard cock between my legs, under the cover of his PJs, he was growing hard. I moved my pelvis up to meet him. Then he pulled down my panties and touched my hairy cunt under my skirt, I gasped when he touched my cunt lips with his finger, inserting first one, then another, then another, it felt so good.</p> <p>He pulled his fingers out of me and kissed my mouth again, we began moving together, I was so horny; he was so hard. Suddenly my mouth was open and we were kissing again, our tongue intertwined around one another. I pulled up from his mouth and we stood, just standing there enjoying the moment. "I want you Brian" I told him, "I want to suck your cock."</p> <p>I pulled my panties to the floor, he got down to my knees. I spread my legs apart as he pulled off his pajama pants, he had the small hard cock, it looked to me like a nice cock. I was so wet, I was so tempted to suck on it, but I knew better.</p> <p>I took it into my mouth and closed my eyes and looked at it. It seemed like it was the center of my universe, I thought all of this was my universe. I moved it in and out of my mouth, I was moaning and breathing hard.</p> <p>I moved him a little closer, he got up, his cock was in my face. I opened my mouth and let it slide into it. It felt so different, I liked it. His cock began moving, then he pulled back, it was hard and long, it looked even bigger than it looked, I held it, wanting it in me more.
