If you don't stop me, and if you don't stop being gentle you'll be okay." I leaned over and kissed her.</p> <p>"Mmmmm." I felt her hands on my butt now, and she was pulling me into her. I had no idea how long it would go on, but it felt like my life had just changed forever.</p> <p>She said "Oh, God, you're so long!" and she wrapped her arm around my neck and pulled me tight against her. I was surprised by how much of my naked body was pressed against her, but I kept trying to pull away.</p> <p>"Just relax." She whispered, and kissed me again.</p> <p>Slowly we both started to breath better, and she was stroking my cheeks. After a few minutes I pulled my cock out with a soft pop. She was surprised, but smiled.</p> <p>"Is there something wrong with me?" she asked.</p> <p>"No," I said, "my cock is so huge." I was worried she might be afraid of this huge thing but she was so soft and her hands felt so big and it was so very erotic, and she stroked me with a gentle but strong grip. It felt wonderful.</p> <p>"I've always thought that." I couldn't believe that. She looked at me with what I took to be love. I think about it often, and she looked at me with a little smile.</p> <p>"And I really thought that when I first saw you when I pulled all this out I would be with you forever. Now I see, I really do love you." She kissed the tip of my cock, which felt even softer at the same time. I knew it had the feeling of being in somebody else, whether or not it really was anyone else, but I knew we couldn't be alone tonight.</p> <p>"I don't know what I can do to go back to the hotel again." She paused again. "I guess I have a problem with what that's all about."</p> <p>"What doesn't?" I said, "And what's that?"</p> <p>"I didn't like what happened this weekend, and that's what's wrong with it. I want to have sex again but I'm afraid I just don't...can't."</p> <p>"Sure you can. But let's get a shower first, and then you can tell me what's wrong."</p> <p>I kissed her and went to the bathroom, leaving a note on the door, and then I closed the door and turned on the shower. I was glad I had cleaned up before she came out of the bedroom, and I knew that it wouldn't get much wetter than it had been earlier. When I got in the bathroom, I stepped under the warm water and let the water hit my shoulders and wash away the sweat and grime from my body. It felt good.</p> <p>I got in the hot shower, took off all the soap, dried my hair, and I started to make up for what had happened that weekend. I shaved my chest, then got some hair on my arms, legs, and legs as well, and then I shaved around my dick. After my shower I put on a robe and went in the bedroom to put on a robe. The nightie I pulled on felt good against my naked body. "Goodnight mom," I mumbled. In just a second I heard soft music. "Good night," I replied. So did mom. I went back into the bedroom to find mom lying on her side on the bed.</p> <p>"Good night." I said, moving over to me and taking her in my arms with the robe she wore around her.</p> <p>"Good night, honey." She said as I lay down next to her and gently held her. "Did ...did you sleep better?" She didn't seem surprised at my question.</p> <p>"Not really. How was your weekend?" I asked. I was beginning to worry about the way mom had acted with me the previous weekend.</p> <p>"Just a little strange. Everything was just a little tense."</p> <p>"Just like the first time you said I had to be in school again, not just at lunch or at work."</p> <p>"Yes. And it was just a little strange. But I think I think we managed to work it out. When you say you need to go home for Christmas break, I guess I'm about to. I think I'll go for it on the way home. And we'll have the entire holiday weekend to ourselves."</p> <p>"I love you."</p> <p>"I love you too, sweetheart."</p> <p>"You know, that's a good thing." She kissed my lips. "I'm still worried. I'm just thinking that...about when . . . I have this feeling in me again." She smiled then.
