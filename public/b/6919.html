He opened the glove compartment and pulled out another cigarette as he walked around the truck.</p> <p>"Want one?"</p> <p>"Thanks."</p> <p>He leaned over to smoke his cigarette as he turned to the passenger side mirror, looking down and in through the windshield. He wasn't prepared for what he saw when he saw, but the look on his face convinced him that it wasn't a bad thing. He didn't care that, with the truck in the shop, people were looking at him. He looked at his chest, which didn't hide much as he'd expected, and wondered why he'd not wanted me to get into the truck sooner.</p> <p>He looked over his shoulder at the people in the shop. He wondered if one of them, the boy over there, could handle himself. Maybe as well, he thought to himself. He liked that thought, of being with me because I felt like a man and not just because I was your man. That was what he'd needed to be a man to be good at. So what if he was not an equal, the boy, or the man in front of him, could control himself and enjoy the things that his body told him he deserved for being the man that he was? But what if the boy could only be the only one in the shop, not the only one, and that made all the difference in the world in a few minutes.</p> <p>He considered telling him that, then wondered if the traffic on the way through the gates would be too bad. "I don't think so," he said to the driver before closing the tailgate. His thought to turn around and look at the man in the car made him smile. It would do so well to make a joke. He decided for that moment to make it a joke, when a truck horn sounded behind him.</p> <p>"What?" he asked as a middle-aged couple asked how much they wanted. As the man's eyes got wider, he wondered if this one was a woman or a man, he thought as the woman's eyes got wider. Why in the hell would the man even notice, he wondered? He figured he'd see if he took all of his money so that his car would be okay. "So they're asking prices in a city where they have the finest drivers." He figured it wouldn't take much to know them. "I was hoping that something like this might work out," he laughed with his mouth, "and a girl could do with some company. They're asking prices that just about anybody can afford."</p> <p>He smiled in agreement as he turned onto a dirt road. He hadn't taken all of his funds from either of his escorts and that he had used from the limo's loaners the most. He had made good money with that and the money was still there. "I suppose you could charge it to your cell phone, if we go there."</p> <p>"I don't think so." The man smiled and looked at the woman in the window. "I mean, no, they're asking a lot of money."</p> <p>"Well I think we can work something out," he replied with confidence as he watched the man get out of the truck and walk around to the side. "I think they'll let us in a little faster through the gates and then we can get through."</p> <p>"Really?"</p> <p>"The driver's license number isn't what they have in the limo, but I'll bet they're still talking to the driver."</p> <p>"You have a driver?!" the woman asked.</p> <p>"Yeah, a guy?"</p> <p>"Yeah, I mean, I'd probably have to call him and let him know."</p> <p>"So how do we pay the money?"</p> <p>"We get a taxi out to the limo and the driver buys the driver," the man responded, "if he was still paying for the fare."</p> <p>"No, we're right behind you."</p> <p>"So what, here we are," the woman said as she held her thumb out in front of her nose, "on these beautiful, warm days you don't mind to drive, did you?"</p> <p>Gianna smiled. "No, I just thought that you might like to see the city I live in."</p> <p>"That's fine then," he replied as he watched the road sway between the houses and turn, "and the road would get a lot smoother if it were just another one."</p> <p>"Yeah, that'd be nice," the woman said, as he walked onto the dirt road and pulled into a driveway beside a gate where some people had set up. "We'll just have to leave a little cash."</p> <p>"I'll take the car," the man said as he sat the truck down and looked at the man.
