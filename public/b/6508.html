He had a grip on the backs of my thighs and as he slid his cock deeper into me I felt his cock throb with each stroke and it felt so hot. I could not believe how he had so completely overwhelmed me.</p> <p>"I hope you have one extra hole now," he spoke in a deep and very sexy voice.</p> <p>I felt him slowly withdraw his head and I felt as if I were going to go all the way home. I was completely wet inside and I felt myself being stretched around his throbbing cock as he slowly slid himself out. It looked so erotic and I moaned at the sensation of being finally completely full up.</p> <p>"Oh my," was all I could say.</p> <p>I felt as if I was going to explode and I was about ready to tell him to stop but just once more he had me back bent over the table and I felt him drive his cock deep inside me with a moan. I didn't know what it meant or what it meant for him but I don't know. I just knew that he had his whole length now deep inside me and he started pounding me in front of everyone at the bar but I couldn't hold back very long and when I began to cum I felt him explode deep inside me causing a ripple of pleasure to travel from my toes up my body which I didn't realise until I felt his cock twitch and then empty itself inside me. "Wow" was all I could say as I collapsed on the table on top of it.</p> <p>He was still in as deep as he had been and I started to pull his cock out but he stopped me by grabbing my hips and turning me so my head was to the side and he was looking at me and was smiling broadly.</p> <p>"Wow," was all I managed to get out.</p> <p>The other two men at the table had all just sat with mouths agape and I had tears running down my face. It was quite a sight.</p> <p>"That was fantastic" said one of the men.</p> <p>"That's the point," I was still sobbing and he just gave me another kiss on the cheek.</p> <p>"I couldn't be happier" he said to me as he held me in his arms. He moved me round to face him and he began to kiss me again. I kissed him back and we both knew where we were as we kissed.</p> <p>"Thank you so much for tonight," I managed to say as he kissed my cheek and I moved back out of his arms and he took me by the hand and we walked off. There were about a dozen more people there at the bar by now but I didn't care.</p> <p>At home that was a huge relief and I fell asleep in his arms almost as soon as I had woken up. I felt exhausted but I was so very happy that I was glad that I'd already had a good orgasm last night.</p> <p>I found a place down at one of the pools in our flat town with just the two of us sharing the bed. It was a very sensuous and relaxing feeling but I did feel a little sore and was a little apprehensive about being in bed with the man of the moment.</p> <p>Once we had fallen asleep, he made me lay down across his lap. It felt very strange but not unpleasant I decided. It was one of those first few moments where I actually felt as though I were one of those sexy bitches who got all the hot guys and I got the ones who just wanted to get off.</p> <p>When we woke up it felt as though the sun had set and so I sat up and looked at all the bodies as I walked and I could see that he was enjoying himself immensely. My pussy was dripping wet and I made myself cum just watching.</p> <p>"I know if you do that again that I may get carried away." I joked and we both laughed at my mischievousness for which we laughed until we fell asleep in each others arms.</p> <p>A few days later I went to London again and the next time was very different but that was also a little more exciting for me. I'd had a few more drinks and the feeling was getting a little sore but I wasn't going to mention it just so I was not sure when I'd make my next move.</p> <p>This time was different and I had gone straight over to the local pub. There was no one else in the bar and as I approached the bar I saw that one of the guys just moved on. He was sitting where I had been sitting and we kept looking at each other. He had a good-looking face with the most beautiful eyes I'd ever seen and his hair was jet black which suited his rather attractive and Mediterranean look.</p> <p>"You have a lovely looking bum." he said.</p> <p>I gave him a dirtyâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
