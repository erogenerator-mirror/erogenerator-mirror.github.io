At the moment, all that was left was him, kissing her and caressing her. With his right hand, he gently unbuttoned her shirt, which she quickly pulled down, all the way to her ankles and, to the delight of the others, fell to the floor with her. The others watched as he removed her last garment and lay her back on the pool deck. His breath warmed her skin and sent a thrill through her at his touch. Her skin tingled as he lay beside her. He placed his hands on her chest and kissed every inch of her body while his hot gaze roamed her breasts.</p> <p>As his eyes traveled up her body he could hear her breathing quicken and her breasts heave. He raised himself off her, letting his fingers brush her nipples. She lay there, eyes closed, breathing deeply, waiting for some sort of order he might give her. He kissed her breasts, licking and nibbling as he went, until her breathing became fast again. He slid down until his face was level with her pussy. He was anxious to get started - if at all more than that. He kissed her pussy lips, moving to her clit, before licking it, and he heard her gasp and arch.</p> <p>"Do it please," she pleaded. "Suck me now," she whispered, in a husky voice. He licked her, slowly, wanting to make her cum more than anything else he could think of. Her taste was divine and his mouth was hot and wet. When he felt her relax, he moved in again and made her cum, hard. He loved how her pussy tasted, so wet and creamy. As her orgasm subsided, he kissed her thighs and kissed her stomach. Her pussy smelled so good and he was excited at the opportunity to taste it more thoroughly.</p> <p>He pulled off that skimpy top and began eating out her pussy again. His tongue was so sensitive to hers and when it met her clit the feelings caused a shudder to pass through her body. Her thighs closed tight around his head and he held her hips up so he could get deeper inside her. His hands were so soft at first, like the petals of her flower, but when he put her legs on his shoulders and tongued her harder, she grabbed a fistful of his hair. He sucked her clit, drawing it into his mouth and then using his tongue to pull off. It got harder to breathe because her hips were now moving against his face.</p> <p>He sucked harder and faster as she began to arch and groan. He felt it start to build in her pelvis and knew she was about to cum again. He pulled off his tongue and went down on her clit, sucking it with his lips and massaging it with his teeth. She screamed and began to cum again. Her body trembled and she grabbed him tightly. He held her firm and watched as she writhed, shivered repeatedly and finally went limp. When she looked up at him, he said "Did you like it?"</p> <p>"God yes," she replied. "It felt good."</p> <p>He slid the tip of his cock against her tight entrance and began to slowly push inside her. She gasped, "God that feels so hard."</p> <p>He continued to push himself inside, feeling all his nerve endings tingle. Her wetness helped and he was able to slide halfway in. He paused, letting her get used to his hardness. When she let out a small gasp, he pushed himself back in and began slowly, then faster. He could feel her pussy muscles sucking him in and he pushed himself fully into her body. Her breath was coming in ragged rasps now and her eyes were glazed. Her head was thrashing from side to side and her lips were quivering. He knew she would not be able to last long if he continued. He pulled out very slowly, still fully inside of her. He could feel her body, her walls, pulling at his cock. He wanted her to be as close as she could get. He kissed her neck and her breasts, sucking her nipples as he felt her respond to every touch. As he felt her body become more and more sensitive, he began to kiss her breasts and stomach as he started pounding into her.</p> <p>They kissed like that for what felt like hours. They moaned and squirmed in each others arms, letting the excitement build and then fall away again. Soon they started to pant as one and their bodies began to shake and shiver in unison. He collapsed on top of her, his hand caressing each other. She was a mess for them both and it was wonderful to hold her close to him, in each other's arms. As the waves and tremors subsided, he rolled out from underneath her.</p> <p>"I'll be back," was all he said.</p> <p>"Yes we will," she answered.<|endofâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
