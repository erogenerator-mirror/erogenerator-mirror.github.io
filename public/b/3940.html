"Please..."</p> <p>"Butch?" he said smiling.</p> <p>"No, not yet," She said.</p> <p>He stood up, turning to face her. "I'm not in the mood now for playing games." He pulled her towards the bed. She could barely make out the bed frame, her hand reaching for him. He pressed her against the bed, holding her, holding her. There was a look inside her, a look in her eyes that would've made him want to fuck her, but he didn't. He didn't want to.</p> <p>He grabbed her wrists and pulled her face towards him, kissing her deeply. The kiss led to a little cuddle, but he didn't pull her up to him.</p> <p>It made her think of the game. She had played it on her hands, but she had never found the courage to do it with him. And now he was doing it to her like none of the other men she had played before. It was crazy. And she didn't want it. If he kept her here, after the game, she might have to sneak around for the first day of the vacation. This was not what she wanted to do, but she had no choice.</p> <p>He pulled her top off, exposing her breasts, and he slid his pants down to his ankles. He lifted them over her face, and held them. "Beautiful." He whispered, leaning up to kiss her. "Just beautiful." He kissed and licked her breasts, sucking her nipples, making them hard and red. He let out a little moan when he felt her hand brush against his rigid cock. "Oh, I love you." And he kissed her again. Her body pressed against his with a strength that he never thought he would have to feel.</p> <p>"Is this what you want?" he said when their kissing finally broke.</p> <p>She looked up with confusion in her eyes. "How do these things get past you?"</p> <p>"Because I wanted to go slow," he said, laughing. "Your breasts were just the right size for you," he said in a low voice.</p> <p>She sat up slightly, making her breasts jiggle, making her nipples harden. "And you..." she blushed, "You'd like to be a little more aggressive, wouldn't you?"</p> <p>He pulled her hand away from his cock. "That's a big yes, I've told you that already?" But her hand stopped it before he could put it back on him.</p> <p>"It's okay. I'm not a big one of those little bimbo," she laughed, holding the sheet he had just pulled away from her.</p> <p>"But it was nice to have someone who wanted to try new things," he said. "Now we need to go slow."</p> <p>He kissed her again, and then lay her down on the bed. He pulled the sheet to her waist, exposing her sex to him. She looked at him with hungry eyes. "Will you play with me now?" she asked, already knowing the answer.</p> <p>He laid her back down. For the first time he touched her with a man. And yet he didn't mind this time of hers. He looked at her. They had been together since just after lunch yesterday. Had he lost track just now? His cock throbbed as his fingers touched her, the blood rising and flowing through its veins. She moaned. He touched his cock against her, running its head against her lips. She was wet, and he slid right in after a pause when he touched her, his cock sliding in her slickness. He put his arms around her and held her while his cock slid down her slit. She squeezed her legs together and he pushed further into her, still moving. They were both lost in their arousal, and he held her tighter while his cock sunk into her. "I didn't have an orgasm this morning because you wanted to fuck me," she moaned. It was so sensuous. "That is so unfair."</p> <p>He kissed her as his cock slid into her. "Because your hand was right up against my cock, watching me cum. And the way you were rubbing your clit."</p> <p>"Yes. I did, wasn't I?"</p> <p>"If you kept rubbing your clit, this would never happen." He lifted her legs up. She lifted her hips to him, and he slid his cock back into her again. She rubbed her clit up and down, her fingers touching him.</p> <p>"What do you think you're going to do, you little slut?" he whispered into her ear. "Will you just keep rubbing your clit?"</p> <p>"Please," she panted. "Don't stop."</p> <p>"Will you just keep rubbing your clit for me?" He askedâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
