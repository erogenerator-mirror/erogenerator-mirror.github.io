She looked at him with a playful smile. "I think you should go inside now, it's nearly dark and..." she paused as she looked at him, trying to decide what to say next, "I... am sorry about earlier, but I really couldn't help myself." Her voice quivered and her eyes dropped again. "And..." she continued, looking up at him, a smile playing across her lips, then her eyes started to glow, turning darker suddenly, "So, would you have a lot of money to spend this week? I'm sure you could buy a house in New Orleans, and you won't have to go back home without having it. You're very attractive."</p> <p>He stared at her as if he was a deer in the headlights, wondering what she was thinking. "You're beautiful..." he said quietly, feeling the heat in his cheeks rise to a fever pitch as she looked up at him. Their eyes locked again, as if she could see through him, making him feel as if he were an animal, or an insect. He felt the muscles in his leg tensing with the effort of trying to keep his voice under control. "I mean," he continued slowly, "I'm not exactly sure why you said it, that's just why I've heard you say it once."</p> <p>"And what, do you think I'm a slut?" she asked playfully, "Or, you do know that I'm available for a lot of things?" Her voice caught in her throat, but the smile on her face let it linger, and she didn't even wait for an answer. She leaned closer to him, her breath hot on his lips and neck, and her breasts pressed against his side, sending shivers down his spine.</p> <p>"But..." he said quietly and nervously, "You're the hottest thing I've ever seen." Her hand drifted from his hip to rest lightly on the soft ridge of his shoulder as the image of him fucking her from below filled his mind. She tilted her head to the side so that they could kiss, and her mouth opened almost as she did. He sucked the softness into his mouth briefly, then opened his eyes to stare into hers. Her lips were so soft, and she leaned into him slightly, so close that their breathing was like an electric jolt. He didn't know whether he wanted to kiss her right then, but he couldn't remember ever being so excited by anyone he'd ever kissed, and he didn't really care if it was his imagination or just pure instinct.</p> <p>His hands moved to grasp her shoulders, and he felt her shudder, the hot skin of her body against his. He could feel her nipples pressing into him, the soft, supple flesh of her breasts jiggling against him. He groaned into her mouth, his mouth coming up to meet hers, their mouths meeting for the first time. Their tongues met, their hands roaming from his shoulders to his chest, and their lips pressed firmly together. He felt the smoothness of her lips, the softness of her tongue on his lip, and it was as if a switch had to be turned on, or at least off, as their bodies seemed to part for a moment and he was aware of her breathing getting heavier.</p> <p>Her hands began to wander downward, their fingers brushing his chest and stomach as she began to kiss him, her tongue pressing against every square inch of his mouth. He felt both nervous and excited, and his arms went around her and pulled her body into his as their kiss became more passionate, their embrace becoming tighter and her tongue slipping into his mouth. Her left hand slipped into his hair, fingers caressing his scalp, and his right hand dropped to her waist, moving it slowly down, over her hip, and between the thin folds of her belly.</p> <p>She had just stopped kissing him when he suddenly felt her breath come in ragged little gasps at the apex of her thighs, and his hand moved up again to her breast, fingers pulling the soft breast out of the confines of her bra. He wanted to kiss her so much right now, but he didn't have any where to go. With no help she would never want to be kissed by another man, but he was so turned on, his penis would have been ready to explode. Her lips parted a little as a moan escaped her lips; his hands slid down and under her top, then up again. He cupped her bare breast in his hand and held it against his palm, loving the way her nipples seemed to burn him. He couldn't get enough of her touch, though, so he kissed her lightly on her lips again and ran his fingertip under her bra strap, trying to coax it free from her skin a little.
