We looked at each other with the same expression of a silent parent or sibling. I could feel how aroused I was.</p> <p>"Slave! You've been a bad slave! You've been here for too long!" His voice was stern and harsh. He had tears in his eyes. "You may think that everything is alright, but I think you're getting old right now. You should take a shower, shave all the hair from your body. I have made sure that there will be no sex in the shower, so there is no need for you to wash your hair or shower while you're in your chastity belt. You can take a shower on the condition that you are wearing that device while I'm in your bathroom, and it's locked, so you can't use it without being punished, or your punishment. I told you, you will do what you are told without complaints, and I'm afraid that that I'll have to punish you again, after the shower is through with you. That means you will wear it all morning. When I'm away, you can remove it, and wash it off with your mouth. It's been a while. Now lie down and close your eyes and go to sleep. I can't wait to see the expression of your face on your hands and face when you're asleep."</p> <p>The look on his face was one of deep frustration and sadness. "How will I do when you've got that thing in you?" I thought to myself. I had to admit that I wasn't sure that I could manage the device and use it, or, at least, I was going slowly. I couldn't even get the damn thing off me. I was in such pain and the humiliation was too much. I began to get up off of the edge of the bed, when I felt someone take off my blindfold. There were bright red roses in their hands. "Slave. How dare you take such good care of me! You're a slave! Now come to my room and make yourself comfortable in my bed, and then let me have a look at you." He told me and then he vanished, leaving me alone with my thoughts.</p> <p>Chapter 8 – The morning before my punishment</p> <p>I slept very soundly that night, and when I got up, I felt as if every bone in my body was shaking with frustration. I don't know where I got the strength to continue my education but it had to be done. I had to get out of there and try to get out of my own body as well. Once I had done this, I resolved to go through with my punishment anyway. I was going to do my job. But, I couldn't just take it like I knew I was supposed to do it, and let Master go out and do whatever he was going to do! I had no way of finding an appropriate punishment, or punishment, or other things for which I was to be punished! I really hoped he didn't take it any farther than he already had and was just going to keep on going. I really wanted to go on with being my Master's slave! I couldn't believe I was going to feel my Master get up and take my chastity belt off without waking me up first. I wanted all those silly things, and more, but now I had to get it over with. I wanted to get out of there as far away from Master as possible. I thought that once I'd stripped off and had gotten my chastity belt off, I'd try to escape. I still didn't know what was going on with my wrists and ankles, since they were locked and I couldn't get out of them at all. All I knew was that I was sure as hell wasn't going anywhere. Oh well, I didn't care anymore.</p> <p>I got myself into bed in the bathroom and went to my room. I decided that I was going to do it. I'd do it if I had my own car. That's how I knew how to get out. I had already made reservations for the evening dinner, and I already felt that I had enough food there, so the only thing left I had to do was get an apartment. And if that wasn't enough, I was going to get lucky! It was getting late, and I was having a hell of a time getting my key out. After making sure I had everything I needed, I stripped and crawled into bed, not caring where I landed.</p> <p>I tried to think about what was going on outside of my bedroom, but what I was able to tell was that I was having an affair with my Master! I couldn't believe it! He could easily put that thing in me! I wanted to call it off, but he wouldn't! I tried to calm down by telling him that that's all I was doing, but I just kept on lying—</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
