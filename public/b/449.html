He pulls out. "I am so fucking full. My cum is so fucking hot in there baby" and then the feeling of the warm cum in my stomach begins. He pulls out. "I have to lick all this cum out of your pussy. This can never happen again, you know that right? I love you so much, it's too bad that you can't see me now" and then his tongue snakes around my clit and slowly licks it. "Ohhhhhhhhhhh yesssssssssss, I love you so much Baby"</p> <p>My mind is spinning, "I love you too, it's too fucking wrong, I don't want to be with you, I want to be with you"</p> <p>I feel him climb up from me. And then I can sense his cum, the taste, the smells, and feel the warm feeling all around me, like it is there, deep inside me. I begin to feel my cum begin to move around, around, and move on me, but instead of touching me, it starts to move, and it does not want to move. It moves, it's rubbing my clit on it's own. Ohhhh, it does the rest of it. "Ohhhh, yesss it feels so good inside me, ohhhh, it feels good too, "Ohhhh, yessssssssssss, it's good, so good, ohhhh goddddddddd, that's it Baby"</p> <p>I know that I never want this to end, it never will, and the feeling I felt, my body was on fire. When I felt him begin to move above me, his hands on my hips, his cock deep in to my pussy, I was lost, lost in his touch. It was the one feeling in my body that never wanted the feeling that I wanted now. But then, I felt it, the feeling my entire body craved. He slid slowly out and then he was again in position between my legs.</p> <p>His cock is now at my pussy, and as I feel him slide in. This feels so fucking good." I feel him begin to move out until he just brushes my clit. "Ohhhh, Godddddddd, It's so good, it's like nothing else. Ohhhh Godddd yessssssssssss"</p> <p>It felt so fucking good, his cock, moving, and feeling, it was hard and throbbing inside me. I felt it, and felt myself wanting more.</p> <p>He slid back slowly, making my pussy slowly, so, I can barely feel his cock within me, so slow, so slow. But the feeling is just so damn good, it never feels this good before. I felt as if he was sliding it all the way into my pussy. In and out I felt, I felt him sliding, the feeling of being totally connected to him, the feeling of making love to my body. I felt his finger on my clit, and his cock began to move. Slowly at first, but then faster, just a little faster. I could feel it all the way in, each stroke, each time I felt the warm feeling of pleasure building in my pussy, in my pussy. And then as I felt it starting, I felt it, the first hard, hot, throbbing, orgasmic cum of my life begin. It started with a tiny, slight vibration in my pussy, and as I felt it, like this intense feeling was building, I felt him cumming in my pussy. He slid, and then he slid back until just his cock was still within me. We stayed like this for a long time, kissing, cuddling, touching, as he gently slid himself in and out. I did not say a word about what just happened, I just took it in and enjoyed it.</p> <p>After what seemed like minutes of kissing, cuddling, cuddling, and rubbing each other all over, he rolled me onto my back and slid out of me for as I felt myself on the edge of orgasm again. He pulled me on to my side, turned to face me, and then he slid two soft, warm, and wet fingers in to my pussy. He said, "Baby you looked like you could do anything. That was so hot, and exciting. It made me really, really hot too. When I felt his hand on my clit, the orgasm began right there, right then, it was like an orgasm every time I let the heat build. I had never felt cum like this before, only it really felt so fucking hot" His fingers were doing magic, bringing me up to this world, down there.</p> <p>"It was fucking hard to cum when I felt you cum, but I felt it. And my whole body was on fireâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
