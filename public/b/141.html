He slipped his hands up the back of her calves. She arched her head back. His finger began to slide around the back of her calf. He knew the time she would be awake in no time.</p> <p>His hand slid back up the backs of Lisa's thighs. He squeezed gently at her buttocks. He felt the muscles of her inner thighs pressing against his fingers. He pressed forward again, gently.</p> <p>She stirred slightly, opening her eyes and smiling.</p> <p>"Saul, honey," she said in a sleepy voice.</p> <p>His hand slid up to brush the short hair covered outer lips of her pussy.</p> <p>They both smiled.</p> <p>Saul reached out and ran his fingers up the length of her slit. It was so moist that he knew he could easily push his middle finger inside her. She stirred again. He slipped another finger into her channel. He pulled them out, sliding out and then pressing against her ass. He teased her clit. As she grew in his hand she began to push her mound up toward him, trying to get both fingers inside her. He gently pinched and pulled her swollen nipples as she began to writhe and moan.</p> <p>"Oh, my!" his wife wailed.</p> <p>He slipped a third finger into her and let her move her hips faster and deeper. He continued rubbing the pad of his middle finger against her ass and her clitoris as she fucked herself against his hand. The sensation was marvelous.</p> <p>Saul leaned forward so he could take Lisa's mouth into his while he continued to tease and massage the inside of her vagina. It had been so long since it had been touched by another male other than his own. The excitement of the day was beginning to get to him again. He reached one hand around to start to massage her clitoris between his thumb and forefinger. She gasped and moaned and writhed as he increased his speed and pressure on her clit and her hips. As his fingers fluttered over the nub of her clitoris it drew her close, almost coming with it.</p> <p>"Oh, please don't stop. Ohh!" she moaned.</p> <p>He didn't hear her as he stopped his ministrations and his thumb went to a stop on her clitoris. His other hand returned and he rubbed his fingers over her clitoris in long circular motions, all the while pushing his fingers against her ass and clit in unison with his hand.</p> <p>"AHHH! FUCK! Yes! Yes! Ahhhhhh!" Lisa gasped out. Her hips pushed up hard.</p> <p>Saul's fingers continued their pattern of stimulation. Up and down, up and down, back and forth, from bottom to top in counterpoint to his other index finger, now alternating left to right on her clitoris as he alternated between twisting and thrusting against her. He added a little pressure with his fingertip and she began to shudder and jerk even more. He continued to rub and finger her clit until she reached a final orgasm. She held onto himself with both hands as it surged through her.</p> <p>"AHHHHHHHH! That was good! I'm commmmmmminnnng! Your fingers feel soooo nice!"</p> <p>They remained motionless like that for several minutes.</p> <p>Lisa's breathing evened out and her eyes closed her head leaned back against Saul's chest.</p> <p>When she opened her eyes again she found herself staring at him with her mouth slightly open.</p> <p>He lifted the sheet over his body as if it was nothing.</p> <p>"Now that I am done pleasuring you, we can do something else."</p> <p>With that he rolled her over and placed her on her back. As her legs reached out he pushed them to almost side to side. When she reached down and spread them to get a better look he leaned forward and placed the head of his dick at the rim of her labia.</p> <p>She looked down, seeing the tip of it in the split of her thighs.</p> <p>She tried to close her legs, but his hold was so forceful her body resisted.</p> <p>"I'm not quite ready yet," he said as he looked down.</p> <p>"What do you mean?"</p> <p>"You know what I mean. I'm going to put the head of it into you."</p> <p>He had been rubbing himself against the outside of her thighs. His weight seemed to lift the bed with every thrust.</p> <p>Lisa felt him pull his legs into some kind of wide saddle. Her face was inches from the tip.</p> <p>"I've never.. uh.. done this in bed before. I never.. um... done it in anyone's room."</p> <p>With that he lowered the front of his body on top of Lisaâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
