She said. "I could just give up now."</p> <p>She was right; I did want to, but didn't want to fight it. "But that'd be crazy."</p> <p>Her head nodded and she smiled.</p> <p>* * *</p> <p>The first night of the cruise was a fun time for us, getting to know each other. She'd been in a very long relationship before her marriage, and had gone to college. After a short stay in her room, I was at a friend's and we started talking. There was plenty to do, a lot of drinking and flirting on the ship, but it was nice to get to know her.</p> <p>After a pleasant evening together, after some more heavy make-out, she asked me if I had any idea what my flight would be for the day, and I thought about what if-and-when. I was a little embarrassed that I already had to leave on the plane, and told her that I'd be over shortly to pick up a drink and some snacks. Then I excused myself and headed off to the bar where I usually kept the bar stocked. The bar had all the drink and snacks in it, but even if I was to get a bottle or three, I didn't have to drink alcohol. There was even a few places to sit. It looked like there was a great bar in our part of the city, and I was always glad to get a small drink after a full day there. She had a little drink of her own, and she had a couple more, although I'd been given a bottle of her juice to drink.</p> <p>She looked good. Sexy, but I could tell by how she looked at me that she wasn't wearing anything under her dress. I was hoping that she had nothing on underneath her dress as I was. Maybe, I thought, it might be a man trying to get a glimpse of the inside of her pussy, as my pants would be bulging all through the night. Or maybe it was because she looked just so damn sexy. Maybe she would be wearing something under her dress too, but I would be very unlikely to be able to make out her in my pants right now.</p> <p>I had already made one drink from what I had been toasting and I ordered her another one as soon as I ordered it. I ordered another drink for myself, and ordered another drink along with my vodka half-cups. I looked around at the people coming and went for my order. I wanted to get back to enjoying the scenery at home as much I could, but I was also hoping that something would happen, and so did she.</p> <p>I ordered another drink for her, and sat close to her as we talked. The music was loud, and I was enjoying it. I was only sitting a few feet away from her, and couldn't see her. I wasn't sure if this was just the alcohol talking, it did sound to me like she was sitting right next to me. I couldn't see her at all, but she was on something, so she seemed to be rubbing against me as she talked to me. I was hoping that she would pull back away from me and lean across the dance floor, but she didn't.</p> <p>I turned around and continued to sipped on my drink and listen as she talked to me, but was also hoping that something would happen. The music had taken on an interesting edge as my head continued to move with the beat as we talked and drank. I couldn't see what she was doing with her body to, but I could hear her talking to me, so I guessed that she was just talking to me and that she had other things to talk about herself.</p> <p>She had a couple of drinks before I'd finished my. She looked up as I was finishing my third.</p> <p>"What is the matter?" she asked me. "You look like you are a little dizzy."</p> <p>"Why do you think that?" I asked her, hoping that I was a gentleman enough to drink away her discomfort. I wasn't sure how we should act here, but, if I'm going to be sitting next to a sexy woman I would love nothing more than to sit next to her.</p> <p>"I'm sorry," she said.</p> <p>Her eyes met mine as we said the phrase.</p> <p>"No, I see what you're doing." She answered me with the smile that I loved, even though this was something that I had to talk to her about and try to make her feel better about it.</p> <p>Even with the fact that her body might be rubbing against me, and I had already had my drink, I was still having a bit of trouble putting the thought in my head. At least, until someone walked past us from a crowd, and when she saw that, the look on her face turned up considerably. No wonder she was doing to me, right in frontâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
