Her boyfriend was with her, and when they pulled up at my house she asked, "Where are you going?"</p> <p>"I have to talk to him for a minute."</p> <p>"Can you tell him that you are pregnant?"</p> <p>"I'm sorry but I just lost it. They both say it is not safe."</p> <p>"I think you should leave home. I really want you to stay. You know where you could park at any time and drive through in time."</p> <p>She started crying, but stopped in her tracks. "It's too late to come to your place. We can even use the bathroom there. What do we do?"</p> <p>"My parents won't even know. There's no telling what mom and dad will think about it."</p> <p>"I got to go though. I had better watch what I wear tonight, or I'll be leaving before I get to meet my daddy."</p> <p>"That's right, let's go find your parents."</p> <p>We walked down to the parking lot and had to get a seat in my SUV. A few minutes later we were back at the club. "Let's go in and get something to eat, your parents will be waiting for you."</p> <p>"They want to meet you and I wanted them to have a good time with you."</p> <p>"Thank you for being there and supporting me." I drove through the parking lot to my parents' house. I parked in the garage and went in with them. We spent the night chatting up Mom, and she was as excited as a pig in heat. She was so happy to see everyone and I felt it was time we started getting ready for the big day.</p> <p>We finished the food and got into the shower. As the hot water flowed over us Mom told me, "I love the hair." I soaped her up and then rinsed her off as she ran for the house. The hot water ran over all of us until we were totally clean.</p> <p>"What if you take me to bed?" Mom asked with a huge grin.</p> <p>"I don't think I can do it."</p> <p>"But you'll find something to wear. I saw you in the men's room one time, and I know what you will put on for yourself."</p> <p>"I know but I will find something. Besides, with you here this week, I'll just stay and hang out with the people we are going to be visiting." Mom walked into the bedroom naked except for her wedding ring.</p> <p>"If you are going to stay in the same bed with me tonight, I think we should go out on the town."</p> <p>Mom gave me a big hug and then hugged me back. It was a little awkward for both of us. It was a little awkward when she wrapped her arms around me, but she looked so happy that I couldn't take it anymore. We kissed passionately as she ran her fingers all over my body. "I love you so much."</p> <p>"I love you too."</p> <p>With this statement we hugged again as we slipped out of our bathrobe. I was already naked and walking towards Mom with her dress in my hands when my father asked me, "Do you feel guilty about tonight?"</p> <p>"Do you feel you aren't ready for the baby yet?"</p> <p>"No, I feel good that you're ready."</p> <p>"When does your father get home?"</p> <p>"Oh, he's going to be home tomorrow. I'm sure he doesn't really want to sleep around tonight, but I hope you're okay with it."</p> <p>"I'm perfectly okay with it. It's my baby."</p> <p>"So this is the end. We're just going to wait till it's time to have our baby."</p> <p>"Yes, I'm sure there will be time when you were away. There's more than just this. You have to make a choice right now, not until you know about us.</p> <p>"I've been going steady ever since you took my virginity."</p> <p>"I have no intention of stopping that, because I want to be with you."</p> <p>"There are plenty of things that I want to be with you, that you'll find enjoyable. Please tell me where I can find your father and let me help you with those things." When she finished her sentence her hand came up to caress my cheek. "But I only think there may be a problem in my mind. I still don't understand you."</p> <p>"Don't worry, I understand. My thoughts come from behind a mirror. I'm never really afraid of anything, except for a few simple things, but I don't think I could do that to you right nowâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
