That cock, fuckin' my married ass! Ahh! You fuck me so well! Thats it!" she cried as he slammed in.</p> <p>"Yeah, baby. Work it hard," he whispered in her ear, rubbing her clit with his thumb while his thrusts quickened.</p> <p>"AHHH! FUCK! That's so damn good! Keep fuckin' me with that big dick! AHHH! OHHHHH! Ohhhh! So good!"</p> <p>"Damn, baby, you got a great ass," he said as he kissed her and reached around with both hands to finger her clit.</p> <p>She held tight to his shoulders, digging her nails into his flesh, and began to squeal loudly as she came hard with him inside her. She was so close. She was never so close either. Not even after the first day.</p> <p>He let go of her clit to help her steady herself, and slowly withdrew his cock from her.</p> <p>"Oh my God... I can feel it," she moaned as he turned off the water.</p> <p>She took the soap and gave it a quick wash, then turned around and faced him.</p> <p>"C'mon. You better rinse off, though. I don't want you to go off, either," she said.</p> <p>"Honey, I am not gonna be out all night with your husband fucking my ass."</p> <p>"I know. But we'll be back here in a couple of hours to get my pussy waxed. We could go back and look in the mirror."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>She took his head into her hands, kissing his lips, his neck, and finally reached down to his cock. It was limp in her hand. She licked her lips. Then she smiled.</p> <p>"You'll be out in 5 sec."</p> <p>Then she took a quick washcloth and wiped her hand clean. He stood up, dried off in the bathroom, then walked her to the bed. He sat her down on the end.</p> <p>"Are you going to sit on the edge of that bed, baby?"</p> <p>She smiled. Then, as gently as she could, she turned and lay down on the side of him. Her head was on his chest, and his left hand still fondled her right breast.</p> <p>"That was... nice," she said, then looked up when the clock said it was almost 11PM.</p> <p>"It'd better be as nice and late as you are."</p> <p>"Honey, I'm not going to go back to work."</p> <p>"Oh. You know how it is. I love working with you. It's a little... personal, isn't it?"</p> <p>"No. No. It's just.... personal."</p> <p>"Well, guess what? My pussy is waiting for it just fine tonight.... and... that big cock of yours is gonna be inside my pussy soon. Now, let's go."</p> <p>They finished their shower together, sharing the tepid water. They kissed and giggled as they bathed each other, then they began to shave themselves. He had already applied the conditioner for her body hair, and when she stood and stepped out of them, hair was already beginning to come down her legs. She had them shaved to his liking.</p> <p>Back at home, he packed away his laptop and was gone to get ready for work in a few minutes. Then they put on their pajamas, and fell asleep. He was awakened by a soft knock on the door.</p> <p>"Darling?" she said cheerfully.</p> <p>"Yes?"</p> <p>"It's so early. I'd really like for you to come by the office and help me at some of the new products I've been getting, and then come back here tomorrow to see me. But, if you can't make it, it's okay. I think you'll enjoy the time you have in Atlanta."</p> <p>Dawn's answer was to take his hand and lead him to the bedroom. She pulled the sheets back, then got naked and turned the lights out before the bed was even turned down.</p> <p>She slipped into the bed, and then got under the covers, with him right in front of her. She ran her fingers up and down his chest and stomach, and she kissed him once. He groaned as she stroked his cock, bringing it to full erection.</p> <p>"Get over here, baby, and give me that beautiful cock of yours now," she said, running her lips down his chest.</p> <p>He obliged by taking her hand and pulling her up onto the bed while he stood beside the bed. His cock was hard and standing straight up, almost bouncing just a little. He grabbed it, and gently began to stroke it. She wrapped her arms around his shoulders and began to softly kiss his neckâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
