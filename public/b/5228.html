When the waiter approached I took my seat at the end of the bar.</p> <p>The man at the other end of the bar was about to be seated when someone leaned in to him. I thought it was a woman, but it was several years older. She looked about twenty years older than me and was a couple of inches taller than my thirty- five. I was looking at her with lust, almost of her head as she pulled out her glass of wine and handed it to me.</p> <p>"To a life of sexual exploration and adventure!" she smiled at me. Just before the tableau in front of us began to change I felt a hand press against my thigh. Her hand moved up quickly and I felt the back of her fingers move along my thigh as she whispered seductively. In a flash my thoughts were turning into lustful feelings. My own cock began to harden with a pulse of desire.</p> <p>My heart raced as she whispered to me while placing the wine glass on the bar and sipping up her wine. It took him a little longer than she realized before I felt her fingers slide along my upper thigh. I didn't have a clue where the fingers had come from, but I soon felt them move to the hem of my skirt and begin to move along my inner thighs. At that point the man at the other end of the bar smiled at the couple and he quickly excused himself.</p> <p>I looked around the room, to see if there was anyone else on the other end. There were a few more people milling about, but they looked as tired and well behaved as I felt. I began to feel the familiar warm feeling of arousal begin, but was soon unable to suppress the feeling. It was very late and the band was leaving. The crowd thinned out a bit as the bartender came over and paid our bill.</p> <p>She leaned over and whispered, "I think you enjoyed that, didn't you?"</p> <p>Without taking my mouth away from hers I nodded in reply.</p> <p>As the band began to leave she reached over turned on the stereo switch. The dim light of the moon danced gently across her hair and my eyes caught a beautiful sight as my eyes caught a man who was at my table. He was a man standing with one arm behind my back, his other hand over my shoulder. He had his right arm across my breasts as he leaned in to kiss my neck again. I was aware of his cock pressing hard against me through my dress and his fingers playing with my nipples.</p> <p>"Are you enjoying this?" he leaned closer, his cock pressing firmly against my crotch through his pants. I looked up into his eyes to see the stranger standing next to my table looking a little nervous, but quickly returned his eye contact and lowered her voice. "Enjoying yourself, aren't you?"</p> <p>Without turning she stood, turned and led the way out the door to her car. She was wearing a green skirt with high-heeled shoes and a white blouse that buttoned low but showed a lot of cleavage. As she pulled out of the parking lot she turned, gave me a smile and a kiss, reached across and gently rubbed my cheek.</p> <p>"Are you ready to take me to bed?"</p> <p>That question made the night so many more sexual surprises.</p> <p>As soon as they arrived home I stood up for the lights, walked toward the sofa naked except for my panties, turned around with a smile on my face and said, "Are you ready to show me you love me?"</p> <p>My hands reached to pull down my panty line, but then turned and led the way to the bedroom. As soon as we entered I took off my panties, walked naked in front of him, and then bent over while giving him a brief peak at my backside on display. His cock was already hard as he pulled a condom from his pants pocket. As the front of his pants opened he stepped right in and pushed his cock into me. A moan escaped my lips, as the pleasure of the experience overwhelmed me. I fell on the bed and spread my legs wide open for him.</p> <p>Before he began, I looked at him over my shoulder. He was standing just behind me with a very erect cock. He leaned forward and said, "Now I'm going to fuck you so you can't wait for me."</p> <p>He slowly began to move his cock between my pussy lips. I placed my hand on his ass and began to encourage him to drive it home. I felt his cock move deeper in me before it started to get a little slippery with the pre-cum oozing from the tip at the opening. I began to caress his ass as he continued to stroke my pussy. He pulled out a little and then slammed it home and began to pound it into me. It didn't take long for me to climax againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
