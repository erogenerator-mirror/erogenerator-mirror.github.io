I slowly made my way toward the exit. The thought of letting my son go had made me nauseous and yet the thought of having to leave him, my only son, in the middle of a snow storm made me excited. I knew it didn't matter anymore. I knew I couldn't lose control of the situation and it was time I had time to think about what had happened.</p> <p>I was about to open the door when the snow came out of nowhere and it hit me in the face. I reached for it with both arms and I felt it as it clung to my face. It was the first time I felt anything that cold, thick and sticky. I had not seen or felt anything like it in years. I started to pull the door open and when I did I dropped to my knees in the snow and felt so exposed. It was like I had no place to escape except at the bottom. I started crying and when I stood up I realized that no one but Jamie would come to see me. It was like we had been at that moment when everything changed forever. I was torn and yet I still liked what I had seen.</p> <p>When I opened the door and looked back down at the snow covered face that stared at me, I knew I had to stay. It was as though all of our lives had changed dramatically already. I couldn't let that happen again. I couldn't let the emotions that had coursed through me become part of me, becoming part of me all over again. I wanted to let it all go but I knew I couldn't.</p> <p>The room was spinning and it wasn't a good time to be going to the bathroom or doing anything else. I walked over to the table where my books and laptop were sitting and looked at them. I found them and pulled one out and started to look through the files, wondering what I was doing wrong. I decided I needed to call it quits and get back to my school so that I knew what had gone and what was coming. I got up and walked toward the door.</p> <p>"Can we go now please? I was starting to get worried, I know I've been out here a lot longer. Please just take me back to my room, right now and leave me alone!" Jamie pleaded softly as he walked toward me.</p> <p>I watched him as he stared back at me. It was so hard for me to see him for what he was and I had to see him, I had to see what he really was not just a son but more of a grown man that his father. I shook my head and walked into his room.</p> <p>It was small but comfortable and I had to lay down on the bed. I felt like such a small mouse and I couldn't think of anything else but Jamie. I could hardly move because I felt like I was naked and I couldn't think of anything to touch or even say. I knew I would never touch him and yet I couldn't move to touch him. I was going nowhere, I had to see him.</p> <p>I grabbed my shirt off the bed and then ran back to my room and threw on my jeans and shoes. I picked up a chair that I had bought and sat down. I put on only my bra and looked at the pictures of my sons on the wall. I knew now that I liked what I saw. It was as much as it was a woman's look for her to have something so pretty and that she would not get a divorce but still make him her son. I wondered if I could even handle the pain of losing my son. It was so hard. I closed my eyes and let the tears come.</p> <p>The tears started falling in thick drops down my cheeks, they looked so sexy. I held them as I felt more tears and I cried harder until I just couldn't hold it anymore. I looked up and the face that stared back at me with such sad eyes, was still looking back at me. I wiped them away and closed my eyes, letting the tears fall onto my face. The tears were starting to flow in my own ears and I was starting to cry harder. I ran my fingers over my cheeks and then wiped away the tears and ran my hand through my hair.</p> <p>I laid quietly in bed. It would be ok, I would never leave him, he needed to know something and I couldn't let it bother him. He could stay in school forever but I knew that he knew that I had to leave. He had been so nice to me. I thought about how I had always felt when I wanted something and I felt like now. There was nothing else for me to think about. Everything had changed but I thought maybe more.
