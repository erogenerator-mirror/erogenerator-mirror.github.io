"I've only ever done it with my boyfriend. I'm not as drunk as I normally am. I'll just have to try."</p> <p>Beth's hand began to caress her friend's hair and she sighed into the kiss. Slowly, her hand was working its way up Beth's neck to tease her ear and nibble on the other earlobe. Beth moaned into the kiss and pulled her roommate into the embrace. Beth slid her other hand around her neck and pressed her friend against the table.</p> <p>Beth pulled the front clasp of her shirt loose and her body immediately began to tremble as Beth's fingers explored her bare breasts.</p> <p>"Beth..." A moan began to build in her throat as Beth's long finger slipped into the waistband of the shorts she was wearing.</p> <p>"Kiss me!" She urged as she pressed her friend closer to the surface. Beth's fingers slid under the elastic and plunged into the folds of her friend's pussy.</p> <p>Suddenly, her eyes flew open and she was looking straight into her roommates soulful face.</p> <p>"Oh my God." Her voice trembled as she tried to catch her breath. "He's going to have me do it with Mike."</p> <p>"Me too.." Beth purred against her mouth.</p> <p>"I can smell the sex on him all the way out here and...oh my God." She exclaimed. "I'm not kidding about the sex thing anymore."</p> <p>She pulled her roommate closer to her and began to kiss her again. Beth was moaning in protest against the kiss and pulling at her roommate's shirt. After all there was nothing anyone could do to stop it, they didn't stop.</p> <p>They pulled apart from each other and she began to slowly peel the shirt upward. Beth's back was to the young man of her roommate, as she reached behind it backside for the zipper on her roommate's skirt. She could barely get the zipper in but it did little to cover the bare skin of her friend's ass.</p> <p>"It feels so good between us!" Beth exclaimed when the shorts were sliding down her friend's slim legs and she could practically feel the warmth of her pussy against her thigh. Her friend's legs parted wider than usual and Beth's body slipped into the softness of her roommate's.</p> <p>Cindy gasped as she felt her friend's fingers slide beneath the tight fabric of their friend's bikini panties. Her eyes moved to Mike's hard penis. She gasped and pulled her friend's bottom free.</p> <p>"Ohh god....Ohhh Goddddd!" Beth moaned as she felt Beth's other hand slide underneath her friend. Beth's hand was buried inside her roommate as they shared the first contact of the tongues to each other in so long.</p> <p>Cindy's tongue went wild against her own and she arched her body toward her new friend. Beth began to pump her fingers in and out of her friend's pussy as they began kissing again. Beth's mouth opened wider and their two tongues thrust frantically across each others' lips.</p> <p>"Fuck me!" Cindy moaned as she pressed the soft lips back to her roommates mouth.</p> <p>Beth's hips were rising to meet hers as she plunged two fingers deep inside of her roommate. Cindy moaned again and wrapped her legs around Beth's waist. She could barely move as her pussy contracted around Beth's hand. Her breathing quickened and her heart raced as the orgasm was just moments away.</p> <p>"Oh god, please, I can't take anymore..." She panted. "I need you."</p> <p>"Do it!" Beth purred. "Make me cum!"</p> <p>"Cum!" Cindy implored as she pulled back against her roommate.</p> <p>Beth began to finger her friend again, slowly at first. Her hips rocked as she began to match her friend's thrusts. Her arms and legs began to tremble as she began to lose control. She could only hold onto her roommates' hair as she cried out into her roommate's mouth.</p> <p>Beth's head rolled upward as her body began to tremble. She closed her eyes and felt Cindy's tongue slide out between her own lips and lick her face. The kiss got longer as they both came together. Her back arching, her legs shaking, she came again and again.</p> <p>"Oh God!" The moan was louder and more frantic now as her legs clamped their grasp onto Beth's waist.</p> <p>"Oh my God I'm cumming again!" She grunted as her mouth pressed against her roommate's. Her legs trembled around her friend's body as she shook as much as the sea.</p> <p>"Yessss..." Cindy begged. "Make me cum againâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
