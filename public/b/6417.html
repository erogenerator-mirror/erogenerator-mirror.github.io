Her smile had returned.</p> <p>We finished our coffee and made our way to Mrs. M's house. We spent the next hour or so making out. I'd always found the thought of women's bodies in my mind. Some of my male friends had asked if I'd ever been with another woman. Of course there has never been any question why it would be a turn-on, and I had always thought them to be beautiful, soft, and tasty, with small, but very inviting mounds that I suckled and kneaded while my fingers slid over their nipples and tweaked them.</p> <p>Eventually we arrived, and I helped her into the front door. I closed the door behind her. I took one of the boxes I had in my car and carried it into the kitchen.</p> <p>"Did I just hear you say "I love you"?" she asked in a voice that was like her voice just before her head was tilted back to me and her eyes locked with mine. She wore a cute little pink dress that just barely covered her breasts. Underneath it she wore black thigh-high patent leather 5-inch stilettos. The heels made her legs look even slimmer. We kissed once and I pulled her to me, kissing her cheek gently, and she purred as I lifted her face back to mine. Her perfume tickled my nose. I pushed it out and inhaled the scent. My mouth trailed along her jaw and neck as I kissed her.</p> <p>"You smell wonderful," she said.</p> <p>"Thank you, Mrs. M," I replied.</p> <p>I pulled back from her and kissed her again. "We don't have to," she said, her eyes flashing blue as she said it.</p> <p>I stepped back and pulled the robe down from my body, leaving just my bra and boxers underneath. I turned to close the door behind me, and she caught my eye. I heard a "Thank you" in her voice.</p> <p>"We'll go out someplace," she said. She took the box from me, taking the robe from me. "Let me get these for you." She handed me a box and opened the box inside. I looked at it for a moment, and her eyes grew wide, saying, "That's really a condom." I smiled at her. "I think I can live with that." I gave her a quick kiss. "Thank you for the kind words." I turned back to the door. "Let me put these in the bathroom to dry."</p> <p>I followed her, a big smile on my face. I had never been in a bathroom before, and I almost got sick. I put the box down and stood next to her.</p> <p>"Are you sure?"</p> <p>"Absolutely," I said. "The moment your pussy is nice and loose, I'll take care of it."</p> <p>"Thank you," she said.</p> <p>I stepped closer to her, putting both hands in the small of her back. Our lips met, and for some reason her scent intoxicated me. Her full lips were soft and slightly parted. I rubbed my lips along hers, and she pulled my lips further onto hers, parting them with my tongue. A light moan emerged from her mouth. I put my tongue down a bit and she pushed her tongue against my mouth. I felt how soft and warm it was. It was like putting my tongue into her mouth, where there were none of these things there and had hers a good distance apart from each other. I felt the slight pressure of her hand down my back as she rubbed me there lightly.</p> <p>I slid my palm down across her backside and let my finger wander down her crack as it gently slid over her mound. I felt her shift as my fingertip touched her. I pressed down and slipped my finger inside of her as my lips met her tongue. She pushed my finger further as our tongues began to entwine. I found her clit and gently began to stroke it. She moaned and ground her hips into my hand as I began to fuck her with my finger.</p> <p>"That feels good." She said through our kisses. I could feel the wetness that had formed as she had opened her legs and pressed into it. I could feel my own wetness, but as I probed the entrance to her vagina it didn't take long for her to get the hint. She pressed a little harder into me, and I had to slow down and let go of her.</p> <p>"What are you doing?" she asked.</p> <p>"I'm just getting you undressed," I said.</p> <p>We made it to the bedroom and I stripped her off of the robe. She lifted her legs off the side of the bed to make way, and I was on my knees at the endâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
