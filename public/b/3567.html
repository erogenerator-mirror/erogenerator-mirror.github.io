You guys are so lucky to have guys like that." She sighed as she got up the courage to speak.</p> <p>"Yeah I know I was just joking."</p> <p>"No you were fucking perfect too." I grinned.</p> <p>"How could I?" he said, reaching for his wallet to grab a twenty. He had been holding his money. "I mean don't you think we should at least finish our drinks then?" I asked.</p> <p>"I suppose you're right. I just hope it doesn't piss off my husband too much." he pouted.</p> <p>I shook my head and chuckled as I sipped my drink.</p> <p>"So how did you guys meet?" she asked.</p> <p>"Well, we met at the bar and I got a blowjob from one of the hottest guys in our class." I replied.</p> <p>"He said he would give that some serious consideration," she stated. "So what are you guys doing now?" she queried.</p> <p>"We are heading home." I answered. "We don't mind if you want to join us so long as the man is willing to do it before it's too late." I informed her.</p> <p>"That's just great." She exclaimed as she got up the courage to get up. "Do I have a shot?" she asked. We agreed and she leaned down in order to talk with me as she reached for my cock.</p> <p>She grabbed it with her hand and slowly rubbed it up and down my shaft through my pants. She was still looking at me, but she was also trying to imagine how this would go if it didn't go this far. "Hmmm that feels nice," she mewed. "Are you ready for a ride?" she asked. "Come on in and let's go," I told her. "I've had a bit too much to drink and I want to see it all right here." she smiled at me.</p> <p>We got in her car and I got behind the seat as she drove and we started off. The coolness of the night was comforting to me as we left the pub. She seemed to be so comfortable and I could tell she was actually enjoying my company. She pulled away from the curb into the road that was surrounded by trees and I kept driving with eyes on her pussy.</p> <p>"Come here and we can just sit back here for a little while and you can give him a blow job," she said. "That is, if you want to finish here."</p> <p>"Sure." I answered, not wanting to move.</p> <p>"But don't be shy; just give him some pleasure, right here, right now." she added. I smiled and nodded slowly.</p> <p>"Yes please." I pleaded.</p> <p>"It would be a lot of fun for a guy like him to have the opportunity to have a blow job from a girl like me." she finished.</p> <p>"You know I really do like the blowjob, but if they want me to give him a blowjob from a girl like you there was no point in trying to force it on him." I added.</p> <p>"Good, because we will need more room, but here let's get him all hard again." she suggested, taking my hand and pushing it to her pussy. "Look at this, your husband getting a blow job from a girl," she said, pointing to my fingers that had now found their way onto her clit.</p> <p>I quickly pulled up to a halt in the parking lot and looked into the parking lot. She was sitting in her car waiting for me. I looked around and could see her getting dressed just in time to see her husband pulling up in front of the bar.</p> <p>"Here it fucking comes, give him what he deserves." she called out as we reached her car. She got out with him in front and looked right at him. "I think he's ready," she said as she started to get into the car.</p> <p>"I'll get him, just let me see if he needs to come." she added, giving him directions.</p> <p>Just as they had agreed, she was taking our money and turning away when he arrived about 20 minutes later. I was getting impatient and had to take a hand off the wheel to go back into the pub. It would be a shame to let his ass hang there.</p> <p>"I'm going to go find my wife," I said as I backed out into the lot.</p> <p>"Just wait," she replied, looking at me, as she moved away.</p> <p>"What is happening?" I asked.</p> <p>"I want you here when they arrive so they can see you. Is that okayâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
