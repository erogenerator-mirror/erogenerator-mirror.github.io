'You're right. I don't blame you if she wasn't so cute. Look at those titties. They're not as tiny as they used to be.' He reached out a hand and helped me up onto my feet and out of the train. I was only too happy to comply. The last thing I wanted to do was walk down the middle of the city and find my way home alone with her in a black cab or two. If I lived anywhere near here it wouldn't be much better. In fact this would be just fine.</p> <p>'Thank you,' I said. I'm really happy to hear that.'</p> <p>'I'm sure the same will be said of you when you get out of the cab with her,' said the man who'd helped me out of the train. He'd caught hold of my upper arm and I couldn't stop myself from leaning in towards the rail with my back towards the driver.</p> <p>'Oh no, please don't do that, I'll only go as far as I need to for a few minutes,' I said, trying not to sound too desperate. I didn't want to do that.</p> <p>'Well, if you don't mind, I'm sure your going to be very happy,' the man said, sliding his arm around my right shoulder to release the grip.</p> <p>'That's my girl,' he said, before closing the manila envelope. He looked over to me and pointed to the backseat where I'd been. I climbed the stairs and walked to the first flight of stairs and went to check my watch, which was getting a little more than 12 hours away, to make sure and see if I just forgot to grab my keys from the desk. As it turned out, I hadn't at all.</p> <p>'Are you all ready?' asked the older man.</p> <p>'Yes,' I replied, as if I knew he knew. I didn't feel like this would be the last time I had to do this. I wasn't used to getting these kinds of answers.</p> <p>'OK, I'll leave your bag, I'll go get it, and have it delivered before it gets to the station. Then I'll let myself out of the station and call on your mobile.' He looked at me for a moment. Then, with a quick wink he reached down and picked up the bag from the ground. He stood up from the ground and began walking towards me. He turned around sharply and said, 'If you need anything, just shout.'</p> <p>I was pretty sure I couldn't refuse to use the lift as we had no one in the whole city when we left the station, so I went on the lift and stepped inside. He closed the door and was gone before I could even catch my own breath.</p> <p>This time I went straight to my room and found my keys by the door. My mobile rang a few times, I checked the time: 12:43. I had no intention of hanging the phone out of reach, so I took it and put the mobile on hold. I picked it up and went to answer the phone. It was from my mother as I'd left off at work the day before, asking me to take her to her place for an evening.</p> <p>'Hello, mother,' I told her, trying to sound calm.</p> <p>'I'm so glad you didn't forget to give me a call! Are you ready to go?' She sounded so anxious it was almost scary me to hear her talking on the phone.</p> <p>'Yes, mother. I'm ready to go,' I said, taking off the phone and taking the bag off the floor.</p> <p>'I'm just about to go,' she said, so loud that I almost jumped out of my skin!</p> <p>'OK mom. I'll be there in just a minute!' She was always so enthusiastic with her deliveries, and we rarely spoke in the middle.</p> <p>It was almost 12 pm when I turned into my mother's flat. Even the lightest breeze made my hair stand on end, and it was so pleasant that the air felt good in my face as the cold air wafted around my mother's huge flat-screened door like a cloud. I had to keep pulling my keys like that until I got inside and closed the door. It hadn't felt too weird at all in the morning when it was the way I had just been. I was happy to be in her flat and that I was there to collect her bags from her flat.</p> <p>She was also waiting up in her front waiting for me. Her clothes were on her bed. I hadn't gotten them.</p> <p>'Hello,' I said, giving her a quick hug.</p> <p>'You didn't answer your phone,' she saidâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
