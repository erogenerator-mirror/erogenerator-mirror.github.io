It just happens. It's just the fact that she has two bodies. One of them had to hold onto a very large breast for support by the nipple, and the other one had to hold onto a big breast from the nipple herself. It's as if she has to go from the bottom of her breasts to the top of her head. It looks like a very tight, small penis, and all those parts of her are able to produce.</p> <p>It had to be as hard as if it was attached to her pussy.</p> <p>When he's gone she wants to be back there. It had to be the only way she'd feel. It had to be there. She could feel him.</p> <p>She felt it.</p> <p>She had to get it. There was no way for her though. Maybe she should wait. Perhaps. Maybe not.</p> <p>But she had to go. She had to be back there. She had to make a change. She had to.</p> <p>She wasn't waiting for him. That was a real shock. There were no waiting for him this time. It was impossible. It was impossible. This was madness.</p> <p>She'd do it. She'd go back to him. It was time to take herself to him. It must be her body that could do it. It must be her body that could be with him, and make him take her back. Her body.</p> <p>And then her whole body. It couldn't be. That was the point. She had to change. She had to be back there. She had to change everything. Her body, her love, her desire, and all its meaning, all her desires, and all the feeling of being with him. That's how it must be for her. That's how he will be when he returns. That's how his body will be, if it's just her mind. This can only mean one thing. It should mean that her body has to change. That'll stop being for herself. That's what she told herself.</p> <p>Her body, her mind. Her mind, her body and her mind. What was she thinking?</p> <p>That was so unfair, and even worse than that, just so, so, so unfair.</p> <p>But she needed to go back to him. She needed to go back and make a new start. Now that he's gone she didn't want to keep going. She needed to get it over with.</p> <p>She needed to get back to him.</p> <p>That was the thing with all the things she'd done with her own body. It wasn't the same thing that she felt from her mother, or from her husband or her children. She felt from all those. They were different things. Different things that could be controlled, controlled, controlled, controlled, controlled. Those things made her experience some feeling of power, and something to do with it.</p> <p>They made her feel powerful. They made her feel powerful enough to know that she had the power.</p> <p>As she walked away she knew she didn't really seem to have. She felt empty. She knew there was no way for her to feel that way anymore.</p> <p>At first she had felt the power. She felt it just from some things. A part of herself had been made that way by her own mind, but it had come to be to be the part that made her feel such power. Those things had been there, and they were still there. Her thoughts had kept coming back. As she'd come to be able to sense what the power was and feel the power it wasn't there. As she'd learned to understand the power behind it, and all the power behind it could only be controlled by the mind.</p> <p>She knew what the power was with all the powers of her mind. She knew what it was with her body, her body, her mind, her body, all of the powers of this mind, this whole body of power. She knew it all and she had to. It had to be done. She had to take the power of her own body back. She had to give herself over completely to it.</p> <p>She'd had to. She'd learned that a lot. As a woman with more power than her own body could actually, she'd had to develop it. To be able to learn it properly and properly. If her body hadn't developed the powers she would have had a power of her own.</p> <p>But she'd never thought about it that way. Her body was a natural part of herself.</p> <p>What had been dormant for a long time had come to be brought about by some power that wasn't there, and was brought to her mind. She knew it wouldn't be possible to have a power with that power.
