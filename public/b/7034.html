I laugh, "You'd better go and put your new panties on, and I might show you the best part of home!"</p> <p>And we do as we go to the bedroom. I get dressed in front of my sexy new neighbor. I know she'll love this, seeing the two of us in my bed in lingerie. There's no way I don't.</p> <p>I go over to the closet and look around. I wonder what she's planning when she gets here. I put on a negligee, but with a matching thong I think, which looks sexy along with the skirt. I wonder if Maggie will like the outfit. In the mirror I can see that her pussy is already moist. The thong just barely covers the cheeks of my ass, which is exactly what I wear to work. And my ass cheeks are so big that I'm sure she'll love it. I could make an ass man out of her. A quick glance in the mirror and I'm on my back, my legs up and spread, my thighs up and apart. And I've heard it says that a man really has to have his cock outside of those thighs to be successful in the job. So I'm pretty stretched but I'm okay. I just may want to keep it up tonight.</p> <p>And to be honest, I'm not the most organized lover in the world right now, so I was feeling a little nervous.</p> <p>But in the end, in just three minutes, Maggie's in the bathroom, changing clothes, giving me a good look at her as I stood there waiting for her downstairs.</p> <p>"Wooo," she says, "it's gonna be so good that I actually feel like a porno star now anyway!"</p> <p>And she starts undoing her bra. I can tell she doesn't want to get it off, but it is a quick look anyway, because it's no use and she is right there. The bra falls from her perfectly rounded and perky boobs, exposing one of her pert hard little nipples to me. She turns around and looks right into my eyes. She doesn't bother with the skirt. Instead, she's completely out of her clothes, turning and pulling on her panties before coming back up again to me to put them on. I can see her smooth pussy.</p> <p>"Do you want me to put these on?" she giggles, "I thought you wanted to put a cock inside me."</p> <p>I've never been in a situation like this. This woman is naked as she is, but my prick is raging hard by now. I want to just take the chance and run in her and jump her straight in the cab right now, like I saw you do, and not be able to stop myself. But I don't think that would be wise.</p> <p>She's almost naked, and I'm naked, all of me. We've both got clothes on, and this is the moment of truth. I know that I'm about to take her to bed, and I really want to make it.</p> <p>"Are you going to take off your clothes, too," she says, "or do you want a real man, too?"</p> <p>I'm too nervous and still feeling a bit uncomfortable to really answer her right away. So I just nod my head to indicate I'm okay to undress.</p> <p>Once I'm naked and in place, I'm suddenly a nervous wreck. I can't wait to get my cock inside that pussy of hers.</p> <p>She grabs my shoulder and leads me across the bedroom toward my bedroom.</p> <p>"Is that right? Are you going to undress?" she whispers as she runs a hand down my back, along my bare ass and moves it up to my chest. I think I understand now, but I don't really know how to respond. The feeling of her hands running down my body, over my shoulders and back up is amazing. This feeling is even better than she'd been running her hands over my ass and down my legs for so long... and it makes me want to do it all... and my body wants to do the right thing as well.</p> <p>We walk through my bedroom, into the living room, and she stops to take in the huge, beautiful, king-sized bed. I can almost feel the excitement starting to take over my whole body. Everything is looking to be perfect and I'm so nervous we're going to do it all.</p> <p>There's a stack of photos in my hands, on my dresser already and a box on the end table. I've always thought we'd keep them somewhere. But Maggie has shown me so much I've never understood why she wants to keep them. I'm starting to worry.</p> <p>She picksâ€”</p><hr> <div> <a href=/l.html>Random Conditioned</a> &#183; <a href=/b.html>Random Generated</a> &#183; <a href=/sitemap.html>Site Map</a> &#183; <a href=/about.html>About</a> </div> </body> </html>
